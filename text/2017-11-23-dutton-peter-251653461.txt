LAURA JAYES:

Minister, we’ve heard conflicting reports about what’s happening on Manus Island.  What’s your understanding?

PETER DUTTON:

Well Laura, thanks very much for having us on the show.

Look, just by way of update, obviously there was a police operation this morning. PNG  police decided that they would enter the Regional Processing Centre and like us, the  PNG authorities want people to leave the centre and go to the new $10 million facility.

All of the services are provided there including medical, food, etc and we don’t want  people squatting on the military base which is where the Regional Processing Centre is.

So a number of people, I’m advised, have been moved and we would expect the  number which - up until this morning, had been about 370 people within that centre -  would drop obviously well below that now.

So there’s a lot of work that’s ongoing and the operation is still underway, but it is  important that we get people out of the Regional Processing Centre into much better  accommodation as quickly as possible.

LAURA JAYES:

So were people forcibly removed by the police and officials from PNG there this  morning and I think you’re telling me that some still remain there and are refusing to  leave?

PETER DUTTON:



Yes Laura, some of the concern is around the agitators. Like within any of these sorts of  events, you’ll have key people, people of influence and I think there are some people  who wanted to volunteer to leave, but felt that they were required to stay. I think that’s  difficult and hopefully people will voluntarily leave.

We don’t want to see any violence, the PNG authorities don’t want to see any violence,  we don’t want to see the police assaulted up there. We want to make sure that people  can move peacefully and a number of people have already moved of their own accord  and otherwise I understand there have been some arrests there as well…

LAURA JAYES:

…okay, do we know how many arrests, because we saw reports of Behrouz Boochani,  the journalist there, the Iranian journalist there being arrested. Is he among a number of  arrests?

PETER DUTTON:

Well, as I say Laura, the operation is still underway so we don’t have the final details,  but my understanding is that a number of people, a small number of people, have been  arrested including the individual to whom you refer.

So, they’re matters for the PNG police to comment on, but for us, we just want to make  sure we get people out of the processing centre as quickly as possible.

They have trashed the accommodation there, they’re living in squalor-type conditions. I  don’t want people living in that condition and unfortunately we’re still getting advocates  who are telling people not to engage, not to work with the authorities and really it’s quite  counter-productive.

W



e want people into the new facility and we hope that the rest that remain will move as  quickly as possible.

LAURA JAYES:

Minister, are you concerned, seeing some of the video that’s coming out via social  media of this operation this morning - it did descend into violence, there was some  violence and the trashing of the facilities there - but are you concerned that this might  escalate and is there anything that you can do, or are you doing anything to make sure  it doesn’t?

PETER DUTTON:

Laura, there have been lots of reports around homemade weapons, a stockpile of  improvised devices that could have been used against the police. Threats have been

made against the police. The racist taunts towards the police as well - we’ve seen  evidence of that over a period of time.

So I have been concerned that people want to escalate the mood within the centre  because there seems to be this view that if there can be a clash with the police then  somehow that footage being played in Australia will change the Australian Government  resolve in relation to not allowing people off Manus to settle in Australia…

LAURA JAYES:

….it may not be changing your resolve Minister, nor the Government’s resolve, but do  you think your losing the court of public opinion here? Do you think there’s a shift in the  views of the Australian public?

PETER DUTTON:

No I don’t. I mean, we’ve had overwhelming support for the actions that we’ve taken.

If your bulletin was filled with stories with boats capsizing at sea, kids drowning again,  kids in detention, then I think the public would be angry as they were when that  happened under the Labor Government.

We’ve not had a death at sea in over three years, I’ve got every child out of detention,  we’ve closed 17 detention centres.

But the fact is that people-smugglers are looking at the moment at what’s happening on  Manus and if they can pitch to people in Indonesia that you can wait on Manus for a  couple of years and then come to Australia, I tell you now that the boats will be back in  action and we would have the drownings at sea again.

I think the public understand what’s going on here and the public understand that we’ve  spent millions of dollars building these new facilities, providing medical support...

LAURA JAYES:

Just on those new facilities, because we spoke to Tim Costello in the last hour. He has  been on a fact-finding mission with World Vision into the new facilities and he says  they’re not finished, the basic services aren’t there, it’s not just a bit of security fencing,  he says part of this facility is just unliveable?

PETER DUTTON:

No well, it’s untrue. The fact is the East Lorengau centre has been constructed and  open over the last few years. There have been 70 odd people living there, there’s  capacity for 400, we’re nowhere near that capacity. The numbers now are - pre the

activities today - are just under or just around 200 people, so there’s plenty of capacity  to move people into East Lorengau.

There’s a new facility of Hillside Haus where the non-refugees will go to. There are two  other facilities that have been provided for overflow, if you like, once the numbers hit  400 at East Lorengau.

I don’t want people in tents and if Tim is pointing to paths that haven’t been polished or  tiles that haven’t been laid in a BBQ area or something like that if they’re a cosmetic  issues then they can raise those. But let’s be serious about it, the taxpayers have spent  million and millions of dollars supporting the PNG authorities in establishing these  facilities and people need to move out of the processing centre because it’s  unacceptable that they continue to squat there.

LAURU JAYES:

OK just two final questions.

One on the Royal Commission into banking. We have now a number of Nationals,  backbenchers that certainly want to see a Commission of Inquiry at the very least.   David Speers has spoken to John Howard about this and he has said in an interview  that going down that path would be rank socialism. Do you agree?

PETER DUTTON:

Well Laura, I’m the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection as we’ve just  established in your interview so I’ve plenty on my plate, I’ll let the Treasurer and the  Prime Minister or the Finance Minister comment on that…

LAURU JAYES:

…sure we know this has been well established and we know it was discussed in  Cabinet because we‘ve seen some helpful leaks so what would you say to your  colleagues who do want to see a Royal Commission?

PETER DUTTON:

Well that’s the other reason I wouldn’t comment on it because I don’t comment on  speculation around what’s discussed in Cabinet, I save my comments for in there and  I’ll let the Treasurer talk about these matters, I presume he won’t be talking about stuff  within my portfolio because it’s not within his lane so we’ve got defined responsibilities  and as I’ve said I save my comments on any of these matters for the Cabinet  discussion. I just don’t have any public comment to make on matters within other  Minister’s portfolios.

LAURU JAYES:



Would you feel comfortable with the investigation into Cabinet leaks then?

PETER DUTTON:

Laura, again these are issues for the Prime Minister or the Cabinet Secretary.   Everybody takes very seriously any leaks from Cabinet, we need to make sure that  there is a discussion that is frank and that’s confidential because that’s necessary and  the reality is that there have been many discussions over the course of the Turnbull  Government that have resulted in decisions that are good for our country and you need  to have frank discussions where you can express your views in favour or against, try  nuanced positions, that’s  the role of Cabinet and its worked very effectively. If there has  been a leak then that’s an issue for others to discuss.

LAURA JAYES:

This is usually something we see in the dying days of the past three Governments, is  this the case now?

PETER DUTTON:

No it’s not. I’ve been very clear about my support for Malcolm Turnbull. There is a lot of  good the Government is doing. There’s a lot of white noise around citizenship and  same-sex marriage and other issues at the moment I think once we get our way through  that I think the Government can demonstrate what we want to do for families on cutting  their electricity prices, what we want to help families on in relation to cutting taxes and  making sure they’ve got more money in their pockets so they can support their family.

Similarly, the support for business as well and from my perspective making sure that the  national security of our country remains absolutely paramount which is what I continue  to do.

LAURA JAYES:

Ok Immigration Minister Peter Dutton we thank you for your time.

PETER DUTTON:

Thanks Laura.
