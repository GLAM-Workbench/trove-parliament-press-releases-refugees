Nauru protests highlight Australia’s shame

The continued protests by refugees on Nauru show just how damaging the conditions there are, the  Australian Greens said.

“The indefensible combination of inhumane conditions and indefinite offshore detention has  brought these already vulnerable people to breaking point,” Greens’ spokesperson for immigration,  Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.

“The Government is continuing to house refugees in tents, despite temperatures in excess of 40  degrees, and has increased the stress at detention centres by suspending the processing of their  claims for asylum.

“This is in spite of the ever increasing list of organisations that are slamming the Government for its  cruel, expensive and ineffective offshore processing regime.

“If the Government was serious about saving lives at sea it would be offering people in Indonesia  and Malaysia safer pathways to resettlement in Australia, rather than stubbornly continuing with  this failed policy of offshore detention.

“The Australian Greens have been calling for a panel of independent health experts to oversee the  medical and mental health of refugees who are detained by the Government and it is now clearer  than ever why that is so important.”
