MEDIA RELEASE ÃÂ-52.

POLAND

The Acting Prime Minister,  Mr. Anthony, commented

today on the latest United States statement about Soviet

preparations for possible military intervention in Poland.

Mr. Anthony said that the Australian Government  fully shared 'U.S .  hopes that no such intervention would

occur. The Government's views about the grave consequences

of a Soviet intervention had' been made abundantly clear in

the past week, notably by the Foreign Minister in his

remarks in the ParliamentÂ·on 2nd December and in a public

broadcast yesterday.

The Government's views, moreover, have been

conveyed formally to the Soviet authorities. If the Soviet  Union were to intervene with force in Poland, Australia and

her Western partners had no doubt that very serious

consequences would arise for East-West relations, for  U .S .-Soviet relations and for the wide range of interdependent

co-operation that exists, particularly in Europe.  No country

would be immune from the effects and none, particularly the

Soviet Union, should be in any doubt as to what is at  stake. Â·

The Minister for Foreign Affairs will be calling

in the Soviet Ambassador to Australia to convey to him this ,

further expression of Australia's concern.
