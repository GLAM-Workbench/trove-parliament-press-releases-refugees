INTERVIEW WITH NICK MCCALLUM, JOHN-MICHAEL HOWSON AND DARREN JAMES  27 AUGUST 2017

Topics: Long-term welfare dependence, Jobseeker compliance, Asylum seeker income  support.

E&OE…

NICK MCCCALLUM:   Hundreds of thousands of jobseekers have reportedly cost taxpayers more than $15 billion  over past decades and are becoming dependent on welfare payments.

Human Services Minister Alan Tudge joins us. Mr Tudge, good morning. $15 billion is a lot of  money.

ALAN TUDGE:   It is a lot of money, and what we have revealed today is there are over 100,000 people who  have been on unemployment benefits for more than five years, 20,000 who have been  continuously on it for more than 10 years.

And that does not just cost money, but it is also a waste of human potential. We have got a  real problem here in terms of long-term welfare dependence which we are determined to  crack down upon.

NICK MCCCALLUM:   Okay Mr Tudge, we have been talking about this for a long, long time. Why hasn't the  Government done more about it in the past? You have been in power now for what, four  years?

ALAN TUDGE:   We have, and we have already done a lot, as you would probably know. The most important  thing is on the opportunities side.

We are growing the economy and unemployment is coming down, and we are also  introducing key things like the PaTH program, which provides specific opportunities for  unemployed people.

What we are about to start though from 1 July next year is a tougher compliance system so  that those people who are not doing the right thing face tougher penalties i.e. they are not  turning up to their job interviews, they are not job-searching properly, they are not taking  those jobs, then there will be serious penalties.

Because we have been concerned that people have been flouting the system and have been  getting away with it.

JOHN-MICHAEL HOWSON:   Minister, I think some people now have been on unemployment for so long they are  incapable of working. They just cannot motivate themselves to get out of bed in the  morning to look for job.

NICK MCCCALLUM:   Some people become professionally unemployed, don't they?

JOHN-MICHAEL HOWSON:   They do. They become lethargic, uninterested in the world around them. That is the  problem you have got to fight, to get people motivated to actually go out and work.

ALAN TUDGE:   I think you are right that long-term unemployment, or long-term welfare dependence, can  be an absolute poison on capable people because it does diminish your confidence, your  motivation, and sometimes your mental health.

We want to do everything we can to stop people being long-term to start with. But even  with these long-term people, we cannot give up on them.

We are creating these opportunities, but also we are creating that extra motivation, if you  like, to ensure that they do the job searches, to ensure that they take the opportunities  whenever they exist.

And if they do not then there is going to be more serious consequences than have existed to  date.

NICK MCCCALLUM:   Minister, I have got no problems with clamping down on those who need to go out and try  and find work, because there is a lot of those long-term unemployed started being    *Âµ*v***u*ÃÂ¢*o*}*Â«******]*v**ÃÂ¶*Z***]*ÃÂ¥**ÃÂ*ÃÂ*ÃÂª*[****v****ÃÂ*ÃÂ*[*ÃÂª*X*

I have got no problems with that. But I am concerned at the other end, of people who are  genuinely unemployed because the Newstart, to me, is way too little for them to survive  and actually go out and find a job.

It is about $240 a week if you are single, and that is really hard to bounce back from to try  and find it. Is there a carrot and a stick approach where you can improve the Newstart  Allowance for those who genuinely need it, but still be able to make it harder to get?

ALAN TUDGE:   We do have a carrot and a stick approach, and in part through this new PaTH program, Nick,  which in essence gives opportunities for unemployed people to go into an internship and

then into full-time work, and they get to keep their unemployment benefit but then get top-ups on top of that.

We think that will be a really good initiative which is being rolled out now. But on the other  hand, you also do need to have consequences for those who are not doing the right thing.

Because we know from the data that if you do the right thing, if you always do your job  search, if you always turn up to the interviews, you are far more likely to get a job than if  you continually fail to do that.

That is exactly why we are strengthening that system to create those extra incentives, if you  like, that if you continually fail to do the wrong thing there is going to be penalties.

NICK MCCALLUM:   Minister, I remember hearing you talking to Tom Elliot, it must have been about a year ago,  about this very thing. Yet I still read in the paper today, that 88 per cent of those that do not  turn up to their required interviews and job searches and stuff like that, have had no  penalty.

I mean how does that continue to happen? If you were talking about this at least a year ago,  and probably a long time before that, why hasn't been done already?

ALAN TUDGE:  We have been working on this policy for some time. I should say that we have tried in the  past to get tougher new measures through the Parliament, but it has been blocked in the  Senate.

We have now completely redesigned the system from the ground up. We have got  legislation which is the Parliament as we speak, and we hope it will go through the Senate  and start from 1 July of next year.

JOHN-MICHAEL HOWSON:   There is one other point too. There are people that are not working, they are professional  university students. They do a course, you can get a BS degree, something that will never  give them employment, then they go and do another degree, and another degree. They are  perpetually at university. And we are paying for that.

DARREN JAMES:   They have to pay for that if they ever get a job.

JOHN-MICHAEL HOWSON:   **Âµ*ÃÂ¶**ÃÂ¶*Z****ÃÂ¢*}*]*v*ÃÂ¶**]*ÃÂª**]*ÃÂ¶********}*u***ÃÂª*****Â¡***Â«**}*(*Y

DARREN JAMES:   Let me tell you, we are going through that at the moment.

JOHN-MICHAEL HOWSON:   Oh I give up. Alan, you have got the microphone, go on.

DARREN JAMES:   No but that is the point. You pay for your own university education, John-Michael. That is  the way it works.

ALAN TUDGE:   It is a combination. I mean the taxpayer funds about half of the cost of your university  education, and you end up paying about half of it yourself as well.

JOHN-MICHAEL HOWSON:   That is what I was going to say. Exactly, exactly.

ALAN TUDGE:   There are some limits in terms of what you can do and for how long you can study. Of  course we want people to get a good degree and then get a job straight after. That is the  w

hole idea.

We do not want people just to be studying for the sake of studying and taking your place  and using taxpayer's money if it is not going to lead to work.

JO



HN-MICHAEL HOWSON:   To a job. That was the point I was making. They go on forever, and there is no chance of  them ever getting them a job out of what they are studying.

DARREN JAMES:   Minister, can I also ask you on another issue. It has been reported in The Age today, that  asylum seekers who are here for medical reasons, are being told tomorrow, they are getting  a new visa tomorrow being told basically they are going off all benefits, and they have only  got three weeks to find their own accommodation. Surely that is unfair?

ALAN TUDGE:   These are people who were in the centres on Nauru or Manus Island and came to Australia  because they had a medical condition. They got treatment.

That medical condition has now been treated properly and so they have to go back to  Nauru, or to Manus, or indeed back to their home country.

We have got a very firm principle that no one can stay in this country if you arrive by boat.  And that principle is important and it has been successful of stopping the arrival of boats,  and stopping the drownings at sea. And what we a*ÃÂ¥******}*]*v*P*Y

DARREN JAMES:   But I thought Manus was closing down, isn't it?

ALAN TUDGE:   We are. We have got very few people left who are on Manus and are on Nauru. We have  got

no children anywhere in detention centres, and we have got no new people coming in,  because we have stopped the boats.

But these people have come to Australia for treatment. They had their treatment. Now they  have got to go back. And given they have to go back, I do not think it is unreasonable to say  that they are not going to get any more taxpayer's support while they are under  requirements to return.

DARREN JAMES:   So how do they then survive?

ALAN TUDGE:   They can do one of two things. Either they can do the right thing and return to Nauru, or  PNG, or back to their home country, or they can take a job in this country while they are on  *ÃÂ¶*Z***ÃÂ¶****ÃÂ¥*]***P*]*v*P**Â¿*]*ÃÂª***X***v****ÃÂ¶*Z***Â«******u****}*Âµ*ÃÂ¶**Z***ÃÂ¥****(*}*ÃÂ¥*****ÃÂ¢*Âµ*ÃÂ¥*ÃÂ¢*}*ÃÂª***Y

DARREN JAMES:   Yeah, but you know that is hard.

ALAN TUDGE:   *Ythey came out for a purpose, and that was for medical treatment. That purpose has been  d

one. Now they have to return. That is what the basis of the deal was for them coming out  in the first place.

NICK MCCALLUM:   Alright. Mr Tudge, thanks for joining us, Human Services Minister.
