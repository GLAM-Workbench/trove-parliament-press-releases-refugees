19 September 2011



DAVID SPEERS: Welcome to our panel. Joining us this morning, Liberal MP, Jamie  Briggs, and Labor's Richard Marles. Good to see you both. Welcome.

The migration debate is really gathering steam. The Prime Minister and Opposition Leader  meet today. Is there any point in this meeting, Richard, do you think?

RICHARD MARLES: We're obviously concerned about the fact that Shadow Cabinet is  meeting before that meeting. Tony Abbott said at the outset he wanted to do all this in good  faith, it was going to be constructive in terms of changes to legislation. We've seen anything

but that in the last few days.

DAVID SPEERS: What's wrong with Shadow Cabinet meeting first, though? They've got to  work out what approach he's going to take in the meeting, whether he's going to put forward  some alternatives.

RICHARD MARLES: I think the question we need to ask Shadow Cabinet is are they going  to empower Tony Abbott to have a proper, fair dinkum conversation with the Prime Minister  about trying to sort this problem or are they going to send him in with a predetermined  obstructionist position, which is aimed at saying no. And I think we know the answer to that

question.

DAVID SPEERS: Well yeah, but hang on. How constructive is the Government being here?  I mean, when the High Court ruling happened, no meeting with Tony Abbott. When you  proposed this amendment, no meeting with Tony Abbott. Now, on the eve of the legislation  being introduced, you're finally meeting with him in a last-ditch bid.

I mean, is that constructive?

RICHARD MARLES: Oh, we've provided him with legal briefings, we've been working  with him in that sense. We made it clear from the outset that we were happy to talk to him in  a context where he was willing — at least he said at the outset — was willing to talk to us in  good faith.

But we're not seeing that now. I mean this mob have stopped trying to solve this problem and  they're all about trying to play politics with it, and I think they're going to be judged harshly  as a result.

DAVID SPEERS: Jamie?

JAMIE BRIGGS: Well look, this is a Labor Party who's caused the problem who are now  seeking anyone else to help them they possibly can find. I mean, this idea that somehow the  Opposition's got to solve the Government's problem when they created this problem in the  first place is a joke.

By the way, we do have a solution to the problem…

DAVID SPEERS: It's a problem that also came from the High Court…

RICHARD MARLES: Yeah, the High Court…

JAMIE BRIGGS: No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no. This is a problem which there was no  problem in September 2008. The boats had stopped. You changed…

RICHARD MARLES: Yeah, and the High Court would rule out what you guys did.

JAMIE BRIGGS: No, no, no. You changed the law. There was High Court challenges with  Nauru previously.

RICHARD MARLES: Yeah, the High Court's made it clear that Nauru and Manus Island  under the Howard Government…

JAMIE BRIGGS: [Interrupts] Richard, Richard, Richard. No, this is somehow…

RICHARD MARLES: …could not have happened.

JAMIE BRIGGS: No, this is — this is the great Labor Party's — everyone else's fault but  theirs…

DAVID SPEERS: Jamie Briggs, there's…

JAMIE BRIGGS: …everyone else's fault but theirs.

DAVID SPEERS: No, but there's no — there's no doubt, and I'm not sure what legal  expertise you have, Jamie Briggs, but there's no doubt the High Court has put a different  interpretation on the Migration Act…

JAMIE BRIGGS: Yeah, but we've got to go back a step.

DAVID SPEERS: …that previously existed, right?

JAMIE BRIGGS: We've got to go back a step, though.

DAVID SPEERS: We know their history, we know their history…

JAMIE BRIGGS: This is the problem — no, no, no…

DAVID SPEERS: …but this High Court ruling has changed the interpretation of the  Migration Act, right?

JAMIE BRIGGS: Sure.

DAVID SPEERS: So there is some doubt about offshore processing.

JAMIE BRIGGS: Sure.

DAVID SPEERS: How strong that doubt is, whether you think Nauru might still be okay or  not, there's some doubt about it.

JAMIE BRIGGS: Sure.

DAVID SPEERS: So why not change the Migration Act?

JAMIE BRIGGS: Because our view is that we believe, our advice is, that Nauru — and you  just heard Scott say — Nauru, plus temporary protection visas, plus a range of other measures  will work.

DAVID SPEERS: You think it will, but what happens when [indistinct] …if it's knocked out  by the court?

JAMIE BRIGGS: [Interrupts] And you know what, we're so confident about this, we  actually…

DAVID SPEERS: What happens if it's knocked out by the court?

JAMIE BRIGGS: Well, they're matters you deal with then. But I mean, at this point, we  took a policy to the election — I know this is unusual for the Labor Party to understand  because they don't sort of get this, you take a policy to the election and then you stick with it.

RICHARD MARLES: Like WorkChoices. You took that to the election.

JAMIE BRIGGS: We took — well, if we want to go back to previous elections…

DAVID SPEERS: Let's not go to WorkChoices or previous elections, please.

JAMIE BRIGGS: We want to go back to prev… I mean, this — no, no, no, this idea now  that the Labor Party…

RICHARD MARLES: Has a [indistinct] mandate, WorkChoices.

JAMIE BRIGGS: No, no, but…

DAVID SPEERS: All right, let's have a look at the…

JAMIE BRIGGS: No, no, but the — now — no, no, let me just finish the point.

DAVID SPEERS: Finish please.

JAMIE BRIGGS: Now the Labor Party wants the Opposition Leader to assist and he's  always no and so forth, I just want Richard to give me one example when Labor was in  Opposition, one example where the Labor Party helped the Government. One. One, quick,  quick, one, one. Speersy, hurry up. One.

RICHARD MARLES: [Laughs] The issue here…

JAMIE BRIGGS: There is none. It's a joke.

RICHARD MARLES: The issue here is that the law has changed. Nauru and Manus…

JAMIE BRIGGS: You can't. Not one.

RICHARD MARLES: …which you guys did would not be legal now.

JAMIE BRIGGS: Not one. Not one reform in the Howard Government did you support.

DAVID SPEERS: Richard, there's not just pressure on Julia Gillard and the Government  coming from the right, from the Coalition, but also from within Labor as well.

Now, the left have seen this amendment. It was only released on Friday and it's very open  ended. It says: The minister may in writing designate that a country is an offshore processing  country. The rules of natural justice do not apply to the exercise of the power under this  subsection.

It's open slather. The minister can choose where to send asylum seekers with very few  safeguards, and when it comes to, you know, having to table any agreements that have been  made with that country or any consultations with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, it  says: a failure to comply with this doesn't affect the validity of the designation. So you can —  it's open slather.

RICHARD MARLES: Yes, but we know the answer to why, it is that because the High  Court came up with a decision, which has clearly put doubt on all offshore processing,  including Nauru and Manus, as was done by the Howard Government.

DAVID SPEERS: But there's no safeguards.

RICHARD MARLES: No, but — no, no, but what we're now trying to do is put in place  legislation which removes that doubt, which returns us to the position that everyone  understood the law to be prior to the High Court decision.

DAVID SPEERS: Why can't you have some human rights safeguards in there, because as  many in your party have pointed out — and this is your platform, ALP platform — protection  claims made in Australia will be assessed by Australians on Australian territory.

RICHARD MARLES: Yeah, well the…

JAMIE BRIGGS: That's just a platform [laughs].

RICHARD MARLES: No, no, well, the platform also makes it clear that we should be  discouraging people coming by boats and that we need to put in place protections in relation  to that as well.

DAVID SPEERS: Yeah, but what's this worth? What's the platform worth?

RICHARD MARLES: The platform's worth a lot. But the platform makes it clear that we  should be discouraging people coming here by boat, that we do need to look at our borders in  that regard and that we need to…

JAMIE BRIGGS: [Indistinct]

RICHARD MARLES: No. And that we need to be having an orderly and proper migration  process…

DAVID SPEERS: And do you assess…

RICHARD MARLES: …which involves the UNHCR.

DAVID SPEERS: …assess protection claims made in Australia, assessed by Australians on  Australian territory.

RICHARD MARLES: What we need to do is to make sure that we put in place legislation  which removes the doubt that the High Court have put in place. That's what this legislation  does. That's…

DAVID SPEERS: Even though it's going against the platform.

RICHARD MARLES: But let me — that's what — well, I don't believe it does go against  the platform. That's what the Caucus…

DAVID SPEERS: [Indistinct] …the platform.

RICHARD MARLES: And the platform, the platform has a fair bit of commentary about  dealing with migration, which in turn has been — is hard to reconcile in the context of this  High Court decision.

I mean, the fact of the matter is, the law is now different, and that's an issue for the platform  as much as it is for the Migration Act. We need to change the Migration Act to remove all  doubt.

DAVID SPEERS: And the platform.

JAMIE BRIGGS: Sounds like an [indistinct] platform.

RICHARD MARLES: And I'm sure the platform will when we look at it, but…

DAVID SPEERS: So this will be looked at the conference at the end of the year.

RICHARD MARLES: But what we need to be doing now is making sure that we remove  any doubt from the Migration Act. That's what this draft does; that's what the Caucus said we  should do last week. And I am completely happy that this draft is consistent with the Caucus'  decision.

DAVID SPEERS: If there's no agreement today between Julia Gillard and Tony Abbott,  what then? What do you do? Do you embrace Nauru? Do you just process onshore? What do  you do?

RICHARD MARLES: Oh well, let's see where we get to at that point. But we have put up a  pretty clear proposition. Let's remove doubt from the Migration Act which was created, doubt  created by the High Court — we didn't make the High Court decision, the High Court made  the decision.

JAMIE BRIGGS: You created the problem.

RICHARD MARLES: So let's remove the doubt associated with that. It's now up to Tony  Abbott as to whether he's going to do that as well…

JAMIE BRIGGS: [Laughs]

RICHARD MARLES: …so that if you were ever in government, you can implement your  policy.

DAVID SPEERS: Let's change topic. The carbon tax bill's still being debated in Parliament.  Today in The Sydney Morning Herald, some Treasury modelling of, line by line what the

carbon tax impact is going to be on various things. Milk, one cent a litre; cereal, two cents a  box.

As you can see there, some other staples; cheese, bread, wine, beer all less than 10 cents. Yes,  electricity and water and fuel are going to cost more. Those price rises are much higher. But  people won't be too worried you wouldn't think, Jamie Briggs, about the basics in the kitchen  cupboard?

JAMIE BRIGGS: Well, let's see what people have to say. I mean if this is such a great  policy, let's take it to an election. I mean, this is our point we've made for some time now. It  gets back to this whole idea about taking a policy to an election and sticking with it after. I  know it's unusual, but…

DAVID SPEERS: Yeah, but just, the question on what those price impacts are, how does  that fit with the campaign the Coalition has waged against the impact this carbon tax is going  to have?

JAMIE BRIGGS: Well it will have an impact, I mean, quite clearly. I mean, this is a part of  a model we haven't sent yet, let's be honest. But it will have an impact. I mean, quite clearly,  the electricity price impact will be significant.

Now we say the price impact will be significant — the biggest carbon tax in the world. It will  be the biggest carbon tax in the world, quite clearly. It will have a significant impact on  people's lives, and it will have very little environmental benefit. That's what we've been  saying for some time now. We maintain that position.

Now if the government's so proud of this bi... legislation, they should take it to the people. I  mean, it's a very simple thing for them to do. If they think that this is not going to have an  effect and it's going to have some great — it'll have a great environmental effect, if they think  their policy's right, let's have it off and let's have it off…

DAVID SPEERS: All right.

JAMIE BRIGGS: …and let's give people a choice.

DAVID SPEERS: On those prices, Richard, are you more comfortable, are you worried?  There's not much on milk, bread, cereal, but fuel and water is going up.

RICHARD MARLES: Oh well for — gas, electricity, water, the big ticket items in those  prices are still less than five dollars a week. And we've made it clear that the pricing was  going to be around an impact of just under $10 a week per household.

We're now seeing that on household staples like milk a cent a litre, I think it's 40 cents a week  on rent. This bells the cat on the scare campaign that's been undertaken by the other side here.  And the problem with scare…

JAMIE BRIGGS: So it's okay for small businesses?

RICHARD MARLES: The problem with scare…

JAMIE BRIGGS: The impact for small businesses is fine. Yeah.

RICHARD MARLES: …the problem with scare campaigns is that eventually reality bites.

JAMIE BRIGGS: [Laughs]

RICHARD MARLES: And people get to see that it's not the great big tax on everything  which they've been talking about for some time now. Now in terms of Jamie saying what we  take to elections…

JAMIE BRIGGS: Yeah.

RICHARD MARLES: …let's be clear. We took an emissions trading scheme to the 2007  election and the 2010 election.

JAMIE BRIGGS: Then you backed away from it.

DAVID SPEERS: Oh, hang on. Hang on. Hang on.

JAMIE BRIGGS: You backed away from it.

RICHARD MARLES: No. We did.

JAMIE BRIGGS: You rolled…

DAVID SPEERS: You didn't…no.

JAMIE BRIGGS: …you rolled Kevin Rudd.

RICHARD MARLES: No, we did.

DAVID SPEERS: At the 2010 election it was…

JAMIE BRIGGS: You did not [indistinct].

DAVID SPEERS: … we want to have a community consensus…

JAMIE BRIGGS: Exactly.

DAVID SPEERS: … on the need for action on climate change.

RICHARD MARLES: An emissions trading scheme.

JAMIE BRIGGS: No, no, no,no.

RICHARD MARLES: [Indistinct] looking at an emissions trading scheme.

JAMIE BRIGGS: A hundred and fifty people…

DAVID SPEERS: Looking at.

JAMIE BRIGGS: …150 people from the phone book to come in their cash for clunkers  vehicles…

DAVID SPEERS: Are you honestly saying there was a commitment to an emissions trading  scheme at the last election?

RICHARD MARLES: What I'm saying is — what I'm saying is that if you look at Labor —  well what I'm saying is an emissions trading scheme was very much on the table at the last  election.

JAMIE BRIGGS: Where?

DAVID SPEERS: That's a long way short of a commitment to introduce a carbon tax.

RICHARD MARLES: Well it was on the table last election.

JAMIE BRIGGS: Where?

RICHARD MARLES: And if you look…

JAMIE BRIGGS: When did you announce that?

RICHARD MARLES: …at what we've been doing since 2006 in the lead up to the 2007  election, it has been utterly clear that we have been all about an emissions trading scheme…

JAMIE BRIGGS: It wasn't clear to Kevin Rudd when they ca… when the men got him  in[sic] the knife.

RICHARD MARLES: … we've been all about emissions trading scheme and that's what  we're now doing.

DAVID SPEERS: Would it be handy to see some Treasury modelling of what the direct  action plan of Tony Abbott's going to do?

JAMIE BRIGGS: Well ours is a costed policy. We've said we'll spend $3.2 billion on  buying back emissions. That's what — it's clear, I mean we — it's a capped policy.

DAVID SPEERS: What do you think of Tony Abbott's refusal to allow offshore carbon  permits to be bought?

JAMIE BRIGGS: Well quite obviously, the government's policy will lead to higher  emissions in Australia — their own documentation says that. So the only way they achieve  their policy outcome is to buy — is by purchasing carbons from offshore.

DAVID SPEERS: Well that's what industry wants…

JAMIE BRIGGS: Carbon permits from offshore.

DAVID SPEERS: …because it's a lot cheaper to buy these permits offshore.

JAMIE BRIGGS: Well our issue is, well…

DAVID SPEERS: So do you think they should only be bought in Australia?

JAMIE BRIGGS: No, no, no. Well I think there is genuine concerns about purchasing  offshore. And we've seen in Norway — Norway's hardly third world or a developing country.  It's one of the most sophisticated countries in the world. And there's a huge carbon fraud

going on there at the moment. So there's legitimate concerns about…

DAVID SPEERS: But you know, that's identified and dealt with.

JAMIE BRIGGS: …this purchase.

DAVID SPEERS: There's mechanisms to ensure that carbon permits are legit.

JAMIE BRIGGS: From this government? This was the same government that brought us  the insulation debacle. This is the same government that brought us green loans. This is the  same government that's brought us, you know, farcical after farcical scheme….

DAVID SPEERS: All right, so — okay, but you're entirely comfortable with just having  carbon permits bought in Australia, despite all the industry groups — even the minerals  council supports buying permits offshore.

JAMIE BRIGGS: Look, I'm comfortable with our policy position which is we think we can  achieve the five per cent reduction by 2020 by a policy of direct action.

RICHARD MARLES: No one else does. Literally, no one else does.

JAMIE BRIGGS: Well no one else thinks you can fix the border security issues either,  mate…

RICHARD MARLES: [Laughs]

JAMIE BRIGGS: …because you guys caused this problem in the first place so if we want  to…

RICHARD MARLES: I want to know, are they going to submit their costings to the  parliamentary budget office?

JAMIE BRIGGS: Well let's have genuine parl…

RICHARD MARLES: That's the…

JAMIE BRIGGS: I'm glad you raised this. Let's have a genuine parliamentary budget office.

RICHARD MARLES: Seventy billion dollar black hole.

JAMIE BRIGGS: You know this farcical….

RICHARD MARLES: I mean I suppose if I had a $70 billion black hole, I wouldn't want to  show my work to the teacher either.

JAMIE BRIGGS: [Laughs] Well you do — most budgets. Last year's budget blew out by  $30 billion.

DAVID SPEERS: This is a — just finally…

JAMIE BRIGGS: Last years budget blew out by $30 billion.

DAVID SPEERS: …this is an interesting point. This Parliamentary Budget Office — there's  a real stalemate between the two sides over this issue. This was meant to be set up to end the  thing we go through at every election of; no, we wont' submit our policies for costing by  Treasury. It's stuck because the opposition doesn't want this Parliamentary Budget Office to  release all of your policies at the start of the campaign.

JAMIE BRIGGS: Sure. Well, for a couple of reasons it's actually stuck. One of the reasons  is that the Labor Government doesn't want any competitive tension in the advice. We say,  let's be the like the congressional budget office — let's give them power to go and make their  own economic forecasts and so forth. These guy s are saying no, no, no — Treasury is the  only economist in the country who'll get the economic forecast right, even though they don't.  And that's not a criticism of Treasury, they — it's a — this is a — it's the dismal science, and  then…

RICHARD MARLES: There were shadow cabinet ministers who were participating in the  committee process which came up with this recommendation.

DAVID SPEERS: Yes, it was recommended by Chris Pyne, wasn't it?

JAMIE BRIGGS: Oh okay. No, no — not it wasn't. No, there was a general principle  recommended in a report. We're making legitimate amendments. Now, you're talking about  working together on policy issues, but when it comes to this, all you want to do is play  politics. There is some…

RICHARD MARLES: You want the ability to be able to pay people — the Liberal Party to  pay people to do your costing. I mean we know what the outcomes of those costings are  going to be.

JAMIE BRIGGS: No, no we don't. No, what we say…

DAVID SPEERS: [Indistinct]. We're out of time. But we're going to end up with square one,  aren't we? We're not going to have any sort of Parliamentary Budget Office.

JAMIE BRIGGS: I hope we do because I think it would be a really good reform, and not  just for us in opposition and for the cross benchers, but when you eventually go into  opposition and you're opposition leader, mate, you will want this as an opportunity to cost  your policies.

RICHARD MARLES: We know the Libs will take a many billion dollar black hole to the  next election, that's what we know.

DAVID SPEERS: All right, we're out of time. Opposition Leader Richard Mar… sorry…

RICHARD MARLES: [Laughs]

JAMIE BRIGGS: [Laughs]

DAVID SPEERS: … Richard Marles, Labor MP and Jamie Briggs, good to talk to you both  this morning.

RICHARD MARLES: Thanks David.
