THE HON JOE HOCKEY MP

SHADOW TREASURER

DOORSTOP  MELBOURNE  11 APRIL 2013

E&OE…………………………………………………………………………………

JOE HOCKEY:

Today’s employment numbers are disappointing. I am always careful not to give a constant  running commentary on month-to-month figures but what is alarming about today, is that we  have seen the unemployment rate rise to 5.6% after the Government gave a commitment in  the last budget that it did not expect it to rise above 5.5%. This is the worst monthly figure in  10 years. The numbers do bounce around. Unfortunately when they bounced around last  month in the opposite direction the Prime Minister used other blown rhetoric praising herself  and her Government and it has all come down with a thud this month. So the numbers do  bounce around but unfortunately the trend is not going in favour of the Australian worker. If  the participation rate had been higher, then the unemployment number, of course, would have  been much higher. And this reflects what we’ve been hearing on the ground, in newspapers  and in the media in the past few months and that is that there has been a drop in employment  confidence in Australia. It is harder and not easier to employ Australians and it’s more costly  than ever to employ more Australians and the Government with its regulation and with its red  tape, with its taxation increases, is making it harder and not easier for employers and now we  are starting to feel the pain of that. I think the best way to deal with some of the challenges of  rising unemployment is to get rid of the taxes, the carbon tax and the mining tax, to get rid of  some of the burden of regulation that Labor seems to be addicted to and get some confidence  back into the economy and that’s what the Coalition is prepared to do. Questions?

JOURNALIST:

Do you accept that quite a few - a hundred thousand - jobs have been created since the  introduction of the carbon tax?

JOE HOCKEY:

What I do know is that the Treasurer promised in the budget two years ago to create 500,000  jobs by the middle of this year. He has to create over three hundred thousand jobs in a few

2



months. This is proof positive that you do not increase employment in Australia by increasing  taxes and increasing regulation. The only way to get unemployment back to the levels of the  last Coalition Government is to have a change of Government - get rid of the taxes and get rid  of the regulation.

JOURNALIST:

There’s also spending as an option.

JOE HOCKEY:

The Government hasn’t got any money to spend! The Labor Party is very good at spending  other peoples’ money but sooner or later it runs out and what we have seen is that the Labor  Party, which is addicted to spending, is now seemingly walking away from any commitment  to a Budget surplus. They have no commitment at all to living within your means and  ultimately Australian taxpayers are going to pay the price.

JOURNALIST:

Do you think the Government will be able to afford a high-speed train down the east coast of  Australia?

JOE HOCKEY:

Well I think it’s good to have long term plans but unfortunately the Labor Party is very good  at spending other peoples’ money. On this occasion I’d say to you even when the Labor Party  is cautious about spending $114 billion, it would seem to be the case that this is even beyond  the reach of the Labor Party.

JOURNALIST:

But then would you support any part of the high speed rail network though?

JOE HOCKEY:

The Coalition strongly supports infrastructure investment. We want to invest, and we’ve  already committed billions of dollars to major new road infrastructure as a starting point  along the corridor that effectively would be very similar to the Brisbane, Melbourne, Sydney,  Canberra railway. But from our perspective, you make promises you can keep. Don’t make  promises and create expectations that you cannot deliver on. That’s what the Labor Party  does, it raises expectations and then it fails to deliver and I can’t help but think that when it  comes to a very fast train, all they’re doing in the dark days towards the election is raising  expectations without any hope of actually ever delivering.

JOURNALIST:

Is it worth further consideration though?

JOE HOCKEY:

You should always consider initiatives and look at them carefully but there is a lot of  infrastructure I would love to see in Australia. I’d like to see improved port infrastructure. I’d  love to see better roads. I’d like to see cheaper electricity, more affordable electricity, more  affordable water sources. I’d like to see better education, better healthcare. But, quite frankly,  when the Government raises expectations about yet another project, that it just won’t be there  to deliver, I’m just a little bit cynical - forgive me - but I’m just a little bit cynical on this.

JOURNALIST:

Do you think the high speed rail could ever get done?

JOE HOCKEY:

I would hope one day it would be done, but I would expect as many people  look at it in the  starkness of daylight, they would say we would need a much bigger population to sustain it. I  came down to Melbourne on a plane today and it was a pretty good trip. I’m not saying that it  is always going to be the answer but, frankly, there is lots of infrastructure that is a priority  for Australia and better health and education are two of them.

JOURNALIST:

What about the Melbourne Metro Tunnel? Are there any developments on the Coalition’s  policy towards funding that?

JOE HOCKEY:

We’ve committed money to infrastructure here in Melbourne. We will continue to commit  funding to infrastructure that helps to improve the productivity of the nation. I think that’s the  key point. When you have projects it’s important to have full cost benefit analysis of the  money that is being spent and the project that is being proposed. If the Labor Party applied  just a touch of the same common sense to the NBN, as it has been relatively realistic about a  very fast train, then perhaps we wouldn’t have a massive blow out in the cost of the NBN and  a failure for the NBN to reach its targets.

JOURNALIST:

You said you hoped the high speed rail does get done eventually.  If the Coalition is elected  will it invest any amount of money in the high speed train?

JOE HOCKEY:

From our perspective, rail is part of a transport system delivered by state Governments. There  is no use having duplication. So you would want to sit down with the state Governments and  work through the numbers on a very fast train.  I think there would be a lot of effort going  into this. There is plenty of other infrastructure that should be a priority. Health and education  are two of those areas that deserve more infrastructures and sometimes when you have  limited money you have got to have your priorities right.

JOURNALIST:

But this would be a major national project and the Government has committed to working on  it with states. What’s the problem with the rest of it?

JOE HOCKEY:

It is just a question of money - that’s the starting point. How much money do you have? And  what could you have used the money for instead of using it for a very fast train? I’d be  interested to hear what Wayne Swan has to say about this project and whether he is going to  start factoring it into his budgets. I’d be very interested in that one.

JOURNALIST:

Denis Napthine is not getting any sympathy from you at all about a Coalition Federal  Government giving money to the Melbourne Metro Train Tunnel.

JOE HOCKEY:

We are always prepared to work with the states, whether they be Liberal or Labor to work  through the challenges of infrastructure. We will do that in a co-operative way, but as a  starting point, rail infrastructure is the responsibility of the states.  We’ll put in for roads,  we’ll put in for a whole lot of other infrastructure but, as a starting point, whether its state  Government or the federal Government it’s the same taxpayer. It’s the same person that foots  the bills - whether it is state or federal - but ultimately the buck has to stop, the buck of  responsibility has to stop somewhere and on rail it has traditionally been the responsibility of  the states. They’re the ones that determine the needs; they’re the ones who should roll out the  programs in relation to rail. The Commonwealth Government has traditionally been in the  business of funding roads but you know of course we are prepared to discuss things with  colleagues at a state level.

JOURNALIST:

Just on asylum seekers quickly. A Defence Chief from the Howard era said the politics to  turn back the boats in international waters equates to an act of piracy. What is your response  to that?

JOE HOCKEY:

I haven’t heard that comment.

JOURNALIST:

Well in terms of international law.

JOE HOCKEY:

I’m familiar with the laws but I haven’t heard that comment. The most dangerous thing I  could do is pass comment on someone else’s reported comment

JOURNALIST:

You were in a Richmond jacket before there…[INAUDIBLE]

JOE HOCKEY:

I can’t claim to have been born into an AFL family or to have even played AFL but  Richmond won me over when I attended “Dreamtime at the ‘G” back in 2007 and I have  taken a passing, perhaps a little more of a discreet interest, in Richmond since that time. I  really like the values of the club and I was very keen to support the Punt Road redevelopment  here. I really like the way they reach out to the broader community. I had a chat to a number  of the kids that are in one of the Outreach Programs and I do it quietly because I think its  important that mentoring for young leaders tomorrow - particularly indigenous leaders of  tomorrow - I think we all have to put in our little bit and Richmond Football Club does a  great job, a great job in that regard.

JOURNALIST:

Would you support AFL footy being played here again?

JOE HOCKEY:

I know my antenna is going off and saying don’t buy into that argument!

JOURNALIST:

Just in regards to the NBN…

JOE HOCKEY:

NBN, yes.

JOURNALIST:

There have been comments.

JOE HOCKEY:

It’s a great paddock, it’s better than the SCG. It is a great credit to Richmond.

JOURNALIST:

Just on the Coalitions plan on the NBN, there are calls that there won’t be near enough speeds  for businesses and homes.

JOE HOCKEY:

Look I’m getting 3-5 megabits per second at home. The Coalition is promising at least 25  megabits per second in a short period of time. That sounds pretty good to me as a consumer.  You know what - and even better to me - is it is $60 billion cheaper than what the Labor  Party is offering. Now I know, to a lot of people that are commenting on the debate about

National Broadband, money doesn’t matter. But I’ll tell you what, to taxpayers it matters.   And a $60+ billion difference between what the Labor Party is rolling out and what the  Coalition is going to rollout means a lot to taxpayers and means a lot to families that are  struggling with increasing costs of living.
