Michael Keenan MP - Federal Member for Stirling PM Agenda Interview with David Speers June 05, 2013

Topics: National security breach

David Speers

The man who has been pursuing the Government this afternoon in Parliament and throughout this week is Michael Keenan, Shadow  Minister for Justice, Customs and Border Protection, who joins me now. Thank you for your time.

Michael Keenan

Good to be with you.

David Speers

Let’s start with who this man is? What do we know about him and what has he actually been convicted off?

Michael Keenan

What we know was put on the record at Senate Estimates last week and that he is a member of the Egyptian Islamic Jihad  organisation and he has been convicted of crimes such as premeditated murder, firearm offences, explosive offences and the  Islamic Jihad organisation is an organisation that has been involved in terror for forty years. They merged with al-Qaeda in 2001 and  the leadership of al-Qaeda has now been furnished from that organisation. That includes Ayman al- Zawahiri, who is the current  head of al-Qaeda and Mohamed Atta who led the September 11 attacks in the United States. These two individuals share  membership with the man that the Government detained at a low security facility in the Adelaide Hills.

David Speers

Let me just point out the Ian Rintoul, who is a well known refugee advocate, says that he was framed by an Egyptian Mubarak era  military court and that the convictions of murder and terrorism charges that he was never convicted of those and that the only  outstanding charge against him that he was a member of that Jihadist organisation. Who is right here? In the Senate evidence you  point to how solid was that?

Michael Keenan

We have extensive evidence given to the Senate Committee from both ASIO and the AFP and quite frankly we have not one fact  that contradicts that.

David Speers

So you are confident that this man has been convicted in a legitimate court on murder and terrorist charges?

Michael Keenan

I am very confident that the evidence that was presented by ASIO and the AFP to the Senate Committee is correct and clearly that is  what we have based our concerns about this individual on. Now there might be alternative views out there but there is not one  contrary fact that anybody can point to that we have seen to date.

David Speers

The other facts that we know are that ASIO raised their concerns with the Department of Immigration last year in August, 30th August, but he still wasn’t shifted until April this year to a higher security detention centre. Where do you believe things went wrong?

Michael Keenan

Can I just say ASIO notified the Department on the 30th August last year. The AFP, who were apparently conducting a parallel  investigation, came to the same conclusion about who this individual was and they also notified the Department of Immigration on  the 14th November, yet nobody in the Government did anything until the Minister was apparently informed after a media inquiry was  made to his office and subsequently this individual was moved. This of course is an admission by the Government that the nature of  his detention in the Adelaide Hills was never satisfactory for such a serious criminal.

David Speers

We also now know that a submission from the Department went to the then Minister Chris Bowen in September last year. We don’t  know, because it wasn’t signed by the Minister, whether he saw it or what he did with it but does that clear the Department here that  they did actually pass on a submission to the Minister?

Michael Keenan

It is never about the Department. The Government takes responsibility for what happens in the Department. It is never about the  Department and we need to find out for instance what happened there and this is why we are calling for an Independent inquiry.  David what has happened here is an absolute shambles. We have Government agencies that don’t talk to each other and apparently  don’t inform their Ministers and it is the Ministers and the Government that have to take responsibility for that. They need to take  responsibility for the fact of what happens within their own departments. That is the system that we operate under and what has

happened here is a national security disaster and is a complete and utter shambles.

David Speers

You say national security disaster. That is a pretty strong form of words there, this man never got out of detention though?

Michael Keenan

But it is the nature of detention and the fact that he was detained within a low security family facility in the Adelaide Hills. They have  had teenagers walk out of that facility and go and pick fruit. This is not an appropriate place to put such a serious convicted terrorist  and the Government has admitted that because when the media inquired and apparently informed the Government about what was  happening here they moved him instantly into the more secure environment of Villawood.

David Speers

The Minister yesterday offered a briefing to the Opposition on this, have you taken it up yet?

Michael Keenan

We are very keen to have that briefing.

David Speers

When will that happen?

Michael Keenan

We are keen to get it as soon as possible and I understand that the Government is trying to facilitate that. We want that briefing to be  from all three agencies that have been involved.

David Speers

ASIO, AFP and the Department?

Michael Keenan

Yes and I understand they are trying to facilitate that and we would certainly welcome getting the full facts in this case.

David Speers

You have criticised the limitations on the inquiry the Prime Minister did announce today by the Inspector General of Security and  Intelligence because it is not going to cover the Department and presumably it won’t cover the Minister’s office either. So given that  you may well in September win the election and take responsibility for these departments, will you do the job then?

Michael Keenan

I think it is very important that we understand what has happened here. We need to understand what has happened if we are going  to fix the problem. We would firstly like the Government to fix its own mess and have a real fair dinkum inquiry into this and that is an  inquiry that would of course include the Department of Immigration and the Australian Federal Police.

David Speers

If they don’t, you will?

Michael Keenan

Absolutely, we need to understand what’s happened here if we are going to prevent it from happening again.

David Speers

And if indeed this man does end up being found to be deserving refugee protection in Australia, what should happen?

Michael Keenan

We don’t owe any protection to somebody who poses a security risk. That is explicitly stated in the United Nations Refugee  Convention.

David Speers

So what are you going to do with him?

Michael Keenan

We will wait to receive that full briefing from the departments as we have requested from the Government for some time before we  can come to a categorical answer on that.

David Speers

But it is not clear cut is it that you could just send him back to Egypt?

Michael Keenan

What I can categorically say is that if we were in Government we would work day and night to make sure nobody that poses a threat  to the Australian community is allowed to remain here.

David Speers

Michael Keenan we will have to leave it there. Thank you for joining us.

Michael Keenan

It was my pleasure.
