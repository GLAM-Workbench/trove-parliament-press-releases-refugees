MIGRANT CENTRE ACCOMMODATION FOR THE NEEDY

Migrant centre accommodation will be made available to those  with the greatest need for the Government's on-arrival  programs,the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, John Hodges said today.

From 1 February 1983 refugees will be allowed to stay for  26 weeks in order to complete on-arrival English and  orientation classes. This period is longer than the present  average stay in centres and will give migrant centre residents  ample time to seek accommodation and employment outside in the  community.

Subsidised accommodation will also continue to be provided  for such special categories as entrants under the Special  Humanitarian Program and welfare cases.

"In the present economic climate subsidised migrant centre  accommodation for migrants selected under the labour shortage  categories including the employer nomination scheme can no  longer be justified," Mr Hodges said.

"Migrants selected under the labour shortage categories will  be expected to provide their own accommodation. This will  bring them into line with family reunion migrants whose  accommodation is not subsidised in any way.

"Transitional measures will apply to migrants in the labour  shortage categories.

"Those approved beforeâ€™February and who arrive in Australia  before August 1983 will be allowed to stay in migrant centres  for 10 weeks if they speak English .or 26 weeks if they need  to attend on-arrival English classes."
