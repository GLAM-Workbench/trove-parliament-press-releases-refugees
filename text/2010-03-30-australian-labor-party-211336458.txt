Interview with Sky News Topics: Stern Hu, asylum seekers

Transcript, E&OE

30 March 2010

DAVID SPEERS: Stephen Smith, thank you for your time. Stern Hu was originally accused of paying bribes; then that

was changed to taking bribes. He was originally accused of stealing state secrets; that was then changed to

commercial secrets.

It's all very confusing. Can you now explain with any clarity exactly what Stern Hu did wrong?

STEPHEN SMITH: Well, in terms of the bribery charge and conviction, he received nearly AU$1 million from two

private Chinese steel mills. That was in exchange, effectively, for the direction of iron ore contracts in their direction. On

the advice that I have from officials in the courtroom, there was sufficient evidence for one to draw the conclusion that

acts of bribery had occurred.

As I made the point yesterday, I think the sentence he received in that respect was pretty tough.

Secondly, on the commercial secrets, yes, you're quite right. The original suggestions was espionage or stealing state

secrets, and that was subsequently changed when he was formally detained and charged to stealing commercial

secrets.

Regrettably because the trial was closed to Australian officials on that front, we're not really in a position to give the

same analysis or commentary about that part of the trial, and that is the difficulty that I've referred to.

DAVID SPEERS: Are you saying you're not sure that there's any evidence there of stealing commercial secrets?

STEPHEN SMITH: We now have a 71-page judgment which will need to be translated and then pored over, not just by

Australian officials but no doubt by Rio Tinto, the employer, but also by the Australian and the international business

community.

The lost opportunity here is that as China emerges into the international economy and as it deals in international

economic matters, the clarity that the international business community needed was whether in this matter we were

dealing with or talking about things that were normally commercially available in the public arena or in the marketplace,

or something broader or deeper than that.

And that's where the lack of clarity occurs. There's no clarity from China here as to whether we're dealing with what the

international business community or the Australian business community would simply regard as the normal ebb and

flow of commercial discussions or commercial information.

DAVID SPEERS: Does that lack of transparency therefore leave other businesspeople in China at risk of a similar fate

if they're simply engaging with information and material that in other parts of the world would be the normal course of

business, but in China it may be treated as commercial secrets?

STEPHEN SMITH: Well, this is the potential difficulty so far as ongoing confidence is concerned that we've made to

China before and which obviously I made publicly yesterday.

It was, in our view, a lost opportunity that's obviously had repercussions for Stern Hu and the other three employees.

But it may well have repercussions in terms of the international community's dealing with China.

Now, that'll be a matter for the international business community, but some of the commentary you've seen this

morning does tend to reinforce that point. So it…

DAVID SPEERS: You said something, you as Foreign Minister, would warn Australian businesspeople to be aware of,

to be wary of in China?

STEPHEN SMITH: It's a matter for Australian business or Australians generally that when they are living or working or

operating in another country, they are bound by the laws and the processes of that country. And for example, our travel

advice for China indicates that China runs a system where there are tough sentences for things that we would regard

as being relatively minor.

But it's a matter for the international business community to now make those judgments. As I say, we've made that

point to China before. We'll no doubt make it again.

But importantly, I think no one is suggesting that the international business community is going to cease its relations

with China. We want China to emerge not just economically but as a responsible international citizen.

DAVID SPEERS: But clearly, this is a concern for them. The fact that part of the trial was closed is something that

you're facing criticism for that, Australia could have fought harder to allow at least Australian consular access to the

trial.

Now, we do have a consular agreement with China that is supposed to allow access to all court proceedings against

Australian citizens.

Can you explain why that didn't hold up here?

STEPHEN SMITH: It's a consular agreement with China that was struck in 1999-2000 by the previous Government.

And it says that yes there should be access in such matters, but it also expressly says that the consular agreement is

subject to the laws of China and the laws of Australia.

Now, just as in Australian law, I'm advised in Chinese law it's open to a court in particular circumstances to close the

court.

DAVID SPEERS: But here it's national security matters only that close a court generally.

STEPHEN SMITH: But nonetheless, it's open to an Australian court from time to time to close a court if it so chooses.

That is part of Australian law, just as I'm advised that part of Chinese law is that from time to time, at the request of a

party to a case if commercial inconfidence matters are subject to exposure, it's open to a party to such a matter to

request that it be closed. Now…

DAVID SPEERS: On what grounds? It seems like an incredibly grey area.

STEPHEN SMITH: It is a commercial in-confidence area. Now, let me just take you through the process.

Australian officials made representations to Chinese officials that the court should be open for all purposes. When that

request was rejected by Chinese authorities and the Chinese Shanghai Court, we repeated our request and asked for

that decision to be reconsidered.

I called the Chinese Ambassador to Australia in and made the point to him very strongly that I thought this was a

mistake, that not only wasn't it in Stern Hu's or Australia's interest, it wasn't in China's interest because…

DAVID SPEERS: But could you have challenged that legally though, apart from…

STEPHEN SMITH: ...under the Consular Agreement struck by our predecessors — and I make that point for the

obvious reason — this is one issue that the Opposition are encouraging a spotlight or focus on. Under that Agreement

signed up by our predecessors, there is no capacity for arbitration or appeal under the Consular Agreement.

And so far as the court case is concerned, we had no standing. Stern Hu and his lawyers had standing; we were there

as consular officials. So I don't regard any of that criticism as being valid.

The Consular Agreement expressly states that it is subject to the laws of Australia and the laws of China. The laws of

Australia and the laws of China both open up the possibility of a closed court hearing. In this case, the very strong case

I put to the Chinese Ambassador, repeated by officials in Beijing, Canberra and Shanghai, was that this was a mistake.

And that's been now part of the cause for the lack of transparency and lack of analysis on the…

DAVID SPEERS: The Consular Agreement therefore wouldn't seem to be worth the paper it's written on.

STEPHEN SMITH: Well, that's not true either.

DAVID SPEERS: But if it can be overruled, without an explanation as why…

STEPHEN SMITH: That is not true either. I've dealt with one particular matter that is subject to Chinese or Australian

laws. In the meantime, once a month, indeed in practice once every three to three-and-a-half weeks, our officials had

access to him in detention…

DAVID SPEERS: Sure, but the court…

STEPHEN SMITH: …and was satisfied as to his…

DAVID SPEERS: To actually observe the court trial, there's no guarantees on that. That can be shut off by China and

there's no course to repeal — to appeal, as you admit.

STEPHEN SMITH: Yes, other than to make the point, as I did very strongly, to Chinese officials…

DAVID SPEERS: Which got you nowhere.

STEPHEN SMITH: Well, it was a mistake. And as a consequence of that mistake, we've seen what I've described as

the lost opportunity so far as China is concerned to help clarify these matters.

DAVID SPEERS: Minister, do you think that the Chinese Government or the Communist party approved this court

decision?

STEPHEN SMITH: The advice I have is that this trial and these processes were consistent with Chinese law and

Chinese processes. Now, we have different systems…

DAVID SPEERS: Independent of the Government and the Communist Party…

STEPHEN SMITH: No, we have different systems, we have a different system so far as our legal operations are

concerned and we have…

DAVID SPEERS: We have judicial independence.

STEPHEN SMITH: We have no option but to respect the judicial and legal sovereignty of China so far as China is

concerned.

DAVID SPEERS: But in your mind is that independent from the Chinese Government and Communist Party or not?

STEPHEN SMITH: Well as I say, they have their own system; it's a different system from ours. I'm not seeking to

impose our system on them, what we have said both in terms of China…

DAVID SPEERS: Is their systems one that includes political interference?

STEPHEN SMITH: Other people can make their judgements or commentary about that…

DAVID SPEERS: What's your observation?

STEPHEN SMITH: My observation is that they have a different system than we do, we respect their legal and judicial

processes and their sovereignty, we have no option other than to do that, and within their processes we worked very

hard in cooperation with Rio Tinto to do our best to maximise Stern Hu's interest. That included consular access to him

and it included access to part of the trial.

DAVID SPEERS: You've said this won't affect Australia's relationship with China, it won't have an adverse impact were

your words on the relationship, but you have expressed disappointment at the outcome, you've left a question mark

over one of the verdicts, the stealing commercial secrets, you've described the sentence as very harsh, in this situation

where you are being openly critical of the Chinese legal system, how can this not impact relations?

STEPHEN SMITH: What I've just said to you is that the Australian Government respects the legal processes and the

legal and judicial sovereignty of China. We have no other option other than to do that.

I've been critical of the lack of transparency on the commercial secrets matter and I believe that the sentence was

harsh by Australian standards, indeed by any measures.

But we had our tensions and difficulties last year on a range of matters including the initial detention of Stern Hu. But I

have the view that the events of yesterday won't adversely impact on our bilateral relationship. We learnt a lot from last

year.

I think that both Australia and China are understood that there'll always be a range of issues where we'll have a

different view, indeed different values, and indeed different systems. We need to learn to manage those and take a

long-term view so part of the experience of last year which we worked our way through by the end of the last year, got

the relationship back on track. Part of that learning experience was to understand how to better manage those

circumstances where we do have different values or different systems or different approaches.

So I'm absolutely confident that there won't be any adverse repercussions so far as the bilateral relationship is

concerned but we will as we have in the past continue to make our points to the Chinese authorities about these

matters of transparency, so far as so called commercial secrets are concerned.

DAVID SPEERS: And Minister just on a final issue. One hundred boat loads of asylum seekers have now arrived

under the Rudd Government's watch as you know, do you think there needs to be a stronger deterrence to stop people

making this dangerous journey to Australia?

STEPHEN SMITH: The Minister for Immigration and I have made the point for the last year or so that given the very

serious security situation in Afghanistan, particularly 2008/2009, the end of a 25-year conflict in Sri Lanka, we were

always going to be subject to these very strong push factors and recent reports from the United Nations High

Commissioner for Refugees have borne this out. We've got large numbers of displaced people moving throughout our

region, not just Afghans from Afghanistan but also Sri Lankans from Sri Lanka.

DAVID SPEERS: But do we need to do more to deter them coming?

STEPHEN SMITH: We're working very hard with source countries, Afghanistan, Sri Lanka, with transit countries,

Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and the rest of our region through the so called Bali Process to deal with this very

difficult problem.

DAVID SPEERS: Is the current deterrence if any, working? Is the current system working?

STEPHEN SMITH: We are working very hard. We've enhanced our border protection surveillance mechanisms, and

we've enhanced our regional engagement with our partners.

But the reality is that we face large numbers of displaced people, primarily as a result of 2008/2009 being the worst

security times we've seen in Afghanistan for a considerable period and the aftermath of a conflict in Sri Lanka.

This has caused millions of people to move, not in just in Australia's direction but throughout the world and we're not

the only country or the only region trying to grapple with these difficult problems.
