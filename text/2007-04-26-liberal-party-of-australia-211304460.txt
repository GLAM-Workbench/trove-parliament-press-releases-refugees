Changes to Skilled Temporary Visa Programme

Doorstop: Treasury Place, Melbourne

E&OE…

MINISTER ANDREWS:

Ladies and Gentlemen, today I’m announcing changes to the temporary  skilled migration programme and the visa requirements in relations to that  programme.  The changes are three fold; firstly can I say that this has been a  very successful programme in terms of ensuring the continued prosperity of  Australia’s economy.  With the lowest unemployment rates in Australia for 30  years there are areas in need that we have to bring in people with skills from  overseas to ensure that industries continue to thrive, and therefore the  economy itself continue to move forward, and Australian’s can be employed in  jobs and the temporary skilled migration programme has been a significant  factor in ensuring our continued economic prosperity.  The three changes are  firstly that for those employers and sponsor who have a demonstrated good  track record, in terms of employing people under this programme and doing  the right thing, they will be fast tracked in terms of their applications in the  future.  Secondly for those few people out there who have sought to abuse  the programme, I’m announcing a range of new penalties which will apply to  them in the future.  Where somebody, for example, seeks to bring a person in  from overseas and not pay them the required salary, there will be a new civil  penalty.  Where a person brings in another employee from overseas,  purportedly to be employed in particular skill but is then in an unskilled  occupation, then they too will also be subject to a new penalty.  We don’t want  abuse of the system, it’s not widespread but nonetheless any abuse can  undermine the importance of this programme for our national prosperity into  the future.  The third major changes is in relation to the standard of English  required of a person coming in under the programme, and in future a person  will have to have what is known as 4.5 on the English standard which is  basically workplace competency in terms of being able to use the English  language.  This is important from a whole range of perspectives, not the least  of which is ensuring that people working in workplaces in Australia are able to  understand the occupational health and safety requirements of working in any  particular workplace.

Can I say something about another matter, I read in the paper this morning  that the Labor Party through its spokesman Mr Burke is planning to push at  this weekend’s Labor conference a bid to abandon a policy of giving the boat  people only temporary protection.  This is quite a significant departure from  the border protection regime that we have in place in Australia.  And it’s a  further (inaudible) of what’s emerging in Labor’s weak policy of border  protection.  Firstly, Mr Burke has said that we will process people on  Christmas Island and not process them on Nauru.  Secondly, he’s said in the  past that we will bring people to Australia and that we will in effect make them  residents of Australia.  And thirdly now it’s been revealed that he would  abandon the temporary protection visa regime which means that they would  definitely become permanent residents of Australia under this proposal.

I’ve said in the past that Labor’s policy is a green light to people smugglers,  this is quite clearly another step in that policy which would open the borders of  Australia to anybody who wanted to pay $10,000 to get on a leaking fishing  vessel and come across the Indian Ocean to Australia.  Labor is very weak on  border protection and this further significant announcement that’s been  revealed this morning of what Labor is trying to do this weekend just shows  that they won’t stand up for Australia’s interest in this regard.

QUESTION:

Of the detail of the policy, what are the penalties that you would (inaudible)?

MINISTER ANDREWS:

The penalties will mirror the penalties in the Workplace Relations Act.  There’s  also in this context a significant role for the Office of Workplace Services.  The  Office of Workplace Services now can act as a prosecuting body in relation to  a range of workplace penalties and because that specialised agency is there  we’re proposing to give it additional powers in relation to these migration  matters.  Now I note that the Office of Workplace Services is one of the bodies  which Mr Rudd and Ms Gillard wish to abolish, although earlier in the week Mr  Burke was saying that the role of the Office of Workplace Services would  continue.  They obviously hadn’t spoken to each other about what Labor’s  future direction is.  But this would be disastrous if the Office of Workplace  Services was abolished under Labor.  Not only that, if I can say something  about the IR policy, what we have now is a policy which would abolish all of  these offices like Workplace Services, which has been there to protect  employees, abolish the Australian Building Construction Commission which  has been spectacularly successful in terms of cleaning up the commercial  building industry in Australia, removing strikes, higher productivity flowing from  that, that would be abolished as well.  But worse than that, all (inaudible) the  Fair Pay Commission role in relation to minimum wages would be put into one  body.  So you have one body which is the prosecutor and the judge and they  jury, the mediator and the determinator [Sic], or the body that determines  minimum wages.  This is a return to a centralised regulatory system of the  past which Mr Rudd wants, and in relation to immigration we wouldn’t have a  body like the Office of Workplace Services which could go in there and audit  businesses and do the sorts of things which we are proposing in this policy.

QUESTION:

What measure would there be for repeat offenders who have regularly  brought in workers under false circumstances?

MINISTER ANDREWS:

Well up until now the penalty has been that you can be precluded from  sponsoring an overseas worker in the future.  And my view has been that that  is not a sufficient penalty and that’s why in addition to be precluded from  bringing anybody into Australia, you will also face civil penalties under the  legislation, so you could be fined under this legislation if you do the wrong  thing.  It’s a good programme, we want to continue the programme, it’s good  for Australia, it’s good for Australian workers, it’s good for the Australian  economy because it helps us prosper into the future so that’s why we don’t  want people in any way abusing this programme.

QUESTION:

(Inaudible)

MINISTER ANDREWS:

Yes, the civil penalties are prosecutions, yes.

QUESTION:

These changes, do they come about from the Parliamentary inquiry into the  skilled migrants programme?

MINISTER ANDREWS:

No, no these were things which I looked at.  In fact I’ve been looking at in my  previous portfolio of Employment and Workplace Relations because there’s a  cross over between, obviously, the employment in this regard and the skilled  migrant programme.  And something which I’ve been considering in the latter  part of last year.  And then when I came into this portfolio I asked my  department to look at it more closely and as a result of that work over the last  couple of months we’ve come up with this proposal.

QUESTION:

When will there be any announcement from the inquiry, whether there are any  changes that are a result from that?

MINISTER ANDREWS:

This is the parliamentary inquiry that’s undergoing at the moment?  Well that  inquiry has to conclude for the parliamentary committee to make its  recommendations.  Mr Randall is the Chair of that inquiry and in the normal  course we would look at what recommendations are made by the inquiry and  the Government will respond in the normal way.

QUESTION:

Would the employer or would the DIAC be responsible for approving the  applicants English proficiency?

MINISTER ANDREWS:

The English proficiency in many cases would be able to be established before  a person comes to Australia.  But there will be a role here for the Department  to ensure that there is English proficiency required.  We believe that a certain  level of English proficiency is important in a workplace in Australia and that’s  why this is a new requirement which will be introduced.

QUESTION:

Has that been a concern of employer groups?

MINISTER ANDREWS:

It hasn’t been a wide ranging concern of employer groups but from time to  time there’s been an allegation raised that somebody simply doesn’t have the  requisite level of English in order to be able to properly function within a  workplace, and I believe that there ought to be a basic level of English  functioning within a workplace and that’s what this new requirement will  implement.

QUESTION:

Did you foresee the circumstances emerge where people have exploited  workers and exploited the system?

MINISTER ANDREWS:

Any system is subject to the people who operate within the system and sadly  human nature doesn’t seem to have changed over the centuries.  So there is,  regrettably, from time to time a very few people who will seek to exploit any  system that’s put in place.  Now, our role is to ensure, where possible, that we  can diminish the opportunity for people to exploit the system.  But can I repeat  my opening words and that is this has overwhelmingly been a successful  system.  The incidents of abuse are very small, we don’t want any and that’s  why we’re making these changes.  Overall this has been a very successful  system and employers and sponsors have made use of the system in a way.   But bringing someone in on a skilled temporary visa is not a right it’s a  privilege and therefore people should understand that that privilege carry’s  with it certain responsibilities.  Those responsibilities are paying the  appropriate wage, to use the person in a skilled occupation and not to be  seeking to subvert the system and use someone in an unskilled job, and that’s  what we would seek to ensure.

QUESTION:

(Inaudible)

MINISTER ANDREWS:

The monitoring happens in a couple of ways, or the overall system, obviously  when people go overseas they often use offshore companies in terms of that  recruitment process.  The procedures follow vary from country to country as to  the way in which those offshore companies work, but this is sending a clear  message to them that you shouldn’t seek to send to Australia somebody who  hasn’t got the adequate level of English to be able to function in an Australian  workplace, and you shouldn’t be seeking to send to Australia somebody who  is essentially unskilled rather than a skilled person.  So that will flow through  the process, monitoring obviously can only occur by Australian agencies  within Australia because of the sovereign issues of the jurisdictions they have  which is basically within Australia.  There’ll be a clear message that comes out  of this to people who are offshore, not just those who are onshore.

QUESTION:

(Inaudible)

MINISTER ANDREWS:

There will be some random audits, if I can put it that way in relation to people.   Now I’m not setting a particular target in relation to that.  You need flexibility to  be able to respond to whatever the circumstances are but a sponsor should  know that there is a possibility that somebody might be required, particularly in  relation to English, to actually demonstrate that they have that working level of  knowledge of English.

Thank you.

[Ends]
