Abbott should offer refugee status to Iraqis in trouble: Bandt

[12 August 2014]

The Greens today called on more to help the people of Iraq.

“If it’s Australia’s intent to assist in the humanitarian mission to Iraq, Tony Abbott should offer  refugee status to Iraqis in trouble, including the Yezidi people who are fleeing persecution, in  addition to our humanitarian refugee intake,” said acting Greens Leader Adam Bandt MP.

“At the same time, Tony Abbott needs to rule out sending Iraqis in our detention centres back to  a war zone. To continue to send Iraqi asylum seekers back into a war zone will surely put them  in harm’s way.

“With the situation worsening in Iraq every day, a moratorium on returning Iraqi asylum seekers  back to the conflict zone is the right thing to do.
