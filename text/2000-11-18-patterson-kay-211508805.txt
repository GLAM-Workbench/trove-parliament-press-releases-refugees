"Since its beginnings, the AMEP has grown to be world leading English Language and Settlement service, annually providing English language tuition to around 36,000 newly arrived migrants and refugees from nearly 100 language backgrounds.

The AMEP is administered by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs.

"Professional development opportunities such as the conference are vital to keeping the AMEP progressive and helping us to ensure that it maintains its reputation for innovation and excellence in the delivery of English as a second language tuition," she said.

The conference will feature two speakers of international repute: Professor Denise Murray, AMEP Research Centre Director, from Macquarie University, Sydney and Professor Allister Cumming from the University of Toronto, Canada. It will be attended by about 200 delegates.

The conference is the first to be held under the auspices of the new AMEP Research Centre, formed through a partnership between Macquarie and La Trobe Universities.
