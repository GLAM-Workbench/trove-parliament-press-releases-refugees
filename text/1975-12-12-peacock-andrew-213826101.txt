PORTUGUESE TIMOR

The Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Hon. Andrew Peacock,  today expressed the hope that the passage of a resolution on  Portuguese Timor in the Fourth Committee of the United Nations  General Assembly would help to lead the way back to peaceful methods  of solving the problems of that territory.

Mr Peacock said that the resolution, if confirmed by the  General Assembly itself, would open the way for consideration of  the question of Timor in the Security Council, which had been  marking time pending the outcome of discussion in the Assembly.

Mr Peacock noted that the Fourth Committee had approved  the resolution yesterday by a vote of 69 states,  (including  Australia) in favour, 11 states (including Indonesia) against, with  38 abstentions, .

Australia had supported the resolution because ,  it had  a number of positive features,  which had been absorbed from an  earlier draft resolution that the Australian delegation had  co-sponsored and which retained their force and validity.

Foremost among those positive features was an appeal  to the parties in Portuguese Timor to join in talks to end the  strife in the territory and lead towards the orderly exercise  of the right of self-determination by the Timorese people.

The resolution also called upon Indonesia to withdraw  its armed forces,  urgedthe right for the people of Portuguese Timor  freely to exercise their right to self-determination and independÂ­ ence, and requested the Special Committee of 24 on Decolonisation  to send a fact-finding mission to the territory as soon as possible.

Mr Peacock said that he understood the reasons why  Indonesia had opposed the resolution. To some extent Australia  shared those misgivings. Ã¢ÂÂ

"Not least we understand Indonesia's view that it is  necessary to have peace and order in the territory to facilitate  the expression of the views of the people of Timor of their own  wishes for the future. Nevertheless we cannot agree that.the  use of force is an appropriate means of settling the problem of

Portuguese Timor," he said.

The spotlight would now turn to the Security Council.  The Council,  as the United Nations body charged with primary  responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and  security,  would have an important responsibility to work for  a resumption of the process of peaceful and agreed decolonisation

in Portuguese Timor. For this purpose the active co-operation  of all parties to the dispute,  and of all members of the Council,  would be necessary.

Mr Peacock recalled that Australia, although not a  member of the Council, would be seeking the right to take part  in the debate there.

The delegation's instructions would be to continue the  efforts it had been pressing in the Fourth Committee to bring  about a ceasefire and a resumption of the process of peaceful  decolonisation - with appropriate United Nations involvement -

leading towards the exercise of the right of self-determination.
