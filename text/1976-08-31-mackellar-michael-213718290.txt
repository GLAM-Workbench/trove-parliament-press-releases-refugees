"I am preparedÂ·to approve their entry on

humanitarian grounds if ’they indicate they want to settle

in Australia and can meet acceptable health and character

standards," Mr MacICellar saidi .

The refugees were picked up by the Australian

oil-rig supply vessel, "Lady Cynthia", about 10 a .m . on

Saturday and taken to Singapore. Â· . Ã¢ÂÂ  Â· .

Mr MacKellar said Australian High Commission

officials in Singapore had asked the local authorities

to allow the refugees to disembark from the vessel so

thatÂ· they could be interviewed to determine whether they

wanted to come to Australia and to enable necessary

processing to be completed. .  .  .  '

There are seven men, six women and nine children

among the Vietnamese. The eldest of the children is 13

and the youngest two months. .  .

The adults include a chemical engineer, an

accountant, a bank clerk, typists and students.
