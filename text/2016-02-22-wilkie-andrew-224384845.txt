WILKIE MOVES CENSURE OF IMMIGRATION MINISTER





The Independent Member for Denison, Andrew Wilkie, today sought to censure the Minister  for Immigration and Border Protection, Peter Dutton, in the Parliament for implying that  baby Asha was deliberately harmed in order to facilitate access to Australia.

“The Minister’s comments in Question Time today were appalling,” Mr Wilkie said.

“To suggest that asylum seekers have been deliberately harming themselves or each other,  and in particular children, in order to enter Australia is outrageous.

“This is just the latest in the Government’s demonising of people who come here fleeing  asylum.

“The fact is that asylum seekers have and continue to suffer serious harm on Nauru and  Manus Island as a result of this Government’s callous, cruel and illegal irregular immigration  policies. For the Government to now blame these people for the harm that they have suffered  is nothing short of disgusting.

“It’s disappointing that Labor didn’t see fit to support my censure motion and in fact only  two other Members supported it.”
