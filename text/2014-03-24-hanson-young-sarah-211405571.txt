Australian government scours the pacific for its new gulag

The Prime Minister’s visit to Papua New Guinea has put into question the future of all those  detained at the Manus Island Detention Camp.

“The Abbott Government’s cover-up is continuing with the squashing of the PNG judge’s inquiry  into human rights on Manus Island,” said Senator Sarah Hanson-Young.

“Desperate not to be embarrassed any further the shutting down of the inquiry is an attempt to  save face by both PNG and Australia.

“It is clear that the PNG deal is dead and now the Abbott government is scrambling to find  another poor nation to dump Australia’s refugees.

“The Australian government is scouring the pacific for its new gulag.

“Australia cannot simply dump vulnerable refugees at the doorstep of some of the poorest  countries in the region.

“The Manus Island detention camp is unsafe and unsanitary. Asylum seekers should be brought  to Australia immediately for assessment and resettlement.”
