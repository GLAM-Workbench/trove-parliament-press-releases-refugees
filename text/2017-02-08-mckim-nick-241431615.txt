Media Release: Senate demands the Government come clean on US "deal"

February 8, 2017

The Government has been ordered by the Senate to produce the details of its agreement with the  United States to consider resettling some people Australia has detained on Manus Island and  Nauru.

"The government has kept this agreement hidden from view, creating unnecessary uncertainty  and anxiety for people who have already suffered far too much," Greens Immigration  spokesperson Senator Nick McKim said.

"But from what is on the public record, it is clear that it doesn’t oblige the United States to accept  a single person."

“The people Australia is indefinitely detaining on Manus Island and Nauru have been subjected  to far too much uncertainty already, which has caused massive harm to many of them."

"The Australian people have the right to know the details of the agreement, and what has been  traded away to get it done."

The Order for Production of Documents, moved by Senator McKim:

That there be laid on the table on 15 February 2017, by the Minister representing the Minister for  Immigration and Border Protection, the agreement between Australia and the United States of  America announced on the 13th November 2016 regarding the potential resettlement to the  United States of refugees on Manus Island and Nauru.
