A BALANCING ACT:

The rightful place of  defamation law in open  society





2005 Redmond Barry Lecture  State Library of Victoria  Tuesday 5 July

Morry Schwartz  Publisher, Black Inc









The  lecture  explores  questions  of  free  speech  in  application   to  the  publishing  industry.   It  examines  the  extent  to  which   Australia’s  current  defamation  laws  ‘dull  down’  the  vibrancy   of political debate in our democracy.  It discusses alternatives  to  the  current  legal  regime,  which  could  strike  a  better   balance between the interests of key actors in civil society.

‘The great privilege, then, of absolving from guilt our Judges  do not possess, but they do have the right to take the burden  of the charge off your shoulders. That is to say, when you are  acquitted in this fashion the charge is lifted from your  shoulders for the time being, but it continues to hover above  you and can, as soon as an order comes from on high, be laid  upon you again. As my connection with the Court is such a  close one, I can also tell you how in the regulations of the  Law-Court offices the distinction between definite and  ostensible acquittal is made manifest.

‘In definite acquittal the documents relating to the case are  said to be completely annulled, they simply vanish from sight,  not only the charge but also the records of the case and even  the acquittal are destroyed, everything is destroyed.

‘That’s not the case with ostensible acquittal. The documents  remain as they were, except that the affidavit is added to them  and a record of the acquittal and the grounds for granting it.  The whole dossier continues to circulate, as the regular official  routine demands, passing on to the higher Courts, being  referred to the lower ones again, and thus swinging  backwards and forwards with greater or smaller oscillations,  longer or shorter delays.

‘These peregrinations are incalculable. A detached observer  might sometimes fancy that the whole case had been  forgotten, the documents lost and the acquittal made absolute.  No one really acquainted with the Court could think such a  thing. No document is ever lost, the Court never forgets  anything.

‘One day — quite unexpectedly — some Judge will take up  the documents and look at them attentively, recognize that in  this case the charge is still valid, and order an immediate  arrest.’           Franz Kafka, The Trial

I. BOOKS, PUBLISHING AND OPEN SOCIETY





It is a great honour to be delivering this lecture in one of the world’s  great libraries.

The  State  Library  of  Victoria  was  founded  in  1854  by  a  group  of   prominent  Melbourne  citizens,  including  Sir  Redmond  Barry,  after   whom  this  lecture  was  named.  He  saw  it  as  holding  ‘the  best  of   everything’  and  becoming  ‘a  great  emporium  of  learning  and   philosophy, of literature, science and art’.

He  would  have  been  proud  and  surprised  by  the  size,  success  and   vibrancy  of  the  library  today,  with  its  almost  two  million  books  and   magazines,  and  its  huge  collection  of  Victoria’s  recorded  history  -  a   treasure  trove  of  maps,  manuscripts,  newspapers,  photographs,   videos, sound recordings, objects and more.

There  have  been  astounding  changes  in  this  library  even  since  my   matriculation  year.   As  conscientious  Melbourne  High  School  boys,   we  would  come  to  the  grand  and  silent  reading  room,  under  the   magnificent dome - to meet girls.

Today, no more index cards, it’s all high tech. The place is thoroughly  21st  Century  -  an  astounding  $190  million  has  been  invested  here   since  1990.   Whilst  there  are  people  at  screens  everywhere,  the   inspiring atmosphere created by two million books is palpable.

Anne-Marie  Schwirtlich,  CEO  &  State  Librarian,  and  her  dedicated   staff,  deserve  our  highest  praise  and  appreciation  for  the  way  they   maintain and progress this cultural treasure of ours.

I have now been a book publisher for over thirty years.  In all that time  my love of books has not diminished, nor my respect for the role that  books play in a free and open society.

Having said that, I question the value of books that do not reflect the

3

truth  because  of  some  form  of  censorship.   By  ‘censorship’  I  mean   something  wider  than  that  term  ordinarily  implies.   I  mean  any  externally  imposed  sanction  on  speech,  backed  by  the  force  of  the   state  -  including  the  law.   Whether  that  sanction  comes  before  or   after publication.

I  am  not saying  that  there  should  be  no  limitation  to  what  can  be   published  without  fear  of  legal  sanction.  Rather  I  propose  the   importance  of  asking the  question  -  Is  the  censorship  justified?  -  in  each and every case where the law, or its enforcers, attempt to curtail  free speech.

One  recent  case  in  which  I  was  personally  involved  was  last  year’s   attempt by the Federal Government to censor a book I was intending  to  publish.   The  book  was  Axis  of  Deceit  by  whistleblower  Andrew   Wilkie. A book of this nature was bound to be controversial, so we at  Black  Inc  sought  the  advice  of  a  Canberra  lawyer  with  military  and   intelligence  experience.  A  week  later,  we  received  a  fax  from  the   Attorney General’s Department informing us that the manuscript was  in  their  possession  -  our  lawyer  had  given  it  to  them  without  telling   us! In our view, this was extraordinary and unprofessional behaviour.   More on that soon.

The manuscript was circulated to the various intelligence agencies for  vetting.   A  small  delegation  of  senior  personnel  from  the  Attorney   General’s  office  and  the  Office  of  National  Assessments  came  to   Melbourne to negotiate cuts and edits.

A  small  team  of  computer  experts  was  then  sent  to  the  Black  Inc   office  to  cleanse  the  offending  material  from  our  computers.   They   transferred the data to a hard disk then gave us the option of having it  taken away or destroyed in front of us.  We chose the second option,  then  watched  them  do  it  with  a  special  little  disk-breaking  hammer.   They graciously followed up this service with a customer satisfaction  form.

There  is  no  doubt  that  Wilkie’s  manuscript  was  political  dynamite  in   an  election  year.   Our  concern  was  that  the  intense  interest  in  it  by   the Government was likely to be politically motivated.

4

This  did  not  turn  out  to  be  the  case.  I  can  absolutely  state  that  we   weren’t asked to make any changes of a political nature.  The minor  deletions  were  all  bona  fide  and  logical.   They  clearly  related  to   legitimate security issues and we agreed to them willingly.

If  that  was  the  result,  why  even  bother  asking  this  question  -  Is  the   censorship  justified?   Should  we  not  simply  trust  those  our  society   has empowered to sort out these matters  - trust them to make these  decisions  for  us?  Namely,  the  politicians  we  have  elected  to   represent us, and the law enforcement officers and bureaucrats they  instruct?

The answer to that question is an emphatic no.  That’s not because  we  are  necessarily  suspicious  of  those  who  wield  the  power  of  the   state - although that can come into it. Even where we do have basic  faith  in  the  judgment  and  probity  of  those  in  power,  there  must  be   checks and limits imposed on that power.

As  citizens,  we  need  to  be  involved  in  questions  of  freedom  and   democracy. Citizenship, like democracy, is as much about process as  it  is  about  status.  Citizenship  and  democracy  bring  rights,  but  also   responsibilities.   Citizenship  and  democracy  are  like  muscles.    Without activity, without use, they turn flabby and eventually atrophy.

The  political  philosopher  Karl  Popper  explored  similar  notions  in  his   classic work Open Society and Its Enemies. Popper criticised what he  termed ‘unmitigated authoritarianism’.  He proposed an open society  which  confronts  its  members  with  personal  and  political  decisions,   and the opportunity to reflect rationally on them. He denounced ‘the  moulding of minds and of souls’ which ‘become, by long habit, utterly  incapable of doing anything at all independently.’

Popper  was  writing  during  the  Second  World  War.   Then,  as  he   crisply put it, ‘it was not the time to mince words’.  He was writing in  the  face  of  the  two  great  and  unmitigated  authoritarianisms  of  the   twentieth century - Nazism and Stalinism.  Today, I am not speaking  so directly in their face, but am painfully cognisant of their legacy.

Lessons from that time must include the realisation that open society  is  a  question  of  degree.  We  must  remember  that  the  degree  of

5

openness  of  any  society  is  not  necessarily  fixed  across  time  -  and   that we need to work at maintaining the liberties vital to open society.  These liberties include freedom of speech.



Applying  these  lessons  to  contemporary  Australia,  we  must   acknowledge  that  we  are  mercifully  free  of  the  kind  of  state-sponsored crackdowns on political dissent that form one hallmark of  totalitarianism.1  Those  lessons  remind  us,  however,  that  the  Wilkie   case  could  have  played  out  very  differently  -  for  me,  my  staff,  my   business, the author, and of course the book itself.  In fact, it did not.

We must acknowledge this gap between possibility and reality - even  as we exercise our democratic muscle as citizens, by asking whether  this (or any other) instance of censorship is justified.

Returning  to  the  lawyer  who  sent  the  Wilkie  manuscript  to  the   Government  without  asking  or  telling  us  -  this  unexpected  sideshow   turned  out  to  be  the  insidious  face  of  the  whole  affair.  We  formally   complained  to  the  ACT  Law  Society,  alleging  this  lawyer  had   breached  his  obligations  to  us.  After  a  lengthy  process,  the  Law   Society found in the lawyer’s favour.  It concluded that:

His  obligations  of  confidentiality  were  subject  to  the  “public   welfare” exception, which permits disclosure of a confidence if  non-disclosure might jeopardize national interest …

On the available material, it was open for him to so conclude  and  it  appears  that  he  bona  fide  held  such  a  belief.  In  those   circumstances,  any  breach  of  confidence  involved  in



1  Whilst broadly accepting this, we must loudly object to serious instances of state  censorship of the media, and therefore citizens’ access to information, in recent years in  Australia.  I am referring to the government’s ‘management’ of information about asylum seekers  detained under Australian law, including via restriction of media access to these people and their  plight - not in the interests of national security as properly understood, but rather for the sake of  short-term political profit.  This use of the force of law and the state to prevent the public telling  of important truths reached an infamous low point during the Tampa and so-called ‘Children  Overboard’ affairs in 2001, and with the arrest of ABC journalist Natalie Larkins outside the  Woomera detention centre in 2002 for disobeying an instruction to move out of sight of the  compound. This last development rightly attracted the direct criticism of Reporters Without  Borders, a global media monitoring organization that campaigns for press freedom.

disclosing  the  manuscript  to  the  Attorney  General’s   Department was justified in law.

Black Inc is considering an appeal.

From  the  outset,  the  publication  of  the  Wilkie  book  posed  a  serious   challenge.  How  could  we  know  if  the  manuscript  contained   information  that  might  threaten  national  security?  We  could  not  find   one Melbourne lawyer who could advise us on this question.  So we  consulted  Dr  David  Wright-Neville,  a  Monash  academic  and  former   analyst at the Office of National Assessments (the same intelligence  agency that had employed Wilkie).

Wright-Neville read the manuscript and proposed cutting a dozen or  so  passages.   These  changes  were  acceptable  to  both  Wilkie  and   Black  Inc.  We  were  now  reasonably  confident  that  nothing  in  the   manuscript  would  threaten  national  security,  but  given  the  nature  of   the project and the fact that Australia was in a kind of state of war, we  sought  a  second  opinion.  After  many  inquiries,  we  decided  to  seek   advice from that Canberra lawyer I mentioned earlier.

Now, this is the crux of the problem. What is a publisher to do if there  is a possible breach of national security in a manuscript?  Does he go  straight to the Attorney General? This doesn’t feel right. It opens the  gates of unfettered power to Government,  diminishing  open  society.    So to whom do we go?

Clearly, now, not to some members of the legal profession, who will  pass  it  straight  on  to  Government.  There  is  a  tension  here  between   the interests of national security and robust democracy.2 There must



2  Mark Aarons gives an historical example of this tension in his correspondence to John  Birmingham’s Quarterly Essay ‘Appeasing Jakarta’ (published in Quarterly Essay 3, 2001, p 66:  ‘In 1980, Richard Walsh and the late George Munster published their extraordinary book of  leaked Foreign Affairs and Defence documents (Documents on Australian Defence and Foreign  Policy, 1968-1975).  The book included a highly revealing selection of documents dealing with  Australian policy towards Indonesia and East Timor during the government of Gough Whitlam.   Indeed, the revelations contained in this book were so embarrassing that Whitlam’s successor,  Malcolm Fraser, had it suppressed by taking legal action in the courts.  I would argue that there  was more involved in this censorship than the usual official obsession with hiding unpleasant  secrets for as long as possible (although this was a major element in the court case).’   This  measure kept ugly aspects of Australia’s East Timor policy hidden for another two decades (the

be a way to adjudicate this balance, without allowing the Government  to be both judge and jury.

There should be a clear course of action for publishers who want to  check  if  a  manuscript  raises  legitimate  security  matters.   I  urge  the   Government  -  in  conjunction  with  the  Law  Council  of  Australia  -  to   nominate  a  list  of  independent  expert  lawyers,  from  a  range  of   political  and  institutional  backgrounds.   These  lawyers  would  be   available  to  concerned  publishers  to  negotiate  with  the  intelligence   organisations and make their recommendations to the publisher.

Books  raising  questions  of  national  security,  of  course,  are  few  and   far  between.   It  is  defamation that  raises  the  biggest  censorship   issues for publishers, posing the most serious external constraint on  free  speech.  The  law  is  complex,  counter-intuitive  and  different  in   each  State  and  Territory.  In  my  many  years  of  publishing,  I  have   never fully grasped how this law works.

The  Commonwealth  Attorney  General,  Philip  Ruddock,  is  currently   negotiating  with  the  States  and  Territories  to  introduce  a  national,   uniform deformation law. I thought that this was the ideal time try to  understand  the  law  and  the  proposed  reforms.   The  invitation  to   deliver this lecture was an opportunity to try and share my newfound  understanding with fellow publishers and other interested people.

Soon  after  I  started  my  research  I  had  second  thoughts.   How  did  I   get myself into this one?  The law is a bottomless pit, and lawyers are  a  case  unto  themselves  -  as  Franz  Kafka  once  said,  ‘a  lawyer  is  a   person who writes a ten thousand word document and calls it a brief’.     I  was  in  deep  …  but  then  Dr  Natasha  Cica  came  to  the  rescue.   Natasha is a lawyer and writer visiting the Gilbert + Tobin Centre of  Public Law at the University of New South Wales, and she helped me  research and understand the issues.







Howard Government made the material publicly available after the 1999 referendum), a delay  that obscured the genesis and nature of Australia’s policy and complicity in the East Timor  tragedy.

II.  FREE SPEECH, REPUTATION AND  DEFAMATION LAW



As I have indicated, state-sponsored crackdowns on political dissent  are not a feature of daily life in Australia.  Accompanying this fact - its  bookend, if you like - is a lack of robust legal recognition of a right to  free  speech.3   This  may  be  surprising,  even  paradoxical,  given  the   centrality of free speech to theories and practice of open society, and  to the questioning that makes for muscular citizenship.

It  may  also  be  puzzling,  given  that  all  other  Western  democracies   with whom we tend to compare ourselves - including those sharing a  common law tradition like Britain, Canada, New Zealand, the US and  South  Africa;  and  those  who  don’t,  like  the  Western  nations  of   continental Europe - all have some kind of legislative or constitutional  Bill  of  Rights,  protecting  individual  liberties  including  freedom  of   speech or expression.

Australia’s  Constitution,  by  contrast,  is  largely  silent  on  questions  of   individual liberties and makes no mention of free speech.  We have  no nationally applicable Bill of Rights.4

In the early 1990s our High Court under Chief Justice Anthony Mason  did  find  and  develop  an  ‘implication  of  freedom  of  political   communication’.  This  was  embedded  in  our  written  Constitution  and



3  Although Australia has signed on to a range of international instruments protecting free  speech as a human right, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948 and the  International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights of 1966, those legal documents are not  enforceable under Australian law.

4   But see now in the Australian Capital Territory the Human Rights Act 2004 (ACT),  described as Australia’s first Bill of Rights, following the UK and New Zealand models.  The  ACT legislation includes the right to freedom of expression; see further  http://www.jcs.act.gov.au/HumanRightsAct/indexbor.html.  Also note the Victorian government  recently established a Human Rights Consultation Committee to consult the community about  whether Victoria should have a Charter of Rights; it is receiving submissions until 1 August 2005  and is due to report at the end of the year.

derived  from  the  concept  of  representative  government  which  it   enshrines.5

You  may  remember  the  Mason  Court  was  widely  criticised  for   engaging  in  so-called  ‘judicial  activism’  in  divining  this  implication.    The High Court subsequently changed leader and membership, and  has  made  clear  it  considers  the  implied  freedom  to  be  more  limited   than many commentators had initially hoped or feared.6

It has not paved the way to the kind of far ranging legal protection of  free  speech  seen,  for  example,  in  the  United  States,  where  the   Supreme  Court  has  made  it  clear  that  free  speech  is  not  limited  to   political  discussion.   But  in  the  landmark  1997  case  Lange  v.   Australian  Broadcasting  Corporation  our  High  Court  nonetheless   confirmed that the implied freedom of political communication is here  to  stay,  and  that  it  embraces  a  wide  range  of  communications  on   matters of government and politics. In that case, former New Zealand  Prime  Minister  David  Lange  sued  the  ABC  over  a  Four  Corners   episode criticizing private sector funding of the NZ Labour Party.

Lange was  also  an  important  case  because  it  rewrote  some  basic   rules  about  the  application  of  the  implied  constitutional  freedom  to   defamation  law.   That’s  why,  today,  if  you  want  to  appear  to  be  an   expert in defamation law, all you need to do is drop the word Lange  into  your  conversation.   That’s  enough,  just  Lange  -  for  example,   ‘Lange was a backward step’, or ‘Lange might be seminal, but it’s a  mess’.

The legal twists and turns of Lange and related cases are complex.  The  bottom  line  is  that  in  application  to  defamation  law,  the



5   The seminal cases were Nationwide News Pty Ltd v. Wills (1992) 177 CLR 1 and  Australian Capital Television Pty Ltd v. Commonwealth (No. 2)  (1992) 177 CLR 106, and  subsequently Theophanous v. Herald & Weekly Times Ltd (1994) 182 CLR 104, Stephens v. West  Australian Newspapers Ltd (1994) 182 CLR 211 and Cunliffe v. Commonwealth (1994) 183 CLR  272; see further George Williams, Human Rights Under the Australian Constitution, Oxford,  OUP, 1999, pp 165-183.

constitutional  freedom  of  political  communication  has  produced  no   dramatic assertion of free speech (more of that later).

The  Australian  defamation  regime  remains  overwhelmingly  pro-complainant - the odds are stacked in favour of the person seeking  restriction of speech.  In this respect, as I just indicated, we are very  far  from  the  legal  position  in  the  US,  where  their  political  and  legal   system  offers  famously  robust  protection  of  free  speech.   The  First   Amendment  to  the  US  Constitution  recognises  freedom  of  speech   and of the press. The US Supreme Court, starting with the landmark  1964 case New York Times v. Sullivan, has interpreted this freedom  expansively,  holding  that  public  criticism  of  any  ‘public  figure’  is   allowed7,  provided  only  that  it  is  not  motivated  by  actual  malice  or   reckless disregard for the truth.

Are  you  disappointed  and  still  a  little  confused  about  where  this   leaves Australians and the lawful boundaries of our speech? If so I’m  not  surprised.   Please  bear  with  me.   I  am  neither  lawyer  nor   academic.  I come to these questions as a publisher and as a citizen.

My  experience  in  the  publishing  industry,  including  the  Wilkie  saga,   tells  me  that  the  real  external  constraint  on  freedom  of  political   speech  in  this  country  is  our  defamation  laws.   It  is  these  laws  that   substantially  ‘dull  down’  the  vibrancy  of  political  debate  in  our   democracy.

That’s not just because they offer insufficient protection to freedom of  speech.  Another - and in some respects more substantial problem in  application - is the complex, confusing and counterintuitive nature of  Australian  defamation  laws.   This  means  few  if  any  writers  and   publishers  can  really  predict  when  defamation  law  might  sting  -  at   least  not  without  the  help  of  specialist  defamation  lawyers,  and  the   hefty fees that usually accompany them.  Even then, no lawyer will or  can give a definite yes or no to any proposed publication.  The most  they provide is an assessment of risk.  And no two lawyers agree in  their assessment - varying as lawyers do in boldness, creativity and

7  Protection of free speech under American law is also expanded by the concept of ‘the  vortex, where a person who is not a public figure throws him or herself into the vortex of some  massive public debate’: see ‘A life unscathed: interview with David Levine,’ 163 Gazette of Law  & Journalism, 5 May 2005, www.lawpress.com.au .

ability.

This has a dampening, some say chilling, effect on the speech of all  except  the  least  risk-averse  commentators  -  like,  say,  the  original   crikey.com’s Stephen Mayne.  Few are so fearless or foolhardy.  Only  those with the very deepest or emptiest pockets are likely to persist  with legally risky speech.

In  this  time  of  tight  profit  margins  in  my  own  industry,  the  cost  of   defamation  is  very  much  in  the  mind  of  those  assessing  book   proposals  and  manuscripts.   The  costs  range  from  legal  fees,  to   pulping  a  print  run,  to  large  damages  awards  or  settlements.    One   result is that the large publishing houses are increasingly unwilling to  deal  with  any  manuscript  that  has  any  ‘whiff’  of  a  possible  problem   with defamation.  This makes it harder than ever for provocative and  challenging books that could enliven our democratic conversations to  see the published light of day.

Although  Australia’s  defamation  laws  are  difficult  to  grasp,  they   directly  affect  what  we  can  and  can’t  hear  and  read,  and  as  a   consequence  discuss.   Therefore  it  is  incumbent  upon  us  -  as   muscular citizens, rather than people to whom things just ‘happen’ -  to make some effort to try to understand these laws.

Defamation  is  a  ‘tort’,  or  a  civil  wrong.   (It  can  also  be  a  crime,  but   criminal  defamation  is  rarely  used  -  one  example  is  the  infamous   Frank  Hardy  case  of  the  1950s).   Defamation  occurs  whenever  we   communicate something about another person that would cause any  right-thinking  members  of  society  to  think  less  of  that  person.  This   can  cover  almost  any  kind  of  statement,  including  many  that  most   people  would  dismiss  as  innocent  or  harmless  gossip,  fun  or   speculation.   The  communication  can  be  spoken  or  written.   A   defamatory  communication  -  or  publication,  as  the  law  terms  it  -  is   unlawful unless it is excused by one of the recognised defences. The  onus  always  falls  on  the  speaker,  the  publisher,  to  establish  a   defence.

In Lange,  the  High  Court  restated  the  purpose  of  the  law  of   defamation: ‘to strike a balance between the right to reputation on the

12

one hand, and freedom of speech on the other.’8  The starting point  and overwhelming weight of the law falls with reputation - as noted,  defamation  law  offers  less  than  robust  protection  of  freedom  of   speech.

Perhaps  this  reflects  the  historical  origins  of  the  action  in  England   before the Reformation.  Reputation was seen then as part of a man’s  spiritual being, and accordingly defamation proceedings were brought  in  ecclesiastical  courts.   Although  defamation  actions  subsequently   moved  to  the  common  law  courts,  the  air  of  sanctity  surrounding   reputation has clung through the centuries.

The Australian colonies, of course, inherited their laws from England.   Ss far as defamation went, some colonies followed the common law,  and  some  enacted  domestic  legislation  regulating  the  area.   This   produced a complex9 mishmash of different laws across the colonies.   The  mishmash  continued  beyond  Federation  to  the  present  day,   where  we  have  eight  relevant  legal  regimes  that  differ  significantly.    The  Commonwealth  was  not  granted  legislative  power  over   defamation  at  Federation,  which  has  impeded  movement  towards   uniform national defamation laws.10





III. LAW REFORM - RESTORING THE  BALANCE?



Uniform  laws  have  notionally  been  on  the  policy  table  for  over  a   quarter  of  a  century,  since  an  important  report  by  the  Australian   Law  Reform  Commission,  then  chaired  by  Justice  Michael  Kirby,

who now sits on the High Court.11

The  Howard  Government  has  taken  the  view  that  the

Commonwealth  has  legislative  power  to  ‘cover  the  field’,12  and  in   2004  announced  a  proposal  for  uniform  defamation  laws  across   Australia - ‘a national code in the national interest’, in the words of  Commonwealth Attorney General Philip Ruddock.

Negotiations  have  produced  two  broad  reform  models  -  one   Federal, one State/Territory - which have many common features  but  also  important  differences.13  The  Commonwealth  Attorney   General has set a deadline of 1 January 2006 for the States and  Territories  to  introduce  their  own  uniform  legislation  that   appropriately  reflects  the  Commonwealth  model,  although  he  has   promised  that  the  Commonwealth  ‘will  not  push  the  States  and   Territories  to  adopt  every  element  of  the  Commonwealth’s  draft   blueprint’.14   If  the  States  and  Territories  do  not  legislate  to  the   Commonwealth’s  satisfaction,  Federal  legislation  remains  an   option.

With respect, whatever the outcome of these political negotiations,  I  tend  to  agree  with  the  following  recent  comments  by  Richard   Ackland  at  a  Sydney  legal  forum  convened  to  discuss  the   proposed reforms:15

I have this picture of the same group sitting here again in ten  years’ time, fatter, older, greyer and more wretched. The

13    In March this year, South Australia introduced a Bill based on the State and Territory  position, which in turn draws heavily on existing New South Wales law: Defamation Bill 2005  (SA).

14  Commonwealth Attorney General’s Department, Media Release 031/2005 - States and  Territories must enact workable defamation laws, 7 March 2005.

discussion, naturally, will be about how awful is the law of  defamation.

There’ll probably be both the Ruddock Act and a semi-uniform  States and Territories law in operation. Duplication, chaos and  unhappiness will prevail. There’ll have been a few  improvements, but basically the regime still will be beset by  technicalities, uncertainties, delays, ludicrous expense and a  failure to provide a decent remedy.

Not that the lawyers will be complaining. The profession, by and  large, is the beneficiary of delays, trials, appeals, retrials and  further appeals.

…only if you were perpetrating a cruel joke could you come up  with the present law or the versions proposed at the moment …

The  proposed  reforms,  like  the  current  law  they  stand  on,  are   disappointing.  Partly because they promise too little in the way of  clarifying  the  current  law,  which  makes  it  nigh  on  impossible  for   even experienced publishers to ‘second guess’ their legal position.   And  also  because  the  reforms  promise  too  little  in  the  way  of   appropriate, balanced, protection of freedom of speech.

I will explain what I mean by looking at some key aspects of these  reforms, subjecting them to an important test:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢  In  thinking  about  any  law  that  restricts  what  may  be   published,  one  should  always  ask  the  question:  Is  the   censorship justified?

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ In answering this question, consider the interests of the third  man.

The third man is a concept advanced by West Australian academic  Michael  Gillooly,  in  his  comprehensive  work  The  Third  Man:   Reform of the Australian Defamation Defences.16  ‘The third man’

refers  to  the  public,  the  actual  and  potential  recipients  of  the   information.  Gillooly invites us to move beyond pitting protection of  reputation  against  freedom  of  speech.  For  there  is  a  silent  third   man  in  these  battles  about  what  kind  of  speech  should  enter  the   public domain. The citizens, who are the potential listeners to and  readers of publications.17

Without rehashing and no doubt distorting Gillooly’s sophisticated  analysis,18  I  will  borrow  and  modify  his  ‘third  man’  idea  in  my   following  discussion  -  to  consider  the  audience,  the  reading,   listening and thinking citizens of wider society, as the third party in  our  balancing  act.    As  key  players  -  readers,  listeners,  thinkers   and questioners - in open society.

Currently,  a  number  of  ‘points  of  difference’19 ‘remain  between   the Commonwealth and State/Territory reform models.

The  one  I’ll  mention  tonight20  is  that  the  Commonwealth  wants

17  Gillooly puts it like this, ibid, at p 6: ‘The balance to be struck is not merely between  reputation and freedom of speech.  The third vital public interest involved - that of the recipient  in receiving information and opinions on certain matters - must also be weighed up.   It may be  objected that the interest of the recipient is implicit in the concept of freedom of speech… The  short answer to that objection is that a concept labelled freedom of speech naturally and  necessarily directs attention at the speaker rather than the recipient, this freedom being seen as a  right of that individual rather than of his or her audience.’

18  Gillooly’s ‘third man’ analysis, whilst grounded in straightforward notions of ‘relevance’  and ‘quality’ of information, is pitched more at the defamation specialist than the lay reader.

20  A second point of difference the Commonwealth wants juries to be available in  defamation actions in the same way across Australia; see Commonwealth Attorney General’s  Department, Revised outline of a possible national defamation law, July 2004, p 28. Currently  juries have no role in South Australia (where civil juries have been abolished) and the ACT, and  their role varies in the other jurisdictions. The States and Territories’ model allows plaintiffs or  defendants to choose to have jury involvement, unless the court orders otherwise - but does not  restore jury involvement in South Australia. In the interests of uniformity, and therefore  simplicity, the Commonwealth approach has merit.

A third point of difference engages a ‘central tenet’ of the Commonwealth reform model - the  focus on correcting the record as the best way of vindicating reputation, rather than awarding  damages (see correspondence from NSW Attorney General Bob Debus letter to Commonwealth

corporations  to  retain  the  right  to  sue  for  defamation;  the  States   and Territories want this limited to non-profit organizations and to  small businesses (as it currently is in New South Wales).21

Examining  this  restriction  on  free  speech  supported  by  the   Commonwealth,  ask  the  question  -  Is  the  censorship  justified?  -   taking the third man into account.

My answer is yes, with an important caveat.  A large corporation, like  an  individual,  has  a  reputation  and  should  have  legal  redress  to   protect it. The problem with this is the ability of larger corporations to  silence even valid criticism, by their huge buying power (and potential  bullying  power).   Put  baldly,  big  bucks  can  buy  big  legal  guns,  and   tactics that do not always seem fair or just.22

Something  must  be  in  place  to  make  the  legal  playing  field  more   level.   That  mechanism  must,  on  the  one  hand,  avoid  incentives  for   irresponsible  speech  on  the  part  of  activists,  journalists  or  other   members of open society.  On the other, it must rein in the temptation  for corporations to bully the little people.



Attorney General Philip Ruddock, 2 May 2005, published in 164 Gazette of Law & Journalism, 6  June 2005, www.lawpress.com.au).   I agree that more emphasis should be placed in our  defamation law on correcting the record - because the third man has an interest in having access  to an accurate record.   The Commonwealth model would introduce financial incentives for a  defendant to publish an apology or a right of reply to vindicate the injury to the plaintiff’s  reputation. It also proposes court-ordered corrections where the plaintiff is successful.  The States  and Territories oppose this last idea of court ordered corrections.  So do most media  organizations, on the basis it would unduly interfere with free speech.  The States and Territories  do seem willing to entertain a middle option of giving the courts discretion to make such orders,  with the defendant forfeiting all damages if the publisher complies (see correspondence from  Commonwealth Attorney General Philip Ruddock to NSW Attorney General Bob Debus, 12 May  2005, published in 164 Gazette of Law & Journalism, 6 June 2005, www.lawpress.com.au). On  this front, I am agnostic. Both positions have merit.  Both recognize that the balancing act here is  not simply between free speech and protection of reputation - the third man has an interest in  hearing the truth, and having a corrected record available.  Both provide incentives for correcting  the record. I would support the model that in practice delivers the most accurate record, in a  timely way.

Moving beyond free speech and reputation, and given the key role of  corporate  players  in  today’s  society,  the  third  man  has  a  strong   interest in having access to a balanced public record.

So I don’t wholly endorse the Commonwealth’s position. I say, let the  big  corporations  sue  for  defamation,  but  let’s  build  a  balancing   mechanism into the law to enable the Davids to battle the Goliaths. I  suggest some version of the following:

1. The corporation - as a commercial entity - can only win a  defamation action if it can prove actual or potential financial  loss.  Damage to reputation, alone, should not be enough.

2. The onus of proof with regard to defences should be switched  from the defamer to the complaining corporation.  That is,  instead of the defamer having to make out a defence, the  complainer must show the defences do not apply.



3. If the defamer has a defensible case, and the defamer can also  establish they cannot afford appropriate legal representation,  Commonwealth-funded legal aid should be available for the  defence.



Onto  the  major  defences  to  defamation.  Once  the  plaintiff  has   establishing  a  prima  facie  case  of  defamation  -  a  remarkably  easy   task - the onus of proof is on the defendant (the publisher), who must  prove that they can rely on an available defence.

There  are  a  range  of  defences  to  a  defamation  action.  They  range   from the central to the apocryphal.  The defences of most relevance  tonight are:

1.  TRUTH,

2. FAIR COMMENT, and

3.  QUALIFIED  PRIVILEGE

18



1. First, the defence of TRUTH.



To  establish  this  defence,  the  person  accused  of  defamation  must   prove that the allegedly defamatory matter was substantially true23 -  not  just  the  statements  in  question,  but  also  the  ‘imputations’,  i.e.   meanings, that may be drawn from them.24 It is not enough that the  defendant  honestly  believed  in  the  truth  of  the  statements  or   imputations.

Currently,  truth  alone  is  a  defence  in  four  Australian  jurisdictions:   Victoria,  South  Australia,  Western  Australia  and  the  Northern   Territory.

In the remaining jurisdictions, as well as truth, the defamer must also  establish some version of ‘public benefit’.25

This  additional  requirement  protects  the  privacy  of  the  defamed   individual,  confining  publishable  matters  to  questions  of  legitimate   public concern rather than purely private matters.

The  Commonwealth  proposes  extending  a  version  of  the  public   interest  requirement  across  Australia.  The  States  and  Territories   propose  removing  it  entirely,  so  that  truth  alone  is  a  defence.   The   Commonwealth Attorney General has indicated he can ‘give ground’  on this question.26



23  In New South Wales, the ACT and Tasmania a separate defence of ‘contextual truth’ is  also available.  It gets the defendant off the hook where he cannot establish the truth of a  particular defamatory imputation, but can prove the truth of a related imputation that is at least as  damaging as the first.

24  ‘Imputation’ is a term of legal art, and a horribly confusing one that considerably  thickens the fog of war surrounding defamation.

25  In the ACT, Queensland and Tasmania, the defamer must additionally prove that  publication was for the ‘public benefit’.   Similarly, in New South Wales the defamer must  additionally prove that the imputations related to a matter of public interest.

Requiring proof of public benefit clearly restricts freedom of speech.  So again, the question to ask is - is the censorship justified? - bearing  in mind the third man.27

Given  my  support  for  freedom  of  speech  and  my  distrust  at  books   that  do  not  reflect  the  truth,  you  may  be  surprised  that  I  am   concerned  about  truthful  publications  that  violate  the  privacy  of   individuals.

Why  am  I  concerned?  The  third  man  has  no  legitimate  interest  in   allowing  the  media  to  destroy  lives  on  the  basis  of  some  purely   private  human  folly,  which  has  neither  hurt  society  nor  is  in  other   ways  a  matter  of  genuinely  public  interest,  for  the  gratuitous   entertainment of the ‘baiting crowd’.

I  am  not  saying  the  respect  for  privacy  in  this  context  should  be   absolute.  Rather, I am saying that it is not in any citizen’s interests to  be  part  of  the  prurient  mob  -  nor  even  to  observe  its  excesses  with   distaste.

So, whilst I do support the removal of a public interest requirement, I  do  propose  a  variation  to  it.   My  proposal  is  to  replace  the  public   interest  requirement  with  a  privacy  requirement.  Now,  you  could   argue that this is a distinction without difference: they are two faces of  the  same  coin.   But  by  coming  at  it  from  the  privacy  face,  in  the   manner I suggest, we change the emphasis.

My proposal is to change the onus of proof here from the defamer to  the  defamed.  So,  if  you  sued  for  defamation,  and  the  publisher  has   proved that what they published was in fact true; you would have the  opportunity to establish that the matter was properly private.28

28  Another way of arriving at this result is for Australian law to recognize privacy concerns  by enacting separate privacy legislation, as recommended by the Australian Law Reform  Commission in 1979.  Alternatively, the courts could develop a fully-fledged action for invasion  of privacy at common law.  See Commonwealth Attorney General’s Department, Revised outline  of a possible national defamation law, July 2004, p 15; citing Australian Broadcasting

2. Second, the defence of FAIR COMMENT.



This defence allows people to express opinions.  The opinion must be  based  on  true  facts.   The  opinion  must  also  be  fair  -  this  does  not   require  the  opinion  to  be  balanced  or  moderate,  but  it  must  be   rationally connected with the underlying facts.   It must also relate to a  matter of public interest.

This  defence  protects  the  published  commentary  of  opinion  writers,   political  cartoonists,  book  and  movie  reviewers,  writers  of  letters  to   the editor, and so on.

Both  the  Commonwealth  and  State  models  would  replace  this   defence with one of ‘honest opinion’.  The definition in both models is  complex.   The  State  model  appears  to  restate  the  current  common   law  position.  The  Commonwealth  model,  thankfully,  replaces  the   Commonwealth’s initial suggestion of ‘honest and reasonable opinion’  that  would  have  imposed  an  extra  ‘reasonableness’  requirement  on   commentators.   Having  said  that,  the  potential  scope  of  the   Commonwealth model in application is untested and unclear.  At least  in  New  South  Wales,  it  seems  likely  to  impose  new  fetters  on  free   speech.

We  must  ask,  Is  the  censorship  justified,  bearing  in  mind  the  third   man.29  As  a  question  of  important  principle  the  answer  is  no -  wherever   the  result  produces  greater  restraints  on  what  may  be   communicated as comment.

The reading, listening and thinking citizen has a very strong interest  in  hearing  the  fullest  range  of  provocative  opinion  on  political  and



Corporation v. Lenah Game Meats Pty Ltd (2002) CLR 199; Grosse v. Purvis [2003] WDC 151  (unreported, Skoien J, 16 June 2003); Campbell v. MGN Ltd [2004) UKHL 22 (6 May 2004.



29  c.f. Michael Gillooly, The Third Man: Reform of the Australian Defamation Defences,  Sydney, Federation Press, 2004, pp 80-86.

21

other  matters,  even  where  the  style  or  content  of  some  of  those   opinions  is  distasteful  to  many  citizens.   The  third  man  has  some   responsibility  to  desist  from  reading  or  listening  to  material  he   personally finds impossibly offensive.

This does not mean that the law has no place at all in regulating free  speech  in  application  to  strongly  expressed  opinion.  Somewhere   along  the  spectrum  of  speech  a  line  will  be  crossed  into  vilification,   incitement  to  hatred  and  so  on.   Here  legal  restrictions  will  be   appropriate in some circumstances, such as Holocaust denial.

My argument is that fewer, not more, of those restrictions should be  located within the law of defamation.





3. Third, the defence of QUALIFIED PRIVILEGE.



This defence has considerable but largely unfulfilled potential to warm  up’ debate in this country about questions of politics and government.

As a basic starting point, qualified privilege arises where the speaker  has a legal, social or moral duty to communicate defamatory material,  and  the  audience  has  a  corresponding  and  reciprocal  interest  in   receiving it (even if the speaker cannot prove the truth of the material,  provided the speaker is not acting out of malice or bad faith).

The  defence  protects  many  communications  in  a  business  or   professional context, such as a manager giving an honest reference  or  promotion-related  assessment  of  an  employee’s  capacity;  a   teacher’s assessments of a student’s performance or behaviour; and  similar  situations  involving  communications  to  and  within  special-interest groups.

Traditionally, the qualified privilege defence gave little joy to the mass  media,  including  book  publishers,  because  publishers  and  mass   audiences - the third man - were seen to lack the required reciprocal  duty and interest.

22

One  very  important  exception  to  that  rule  has  been  the  statutory    qualified  privilege  defences  in  Queensland  and  Tasmania  only.30   These allow publications made ‘in good faith in the course of, or for  the purpose of, the discussion of some subject of public interest, the  discussion  of  which  is  for  the  public  benefit.’   These  important   defences  opened  the  doors  for  publications  by  investigative   journalists  that  otherwise  would  not  have  been  legal.   An  important   example  is  Chris  Masters’  seminal  report  on  corruption  in   Queensland,  broadcast  as  ‘The  Moonlight  State’  on  ABC’s  Four  Corners in  1987.   The  Queensland  statutory  defence  was   successfully used to repel a defamation action brought by one of the  Queensland identities named in the program.31

The legal situation with respect to qualified privilege at common law  seemed to change substantially with the series of free speech cases  the High Court decided in the 1990s, involving the implied freedom of  political communication, that I referred to earlier.

In 1994 the High Court explicitly drew the constitutional implication of  freedom of political communication into the area of defamation law.  A  majority of the High Court controversially stated that the constitutional  implied  freedom  created  a  freestanding  constitutional  defence  to   defamation.

In the 1997 Lange case, however, the High Court drew back from the  precipice of that potentially revolutionary conclusion. More prudently,  it located the constitutional implication within the pre-existing defence  of qualified privilege. It extended the defence, however, to recognize  the duty and interest of all Australians  in  communicating  on  political   and government matters - which recognises the interest of the third  man  in  having  access  to  this  kind  of  information.   The  result  was   grounded  in  the  constitutional  implication  of  freedom  of  political   communication.

The outer limits of what amounts to political or government discussion



30  A statutory qualified privilege defence in New South Wales did not open similar legal  doors for publishers, as it was hobbled by a requirement that publication be ‘reasonable in the  circumstances’, which the courts have interpreted so restrictively as to emasculate the defence.

31  See Vincenzo Bellino v. Australian Broadcasting Corporation [1995] HCA 34.

23

for  the  purpose  of  qualified  privilege  are  not  yet  clear,  but  it  does   clearly embrace a wide range of political speech.

The  practical use  of  this  ‘Lange defence’,  however,  is  dramatically   reduced by a ‘reasonableness’ requirement.32

The Lange defence  requires  the  publisher  to  have  reasonable   grounds  for  believing  the  published  material  is  true;  to  take  proper   steps to verify the accuracy of the material; and to seek and publish a  response,  if  possible,  from  the  defamed  party.  In  practice,  this   renders the defence unhelpful.

Both  the  Commonwealth  and  the  State  reform  models  include  a   qualified  privilege defence,  but  subject  it  to  a  ‘reasonableness’   requirement  along  the  lines  of  the  restriction  that  emasculated   Lange.33

This  is  likely  to  leave  the  position  in  most  Australian  jurisdictions   unchanged  -  but  would  remove  the  existing  statutory  defences  in   Queensland  and  Tasmania.   In  a  nutshell,  an  expose  like  the   Moonlight State could not lawfully be broadcast.  It is astonishing that  this change has received little mainstream media attention.

So  to  our  question  -  Is  this  censorship  justified?  -  always taking  the   third man into account.34

The  answer  is  no,  in  relation  to  the  proposed  change  as  it  affects   Queensland and Tasmania. Citizens should be legally entitled to hear  more, not less, about politics and governance.

The answer is also no when we look at qualified privilege according  to Lange.35  The  simple  truth  is  that  qualified  privilege  doesn’t  help   publishers  communicate  to  the  public  in  the  way  it  could  or should.

32  Similar to the NSW statutory ‘reasonableness’ limitation.

33  And the NSW statutory defence.

34  c.f. Michael Gillooly, The Third Man: Reform of the Australian Defamation Defences,  Sydney, Federation Press, 2004, pp 149-167.

35  And, for that matter, under the emasculated NSW statutory defence.

24

The Lange restatement  of  qualified  privilege  suggests  much  but   delivers  very  little  to  the  third  man.  This  continues  to  tease,  even   titillate, imaginative lawyers with a vision of how things might be. 36



IV. WHERE TO FROM HERE?



Let me recap my wish list:

First, I  urge  the  Government  to  nominate  an  accredited  panel  of   independent  experts,  available  to  advise  publishers  who  wish  to   check if a manuscript transgresses national security issues.

Second, the Commonwealth wants all corporations to be able to sue  for  defamation,  the  States  do  not.  It  seems  clear  to  me  that  every   person  and  entity  in  society  should  have  the  right  to  defend  their   rights  against  damaging  allegations,  and  this  includes  the  huge  as   well the tiny. I have suggested one solution to the key problem of the  uneven playing field.  There may be others.

Third, in  some  parts  of  Australia,  but  not  others,  truth  alone  can   defend  a  publication.   The  States  wanted  this  to  become  the  law   throughout  Australia;  the  Commonwealth,  which  disagrees  on  this   point, seems to be prepared not to press it.  A good concession, and  if  it  holds  it  will  be  a  great  improvement  for  publishers.   To  avoid   throwing  the  baby  out  with  the  bathwater,  however,  I  recommend   replacing  the  lost  public  interest  requirement  with  a  ‘reverse-onus’   privacy limitation.





36  Commenting on recent statements by recently retired Justice David Levine of the NSW  Supreme Court, Richard Ackland observed at the Law Council of Australia’s April 2005  defamation forum: ‘… [Levine] believes that there is something in the American public figure  concept and that Lange is capable of expansion to this end.  Of course, it’s too bold, too brave, for  a government to go there, and anyway we don’t have a First Amendment.  But what Levine  suggests, sadly, is that without some sort of wider qualified privilege or public figure defence we  lose a lot of the robustness in expression that characterizes American public debate.  Again,  obviously, this is hardly something that any government necessarily wants to encourage.’

25

Fourth, the fair comment and qualified privilege defences should be  reformed  to  expand  -  not  contract  -  the  parameters  of  legal   discussion  of  politics  and  governance.   Frankly,  I  don’t  much  care   how  this  is  done  -  by  State,  Territory  or  Commonwealth  legislative   reform;  by  judges  stretching  Lange  to  the  limit  of  lawyers’  wildest   dreams;  or  by  introducing  a  national  Bill  of  Rights  with  robust  and   effective free speech provisions.  Just as long as it happens.

It’s an important time to start getting these things right, or at least a  bit more right.

Why?  As  all  these  new  screens  in  our  State  Library  indicate,  our   culture  and  economy  of  communication  is  undergoing  a  profound   revolution.  In a range of ways online is challenging print - and print-think.

I  mentioned  that  I’ve  been  a  publisher  for  many  years  now.   My   business is, fairly and squarely, in print. I understand books, I live and  breathe  them.   I  do  not,  in  all  honesty,  have  the  same  relationship   with internet publishing - at least not yet!

Some  things  are  already  clear  about  the  nature  of  that  beast,   however.   One  is  that  the  role  of  the  publisher,  the  editor,  the   gatekeeper,  is  fundamentally  different,  at  least  where  the  internet  is   operating  at  the  freest-for-all  end  of  its  spectrum  of  potential,  for   example in an unmediated blog or chat-forum, especially one where  ‘flaming’ is routine.

I am less than comfortable with this.  Not because the power of the  publisher  is  thereby  diminished,  and  the  power  of  the  citizen-speakers  ‘out  there’  in  netspace  is  heightened.   Or  perhaps  that  is   exactly why I’m uncomfortable - but only because I fear there is real  potential here for the Third Man to morph into the Third Monster.  The  internet apparently allows the hothead and the bigot to rush into print,  and  hide  behind  anonymity  of  location,  age,  gender  and  other   identity, in a way that the newspapers and books simply do not.

On a Melbourne-based blog, which was discussing an article in The  Monthly,  the  following  posting  from  ‘Templar  Wayne  from  Echuca’   was recently published:

26



Could we have an expose on blackincbooks.com?? owned by  Morry Schwarz and run by Polish and Jewish lackeys seeking  to undermine the cultural cringe whilst lining their own pockets  and publishing their mate’s mediocre books.

I should mention that this is tame compared to a lot that appears on  the  net.   But  reading  this  -  where,  for  you,  would  the  balance  lie   between free speech, reputation and the interests of the third man?

And  standing  in  my  shoes,  what  would  you  do on  reading  this?   Because  when  I  say  the  internet  ‘apparently’  allows  this  kind  of   publication, in fact - more correctly, in law - it does not.  The internet  is not a defamation free zone, as the Gutnick case37 reminded us and  as Stephen Mayne might testify.

Today’s  reformers  of  defamation  laws38  are  making  regulations  that   apply to a medium, and conversational culture, that is already faster,  looser and more open than they may appreciate.39  Will their reforms



37  Dow Jones & Company Inc v. Gutnick (2002) 210 CLR 575.  See Brian Fitzgerald, ‘Dow  Jones & Co Inc v. Gutnick: Negotiating ‘American Legal Hegemony’ in the Transnational World  of Cyberspace’ [2003] Melbourne University Law Review 21.

38  Special provisions applying to internet publication in the Commonwealth’s reform  proposal draw on the common law defence of innocent dissemination and the current policy  position in the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 (Cth): see Commonwealth Attorney General’s  Department, Revised outline of a possible national defamation law, July 2004 pp 25-6. The  reform would reinforce legal protection to ‘distributors’ of defamatory material where they did  not know the publication contained the material, and it was reasonable for them not to monitor or  check the contents of the publication for defamatory material.  This would not give any special  protection to authors, editors, or commercial publishers in respect of defamatory content  published on the net; the defence would only apply to internet service providers and internet  content hosts.

39  Despite the urgings of Geoffrey Robertson QC acting for Dow Jones, in Dow Jones &  Company Inc v. Gutnick (2002) 210 CLR 575, the High Court rejected the argument that the  internet ‘is such a new and different medium of human communication that it demands a radical  reconceptualisation’ of defamation law.  Note, however, recent comments by Justice David  Levine, upon his retirement from the NSW Supreme Court: ‘Another thing that interests me is  what effect, if any, the greater interactivity that now exists between the consumers of media and  the media itself will have.  You just go to your computer and you can talk away and comment and  answer things. Hopefully, that might produce a generation or so of what I describe about  American people as a lot more robust form of expression’: ‘A life unscathed: interview with  David Levine,’ 163 Gazette of Law & Journalism, 5 May 2005.

make  sense,  and  actually  work,  in  the  conversational  culture  of   tomorrow?

And  is  the  third  man  driving  this  change  in  the  culture  of  public   conversation,  or  just  being  dragged  along  for  the  seductive  and   irresponsible ride?



V. CONCLUSION

It  may  be  unspeakably  naÃÂ¯ve  and  arrogant  for  a  layman  to  make   recommendations  in  a  field  of  specialization  that  has  become  so   complex and arcane that only a handful of barristers and judges are  fully  across  it  in  the  whole  country.  My  prÃÂ©cis  is,  I  am  certain,  an   inexcusable distortion as it leaves out so much more than it includes.

But this is my very point.

Let us have defamation laws that are less complex and more in tune  with commonsense and intuition.

In considering what we can and can’t publish - in whatever medium  the  publishing  occurs  -  let  us  make  our  decisions  in  a  legal   framework that is more balanced, transparent and workable.



One that affirms the agency of the third man, as much as it protects  reputation and free speech.

It is not only for the sake of publishers that I call for this. Open society  depends upon and demands it. It is not only the nature of repressive  states to have complex and opaque laws - it is their central strategy  for controlling their citizens.
