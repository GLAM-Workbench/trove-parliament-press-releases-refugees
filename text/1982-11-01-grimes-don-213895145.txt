A.L.P. NATIONAL HOUSING POLICY

Our housing policy, announced jointly by Bill Hayden and  Tom Uren on 17 November 1982, has been designed to help home  buyers and renters achieve decent accommodation at a price  within their means.

.  Intending first home buyers will be assisted in bridging  the deposit gap by a grant of up.to $5,000. This will be  provided in the form of a declining subsidy over the first  four years of a mortgage, when the repayment burden is  heaviest.

w Households with total income less than $23,000 a year will  be eligible for the full grant, with partial grants  available up to $26,500.

* Institutions will be encouraged to provide a wider range of  mortgage systems to provide for varying needs and circumstance  of borrowers.

. Bank and building society interest rates will be regulated,  and more funds directed into housing to ensure an adequate  supply for intending borrowers. Such funds will be matched  to forecast housing needs in a three-year program designed

to reverse the current disastrous shortfall in new housing  starts. .

. Renters will also benefit since increased access to home  ownership will reduce pressures on the rental market, and  new home prices will be contained. '

. There will be a considerable expansion of funds for public  housing, and new measures to assist low income renters in  the private rental market.

. The Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement will be renegotiated  to provide an extra $170 million in the first year, and  further real rises in later years, for new public housing  construction and purchase of public rental accommodation. This will add an extra 5,000 dwelling units to the public

housing supply and significantly reduce waiting lists.

. A further $10 million will be provided for improving  community amenities in public housing estates, and  $15 million set aside for local government use in areas  of high housing priority. .

.  Many low income renters, however, wish to remain in the  private rental market or cannot gain access to public  housing.

To assist them, Labor will extend supplementaryÃ¢ÂÂ rental  assistance of $10 a week to adult employment beneficiaries  who have been receiving benefit for six weeks or longer  and who pay rent or lodging to private landlords.

. The assistance will be provided on the same basis as for .   pensioners - that is, at a rate of 50ÃÂ¦ for every $1 a week  paid in rent over $10 a week, up to a maximum payment of $10.

2.

.  The '  free area'  for unemployment beneficiaries will be  doubled to $20 a week.

.  Unemployed people under 18 years will be eligible for  rent assistance of up to $10 a week if they live away  from their parents' home in private rental accommodation.

. Low income families who rent privately will become eligible  for rental assistance on the.same terms as for pensioners .   and beneficiaries. The income test will be tied to that  for Family Income Supplement, so that assistance will be  .  payable at a reduced rate beyond the income limits of

eligibility for F.I.S., phasing out entirely when family  income is $20 a week above the relevant F.I.S. limit.

.. $50 million will be provided over a three-year period to  increase the supply of low cost rental accommodation  through a Community Housing Expansion Program.

. Pending an inquiry into the incidence, ..causes and effects  of homelessness and inadequate housing, Labor will  allocate an initial $5 million for a Crisis Accommodation  Assistance Fund to assist agencies in the field.

PUBLIC OPINION PROVES MINISTER WRONG

When Ian Wilson, the Minister Assisting the Minister for Social  Security, referred on 7 November 1982 to -1  the growing reluctance of taxpayers to meet what could  be called the cost of compassion*  1

he was giving a personal opinion not backed by evidence.

Research by the Parliamentary Library could uncover only two  surveys in the past two years.

.  A Gallup Poll dated 10 December 1981 found that;70% of  Australians thought not enough was being done to help  disabled people. Only 1% said the Government was doing too much.

.  An 'Age* Poll in October 1982 found that of 2,000 persons .  ; interviewed - .

(a) 71% believed that aged persons with private means  were entitled to pensions;

(b) 70% believed that the under-18 unemployed living at  home should receive unemployment benefits.

It appears that in spite of the Minister's remarks attempting  to divide taxpayers from pensioners and beneficiaries, there  is yet no taxpyers' revolt against the 'cost of compassion'.

DISADVANTAGED PERSONS HEALTH CARE CARD

When the Fraser Government made its 1981 health changes,  including  abolishing free of means test treatment in public hospitals,   it changed the criteria for establishing 'disadvantaged'  statusi  This had previously been a doctor's discretionary classification,  but from 1 September 1981 it has comprised only unemployment  and special beneficiaries, refugees and migrants in their

first six months and low income families who passed a statutory  means test.

At that time (September 1981) the Government anticipated the  demand for these 'poverty' cards was as follows:

Claimants Dependants Total

Unemployment & special  beneficiaries  Low income earners  Migrants/refugees

340.000

175.000  25,000

200,000

290,0.00  25,000

540.000

465.000  50,000

540,000 515,000 1 ,055.000

The actual figures (August 1982) are:

Unemployment & special  beneficiaries  Low income earners  Migrants/refugees

429,064 '

107,002 15,521

261,737

118,840 21,440

690,801

235,842 36,961

551,58.7 402,017 963,5 04

Though the total figures are close to the estimate,  the  unemployment and special beneficiary total is higher (and rising).   This will have raised the processing and posting costs to well  over $4 million a year ($3.08 million in April 1982). .  .

But only half of the expected low income persons - 235,842  instead of 465,000 - families and dependants are covered by  the health care. card.

Some analysis of the claimants shows that of the 107,000 .

low income earners with cards -.  21.5% were under 20 - that is, young people in jobs below  adult awards or in casual or part-time work;

.  66% were single persons - including single parents;

.  33% were married.

That is, only 32,760 'disadvantaged'  low income married couples  are covered by the health care card.  .

One can only speculate why the take-up has been only half that  estimated as eligible when the scheme was introduced. The most  likely factors are those the Labor Party raised at the time -  the stigma attaching to the card and the limited information  campaign.  The application form itself presupposed an .   average readability level about the second year of secondary

school (Senator Chaney 9.9.1981) although it is unlikely that  most eligible people will have reached that level.

4. d

The present income limits for the card are $110 a week for  a single person and $184 a week for a married couple (or single  parent and 1 child) with an additional $20 a child.

The August weekly minimum award wage for adult males was  $231-73. Families in which the sole breadwinner earns the  minimum award are eligible for the health care card only  if they have three or more children.

Mr Carlton, the Minister for Health, referred to these  income limits as 'generous1  (18.8.1982).

Senator Baume, the previous Minister for Health,  said the  income limits were set at 'relatively high levels so that  people who fail to qualify can reasonably be regarded as being  in a position to contribute towards their health care costs'.

Members of Parliament and health and welfare workers have thousands  of files on people who are just outside the income limits but  cannot afford health insurance^

The sudden cut-off point means that if a family is $1 a month  over the limit it will have to pay $60 a month to private  health funds to have cover. (If the Government had indexed,  the $20 a week for each additional child the limits would be  raised by $3.10 a week or $12.50 a month.)

Recently the National Aboriginal and Islander Health Organisation  protested to Senator Chaney about the failure of the present  system to cover Aborigines in ill health. A survey of  3,215 patients showed that 44% had ho health cover. More than

10% were not receiving social security benefits to which they  were entitled. Others who were in employment earning only  $20 to $25 above the cut-off point found it impossible to ,

belong to private funds.

The Australian Hospitals Association is on record as saying  there are more people in the disadvantaged group not insured  than was predicted. Casualty attendances at public hospitals  have fallen by 8.9% in outpatients and 14.7% in casualty  because people outside the low income limits can pay-neither  health insurance nor outpatient charges.

It is ludicrous to call this a health 'system' when -^ at least 1.5 million people are not covered by either  health cards or health insurance

. only 32,000 eligible families have a 'disadvantaged'   card

. it costs over $4 million a year to send out about  12 million cards (separate mail-outs fortnightly to  unemployment and special beneficiaries)

. administrative confusion and delays in receiving cards  are a continual problem.

The arguments for a universal health insurance scheme covering  everyone and paid for by a simple levy on income are  overwhelming.

KEEP THOSE, APPEALS COMING IN

Two out of three win invalid pensions on appeal

Invalid pension numbers continue to drop monthly as a result  of the Social Security/Health guidelines. (Not surprisingly  the Government hasn't been announcing this in its extravagant  advertising campaign.)

We reported in the September ’Social Security Bulletin'  that  there would have been over 42,000 more people on invalid pension  if the-rules had not been changed so drastically in 1980. .

Recent information given to a Senate Estimates Committee  should encourage rejected applicants or people whose pensions  have been cancelled to persevere.

In 1981-82, 5,089 invalid pension appeals (excluding those  lapsed or withdrawn) on medical grounds were finalised.

. 2,311 (45% of them) were conceded by the Department of  Social Security without ever going to the Social Security  Appeals Tribunal. .

.  1,029 (20%) of them were upheld or partly upheld by the  Department after they had been considered by the Social .  . Security Appeals Tribunal.

That is, there was a success rate of 65% - a win for two out  of every three rejected claimants. The highest success rate was in South Australia (81.5%) and the lowest in Queensland (50.6%)

Though the success rates make cheerful reading, figures on  delays are not only depressing in themselves but help to  explain why so many ill people give up.

Of 2,853 appeals considered by the Social Security Appeals .   Tribunals -.  only 108 (3.7%) were finalised in less than two months;

.  1,699 (51.6%) took more than five months; .

.  325 (11-4%) took more than a year.

At the last count 521 invalid pension appeals which had failed  at the Social Security Appeals Tribunal were before the  Administrative Appeals Tribunal.

Over 30,000 rejected claimants have not put in an appeal.  ,

Success rate of non-medical appeals

Of other non-medical appeals finalised in 1981-82 -.  42.2% of age pensioners  . 44.8% of widow pensioners  .  51.7% of supporting parent beneficiaries  . 56% of unemployment beneficiaries  .  58.3% of sickness beneficiaries  . 41.8% of special beneficiaries

won their appeals at the Social Security Appeals Tribunals,  while the Department of Social Security vetoed 200 favourable  recommendations of the S.S.A.Ts.

MOVING THE NUMBERS AROUND.

Just now. the numbers on unemployment benefit are- embarrassing  the Government, so the Department, of Social Security is  going in for. a re—shuffleÂ·Â»

In Victoria, recently a computer print-out listing the names  of 19,66-3 long-term (over 12 months) unemployment beneficiaries  was sent to 3'5 regional, offices suggesting, they might be  appropriately switched elsewhere.

But by 28.9.1982 only 1.03 (fewer than 1%) had been, placed  on some other pension or benefit.Â·

The other 19;,.650’  unemployment benef.icla-ries remained  unemployed and on the list.

STATISTICS' IN. THE MID-1980S -- MAYBE'

The Opposition has always maintained that w.hen the Government  turfed so many sick people off' the invalid pension it had a  responsibility to see that, those people were givei some other  appropriate income, support.

The Department of. Social Security has so far refus.ed to keepÂ·  figures on the numbers of rejected invalid pension claimants  who receive unemployment, sickness orÂ· special benefit.

But if we wait a few more years -"During the mid-1980s the Department is moving towards a  complete re-equipment of its. computers and computer systems  ('Stratplan')... availability of the statistical data

sought by the honourable Senator would then be reasonably  likely." (Chaney 16.11.82)

A JOB - OR ELEVEN CHILDREN?

Senator Chaney is on record as worrying about the 1  unfair and  clearly undesirable situation where an unemployment beneficiary  can be better off financially than a person in similar family  circumstances who is in employment, but earning low wages1.  (17.11.82)

He should not agonise unduly about this so-called problem. The latest average weekly minimum award rate for adplt males  is $231.73, and a family in receipt of unemployment benefit  would need to have eleven children for its unemployment benefit

payment ($238.80) to exceed this.

Senator Chaney is taking no chances. In introducing Family Income  Supplement next May he is putting the working family $79Â». 08 a week  ahead Moreover, additional benefits.for children in unemployed  families are taxable, whereas Family Income Supplement is not:

There can be no fear that an unemployed family will prosper.
