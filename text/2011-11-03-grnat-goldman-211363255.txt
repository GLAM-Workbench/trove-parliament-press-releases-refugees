E&OE……………………….…………………………………………………………………

GRANT GOLDMAN:

Good morning, Tony.

TONY ABBOTT:

Good morning, Grant.

GRANT GOLDMAN:

Interesting times. First, let’s get to Kevin Rudd. Is there a chance he could come back, do you think, because  you’ve got your nose in the right places and you’d be smelling the winds of change, perhaps?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think it’s a pretty divided and directionless government and I think there are some people who think that  Kevin Rudd would be the author of some policy changes that might help the Government. For instance,  Kevin Rudd is telling everyone who will listen that he doesn’t support mandatory pre-commitment. He’s  telling everyone who will listen that he doesn’t support the Malaysia people-swap. So, I think Kevin Rudd is  certainly agitating behind the scenes. Whether the faceless men who run the Labor Party are going to  change, who knows? Look, in the end, Grant, the big problem is this is a government which is paralysed  while it waits for the faceless men to decide who the Prime Minister should be. It’s not getting on with  tackling the problems of our country and whether it’s Julia Gillard, whether it’s Kevin Rudd, unless they  change the policies it will still be a very bad government.

GRANT GOLDMAN:

No doubt about it. Well let’s talk about the clubs industry. Look, the clubs are desperately worried about  their future, particularly the smaller ones and as you know these pre-commitment plans that have been put in  place by the Government, that’s going to see a lot of clubs fold because they can’t afford the technology that  has to be put in place to set it up in the first place. Look, responsible service of alcohol works generally at  most clubs and pubs, then why not responsible service of a gambling facility where, you know, you take it  upon yourself to walk around and see if everybody’s doing the right thing and asking them, you know, in a

man-to-man situation or man-to-woman situation saying, well, “Are you spending too much money on the  poker machines?”

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, I think that’s right. I’m not an expert in this area obviously, Grant, but the people who are say that  there are some signs that problem gamblers normally give off and I think that we should have a responsible  provision of gambling regime that is analogous to the responsible service of alcohol rules and I think that we  can do more to help the problem gambler but there’s no point doing something purporting to help the  problem gambler which is going to crush these community clubs and I think, as always, you can adopt a  smart way or a dumb way to address worthy causes and mandatory pre-commitment is a dumb way. I think  more counselling, I think voluntary pre-commitment, I think trying to ensure that the clubs take a more  personal interest in the people who are playing the machines, I think that’s a smarter way forward.

GRANT GOLDMAN:

No doubt about it. I think the major problem we’ve got in this country is internet gambling and it’s basically  the gambling problem that we’re not that aware of because it’s a pretty lonely thing…

TONY ABBOTT:

Very solitary.

GRANT GOLDMAN:

…you sit in there in your computer room throwing money away and using your credit card. See you can’t  use your credit card in a pub or club. So, yep, you can just swipe your credit card and lose thousands,  thousands online and money that’s actually going out of Australia.

TONY ABBOTT:

Exactly right, Grant. I mean, as Tim Costello the social activist has said, online gambling you can lose your  house without ever leaving home and I mean this is the tragic truth and the problem with mandatory pre-commitment is it’s likely to drive problem gamblers out of the clubs and casinos where they are at least  subject to some supervision into this dark cave of online gambling where they are very, very alone and  beyond help.

GRANT GOLDMAN:

Well my point is exactly that. If you’re trying to stop the gamblers in a pub or club with the poker machines,  a desperate gambler will find ways to lose their money. They’re the only ones who can fix the problem, with  the help of their family perhaps and even friends.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, that’s right. I mean problem gambling is ultimately a personal and family issue so it’s got to be dealt  with on that level and thinking that we can solve problem gambling by addressing the wider world, I think is  a fundamental mistake.

GRANT GOLDMAN:

No doubt about it. Look, I want to move to something else. I was shocked this morning and I’m sure this has  happened before and maybe it hasn’t been reported but more deaths now with asylum seekers and a boat off  Indonesia has gone down and what shocked me, there was a two-year-old boy that is one of the people that

have drowned. I mean, this little two-year-old will never have a life, never got past two years of age and it’s  because of a policy that’s been put in place by the Federal Labor Government, yet this mob keeps aiming up  at you. Why?

TONY ABBOTT:

Grant, I’m trying to avoid any suggestion that the Government is directly to blame for this because, you  know, ten years ago a lot of people very unfairly blamed the Howard Government when there were tragedies  at sea. Some people even believed that the Howard Government had somehow conspired not to rescue  people which was just an appalling calumny. So, I want to stay well away from that. Look, I think that the  current government genuinely wants to stop the boats. I think they’ve been very ineffective in doing it and  what’s happening in the waters off Indonesia at the moment is a tragedy, it is a tragedy. The only people  who are directly to blame for that are the people smugglers but I do think it’s important for the Government  to put strong policies in place.

GRANT GOLDMAN:

Well that’s right, a policy that’s in place can only encourage people to take advantage of our soft option in  Australia.

TONY ABBOTT:

And you know, the Prime Minister says she supports offshore processing but she’s not prepared to put her  Malaysian people-swap deal to the Parliament for a vote. So, in practise she supports onshore processing.  She says she supports offshore processing but not a single boat person has been processed offshore under  this government and if she really does want to get this Malaysian people-swap deal up she should put the  legislation into the Parliament and see how it goes.

GRANT GOLDMAN:

Look, before the last election you were banging on in your advertising about “we will stop the boats.” It was  a pretty simple statement in itself but under the Howard Government, of which you were part, of course, the  boats did stop.

TONY ABBOTT:

They did. Between 2002 and 2007 we had on average three boats a year. At some stages under this  government we’ve been getting three boats a week. Now, I think that the policies that worked in the past  should be put in place and given the chance to work again and I think they will work because it’s not just  offshore processing, important though that is. It’s offshore processing at Nauru and Manus, it’s temporary  protection visas and it’s the option of turning boats around under the supervision of the Navy where that can  effectively be done. Now, I know it’s not easy and the Howard Government copped an enormous amount of  criticism at the time but the first task of any national government is to protect the country’s borders and if  you can’t protect the borders you can’t govern the country and if you can’t govern the country you should  call an election.

GRANT GOLDMAN:

Well, sadly nothing is happening in this area. It must be very frustrating for you to watch what is exactly  going on there but thank you for your time this morning.

TONY ABBOTT:

Thanks, Grant.
