Michael Keenan MP - Federal Member for  Stirling Showdown Interview with Peter Van Onselen April 11, 2012

Topics: Labor’s Border Protection Crisis / Chinese asylum seekers en route to New Zealand

Peter Van Onselen

We are joined now out of the Perth studio by the Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and Border Protection  Spokesperson Michael Keenan. Michael thanks for your company.

Michael Keenan

It’s good to be with you again Peter.

Peter Van Onselen

We have asylum seekers, well asylum seekers of sorts I suppose, they’re not seeking asylum just yet in this country but  they are on their way to New Zealand. What’s the Opposition’s view on these certified genuine refugees and their intent at  the moment it seems to use Australia as port on the way through due to boat malfunction?

Michael Keenan

What I would certainly hope is that those particular asylum seekers do seek asylum in Australia rather than continue on  their journey to New Zealand.

Peter Van Onselen

I would have thought the Liberal Party would have rather have gotten rid of them and get them out of our shores? You’re  not going to tow the boat back are you?

Michael Keenan

No, once they have arrived here illegally the choice that they need to make at the moment is whether they seek asylum in  Australia or whether they continue on what is a dangerous journey to New Zealand. They are travelling with young  children and I understand that they are not particularly skilled sea farers and certainly I think common sense should  prevail and they should seek asylum here in Australia. Once they do that they would be processed according to our laws  and obviously they will be detained for that period whilst we process their claims. That would certainly be the sensible  thing for them to do.

Peter Van Onselen

Must be a close run in their thinking on this, assuming they are getting advice, on the one hand going back to sea, as you  mentioned with all the risks and what that entails or alternatively getting incarcerated in mandatory detention in Australia  with all the risks which we know that entails to mental health and so forth from the various reports that we have had?

Michael Keenan

I would completely reject that comparison of risks. If they continue their journey onto New Zealand then they are exposing  themselves to the most dire consequences and we have seen what can happen when a vessel on its way to Australia  sinks or runs into that sort of trouble. I don’t believe you can compare that to mandatory detention at all, which is just a  sensible safe guard that the Australian Government insists on so we can process people’s asylum claims and check their  health and security clearances.

Peter Van Onselen

What about the idea that they could just sort of hug the Australian coast. I saw one international law professor today  talking about the fact that they have the right to move through Australian waters in his view. That would mean that you  could just get an able mariner onto the boat with them and they could basically just take the scenic route around the  Australian coast but then of course the real risk is the trip across the New Zealand strait?

Michael Keenan

There is real risk in continuing on their journey and that is why I have said I hope common sense prevails and they decide  not to do that.

Peter Van Onselen

But if they do seek asylum here, is your understanding that they would essentially be guaranteed it based on what the UN  has claimed in relation to their asylum status, they are genuine refugees it would seem, so mandatory detention, despite

me making the comment about mental health ramifications that is more for people who are in it for a long time, you would  think they would only be in there for a short time given where they are coming from?

Michael Keenan

I couldn’t possibly comment on their individual case but if they do seek asylum in Australia then they will be processed in  the normal way.

Peter Van Onselen

Ok fair enough. Let’s talk about wider issues, it’s still one of the Coalition’s three prongs of policy in relation to what it  would do with asylum seekers, you have got open Nauru, you have got tow the boats back and you have got Temporary  Protection Visas. Now the towing the boats back, how is that realistically going to work Mr Keenan? We have got  Indonesia saying that they will not take them back. We have got the Navy saying that they don’t see safe circumstances  under which it can happen. How is it anything other than a glib third part of a policy when it is the first two prongs that  really matter?

Michael Keenan

I think we need to go back to what we say is going to happen when the boats are towed back. We are not talking about a  policy that doesn’t have form; this policy has been used in the past, by the Australian Government, as one of the very  important planks that we use to stop people smuggling. What would happen in this instance is the naval commander on  the spot would make a judgement about whether it was safe or appropriate to tow that boat back to where it came from  and then if that judgement was made that it was safe and appropriate to do so then they would tow it back, as has  happened in the past, to the edge of Indonesian waters.

Peter Van Onselen

It has happened in the past but only very rarely in the past and now we are in the situation where there has been so much  more realisation amongst asylum seekers that damaging the boat or causing a ruckus is something that would make it  unsafe and that is why the Navy are telling us essentially that they don’t see any circumstances under which it could be  done safely anymore?

Michael Keenan

It didn’t happen very rarely in the context of the amount of people that were coming down here illegally. The point is that  the boats had stopped to a trickle once this policy was implemented. It happened seven or eight times and of course that  was within the context of only 3 boats arriving illegally within Australia on any given year under the policies pursued by the  Howard Government. So it did happen in a substantial way if you compare it to the amount of boats that were actually  coming and it was one of the three very important planks of policy that we used to stop people smuggling, along with  Temporary Protection Visas and offshore processing on the island nation of Nauru, and that is why it represents a very  important part of our policy because we are deadly serious about stopping people smuggling.

Peter Van Onselen

But you have to agree though that what the Navy has said since you tried it last time does give a suggestion at least that it  would be less likely to be viable now than it has been in the past?

Michael Keenan

I don’t believe the conditions have changed from last time. Last time it was an important part of showing the people  smugglers that the Australian Government was deadly serious about stopping their evil trade and it remains exactly that, a  very important way that we can say to people smugglers that Australia is now closed for them to make vast sums of  money out of smuggling people illegally down here.

Peter Van Onselen

Are you entirely comfortable about the Temporary Protection Visa solution, which may or may not work, that’s contested  territory, I for what its worth agree with you that it probably would work as a deterrent but that said I am also of the view  that there is significant mental health ramifications from it and that is something that report after report has illustrated, are  you comfortable with that? Is that a couple of broken eggs to get to the omelette which is stopping the boats?

Michael Keenan

Can I say it is not contestable whether it will work or whether it doesn’t because we have tried it in the past as part of that  suite of policies and it has categorically worked. We stopped people smuggling when we pursued those three policies.

Peter Van Onselen

I agree with you on that, I’m making the point that I will accept the premise that it works lets just say that, but is it then a  price worth paying for policies like that, which works and all the deterrent value it creates, for there to be mental health  implications because that is what the experts tell us?

Michael Keenan

What Temporary Protection Visas do is they completely undercut the ability of people smugglers to sell their product which is permanent residency in Australia. That is actually in the best interest of Australia but it is also in the best interest of  people who might seek to get here illegally so I believe it is a vitally important plank. It stops people smugglers from being

able to sell their product and that is why we are going to return to it and when we do return to it as a suite of those policies  it will work to stop people smuggling and that remains in everybody’s interest.

Peter Van Onselen

You are a Western Australian MP, your electorate borders the coastline, Tony Abbott has told us that there is a virtual  invasion of asylum seekers, do you feel unsafe when going for a swim down at Scarborough?

Michael Keenan

No and that’s not the point that Tony Abbott is making. The point that he is making is that we have had over 16,000  people arrive here illegally under the Labor Party’s failed border protection policies. That is an enormous number of  people and it has cost the Australian tax payer almost $4 billion as well as the fact that Australia no longer has control  over our own immigration system. I think it’s a rather semantic point about how it is described. 16,000 people is an  enormous policy problem and that is of course the point Tony Abbott and other members of his front bench are making.

Peter Van Onselen

What about the stand off that exists at the moment between the Opposition and the Government? You want Nauru, they  want the Malaysian Solution to work. Can’t you guys just agree to come to some sort of agreement, I mean at the end of  the day isn’t some sort of action, even if it’s a compromise action between the Opposition and the Government, better  than the situation from your perspective, no action at the moment and onshore processing?

Michael Keenan

What needs to happen is that we need to come together for a solution. We are very happy to talk to the Labor Party any  time of the day or night about that but we know what will actually work to stop people smuggling so when we talk to them  we want to actually talk to them about what is going to be effective and the problem is they are clinging to failed policies  and there is no point in us just adopting another failed policy.

Peter Van Onselen

But we don’t know if the Malaysian solution is a failed policy because they haven’t had an opportunity to put it into  practice?

Michael Keenan

The problem with the Malaysian solution is it has a used by date of 800 people.  Now in the last week we had over 200  people arrive just in one week alone. Now on those figures the Malaysian policy would be capped within a month of illegal  arrivals under this Labor Government.

Peter Van Onselen

But then why not let them have it Mr Keenan, so you can basically rub their noses in it as soon as it hits 801 asylum  seekers coming here and the Government’s argument on this is that you don’t want them to have it because it may well  work?

Michael Keenan

We don’t want to pursue policies just for the sake of embarrassing the Gillard Government. We want to pursue policies  that are actually going to work and we are very happy to talk to the Labor Party about that but we know what works we  have used it in the past. These policies are not just ideas they are proven solutions to stop people smuggling and if the  Labor Party were smart or if they really wanted to address this issue, those are the policies they would adopt and we  would talk to them about that any time of the day or night.

Peter Van Onselen

Alright Mr Keenan thank you for joining us on Showdown. One final question, I have Paul Fletcher joining me up here on  the panel next, very talented Liberal backbencher, you concerned perhaps that come Government he will be on the  frontbench at the expense of the likes of yourself?

Michael Keenan

Well I would love to see Paul on the frontbench, he is a great talent and a great addition to the Liberal Party.

Peter Van Onselen

Just not at the expense of you.

Michael Keenan

Well I’m looking forward to hearing his contribution after the conclusion of this interview.

Peter Van Onselen

Alright, much appreciated. Thanks for coming on Showdown, thanks for your company.
