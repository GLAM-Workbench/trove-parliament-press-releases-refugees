SHADOW MINISTER FOR HEALTH AND MEDICARE  MEMBER FOR BALLARAT

MEDICAL TREATMENT MUST BE GUARANTEED IN OFFSHORE PROCESSING  CENTRES

The Turnbull Government cannot ignore their obligation to ensure that refugees in  Nauru and PNG continue to receive medical treatment based on the best medical  advice.

Australian doctors are rightly concerned about the lack of transparency and handling of  medical treatment at regional processing centres under the Turnbull Government.

The Department of Immigration and Border Protection has been without a Chief Medical  Officer and Surgeon General since September.

Turnbull needs to step up and ensure that someone with the right expertise and right  qualifications is appointed to the role immediately - medical decisions are too important  to be left to Departmental bureaucrats.

In line with this, the Turnbull Government must ensure that refugees remaining in PNG  following the closure of the Manus Island Regional Processing Centre have their health  and medication needs met.

The provision of health services is a basic human need, and Turnbull owes the  Australian medical community answers on these issues.
