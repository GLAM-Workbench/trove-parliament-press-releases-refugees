TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW - ABC NEWS 24 WITH LYNDAL CURTIS

SUBJECT:  BUDGET 2011; IMMIGRATION; CLIMATE CHANGE.

E  & O E - PROOF ONLY



CURTIS: Penny Wong, welcome to News 24.

WONG: Good to be with you.

CURTIS: Are you trying to dump bad news about the deficit on the Royal wedding day as  Joe Hockey alleges?

WONG: Well it was a lot of hyperbole from Joe. But if he had read the Treasurer’s speech  from, I think it’s over a week ago, the Treasurer already has spoken about the fact that we  are likely to see the higher deficits in the early years than we were predicting in the Mid  Year Review. And that’s logical given what we’re battling and given the natural disasters,  the high Australian dollar and the cautious consumer that we’re seeing.

CURTIS: Is a deficit this financial year in the upper end of the range to $40 to $50 billion,  $47 or $50 billion out of the question?

WONG: I’m not going to engage in the sort of speculation that Mr Hockey is. Obviously  those figures will be revealed on Budget night.

It is true that revenue is down. We have  been upfront about that. In fact I’ve released  figures today which show that revenue to the March quarter for the financial year is about  $6.5 billion down in terms of tax receipts. So we’ve been upfront about that. The Treasurer  has been upfront about that. We know the reasons why: natural disasters, high Australian  dollar, our patchwork economy and Australians saving much more than they used to.

CURTIS: Isn’t it the case though that some of the spending that was done under the  stimulus programs is still flowing through? You’re still spending that money?

WONG: Most of the stimulus, practically all of it, is spent. That’s just a convenient line for  Tony Abbott.

I mean the thing about Tony Abbott is this: he says he wants to come back to surplus - he  won’t say when and he won’t say how. And under his economic team - which includes no  Peter Costello; it includes Joe Hockey and Andrew Robb - we’ve seen a $10.6 billion black  hole which they haven’t explained. And I’ve put out figures which show on their own  costings, they would be in deficit in every year if they were in government.

CURTIS: But won’t you have to cut potentially unnecessarily hard to turn around a sizeable  deficit in two years just to meet what is a political target of a surplus in 2012-13?

WONG: Well I don’t accept the premise of the question. The surplus is a sound economic  target. It’s a sensible thing to do. We know - despite the fact that we’ve got some short  term softness in our economy which Australians are experiencing - we know that the  outlook over the medium term is very strong.

And we have to do the right thing and come back to surplus. It’s the way the Government  can do its bit to limit inflation; to not add to price pressures down the track.

CURTIS: Are you worried though about exacerbating the short term weakness while you’re  keeping your eye on the long term problems?

WONG: We obviously have to look at both. But I think the national interest is served by us  recognising where the economy is going, where the nation is going and preparing for that. A  surplus is part of it. So too is investment in those things which add to the economy’s  capacity like participation.

CURTIS: One of the areas where the Government wants to spend money is on a regional  processing centre for asylum seekers. But East Timor’s president Jose Ramos-Horta has  put an end to bilateral talks on the matter. Is it time to admit it’s not going to happen in East  Timor and look for other options?

WONG: I think Minister Bowen has made some comments about it already, I wouldn’t want  to add to them. This is obviously a difficult problem. It’s a difficult policy problem world wide.  And it’s a regional problem and that’s the way we are approaching it.

CURTIS: And finally Tony Abbott has said today that under his climate change policy he  can guarantee that no jobs will be lost and the competitiveness of Australian business won’t  be reduced. Is it time for you, for the Government, to put out exactly what you’re detailing  under the carbon price in order to move the debate along?

WONG: You know the only thing Tony Abbott - the only things Tony Abbott can guarantee  when it comes to climate change? That his policies will cost Australian taxpayers more and  that they will do very little, if anything, to reduce pollution. He can guarantee that pollution  will continue to rise under Tony Abbott, that’s what he can guarantee.

CURTIS: Former Finance Minister Lindsay Tanner has spoken in the last day or so and  writes in his book about the reform challenge being more difficult now because he said the  media has turned politics into a sideshow. Given those sorts of difficulties, if you accept  them, do you need to do more to inform the public, and inform the public exactly what  you’re thinking of?

WONG: We want to put the detail out there. We want to have the discussion with the  Australian people about that detail, and Greg Combet is working through the development  of that as he should.

Look, I think this is a tough reform. Dealing with climate change is a tough reform. I had the  portfolio previously and I know it was tough then and it’s got even tougher. But it’s the right  thing to do for the economy and for the future.

CURTIS: And just finally on this issue, Mr Tanner last night said that he doesn’t dispute  what’s on the public record about his opposition last year to the dumping of the emissions  trading scheme. Do you similarly have no dispute with what’s on the public record?

WONG: You know I don’t discuss what occurs internally either in the Cabinet or within the  Government but I will say this: I think this Government, under Julia Gillard, is demonstrating  its commitment to act on climate change. We know this is a tough reform, we know there is  a lot of opposition, particularly from Tony Abbott, and we’re pressing ahead and we will do.

CURTIS: Penny Wong, thank you for your time.

WONG: Good to be with you.
