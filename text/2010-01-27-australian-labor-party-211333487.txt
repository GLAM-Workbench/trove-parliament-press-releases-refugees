Haiti earthquake and Australian aid: Radio National  interview

Bob McMullan says that the delays in emergency aid to Haiti were not necessarily  unreasonable and issues with infrastructure made things difficult.

Paul Barclay:             That's a good question that you raise. Has it, in fact, been a  disaster? Perhaps our next guest can help us out on answering that one. Bob  McMullan is the Parliamentary Secretary for International Development Assistance  and somebody with a long interest and involvement in this area of foreign aid. Bob  McMullan, welcome to Australia Talks.

Bob McMullan:         Thanks very much.

Paul Barclay:           Has the way the aid has been provided, the emergency aid  been, as John from the Territory describes it, a disaster or are these entirely  understandable delays that we've witnessed?

Bob McMullan:         I think in the main it's been remarkably well-organised but I  think when it's all over we'll have to have a review and I'm sure there's some things  that could have been done better but given the scale of the problem and the impact  that had on the infrastructure, that is the airport, the port, and the roads. When the  airport's damaged, the port's closed and the roads are blocked, the efficient

distribution of anything is extremely difficult and when it's a place where the  infrastructure is pretty poor anyway, it makes it even more challenging. So I don't  think we can say, oh, it's been perfect and we don't have anything to learn. I'm sure  there's things we could have done better.

Paul Barclay:           Yes.

Bob McMullan:         But the caller from Alice Springs, I understand his point. There  is the body called the OCHA, the Office for Communication - for Coordination of  Humanitarian Affairs, under the UN, and it's getting stronger—a stronger and  stronger role and after the tsunami we set up the Central Emergency Response  Fund. That means there's a core of funds to be released that can be released quickly  and quite a lot was released for Haiti, so I think we are getting better at that

international coordination but he's got a point. I'm not critical of his point.

Paul Barclay:           Yes.

Bob McMullan:         But I think it—I think it hasn't been too bad.

Paul Barclay:           I think in the UK there is a coordinated central appeal in the  wake of the disaster with the funds then distributed to the various aid groups. That  obviously cuts down on bureaucracy and administrative costs. Is that a useful model  that we could look at here?

Bob McMullan:         That's really not a matter for the Government but I've actually  been talking about it with my office today and I'm interested in talking to Mark Purcell  and to some of the other agencies about whether they're interested. If they're  interested in doing it, we're interested in helping them but it's clearly—it's not  something the Government can decide.

Paul Barclay:         Sure. Maybe I should—maybe I should push it over to them for a  quick response. Mark Purcell?

Paul Barclay:         But Bob McMullan, returning to you, how much—how much is  the proportion of emergency aid of the entire overseas aid budget in Australia?

Bob McMullan:       From the Government's point of view it's relatively small  because most of the aid we spend is on long term development and I think most  people would think that's the right balance. Of course we have to have money  available to respond to humanitarian emergencies, and we do, but the overwhelming  majority of it is longer term development and that's, I think, my guess is, that's what  most Australians think is what they want their money for.

If you think about, for example, Haiti, if the development process had worked better  and there had been more—a better system of governance and things, the magnitude  of the crisis would have been less.

If you talk about humanitarian support emergencies and some of the support for  refugee programs, we provide about $300 million for that in—as part of our global  program. It's about a third of our global programs but most—but about less than 10  per cent of our overall program.

Paul Barclay:          AID/WATCH has been critical of what it describes as  boomerang aid, money that simply goes to Australian companies and organisations  and only a small amount of which makes it onto the ground to the country's that need  it. To what extent is that the case?

Bob McMullan:        Very slightly. We, of course, spend money on contractors but  we don't necessarily spend it on Australians so we have open tenders around the  world. We don't tie our aid in that manner. And it's a decision of the previous  government but they were correct to make it and we support it so we don't have tied

aid in Australia.

But when we supply technical assistance, say to Papua New Guinea, why do we do  it? Because that's what they ask us to do. We don't do anything in anybody's country  that they don't ask us to do. We don't sort of say to Papua New Guinea, this is the  aid you're going to get, we talk to them about what their priorities are and respond.

So often they approach us and say what we need is an expert to help us with X and  we fund an Australian to go and work in Port Moresby or Harare or some other  developing country to do the job that the government in question asks us to do.

Paul Barclay:           There are other criticisms, though, that too much aid money  from governments is tied to specific projects for domestic political reasons and this is  not always what the local community wants or needs.

Bob McMullan:         You mean in the domestic political interest of the countries in  question?

Paul Barclay:         Correct, yes.

Bob McMullan:         Well, we try to avoid that but we can only do in other countries  what those countries will agree to and that means in some places, like in recent  history, we've not been prepared to do anything bilateral character [sic] in Zimbabwe  because we weren't confident the money would be spent other than to support the  interests of ZANU-PF. Now, we're starting to turn that around but—and it affects  what we're prepared to do in Fiji. We haven't cut our aid program in Fiji but we've  changed its character because we're concerned about the political implications.

But these are sovereign countries. We can't do in them things those countries don't  agree to but we try not to be involved in things that are about the internal politics of a  country but…

Paul Barclay:          Just a final one, Bob McMullan, before I let you go.

The phenomenon of so-called trauma aid where the presence of aid workers and  their money in the local communities arguably has a negative impact. How much of a  problem is that?

Bob McMullan:        It has a potential where you have a massive aid appearance  compared to the size of the local economy, for example, at one point in Kabul,  because of the size of the response and the small character of the local economy,

there was a distortion but in the main it's a very—aid's a very small proportion of the  money that's spent in most countries and in most circumstances so it has a very  small economic effect.

But you can find extraordinary circumstances and I think the only recent example I  can think of is in Kabul in the immediate aftermath of the invasion of Afghanistan  where there was massive public—international aid engagement—and there needed  to be but transitionally it did cause some problems in the economy of Kabul because  it pushed up rents and wages and made it harder for local organisations to work but

in the main it doesn't have that effect.

Paul Barclay:             Very good to talk to you, Bob McMullan, and I suppose this is  an area that you hope to be spending some more time working in after the next  election.

Bob McMullan:         I absolutely will be, yes. That's for sure. Quite how, I'm not sure  yet but…

Paul Barclay:             We'll wait and see.

Bob McMullan:         …this is what I'll be doing. Thanks very much.

Paul Barclay:          We may be talking to you in another capacity in the years to  come. That's Bob McMullan who's currently the Parliamentary Secretary for the  International—for International Development Assistance.
