TRANSCRIPT OF THE LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION  HON JOHN HOWARD MP  DOORSTOP INTERVIEW 2.00 PM  PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA

Topics: Blockade o f Western Australia

E&OE: ......................................................................................................................................

Howard:

Well I just wanted to say something about tomorrow's twenty-four hour blockade o f the State o f  Western Australia. I think it is absolutely disgraceful that the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime  Minister and the Minister for Industrial Relations o f this nation are so actively and deliberately  encouraging a strike that is going to cost Australia probably $50 to $60 million o f export  income, that is going to visit inconvenience and in some cases hardship on more than a million  and a half Australians all in the name o f achieving what they see to be a short term partisan  political purpose. Whatever argument people may have with legislation this kind o f conduct is  no response. Quite rightly the strike has been condemned by the Western Australian Opposition  Leader, Mr McGinty. In the words o f the President o f the Trades and Labour Council in  Western Australia, Mr Cook, the purpose o f the strike is to inflict economic pain on Western  Australia. The Prime Minister is a co-conspirator in the infliction o f that economic pain on  Western Australia. The Prime Minister is deliberately fanning this dispute. He's deliberately  provoking the sort o f industrial action that is taking place. He has it within his power to do

something about it. He has a close association, he keeps telling us, with Bill Kelty. It is quite  plain to me and plain to West Australians that their interests are right at the bottom o f the list, so  far as this particular industrial dispute is concerned. The role o f the national leader is to heal, to  build, to reconcile, not to wreck, divide and confront, and that is what Paul Keating is doing at  the present time. It is the latest example that this man will do and say anything to remain in  power.

Journalist:

Mr Howard, there's another example of the Prime Minister's apparent close relationship with Mr  Bill Kelty related in the Sydney Morning Herald today where it's reported that a week ago, Mr  Keating attended a meeting with Solomon Lew at the house o f Lindsay Fox. Is that appropriate  behaviour for the Prime Minister?

Howard:

Well I would want to know the circumstances and I would want to know whether it was true  before I offered a comment. Talking to somebody per se is not illegal. It depends entirely on  the circumstances and what’s discussed. I’d want to know whether that story is true. I’d want to  know what was discussed before I sought to pass judgement.

Journalist:

Have you had any conversations with Mr Lew?

Howard:

Have I had any conversations with Mr Lew about the Coles-Myer matter? No.

Journalist:

Are you relaxed about M r Lew staying on the Reserve Bank Board?

Howard:

Well I think there are a number of matters arising from the whole issue that will probably be the  subject o f some discussion later today.

Journalist:

Mr Keating claims that he didn't back the strike in WA but he understands why the unions have  ta k en ...

Howard:

Well I think Mr Keating is backing and filling. Look he quacked like a duck, he walked like a  duck and he looked like a duck on the subject and he's therefore entitled to be treated as a duck  on the subject. He went over to Perth and, you know, all bare-chested and said how disgraceful  the Western Australian legislation was and he gave all the indications o f backing it. Well if Mr

Keating is prepared to now stand up and condemn the strike and ask the ACTU to call it off,  perhaps Australia's export income can be saved the loss o f $60 million. If he really didn't back  the strike .... He does, as he claims that he was misquoted, and he knows all about misquotation  o f people, then perhaps he could now stand up and say the strike ought to be called off. He  would win a lot o f points if he did that, but I bet he doesn't.

Journalist:

Is strike a legitimate tool in expressing a democratic point o f view?

Howard:

I don't believe it is ever fair to inflict on innocent people damage, hardship and suffering to  make a political point.

Journalist:

Can we expect this sort o f turmoil on a greater scale under your industrial relations policy?

Howard:

Well the turmoil is being created by the Labor Party. The turmoil is being created by the trade  union movement. The turmoil is being created by Mr Keating. I mean, he is deliberately trying  to paint the spectre o f turmoil to serve his political purposes and the Australian people should  understand that for what it is. I mean, this is base politics at it worst. He's deliberately  provoking turmoil. He's deliberately inviting pain to be inflicted on the Western Australian  public so that he can then run around and say isn't this terrible. It's all the cause o f the Liberals.

I mean, if he were a responsible leader he would be expressing his strongest disapproval, if  that's his view with the Western Australian legislation but he would be calling on the unions, he  would be calling on the ACTU for calm, for further discussion. I mean, after all, the  legislation's already been changed twice and the two most objectionable features o f the  legislation so far as the unions were concerned have in fact been taken out. But despite that,  what does the Prime Minister do: he goes to Western Australia and he absolutely fans the fires  o f the dispute with the most provocative language imaginable. I mean, this is a man who  couldn't give a damn about the interests o f the public in Western Australia, this is a man who's  just hell bent on making a political point and if ordinary Australians get trampled underfoot in

the process, he doesn't care.

ends.
