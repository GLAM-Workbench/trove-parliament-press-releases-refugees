E&OE ONLY

RAFAEL EPSTEIN:            I always feel bad that that only says gentleman when  we almost always have a female interlocutor as well. Nicola Roxon joins us from  Canberra. She is the Attorney General of course. Nicola welcome.

NICOLA ROXON:    I'll put my boxing gloves on anyway just to make it match  your introduction if you like.

RAFAEL EPSTEIN:            Thank you. Thank you. And Joe Hockey is the  Shadow Treasurer fresh from being taunted about his Bart Simpson sheets. Joe  welcome.

JOE HOCKEY:         Ohhh.

RAFAEL EPSTEIN:            It's just endless isn't it?

JOE HOCKEY:         Yeah.

RAFAEL EPSTEIN:            That's okay.

JOE HOCKEY:         Relentless.

RAFAEL EPSTEIN:            Yeah well…

JOE HOCKEY:         And I think you should change it too.

RAFAEL EPSTEIN:            Well if you let her into your bedroom that's…

JOE HOCKEY:         No, no, no this is Nicola.

RAFAEL EPSTEIN:            Oh.

[Laughter]

JOE HOCKEY:         I'm talking about having Fight Club with gentlemen.

RAFAEL EPSTEIN:            Oh look you need the customised…

NICOLA ROXON:    I was wondering how we were suddenly talking about  changing the sheets before we even started. [Laughs] We're going off track here.

RAFAEL EPSTEIN:            Okay let's just cut that conversation. It's a family  show, Nicola.

JOE HOCKEY:         It's going nowhere.

RAFAEL EPSTEIN:            Look I do want to ask you about the big issues of the  week but I am curious - I don't know, Nicola if you've been able to find out  anything. Just the storm in the States. I did ask your office if you knew if there's  anyone over there just watching the way they responded. Is there anything you  can tell us there about just learning from their response to that disaster?

NICOLA ROXON:    Oh absolutely. We've got a very close relationship with the  US - this is in my role as the Minister for Emergency Management - we do send  people to the US and they send people here when we have disasters. So I've  offered our services. At this stage, especially when the crisis is just hitting, they're  not seeking that assistance.

RAFAEL EPSTEIN:            Sure.

NICOLA ROXON:    We have for example a shared training process which is  being undertaken actually in Washington in the next month.

RAFAEL EPSTEIN:            Oh okay.

NICOLA ROXON:    And no doubt this will be a very big focus of discussion. So  there's very good relationships between our different emergency management  personnel. And I've written specifically to the Mayor Michael Bloomberg but also  the Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, who was here not that long  ago, to offer any assistance and support because this is of a scale that they've  really not seen before particularly in New York and the surrounds.

RAFAEL EPSTEIN:            Yeah.

NICOLA ROXON:    And so far, you know, people do seem to be coping very  well but obviously there has been a loss of life. There are a lot of people without  utilities. There's a lot of water in places where there's never been water before,  and they're going to have a big clean up job.

RAFAEL EPSTEIN:            And look, just a quick one to both of you. Some of the  evacuation warnings in the States were very stark and the language they used  was very different to the sorts of language that we'd used, particularly around  Black Saturday. Essentially saying if you stay there we're not going to help you.  And if you stay there think about the people who are going to have to pick up  your body if you die.

I'd like to - I'll start with you, Joe Hockey but I'll ask Nicola Roxon as well.  Do we need to be a bit more straight up and down with our warnings when we  have disasters similar to that?

JOE HOCKEY:         Well look I'm not so sure. I mean there are different  disasters in different situations. If I can declare an interest here, I have a cattle  property in the Far North Queensland and when Cyclone Yasi was going through  - and it was hit twice - by Cyclone Larry and then Cyclone Yasi.

RAFAEL EPSTEIN:            Yeah.

NICOLA ROXON:    And in the case of Cyclone Yasi there was a family that -  you know Cairns was evacuated basically. Or the warnings went out in Cairns  and the people were fearing even a tsunami hitting Cairns. A family left Cairns to  take refuge up at my place in the mountains.

RAFAEL EPSTEIN:            All right.

JOE HOCKEY:         And the cyclone hit my place in the mountains and their  house in Cairns was fine.

RAFAEL EPSTEIN:            Oh.

JOE HOCKEY:         So I mean I - you know it's a difficult issue…

RAFAEL EPSTEIN:            Sure.

JOE HOCKEY:         …when you tell people that you do have a significant - you  know, you accrue a significant moral hazard associated with that.

RAFAEL EPSTEIN:            Yeah I…

NICOLA ROXON:    I think we do need to be very clear about our warnings. I  think we are using information and technology in a way much more clearly so  that if we can identify where things are going to hit you can be much more explicit  about your warnings. And obviously that's an important part of it. But I agree,  some of them were quite confronting in that was because they were very sure  about the risk that was going to be presented here.

RAFAEL EPSTEIN:            Sure. Okay. Look I know that it's a difficult…

NICOLA ROXON:    I do think, you know - also it is different. I mean when it's  fires some people are more able…

RAFAEL EPSTEIN:            Oh yeah, yeah.

NICOLA ROXON:    …to defend their own home and others aren't.

RAFAEL EPSTEIN:            Of course.

NICOLA ROXON:    People often do, I think, over-estimate their ability.

RAFAEL EPSTEIN:            Yeah.

NICOLA ROXON:    And we don't want to put our emergency service personnel  at risk.

RAFAEL EPSTEIN:            Sure.

NICOLA ROXON:    So it's something that is constantly being updated. I am  really delighted - some of your listeners will be interested - that shortly the  location-based warning using your mobile phone rather than just your home line  or just where your mobile phone is registered so that it actually knows where you  are. And if you're in a risk area you can get a message directly to your phone.

RAFAEL EPSTEIN:            Yeah.

NICOLA ROXON:    That's coming online for Telstra in the next couple of weeks  and then Vodafone and Optus next year. And that will make a big difference as  well that people can now get direct information depending on where they  physically are, even if that's not where their home is.

RAFAEL EPSTEIN:            Yes okay. Look let's…

JOE HOCKEY:         Can I give a plug to the ABC too. Am I allowed to do that?

RAFAEL EPSTEIN:            Sure. Make it quick.

JOE HOCKEY:         Just quickly, yeah, yeah, but I'll just say the ABC had a  huge role to play during the bushfires in Victoria and we just should remind  ourselves of how valuable the ABC has been in that regard. And it's good. New  technology is adding to that...

RAFAEL EPSTEIN:            Yeah.

JOE HOCKEY:         …which Nicola just said. We welcome that.

RAFAEL EPSTEIN:            Thank you.

NICOLA ROXON:    That's great because if the Shadow Treasury becomes the  Treasury we won't cut the ABC after all of that good work that they do.

RAFAEL EPSTEIN:            Oh no no no let's - I thought that but I didn't want to  say it. So look let's - we will get onto the budget in a moment. What I would like to  play for both of you is a grab from Petro Georgiou. The reason we're playing it is  that the Government under Julia Gillard - and I think I'm right in saying Chris

Bowen introduced this legislation into the house today - effectively going to make  it that if you make landfall in a boat anywhere on the Australian mainland you  won't be able to apply for asylum directly, you'd need to go to a place like Nauru  and PNG, wait there to have your claim being processed.

The reason John Howard's government couldn't pass that is that the  Labor party opposed that when they were in opposition, and also people like  Petro Georgiou, who was the backbencher member for Kooyong, he opposed  that move.

We had a word to Petro Georgiou yesterday, and this is what he said  when I asked him what he thought of Labor doing something they opposed in  opposition.

[Start of excerpt]

PETRO GEORGIOU:           How could they do this after all the things that they  said in 2006 about what a disgraceful and unacceptable measure this would be?  I do not believe, and I keep on coming back to the point, that we shouldn't be  further punishing people who come under our protection and who are escaping  from persecution. It is a race for populous votes responding to a fear of refugees.

[End of excerpt]

RAFAEL EPSTEIN:            So it's all about a fear of refugees. Nicola Roxon  there's any of quotes of your side of politics opposing this when John Howard  proposed it. Isn't it just rank political hypocrisy to then introduce it?

NICOLA ROXON:    No. But we've been very public that we have changed our  position on this. We've been very public about watching the trends that are  unfolding. We're dealing with a big upswing of people coming from Sri Lanka that  hadn't been coming before, including, not just Tamils - that I think a lot of people,  you know, are concerned of being persecuted - but also the Sinhalese.

I think that this - we need to be in a position where we can very clearly  say that the refugee convention is not the way that people can come to Australia  just because they think they can have a better life or better economic  opportunities. It's actually there and designed to protect those that are fleeing  persecution.

So we do have to be very careful that Australia is sending a clear  message and, particularly because we don't want more lives lost at sea, that you  don't get some sort of advantage if you can get on a boat, risking all sorts of life  and limb, and make it to the mainland.

And we did make very strong comments. I was in the parliament at that  time when the Howard Government was doing this. And we've said that we would  accept our expert panel report. It had a lot of things in it that were difficult for us

to accept and would be difficult for the Liberal party to accept, as in it picked  pieces of policies that came from different parties. And we've said we'll  implement it in full and that's now what we're doing. Even although of course if  you look at our history over a period of time that would look inconsistent.

You know you can't stay in politics and never change your mind if your  advice and recommendations to you change.

RAFAEL EPSTEIN:            Is that saying that a significant proportion of the  people who seek asylum are actually economic refugees and you want to deter  them?

NICOLA ROXON:    Well we absolutely want to make clear that we don't believe  that you can use the refugee convention…

RAFAEL EPSTEIN:            Yeah, no I understand that.

NICOLA ROXON:    …unless you're a refugee.

RAFAEL EPSTEIN:            I guess the query is, of the people who have applied  in the past do you think a significant proportion of them weren't genuine asylum  seekers?

NICOLA ROXON:    No. I'm saying that the trends are changing over time and  we want to make sure that people - you know, our biggest message is don't get  on a boat. If you're a genuine refugee and you wait in the country that you're in  we're now agreeing to accept more refugees - now up to 20,000 - you will get  processed more quickly if you actually do that in the country that you're in rather  than risking life and limb on a boat and also potentially moving ahead of others  who have been patiently waiting…

RAFAEL EPSTEIN:            Sure.

NICOLA ROXON:    Whether it's in Africa or the Thai Burmese border…

RAFAEL EPSTEIN:            Okay.

NICOLA ROXON:    …or in Malaysia or Indonesia.

RAFAEL EPSTEIN:            Joe Hockey are you going to support this? The  Government says it's almost identical to the plan proposed by John Howard.

JOE HOCKEY:         Well we're not going to oppose it, but we do wish the  Government would follow through with the other key elements of our policy which  did work.

I mean obviously we were going to do this. In the end we didn't have to  because we stopped by the boats by having temporary protection visas. Turning  back the boats where appropriate and obviously having processing of  applications in Nauru.

But the boats keep coming. Seventeen boats have come in the last seven  days. Forty one boats this month. Each boat costing Australian tax payers nearly  $13 million in costs. It's just an unbelievable story.

And the hypocrisy is rich from the Government. I mean Chris Bowen  called it a stain on our national character and now he wants to do it. Anthony  Albanese called it a bill that reduces the parliament and nation and now he wants  to do it. Tony Burke, he said it undermines our sovereignty, it offends our  decency, it mocks the parliament. He wants it.

Simon Crean said it was shameful and xenophobic. Now he wants it. I  mean…

NICOLA ROXON:    But I guess - I mean I guess the point though that this  makes is…

JOE HOCKEY:         Well it would…

NICOLA ROXON:    …is that I mean yes we've made those strong comments…

JOE HOCKEY:         [Indistinct] There - what is rich is they're about the  substance of our heart. You know they're about - when you're accusing someone  of being xenophobic and reducing the status of the nation to nothing with your  intent, which is the allegations that were made those years ago, and now the  Government says policies have changed, that intent is okay.

RAFAEL EPSTEIN:            He's got a point doesn't he, Nicola Roxon?

JOE HOCKEY:         You know it's intent.

RAFAEL EPSTEIN:            They're heavy accusations.

JOE HOCKEY:         They're heavy. They're…

NICOLA ROXON:    Oh but they are, and I mean I guess what you could also  ask and we do ask in fact because it's been difficult for many of us to change our  position in looking for what will actually be an effective deterrent in the new  environment, and being prepared to take the advice of others even if it means a  change of position. We're asking the Liberal Party to consider doing that as well  with respect to our plans in Malaysia. And if you look at Joe's..

JOE HOCKEY:         Well we are.

NICOLA ROXON:    No, but I was going to say, if you look at Joe's comments  and others they were very emotive. They were also making accusations about  intent. Now look that's fine. We can have that sort of debate. But the truth is the  Government has come to the conclusion that there is no easy answer in this.  There is a comprehensive plan that got put forward by Angus Houston. We've  said we'll adopt it wholly even though it has challenges for us. We're now asking  the Liberal Party to be prepared to do that too rather than try to sort of pick it off  piece by piece.

JOE HOCKEY:         But can I just make the comment…

RAFAEL EPSTEIN:            Joe can I just - Joe I will give you a chance to  respond. I want to give people some traffic, then we'll come back to Joe Hockey.  And then I'll let listeners have their say as well. 1300222774. We'll be back with  Nicola and Joe in just one moment.

[Unrelated item]

RAFAEL EPSTEIN:            The Attorney General Nicola Roxon is with me as is  Joe Hockey the Shadow Treasurer. If you want to put a question to them yourself  you can. 1300222774. Joe you might want to pick up on Nicola Roxon's point. I  think she was essentially saying why not back the Government's other measures  and match rhetoric with action? What did you want to pick up on?

JOE HOCKEY:         Well I think what Nicola is talking about is Malaysia in  particular. And the reason why I did speak passionately against the Malaysian  deal is because I just will not cop a suggestion that children can be sent  unaccompanied to a nation like that.

Now, the difference is that I said that when we were in Government too. I  said it directly to my prime minister and, as I said in that speech in the House

about Malaysia, that was a very hard thing to do. But I would not cop it when I  was in Government as a minister and I would not cop it in Opposition as a  shadow minister or as a backbencher or anything else.

So you know, I think it is - words are powerful. Words are bullets in this  building and, you know, I just think you've got to be consistent.

RAFAEL EPSTEIN:            Okay, Nicola, have you got a quick response and  then I want to go to some texts and calls for a minute.

NICOLA ROXON:    Well, look I just think, you know, to some extent the  Government's in a position that we believe one of the key things that would make  a difference, to be a game changer is Malaysia. We think we should be trying all  options. I mean you can be as pure as you like but it's no good being pure if  you're also impotent. And we want to be able to make sure we can contain what  is becoming a serious problem.

We're being very generous increasing the refugee numbers because  there is an ability in an orderly way for us to…

RAFAEL EPSTEIN:            Yeah.

NICOLA ROXON:    …accommodate more people in Australia. But we must  send a message that risking your life at sea is not a risk worth taking.

RAFAEL EPSTEIN:            Okay. Let me read out a few text messages.

'This conversation is making me physically ill. Shame on you, Nicola and  Labor for following the Libs and losing your compassion. It's a disgrace. You've  betrayed Labor voters and lost my vote'. That's from Laura.

I'll ask both of you to comment. Well, after a caller, if you can.

And another text from Denise. 'So Howard had made the right decision  without the incredible expense of an investigation. Amazing. It seems he was a  far better PM than many gave him credit for, with the evidence being that Gillard  has adopted all of his policies'. That's from Denise.

Let's speak to Margaret in Surrey Hills. And if Joe and Nicola want to  address those texts, they can after we hear from Margaret who I cannot get on  the phone. So one moment, I will - there we go. There you are. Margaret, can  you hear me?

CALLER MARGARET:      Yes, I can.

RAFAEL EPSTEIN:            My apologies. Go ahead.

CALLER MARGARET:      I could hear you all the time but you couldn't hear me.  I'd like to ask the Attorney General how she expects a Tamil, possibly a poorish  Tamil from the regions, to get to Colombo, safely ask for an exit visa and get it?

RAFAEL EPSTEIN:            What's your point being there, Margaret? That there's  no other choice but to get on a boat?

CALLER MARGARET:      Yes, exactly.

RAFAEL EPSTEIN:            Okay. Nicola Roxon?

NICOLA ROXON:    Well, I don't accept that, and I guess the point I was also  trying to make is that we now have people arriving who are not only Tamils but  are also of Sinhalese background. There may be some people that are  persecuted for other reasons. I don't know the different grounds, perhaps  homosexuality or something else. But that people are seeing Australia -  obviously for good reasons, because we are a good strong country with a healthy  economy and lots of opportunity - as a good economic option…

CALLER MARGARET:      [Interrupts] I referred to Tamils…

NICOLA ROXON:    That is not what the refugee convention is about and we do  believe that there are other options. There are hundreds and hundreds of Tamils  being accepted in Australia in an orderly way. There are others who are being  assessed and accepted through this process.

What we're trying to do though is make sure that we don't have more  people, whether they're of Tamil background or any other, losing their life at sea  because they're paying money to - despite being very poor - often finding the  money to pay to people smugglers who are then actually putting them on boats  that are not sea-worthy, leaving them on the high seas, calling emergency  services and saying good luck with that. And we know that there are many  people who have lost their lives as a result of that. There's nothing humanitarian  about that and that's what we're trying to stop.

RAFAEL EPSTEIN:            Margaret, does that answer your question, in part?

CALLER MARGARET:      Not really, and why should they then lose their minds  on Nauru?

RAFAEL EPSTEIN:            Nicola?

NICOLA ROXON:    Well, we obviously provide support on Nauru. We believe  that this is - we need to send a very strong message. It's a tough one, Margaret. I  don't make any bones about that, but we need to be able to make clear to people  that there is not a safe way to get to Australia and that you won't get some

advantage by taking that risk. We have to make sure that people smugglers  cannot sell this as a risk worth taking because they don't have to have any - you  know, it can be all care, no responsibility. But the lives that are lost in doing that  cannot be recovered.

RAFAEL EPSTEIN:            Okay. Let's have a quick word to Tone in, who I think  is calling from Bittern, and Joe Hockey if you need to respond to what Nicola  Roxon said, you can with this response. Hi, Tone.

CALLER TONE:      Yeah, g'day. I was just - nearly fell off the seat when I heard  that it was correct in saying it was $30 million per boat?

RAFAEL EPSTEIN:            I think that might be the…

CALLER TONE:      Is that right?

RAFAEL EPSTEIN:            $13 million, I think that's if you look at the - I think it's  $1.7 billion.

CALLER TONE:      Yep.

RAFAEL EPSTEIN:            Is that from that figure, Joe Hockey, that is this is the  $1.7 billion the Government's expecting to spend in this current financial year?

JOE HOCKEY:         It's another $1.2 billion blow-out this year alone. Two  thousand people a month are coming by boat.

RAFAEL EPSTEIN:            Just a tick though. Let's just - I don't know if Tone's  got a comment or a question. Then I'll let you comment.

CALLER TONE:      That was just basically it, but I'm just trying to figure out how  is that money spent or how - where does that money go? I mean I'm a tax payer.  I've been, you know, paying taxes and lah-di-dah and all those sort of thing along  with everybody else. And I mean the justification of spending that much per boat.  I mean there isn't 13, you know, 13 million - so there isn't 13 people on each  boat. You may as well just say just stay where you are, we'll just send you the  money.

RAFAEL EPSTEIN:            Okay, Tone, look I think we get your point. Look, I'll  ask Joe Hockey first. You both - both parties essentially support offshore  processing. It's a hell of a lot more expensive to process people overseas than it  is to process them here, isn't it?

JOE HOCKEY:         Well, not necessarily. It's hugely expensive wherever it is.  And the refugee program in Australia when you increase the refugee program  here you've got resettlement costs, you've got support costs. In some cases,

refugees - you know, I mean I saw it vividly when I was minister of Centrelink.  You know, some of them have no language skills, they don't know how to use a  telephone because they've come from the poorest of the poor places on earth.  And no matter how tough you are, you've got to provide support.

RAFAEL EPSTEIN:            Okay. So it's a lot more expensive to process them  overseas?

JOE HOCKEY:         Yes, it is. No, no, of course it is. And that's - you know, that  means you've got the boat, you've got the true cost of the running…

NICOLA ROXON:    Yeah, look and I think the…

JOE HOCKEY:         Just a sec. Running the - the cost of running the, you know,  the frontline services out to pick up the boats. Then you're flying them to Nauru  and then you're processing applications on Nauru. You pay the Government in  Nauru and et cetera et cetera et cetera.

NICOLA ROXON:    But look, one of the absolutely most significant costs is the  costs of sending large ships out to rescue people who are in the high seas, who  have a boat which is no longer sea-worthy, who've made an emergency call.

RAFAEL EPSTEIN:            Yeah.

NICOLA ROXON:    Now, whatever side of the spectrum you're on in this debate,  people don't think that we should just ignore those calls. Unfortunately, we're  seeing more and more of those calls being made perhaps, in some  circumstances, taking advantage of our compassion.

RAFAEL EPSTEIN:            Yeah.

NICOLA ROXON:    It's very expensive to send…

RAFAEL EPSTEIN:            Yes.

NICOLA ROXON:    …the military out to respond.

RAFAEL EPSTEIN:            Yes.

NICOLA ROXON:    But at the same time, we don't want to leave people at risk  of dying at sea.

RAFAEL EPSTEIN:            No.

NICOLA ROXON:    So, and I think Joe's figures - I don't have in front of me the  complete breakdown. I suspect that they build in a whole range of migration  costs, not just the ones that are responding to each individual boat.

RAFAEL EPSTEIN:            I will try to - we didn't get onto budget figures. I'm  sure that issue won't go away. I promise to return to that…

JOE HOCKEY:         It won't. It won't go away.

RAFAEL EPSTEIN:            …when joined by both of you in a fortnight. Thanks to  both of you. Enjoy the rest of your time in Canberra.

NICOLA ROXON:    Thank you.

JOE HOCKEY:         See you then.

RAFAEL EPSTEIN:            Nicola Roxon and Joe Hockey there.

Ends.
