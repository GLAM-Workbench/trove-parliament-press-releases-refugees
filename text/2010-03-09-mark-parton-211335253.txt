TRANSCRIPT OF SENATOR GARY HUMPHRIES  INTERVIEW WITH MARK PARTON,  RADIO 2CC, CANBERRA

EO&E.....................................



Subjects: Asylum Seekers; Christmas Island

MARK PARTON:

We seen another two boats over the weekend, more than 100 passengers on board and  Senator Gary Humphries joins us right now from the Libs. There can’t be many beds left on  Christmas Island, Gary?

GARY HUMPHRIES:

No, indeed Mark. It is quiet likely that Christmas Island will be overflowing and what the  Government’s said its going to do in that circumstance is bring the asylum seekers to the  mainland, presumably directly. Which is perhaps is not inappropriate given that they’re  almost getting there anyway as far as these boats are concerned.

MARK PARTON:

These boats from the weekend, where were they from, do we know?

GARY HUMPHRIES:

I understand that they were Sri Lankan, at least the occupants were from Sri Lanka. They’re  probably Tamils. They of course, most likely, have come through Indonesia and that is  perhaps spent some time in Indonesia before coming to Australia but we don’t know for sure  yet.

MARK PARTON:

I thought we did this deal with the Indonesians? I thought we did this deal where we payed  them a big bucket-load of cash and they were going to fix this for us.

GARY HUMPHRIES:

I think that’s a bit of an overstatement. There was certainly a deal done with the Indonesians  with respect to the Tamils who were on board the Oceanic Viking last year, a deal was done  for them and that helped to deal with that particular issue. There was another boat load of  Tamils off the port of Merak in Indonesia, reportedly was held up at the request of Kevin  Rudd but as yet we haven’t seen what the deal is with respect to that boat. All we know is  that the boats are arriving at an unprecedented rate. This is the 20th boat to arrive illegally this

year. This is the second one over the weekend the 88th since the Rudd Government relaxed  the border protection policies of the previous Government. They’re now arriving at a faster  rate than they were in 1999 which was the highest level on record, previously.

MARK PARTON:

Gary, I’m thinking the money spent on Building the Education Revolution could have been  spent on building the asylum seeker revolution. With all these school halls going up, maybe  one of them could have been an accommodation block on Christmas Island.

GARY HUMPHRIES:

The talk is that they’re now doing an audit of the beds on Christmas Island with respect to  building even more of them. The problem is this is the ambulance at the bottom of the cliff,  they should be looking at the fence at the top of the cliff to stop this from happening. We had  a problem and we found a solution to it, the Rudd Government found a solution and they’ve  instated a problem instead. The fact is that we had dealt with this issue, we had provided a  way of making sure that they weren’t coming. We had reduced the arrivals to about 3 per  year. We’re now getting an average of something like 9 every month and it’s almost  uncontrolled. There’s nothing to stop these boats from coming across the sea.

MARK PARTON:

Is it your belief that this will be one of the battlegrounds in the Senate and in the House of  Representatives this week?

GARY HUMPHRIES:

Yes, it will certainly get lots of ventilation there. It will become a major issue this week. We  also, of course, want to know exactly what the arrangements are with Indonesia. If the  Government’s worked out some kind of deal up with respect to some or all of these boats, we  want to find out what’s going on and we need to find out exactly where it is that the  Government intends to take this particular issue. We have no indication of any solution  whatsoever at the moment. It seems to be simply, when another boat arrives ‘oh dear, best  build some more beds on Christmas Island’.

MARK PARTON:

There is a silver lining here, Gary and that is if they do manage to build more accommodation  on Christmas Island, they can certainly save on insulation. I know there’s a stack of batts  going very, very cheap.

GARY HUMPHRIES:

It would be disaster central if we did that, I think, Mark.

MARK PARTON:

There would be a lot of people available to install them as well but that’s a whole new story.  Gary, I’ll let you participate in the battleground at your place. Thanks for coming on this  morning.

GARY HUMPHRIES:

No worries, Mark.

MARK PARTON:

Gary Humphries, Liberal Senator for the ACT and Shadow Parliamentary Secretary for  Citizenship.
