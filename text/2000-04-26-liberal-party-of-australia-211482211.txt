JOURNALIST:

Good news all around today, Essendon’s on top of the ladder and this upgrade has been announced.

TREASURER:

I think it’s a very important thing for the people of Geelong, and indeed for the people of   Melbourne who commute to Geelong, this upgrade, $240 million upgrade of Geelong Road, which   means that there’ll be a three lanes each way to Werribee, and four lanes each way after that. The   Federal Government’s very pleased to declare it a Road of National Importance which means it’ll   have federal funding, and as you can see the sods are already being turned.

JOURNALIST:

The States are concerned that the illegal immigrants, which may soon get temporary visas, will be a   financial burden on them. What do you say to that?

TREASURER:

Well, the Government has set aside a very large sum of money to strengthen our border protection   over the course of the last year. We’ve been strengthening our border protection with increased   surveillance, we’ve been strengthening it with new Customs vessels, we’ve been upgrading our   detention facilities to make sure that Australians can be sure that borders are safe and are protected.

NOW there is quite a considerable cost in relation to illegals who are in detention being given   medical care and the remainder, but I can assure you that the Government, after carefully   scrutinising their claims, will ensure that the law is carried out to the full and that our border   protection and immigration policies are implemented in a very effective way.

JOURNALIST:

With due respect sir, you set these people free with $500 each, they are going to be a financial   burden for somebody.

TREASURER:

No, the Government has ensured that there are strong detention facilities, that we have more   surveillance now than we’ve ever had. People who have legitimate claims before the courts are   entitled to bring them. But within the operation of the law, the Government is actually ensuring that   its immigration programmes are faithfully and efficiently carried out.

JOURNALIST:

What do you say, why won’t the Federal Government appoint Jeff Kennett to its Wool Grower’s   Body?

TREASURER:

Well, I’m not entering into who’s putting their names forward for particular bodies. The   Government makes announcements after it carefully considers people who are best qualified for   jobs, and until public announcements are made, then all the rest is speculation.

JOURNALIST:

Back to the migrants, you’ve said that you’re running a tight law if you like, but the States are   concerned that these people will be released with temporary visas and $500, so obvioulsy they’ll   have to go on to some sort of welfare?

TREASURER:

Well, people who come into Australia as immigrants have a two year wait before they can go onto   welfare. People that claim refugee status whilst they are going through their claims are housed and   given medical care, but if the status is not granted then, as you’ve seen recently, people are sent   back to where they may have come from. And we’ve always operated a very tight control on that   refugee programme. Legitimate refugees, yes. Queue jumpers, no. People that try and jump the

queue and get their refugee claim in, by arriving in Australia illegally are dealt with in a very   efficient way under the procedures which the Government has put in place.

JOURNALIST:

If it turns out that it is costing the States a lot of money will you compensate them?

TREASURER:

Well, this is not a matter of money, it is not a matter of Federal / State rivalry. As I said, legitimate   claims for refugee status which are granted by the Government means that within the programme   you can be admitted. If you are not a legitimate refugee, if you try and jump the queue, you are   apprehended in Australia, you are put into detention, you are dealt with in accordance with law, and   we operate a very tight border control policy.

JOURNALIST:

Is the Government concerned some pharmaceutical drugs may be withdrawn from sale under the   GST?

TREASURER:

I don’t think there’s any grounds for that at all. The Federal Government operates a Pharmaceutical   Benefits Scheme which subsidises pharmaceuticals which are admitted onto that scheme. The   subsidies will continue under the new tax system, those pharmacies will be able to dispense them,   they’ll still be at the subsidised price, and consumers will be able to buy them. No grounds for   concern in relation to that whatsoever.

JOURNALIST:

Some suggestion the ACCC will get more money in the Budget to help fight the GST, people doing   the wrong thing?

TREASURER:

The ACCC is going to be well funded to ensure that it can undertake the very important work of   protecting consumers. We’ve made it entirely clear that businesses should not increase prices under   cover of GST. And anybody who believes that a business is doing that can ring the price   exploitation line, and the matter will be investigated by the Australian Competition Consumer   Commission. It’s already achieved some notable successes in relation to that. And it will be well   funded, I can assure you, to carry out all of the duties that the Government has given it under   legislation. Thanks.
