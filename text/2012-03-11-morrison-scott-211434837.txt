Interview with Scott Morrison

Australian Agenda program, 11 March 2012



Peter van Onselen:

We are joined now by the shadow immigration spokesperson, Scott Morrison.  Mr  Morrison thanks for your company.



Scott Morrison:

G' day, Peter.



Peter van Onselen:

Let's go straight to the economy if we can as a starting point.  How on earth is the  Coalition going to get back to a budget surplus after the sort of revelations that we've  seen this week from the secretary of the Treasury?



Scott Morrison:

A, that's a question for Joe Hockey not to me; but just going back to what Paul said  about the commission of audit, this is a very significant policy announcement I think  from Tony Abbott.  This is what we did back in 1996. There's nothing short of rolling up  the sleeves and getting into the sort of issues that Paul has raised and that the  Treasury secretary has raised.  I think what Tony's demonstrated is the commitment of  a Coalition government to do that. Now this week we announced three policies: we  announced the commission of audit; we announced issues in relation to defence

Australian Agenda 11 March 2012 Scott Morrison

superannuation; and we announced a policy for women at risk under the refugee  program. All three of these policies were rejected by the Government; they're sounding  a lot more like an alternative opposition than they are a government.



Paul Kelly:

If we look at this speech that Tony Abbott gave, essentially what he's talking about  here is a pretty tough approach to government spending.  Do you recognise that there  are political risks in doing that and how do you combat the government's attack on  him?



Scott Morrison:

Well there's no shortage of tough decisions that anyone who is interested in being in  politics for the next 20 years or so will have to take. I mean, I think that was the clear  message from Mr Parkinson's speech this week: we're dealing with a structural change  happening in the economy which will require structural responses over the long term.  Now that goes well out beyond the next parliamentary term, and I think that was the  sort of profound implications for what Martin Parkinson was saying this week.  This isn't  just about the next 12 months, 18 months; this is about the next 20 years.  And I think  what Tony laid out in that speech was a clear commitment that that's the space that  the next government will have to be in and the space that the current government is in  is constantly around this short-term media opportunism. It's all within the cycle which I  remember too well from NSW under Bob Carr, and as we all know now Bob Carr has  come to Canberra and so has that approach.



Matthew Franklin:

Mr Morrison, you've spoken a lot, Tony Abbott has spoken a lot about reining in  spending.  Isn't though the bottom line that to do that you'll need to cut services or  increase taxes; so which will it be?



Scott Morrison:

Australian Agenda 11 March 2012 Scott Morrison

The commission of audit I think is the key issue here for us I think to address a lost  those things in government. Already we've outlined, as we did before the last election,  a whole swag of issues where we thought we could improve the budget position. That  remains our position and those issues continue to be worked over in Opposition now  and our decisions prior to the election will be made before an election.



Matthew Franklin:

Do you think that Australian voters understand the need, as we've been discussing, for  the depth of cuts and austerity that are required and that could and probably will mean  that they will get less services?



Scott Morrison:

I think the Australian people understand a lot more than people give them credit for.  They are already dealing with the realities in their own budgets in their own  households, and they understand the decisions they are having to take. They  understand the cost of living pressures they are under. That's why they are furious  about the Government's carbon tax. That's why they're furious about other changes the  Government has made. And so I think the Australian people are doing with their own  budgets what they - what we're all talking about now obviously will have to happen  under any Government's budget but certainly would happen under a Coalition  government.



Simon Benson:

There are people in your own shadow cabinet asking the very same questions about  some of your policies at the moment, particularly paid parental leave; this is an issue  that comes up from time to time in your party room. Surely a commission of audit or an  audit commission would look at your own spending policies as well and perhaps base  some questions about those?



Scott Morrison:

Australian Agenda 11 March 2012 Scott Morrison

I think it has to be a full and frank audit and I think it will be and I know that's what  Tony has committed to.  The policy you referred to is fully funded under our program.



Peter van Onselen:

By business.



Scott Morrison:

That is the discipline that has to be imposed I think on any policy decisions of a  government going forward, and it's certainly the discipline we'd have.



Simon Benson:

But it's funded under current fiscal forecasts and clearly they're changing all the time.  You're talking about a commission of audit in two years' time, perhaps 18 months' time.   Do you think circumstances will have changed by then?



Scott Morrison:

Well who knows how much more havoc the Labor Party can wreak on the nation's  finances between now and then; probably as much as they'll wreak on our borders.  So  it is a bit of a forecasting task to work out just how wrong they get it.  I mean, within  the space of the budget to the MYEFO we saw a blowout in the budget deficit  significantly to over $30 billion.  So this is something this Government constantly gets  wrong.



Peter van Onselen:

But the Coalition is still relying on its costings from the last election when circumstances  were very different as you rightly point out.



Scott Morrison:

Australian Agenda 11 March 2012 Scott Morrison

Well these things are under constant review and they're updated internally as we get  the additional information that comes out of the Government.



Peter van Onselen:

But that updating is going to require a hell of a lot of cuts if what we're looking at in  terms of the changes is to be believed.



Scott Morrison:

Our decisions on these things will be made and announced well before the next election  and that's our commitment, and that's what Joe and Andrew and Tony will be doing.



Paul Kelly:

If we just go to your portfolio area, your pledge to turn back the boats.  This is the big  commitment given by Tony Abbott and yourself, we had an article in the 'The  Australian' yesterday by Cameron Stewart pointing out that this is just not viable, that  the Navy has deep reservations about this, that the Indonesian Government is very  concerned about this. So how do you make this policy work?



Scott Morrison:

I don't think there was anything terribly new in what Cameron said in his article  yesterday. What we know is that this policy is not a theory; it's actually a policy that  was implemented under the previous Coalition Government and it was a policy that was  implemented consistent with our international obligations and particularly the  obligations of commanders at sea. And I don't think anyone is suggesting that the now  head of Navy, when he was a commander of one of these vessels, ever acted against  his obligations as a commander of that vessel under the law of the sea. So our policy  has been implemented and proven and has worked, and we would seek to restore it on  the same basis as last time.



Paul Kelly:

Australian Agenda 11 March 2012 Scott Morrison

But this is a very difficult situation.  Is what you're saying that a Coalition government  would instruct Navy to turn back the boats even though Navy felt that this was a  dangerous exercise?



Scott Morrison:

The Coalition's policy will be the same as it was last time, Paul, exactly the same as it  was last time  and the Navy - there's one thing that I get a clear message back from  people involved in the Navy now, and that is that they will develop a plan to implement  government policy. Now no-one is suggesting anyone would have to act contrary to  their obligations under the various legal conventions and things that govern these  situations, just as it was the case last time. So it's not a theory...



Paul Kelly:

Can you explain how on earth the policy works, because we know that asylum seekers  will set fire to the vessel or sink the vessel. So how can the boats be turned around?



Scott Morrison:

All of these things were risks and presented themselves last time too, Paul.



Paul Kelly:

But how will it work next time?



Scott Morrison:

Operationally, Paul, and you would well know better than most, that these are not  things that you go into specific detail about in order not to put people in greater risk of  these situations. But the policy, as I say, is not a fantasy, unlike - I mean this isn't the  East Timor solution which was thrown about by the Prime Minister before the last  election and was exposed as the fanciful notion that it was, this is an actual policy that  was actually implemented and actually worked, and we'll will actually reintroduce it.

Australian Agenda 11 March 2012 Scott Morrison



Matthew Franklin:

You're asking people to vote for you and the policy is that you would turn back boats in  circumstances where it is safe to do so.



Scott Morrison:

That's right.



Matthew Franklin:

In what circumstances is it safe to do so? Because if the argument is that these are  risky sea-borne journeys by people who have been taken advantage of by people  smugglers surely there are no circumstances in which it's safe to do so.



Scott Morrison:

History tells a different story, Matt, because history tells the story on the last occasion  there were circumstances where it was safe to do so. Those circumstances presented  themselves and the boats were turned around under those circumstances.



Matthew Franklin:

Which circumstances?



Scott Morrison:

Admiral Griggs himself referred to a case where he was a commander of a vessel where  he turned a boat around. Now on one occasion he could, on another occasion he  couldn't. So these are historical facts.  This isn't conjecture like the Labor Party's policy,  this is history.



Australian Agenda 11 March 2012 Scott Morrison

Peter van Onselen:

Just to clarify though, it will be an operational decision.  So in other words in the Navy  determines over a one, two, three year period that they can't turn boats around there  just won't be boats turning around.



Scott Morrison:

Every vessel presents a different set of circumstances and there is a chain of command  that is followed in relation to these instances; the same process that worked last time.  No change is proposed to that.  Our policy is the same today as it was 10 years ago and  the outcome of the policy 10 years ago together with temporary protection visas,  offshore processing in Nauru, was the boats stopped. Now, even Mr Menadue agrees  that that policy stopped the boats. He may not want the boats stopped, and others may  not want the boats stopped, we do and we had the policies that worked and we're  going to restore them.   That's our commitment and everybody knows it.



Peter van Onselen:

But you'll need to do something with the Government's relationship with Indonesia to  make that happen.  If history is to repeat itself there needs to be a different attitude  from Indonesia, because it is different today than it was back then.



Scott Morrison:

This Government I think has a very poor relationship with Indonesia and I think their  attitude of the Indonesian Government in relation to particularly the live cattle trade  and what this government did to Indonesia was appalling and obviously this relationship  needs some attention, and that's something Tony made very clear earlier in the year  when he said - I mean we're going to have a Jakarta focus not a Geneva focus.  Now I  don't know where Bob Carr's focus is going to be, that's not quite clear, but we would  certainly have more of a Jakarta focus to our efforts in these areas and we would have  a very strong and robust relationship where there was a total respect for the priorities  of the Indonesian government, as we would also expect there would be a respect for  the priorities of an Abbott-led Coalition government.  I think that's the basis upon which  you can work strongly together, as we did last time when we implemented all of these  policies and they worked  and the Australian people know that. Look, we get plenty of

Australian Agenda 11 March 2012 Scott Morrison

intimidation and vilification around these issues all the time; people trying to bully us  out of our policies.  We won't be bullied out of the policies, we'll implement them, and  the people who know that better than anyone else are the people-smugglers and that's  why they don't want to see an Abbott government elected.



Paul Kelly:

What sort of incentives would you offer the Indonesian government in order to get  them on board?



Scott Morrison:

I think fundamentally, Paul, it's the nature of the relationship that exists between the  two countries, and at the moment I don't think we have the sort of robust relationship  that we would need to have in place and so we would work very quickly on that and it's  a matter of the priority we afford to that relationship and a respect for the priorities of  both of the partners, and that's what we'd do.



Simon Benson:

Let's call a spade a spade, you're talking about sending  every single boat that arrives in  Australian waters...



Scott Morrison:

No, that's not true.



Simon Benson:

You say if the circumstances...



Scott Morrison:

Australian Agenda 11 March 2012 Scott Morrison

I raise it, as you know, because there's been a lot of conjecture about this and there  have been not journalists around this table but certainly others who've misrepresented  a policy to the Indonesian government which I think was a very reckless and  irresponsible thing to.



Simon Benson:

But let me put it this way: if circumstances allowed for every single boat - assuming  that theoretically is possible - every single boat would be going back to Indonesia.   Jakarta would not accept that.  How will you convince them to take back these people?



Scott Morrison:

Again, this is not a fanciful notion, it is a proven policy that has been implemented  before successfully and we've had a very strong relationship with Indonesia over the  period of time we implemented that policy.  So I have the same confidence about our  ability to achieve this again.



Paul Kelly:

I'd like to ask you about the offshore humanitarian program because this program is  being eroded as a result of the number of boat people arriving. What is the future of  this program; is it likely to fade away?



Scott Morrison:

Not under a Coalition government.  This week we announced that 11,000 places of the  13,750, a minimum, would be reserved for the offshore humanitarian and refugee  program and within that we committed to at least 1,000 places for women at risk. Now  that's up over 200 from what the current government has. We've seen the offshore  program fall from over 12,000 under the Howard Government to less than 9,000 now.  Now that's going to fall even further, I mean this government will hand out probably  5,000 protection visas to boat arrivals this year  and 5,000 and plus more next year.   That means this program is being shrunk because we haven't been able to control our  borders.

Australian Agenda 11 March 2012 Scott Morrison



Paul Kelly:

So what will happen to the program?



Scott Morrison:

What will happen under our policy is we will ensure that the illegal boat arrivals comes  ultimately to an end, as we did last time, and that will free up the places again under  this program. We're also offering temporary protection visas to those who have come  illegally and the government's policy is to offer permanent visas. Now, we need to give  permanent visas to people in the most desperate of situations that we can help. That's  what our policies are designed to do and that's what this government's policies on our  borders have failed to do.



Peter van Onselen:

Why can't we just quarantine the offshore humanitarian program from boat arrivals and  have that as a bipartisan policy where you and Chris Bowen get together, you may not  be able to agree on Nauru or the Malaysian Solution, but why not agree on a situation  where no matter how many or how few boats arrive each year it doesn't impact on this  important scheme in humanitarian terms?



Scott Morrison:

The Government had that opportunity this week on our policy on women at risk, 1,000  minimum under the refugee and humanitarian program, and Chris Bowen dismissed it,  he rejected it out of hand.



Peter van Onselen:

Would you be open to the idea though of quarantining it all together so if there's a  thousand boat arrivals or 10,000 it doesn't matter, you take the same number of  people, including women at risk, under the humanitarian scheme?



Australian Agenda 11 March 2012 Scott Morrison

Scott Morrison:

We're not offering permanent visas to those who come by boat or those who come  illegally; we're not offering permanent visas.  So we are in a position to be able to  preserve the integrity of that refugee and humanitarian program. One of our core  motivations for having stronger border protection is to ensure the integrity of the  humanitarian program. I mean the women who are at risk are not like many that we  see come through the people smugglers, these are women who don't have the  resources to get out of a camp, these are women who don't have the mobility to get  out of a camp.  Unless they come under our program they will stay there and they will  die there and their children will die in that camp as well.



Simon Benson:

Can I ask you a question about broader migration? This week the Immigration Minister  Chris Bowen pointed out that for the first time in Australia's history Chinese migration in  this country had outstripped that from the UK. Is that something that is consistent with  the Coalition's immigration or migration policies or would you seek to recalibrate that?



Scott Morrison:

Our focus has always been on skilled migration and a non-discriminatory approach to  migration. So wherever people come from under that arrangement is really not the  issue, the issue is are they coming with skills and ability to contribute and to create jobs  and to pay taxes and to make a contribution to our country. That's the bottom line for  us. I mean, this week the Government also announced some changes to the temporary  457 program and some issues around skilled migration; we supported that. I mean, we  supported the Government on that issue because when they have a good idea -  and I  appreciate it doesn't happen that often -  we do support it. Where they have bad policy  like they've had in border protection we reject it.  Now the Government had the  opportunity to support three good policies from the Opposition this week, they rejected  all three including women at risk. I think that just shows where the Government's at in  terms of their rhetoric when it comes to working together on issues that matter.



Paul Kelly:

Australian Agenda 11 March 2012 Scott Morrison

But under a Coalition government would we see a more flexible approach to 457 visas  and would we see in fact more people coming into the country in order to meet some of  the skill shortages?



Scott Morrison:

There's no doubt that temporary migration has become a growing and more important  part of our migration program, I should say migration more broadly, net overseas  migration, was up over 300,000. What we saw happening there was that around two-thirds of that net overseas migration was actually coming from temporary migrants.  So  capital's mobile, labour is mobile; I think that's one of the defining features of the  economy going forward. Now you need to balance off those who are coming with those  who are leaving and to ensure your population impacts are managed.  But to answer  your question, Paul, we've already said that we would return to a more liberalised  arrangement for 457s, we've made that very clear.



Paul Kelly:

So how many more extra people do you think we'll see coming in?



Scott Morrison:

This is largely a demand driven program, so that's a function of how the economy  operates.  What we have also said, and this is important, is we would retain the  oversight and sanctions mechanisms for those who would abuse the 457 program.  I  think they're important reforms that came out of the Deegan review and we would  continue to support that.  But we do need to ensure that particularly when you have  significant skills shortages that can't be met from your local population then business  shouldn't have to jump through the sort of hoops that they have been under this  government, and 457s have been frustrated primarily as an industrial tactic on behalf of  the unions on 457s. While I accept and support the commonsense changes this week  from Minister Bowen, it's a little too late.



Paul Kelly:

Australian Agenda 11 March 2012 Scott Morrison

So you think that Labor's been intimidated by the trade unions in this area?



Scott Morrison:

I have no doubt they have.  Senator Evans in particular, when he was minister for  immigration, was very robust in trying to shut down this program and we saw the  results that.



Peter van Onselen:

Has the Coalition been intimidated by the trade unions in not putting workplace  relations reform back on the table?  I mean, that's a key driver to productivity and  that's one of your areas of interest.



Scott Morrison:

We've never been intimidated by the trade unions and we're not about to be.



Peter van Onselen:

Well you may not be intimidated by them but nonetheless you're intimidated by the  Australian people's reaction to WorkChoices even though business leaders are now  telling us, and no doubt telling you, that if you want to lift productivity you need  workplace relations reform.



Scott Morrison:

I think we do and Tony's made that point. We had GDP hours per work in this latest  figure in the December quarter go up by 0.4%. I think that's a welcome improvement.



Peter van Onselen:

When are we going to see serious IR reform on the table?  Tony Abbott's a former IR  minister.

Australian Agenda 11 March 2012 Scott Morrison



Scott Morrison:

Tony's has made it very clear that all of that will be made clear before the next election.



Peter van Onselen:

He better hope that the Government lasts full term because he keeps wanting an early  election but we don't have any of these examples. Shadow minister after shadow  minister tells us that we'll get all of this before the next election, Mr Abbott wants an  early election yet we're all still waiting.



Scott Morrison:

Well we don't have an early election at the moment, and if the Prime Minister will  actually respond to I think the very clear call of the Australian people for an election  then I'm sure all of this could be revealed.



Matthew Franklin:

Isn't that an issue though for the Coalition at this point in the political cycle, Labor has  settled upon its leadership for now, are you now at a point though where you have to  concede that there is not likely to be an election in the short term, likely to go full term,  and that you should start laying out a program with that in mind?



Scott Morrison:

I think we always have to be responsive I suppose to the political circumstances.  I  probably don't share your same level of enthusiasm that the Government's leadership  problems are behind them.



Matthew Franklin:

I'm not enthusiastic about it.

Australian Agenda 11 March 2012 Scott Morrison



Scott Morrison:

The Government's divisions I still think are very clear underneath the surface and I  think that will continue to play out over the year. But our policy processes have picked  up the day after the last election; our costings process the same process; our  expenditure review committee. I mean, the Coalition has continued to work hard on  policy all throughout this term.



Matthew Franklin:

But you don't want a victory by default do you?  You want to be elected on the basis of  policies that are out there and discussed and debated.



Scott Morrison:

If an election was called then obviously all of our policies would be out there, and many  of our policies are out there. As I said, we announced three policies this week, Matt,  and all three were rejected by the Government.  I think that's a pattern of the  Government's oppositionism in government and I think that's a pattern we're getting  pretty used to from this government of negativity.



Peter van Onselen:

One final question, our next guest is Professor Julian Disney, head of the press council.   The media enquiry has obviously been prominent.  There's been some criticism about  whether or not Malcolm Turnbull has been strong enough in some of his views in  relation to where the Coalition stands on this, where does the Coalition stand in relation  to the recommendations coming out of the media enquiry?



Scott Morrison:

Well you'd have to put that to Malcolm,   that's obviously his area of responsibility.



Australian Agenda 11 March 2012 Scott Morrison

Peter van Onselen:

What's your view though, what would you like to see?



Scott Morrison:

My view is to always stick to my areas of responsibility under my portfolio and I think  that's important as being a member of the team. We've got a very strong team, I'm  very pleased to be part of that team.  Malcolm's a key part of that team, Joe's a key  part of that team, and Tony leads a strong team.  I think that's the difference between  us and the Labor Party: we're united, they're divided.



Matthew Franklin:

In principle are you as a man, put aside your position within the Coalition, in favour of  the idea the principle of a government body having an oversight function over a free  media?



Scott Morrison:

I would share the view of I think millions of Australians that would be reticent about  those sorts of principles. I mean we have a free press.  I don't always like what it says  but I would defend its right to say it, and as someone who's often at, I think, the  aggressive end sometimes of some media commentary, and individuals, look that goes  with the territory. If you're not robust enough to deal with that then you should find  another occupation.



Peter van Onselen:

Scott Morrison we appreciate you joining us on Australian Agenda, thanks for your  company.



Scott Morrison:

Thanks a lot.
