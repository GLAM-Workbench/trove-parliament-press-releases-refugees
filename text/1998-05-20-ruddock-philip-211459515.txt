MPS 52/98

Â

The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock, 
today launched cele brations to mark the 50TH anniversary of one 
of Australia's key migrant settlement schemes.

Â

At the launch in Melbourne 
of the Adult Migrant English Program's (AMEP) anniversary, Mr Ruddock 
described the program as a world-leading language education service.

Â

"The AMEP helps 
vast numbers of adult migrants and refugees learn the English language 
and therefore settle more successfully in Australia," Mr Ruddock 
said.

Â

"AMEP's importance 
is highlighted by studies which show that migrants with a low level 
of English language skill tend to have a poor employment experience 
and can face social isolation".

Â

"Recent reforms 
of the AMEP aim to improve the flexibility and effectiveness of English 
language tuition, giving migrants access to services that are responsive 
to their changing needs".

Â

Mr Ruddock said the 
AMEP provides 9 million hours of English language tuition a year, and 
in 1997 assisted over 39,000 clients from 89 language backgrounds.

Â

"AMEP contributes 
not only the successful settlement of non-English-speaking migrants 
and refugees, but also to the building of this nation.

Â

"Australia's rich 
cultural diversity and our tolerance and respect for our fellow Australians 
has earned this country an enviable international reputation as a harmonious 
and progressive society.

Â

"The Adult Migrant 
English Program has been a major contributor to this success story".

Â

The AMEP's 50TH anniversary 
celebrations will continue throughout the year and into early 1999, 
culminating in a major international conference on English language 
policy and provision to be held on 10-12 February in Melbourne.

Â

The Minister will launch the Adult Migrant English Program's 50th 
anniversary celebrations today at 11.00am in the ANZ Pavilion, Victorian 
Arts Centre, 100 St Kilda Road.

Â

Wednesday, 20 May, 1998
