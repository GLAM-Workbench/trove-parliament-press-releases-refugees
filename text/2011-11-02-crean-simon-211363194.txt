Topics: MRRT, coal seam gas, Qantas, asylum seekers

LYNDAL CURTIS: The mining tax legislation's being introduced today. Tony Windsor, one of the Independents wants  research into the environmental impact of coal seam gas. You represent regional Australia, does concern about coal seam gas in  regional Australia warrant such a step?

SIMON CREAN: It certainly requires the research. I mean, you've got to get the factual base because there are competing  issues here. It's not just agricultural land versus mining. I think that's capable being addressed.

But it's the impact on the water and of course agriculture, and particularly fertile pieces of our earth such as the Liverpool Plains, such  as the Darling Downs; it's very important we don't deny it that which makes it so productive. I must say though, in terms of the  regions that what the regions really do get is the importance of the mining tax.

LYNDAL CURTIS: Do you think if you'd had the long conversation you'd had with the - you've been able to have with the  public now, first up when the mining tax was first proposed that you could have avoided all the trouble you had over it?

SIMON CREAN: Well look, I said at the time it's always better to consult upfront. And those lessons are learnt, and there has  been active consultation since. There is agreement and we are now introducing it into the parliament. But the fundamental principle  still remains, Lyndal. I think that the lack of consultation, the failure, if you like, upfront on process, muddies the strength of your  argument.

LYNDAL CURTIS: If we could go back to coal seam gas for just one moment. You said the environmental impact should be  looked at, particularly in catchments. Tony Windsor wants, effectively a pause on coal seam gas mining in those catchments until the  environmental science can be done. Is that a reasonable request?

SIMON CREAN: Well at the moment, we have powers under the Environmental Protection Act - to intervene where such  impact impacts on endangered species. That's what we did in the Darling Downs. And we were able to satisfy, based on the science,  based on the technology, that there was no impact on the aquifers.

We can't intervene where species are not endangered. This comes back to the state laws. What we are seeking to do is to get the  states to embrace the same test as we apply. Now if we can get national harmony in that, I together with the research that we're  already funding, then I think that we can move sensibly forward in this debate.

LYNDAL CURTIS: If we could move onto Qantas now; members of the government have condemned the Qantas action. But  in the end, wasn't it the last resort for an airline that was being beset by constant industrial action or threats of industrial action? And  doesn't that show up a problem in the way the Fair Work laws have been structured?

SIMON CREAN: No, because it was too dramatic an escalation, too precipitous. I mean, this essentially was a decision in  which people were literally being pulled off planes as they were being taxied out.

LYNDAL CURTIS: But can you understand Qantas thinking it had - it had - there was no other way of resolving it? No other  way of getting the government to step in to try and get the parties to negotiate?

SIMON CREAN: Well I think that was a poor judgement on Qantas' part - of course there are other ways. I mean, there's no  harm in trying to escalate a dispute to try and get a sensible outcome, but when you leave no options, when you simply lock out a  work force and strand a public, that…[break in transmission] the economy suffers, and the travelling public suffers.

Now the question of how you resolve the dispute always comes back to the requirement to bargain in good faith. It's not for the  government to get involved directly in negotiations, it's for the government to set up a framework that encourages the ability to  undertake those negotiations and resolve it.

LYNDAL CURTIS: But do you think that there was in the end, bargaining in good faith on both parts in this dispute before the  Qantas action?

SIMON CREAN: I think that's a matter for the parties, but certainly, there was no industrial disputation being perpetrated by the  unions at the time the action was taken by the company.

LYNDAL CURTIS: But there were threats of potential action down the track.

SIMON CREAN: Anthony Albanese had been involved in discussions with Transport Workers Union and with Alan Joyce to get  the bans, the limitations pulled off - to get the parties back into good faith. And next thing you know, without any warning to us, they  ground the airline and they lock out a workforce. Now, it would appear that there was some warning to the Liberals. Joe Hockey is  being very evasive on when he can recall being told about this precipitous action.

I say one thing about this, Lyndal: when we as a government learnt, we immediately took action in the national interest. When Joe  Hockey and Tony Abbott learnt, they took action in their political interest; they shut up. They sat on it believing an escalation of the  dispute was in their best political interest, regardless of the consequences for the travelling public.

LYNDAL CURTIS: Qantas is one of the blame games being played in the federal politics, the who knew what when. There's  also a gathering blame game over the deaths of asylum seekers off Java. What does this blame game do to the status of federal  politics? Is it something you should be engaging in?

SIMON CREAN: No, I think we should be trying to find a lot more bipartisan support about how to resolve these difficult issues.  The tragedy that happened in the waters off Java is appalling, and it reinforces that these people who ply the trade - the people  smugglers - have to be deterred. And that requires international cooperation. http://www.minister.regional.gov.au/sc/pressconf/2011/SCT066_2011.aspx (2 of 3) [26/03/2012 3:53:01 PM]

Transcript of interview on ABC News 24

That's why you need a regional framework. That's what we negotiated with Malaysia. That's what we needed the ability of the  parliament to pass so that we could start putting it into place. And once we demonstrate that we've got one country on board for a  regional framework, we can try and extend it.

But what have we do… what's again happened by Dr No? By his cohorts? Say no to everything in their political interest. They don't  have any regard to the national interest or human safety. And these are the consequences. These are the consequences of stubborn  opposition. And the sooner Mr Abbott understands that [break in transmission] got a responsibility to people; he's got a responsibility  to the national interest; the better off this country will be.

ENDS
