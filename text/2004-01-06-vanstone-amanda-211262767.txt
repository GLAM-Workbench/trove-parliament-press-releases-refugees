Update on Nauru

VPS 002/2004

I met today with Mr John Hodges and Mr Gholam Aboss regarding their visit to Nauru.

During our discussion Mr Hodges and Mr Aboss complimented the IOM and the Nauruan Government on the first class job  that they are doing caring for the people involved in the hunger strike.

Both Mr Hodges and Mr Aboss commented on the vast improvements made to the centre over the last 12 months. They  received no complaints from any residents about the facilities and conditions within the centre. Plentiful food, fresh water and  air conditioned accommodation is provided. They confirm that there is no razor wire surrounding the centre.

They informed me that the level of care being provided at the Nauru hospital on Nauru was appropriate and more than  adequate.

They met with Dr Keke who did not raise any concerns about medical resources with them. Dr Keke did express concern  about the long-term health effects of self-starvation on the strikers.

Both Mr Hodges and Mr Aboss urged the hunger strikers to stop their protest of self-harm.

I have already indicated on several occasions that when the Government receives updated consolidated country information  about conditions in Afghanistan from the UNHCR we will examine the implications for those cases on Nauru previously  assessed by DIMIA.

I thank Mr Hodges and Mr Aboss for undertaking the trip to Nauru on behalf of the Government and for reporting back to me  today. I look forward to receiving their written report in the next week or so.
