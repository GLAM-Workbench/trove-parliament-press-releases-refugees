E&OE……………………….…………………………………………………………………

GARY HARDGRAVE:

Well, Tony Abbott it was a big welcome you got around the Ekka grounds today.

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, Gary it was an amazing welcome and I was extremely grateful for the warmth of the response. I think it was  probably because I had my two daughters with me and I am told they have rock star status but I would never claim that for  myself Gary because I am merely a politician.

GARY HARDGRAVE:

Yeah, no it’s fair enough and long may you consider yourself not equal to your daughters. I think that is not a bad way to  go, Tony.

TONY ABBOTT:

I learnt from the news last night that if you Google Tony Abbott and you press the search button the first thing that comes  up is ‘Tony Abbott’s daughters’ and well it just goes to show that a lot of people recognise true talent when they see it.

GARY HARDGRAVE:

You have been put in your place by any other measure.

TONY ABBOTT:

Absolutely.

GARY HARDGRAVE:

Now, Maude and Loretta my colleagues here at 4BC were devastated because they saw the throng and they said ‘we  want Tony.’ Now, they should have gone after you daughters I reckon.

TONY ABBOTT:

Exactly and both Francie and Bridgie would have been only too happy to come and be interviewed I am sure but they  were doing their best to keep Dad on the straight and narrow.

GARY HARDGRAVE:

Ok, next time we will make it a date. Now, serious stuff today, you have called in for a judicial inquiry and in fact  committing to one within the first six months should you win in a months’ time into the home insulation disaster. What is

the idea of that?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, it has been an absolute disaster, it has been a disaster for everyone involved with it commercially and it has been a  tragedy particularly for the families of the four young men who died in those roofs. Now, the Fuller family, Kevin and  Christine Fuller have called for a judicial inquiry and in order to keep faith with them and the other families of the boys who  died, in order to keep faith with the tens and thousands of people who were working in this sector who trusted Kevin Rudd  and had their trust betrayed. I think it is important to get to the bottom of this, to find out exactly what happened, exactly  who was to blame in order to make sure that we never have anything like this happen again.

GARY HARDGRAVE:

I guess following on from the Coroner’s report here in Queensland it is important in one way to get this at least on the  agenda in this election.

TONY ABBOTT:

Absolutely, look Mr Rudd can make all the promises in the world but the reality is he has been Prime Minister before, he  was responsible for some monumental blunders. There was the border protection blunder which created the 50,000 illegal  arrivals that we have had. There was the school halls disaster where we spent billions more than we should have for  these overpriced halls and gyms and so on and then of course there was the pink batts tragedy where these four young  men needlessly died. There was some 220 house fires, 1,000 electrified roofs, almost a quarter of a million shoddy and  sub-standards jobs done. Two and half billion dollars blown, all because it seems Mr Rudd was desperate to get  something done and wasn’t prepared to listen to wiser heads. Now, this is the Rudd Government in action. At the moment  Mr Rudd is trying to say oh look forget all of that just focus on the future but we only know how someone is likely to  perform in the future by looking at how they did perform in the past. I just think that Mr Rudd shouldn’t be allowed to run  away from his record.

GARY HARDGRAVE:

Now, Tony Abbott as I understand it the Government is now extending its asylum seeker ads for another two weeks, how  can they do that? Have you sought any legal advice on whether this is appropriate?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, look this is an absolute scandal, it is a sign that this Government is utterly shameless because the ads they are  running are not designed to stop people from getting on a boat from Australia to Australia. They are designed to stop  people getting on a boat in Indonesia to Australia and yet the ads are running not in Indonesia but here in Australia. So, as  Nick Xenophon the independent Senator from South Australia has said, these are not directed at boat people with a b,  these are directed at vote people, with a v. So, it’s political advertising pure and simple funded by the taxpayer. We said  when they asked us for permission to run these ads as they are required to do under the caretaker convention. Look, you  can run everything except the domestic ads targeted at voters, not at potential illegal boat arrivals. You can do everything  except those ones and the Government today has written back to us and said you can go to hell. Well, it is a shameless  breach of the caretaker convention, it is absolutely unprecedented. It seems that they have had no advice that they can do  this and it just goes to show that there is no convention that this Government won’t trash in its desire to hold on to power.  This is why it is so important that a government with not the slightest scruple in the world be punished at the ballot box on  September 7.

GARY HARDGRAVE:

Would you seek legal advice as to whether you could send the bill for these ads if they are played after you have said no  to the Labor Party? Surely if it is that they are breaching the caretaker provisions and they are they are political ads, if that  is the advice you have received, the Labor Party would have to pay for it.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, this is political advertising paid for by the taxpayer. The Government admits that it is highly contentions and yet they  are running it in the caretaker period in defiance of the caretaker convention. The preliminary legal advice was that the

caretaker conventions are not [inaudible] but I would like to get some further advice because this is just absolutely  shameless, absolutely shameless and frankly the Commonwealth public servants who are being forced to act this way by  this Government I think would be feeling very, very embarrassed tonight.

GARY HARDGRAVE:

Alright, well Tony Abbott preferences do you deal with Clive Palmer, Bob Katter all the other minor parties in trying to  make sure that you get their second choice vote?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, ultimately it is a matter for the Party organisation in the different states but my view is that if you want to change the  government there is no point in voting for minor parties, independents or celebrities. The only way to change the  government is to vote for the Liberal National Party, for the Coalition. I don’t think our preferences are going to be  distributed but look we will make a formal decision on where preferences will go in the form of the time but I am not going  to do deals. I am not going to lead a minority government. I want to lead a strong majority government because we have  seen minority governments for the last three years. It produces weak government, government that betrays its  commitments but the interesting thing is that Kevin Rudd is already planning to do this kind of a deal. He has refused to  rule out another deal with the Greens even though his own Treasurer said Labor should govern alone or not alone.

GARY HARDGRAVE:

Alright, four weeks to go tomorrow and no doubt we will get a chance to talk to you again between now and election day.  The debate is on Sunday night. Is there going to be more than just one debate?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I hope there will be another two events involving myself and Mr Rudd but rather than just have an insiders debate  involving politicians and press gallery journalists worthy though that is. I hope the two subsequent will involve the  questioning of Mr Rudd and myself by members of the public because in the end that is what it is all about. It is about  responding to peoples’ concerns. This election should be about the people of Australia and their welfare. It shouldn’t just  be about me or Mr Rudd or the egos of politicians.

GARY HARDGRAVE:

It sounds like your daughters have got you well contained Tony.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, you listen to your family, you particularly listen to your kids and you get a huge bucket of cold water poured over any  pretentions you might have.

GARY HARDGRAVE:

Alright nice to talk to you Tony Abbott, thanks for your time.

TONY ABBOTT:

Thanks Gary.
