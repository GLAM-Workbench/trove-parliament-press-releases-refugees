INTERVIEW ON SKY AM AGENDA

28 APRIL 2011

SUBJECTS: Baby Bonus, Asylum Seekers, Carbon Price.

ASHLEIGH GILLON:

Welcome back. Joining me on our panel of politicians this morning from  Brisbane, David Bradbury the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer  and from Melbourne today, Shadow Small Business Minister Bruce Billson,  good morning to you both. I know that you both know that population  growth is a big issue, we were talking about it a lot before the last  election, now the Anglican Church of all organisations is today calling on  the Government to cut the growth rate, the birth rate in Australia, cut  migration levels. The way it wants to cut the birth rate is rule out  incentives like the baby bonus for families, David Bradbury do you think  that the Government will look at that seriously? I know of course that the  Government has already means-tested the bonus, is it looking at  tightening it up even further or perhaps scrapping it all together?

DAVID BRADBURY:

Good morning Ashleigh. Look, we've got no plans to scrap the baby bonus  and as you rightly point out, we have made some changes to the baby  bonus over the last couple of years, in particular it is means-tested to  ensure that it is targeted at providing assistance to those families that  need it most. We take the view that the baby bonus, along with the range  of other measures that we have in place to support families are a package  of measures and they are important in providing assistance. We all know,  we saw inflation figures yesterday, we saw the cost of living, we know  that it's not getting any cheaper to bring up kids and we think that it is  important for Governments to provide support to families who are out  there trying to do the best they can to bring up their kids so their children  become great contributors to society. I haven't seen the submission that  the advisory body to the Anglican Church has made but I think that when  we do have a discussion about sustainable population, we do need to  acknowledge the challenges of an ageing population and that is  something that has come through very strongly in each of the  intergenerational reports. With an ageing population, you need a  population coming through, whether that be through natural birth rates or

migration, in order to ensure that the ageing population has the goods  and services being produced through an active and participating labour  force. These are big challenges, but this submission will no doubt be  taken into account with the range of other submissions that will be made.

GILLON:

Bruce Billson, this position from the Church is a far cry from Peter  Costello's. He urged families to have one child for each parent then one  for the country. Do you think we need to look at tackling the birth rate in  this country?

BRUCE BILLSON:

I was surprised with the recommendation that it was somehow thought  that the baby bonus was an issue when in the submission itself it talks  about the impact of a growing population on people's quality of life. I  would have thought at a time when we're not even replacing Australians  that are passing away by new-born Australians that attacking the baby  bonus would have been the last thing you would do. The cost pressures  on new families that chose to have children are immense. The assistance  should be available at that time, and if there are genuine concerns as I  believe there are about what is happening with our cities, it goes to the  question of how you sustainably settle the population. Having coherent  strategies in place, the Coalition took a sustainable population and  settlement strategy to the last election, which might be better reading for  the Anglican Church to have a look at how you would go about making  sure that a properly managed sustainable population is settled  successfully so as to preserve our environment to maintain living  standards and to make sure we are not undermining the quality of life of  people. That would be a far smarter and coordinated way to go.

GILLON:

Also a strange way to start this program, bipartisan support on this issue  but let's move on to another issue where I don't think you're going to be  on the same page. David Bradbury today the Canberra Times has got  some new figures about how much the Government is spending helping  asylum seekers get access to legal and visa advice. Apparently, it's  costing us more than $11 million a year, that is five times more than the  Government was spending on it in John Howard's last year in Government  and that is only a tiny proportion of costs, isn't it? It doesn't take into  account all of the costs involved in setting up new detention centres on  the mainland. This report shows that the influx of asylum seekers is  costing Australia a fortune.

BRADBURY:

It's an interesting comparison because the years of comparison clearly  show the lower levels of years as far as the Howard Government is  concerned. I think if you go back and have a look at some of those peak  years, in particular the late 1990's and the early 2000's, you'll see very  clearly that the figures are much more comparable. We take the view,  and I think that this is bipartisan, that when it comes to those people who  are seeking to navigate their way through the system of visa application  processes that there should be some assistance in place. That's not just a  view that we've come up with, it's a view that was in place and a part of  the overall set of arrangements under the Howard Government. I don't  think that is in contention. Clearly on the broader issue of the number of  arrivals, we continue to work very hard and Minister Bowen, apart from  the discussion and activity that has occurred in recent times in relation to  specific matters in regards to detention centres and broader policy  reform, Minister Bowen has been working very hard to try to achieve the  regional solution that we are advocating. This is something that we've  always said would take some time and I know that there is a lot of  frustration out there with people that this is taking a long time, but we  said that it would take some time. In the end, we've taken the view that it  is important that we try to build a sustainable and durable long term  regional solution to what is a regional problem. I think that that's where  the Government is at, we continue to work hard and I know Minister  Bowen has had further success in relation to the most recent Bali  meetings. He is just as determined today as the day that he was given  this very difficult job to progress our plans for a regional settlement  solution.

GILLON:

Well time of course is something that asylum seekers in detention centres  around this country do have a lot of at the moment. We've seen the  protest at Villawood going on for more than a week now. Bruce, yesterday  Tony Abbott seemed to be calling for police to move in and sort it out and  get people off the roof. Those left there seem to be engaging in a peaceful  protest, is there anything wrong with that? It's not like they can take to  the streets to make this protest.

BILLSON:

What we need to focus on is what a shambolic situation we face now with  the Government's mishandling of this whole issue. The numbers are  increasing, the effort to accommodate them is all over the place, we're  seeing rioting and damaging and destruction of taxpayer funded  properties. Then, you see a Minister with powers available to him to deal  with people who commit criminal acts while they're here, notwithstanding  unlawful arrival that begins the process, he's got no ticker. He won't  exercise the tools that are already available to him to bring back in  control a very difficult situation that is of his own making. There is no

light at the end of the tunnel, the regional solution David talked about and  we talked about it last time we were on your program Ashleigh, is  nowhere in sight. The East Timorese have told the Government over and  over again that they don't want a detention centre in East Timor. The  standard of living for the detainees within that centre would exceed the  standard of living of many East Timorese, they just don't want it. The  Government keeps stalking them about an idea that nobody is committed  to except for senior Government figures to make it sound like they've got  some kind of plan. What the Government needs to do is ring the President  of Nauru and re-open the Nauru centre and make it very clear to people  who chose to fund organised crime syndicates to get themselves  unlawfully to Australia that that is not the direct way of exercising the  Australian 'big heart' of offering humanitarian places. That is not orderly,  and all of this rioting and destruction of property that you're seeing now is  just another sign of how the Government is mishandling this whole issue  of unlawful arrivals with no plan on the table and no end to this shambolic  arrangement in sight.

GILLON:

David Bradbury on another front the Government is battling is the carbon  tax. We've seen on the front page of The Australian today that Marius  Kloppers has been a big fan in the past of putting a price on carbon and  that he does want the Government to be taking action on climate change  but now he is saying he wants the Government to take a sector specific  approach, in particular he is concerned that exporters could lose out.  There still isn't any guarantees is there that no jobs will be lost under the  carbon tax?

BRADBURY:

Mr Kloppers has expressed his views and he is entitled to do that and I  know that previously he has also expressed a very strong view that it is in  our national interest and the interests of the resources sector amongst  other sectors in the Australian economy that we do put a price tag on  pollution. That is what this Government is intent on doing. In terms of the  specific views he might have in terms of representing the specific views of  his business, he will express those views and he is entitled to do that as  are the other stakeholders that will have something to say in this debate.  But for the Government's part, what we have said is that we will consult  very widely and we are doing that and that's why Mr Kloppers and others  within his organisation are represented in various roundtables that the  Government is a part of and has created. But we have said, and we've  been very consistent about this, we want to ensure that we put a price  tag on pollution so that we can drive the signals and the investment in a  clean energy future. In doing that, we are very mindful of trying to ensure  that we put in place a scheme that does not allow for jobs to be exported.

This is why there will be particular attention paid to those emissions  intensive trade exposed industries in the same way...

GILLON:

David, let me just pick you up on that point. You mentioned that you are  meeting with this business roundtable, Bruce Billson it is a fair point that  there are a lot of business leaders that have agreed with Marius Kloppers  and are saying that businesses want certainty, they do want to see a  price on carbon although to listen to your side of politics you'd think that  every business leader thinks that it is a crazy idea.

BILLSON:

No, what you're hearing from those people who have been invited to  participate in these so-called roundtables is they are going along to these  meetings to offer their contribution and basically being told that we're not  that fussed about your view on whether this should happen or not, we can  muck around with the details but thanks very much, nobody is listening.  That's what they are complaining about. Marius Kloppers' contribution is  going to the heart of the debate where he was previously of a view that if  there was going to be a co-ordinated global action, that Australia should  be a part of that, and that is a reasonable point. But now what he  describes as the 'go it alone' strategy...

BRADBURY:

Don't go putting words in to his mouth.

BILLSON:

It's something that he's not that keen on knowing that it will  disadvantage his businesses and all the people employed in it. Even the  AWU, the sponsor of Wayne Swan's political career is going out there and  raising similar concerns. The AWU, that's not a big company it's the AWU  the sponsors of Wayne Swan's political career telling the Treasurer that  he's got it wrong when he thinks the steel industry is going to be just  fine. The Government is talking about assisting industry, they're also  saying that 50% of the revenue raised from their new tax will go to  assisting households. There is also some talk about money going in to  new technologies and it's all based on the CPRS compensation model that  relied on the budget surplus that the Government inherited off the  Coalition to fund that package. Now, that surplus isn't there. How on  earth are they going to maintain that CPRS compensation model that  even industry is saying is inadequate and incomplete and do what the  Government claims it's going to do for households without some reneging  on whether the carbon tax impact on fuel is going to be offset. This is a  mess that is going to export jobs and damage our future.

GILLON:

Well these are all questions that this business roundtable is looking at at  the moment. Bruce Billson and David Bradbury we are out of time. I think  the point David Bradbury was probably going to make is that Marius  Kloppers does still agree that we still need a carbon price even though  there is not a global deal on the table right now. We do appreciate your  insights, thank you for that.

BRADBURY:

Thanks very much.

BILLSON:
