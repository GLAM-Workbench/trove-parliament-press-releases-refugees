LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION  IN THE SENATE  PARLIAMENT HOUSE  CANBERRA. A.C T 2600

The Prime Minister's insistence on continued diplomatic  recognition of the Pol Pot group which he has described as  "the most repressive regime in modern times", is now a  national political issue ,  Senator Ken Wriedt, Senate Opposition '

Leader and Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs, said today.

He was commenting on reports that Mr. Fraser has rejected the  advice of his Foreign Minister and the Department of Foreign  Affairs to withdraw Australia's diplomatic recognition of  Pol Pot.

He said it was obvious there were fundamental policy differences  between Mr. Fraser and Mr. Peacock and it was clear Mr. Fraser's obsessively pro-China line was one of the reasons.

Senator Wriedt said however that it was not the dispute between  Mr. Fraser and Mr. Peacock which was the real issue for  Australians.

"The heart of the matter is not that Mr. Peacock was carpeted  by the Prime Minister but that Mr. Fraser is flatly and stubbornly  opposing public opinion on Kampuchea", Senator Wriedt said.

Senator Wriedt said that Mr. Peacock said in his weekend statements  that he had noted "the strong public feeling" on the matter and  "the great deal of repungance" in Australia towards Pol Pot.

Mr. Peacock had said the issue had to be looked at "in view of  community feeling".

Senator Wriedt said "Mr. Fraser is refusing to do this and is  sticking to recognition of a genocidal regime to suit his anti-  Vietnam, anti-Soviet policies despite the revulsion the  Australian people feel towards Pol Pot. -

Senator Wriedt said that Mr. Fraser's decision told much about  the Prime Minister. "Any leader who will continue recognition  of such a murderous regime cannot be reasoned with. AL  Prime Minister who will reject the moderate advice of a senior  minister is obviously an extremist". .

Senator Wriedt said that, in.Mr, Peacock's words (Sydney Morning  Herald, Monday 14th July),  "to sustain a politically credible  policy, you must have the backing of the majority"

"In recommending to Cabinet that Australia derecognise Pol  Pot,  Mr. Peacock was reflecting Australian public opinion -  something which M r .  Fraser is rejecting, along with the  Foreign Minister's advice",  Senator Wriedt said.

"This is not the first time Mr. Fraser and Mr. Peacock have  differed sharply on a major issue on Indo-China policy". Senator Wriedt said.

He said it was known that the Foreign Minister did not agree  with the Fraser Government's withdrawl of its aid program  from Vietnam in 1979. This had been done in the name of the  Acting Foreign Minister, Mr. Ian Sinclair, while Mr. Peacock  was out of the country.

Labor Party policy, advocated repeatedly in recent months,   is to withdraw diplomatic recognition from Pol Pot on the  grounds that its.'genocidal record merits only condemnation,  and  certainly not any right to have diplomatic recognition.

Senator Wriedt said Mr. Peacock was right in his statements last  Sunday and Monday (60 Minutes and SMH) to recognise what he  called "the feeling of revulsion that exists in Australia" towards  the Pol Pot group which had killed and tortured millions of  Kampucheans between the years 1975 and 1978.

Senator Wriedt said the Pol Pot group, benefiting from diplomatic  recognition by Australia and some other countries (but not  the United States or Britain), continued to repress large  numbers of Kampucheans in refugee camps in Thailand and in the

Thai-Kampuchea border region.

He said armed Pol Pot activities were now leading to a reduction  of international aid to Kampuchea where the need for food and other  assistance was still great.

Senator Wriedt said that the Pol Pot group, fortified by limited  international recognition of the sort given by the Fraser  Government, is using the border area refugees as pawns in its  brutal efforts to destabilise the Phnom Penh administration which

is still struggling with the terrible aftermath of the Pol Pot  era of terror in Kampuchea.

Senator Wriedt called on the Prime Minister to adopt the Foreign  Minister's recommendation that recognition of Pol Pot be withdrawn.

Senator Wriedt said that derecognition did not mean or require  recognition of the Phnom Penh administration.

The question of recognition could be left until the situation  within Kampuchea clarifies. ;

Senator Wriedt said that the Government claims that its policy of  recognising Pol Pot does not mean approval,  the result was  in fact to aid the Pol Pot group's outrageous claim to represent  a people it had brutally brought to the edge of destruction.

Senator Wriedt said Mr. Peacock had publicly recognised that the  Pol Pot issue had become a question of national political  importance.

"Mr. Fraser is flying in the face of public opinion and the  Opposition intends to keep reminding him that this is a national  issue he cannot avoid",  Senator Wriedt said. Â·.

Senator Wriedt said if, as indicated in today's reports, Mr. Fraser intends that Australia should again vote for Pol Pot  at the United Nations later this year, he will be ignoring  Australian public opinion and in effect, ignoring the sufferings

of the Kampuchean people". Ã¢ÂÂ
