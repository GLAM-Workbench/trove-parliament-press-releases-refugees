Showdown, Sky News Australia - Fisher pre-selection,  Craig Emerson, Julia Gillard’s carbon tax, border  protection

Posted on July 03, 2012 21:23

PETER VAN ONSELEN: I’m joined here in the Sky News studio by Labor’s Bruce  Hawker... can we still call you Labor’s Bruce Hawker after you were backing Kevin  Rudd and not the Prime Minister?

BRUCE HAWKER: A bit of a Labor outsider in some parts of Canberra but, yeah, still  loyal.

PETER VAN ONSELEN: Good to have you on board... and former Howard  Government frontbencher Ross Cameron, thanks for your company as well.

ROSS CAMERON: Pleasure.

PETER VAN ONSELEN: Ross, let me come straight to you and ask you... I know  that I was only just making you aware of this before but it’s been breaking news  online on The Australian’s website - shameless plug... James McGrath, the campaign  manager for the LNP [Liberal National Party of Queensland] up at the recent state  election where they had such a thumping victory is... well, he hasn’t announced it as  such but it has been declared that he’s having a run or a tilt at Peter Slipper’s seat... I  almost called it his former seat... on behalf of the LNP against Mal Brough.

...

BRUCE HAWKER: I think probably Mal Brough has got his own issues at the  moment with that litigation that seems to be floating around in the background  involving [James] Ashby and Peter Slipper. There might be a little bit of insurance  work going on there in case that blows up in Brough’s face.

PETER VAN ONSELEN: Well, I’m glad you mention that because apparently there is  some suggestion that more information on this case would be coming out roughly  one week before this pre-selection is my understanding so maybe James McGrath  knows something that we don’t.

BRUCE HAWKER: He may well and, you know, he might just be there because, if  Brough for some reason falls over, they’ve got a candidate who, you know, has got  some street cred at the moment who would be a formidable candidate in that seat  and, you know, you would have to expect that he would win that seat, whoever the  Liberals pre-select there are most likely going to win that seat...

...

PETER VAN ONSELEN: Well, Ross Cameron, you were saying when we were off air  that this is the first panel you’ve been on where it’s stacked in the Liberals’ favour so  let’s prove you right and let’s bring Simon Birmingham, Tony Abbott’s frontbencher  out of Adelaide, into the panel. Simon, thanks for your company.

SIMON BIRMINGHAM: G’day, Peter.

PETER VAN ONSELEN: This is Showdown so let’s just cut straight to it. Who’s the  better candidate - Mal Brough or James McGrath?

SIMON BIRMINGHAM: Well, look, I know them well but I’ve got to say I know  James better. I’ve known James a long time. He’s a first rate candidate. He’s a first  rate guy. He’s got some street cred, as Bruce just said, on the political side but he’s  also got a really good policy brain on his shoulders.

PETER VAN ONSELEN: So you’re backing him?

SIMON BIRMINGHAM: Well, I don’t get a vote so I’ll leave that to the pre-selectors but, as I’m saying, very clearly...

PETER VAN ONSELEN: But if you did... if you did... seriously, if you got a vote...

SIMON BIRMINGHAM: Look, if I got a vote, I’d talk to them both and treat them  fairly but you can tell from my comments I know James, I like James, I think James  will do a first rate job for the Liberal Party and he is a candidate for the Party’s future  who definitely has his best years ahead of him and brings some worldly skills to the  Federal Parliament, if he gets there, that we would really benefit from.

PETER VAN ONSELEN: Well, there you go. I mean, Ross Cameron, you’re a former  politician but it sounds like Simon Birmingham’s all but calling Mal Brough a ‘has

been’.

ROSS CAMERON: Well, Simon Birmingham’s expressing a personal view. I mean, he  says he doesn’t even really know Mal Brough so, you know, I mean... but...

SIMON BIRMINGHAM: Let’s not put words in my mouth too much, Peter!

ROSS CAMERON: ... I have a high regard for Simon’s judgement and I’m thrilled to  see we’ve got two outstanding candidates and it looks to me like we’ll have two seats  - Fairfax and Fisher - needing a great candidate and so maybe we’ll wind up with

both of them.

PETER VAN ONSELEN: Well, we might have two Liberals on the program - one out  of Adelaide and one here in you, Ross Cameron - but, I tell you what, don’t try to  make a political comeback because you’re not likely to get the support of Simon  Birmingham.

SIMON BIRMINGHAM: Ross is a great man... couldn’t criticise Ross at all!

ROSS CAMERON: Thank you, Simon.

PETER VAN ONSELEN: Let me bring you in, Bruce Hawker. Let me just, yes,  change the subject entirely. We’ll move on to the big national issues of the week and  likely the months ahead - I mean, at the end of the day, the standoff on refugees  and obviously the carbon tax. Now, Bruce, the carbon tax... we’ve seen some  theatrics - let’s put it that way - by Craig Emerson. Look, at the end of the day,  strategy is what you do. I mean, it strikes me that, strategically, it is the wrong play  by the Labor Party to try to mock Tony Abbott over his inflated rhetoric. I’m the first  person to agree that it’s been inflated but, at the end of the day, shouldn’t it be  commentators doing that or strategists like yourself, not MPs and Ministers and  indeed the Treasurer on Twitter, the Prime Minister, Craig Emerson... it strikes me  that this is silly strategy.

BRUCE HAWKER: Look, I wouldn’t do it, frankly, if I was asked to and I think he  was poorly advised to do that for the reasons that you’ve enunciated and, let’s face  it, he hasn’t got a very good voice either so, look, none of it really gelled as far as I  was concerned and it really, I think, probably gave an opportunity to our opponents

to, you know, take something of a moral high ground on the issue and I don’t think  they’re in a position to take the moral high ground on it so I wouldn’t advise it.

...

PETER VAN ONSELEN: I’ve been told that the Prime Minister’s office approved this.  Now, I don’t know if that’s scuttlebutt as per internal politics of the Labor Party but I  heard they at least knew about it beforehand.

BRUCE HAWKER: I don’t know whether that’s the case or not. I think, though, that  everyone should put that down in a little box and say ‘let’s not try that one again, it  doesn’t work’ and, frankly, there are, you know, much more serious ways of engaging  on an issue like this where, you know, the danger for anyone doing that is that it  looks like you’re making fun of a lot of concerns that people have and I don’t think  you should do that. In fact, but can I just say this about Craig. You know, no one  goes into bat more relentlessly for Labor in very difficult circumstances than he does  so, you know, this is a one off incident but, you know better than anybody else,  every day he’s up there taking, you know, the fast and high balls and dodging and  ducking and weaving and trying to hit a few, so he deserves credit for being  somebody who’ll have a go because a lot of people in politics will stand back when  the going gets tough and say ‘oh, no, I’ll leave it for somebody else to do’.

SIMON BIRMINGHAM: And Bruce...

PETER VAN ONSELEN: Alright, well, a quick free kick for you, Simon Birmingham.

SIMON BIRMINGHAM: Well, Bruce knows from the leadership challenge earlier  this year that Craig was out there as Julia Gillard’s spokesman, day in day out, so I  suspect he wouldn’t be doing much without it being run past her or her office but, I  mean, the whole thing is, frankly, insulting. Whyalla’s part of my electorate as a

Senator for SA. The people there have genuine concerns. Those concerns shouldn’t  be mocked. Those concerns should be respected.

PETER VAN ONSELEN: But, by the same token, Simon Birmingham, they probably  shouldn’t be frightened... have the bejesus frightened out of them by Tony Abbott  and, it has to be said, union leaders by suggesting that they’re going to be wiped off

the face of the map. I mean, it’s about balance on both sides.

SIMON BIRMINGHAM: And, Peter, I think that’s just it. You’ve picked up that the  ‘wipe off the face of the map’ comment was, in fact, from Wayne Hanson, the state  secretary in South Australia of the Australian Workers’ Union, not Tony Abbott’s  quote, but, that aside, Whyalla...

PETER VAN ONSELEN: Sure, but Tony Abbott took up the cudgel and ran with it,  didn’t he?

SIMON BIRMINGHAM: Well, Whyalla... and Tony and I have visited Whyalla and  we’ve talked to local people so we’ve actually been on the ground without having  singing, dancing or hysterics... we’ve talked to them and they understand that if they  hadn’t got a $60+ million bailout under the Steel Transformation Fund, OneSteel’s  operations in Whyalla would be in serious jeopardy and there’s a question for the  long term about OneSteel as to whether that sort of funding will be available in the

future to keep their operations going there, so let’s not say that Whyalla is out of the  woods because it’s now a couple of days into July. Whyalla and OneSteel have got  some real challenges under the carbon tax for a long time into the future.

...

PETER VAN ONSELEN: Let’s move onto the asylum seeker issue. In contrast to  Craig Emerson, there’s no jokes on this one.

...

PETER VAN ONSELEN: Ross Cameron, what’s going on here with human rights  suddenly being the issue that the Liberal Party’s got a problem with vis-ÃÂ -vis Malaysia? You were part of the Government, along with Tony Abbott, that was  prepared to countenance Nauru when they hadn’t signed on, just like Malaysia hasn’t  now.

ROSS CAMERON: Well, the difference with Nauru is, whether or not they sign the  convention [1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees], it was going to be  Australians running the program to Australian standards and it’s not just human  rights, the issue here. I mean, the Malaysia solution, so called solution, has always  been regarded by the Coalition as a dud deal and I think an ordinary person of good  faith who hears the deal is they take...

PETER VAN ONSELEN: The Secretary of the Department [of Immigration and  Citizenship] thinks it would work.

ROSS CAMERON: Oh, well, the Secretary of the Department also was the one who  advised on the original Malaysia solution which the High Court tore into a hundred  tiny pieces. The Secretary of the Department is kind of obliged to uphold the policy of  the Government of the day. Now, what... Abbott made a number of significant  concessions. He said ‘I would support a measure that took the total humanitarian  intake from 13,000 to 20,000’. He said ‘I want Nauru in the mix’ but he said ‘I will  support processing at any centre which is a signatory to the Convention,’ giving the  Government a wider range of choice so I felt that was a material act of good faith.

...

PETER VAN ONSELEN: Let me bring in Simon Birmingham. Look, before we get to  the actual issue of the day I just want to ask you a question. You’re a Liberal  moderate and not like Ross over here who’s part of the hard right of the Liberal  Party... maybe not the hard right, but certainly the right. Let me just ask you straight  up. You weren’t in Parliament during the 2001 Tampa standoff. Would you have been  able to sit back and support the suite of measures that the Coalition went with at that  time?

SIMON BIRMINGHAM: Peter, I’ve got to say they didn’t always sit comfortably  with me. Now, would I have been able to...? You know, that’s ten years ago - who  knows? - but certainly they haven’t always sat comfortably with me but I can now  recognise that, when it boils down, they worked in terms of stopping arrivals, or at  least they contributed to a stopping of arrivals and I think everybody acknowledges  that. The thing that baffles me today is that many of the same people emailing me  and criticising Tony Abbott and the Liberal Party for not accepting the Malaysia  solution are the very same people who a few years ago were attacking John Howard  and the Liberal Party for any notion of offshore processing and wanted it taken off  the table. Now, the Liberal Party has stayed firm in what it believes is an appropriate  policy. We’ve offered, as Ross said, some concessions to try to get an outcome on  this but the Labor Party have shifted from A to Z on this in terms of where their  position is and they’re the ones, really, who should be looking long and hard at  whether Malaysia is suitable to be on the table, given all they’ve said, and I think,  when you boil it down, there’s a simple question that needs to be answered here - how do you stop people risking their lives at sea with the least possible impact on  their human rights and their rights at land? - and I think, in the end, Malaysia is not  that because there is a failure in terms of the safeguards in terms of Australia’s  capacity to guarantee their protection and their rights. Nauru, with other processes  and particularly TPVs [temporary protection visas] in place, has that capacity where  Australia can at least guarantee the safety, the health, the education standards et  cetera that you would expect while people are dealt with.

BRUCE HAWKER: But there’s very real contradiction in Tony Abbott’s position here.  On the one hand he says ‘I couldn’t countenance Malaysia because it’s not a  signatory to the refugee convention’...

PETER VAN ONSELEN: You’re talking about tow backs.

BRUCE HAWKER: ... and yet they’re going to tow them back to Indonesia?  President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono is right here in the country right now. It’d be  interesting to see what he’s said to Tony Abbott about that because there is a  contradiction in all that and it just goes to my point about I don’t think he really  wants to find a solution.

SIMON BIRMINGHAM: And, Bruce, there’s a difference between turning a boat  back to country from which it has come and picking somebody up and sending them  off to another country to go at the back of a line of refugees where they may never  make it to the front of the line and resettlement.

PETER VAN ONSELEN: I am loathe to jump in but I have to because unfortunately  I’m right out of time and I’ve got a pre-recorded interview that we’re about to show  up next with the Tibetan Prime Minister [in exile] so, gentlemen, as fiery as this is,  thank you for your company unfortunately.

SIMON BIRMINGHAM: Thanks, guys.

PETER VAN ONSELEN: Bruce Hawker, Ross Cameron and, joining us out of  Adelaide, Simon Birmingham, thanks for your company as well.
