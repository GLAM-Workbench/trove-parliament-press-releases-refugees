Government must intervene in Nauru crisis

The worsening situation on Nauru has reached a critical point with reports that a man who has  been on a hunger strike for almost 50 days in in real danger of losing his life, the Australian  Greens said today.

“There is a person’s life hanging in the balance and I am calling on Minister Bowen to forget the  politics of this debate for just one moment and intervene,” the Greens’ immigration  spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.

“The Government must bring this man to Australia so he can receive the level of care that he so  obviously needs.

“It is tragic that vulnerable refugees who have been dumped on Nauru feel that harming  themselves is the only way they can bring attention to their terrible situation.

“We are clearly at a dangerous point in this situation and a disappointing time in Australian  politics and I urge all people in detention on Nauru to look after themselves and each other in  this difficult time.

“The race to the bottom on immigration policy that has consumed the two old parties needs to  be put aside so we can sort out the crisis on Nauru that has driven vulnerable people to a point  of self-destruction.”
