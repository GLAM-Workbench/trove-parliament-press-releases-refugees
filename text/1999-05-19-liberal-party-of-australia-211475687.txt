INQUIRY INTO RETURN OF 
PREGNANT WOMAN TO CHINA

Â

Â

The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock, 
today announced that the in dependent Inquiry instituted on May 
10 to thoroughly examine allegations surrounding the treatment of a 
PRC national following her return to China, would be conducted by Mr 
Tony Ayers, AC.

Â

Mr Ruddock said Mr David Sadleir, who was to have 
undertaken the Inquiry, withdrew from this assignment due to the pressure 
of other professional commitments which needed his full attention.

Â

“Mr Ayers is a distinguished Australian and was 
a long serving permanent head of a number of government departments 
until his retirement last year from the position of Secretary of the 
Department of Defence.

Â

“Mr Ayers is eminently suited to undertake this 
important Inquiry and has extensive knowledge of the structures and 
operations of government”.
