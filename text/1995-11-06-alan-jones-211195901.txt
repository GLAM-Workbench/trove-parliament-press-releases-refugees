Radio 2UE with Alan Jones, 6 November 1995: transcript [Topics: Yitzhak Rabin funeral;  policy; drugs guide; Superannuation; Asian immigration]

JONES:

The world lost one of its great peace makers at the weekend, Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli Prime  Minister gunned down by a Jewish fanatic who felt that Rabin had yielded too much to the  Palestinians. Paul Keating is going to the funeral. As I understand it, John Howard has been  refused permission to accompany him. And the death of Mr Rabin has pushed the phoney election  campaign from the front pages for the moment. The polls this morning show a swing back to the  Prime Minister and to Labor. ALP support allegedly rose 3.5 points to 48.5, which is just 3 points  short of the Opposition's 51.5, the Coalition's approval rating dropped 3.5%. Pollsters are saying  Labor could have won an election if it were held this year. They believe the Government could  make up the difference if it went into an election 4% down in the opinion polls. Mr Keating has also  outrated Mr Howard as the preferred Prime Minister with 48% support up 3 points. According to  this latest Morgan poll, Mr Howard's approval rating apparently has dropped 3 points to 41%. I  don't know what you make of all this, but I thought we'd talk to John Howard.

John Howard, good morning.

HOWARD:

Good morning Alan.

JONES:

Mr Rabin. Did you seek permission from the Prime Minister to accompany him to the funeral?

HOWARD:

Yes, I did, and I was told by his office that there was no seat available for me on the plane. I then  sought to speak to the Prime Minister himself and I was given what could only be described as a  complete run-around by his office. They refused to give me his number, and I in fact took off to  Canberra from Sydney because I knew that the plane was leaving, Mr Keating's plane was leaving  Canberra to go to Perth to collect a 707 which has a capacity of 60 or 70 to go to Tel Aviv at  7.30pm and his office finally rang my home at about 7.10pm and I was then in the air and they  took off in the knowledge that I was on the way to Canberra to get on the flight if I was allowed. I  can only conclude that the Prime Minister just didn't want me there compared to the behaviour of  the British Prime Minister John Major who's being accompanied to the funeral by Tony Blair and  also Paddy Ashdowne, the Leader of the Liberal Democrats; and President Clinton of course, Mr  Dole, the foremost Republican, Senator Dole in the Senate and a very large bipartisan contingent  from both sides of Congress. The British and the Americans are showing the Australian  Government how these things are done. Events of this nature are above politics. It is a tragic  international event, and what Mr Keating has done is an insult to the Jewish people of Australia,  because he has politicised what is an event that is above politics.

JONES:

Now, when you sought to make contact with the Prime Minister you couldn't, and ....

HOWARD:

I was just given the run-around. I rang his office and asked for his number and I was told that  somebody would ring me back and I mean, I was not invited of course. I heard about it on the  news and I have very very close links with the Jewish community of Australia. I've always been a  very staunch public defender of the State of Israel all of my political career, and I regard the thing  as an awful tragic event. This man had given so much for peace and I wanted to demonstrate my  bipartisan expression of outrage with the Prime Minister. It was an occasion where the fact that  I'm Liberal and he's Labor should have been put to one side and the spontaneous proper thing  would have been for him to have rung me and said, 'John, I'm going to Israel tonight, can you get  to Canberra?' But not him. That's what John Major and President Clinton did, and that's what any  decent national leader would do. We are dealing with a man who plays the political card on every  occasion and I think the Australian public should know how events like this are handled by the  current Prime Minister of this country.

JONES:

Can we extrapolate from that then some further conclusions in relation to this 'phoney' election  campaign? It does appear to many out there that there are significant differences as on this issue  between the way John Howard thinks and the way Paul Keating thinks. And on so many instances  it does appear that we are being told, this is the worst government we've had in a long time yet  we are not going to change anything says John Howard.

HOWARD:

Well, I'm not saying that. I'm going to change a lot of things.

JONES:

On savings for example. Peter Costello made a speech last week.

HOWARD:

Well, you haven't heard the full story on our ....

JONES:

Can I just say something and ask you for a comment? I mean, wouldn't the first thing you'd say, if  you wanted to make really a significant policy initiative on savings, if you were to say, 'Look, to  encourage savings as opposed to expenditure, we will not be taxing the interest that accrues on  savings'.

HOWARD:

Alan, that is one thing you would say. Can I repeat you haven't heard the full gamut of what the  Liberal Party will be saying on savings yet? Most of the publicity on the statement on Super last  week focussed on those things where we said we weren't going to make changes but Peter  Costello said that we had quite a bit more to say and the very thing that you have raised covers  one of the areas where we will have a lot more to say. So can I repeat again that people should  stay tuned as far as savings initiatives are concerned. You have not yet heard the full gamut of  what the Coalition proposes in this area.

JONES:

Is there a reason why you're not telling the Australian electorate now?

HOWARD:

We are doing what every Opposition does. I mean, what in effect we are being asked to do is to  make the policy speech six months before the launch of the campaign. I mean, the tradition of the  Australian politics is that you start the campaign with a policy speech and in that policy speech you  tell the Australian people in summary why they should vote for you. Now, that is what we are  doing. I find it quite extraordinary that I amongst all Opposition leaders since the war in Australia  is expected to make my policy speech four, five, six, seven, eight months in advance of the  election.

JONES:

Okay. Last week - you're a Member of Parliament who represents a constituency within New South  Wales. New South Wales was dominated last week by talk about drug taking. You yourself are a  father of children of that impressionable teenage, adolescent age. Yet there was, a guide we learn  about at the weekend called "Pleasure Principles" which is a consumers guide.

I do apologise for the language, to both my listeners and to you because neither of us actually  speaks like this, but the language is sub-titled: "Piss, Powders and Pleasure" and it describes  heroin as "very safe for recreational users" and it gives descriptions of how to inject heroin and  steroids and to sniff amyl nitrate, and it is funded by no less than the Commonwealth Department  of Health. Do you have a comment about that?

HOWARD:

Well, I saw that report. I mean, this is typical of the sort of thing that Carmen Lawrence allows to  go on. I mean, this kind of thing is an insult to parents who are grappling with that very very  difficult interaction, the tension and interaction of their children and drugs. It gives an imprimatur.

I want to make it very clear that I am not one of those in the community who believes that the  solution to this problem is to legalise drug-taking. I do not believe it is. I think that is populist  nonsense and this idea that you cure this problem by patting it on the head and saying, you know,  it's not too bad after all, is a counsel of defeatism and it's also just bowing to a popular thing, and  we will certainly pursue the fact that that is being funded. I mean, this is typical of the way in  which some of these departments have been, I think, white- - anted by people who take a very  very permissive view. And we will certainly be pursuing that.

JONES:

On the question of business, which has historically been one of your constituencies, last week they  would have suffered a little bit to know that the superannuation contributions will rise to 9 per cent  funded by business - Robert Hill today saying business must contribute to the costs of higher  education. Aren't they already contributing?

HOWARD:

I saw that interview and what he was - he wasn't saying they must. He would like them to  contribute more but business only contributes to something like that if there's some kind of  incentive provided. The question of compelling them to contribute - they do contribute  magnificently as well - already, but the idea of having greater interaction between business and  the higher education sector is a feature of - for higher education in the United States and in other  parts of the world, but most particularly in the United States. I think the idea of encouraging  business for its own benefit to put more resources into education is a very good thing.

JONES:

Mr Keating dragged up the anti-Asian immigration issue last week. Did you withstand that?

HOWARD:

Well, I think he does himself more damage than he does me. The Asian community of Australia  knows that I treat all Australians equally. They remember that it was the Liberal Party that  abolished the White Australia policy. It was Malcolm Fraser's Government, of which I was a  member, that welcomed Indo-Chinese refugees into this country. It is an appalling piece of- it's  complete dishonesty and a lie for the Prime Minister to say that I would send people back. I mean,  what - I haven't heard the Prime Minister make such an outrageous claim in years. He's actually  saying that I would repatriate Australians citizens to the country of their birth.

JONES:

Then if all of this is untrue, aren't we surely ripe for a piece of legislation to be introduced into the  Parliament that somehow guarantees integrity in government? Shouldn't there be some  prosecution, some sanction, against politicians lying to an electorate which has no way of eliciting  from those same politicians the truth?

HOWARD:

Perhaps I'm naive - you may say I am - but in the long run the ultimate sanction is the vote of the  people. I mean, I'm not saying there's anything wrong with the concept of truth in political  advertising legislation, but in the long run the only way ultimately that people get their just  deserts on this is that the people have their say.

JONES:

He said that the tax cuts were L-A-W law, which virtually won an election, and they're still not L-A-W.

HOWARD:

No, they're not.

JONES:

That's a lie.

HOWARD:

But one hopes that the Australian people have not forgotten that at the time of the next election  and one hopes that when the Prime Minister - -

-

JONES:

When is that going to be?

HOWARD:

I think in March.

JONES:

Have we got to go through all this stuff for another three or four months?

HOWARD:

Well, there's one bloke who can bring that to an end. As far as I'm concerned I'd still be happy if  he called the election. I hope he comes back to Australia on Wednesday and calls it. I'd be very  happy to have an election before Christmas.

JONES:

That would have to then be the 16th rather than the 9th, wouldn't it?

HOWARD:

Yes, it would be.

JONES:

Right in the middle of Christmas shopping. That would be the last thing they'd want.

HOWARD:

I think it would be great. I mean, he's probably now left it too late to call it because the 9th was  probably the last date that you could do it. I think the 16th would be too close and cause a lot of  discomfort. But I simply say that to make the point that we are ready, but I suspect now that it  will be in March.

JONES:

OK. Good to talk to you. Thank you for your time.
