' “The romainder of the lf>0 people resctiod at sea

ihei r future-was determined,n the Minister for ÃÂ mini grail on

and Ethnic Affairs Mr M.lohael MacKellar said today,

"The dee 1 s:ion to land them takes account- of conditions  .  '  i

on board includingÂ· file ability of tlie siiip's crew to look af ter

such a large number of people,*’  lie said, j

“While the matter is being sorted out it seems

unreasonable to penalise the master and crew ÃÂ³/ho acted .in

a humanitarian way,1 1

There has been no response yet from the British

Government to the Australian Government* s request that '

appropriate guarantees ho given for their resettloment,

Mr MacKellar sojd the Australian Government1s

position has been that the country of a ship*s. registration

should offer a broad guarantee lor resettlement of reftigeea

rescued at seaÂ« The normal inierpreta.tion of this obligation

assumes that the Government responsible should undertake the j

resctiloment of those refugees not accepted for resettlement /

by other countries. This is a practice which has been Ã¢ÂÂ

largely accepted by the internat.i onal community. An

example of Australia honoxiring this obligation was when it

accepted responsibility for the resettlement of refugees

rescued at sea by an Australian registered vessel the Akuna .
