Media Release: Withdrawal of Manus Island health services

April 30, 2018

Today’s withdrawal of International Health and Medical Services (IHMS) as the Australian government’s health  provider on Manus Island will mean further erosion of crucial health support for refugees and people seeking asylum in  Papua New Guinea, Greens Immigration spokesperson Nick McKim said.

"Health supports for detainees on Manus island have never been at an acceptable level, but it now seems inevitable  that the humanitarian catastrophe will worsen with increased risk of further self-harm and mental illness," Senator  McKim said.

"Minister Dutton is claiming that there is a new health provider but won’t reveal who it is and what level of services it  has been contracted to provide. What is he trying to hide?"

"There are many hundreds of people on Manus Island and in Port Moresby who have been harmed and traumatised  while in Australia’s offshore detention regime."

"They deserve better than Mr Dutton attempting to wash his hands of responsibility."

"The only way for Mr Dutton to fulfil his duty of care to Australia’s Manus Island detainees is to bring them to Australia  where they can be supported to recover from the harm."
