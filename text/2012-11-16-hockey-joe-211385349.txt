THE HON JOE HOCKEY MP

SHADOW TREASURER

SUNRISE - BIG GUNS OF POLITICS   CHANNEL 7  16 NOVEMBER 2012

E&OE…………………………………………………………………………………

PRESENTER:

Let's check in with our Big Guns of Politics this morning - Environment Minister Tony Burke  and Shadow Treasurer Joe Hockey. Good morning to both of you. Tony, if I can ask you in  relation to this (Ford) incident. The Manufacturing Workers Union says the Government  needs to put its money where its mouth is. Their stats say that 33% of local, state and federal  Government cars are Aussie made. Shouldn't you all be driving Australian-made vehicles?

TONY BURKE:

I do. But what is happening now is we are gradually increasing - across the board. The  challenge for Australian-made vehicles across the board has been that we were behind the  curve in moving to more fuel-efficient cars. A whole lot of the Government investment that  we have been putting into the car industry is about making sure we can have Australian-made  hybrids - about making sure we can have Australian-made, more efficient cars. As they come  on-line, I think you will find more and more Government services doing what I’m doing.

PRESENTER:

Are you saying Ford has failed in that? They have been given the out - ‘Make better cars’. If  you look at the car sales numbers in Australia, Ford is woeful. Falcons - they are only selling  a couple of hundred a month. They have got the wrong car.

TONY BURKE:

With what is happening with petrol prices, you can understand that people are looking at the  efficiency of a vehicle being key. They will get in front on that again, and that is what the  Government investment is about.

PRESENTER:

Joe, your plan for the car industry? The Coalition has been rethinking a plan to cut $500  million in subsidies. Do you still stand by that now?

JOE HOCKEY:

People are not buying Australian-made cars because they don't want to buy Australian-made  cars. The cars are not meeting their demands as consumers. The Government gave $34  million to Ford in January this year. The Prime Minister said this is going to create an extra  300 jobs. 340 jobs have gone! So wasn't there a guarantee that taxpayers money would  guarantee jobs?

PRESENTER:

So are you saying that we don't need the car industry and car manufacturing in this country?

JOE HOCKEY:

Not at all.

PRESENTER:

You want to cut them off and cut them lose?

JOE HOCKEY:

Not at all, but protection is not the answer. I’ll give you an example. Holden - and you had  Mike Devereux on your show here - Holden lost an entire shift of engine production because  the Chinese Government said that it was only going to buy motor vehicles from Chinese car  manufacturers. Therefore, we lost out. If we apply the same rules to ourselves, any exports  we have got left, forget about it. You will lose it. Any time we go down this protection route  we lose out. The bottom line is we need an efficient car. We need cars that consumers want  and then the motor vehicle industry will survive.

PRESENTER:

Okay. Next topic, I’d love your views on. Israel and Hamas are on the brink of war. Pro-Palestinian activists held a rally and a march in western Sydney overnight. They are calling  for a boycott of the pro-Israeli chocolate cafÃÂ© chain Max Brenner.

PRESENTER:

Joe, your perspective on this? Your Dad - as we know - came here as a Palestinian refugee.  Do you think there is a need to see this here, over what is happening in the Middle East?

JOE HOCKEY:

No.  Emphatically not. Leave the politics to the countries that are playing the politics. Don’t  bring the politics here. That is why people come to Australia - not to revisit all of the woes of  another nation.

PRESENTER:

What does your Dad think seeing all of this?

JOE HOCKEY:

Well, Dad's just so unbelievably grateful that in 1947 Australia welcomed him and he sees  himself only as an Australian. Full stop. He looks at it and he just thinks it will never be  resolved over there. When you look at these sorts of events, how does it stop? But Israel does  have, entirely, a right to protect its citizens.

PRESENTER:

Oh, not to this extent.

JOE HOCKEY:

But hang on, understand this. There have been random bombings from Hamas. Hamas is a  terrorist group. It is not a Government. It has taken over the Gaza Strip from the Palestinian  Authority. It has launched terrorist attacks into Israel. Israel has got a right to defend itself.  Hamas is part of a wider terrorism network. The people of Gaza are not particularly  embracing Hamas, and they are using it as a staging post to attack Israel.

PRESENTER:

The Foreign Minister, Bob Carr, has come out and said the two sides have got to get together.  Terrific, Bob. What can we do though? We are half a world away - we have no influence  whatsoever.

TONY BURKE:

And that is why Bob has put it the way he has. We can't pretend that a nation like ourselves is  going to be able ride in and simply fix this. The call for restraint should be made by Australia.  It is being made by countries all around the world. Ultimately - until you end up with a two-state solution - the option will be always be conflict as the only alternative.

PRESENTER:

I suppose now we are going to go on the Security Council, why not? [inaudible]

JOE HOCKEY:

We are going to have a view on everything. The Security Council - you have got to have a  view on everything.

PRESENTER:

Well, that's good, isn’t it?

JOE HOCKEY:

It is part of the duty of being on the Security Council.

PRESENTER:

Absolutely, we have got to play our role.

JOE HOCKEY:

We do. I am all for playing our role.

PRESENTER:

Okay. Thank you guys. Also, if you see Joseph in the Coldplay mosh pit on Saturday night  just give him a wave.

JOE HOCKEY:

Mate, you are useless. I rang Kochie to see if he could get me tickets. You know what? I got  tickets and then I offered him one. Coldplay is part of the Sunrise family. Fair dinkum. You  are hopeless, I have been here ten years and you can't even get me a ticket to Coldplay. God  help us. I should have rung Kerry Stokes.

PRESENTER:

Exactly, I agree with you. You should have rung him. [inaudible].
