MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS  Senator the Hon. Bob Carr  May 25, 2013

PALESTINIAN REFUGEES IN SYRIA

Foreign Minister Bob Carr today announced $4.6 million to help Palestinian  refugees, including those affected by the conflict in Syria.

Senator Carr announced Australian support during a meeting with the United Nations  Relief and Works Agency’s Commissioner-General Filippo Grandi in Lebanon today  (overnight May 24-25 AEST).

“Australia recognises UNRWA’s  extraordinary efforts in delivering vital health and  relief services to tens of thousands of Palestinian refugee families in Syria, Lebanon  and Jordan,” Senator Carr said.



“Australians are gravely concerned about the ongoing conflict in Syria, now the  largest humanitarian crisis in the world.”

An estimated 235,000 Palestinian refugees have been displaced within Syria, with  53,000 seeking refuge in Lebanon and an additional 6,000 sheltering in Jordan.

Australia will provide $2 million to support the health needs of Palestinian refugees  from Syria who have been displaced and are now sheltering in Lebanon.

The remaining $2.6 million will support education, health and relief services for  Palestinians across the region and is in addition to Australia’s five-year, $90 million  partnership with UNRWA.
