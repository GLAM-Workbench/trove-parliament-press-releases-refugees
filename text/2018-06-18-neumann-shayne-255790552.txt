REFUGEE WEEK 2018

Labor is proud to celebrate Refugee Week running 17-23 June, including United Nations World  Refugee Day on 20 June, as an important opportunity for refugees living in Australia to be seen,  listened to, and valued.

Refugee Week 2018 is a time to celebrate the diversity, contributions, and stories of those who have  sought a safer place to live and now call Australia home.

Labor believes in a compassionate approach to asylum seekers so that genuine refugees can  progress their claims safely, securely, and in a timely way.

According to the UNHCR, there are currently nearly 22.5 million refugees worldwide - over half of  whom are under the age of 18. Australia has a role to play in helping address the global  humanitarian crisis - which is why Labor took a commitment to the last Federal Election to increase  Australia's annual humanitarian intake to 27,000 by 2025.

We must do everything possible to better understand the challenges that face refugees - from the  conflicts or persecution they have fled, to the struggles of integrating and making a life for  themselves in Australia.

Australia is a nation built on migration and we must recognise and celebrate refugees who have  gone on to make invaluable contributions to our society - in our communities, our schools and  universities, in business, and even on the sporting pitch.

This Refugee Week, Labor encourages people to learn more about refugees - including celebrating  the rich diversity of refugees who now call Australia home.
