Senator Lundy refused to confirm facts put to her in relation to Labor’s colossal border protection policy failures.  The questions were asked by Shadow Parliamentary Secretary for Immigration, Senator Michaelia Cash. Senator Lundy refused to confirm the following facts:  Ã¢ÂÂ¢        FACT: that under Gillard Labor more than 2000 people are arriving illegally on boats each month. Ã¢ÂÂ¢        FACT: That 5 years ago under the former Howard Government the illegal arrival of people on boats had effectively been stopped and that there were only 4 people in detention who had arrived by boat.  Senator Lundy also said that she would take Senator Cash to task over the statement made by Senator Cash that in the 2002-2003 Financial Year under the former Howard Government, the Number of Boats that arrived was zero and the Number of People that arrived was zero. “I am not sure what Senator Lundy is taking me to task on”, Senator Cash said.  “As painful as it is for the Government, the former Howard Government’s policies worked.  This is a fact that cannot be disputed.” “I can understand why Senator Lundy refused to confirm the boat arrivals under Labor” Senator Cash said.

“This is a Government that says it wants to stop the boats. Based however on the  fact that 30,408 people have arrived under successive Labor Governments over the  last 5 years, Labor either don’t mean what they say or, they are truly incapable of  securing Australia’s borders.”

“The 30,408 people that have arrived illegally by boat under Labor compares to less  than 300 during the last 6 years of the Howard Government.  That is a 100 fold  increase” Senator Cash said.  Australians want safe and secure borders again and  they will only get this with a change of Government.
