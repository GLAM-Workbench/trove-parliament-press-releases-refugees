SPEECH BY B I L L  HAYDEN M.P. AT GRADUATION C E R E M O N Y

AT T H E  SCHOOL OF M O D E R N  A S I A N  STUDIES, G R I F F I T H

UNIVERSITY, ON S A T U R D A Y , A P R I L  13, 1985

This is an occasion both of pleasure and import for me. It is  pleasurable because of the high regard I have for David Lim, Alan Rix (Who has moved cn to another place which shall be  nameless) and their colleagues here in the School. It is an

occasion of import particularly for me as Minister for Foreign  Affairs and as an active participant all my public life in events  in which the School has an expert interest. This School is one  of those centres which have performed great service in rescuing  Australia from its being a timorous, reluctant and not always

helpful observer of events in our region.

It is held in the highest esteem of my department and me  as being critical, relevant, Objective and industrious. I recall it as the scene last year of a major  productive exchange between specialists from Indonesia and  Australia, including officers of my department. It was so  valuable, in fact, that I am exploring the possibilities of

similar exchanges in the near future which could consider other  countries in the region. It is this kind of valuable service  which has led Senator Susan Ryan, the Minister for Education,  to agree with me that a working party should be set up to

study ways in which an Asian Studies Council could be established  to help centres such as this School. The Council, as you knew,  was proposed by the Fitzgerald Ccnndttee and supported by the  Joint Parliamentary Ccrmittee on Foreign Affairs and

Defence and Asian scholars across Australia.

The timorousness, which I mentioned just new, retarded us in many  ways that we have come to appreciate only relatively recently. With the fixed idea that we were an anomaly in our region, we  kept it at arms length in our arranganents for defence, our trade,

our economic development and our external and internal affairs. This autism still manifests itself, unfortunately —  though not  in quite such obvious ways. The Blainey debate is not so much about  imigraticn f r m  places like Asia as about residual fears about

immigration which sane Australians feel.

Centres of specialised Asian studies have steadily filled the gap  of information about our environment which helped nurture these  fears. They have also provided badly-needed knowledge and expertise  about the revolutionary speed of economic change in the region  which will have enormous significance for us. In the next 15 years,

the gross domestic product of the East Asian group of countries  will be greater than that of North America or the EEC. In cur cwn  immediate area -- in the ASEAN countries, for instance —  the  change and the rate of change have been astonishing. This was the

area which was characterised 30 years ago as the paradigm of the  deprived and disorderly Third World. New, economic progress in the

2.

ASEAN group makes it one of the factors helping to make the  21st Century ’’the age of the Pacific", as Gough Whitlam  forecast a few years ago.

We have been involved in this transformation. Many of the  technocrats and intelligentsia responsible for it were educated  in Australia. We have scores of thousands of settlers from just  about every nation in the Eastern Hemisphere. If the United States  took in refugees frcm Vietnam in the same proportion that Australia  has, for instance, America would now be heme to about a million

and a half Vietnamese. Even so, there were fewer Vietnamese  living here at the busiest time in the exodus iron Indochina  around 1979 and 1980 than those settling here iron Malaysia and  Singapore. This gives an indication of the breadth of range of  the contact between Australia and its neighbours.

We have been involved in the transformation through such  developments as the regional initiative launched by the Prime  Minister in 1983 aimed at developing regional co-operation on  trade. Our trading neighbours had much to complain about concerning

the terms and conditions of trade with Australia, In certain cases,  they still do. But the Prime Minister's trade liberalisation  proposal —  along with other actions we have taken in the field  of trade policy —  shows that he is serious about making "the age  of the Pacific" equitable and neighbourly.

We have been involved in the transformation around us through a direct  aid program which has totalled well over $500 million in the Asian  region since the early 1970s. Our aid activity is not a definitive  factor in Asian economic development, naturally. But it has been  targeted on carefully defined strategic areas such as the development  of public utilities, agriculture and technical and higher education. We have been involved in the transformation of the region by helping

to sustain and enhance the region* s security —  through the Five-Power  defence arrangements, our Defence Co-operation Program and the  ANZUS Treaty.

We are involved in all these ways because we are part of the region.  New I know this is a phrase which causes feet to shuffle at meetings  of Asian specialists all over the place. I use it because it  describes a reality. Australia is not seme kind of artificial

a m  or leg grafted cm to the region. Our sharing in regional  affairs cannot be turned on and off whenever convenience dictates. It cannot be turned on and off according to the colour of cur  skin or an interpretation of our history or as punishment for cur  —  deeds or emissions. Australia is not going to go away frcm here.

This is our heme. Our being here is an inescapable physical fact. Frcm this fact, our foreign policies flow.

It is this fact —  the intimacy and intricacy of our relationship  with our. region —  which has impelled the Government to try to help  those involved in the conflict in Cambodia find a way to end it. Our attempt will continue —  despite the fog created by those who

have a stake in Cambodia staying a killing ground; despite the

3.

expectation among some people that a result in Cambodia will  descend dramatically like the Paraclete just in time for the  6 o'clock TV news; despite the enervated cynicism of those  who have never missed a meal in their lives or heard a gun fired  in anger.

I have made the point before and I shall go cn making it; we have  special reasons for trying to prorate peace in Indochina and we have  special qualifications for it. Our qualifications are that we are  an ally of the United states who yet have constructive and  cordial relations with the Soviet Union and China. We are longÂ­

standing friends of the ASEAN countries and have now established  good working relations with Vietnam. We have been able to discuss  the basis of peace in Cambodia not only with these powers but

also with representatives of those who will make the peace; Prince Sihanouk, Son Sann, Hun Sen. So we have been able to  clarify many of the components, conditions, caveats and complexities  in what those concerned insist should be involved in peace. We  have offered to facilitate the process by which all those involved  can discuss peace together, to the extent of offering a venue and  whatever support is needed. And we have pursued our modest proposal

for peace without giving in to the temptation to tell everybody what i   sort of peace we think everybody should have. If peace should prove  to be as complicated and difficult as I suspect it will be, we should  still be proud of the fact that we have done what we could to bring

it about.

Our special reasons are fairly obvious for supporting the ASEAN  objective that a comprehensive political settlement in Cambodia  should speedily be found. I shall mention a couple of the most important.  One is the degree (present and prospective) to which Vietnam is caning

to rely on Soviet support, the resultant growth in the Soviet presence  in the region and the effect of this growth on the security of the  region. As an active participant in regional affairs, as an active  agent in regional security arrangements and as a nation heavily  dependent on regional trade, Australia would be delinquent if it

ignored this influence of the conflict in Cambodia.

The other important reason for our being interested in the issue is  the plight of the Khmer people themselves. Their trial has continued  without pause or respite since they were dragged into the Vietnam war.  During this time, they have been banbed and massacred, persecuted

and starved, conscripted and exiled. They have been manipulated like  mice in a laboratory in Pol Pot's ghastly social experiments. They  have been invaded and used as pawns in the global chess game. The  Khraers must be among the most miserable people on earth as a result of

these experiences.

As I have said, Australia has the qualifications and the reasons to  try to help them. Can we in all decency refuse to do so? Should we  (like the priest and the Levite in the parable) walk away from them  because —  if we do not —  we might tread on sane political c a m

somewhere? Should we wash our hands of the whole business because  we might even embarrass ourselves? I ask the question because this is  the kind of cowardly nonsense preached by people in recent days. It

4

Â£.

is put about by people who heed the echoes in their firmly closed  minds and ignore the voices of the suffering millions. These are  the people who use weasel words about Cambodia because they want  only the rewards and none of the obligations from our good fortune  and our place in this region. I reject their point of view.

The point I have made is that we are part of the Eastern Hemisphere —   however that relationship may be defined —  and that certain rights  and responsibilities ensue as a result. I have remarked on the  point in general terms because everybody here is familiar with the

particulars.

This point leads to another one, just as important. After all, this  is a kind of initiation ceremony in which we are celebrating the  emergence into the society of a group fully ready and fully able  to make decisions about how the society should operate. I would  hate anybody —  especially young people —  to think that it should operate  only with the values of a calculating machine. No shirt is too young  to be stuffed, when all is said and dene. So ny second major point

is this: Society is no different fran the individuals who make up its sum. Like its individual maibers, no society is an island. We can operate it as we would a profit and Ices account, with the Â·   main chance in our pocket and the trains running on time. But

if that is all it amounts to —  if we do not have idealisn or  principle to guide our society —  it will lose direction and purpose  and the respect of those with whan w  live.

All those feet will start shuffling again if I mention morality  in connexion with the conduct of foreign policy. I Shall do so  anyway because history demonstrates that the society which loses  its moral way in the end loses everything. I am reminded of the

story in which Mussolini's son asked at dinner one day: "What IS fascism, Papa?" and Mussolini foared at him: "Shut up and eatl" And I am comforted by the fact that the story came fran Italy in  the days when laughing at Mussolini was a lethal business.

It is this moral dimension to government and the conduct of foreign  policy that makes it unthinkable that we walk away from the Khmer  people. It is this that makes me take issue with those with hearts  like walnuts (to use Manning Clark's description) who condemn the  thousands who demonstrated their anxiety about nuclear arms on Palm

Sunday. Criticising seme of their argument is one thing. Indeed, I am guilty of it myself because I think the cause of disarmament  is damaged if its workers do no more than wring their hands.

I ranember Peter Garrett in the election saying: "We've got heart, we've got spirit, we've got hope and we've got faith and they're  the most Important qualities of all". Well, that annoyed me because  he was encouraging a lot of good people to believe that disarmament  was an uncomplicated business. Yes, we do need heart and spirit and

hope and faith. But we need ideas too and the means to put them  into practice, otherwise the nuclear powers will laugh at us as a  joke and an irrelevancy.

5.

It means that we have to use what tools we have, however awful  their nature, to break down the international structure of arms. By that I means such things as the joint defence facilities, our  being a source of uranium and even our being an ally of the ,  . United States. All these can be used and have been used to nag and  nudge the powers along the road to such goals as a comprehensive  ban on nuclear testing.

Ihere are people who want a quick fix for disarmament as for  Cambodia. There are some who even demand,it. But the reality,  is that disarmament and peace in Cambodia will be won in a _ series of small steps, each one planned and taken with great /  care lest the whole thing is blown. I vzish it were otherwise,

though I have learned vdth pain that wishes spike no guns. -:’ hi

I use the disarmament issue, like the Cambodian issue, to inplant  and encourage an idea in the minds of those stepping out today -   from this university. I have made two general points. One is  that Australia has grown into a mature, reflective, helpful member  of the community of Eastern Hemisphere nations. The other is that  our successful membership of this community depends to a major  degree on how well we behave in it, as in the wider family of Ã¢ÂÂ  Ã¢ÂÂ  >   nations. The process of our growing up has been enabled by the  knowledge discussed and disseminated by such institutions as this  centre. How we conduct ourselves as a result depends on what  we do with this knowledge. Whether we use it or reject it, it  needs to be considered by the community at large. In other words,

the knowledge gained here needs to be nurtured and it needs to be  promoted.

As Pericles reminded the Athenians, policies are foredoomed to  failure when undertaken undiscussed. >rIhe Athenians, in fact,  considered people who held aloof from public life to be not so much  quiet as useless. So don’t keep to yourselves the ideas and the  values learned and developed here. They may cause inconvenience,

if not angst, in the Government, as both the Cambodian and disarmament  issues have. But, in the end, democracy is immeasurably the poorer  when the people are left to discover their opinions for themselves.
