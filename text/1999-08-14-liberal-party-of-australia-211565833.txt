TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME 
MINISTER

THE HON JOHN HOWARD MP

ADDRESS TO SOUTH AUSTRALIAN 
STATE COUNCIL

HINDLEY PARKROYAL, ADELAIDE

Â

E&OE………………………………………………………………………………

Â

Well, thank you very much Shane for that very kind introd uction.

Â

May I start by congratulating you, Cory, on your re-election 
as the President of the South Australian Division.Â  May I also 
welcome Shane Stone to his first South Australian State Divisional Annual 
Conference as Federal President of the Liberal Party.Â  I am delighted 
that Shane has assumed the Federal Presidency and I record my deep gratitude 
to the tremendous organisational leadership that Tony Staley has played 
during the time that he was President of our Party through some very 
difficult years, but years that were capped with the triumph and the 
happiness of being returned to government in 1996.

Â

My friends, this is the last Conference of the South 
Australian Annual Conference of the South Australian Division, not only 
this century but this millennium.Â  It’s also being held in the 
year that, come December, will mark the 50  th  anniversary 
of the first election of a Liberal Government in Australia, the election 
of the Menzies, Fadden Government in December of 1949.Â  It is therefore 
appropriate for a few moments to reflect on what the Liberal Party of 
Australia has succeeded in achieving, what the Liberal Party of Australia 
has done for this country over the last 50 years.Â  Not only at 
a Commonwealth level but also at a State level.

Â

We have been in power for the great bulk of that 50 
year period but you don’t measure the success of a political party 
or the success of its philosophy by the number of years in office.Â  
There is no point in being in office unless you use office wisely.Â  
The Labor Party was in office between 1972 and 1975 but it can hardly 
be said that they contributed anything but chaos and disaster to the 
leadership of this country during those three years.Â  Mr Keating 
was returned to office in 1993 after running a dishonest, deceitful 
fear campaign against us in the 1993 election.Â  But it was all 
downhill both for him and Australia between 1993 and 1996.

Â

What is a source of tremendous pride and satisfaction 
to us as we reflect upon that 50 years is what Liberal governments have 
contributed to the development of Australia.Â  And if you look back 
over that 50 year period, it can truthfully be said that the great historic 
changes, the great reforms have all been achieved by Liberal governments.Â  
Although proper recognition is due to Arthur Calwell’s contribution 
to post war migration to Australia, it’s also fair to say that the 
great years of post war migration occurred under the Menzies government.Â  
And as I look around this gathering today, I see people who came to 
this country in the early 1950s and contributed magnificently and became 
part and parcel of the Australian community along with those who have 
been born in his country.

Â

It was the Liberal government that dismantled the 
white Australia policy.Â  It was the Liberal government that made 
university education a reality for middle and lower income Australians 
through the Menzies reforms of the 1950s in relation to higher education.Â  
It was the Menzies government that removed the dark stain of sectarianism 
in this country through its provision of government assistance to independent 
schools, a tradition of providing choice in education, that I am very 
proud to say the present government has continued with great enthusiasm 
and great commitment.

Â

It was a Coalition government that brought in great 
social welfare benefits during the 1950s and through the Fraser Government 
into the 1970s.Â  It was a Coalition government under the leadership 
of Malcolm Fraser which extended the hand of friendship to tens of thousands 
of indo Chinese refugees who were fleeing war torn Indo China in the 
1970s.Â  And of course in more contemporary times, it has been a 
Coalition Government in the last three and a half years that has given 
to Australia a sense of economic independence and self respect and self 
reliance and self belief, the like of which I don’t believe it’s 
had at any time in the years that I have been in public life.

Â

So when we look back over that 50 year period, there is an enormous 
amount to be proud of and there is an enormous amount to talk about.Â  
And as Liberals we should be better at claiming our inheritance and 
propounding our history in what we have achieved. Â  And one 
of the reasons that we have been a very successful political movement 
and one of the reasons why the present government is enjoying good levels 
of support in the Australian community is that we have always been able 
to keep a balance.Â  The Liberal Party of Australia has a special 
characteristic amongst center right parties around the world.Â  
The Liberal Party of Australia is the trustee and the custodian of both 
the Liberal tradition in Australian politics as well as the conservative 
tradition.Â  We are not exclusively one or the other.Â  And 
by and large, we have been mostly successful when we have avoided pointless 
debates about which of those two identities we should claim.Â  Because 
we have had a tradition of pioneering great changes and reforms which 
highlight our commitment to individual liberty.Â  And we are engaged 
in one at the moment.Â  We’re not making very much headway with 
it but we will keep trying and that is to uphold the principle of voluntary 
association on the university campuses of Australia through our commitment 
to voluntary student unionism.

Â

We’ve been a party that has been prepared to challenge ingrained 
notions which have been holding the country back.Â  But we have 
also been a party that’s been prepared to stand by institutions a nd 
values and attitudes which have continued to serve this country well.Â  
And part of the genius of the Liberal Party of Australia both in the 
past and in the present has been to act as the true custodian of both 
of those traditions.Â  So it is very important as we come towards 
the end of this year and we reflect upon the 50  th  anniversary 
of the election of the Menzies government, it is important to remember 
what the Liberal Party of Australia has given to this country.Â

Â

And here in South Australia, can I say to this State 
Council how tremendously important the South Australian Federal Members 
and Senators are to the strength and the stability of the Government.Â  
Not only has South Australia on a percentage basis delivered more Members 
in the House of Representatives than any other State in Australia.Â  
And you have done it now in two successive elections.Â  You did 
in 1996 and you did it again in 1998.Â  And given the sort of pressures 
that were about and the challenges that we face, the performance of 
the South Australian Division in October of last year was truly magnificent 
and I thank all of you for the contribution that you made as members 
of the organisation to that achievement.

Â

The membership of South Australians within the Cabinet 
and in other higher positions in the government has never been higher 
and never been of a higher quality.Â  And I want to thank all of 
you very warmly for the contribution and most particularly my Federal 
Parliamentary colleagues for their loyalty and their contribution to 
the strength and the stability of the Government.

Â

Over the last three and a quarter years we have, as 
the Federal President said, we have made a difference.Â  And we 
have made a difference because Australia needed a difference to be made.Â  
We inherited a lot of economic challenges.Â  We turned deficit and 
debt into surplus and stability.Â  If we can succeed in selling 
in the remaining 50 per cent of Telstra we will enter the next century, 
essentially, free of net Commonwealth debt.Â  And I can’t think 
of a better legacy for future generations of Australians.Â  We have 
delivered the lowest interest rates and the lowest inflation and the 
most sustained levels of business investment for 30 years.Â  We 
are seen around the world in a new regard, in a new light, with a new 
respect.Â  We no longer are the anxious outsider knocking on the 
door of the Asian Pacific region seeking admission.Â  We are seen 
as the economic strong man of Asia, a country strong enough to help 
our neighbours and friends in the Asian Pacific region.Â  Without 
in any way compromising the quintessential Australian approach that 
we bring to the conduct of our affairs in that region.Â  We have 
been able to shift the attitude of Indonesia in relation to East Timor.Â  
We have been able to achieve a new balance in our international relations, 
no longer appearing to be obsessed completely to the exclusion of other 
relationships with our relationships with Asia, but rather seeing ourselves 
as occupying a unique intersection, a nation with deep European origins 
and connections and also with the nations of North America, but being 
geographically located in the Asia Pacific region.

Â

I was recently in New York and in all the years that I have been visiting 
the financial community in that, the financial capital of the world, 
I have never found such a knowledge of and respect for and admiration 
for what we have been able to achieve econ omically in this country.Â

Â

We were seen to have stared down the Asian economic 
downturn.Â  It’s a year ago when I addressed this conference I 
probably would have said to you that we had the challenge ahead of ensuring 
that the Asian economic downturn didn’t hurt us too much.Â  I 
never dreamt that I’d be able to come back in a year’s time and 
say so far from it damaging us it is something that we have been able 
to stare down and essentially avoid.

Â

If I’d have spoken to you a year ago of the challenge 
of taxation reform some of you, perhaps all of you, in your quieter 
more reflective moments have wondered whether I’d taken leave of my 
senses, had wondered what the parliamentary party was doing, putting 
a majority of that size on the line in order to secure taxation reform.Â  
And there were many occasions during the election campaign and there 
were some occasions afterwards when it looked as though we mightn’t 
succeed in our objective.Â

Â

But we have been able to succeed in that objective.Â  
And we were able to succeed in that objective for one overwhelming reason, 
in my view, and that is we propounded a positive proposition to the 
Australian people and we couched it in terms of the overall national 
interest.Â  And like any other campaigner in an election campaign 
there are headlines I like and there are headlines I hate.Â  And 
the headline I like most about the last election campaign was a headline 
in one of the newspapers in which after the launch it had the headline: 
Do it for Australia - Howard.Â  And that encapsulated what tax 
reform was all about.Â  It was not about doing it for one or other 
section of the Australian community but in the end the Australian people 
put aside their doubts and their worries and their concerns and they 
returned us because deep down they believed that what we were doing 
was in the long-term national interest.

Â

And I have always believed that you can persuade the 
Australian people to embrace change and reform if you can satisfy two 
criteria.Â  If you can persuade them that it is in the national 
interest, it’s good for Australia and if you can persuade them that 
it is fundamentally fair, that it passes the pub test of being fair 
to the great bulk of the Australian community.

Â

And if you can do that I believe you can sell the 
reform.Â  And that’s whyÂ  we were able to sell taxation reform.Â  
And we are now being seen increasingly by the community as a Government 
that can achieve, a ‘can do’ Government.Â  A Government that 
tackles problems and delivers outcomes.Â  We are dealing with a 
new generation of younger Australians who are less hobbled by ideology 
and carry less grudges about the past and are less missionary in their 
desire to tear down and oppose as perhaps earlier generations.Â  
And they’re interested in outcomes.Â  They are interested in results.Â  
They’re interested in things that work.Â  They are not obsessed 
with ideology and governments that appear to have the capacity to solve 
problems and deliver outcomes are governments that they will support.Â  
And governments that get tied up in ideology and endless argument and 
appear paralysed through and incapacity to solve problems are governments 
in political parties they walk away from.

Â

And that’s why I took tremendous heart the other 
day when I learnt that our unemployment rate had fallen to a 10 year 
low.Â  It is now seven per cent.Â  It was, in fact, I think, 
6.999 per cent and it was rounded up to seven.Â  I am looking forward 
to the day when it drops below 6.9 so they can’t round it up and they 
have to round it down.Â

Â

But youth unemployment has now fallen 5.8 percentage 
points since we came to office in March of 1996.Â  We have the lowest 
number of young people looking for full-time work in this country for 
more than 25 years.Â  And we have now created almost 500,000 new 
jobs since we were elected in March of 1996.Â  And we could have 
done a lot better if the Labor Party had not blocked in the Senate our 
laws dealing with unfair dismissals and the entrenchment of youth wages 
in our industrial relations system.Â Â  And there’s no reason 
why we can’t drive unemployment down even further.Â  There’s 
no reason why we can’t look to the time when they’ll be rounding 
it up from 5.999 per cent to six per cent.Â  And if we could get 
that legislation through the Senate we’d be able to do that.Â  
Because we now have within our grasp, because of the sustained economic 
growth we are enjoying, we now have within our grasp the capacity to 
drive unemployment even lower.Â

Â

Now, I know that it’s, the benefits of lower unemployment are not 
shared completely evenly throughout Australia and there are still pockets 
of Australia which are suffering higher levels of unemployment than 
others.Â  But the overall national picture is st ronger on 
the employment front than it’s been for more than a decade.Â  
And it can grow much more strongly if we are able to get those changes 
through the Senate, if we are able to get further changes in relation 
to industrial relations through the Parliament and if we sustain our 
current very high levels of economic growth.

Â

And the greatest good news for middle Australia from 
this Government is that we have delivered real, improved outcomes in 
terms of their disposable incomes.Â  Because what we have done to 
the great bulk of middle Australia of wage and salary earners is to 
deliver two things to them.Â  And from July the 1  st  next 
year we’ll deliver a third.Â  The two things we have delivered 
to them are real increases in their wages because wage increases have 
gone ahead of price increases over the last three years.Â  And through 
reductions in interest rates we have cut the average mortgage bill in 
Australia by more than $300 a month.Â  And from the 1  st  
of July next year 80 per cent of Australian taxpayers will be on a top 
marginal rate of no more than 30 cents in the dollar.Â

Â

Never forget that 80 per cent of the Australian community, of Australian 
individuals earn less than $50,000 a year.Â  We should never forget 
that.Â  Never ever forget that.Â  Never forget th e reality 
of where the great bulk of middle Australia lies.Â  And 80 per cent 
therefore all of those people earning less than $50,000 a year from 
the 1  st  of July next year will be on a top marginal rate 
of tax of no more than 30 cents in the dollar.Â  Compared in many 
cases now with people being on 43 and 47 cents in the dollar.Â  
And that is one of the great enduring messages of taxation reform.Â  
And that is one element of taxation reform in all the bargaining and 
negotiating over the final form of tax reform that we were never prepared 
to give away or compromise because the real benefit of tax reform to 
be delivered to the great bulk of Australian wage and salary earners 
lies there.Â  And it means that somebody can lift their income from 
$20,000 a year to $50,000 a year without going into a higher taxation 
bracket.Â  And the impact that that will have on incentive for middle 
Australia will be really quite dramatic.

Â

Now, we have come, my friends, a very long way.Â  
We have achieved an enormous amount but in politics you never rest on 
your laurals.Â  You never say, that’s enough.Â  You never 
say, we can have a rest for the next year because we’ve done so much 
over the last three and a quarter years.

Â

We live in a global economy, we can’t turn our backs 
on that.Â  We can’t seal Australia off from the rest of the world, 
we can’t go back to the past more comfortable days when we could pick 
and choose what we accepted into our country on a trading basis.Â  
We have to continue the process of reform.Â  And that’s why we 
are pressing ahead with further industrial relations reform.Â  It’s 
why we are pressing ahead with business tax reform which is the next 
big area of decision taking by the Government.Â  Our goal with business 
tax is to make Australia a more attractive country in which foreigners 
will invest and also making it a more attractive country in which Australians 
will invest.Â

Â

The business tax system will change as a result of 
the reform process.Â  We do need changes to our capital gains tax 
system to make it more attractive for people to invest.Â  We do 
need to nurture a greater element of risk taking and investment capital 
in this country.Â  Clearly, we are looking at possible trade-offs 
between lower rates of company tax paid for in part by the withdrawal 
of existing provisions and concessions in the taxation legislation.Â

Â

We want to do all of these things in a way that delivers 
an outcome that makes Australia a more attractive country in which to 
invest, makes Australia increasingly a desired destination not only 
for current levels of foreign investment but increased levels.Â  
We have nothing to fear from foreign investment in this country.Â  
Foreign investment has meant a great deal to the State of South Australia.Â  
Foreign investment has been a great deal to Australia generally.Â  
Those who denigrate foreign investment don’t understand the history 
of Australia since World War II.Â  And those who denigrate foreign 
investment misunderstand the contribution it has made to the generation 
of jobs in this country.Â

Â

We now live in a world in which capital flows seamlessly across national 
and political borders.Â  And increasingly that seamless flow of 
capital is being followed by the flow of jobs.Â  Twenty years ago, 
even ten years ago, we would never have dreamt that b ecause of 
information technology people could choose almost overnight whether 
they had the jobs in Adelaide or they had the jobs in Hong Kong or in 
Edinburgh.Â  But now as a result of information technology that 
is what is happening.Â  And unless we respond to that and unless 
we create in Australia an investment climate that means that the choice 
between investing in Australia or Hong Kong or Edinburgh is a mutual 
choice, and therefore Australia is in there with a chance of getting 
the investment and getting the jobs we are going to fall behind.Â  
And the strongest message on the Australian economy that I would give 
to you today is that we have achieved an enormous amount but we can’t 
afford in any sense of the word to give up.Â  We can’t afford 
to imagine that we have come far enough and all we have to do is sit 
and all of the benefits of it will come through.

Â

One other thing I want to say to you ladies and gentlemen, 
is that I am delighted to record before this State Council how much 
I have enjoyed working with the Government here in South Australia.Â  
How much I have enjoyed working with John and the Members of his Cabinet 
and of his Ministerial team. It is part and parcel of a Federation that 
from time to time there will be differences between the Federal Government 
and State Governments.Â  We are required, quite properly, to bring 
a national perspective.Â  State Premiers and State Governments are 
required and expected by their electorates to defend and propound the 
particular interests of their State.Â  And that is what John has 
done and has done magnificently in the time that he has been the Premier 
of this State.

Â

But to meet any of the differences that may from time 
to time arise, and they have in the past and they will again in the 
future, and we should be adult and mature enough to understand that.Â  
There has been underpinning all of that a sense of confidence and trust 
in the dealings that I have had with the South Australian Government 
and particularly with your Premier.

Â

I applaud and congratulate him on the success he and 
his colleagues have achieved in finally bringing about that remarkable 
achievement of getting the long term lease of ETSA through the South 
Australian Parliament.Â  It was a truly, it was a great performance 
and I think it has injected a great sense of confidence and hope and 
optimism in Adelaide and in the South Australian community.Â  And 
it rather drives home the point I was making earlier, that in this day 
and age people are interested in outcomes. They are not interested in 
convoluted ideological arguments.Â  They are interested in governments 
that can achieve things, they are interested in governments that can 
deliver results.Â  And delivering results is very much what the 
Government I lead is about.Â  It is very much what the Government 
that John leads is about and it underpins very importantly the partnership 
that exists between the two of us.

Â

I thank all of you for the loyalty and support that 
you have given to me.Â  I thank the organisation in South Australia.Â  
I invite all of you to reflect with a considerable degree of pride and 
satisfaction on the fact that as we celebrate the 50  th  year 
of the election of the first Australian Liberal government in Canberra, 
that we have come together a very long way.Â  We’ve climbed a 
lot of mountains.  We’ve defeated a lot of problems, we’ve brought 
great reforms to the Australian people and if we continue in that vein 
and we remember that legacy we will achieve great things together for 
years to come.

Â

Thank you.

TRANSCRIPT OF THE PR  IME 
MINISTER

THE HON JOHN HOWARD MP

AT THE SOUTH AUSTRALIAN 
STATE COUNCIL

HINDLEY PARKROYAL, ADELAIDE

Â

E&OE………………………………………………………………………………

Â

QUESTION:

Â

Peter Barry - Rural Council.

Â

Sir, the wool industry has probably given more to 
this nation than any other single industry over the period of history 
the nation's developed whether from the colonial times to modern times, 
however as outlined in the McLachlan Taskforce on the wool industry 
it is in trouble.Â  Much of the restructuring will have to be done 
by the industry sir, but there is one area where I believe the Government 
can play a role.Â  It is a small sector that lies in the outback 
Australia that really has no opportunity to restructure in the conventional 
sense.Â  It is limited to producing wool and if we take away these 
people out of this area through the economic circumstances they find 
in we will find it difficult to manage those vast areas that they now 
manage and have managed for well a couple of hundred years.Â  Sir 
would your Government consider favourably helping in the restructure 
of the wool industry in those areas that really have no other avenue 
or opportunity?

Â

PRIME MINISTER:

Â

Well what we are doing is getting industry reaction 
to Ian McLachlan's report which on my first assessment appears to have 
been received very favourable in the industry.Â  It seems to have 
a lot of common sense about it.Â  I met a lot of people from the 
industry in Hamilton at the beginning of last week when I had the first 
experience I've had as Prime Minister indeed in any capacity of opening 
that marvellous sheepvention which is a great gathering of the industry 
in Hamilton in Victoria.Â  And I indicated then that we wanted to 
get the industry's reactions.Â  I won't rule out or rule in the 
proposition that you've put to me.Â  It will be something that when 
we have assessed the reaction of the industry to McLachlan's report 
we will take into account.Â  We understand the difficulty the industry 
is in.Â  Somebody observed to me the other day that for the first 
year in a long time the Russian Army's not buying any new greatcoats 
and it was sort of a metaphor for some of the difficulties that have 
been faced by the Australian wool industry.Â  It's difficult, it's 
driven by market forces around the world over which we have no control.Â  
I understand very deeply the contribution the industry's made to the 
wealth of this country and continues to make.Â  We want to help 
it.Â  We also recognise of course that the great burden of restructuring 
as in any industry has to be carried by the industry.Â  I won't 
rule out what you've put to me, I'll take it on board and it will be 
assessed when we get all the input and responses to Ian's report.

Â

QUESTION:

Â

Prime Minister, the Hindmarsh Island Bridge affair 
has been in the news again this week.Â  Given that this sorry mess 
was foisted on us by Mr Tickner in the previous Labor Government and 
that courts have been finding in favour of the developers, wouldn't 
it be wise if the Federal Government decided to settle out of court 
rather than further lengthy litigation.Â

Â

PRIME MINISTER:

Â

That the Federal Government did what?

Â

QUESTION:

Â

To settle out of court.

Â

PRIME MINISTER:

Â

Settle out of court?

Â

QUESTION:

Â

Rather than another lengthy litigation that will only 
cost taxpayers money.

Â

PRIME MINISTER:

Â

I don't think I'll answer that question on the run.Â  
I haven't spoken to the lawyers.Â  I'll have to…. I won't answer 
that question on the grounds it might intimidate me.Â  I'll plead 
the Fifth Amendment.Â  I'll have to get some advice on that.

Â

QUESTION:

Â

Prime Minister, Lyndsay Graham from the Stuart SEC.Â  
Prime Minister can we anticipate a reduction or a progressive reduction 
in sales tax on motor vehicles as has been done with some electrical 
items?Â  I ask this question not as anybody who's involved in the 
motor industry, although I have a few friends who are.Â  And the 
realisation of the importance of the industry to South Australia.

Â

PRIME MINISTER:

Â

At the moment we don't have such a proposal in mind.Â  
The idea was to bring the top rates down to 22% which is the current 
wholesale sales tax rate for motor cars.Â  We are monitoring the 
motor industry's sales and progress very carefully because we know how 
price sensitive the industry is.Â  It's fair to say that over the 
last few years the industry has done very well.Â  There have been 
record sales and registrations of new vehicles.Â  There has of course 
been an increase in the number of imported vehicles so not all the benefit 
of those increased sales is accrued to the local manufacturers.Â  
The current proposal is to remove the wholesale sales tax and it certainly 
will disappear entirely in July of next year and there are some phased 
arrangements in relation to the credits for import taxing to iron out 
the bumps but Nick Minchin is keeping an eagle eye on it and if he wants 
to alert us to any particular difficulties I'm sure he will.Â  But 
at the moment there's no such proposal.

Â

QUESTION:

Â

Prime Minister you talked about the importance of 
attracting information technology investment into the country.Â  
Before you arrived today this Council overwhelmingly passed a motion 
insisting that the Federal Government revoke its unworkable Internet 
censorship legislation.Â  I'd like to emphasise that we are not 
doing this in the spirit of being anti censorship but we are fearing 
the unworkable nature of the recent legislation.Â  Could I ask you 
to personally look into this issue please and respect the decision of 
the Council.

Â

PRIME MINISTER:

Â

Which Council was that:

Â

QUESTION:

Â

State Council.

Â

PRIME MINISTER:

Â

This Council passed a resolution asking us to revoke 
the Internet censorship legislation?

Â

QUESTION:

Â

That's correct.

Â

PRIME MINISTER:

Â

Yes.

Â

QUESTION:

Â

LAUGHTER

Â

PRIME MINISTER:

Â

Well, I am going to incriminate myself on that one.Â  
I…how many people were at the meeting when it was carried?Â  I 
mean, there’s a very, very powerful argument in favour of the legislation 
we have enacted.Â  I mean, can I say with very great respect that 
the argument being advanced against this is a fairly narrow, technical 
argument and ignores the very deep seated feeling in the Australian 
community that you ought to be…parents ought to be able to exercise 
some kind of control.

Â

QUESTION:

Â

We put up an alternative method of control for parents….

Â

PRIME MINISTER:

Â

You are talking about.Â  I mean, the information 
technology may be right but this technology's.Â  Ah, that's better 
- would you start again?

Â

QUESTION:

Â

Rather than putting up a motion of opposition to the 
legislation outright we proposed an alternative method still allows 
parents to have control over their children’s viewing on the Internet 
and such things.Â  But doesn’t do the damage to the industry that 
the Federal Government’s legislation is set to do.Â  It’s very 
unworkable and despite the fact we would, if we could, do a blanket 
censor such as we do with television and radio.Â  If it’s unworkable 
we shouldn’t do that particularly not if it makes Australia an unattractive 
investment destination.Â

Â

PRIME MINISTER:

Â

Well, I don’t accept that it’s as unworkable as 
the industry is alleging.Â  Any industry that wants something changed 
always says it’s unworkable.Â  I have never heard an industry 
yet come to me and say: we want something that’s eminently workable 
changed.Â  They always say something is very unworkable.Â  We’ll 
have a look at it.

Â

QUESTION:

Â

Thank you.

Â

PRIME MINISTER:

Â

I’ll have a look at your resolution.Â  I wasn’t 
aware of it until you mentioned it but I will have a very careful look 
at it.Â  But I want to make it very clear that we have no intention 
of walking away from the decision we’ve taken to have effective…to 
have an effective capacity for parents and others in this area.Â  
There’s very strong community support for it.Â  It is absolutely 
a matter of elementary logic as far as I am concerned that if something 
can be, it can be a capacity to block something off in relation to television 
there should be an equal capacity to do it in relation to the Internet.Â  
And I just don’t accept that it’s going to cause the mayhem that 
people who have particular interest in the area allege that it will.Â

Â

QUESTION:

Â

Sir, for all your magnificent support for Australia 
you seem to have got on extremely well with the Democrats in getting 
them to do the best for the nation.Â  Are we getting up to developing 
them and getting rid of the ALP?

Â

PRIME MINISTER:

Â

Well, no look, I think what we have done.Â  It’s 
a fair question and let me give it a fair response.Â  The agreements 
that we have been able to advance, achieve with the Democrats in relation 
to taxation and last week in relation to the wording of the preamble 
were very good outcomes for the country.Â  And my attitude as Prime 
Minister is that I will deal with the Australian Democrats and if we 
can reach agreement on something that is good for the country and consistent 
with our philosophy then I will do so.Â  I have found Senator Lees 
to be forthright and honest and decent to deal with.Â  I don’t 
agree with her on a lot of things and she doesn’t agree with me on 
a lot of things.Â  And I don’t think anybody should get carried 
away with notions of, sort of, tectonic shifts in political alignments 
in Australia.Â  I think that would be foolish.Â  But I think 
you have seen a willingness by the Australian Democrats to play themselves 
into the political equation.Â  And, I mean, it’s very interesting 
at the weekend…at the beginning of each weekend I always get a report 
from my Press Secretary as to who is appearing on the three Sunday programmes.Â  
And normally you, sort of, have a couple of us and one of them or perhaps 
one of each.Â  Tomorrow you have got a Liberal and two Democrats 
and nobody from the Labor Party.Â  It’s interesting isn’t it?Â  
I mean, it’s a bit of a metaphor.

Â

QUESTION:

Â

Prime Minister, congratulations again on your excellent 
speech here today and on the week’s legislative work with regard to 
the two referenda coming up.Â  I wanted to ask about the preamble 
and that is it would appear, wouldn’t it, that we are now going to 
have all political parties advocating a ‘yes’ vote for the preamble?Â  
Certainly I’ll be not only voting yes on the republic but yes on the 
preamble.Â  And I wonder then whether your expectation is that, 
you know, all parts of the country will resoundingly achieve a yes outcome 
for the preamble.Â  We’ll see what happens.Â  I expect there 
will also be a yes vote on the other.

Â

PRIME MINISTER:

Â

Well, I think as far as, well I tried cobber but….Baden, I would 
be surprised if anybody were to mount a cre dible argument against 
the preamble.Â  I can’t see how anybody can object to any of the 
sentiments in it.Â  If it’s carried we’ll be putting into the 
Constitution not only the first positive non sort of legalistic reference 
to the indigenous people but a very proper, positive, generous appropriate 
reference to them.Â  And for the life of me I found the reaction 
of some of the indigenous leaders just quite extraordinary and out of 
touch, I think, with the sentiment of a lot of their own people.Â  
I think Senator Ridgeway’s displayed an understanding which is far 
superior to that of many of the other indigenous leaders who seem…who 
lock themselves into one word.Â  Now, if it was good enough for 
another political figure in Australia to show a bit of flexibility on 
one word it ought to be good enough for them to show a little bit of 
flexibility on one word.Â  In the end, it’s the sentiment or the 
thought that counts and not just the way you seek to express it.Â  
So I would encourage everybody to vote for the preamble.Â  On the 
other issue, you are aware of my views and given the fact that it’s 
a free vote within our party, which I think is a very good thing, I 
will leave it at that.Â  I don’t seek at this forum because it’s 
a party forum, I don’t seek to at this stage to re-express my very 
well known view on that subject.Â  But as far as the preamble is 
concerned I would hope everybody would support the preamble and I would 
hope that it would win.Â  But referenda in this country are notoriously 
unpredictable creatures and you never know what happens.Â  But I 
would be very disappointed indeed if the preamble were not to get majority 
support because I think it is a decent honourable uncomplicated non-devious 
attempt to say some basic things about the sort of people we are whatever 
our political views are and whatever our attitudes are on other Constitutional 
arrangements.Â  And I hope people will support it.

QUESTION:

Â

Alex Smith, Young Liberals.Â  Given that I asked 
you a question last year Mr Prime Minister about gun legislation, I 
didn't think I could let the opportunity of asking you a question about 
another difficult and possibly controversial issue slip by this year.Â  
In the last week no doubt everyone would be aware of the disastrous 
figures that were made public about the state of aboriginal health in 
this country at this point in time.Â  Given that we've actually 
been power now for three years I was actually wondering if you could 
outline to State Council some of the initiatives that the Government 
has engaged in to try and rectify this problem.Â  And also if possible 
perhaps give us some indication ….

Â

PRIME MINISTER:

Â

I'm sorry I just can't … I don't know what's wrong 
with the microphone.Â  I can't….

Â

QUESTION:

Â

Should I try without the microphone?

Â

PRIME MINISTER:

Â

Is your question in summary what are we doing for 
aboriginal health?

Â

QUESTION:

Â

Yes, and in addition when we might start seeing some 
results reversing this trend because a lot of governments have spoken 
about trying to fix it in the past but no-one seems to have done so, 
so far.Â  So I think the community would like to see some results 
soon and I'm hoping that our Government will be able to deliver on that.Â

Â

PRIME MINISTER:

Â

Well the answer to that is that we've actually done 
a great deal.Â  We have put a new emphasis in our funding on health. 
There has been, despite some of the press reports, there has been a 
significant improvement in things such as the mortality rate amongst 
children, the infantile mortality rate.Â  We have done a number 
of very basic things in relation to aboriginal health.Â  We have 
achieved through Michael Wooldridge's work as Health Minister, an agreement 
between Commonwealth and State Ministers regarding the benchmarking 
of health outcomes for indigenous people and that won very wide praise 
from all sections of the indigenous community.Â  We have initiated 
a programme of providing basic facilities such as clean running water 
in a number of aboriginal settlements using the Defence Force and that's 
been an extremely successful programme.Â  When I was in the Northern 
Territory last year I announced a programme for the rapid distribution 
through remote communities of a new treatment for trachoma which involved 
taking of pills rather than the smearing of ointment on the eyes which 
has the effect of ensuring that people who might suffer that disease 
adhere more easily to - the problem obviously being in remote communities 
that people are given a prescription and they use it for a short period 
of time and then they get out of the habit or never acquire the habit 
and the treatment's not effective.Â  There's been a new treatment 
that's been devised and we announced a special programme in relation 
to that.Â  We have I think begun to see a number of improvements.Â  
We still have a long way to go.Â  But I think it would be unfair 
of anybody to expect that in three years you would turn around what 
is I guess a long period of time in some cases it's fair to say 150 
to 200 years of indifference to many of the health problems of aboriginal 
people.Â  But we are making progress we are getting more doctors, 
we are getting more paramedics into aboriginal settlements and aboriginal 
communities and we're putting a far greater emphasis on what's being 
achieved in that area.Â  Now we still have a distance to go but 
we've got a Health Minister who's very dedicated and we've got an Aboriginal 
Affairs Minister who's very dedicated and also is himself as is Dr Wooldridge, 
a medical practitioner.Â  Both of them put as I do an enormous emphasis 
on doing something about health education housing and employment and 
that is where the real strides are going to be made as far as the aboriginal 
people are concerned.

[Ends]
