HELPING REFUGEES FEEL AT HOME

The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs,  ,

Mr MacKellar, today praised the generosity of Sydney people

who were offering to host refugee families,

Mr MacKellar said his Department was co-ordinating

offers of help, including offers to help families currently

living in migrant centres,

tl Successful settlement of refugees in Australia

ultimately depends on the goodwill of people within the community,"

Mr MacKellar said,

"Throughout Australia, many hundreds of people, including

dozens in Sydney, have offered to invite refugees into th6ir homes

and otherwise to make them feel at home.

"This enthusiasm has to be channelled to where it will

be most effective.

"For that reason, my Department is in the process of

funding three responsible New South Wales agencies which are

setting up hosting networks,

"Australian families wanting to help smooth the path

for refugees entering the community will be able, through these

agencies,  to act as hosts -- showing newcomers the ropes."

These agencies are the:

,  Anglican Home Mission Counselling Services;

,  Catholic Immigration Office;

,  Committee for Social Responsibility, Uniting Church

of Australia,

At this stage, the agencies are still setting up their

networks and appointing local co-ordinators to cover different

areas of Sydney.

People wanting to help, therefore, should telephone DIEA

officials on Sydney 290-3429 or 290-8430 between 8am-4pm Monday to

Friday.
