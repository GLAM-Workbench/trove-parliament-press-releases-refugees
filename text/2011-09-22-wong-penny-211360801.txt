TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW - CHANNEL NINE NEWS WITH WENDY KINGSTON

SUBJECT:  KEVIN RUDD; IMMIGRATION.

E  & O E - PROOF ONLY



JOURNALIST: We’re joined by Finance Minister Penny Wong. She joins us live in our  Canberra studio this afternoon. Senator, thank you very much for your time.

WONG: Good to be with you.

JOURNALIST: Have you or any other politicians that you know actually been approached  for support by Kevin Rudd? Has he been calling anyone you know?

WONG: This is really an absurd set of propositions being driven by the Opposition. And  that’s been made quite clear today, that this is all about the Opposition trying to promote  their story. Frankly it is absurd, and they ought to be more focused on some of the  important matters in the Parliament, including their position on immigration.

JOURNALIST: It’s interesting though because you’ve got Shayne Neumann coming out,  and he wouldn’t actually deny though if he’d spoken to Kevin Rudd about the leadership. I  mean could we see a leadership challenge if Julia Gillard can’t lift the poll numbers?

WONG: As I said, this is an absurd set of propositions. I’ve also seen reports of a Senator  who was called by Kevin to talk about the football. We’re really getting to a point of  absurdity here.

The issue is an Opposition that’s intent on trying to push this story along, rather than talk  about the position they’re in. Which is opposing very sensible amendments in relation to  asylum seeker management, and instead looking to vote with the Australian Greens. Now  that really is absurd.

JOURNALIST: Can we quickly talk about Kevin Rudd for a moment, he’s come out and  pretty angrily defended his spending on travel as Foreign Minister today. Is it justified, what  he spends, the amount that he actually spends on his trips?

WONG: I would make a couple of points. First, he’s the Foreign Minister, so obviously  foreign ministers have to travel. But if you’re asking a Finance Minister, do I think every  minister has got to be careful with their expenditure, of course I do. That’s my job and that’s  what we would expect of all ministers.

JOURNALIST: Now, Tony Abbott’s called for Julia Gillard to quit over the asylum seeker  issue, he says she needs to resign and do it now. When these amendments are defeated,  and it’s highly likely, where does the Government go to next? What’s the next step forward?  Everybody wants to know, because there’s certainly been a lot of bickering over the last  couple of days.

WONG: First, of course Tony Abbott would say that. But let’s examine what’s occurring  here. The man who claimed he would have a boat phone, the man who claimed he would  adopt a really tough hard line asylum seeker policy, is now proposing to ignore the national  interest and to vote with the Australian Greens. Now, if you ever wanted an example of a  politician who’s prepared to play short-term politics rather than look to the national interest,  then have a look at what Tony Abbott is doing right now, and what he’s seeking to do.

JOURNALIST: Alright, Finance Minister Penny Wong, thank you very much for joining us  this afternoon, we appreciate your time.

WONG: Good to be with you.
