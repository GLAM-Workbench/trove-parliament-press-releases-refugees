D r Saw, fellow members o f your organising committee, advisers, Parliamentary colleagues,

members o f the Chinese Community o f Victoria - and I see several old friends amongst you -

other guests, ladies and gentlemen.

Thank you for your warm welcome. It is a great pleasure to have this opportunity to meet you

again, and speak to you about several matters which I know are important to you, and to the

future o f Australia. *  J

. t

I well remember the last time I attended a similar function with many o f you several years ago.

I enjoyed and valued that evening very much, and I know that I will again this evening.

Could I first o f all congratulate you, and thank you, for the way your community has worked

together for this dinner. I understand it has involved a high degree o f cooperation between

many individuals, and between many different community organisations, and that members o f

well over 30 o f those organisations are here tonight. It is, therefore, in many ways a unique

event. I am very grateful to all concerned, and in particular to D r Saw and his steering

committee. COMMONWEALTH

The Liberal Party that I have the honour to lead is committed to a vision o f Australia where

each and every person has the right to participate fully in our society and to maximise his or

her potential. We are proud of our country's diverse cultural heritage. It has helped to develop

our unique Australian identity. We value highly the contributions o f Australians, o f all

backgrounds, to our national development.

A  Coalition Government will draw strength from that diversity to build a more secure future

for every Australian. We will meet the considerable challenges which exist to introduce

policies which will make Australia more competitive and more economically secure. We are

committed to providing a future o f hope for our children. We have the will and we have the

right policies.

We will need the assistance o f every Australian to achieve that vision.

The Chinese community has been intimately involved in this process o f nation-building from

Australia's very earliest days. We welcome this and welcome the lessons to be had in your

community's example o f industriousness and commitment to the development o f our country.

I f  I can reflect on history for a moment it will illustrate just how important Australia's Chinese

community has been to our nation's development. From the 1820s and 1830s two-way trade

with China was already brisk. Chinese sailors and others wjio had passage on these early  i

trading ships started, settling in Australia around this timJ - amongst our first Chinese

immigrants. From the 1850s many more Chinese came to Australia including those who

participated in the gold-rush, particularly in Victoria.

Since that time, the Chinese community has continued to play a valued role in building

Australia's national life. The contribution your community has made to the development o f

Australia has enriched us all, both economically and culturally.

We are particularly lucky that Australia's Chinese community is itself diverse. This community

has been drawn not just from China, but from Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia,

2

3

Indonesia, Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos as well as many other countries throughout the

region.

Many o f you are second, third and fourth generation Australians. Many are recent settlers -

some o f the fastest growing groups o f Australian immigrants are also Chinese, especially from

Hong Kong, China, Taiwan and Malaysia.

The Coalition recognises and values the important role migrants play, and will continue to

play, in our society. Many are highly educated, highly skilled professionals who have arrived

under the various provisions o f our migration program. They are making an increasing

contribution to the economic development o f our country and often set an example to the rest

o f us o f what can be achieved through dedication, entrepreneurship and hard work. Ethnic

Chinese migrants have been in the forefront in these regards.

4  *

The Coalition’s recognition of Asia’s importance to our future

Australia should be drawing more on the Chinese and other ethnic communities to further our

aspirations in Asia. We are very fortunate to be living on the edge o f the world's fastest

growing and most dynamic economic region but we should be better capitalising on the

opportunities which exist than the Labor Government has done.

The Coalition places the highest foreign policy priority on enhjncing Australia's relations with

Asia. Realising the full potential o f our interaction with tile Asia-Pacific region provides

Australia with an historic challenge. A Coalition Government will be totally committed to

providing the policy framework in which we can meet that goal.

The Liberal Party has a long and proud history o f interaction with Asia. A Coalition

Government will continue that role by implementing policies which will strengthen and deepen

Australia's relationship with its Asian neighbours.

We welcome our growing interaction with the peoples o f our region. Both Australia and Asia

can learn much from each other.

rThe Coalition is committed to developing links and exchanges with our neighbours in the areas o f education, sport, cultural activities, the arts and tourism. We believe that through the expanding number and range o f activities Australia will become even more integrated with the region than it already is today.Asia offers Australian businesses enormous opportunities in terms o f two-way trade and investment. Six o f our top ten trading partners are in Asia. Around sixty percent o f Australia's exports are destined for Asian markets.Yet the Labor Government has not implemented adequate measures to strengthen Australia's trade performance in the region. We are not doing as well in the region as Labor says we are.Australia's share o f East Asian imports has dropped twenty percent in the ten years since 1983 at a time when regional economies are growing strongly. In those ten years we have lost market share in China, Hong Kong, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan and Brunei.Much o f the problem is Labor's lack o f attention to domestic economic reform.A Coalition Government will implement policies to significantly improve Australia's domestic competitiveness. We will focus on a comprehensive program o f domestic micro-economic reform, higher and better quality investment and innovation.Ã¢ÂÂ¢ fThe Coalition will also place priority on actively expanding existing regional markets and developing new ones.I believe Australia should be calling more on the skills and networks o f our ethnic communities to improve our links with the region, particularly our business links. We need to recognise the importance o f community ties in Australia which link us to countries in the region. Together we need to better exploit the considerable opportunities which exist in the Asia-Pacific.4

In particular, the Coalition recognises the important role that overseas Chinese business

networks play in regional commerce and how the Australian Chinese business community can

assist in developing new opportunities for Australia. These networks extend right through the

Asian region and are a key part o f Asian business. Many o f you here tonight will already be

capitalising on these ties.

However, Australian business more generally needs to better recognise the value o f first-hand

knowledge o f business practices and cultural factors in developing trading relationships. The

importance o f familial and friendship ties in doing business in Asia is also not as widely

appreciated as it should be. It is vital then that the Australian private sector better utilises the

value o f these links in doing business with the region.

Im m igration and M ulticultural Affairs

4 I

Australia is a nation built on a diverse range o f cultures, all o f which contribute to the

development o f a distinctively Australian way o f life. We can draw on a heritage that very few

other nations have the privilege o f doing, a heritage from which we can gain strength to meet

the challenges o f the future.

The Coalition in government has a proud history in the field o f immigration and ethnic affairs.

We have overseen the arrival o f immigrants from continental Europe, the Mediterranean,

Eastern Europe, the Middle East and more recently Asia ancj the Pacific, all o f whom have

contributed to the rich diversity o f cultural life in our nation. ^Australians have benefited from

these contributions and w e will continue to benefit.

It was a Liberal Government that effectively abolished the White Australia policy, in 1967.

In government we have played a humanitarian role o f which every Australian should be proud.

It was a Coalition Government which lead Australia to one o f the most compassionate

responses in the world to the Indo-China refugee crisis in the 1970s.

5

6

In the international community Coalition governments have more than honoured their

obligations, resettling many people as they fled from their homes to become refugees. After

such traumatic and distressing experiences Australians can be proud that in our country they

can at last be free and at peace.

Coalition governments were responsible for setting up the first settlement services for migrants

- including English language classes, the Special Broadcasting Service (SBS) and Migrant

Resource Centres. The Coalition set up the Institute o f Multicultural Affairs - the first

government agency to represent multicultural interests.

A Coalition Government will continue this proud role.

The Coalition will maintain its commitment to an ongoing positive immigration program that

has broad community support and that takes full account o f Australia's national interests as  Ã¢ÂÂ   f

well as our international responsibilities.

Humanitarian immigration, family reunion and refugee provisions will remain key components

o f our program, as will business migration. Our longstanding commitment to nonÂ­

discrimination on the basis o f race, ethnicity, nationality, gender or religion will, o f course,

continue.

All Australians, irrespective o f background, have the rigllt to participate fully in our

community. The Liberal Party sees the diversity in our society as a great strength on which

we can call to build a more secure future for our country.

A Coalition Government will be committed to continuing our successful policies for the

provision o f settlement services.

We believe that high priority needs to be given to improved English language programs so that

everyone can participate fully in the life o f the nation. The link between English language and

employment has been clearly illustrated and we remain concerned by the high unemployment

levels in some o f our immigrant communities, particularly amongst young people.

6

7

A Coalition Government will also focus on the special needs o f ethnic aged persons and

women, as well as the special needs o f refugees.

We believe that the Labor Government has not listened closely enough to the community, as

well as to relevant agencies and organisations, on these issues. In Government, the Coalition

will improve the opportunities for community consultation and input to our policy making

process. We value the views o f the many individuals and organisations dedicated to assisting

in these areas.

Small Business

One o f the factors which underpin these regional business networks is the focus and

involvement o f the Chinese community in small business. What is important about this for not

just regional trade, but for Australia, is the significant growth in small business generally as a

contributor to Australia's (and the region's) economy.

Small business is also, importantly, characterised by its sheer diversity with enterprises

stretching across every sector o f Australia's and the region's economy.

The Liberal Party recognises the vital role small business playj in our local communities and

our national economy. Small business is the driving force ofEmployment and grow th in our

economy. Yet the current Government unfairly penalises small businesses. A  change o f

government will make conditions dramatically better for small business.

Every policy the Liberal Party releases between now and the election will be informed by our

special concern for the needs and difficulties o f small business. We believe that every decision

Government takes should be tested for its impact on small business. So much about what the

Liberal Party believes in and stands for is consonant with the needs and aspirations o f small

business.

7

8

Only a Coalition Government can reduce the burden o f excessive regulation and costs on small

business.

We will reduce the complexity o f the fringe benefits tax, reduce the burden o f capital gains tax

for genuine investors and those saving for their retirement, replace Labor's unfair dismissal

provisions with balanced laws and reduce the other costs o f doing business in Australia. We

will attack excessive costs in Australia's transport infrastructure, in particular the ports and

shipping.

A Coalition Government will create an environment which rewards enterprise and initiative.

T he Fam ily

Around eighty percent o f small businesses in Australia are family businesses. The Liberal

Party places the highest value on the family as we recognise that families are the very bedrock

on which our society and our economy are built.

The quality o f life for individual Australians is often crucially dependent on their relationship

with their immediate and extended families.

Families provide vital encouragement and a sense o f security to their members. They also

provide support in times o f trouble - in times o f ill-health, unen ployment and a whole range o f

other difficulties that may happen to all o f us throughout our; lives. Families provide support

as we grow  older and for many are a source o f financial and emotional support in retirement.

The opportunities available to Australia's families will determine the future o f our country.

The Liberal Party believes that governments need to recognise and respond to the changes

which have occurred in attitudes and family life with changes in society. Governments need to

recognise that every area o f national policy-making can impact on the security o f Australian

families.

8

9

The Labor Government has not recognised the vital role o f the family in today's society.

Labor has failed to implement measures which will address the impact on families o f

continuing high unemployment levels and a heavy tax burden. This produces not just

economic hardship, but social and emotional stresses as well.

We are particularly concerned about the rate o f family breakdown which causes pain and

distress to over 40,000 couples every year and over 45,000 children.

The Liberal Party will make restoring the security o f families once again a national priority.

Parents must be able to offer their children and grandchildren a better and more secure future

than was available to them. This is what progress is all about.

Conclusion

4  ÃÂ

Tonight I have touched on four areas that will receive priority from a Coalition Government.

The Coalition will continue to place the highest foreign policy priority on enhancing Australia's

relations with Asia. We will develop greater economic, cultural and educational links with our

neighbours and we will further encourage the utilisation o f existing community networks to

develop business opportunities.

The conditions for small business will be dramatically improved by a Coalition Government.

We are committed to reducing the burden o f excessive regulation and costs on small business.

We recognise the vital role small business plays in the development o f Australia's economy.

A Coalition Government will restore the security o f Australian families. We will implement

policies that will address the impact on families o f economic and social change. W e recognise

that it is the opportunities which are available to Australian families which will determine the

future o f our country.

We are proud that Coalition governments have played a prominent role in establishing a

society in Australia where contributions from a diverse range o f cultures, including in

9

10 Â« r

particular Chinese culture, are recognised and encouraged. We will maintain our commitment

to a positive immigration program and the sensitive provision o f settlement services.

The Liberal Party's vision is o f an Australia where every individual has the opportunity to fulfil

his or her hopes and dreams. We have the policies and we have the commitment to build a

more secure future for all.

Thank you again for arranging this wonderful opportunity to be with you tonight. I look

forward to the next Coalition Government working with your community to build a better

Australia for us all, and for our children and future generations.
