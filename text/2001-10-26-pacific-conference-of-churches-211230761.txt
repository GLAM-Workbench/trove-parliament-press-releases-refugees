REFUGEES 
IN THE PACIFIC

Â

26 October, 2001

Â

JOINT STATEMENT BY THE PACIFIC CONFERENCE OF CHURCHES 
(PCC), PACIFIC DESK OF THE WORLD COUNCIL OF CHURCHES (WCC), PACIFIC 
ISLANDS ASSOCIATION OF NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANISATIONS (PIANGO), PACIFIC 
CONCERNS RESOURCE CENTRE (PCRC), PACIFIC THEOLOGICAL COLLEGE (PTC), 
PACIFIC FOUNDATION FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF WOMEN (PACFAW), FOUNDATION 
OF THE PEOPLES OF THE SOUTH PACIFIC (FSPI), ECUMENICAL CENTRE FOR RESEARCH 
AND ADVOCACY (ECREA), SOUTH PACIFIC ASSOCIATION OF THEOLOGICAL SCHOOLS 
(SPATS).

Â

The issue of accommodating refugees in detention 
centres on some of the small islands in the Pacific for Australian immigration 
screening purposes, is a sensitive issue and concern for the Churches 
and Peoples of the Pacific. The Australian Government refuses to comply 
with the United Nations 1951 Geneva Convention on Refugees, which Australia 
has signed and ratified "to provide asylum to refugees, irrespective 
of their mode of arrival". Instead the Australian government has 
made aid deals with the governments of Nauru and Papua New Guinea, and 
now approaching Fiji and Kiribati without wide national consultation 
on the issue.

Â

The Pacific Conference of Churches together with 
national member churches and Pacific Regional NGOs, on behalf of the 
peoples of the Pacific, voice our concerns over the Australian leadership’s 
denial of their moral and legal obligation to support and protect those 
who flee their own countries because of persecution and violation of 
human rights.

Â

We support the National Council of Churches in Australia 
in appealing to the Australian leadership to exercise her role as a 
democratic state, which upholds human rights principles, to reconsider 
its decision and accommodate refugees within Australia.

Â

We also appeal to Pacific Island Governments to carefully 
consider the long-term impact and consequences of accepting Australian 
aid deals in connection to the refugees. To welcome and accommodate 
Australian refugees for the sake of money will add more problems and 
will have adverse impacts on our communal life as Pacific communities, 
as well as our sovereignty. Pacific island Governments need to focus 
on finding solutions to overcome political, social and economic problems 
at home.

Â

We are also concerned that accepting the Australian 
aid deals will make Pacific Island Governments part of the process that 
solicits money/profits out of trade in human trafficking, and in this 
case the asylum seekers.

Â

We collectively reiterate our stand in safeguarding 
Pacific Islands dignity and refuse to see the Pacific region continuously 
becoming a dumping ground for the benefit of industrialised nations.
