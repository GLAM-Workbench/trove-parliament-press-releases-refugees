The Hon Stephen Smith MP  AUSTRALIAN MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS

Media Release

16 June, 2009

Assistance to Refugees on the Thai-Burma  Border  Australia will provide $1million to improve conditions for refugees living in camps on the  Thai-Burma border.

Australian assistance will be provided through the Thai Burma Border Consortium which  provides food and shelter to the displaced people living in the camps.

These camps represent one of the world’s longest running humanitarian crises. There are  currently 140,000 people in the camps, many of whom have been there for more than two  decades. They are unlikely to be able to return across the border to Burma in the near future.

Australia has provided over $6 million to the Consortium since 2003 through Act for Peace  (formerly the National Council of Churches in Australia).

This assistance to the Consortium is in addition to the $8 million Australia has already  provided this year to improve the living conditions of the Rohingya people living in Burma  and in camps on the Burma-Bangladeshi border.
