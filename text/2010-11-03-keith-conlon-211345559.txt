E&OE……………………….…………………………………………………………………

PRESENTER:

Let’s go straight to the Opposition Leader Tony Abbott, about to hop on a plane in Melbourne and fly over  here to Adelaide and he’ll be going up to Woodside. He joins us right now. Tony Abbott, good morning and  welcome.

TONY ABBOTT:

Morning and nice to be with you.

PRESENTER:

We’ve just heard in our news that there is a forum this morning that you will attend. What’s your  understanding of the purpose of the meeting?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, as far as I’m concerned I’m going up to listen to what locals have got to say about the Government’s  proposal to put 400 asylum seekers in the old army barracks up there. It seems to me that this proposal is  symptomatic of a Government which has completely lost control of our borders, which knows there’s never  going to be an East Timor detention centre and, contrary to pre-election promises, is now opening detention  centres all around the country in disused or underutilised army facilities.

PRESENTER:

Well, on the matter of families in detention where do you stand about that? Do you see the need to have  children in particular in different circumstances?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, it’s interesting that the Howard Government basically got the kids out of detention but the Howard  Government also stopped the boats.

PRESENTER:

We just need to know what your position is on families and kids. Can you give us that?

TONY ABBOTT:

My position is that it’s best not to have families and kids in detention but the best way to do that is to stop  the boats.

PRESENTER:

If they’re here, given that they are here, what is your attitude towards them and where to put them?

TONY ABBOTT:

If you can get them out of detention without, as it were, sending a signal that the welcome mat is out for  people smugglers and their customers of course as the Howard Government did you’d try to do it. But what  you can’t do, let me finish, what you can’t do is just dump people in underutilised military facilities all  around Australia without consultation and what you can’t do is lose control of your borders and that’s what  the Gillard Government has done.

PRESENTER:

Will you be looking to perhaps find out their concerns and working through them or will you remain  opposed to Inverbrackie regardless?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, obviously I’m here to listen and if the public up there at Inverbrackie say that on second thoughts they  quite like the idea, well that will obviously be an interesting message and I’ll take heed of that. But the very  strong impression I’ve got so far is that people there are understandably outraged and the problem is that if  you’ve got out of control borders you are going to see this kind of thing in more and more places right  around Australia. The tragedy of the way the Government has made its decision here is that there wasn’t any  prior consultation. The Prime Minister was in the area the day before, never mentioned this and she cited  subsequently ‘oh, we only made the decision the following day at Cabinet’. I mean, anyone who’s been in a  Cabinet knows that Prime Ministers are under no illusions about the matters that are coming up at Cabinet  the next day. She must have known that Inverbrackie was under consideration and she really owed it to the  people up there to pop the question: how would you feel? And then of course you had Minister Bowen,  rather than go up to Inverbrackie or Woodside, he had a kind of a sanitised consultation 20 kilometres away  at Stirling.

PRESENTER:

After this meeting today where do you expect the issue goes? Where will you take it?

TONY ABBOTT:

What the Coalition wants to do is to have a full parliamentary inquiry into the proposal to have a detention  centre at Inverbrackie Woodside. Now, we tried to get that through the parliament last week. Unfortunately  the Independents and the Greens and Green Independent didn’t support us. I’ll be talking to Jamie Briggs the  local member, I’ll be talking to Scott Morrison in the light of what happens today and it’s possible that we  could have another go in the parliament. Unfortunately the parliament isn’t sitting for another fortnight and  it seems that the Government is very eager to get this work underway and I just think this is the tragedy of a

Government which a) has lost control of our borders, b) is too arrogant to consult with people before it  makes decisions, and c) then rushes like a bull at a gate at matters which would be best solved in other ways.

PRESENTER:

Mr Abbott, before we let you go and catch that plane to come across here the decision by the Reserve Bank  yesterday. What’s your reaction to that?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think the issue is the Government rather than the Reserve Bank. I mean, it’s the Government which has got  its spending out of control and when you’ve got a Government which is spending like a drunken sailor the  Reserve Bank, I think, often feels that it’s got to raise interest rates.

PRESENTER:

But the Reserve Bank in its notes yesterday didn’t mention anything like that. It’s actually talking about  trying to forestall inflation because of the coming commodity boom. Do you accept the Reserve Bank’s  reasoning?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, look, I’m certainly not going to get into an argument with the Reserve Bank because I think the  Reserve Banks does a pretty good job. But I think that what we’ve got at the moment is you’ve got a  Government which is still spending money hand over fist and that obviously tends to pump up the economy  and then you’ve got a Reserve Bank which is trying to dampen down the economy. So you’ve got the  Government with its foot on the accelerator and you’ve got the Reserve Bank with its foot on the brake.  That’s not a good position to be in.

PRESENTER:

Is there a chance that maybe on this you might end up on the same side as the Government or at least in a  bipartisan way want to impose some stronger competition rules on the banks?

TONY ABBOTT:

It’s interesting that when my friend and colleague Joe Hockey made his speech to the Industry Group last  week he was pilloried up hill and down dale by Julia Gillard and Wayne Swan. Now it seems they’re about  to embrace some of his suggestions and, look, if the Government is serious about adopting our suggestion to  outlaw price signalling, if the Government wants to promote more competition between banks in sensible  ways, if the Government wants to have another  inquiry into the post-GFC banking system, sure we’re  happy to support that. But why didn’t the Government accept these suggestions last week? I think if they’d  accepted these suggestions last week they wouldn’t be looking so humiliated today.

PRESENTER:

There’s also the Murray-Darling Basin, but we don’t want you to miss your plane so we much appreciate the  chance to have a talk this morning. Thanks very much.

TONY ABBOTT:

Thanks Tony, thanks Keith. Much appreciated.
