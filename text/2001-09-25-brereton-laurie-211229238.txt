LOOMING HUMANITARIAN CRISIS IN AFGHANISTAN

“Any effective strategy to stop Afghanistan from being used as a terrorist haven must deal with  a  looming  humanitarian  crisis”,  the  Shadow  Minister  for  Foreign  Affairs,  Laurie Brereton, said today.

“While  there  is  a  necessary  focus  on  preparations  for  possible  military  action  against terrorist groups in Afghanistan and those who harbour them, it is vital that the international community work together to prevent a potential human catastrophe.”

“In a report late last week, Oxfam International warned that over the next six months tens of thousands of Afghanis may die from starvation if the United Nations World Food Program is unable to resupply food from outside Afghanistan.”

“During  the  past  twenty-four  hours  the  United  Kingdom  and  Japan  have  pledged  major contributions  of  emergency  aid  to  help  Afghanistan’s  neighbours  deal  with  the  expected influx of refugees.”

“Much more aid will be required, inside and outside Afghanistan, and the whole international community, including Australia, will have to contribute over coming months.”

“It  would  be  a  further  terrible  tragedy  if  the  hunt  for  the  terrorists  were  to  proceed  in  the midst of a humanitarian disaster for tens of thousands of innocent Afghani people -- victims of the Taliban regime.”

Attached for information is a brief on the humanitarian situation in Afghanistan released by Oxfam International.
