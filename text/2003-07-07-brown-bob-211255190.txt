Polite Vietnamese Face Trickery

“The initial labelling by Minister Philip Ruddock of the 54 Vietnamese asylum  seekers now on Christmas Island as economic ‘opportunists’ has seriously prejudiced  their chances of fair assessment,” Greens Senator Bob Brown said today.

“There have been serious human rights abuses in Vietnam in the last few months and  years and the Minister’s pre-judgement was illiterate.

“The boat-people now face the trickery whereby if they tell officials they are fleeing  repression they will be further assessed but if they say they want a job they will be  rejected out of hand. The politeness of the Vietnamese may be their downfall,”  Senator Brown said.
