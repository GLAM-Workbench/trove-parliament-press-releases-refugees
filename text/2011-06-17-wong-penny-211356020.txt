TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW - CHANNEL TEN MORNING NEWS WITH RON WILSON

SUBJECT:  WINTER SLEEPOUT; ANNIVERSARY OF GILLARD GOVERNMENT;  IMMIGRATION; CLIMATE CHANGE.

E  & O E - PROOF ONLY

JOURNALIST: Live in the studio, and here with us again are Finance Minister Penny Wong  and shadow immigration minister Scott Morrison. To both of you, good morning.

WONG: Good morning.

JOURNALIST: Thanks for being in here.

MORRISON: Good to be here.

JOURNALIST: Now, boy, I don’t reckon I’ve seen this much turmoil in Canberra in a single  week in donkeys’ years. Kevin Rudd, of course, at the Vinnie’s sleepout in Melbourne  overnight, could he have been dreaming, Penny, of a return to the Lodge?

WONG: (laughs) I think Kevin’s made very clear he’s very happy being Australia’s Foreign  Minister, and that’s what he’s focused on. And I’m very glad he did the sleepout, it’s a really  good way of reminding us all about the importance of dealing with homelessness, and that’s  why the Government’s got record investments in dealing with that problem.

JOURNALIST: Mind you, it’s almost exactly a year since he was bumped from the  leadership by Julia Gillard, and at that time I can remember Julia Gillard, or Kevin Rudd  saying that he was, had the support of his party. And sure enough he did - they were all  standing behind him as they pushed him out the door. The more we hear these denials, the  more the electorate seems to believe that it’s not exactly what’s going on in Canberra.

WONG: Ron, a year on, obviously we’re going to have a focus on this, and it’s inevitable  that people in your sorts of jobs will ask me questions about things like that. But this date  will come and go. What won’t come and go are the important issues we’ve got to focus on.  And they are things such as the economy, climate change, continuing to ensure we create  jobs just as we’ve created over 700,000 jobs since we came into Government.

JOURNALIST: And the Prime Minister’s position in the top job is not considered one of the  top priorities of the Canberra talk today?

WONG: (laughs) The Prime Minister is the Prime Minister of Australia, and she has the full  support of her Cabinet and the Caucus, and she’s absolutely focused on doing the right  thing for the country. These are tough issues. Issues such as the carbon price, and we’ve  had a discussion about this before, that’s a big reform, it’s a tough reform. Especially in the  face of the relentless Opposition, which I’m sure we’ll see continuing negativity from my left  here -

JOURNALIST: Well, their job is to oppose -

MORRISON: (laughs) ...you’re already in here, there you go -

WONG: (laughs) I’m anticipating that on the basis of past performance -

JOURNALIST: I’ll give him his chance now. Tony Abbott had exactly the same situation  just, well, even weeks ago. He was getting a lot of niggling about how he was holding onto  the job. Is this purely a tactic by the Opposition? How can you drive this forward?

MORRISON: Well, I should also note, Tony was also sleeping out last night, he was over in  North Sydney, and I support the comments Penny made about homelessness. But it would  seem that the people swap in Malaysia isn’t the only people swap that this Government’s  contemplating. And it was a year ago about this time, and that was the last time we saw this  sort of level of disruption, and I think it’s right that people will focus on this.

Particularly when you look at the front page of the Daily Telegraph, and that is a portrait of a  dysfunctional government. That is a portrait of a Foreign Minister and a Prime Minister that  are completely at odds with each other, and we see that in my own portfolio. I mean, Kevin  Rudd has been missing in action on East Timor, on Malaysia, on Papua New Guinea, and  this policy just goes from crisis to crisis. It’s been almost seven weeks now. Seven weeks,  since the big announcement about the people swap, and it still hasn’t landed. And that is an  enormously long time for details to be finalised. And I really think, I think people are getting  pretty fed up with the kneejerk, ill-thought through way that people approach policy in this  Government.

JOURNALIST: I know the politicians want to stick to policy, and they refer to the numbers  that they do, and they’re saying there’s plenty of support there. The talk continually in the  street today, everyone I speak to says: is Julia Gillard done in the top job? I mean, that’s  the talk. What’s the feeling in Canberra? Is her time short?

WONG:   The front page of the Telegraph today, which Scott spoke about, there’s obviously  a fair bit of focus from Scott, and some in media land on body language, people become  experts in body language. It’s a bit like a couple of weeks ago, we were talking about the  body language between Malcolm Turnbull and Tony Abbott, with the very awkward blokey  handshake that they gave each other at the morning tea.

The reality is Julia and Kevin have a professional relationship. I’m a member of the Cabinet;  we have professional working relationships. And we’re very focused on doing what we  should be doing, which is making sure the economy’s running strongly, making sure we do

the right thing on climate change, dealing with these immigration issues - which are tough  problems - and that’s what the Government’s focused on.

MORRISON: But Ron, It’s not just the dysfunction in the Government itself, it’s the  dysfunction that we saw in the Parliament this week. I mean, historically, both houses of  Parliament condemned the Malaysia people swap deal. That’s for a Government motion.

It’s not uncommon for Opposition motions to be defeated by the Government in the  Parliament. That’s fairly common. But when a Government proposal, a Government policy,  is defeated by both houses of Parliament. And there were further votes in the Parliament  which the Government lost yesterday as well when it came to censure issues, only to  survive on technicalities. I think it shows the level of unrest and dysfunctionality we’ve seen  in this minority Government - simply no longer working. And that’s why we’ve consistently  argued, let’s go back to the polls. Let’s get this sorted out, let’s get the stability and certainty  we need. Whether it’s on the carbon tax, whether it’s on immigration issues, or the broader  economy issues. How can the Government -

WONG: I just want to respond to that. I mean the Government has got a lot of legislation  through the Parliament. We are managing the minority Government position in conjunction  with the independents. But I just want to respond to Scott. I’m a Senator. The Government’s  - other than the time when you had the numbers in the Senate and you introduced  WorkChoices with it. The Senate regularly passes motions telling the Government it’s doing  the wrong thing. I’ve been in the Senate nearly nine years -

MORRISON: That doesn’t happen in the House, Penny.

WONG: Just hang on a second. And that’s because -

MORRISON: That’s the point, the Government -

WONG: Hang on a sec -

JOURNALIST: The Government is working against the Parliament in both houses of the  Parliament. How can they continue with this policy? The House is where you form  Government.

WONG: I don’t agree with the way you’ve constructed it Ron, with respect. The Senate  regularly passes motions calling on governments to do something, or condemning  governments. I was there for many motions where the Howard Government was  condemned by the Senate.

MORRISON: How many times did it happen in the House?

WONG: Well just hang on a sec.  And everybody just ignores it. That’s the reality - you just  ignored it in Government. And it is true -

JOURNALIST: You’re telling us the Senate was ignored, I don’t think you can ignore the  Lower House.

MORRISON: You’re going to ignore the Senate and the House.

WONG: If I could finish. The Howard Government completely ignored it. It is true we are a  minority Government, and that’s not news.  I think Australians know that. And there are  occasions when the Government does not have all the votes on every issue in the House of  Representatives.

MORRISON: So why not stop, so why not stop -

WONG: - We know that. So that’s why we have to negotiate bills through just as we have.  And that’s what the important thing is about governing; continuing to get our legislation  through and the Government’s doing it.

MORRISON: When you’ve got both houses of Parliament condemning this deal for a whole  range of reasons. And for the Government to say, we’re not going to listen to the Australian  people, we’re not going to listen to the Australian Parliament, we’re just going to go on  ahead on something that you still cannot finalise after seven weeks. And today we read  issues of return, of non-refoulement are now at issue. Issues of non-refoulement, issues of  papers and identification. Things that were put as key guarantees still are up in the air  almost seven weeks later. And the question is why was this announced seven weeks ago  when all of these human rights and other issues were simply not settled, if not even though  of.



WONG: If I could respond to that. There is a very clear commitment from no one less than  the Prime Minister of Malaysia about respecting the human rights of the people who are  returned under this arrangement.

MORRISON: What does that mean? What does it mean?

WONG: Let me finish Scott, I did listen to you.

MORRISON: No I -

WONG: I listened to you. But I think what is most interesting about the motion that was  passed is that you have Scott Morrison and the Liberal Party voting with the Greens on  asylum seeker policy. Now does anyone out there honestly believe -

MORRISON: Shouldn’t that send you a message?

WONG: Can I just - let me finish, please. Does anybody out there believe that Scott and  Bob Brown believe the same thing about asylum seekers? They do not.  They don’t.

MORRISON: We both think it’s a bad deal.

WONG:  Politics sometimes makes strange bedfellows.  That’s all I can say.

JOURNALIST: I’ve got to ask you another question.  $12 million to promote a carbon tax, a  policy which really doesn’t exist. We know nothing about. Even the independents are now  saying this is just not on. What a disaster again?

WONG: On that, we’ve made clear the final decision on any such campaign would await  agreement within the Multi Party Committee on Climate Change on the policy. And we’re  still working through those negotiations. But just remember, we’re proposing to spend $12  million on explaining to Australians what this will mean. That is less than one-tenth of what  Scott’s party spent on promoting Workchoices.

JOURNALIST: Alright. Scott?

MORRISON: Independents have independently verified that this is a political expenditure  from the Government on advertising.

WONG: One-tenth of what you spent on WorkChoices.

MORRISON: The Independents have said it Penny.

WONG: Come on Scott. You explain to people -

MORRISON:  The Independents have called you out on this -

WONG: You explain to people why $120 million on WorkChoices

MORRISON: $12 million to push your carbon tax. Why don’t we just get the ALP to spend  their own money, we’ll go to an election and we’ll sort it all out.

WONG: Well $120 million on WorkChoices and you’re waxing -

JOURNALIST: WorkChoices -

MORRISON: Pull the WorkChoices out of the (inaudible) Bob Carr may come up, and Bob  Hawke -

WONG: (laughs) I think there’s a few double standards here.

JOURNALIST: I know these are serious topics but we make great television with you two  and we really appreciate you being here. Penny Wong, Scott Morrison thank you very much  again.

MORRISON: Thanks Ron.

WONG: Good to speak with you.
