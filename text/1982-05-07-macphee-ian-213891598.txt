A PERMANENT HOME ÃÂ¡ÃÂÃÂÃÂ THE INDOCHINESE AUSTRALIAN WOMEN'S ASSOCIATION

The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Mr Ian Macphee,today  opened the new premises of the Indochinese-Australian Women's  Association. The building has been made available by the South  Australian Housing Trust.

"The Indochinese-Australian Women's Association has done a  wonderful job in helping refugees to settle in South Australia"  Mr Macphee said.

"It has provided support of all kinds to Indochinese women and  their families.

"The support covers a wide range of activities - from a  children's play group to training courses for volunteers.

"Its services are equally diverse. They include English  conversation classes, ante-natal clinic sessions and a library  service.

"A recent initiative of the Indochinese-Australian Women's  Association is the formation of a youth support group.

"Indochinese adolescents face particular problems in employment,  in adjusting to a new type of society and in making up for  their interrupted schooling.

"Many Indochinese adolescents have arrived in Australia without  their parents or even other close adult relatives.

"For these reasons I am awarding a grant of $1,500 to the  Indochinese-Australian Women's Association for a pilot project  to provide informal education and counselling through its Youth  Support Group.

"The grant is made under the Migrant Project Subsidy Scheme,  which provides "once-only" grants for individual welfare related  projects. .
