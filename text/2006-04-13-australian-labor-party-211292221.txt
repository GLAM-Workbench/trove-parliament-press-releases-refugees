ASYLUM SEEKERS

Australia shouldn’t change our laws just to please Indonesia or any other country.

Reports in today’s press that the Howard Government is changing its policy on  the treatment of asylum seekers are of concern.

When Australia disagrees with Indonesian law, John Howard says it’s a matter  for them - when the Indonesians disagree with our law, Mr Howard changes it.

Mr Howard’s proposal may placate Indonesia in the short term, but in the long  term, if even one person who flees Indonesia is found to be a refugee, Indonesia  will remain unsatisfied with Australia.

Labor’s position is clear: If asylum seekers land in Australia they should be  assessed under Australian law.  If they are found on the high seas escaping an  alleged place of persecution, they should be taken to Christmas Island for  assessment under international law.



Australia must discourage boats from coming here.

Australia must have a Coastguard on patrol, policing our northern waters.

Good fences make good neighbours.
