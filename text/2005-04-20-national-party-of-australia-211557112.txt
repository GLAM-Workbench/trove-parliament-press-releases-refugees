Working With the Community to Help Migrants and  Refugees

20 April 2005

A series of consultations are underway to further improve the support migrants and refugees receive when they settle into  their new community, the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, Peter McGauran, said.

Today in Perth, Minister McGauran met with community groups, residents and stakeholders to discuss the Australian  Government’s new $30 million settlement grants program which commences on 1 July 2006.

‘The community sector plays a vital role in supporting the settlement of newly arrived migrants and refugees in Australia,’  Minister McGauran said.

Today’s session is part of a series of community consultations to be held in each State and Territory to help the  Government develop the best possible support services to assist new arrivals.

‘The new settlement grants program aims to strengthen the involvement of the community sector, allowing for flexible

delivery of settlement services and better targeting of funding to those most in need,’ Minister McGauran said.

‘The enhanced services will be better able to meet the needs of new arrivals and replaces funding previously provided  under the Community Settlement Services Scheme (CSSS) and core funding to Migrant Resource Centres.

‘Migrants and refugees arriving in Australia will have greater access to the services they need, and will become a  contributing part of the Australian community more quickly.

‘A discussion paper on the new grants program was released on 6 April and a final policy paper will be released in August  when the consultations are complete,’ Minister McGauran said.
