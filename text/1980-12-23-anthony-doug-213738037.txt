CHRISTMAS MESSAGE

(From the Acting Prime Minister, the Rt Hon. J . D . Anthony, M.P.)

Christmas is a great family occasion. ...It is a time  for family and friends to get together, and ..reminds us of the  wealth we have in friendship and family ties. The Christmas  festival, centred on the birth of a child., gives us an  opportunity to think again about the central importance of the  family in our society.

The times in which we live., and the pressures we all  feel, subject the family to threats that raise v e r y .real risks  of damage to its structure and its members. .  We cannot simply  take the family for granted..  We cannot simply hope it will

survive for the benefit of its.members and the well-being of  the nation. We must work to preserve and.enhance it.

In times of economic difficulty, the support of a  family becomes of the utmost importance. .While there are strong  grounds for growing confidence in o u r .overall economic future,   we must never forget that there are. Australians facing

difficulties, who need the support and encouragement of their  own families, and of the wider ..community "family".

.  The. Commonwealth Government has a. part to play. We will continue to recognise t h e :importance of the family and  respond to its needs - not just, because of the individual  importance of families and family members, but because family

stability and cohesiveness are the basis of the same qualities  in the nation. .

My wife, joins me in wishing a Happy Christmas to  all, and in the hope that Australians w i l l .remember at this  time our responsibility to.those less favoured than ourselves,.  both here and in other lands, as the nation's fortunes benefit  from the better times I am confident weÂ· can now see ahead of us.
