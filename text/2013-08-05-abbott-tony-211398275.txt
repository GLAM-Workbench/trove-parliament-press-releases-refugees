TONY ABBOTT:

It’s great to be here at JBS Australia. I want to thank John Berry and his team for making myself, Joe Hockey and Teresa Harding,  our candidate for Blair so welcome.

This is very important business. It's one of the largest manufacturing plants in Queensland. It produces 10 per cent of Australia's

processed beef and it is under direct threat from the carbon tax. So, it's very important that we're here. My main message today  though is that this is day one of the federal election campaign and there is a very, very clear choice, a choice between Real

Solutions from the Coalition or more of the same under the Labor Party. We've got positive plans from the Coalition or we've got  division or dysfunction from the Labor Party. If you vote for the Coalition, every Australian should know exactly what you'll get.

You'll get a stronger economy, so that everyone can get ahead, you'll get the carbon tax gone - lock, stock and barrel - we'll get  the Budget back under control, you'll get the infrastructure of the future and you'll get strong border security. That's what you the

people will get from the Coalition should we win the election.

Yesterday, I said that in the end it would be your call who was more fair dinkum in the promises, the commitments, the character  that was put forward to the Australian people. When I say we will get rid of the carbon tax, I am absolutely fair dinkum. When I say

there will be no carbon tax under the government I lead, I am telling the truth. Today, I've written to the head of the Department of  Prime Minister and Cabinet, to say that the first act of an incoming Coalition government, should we win the election, will be to

prepare the carbon tax repeal legislation and this will be the first item of business considered by an incoming parliament. It will be  the first piece of legislation considered by a new parliament should there be a change of Government. Repealing the carbon tax

means that this plant alone will be $5 million a year more competitive. By the time this plant has paid its direct carbon tax costs, by  the time this plant has paid higher electricity and gas prices because of the carbon tax, it's up for $5 billion a year in costs that its

competitors simply don't face. Then of course if this Government gets re-elected there'll be the carbon tax hit on heavy transport  and this plant takes in and puts out some 80 B-doubles a day. So, that's obviously going to be another big carbon tax hit on a

plant like this, on the job security for workers at a plant like this.

So, getting rid of the carbon tax is fundamental to our plan for a stronger economy. You've got to get taxes down, you've got to get  regulation down, and you've got to get productivity up if we're going to have a stronger economy. That's what Australia needs. We

need that strong and prosperous economy, for a safe and secure Australia, that's what the Coalition offers. Now, there have been  some other carbon tax developments today, I'm going to ask Joe to speak to those developments, then Teresa will want to say

something about issues in her electorate and then I suspect that the representatives of JBS Australia would like to say a bit about  the impact of the carbon tax on this business.

Joe?

JOE HOCKEY:

Thanks very much Tony.

Virgin has just announced a full year loss of over $100 million. But they've also identified that in their statement to the Stock

Exchange that they have had a bill of $45 to $50 million for the carbon tax this year which they have been unable to recover  because of weak market conditions. So, the cyclical downside of the carbon tax is coming into play. If you do not have profitable

businesses, then a tax like the carbon tax eventually does cost jobs and in the case of Virgin they have a recovery programme but  the fact of the matter is you cannot keep making Australian business uncompetitive by putting taxes on Australian businesses that

ultimately do compete with the rest of the world and whether it be here at JBS or be it Virgin or a multitude of other companies, the

carbon tax is hitting and only the Coalition is getting rid of the carbon tax. Not the fakery of Kevin Rudd. Kevin Rudd says there's a  new way but he's keeping the carbon tax just under a different name. Kevin Rudd says there's a new way but the debt's going to

keep increasing to $400 billion. Kevin Rudd says there's a new way but the deficit is getting worse. Kevin Rudd says there's a new  way, we're facing 800,000 Australians unemployed.

So, this is a significant issue and everyone knows that the economy is heading in the wrong direction under Labor, they said it

would be performing better, economic growth would be better, unemployment would be lower but it's heading in the opposite  direction. So, if the Reserve Bank tomorrow cuts interest rates, it's not because the economy is doing well, it's because the

economy is deteriorating from the point that people were expecting. Remember the Reserve Bank said that 3 per cent or the  Government said that 3 per cent was emergency levels. So, if the Reserve Bank keeps cutting beyond that, understand this - it's

because they're worried about the Australian economy. If Labor is elected, it's only going to get worse.

TERESA HARDING:

Thanks Tony, Thanks Joe. I’d like to welcome the Leader Tony Abbott and also the Shadow Treasurer Joe Hockey for coming out  to the electorate of Blair today and welcome to my hometown, the city of Ipswich. Today is day one of the campaign and I think it

shows the Coalition's commitment to Blair by coming out here on day one of the campaign. Certainly my campaign is very  energetic. We've had so many supporters call, we’ve had a lot of energy in the campaign locally. So, it's been fantastic for it to

start off. I've been campaigning now for 12 months. Since January I've been knocking on doors nearly every single day. I’ve been  knocking on between 100 and 200 doors every single day in this electorate and the three things that keep being brought up to me

are the cost of living, the boats and veterans' issues. They're the three things that keep up coming over and over again in this  electorate.

By abolishing the carbon tax it will have an immediate effect on the cost of living for all the people living here in Ipswich and in the

Somerset regions. With the boats, people know that Labor don't have a solution. They know that we have a solution to stop the  boats. In regards to veterans' issues I'd like to thank Tony for reaffirming the pledge that the Coalition have for the veterans’

pensions and the military superannuation. It affects around six to seven thousand people in this electorate and if elected I will  continually fight on veterans' issues.

TONY ABBOTT:

John, do you want to say something? Brent, you’re the company spokesman.

BRENT EASTWOOD (JBS AUSTRALIA):

Well on behalf of JBS I'd just like to thank Mr Abbott and Mr Hockey and Mrs Harding for visiting us today. It's a good opportunity

for us to discuss the issues facing both JBS and the meat industry in Australia in general. There’s a lot of issues we’re facing. We  talk to government all the time. We're very reliant on government to address the key issues that affect our industry. Number one is

market access, it’s critical for this country and export focused industry. We're a very low-key industry, but a very important industry  in this country so market access is critical.

The carbon tax is a big issue. We have ten processing facilities in this country so carbon tax is a big issue for us. The red tape

and regulation is very important, but also free trade agreements with Korea, Japan and China are very important to our industry  but the big factor is productivity. Costs are in this country to process livestock are more than double what they are in the US, triple

what they are in Brazil and we export products to the same countries they export to so we need to drive productivity and  innovation in this country in all sectors, but primarily, the meat industry. We need to make our farmers more profitable. At the end

of the day we're very reliant on the farmer in our industry and that's been very difficult for them for years.

So, there's a lot of things we need addressing. We welcome the visitors today and we appreciate the opportunity to push our case  for change and we look forward to working, going forward to doing everything we can on behalf of JBS and the meat industry in

general. So, we appreciate it.

TONY ABBOTT:

Thanks so much Brent. Are there any questions?

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, this firm JBS received $4.4 million earlier this year from the Federal Government to help it reduce its emissions. It was  said and reported in The Land at the time that it would help save the company $1.1 million in energy costs and $790,000 a year in

carbon tax liability. Mr Berry was quoted in The Land at the time as saying it would make a return, it was expected to generate a  return on investment within two years time. It hardly sounds like a business under threat.

12/11/2013 http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/22487/20130903-0148/www.tonyabbott.c...

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I want the meat industry to prosper and flourish in this country and if government does the right thing by our agricultural  sector there is no reason why we cannot have an absolutely dynamic agricultural sector as one of the five pillars on which our

economy is based. The fact remains, the carbon tax is a massive hit on this business. This particular plant alone is paying $5  million a year one way or another already in carbon tax and as the carbon tax goes up and up and up to $38 a tonne and then to

$350 a tonne and these are the government's own figures I'm using. As the carbon tax goes up and up and up, the hit gets bigger  and bigger and bigger and rather than get a government grant to deal with a regulatory burden, wouldn't it be better if there'd been

a government grant to actually help this business improve its core efficiency?

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, how can you be confident that you will be able to repeal the carbon tax when you will likely face a hostile Senate if you  do become Prime Minister following the election?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I don't assume that the Senate will be hostile and in any event, I do assume that whoever gets elected will respect the

mandate that any new government has. Now, if this election is about anything, it is about the carbon tax, it is about who is fair  dinkum in repealing the carbon tax. The Coalition that wants to get rid of it lock, stock and barrel and Mr Rudd who said he's

abolished it, but he's just gone from a fixed tax to a floating tax 12 months early. So, on this issue yet again, Mr Rudd is not being  fair dinkum.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott will the Coalition still rip out the half a billion dollars from the car industry and what impact will that have?

TONY ABBOTT:

The latest car industry rip-off is the $1.8 billion that the Government wants to take out of the car industry with the increase in fringe

benefits tax on everyone who is driving an employer-provided vehicle. Let's not forget that this is a hit on some very average wage  earners. If you're earning $50,000 a year as a charity worker for instance and you've got an employer-provided car, that's a

$1,400 a year hit on you. If you're earning $70,000 a year as a nurse and you've got an employer-provided car that's a $2,000 a  year hit on you. But what this is doing is it's stopping thousands of sales, the motor industry estimates that this $1.8 billion hit from

this Government is going to reduce overall sales by 10 per cent and tragically reduce the sales of Australian-manufactured cars by  20 per cent. So, we're going to get rid of that. This hit on the motor industry just won't happen under the Coalition and if people

want to protect the motor industry, let's protect it from a Government that doesn't get it when it comes to the reality of the  Australian market.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, with respect, you haven't answered my question - are you going to still rip out half a billion dollars and what impact will

that have on the industry?

TONY ABBOTT:

We've made our position on the automotive transformation scheme absolutely crystal clear. By contrast, the current Government  has reneged on almost $1.5 billion worth of commitments to the car industry.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, you say that this business, JBS is under direct threat from the carbon tax, but in fact it's grown over the last 18 months

from processing 2,800 cattle a day to 3,500 cattle a day according to these gentlemen. How can the two things be compatible?

TONY ABBOTT:

What I said was that the carbon tax is a $5 million impost on this particular plant that they just don’t need.

QUESTION:

But it has grown over the last 18 months?

TONY ABBOTT:

Page 3 of 6 Joint Press Conference, Riverview, Queensland > Tony Abbott

12/11/2013 http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/22487/20130903-0148/www.tonyabbott.c...

Surely we want this plant to continue to expand. We want to see more investment and more employment in this plant. At the

moment as we've just heard from the representatives of JBS it costs very much more to process a beast here in Australia than it  does to do so in the United States, let alone in countries like Brazil. So, if we want our food producing sector to continue to

expand, we've got to get rid of unnecessary imposts, unnecessary hits on our competitiveness like this carbon tax.

QUESTION:

Why are you using a misleading $5 million figure when these gentlemen here earlier said their carbon tax bill was $1.8 million a  year?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, they get a bill in a whole host of ways. There's the bill that they pay directly for the carbon tax and there's the bill that they

pay indirectly for the carbon tax through the hit on their power and gas. It's a big, big hit on this plant.

QUESTION:

But don’t upgrades to the energy networks contribute to that indirect hit?

TONY ABBOTT:

According to the Government's own figures, 10 per cent of your power bill and 9 per cent of your gas bill is carbon tax. So, that's  not me saying that, that's the Government saying it and this plant has a massive electricity bill, it has a massive gas bill and then it

has on top of all of that, a $1.8 million direct carbon tax bill. So, this plant is massively impacted by the carbon tax and as Joe has  just explained, Virgin have just lost $100 million or thereabouts and half of that loss is attributable to the $45 million carbon tax bill

that they can't pass on.

QUESTION:

This plant has also, used to have a massive emissions output and with the $4.4 million advance that they have taken from the  Federal Labor Government they've reduced those emissions from 80,000 tonnes a year to 35,000 tonnes a year. Do you welcome

those emissions reductions - over a half?

TONY ABBOTT:

Absolutely, I absolutely welcome a lower emission economy and I will work towards achieving a lower emission economy, but  what I want to do is to reduce our emissions through sensible incentives, not through a great big new tax which clobbers the

economy without necessarily helping the environment.

QUESTION:

Isn't the grant that this company has received a sensible initiative?

TONY ABBOTT:

That's an example of Direct Action. You are, by supporting that grant, if I may say so with respect, you are supporting the  Coalition's Direct Action Policy and opposing the Government's carbon tax policy.

QUESTION:

You said yesterday you wanted to lead an Australia where nobody feels like a stranger. Why is it in your first campaign ad, in

terms of people that feature in that ad, it presents a very Anglo centric vision of Australia?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, it's a very positive ad, I'm delighted the first campaign ad is such a positive ad. We all want to build a better Australia. A  better Australia that builds on our great strengths as a nation and one of our great strengths as a nation is the fact that we have

welcomed to this country people from all corners of the earth who have been happy to join our team, make a contribution and  provide a better future for their children and grandchildren who are, of course, first-class Australians.

QUESTION:

Page 4 of 6 Joint Press Conference, Riverview, Queensland > Tony Abbott

12/11/2013 http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/22487/20130903-0148/www.tonyabbott.c...

Some retail trade figures have flat lined all but locks in a rate cut tomorrow by the RBA it must be a win for mortgage holders and  possibly a small victory for the ALP?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, the trouble with this Government is that is sees everything in terms of politics and nothing in terms of the national interest.

Now, obviously in a situation of a flat lining economy in some respects, not in all respects, but in some respects, lower interest  rates are helpful. But we've got to appreciate, we’ve got to appreciate that if there is a cut tomorrow, and I'll ask Joe to add to this,

if there is a cut tomorrow, that won't be some kind of a win for the Government, it will be a result of the fact that the Reserve Bank  judges that our economy needs a boost and I’ve got to say it's not getting a boost from the policies of this Government. There is

no long-term boost to our economy from a government which has no answers when it comes to lifting productivity and as the  Reserve Bank Governor has said time and time again, in the end it all comes down to productivity, it always does. Joe?

JOE HOCKEY:

Of course, retail sales figures are going to be continuing their flat line, but the fact of the matter is, we should not be in a position

where interest rates are being cut because the economy should be growing faster and that's what the Government said was going  to happen and they got it wrong and they keep getting it wrong, because you do not tax your way to prosperity. So, when you

have left field taxes like FBT changes, like tobacco taxes, when you have the Government chopping and changing policies as the  Governor of the Reserve Bank said, it has a negative impact on consumer and business confidence and the only way you are

going to get business and consumer confidence back, the only way you are going to get retail back is to have a real change at the  next election. Get rid of a lousy government and have a Coalition.

QUESTION:

On that point, if the Australian people do return a hung Parliament at the next election, will the Coalition just stand aside and let

the Labor Party negotiate government?

TONY ABBOTT:

The short answer is yes, because we want to deliver a strong government, we want to deliver a decisive government that gets on  with the job of building a better Australia and that's our business. Our business is a safe and secure Australia built on a strong and

prosperous economy and we will not get that from another hung Parliament. We will not that from another minority government. I  ask people to cast their minds back over the last three years over the betrayals, over the hopeless compromises, over the

abandonment of principle, over the abandonment of commitments that we've seen from this government and say, do you really  want three more years of this? And if the answer is "No! For God's sake, don't give us this", well then you've got to vote for your

Liberal National candidate.

QUESTION:

You would actually rather see a Labor Government than a Coalition minority government?

TONY ABBOTT:

I want to see a strong and stable government and we will never see a strong and stable government from a hung Parliament.  We've had a hung Parliament, we've had a minority government. We've seen what it gives us. In just over three years we've two

Prime Ministers, we've had I think six Small Business Ministers, five Assistant Treasurers, we’ve had four Ministers for  Immigration. They've hardly had a position one week that isn't changed the next week, we’ve had the carbon tax betrayal, we’ve

had the surplus promise betrayal. They said just two weeks ago that everyone who came to Australia illegally by boat was going  to go to PNG, on Friday they told us that no, they're actually going to go to Singleton and Darwin and all these other places, we're

building new detention centres. We don't need more of this. We need a government that you the people can trust. That's why we  need to have a strong and stable majority government and only the Coalition can deliver that.

QUESTION:

Today the Government has pledged another $200 million for the car manufacturing industry given that I don’t think we’re into the

campaign until about 5:30 this afternoon when the Government is really in caretaker mode, can you therefore rule out that if you  win government come 7 September that's not something that you will follow through with, the $200 million. And just secondly on

the debate issue, when Kevin Rudd was challenging you to debates in the last few months you said "name the date, start the  campaign, I'll debate him every day", but now you only want to commit to three - why is that?

TONY ABBOTT:

Page 5 of 6 Joint Press Conference, Riverview, Queensland > Tony Abbott

12/11/2013 http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/22487/20130903-0148/www.tonyabbott.c...

Well, let’s start with debates if I may, Laura, there will be as far as I’m concerned at least three debates and every day I am  debating Mr Rudd. I went out, I did wall to wall radio and television this morning and in every one of those interviews Mr Rudd’s

words were thrown up at me and I was debating Mr Rudd. What Mr Rudd wants to do is effectively have a campaign which is  basically a Canberra Press Gallery bubble with him and me and a few selected journos. I want a people’s campaign, it is the

people’s choice and what I’ll be doing over the next five weeks is traveling the length and breadth of Australia, listening to people  and explaining to them our strong positive plans. I’ll also be pointing out that it will just be more of the same under Labor. So, we

have offered three debates, the first on Sunday and I invite Mr Rudd, I respectfully invite Mr Rudd to accept that invitation to  debate at the National Press Club. Then, two forum style debates - the first where the public get to grill Mr Rudd and myself

separately, and the second where the public get to grill Mr Rudd and myself together. I think that’s a very good way forward.

Now, on the motor industry let me make a couple of observations. First, the Government can’t actually tell us what the $200  million is for and this is typical of this government. They just throw tax payer money around like confetti and I want to say to the

Australian people, I have more respect for your money than to just write blank cheques to industries which let’s face it have been  very good at using tax payers money but haven’t always been that good at maintaining production and jobs despite the use of

taxpayer’s money. Let’s face it, this government has given a lot of money in the last couple of years to the motor industry and told  us that it was going to create jobs when in fact within weeks and months of those announcements jobs have been shed. In the

case of Ford there is going to be an entire closure in just a couple of years’ time. So, that is the first point to make. The  Government cannot tell us what that $200 million is for, it is scandalous, scandalous that they can’t tell us what that $200 million is

for. The next point to make is that $200 million as conscience money for the $1.8 billion hit that they have just put on the industry.  It amounts to a band aid on a bullet wound. That’s what it is. So, final point to make is we won’t go ahead with that $1.8 billion hit

on the motor industry generally and I think that if the motor industry has to choose between the government which is offering a  nebulous $200 million and the Coalition, which is going to take $1.8 billion in unjustifiable tax increases off you. Surely the

opposition is offering a better deal.

QUESTION:

Blair is a pretty marginal seat, there are a few marginal seats here around in this election. Did it play a factor in coming out to JBS  this morning just to put in more personal appearances over more marginal seats?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, partly I think it is because Teresa is such a good candidate. She has worked for quite a few years now in the Department of

Defence. She has got teenage kids who are growing up in this area; she’s got a husband who has served our country in  Afghanistan and elsewhere. I think she is a terrific candidate and I think she is going fight very hard for the people of Blair. She

won’t just be a number; she won’t just be Canberra’s mouth piece in Blair. She will be Blair’s voice in Canberra should she get  elected. I should also say that as far I’m concerned we are taking every seat in Queensland seriously. We are not complacent

about the seats we hold, similarly we want to be competitive in every seat including seats like Blair and I think we certainly are  competitive here because Teresa is such a good candidate. So, you’ll see me again no doubt in Blair but I suspect most

electorates in the great state of Queensland will see me and Joe and Julie and Warren Truss and our other senior people over the  next few weeks.

Now finally, Alex you did ask me about costing’s by way of interjection I suppose but let me take it as a question. Let me pose a

question of my own, when will we see the Government’s costings? Because they haven’t given us any costings. They gave us an  economic update on Friday but what that economic update did was tell us that all the figures they have given us in the Budget just

ten weeks ago were hardly worth the paper they were written on. Every figure this Government has ever put out has turned out to  be wrong. The only real things that we learnt on Friday were that debt is soaring towards $400 billion. Unemployment is marching

towards 800,000 and the budgetary position is deteriorating by $3 billion every single week. Right now Kevin Rudd is continuing to  borrow $50 million a day. You will get our fiscal figures, you will get our own budgetary position in good time before the next

election after the pre-election fiscal outlook statement has been released.

Thanks so much
