Ministerial No 36

INCREASED LIVING ALLOWANCES

The Minister for Education, Senator Garrick, today announced increased

living allowances for adult migrants attending full-time English

hnguage courses.

The increased living allowances will flow from an overall increase in

expenditure on the Adult Migrant Education Program.

Funds for the program in 1977-78 will total $9,663,000, compared with

an expenditure of $8,959,645 in 1976-77.

The increased funds include the cost of the increase in living

allowances and allow for the Adult Migrant Education Program to be

maintained at a similar overall level of activity as in 1976-77.

Senator Garrick said the Adult Migrant Education Program offered a

juange of full-time and part-time courses and classes, including

evening continuation classes and radio, correspondence and television

English language programs.

The new rates of living allowance mean an increase of $9.15 a week for

single students and $16.55 for a married student with a dependent spouse,

bringing the allowances to $45.15 and $76.55 a week respectively.

The allowance for dependent children will rise from $7.00 to $7.50

a week for each child.

These revised rates will apply from early November 1977.

Funds for migrant and multicultural education in schools are provided

mainly through the Schools Commission.

Senator Garrick said the Schools Commission was yet to recommend the

level of funding for these areas in 1978. More than $25 million was

provided to education authorities in the States under the program in

1976-77 and funds for 1977-78 are expected to allow at least a

similar level of activity nationally as in 1976-77.

Another $560,000 has been allocated for the production and supply of

special teaching and learning materials for primary schools with

children from non-English speaking backgrounds and for special

assistance for refugee children.
