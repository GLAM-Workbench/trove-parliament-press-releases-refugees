40 boats as Abbott votes against offshore  processing  Friday, 01 June 2012

Joint media release with Chris Bowen MP - Minister for Immigration and  Citizenship and Jason Clare MP - Minister for Home Affairs, Minister for  Justice and Minister for Defence Materiel.

The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Chris Bowen MP, and Minister for  Home Affairs, Jason Clare MP, said the latest boat arrival today was a direct  consequence of Tony Abbott and the Coalition's destructive negativity.

The boat is the 40th to arrive since Tony Abbott said 'no' to working with the  Government to implement offshore processing and instead chose to play petty  politics on the issue of boat arrivals.

'Tony Abbott's destructive negativity knows no bounds. He criticises the Government  for boat arrivals, and yet yesterday he voted 'no' in the House of Representatives to  block offshore processing legislation,' Mr Bowen said.

'But despite Mr Abbott's 'no' vote, the offshore processing legislation did pass  through to the next stage of consideration. He needs to stop running away from  doing anything constructive on boat arrivals and reverse his vote when the bill  returns to Parliament.'

Mr Clare said it was time for Mr Abbott to act in the national interest and stop saying  'no' to Nauru and Malaysia.

'Working together we can help stop people dying at sea. We can pass legislation to  introduce offshore processing,' Mr Clare said.

'If Mr Abbott is serious about stopping the boats he must stop saying no and pass  our legislation to allow asylum seekers to be processed offshore.'
