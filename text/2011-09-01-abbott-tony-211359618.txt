The Government Must Release Advice on Its Failed  Malaysian People Swap   Posted on Thursday, 1 September 2011



The Prime Minister and Minister Bowen must come clean and release all of the advice they received in relation

to their failed Malaysian people swap.



Earlier this year, the Parliament passed a rare motion in both chambers to condemn the Government’s

Malaysian asylum seeker deal. Yesterday the same deal was rejected by the High Court.



The Government must explain to the Australian people just how they got yet another policy so wrong.

Today we have written to the Prime Minister and the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship asking them to

release all legal and other advice they received in relation to their Malaysian people swap, the recent High

Court case and any other material they relied on to make this arrangement.



It's time for the Prime Minister and Minister Bowen to come clean and explain yet another asylum policy failure.



After the failed East Timor plan and now Malaysia, this Government has lost all remaining credibility in this

area. They just can't get anything right.



This Government has created an extraordinary mess - they must now explain themselves, starting by releasing

all documents and legal advice on this issue.



The Coalition has proven measures to stop the boats, including the reopening of the processing centre on

Nauru and the reintroduction of temporary protection visas.
