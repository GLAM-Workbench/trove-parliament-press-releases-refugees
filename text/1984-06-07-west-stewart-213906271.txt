NATIONAL POPULATION COUNCIL

The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Stewart  West, today announced appointments to a National Population  Council to advise the Government on immigration and ethnic  affairs matters.

"The establishment of the Council is a Labor Party preÂ­ election commitment, which replaces the outdated Australian  Council on Population and Ethnic Affairs which existed under  the former Government," Mr West said.

"The Council has been established to advise and inform the  Government on a number of issues pertinent to the well-being  of our multicultural society, including the relationship  between population growth, immigration intake, and Cur  economy.

"The members of the National Population Council, who will be  appointed for a two year period, have expertise in economic,  industrial, trade union, ethnic and social areas,

"Every State, and the Northern Territory, is represented on  the Council.

"An annual work program will be formulated for the Council,   with priority matters being set from time to time. The  Council will then make certain recommendations to the  Government on their findings," Mr West said.

The Minister said he expected the Council to advise the  Government, amongst other things, on the policy implicÂ­ ations of population trends; the impact on Australia of the  global refugee situation? the provision of counselling and  post-arrival services,  and areas of special need, such as  migrant women. .

Attached is a full list of Chairpersons, and members of the  various committees.
