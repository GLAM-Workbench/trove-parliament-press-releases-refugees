Senator Kerry Nettle

Senator for New South Wales



Release HREOC report now  6th May 04



Senator Kerry Nettle today called on the government to release the leaked Human  Rights and Equal Opportunity report into children in immigration detention  immediately and not hide the findings in budget week.

“The minister does not have to wait until parliament sits to release this report, his only  motive to do so would be to hide these damning findings in the fuss of budget week,”  Senator Nettle said.

“The details of this report must be given the fullest exposure given this government’s  previous attempts to silence or discredit critics.

“Further evidence of human rights abuses only reinforces The Greens’ view that  mandatory detention is a crime and must end.

“The government is violating the Convention on the Rights of the Child.

“The mandatory detention of asylum seekers is inhumane, expensive, and  unnecessary.”

The Greens call for the processing of asylum seekers to occur in open reception  centres before asylum seekers are assisted into the community whilst their claims are  assessed.
