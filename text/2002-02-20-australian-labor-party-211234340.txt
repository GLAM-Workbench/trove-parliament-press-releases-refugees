STATEMENT BY THE LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION THE HON SIMON CREAN MP

AFP evidence on asylum seekers

In my doorstop this morning I accused the Prime Minister of lying about asylum seekers having sabotaged their boat.

My claim was based on a report on ABC Radio’s AM programme this morning.

The transcript from last night’s estimates hearing contains several conflicting testimonies from the Australian Federal Police as to whether it was asylum seekers or people smugglers who disabled the vessel SIEV 4.

Sometime following my doorstop the Australian Federal Police issued a statement correcting the ABC report.

When told that their public statements are wrong or likely to mislead the public, politicians have a duty to immediately correct the public record.

Consequently, I now use this earliest available opportunity to withdraw my statement against the Prime Minister.
