Visit by the UN Special Rapporteur on Contemporary Forms of Racism, Racial Discrimination and Xenophobia

Professor Maurice GlÃÂ¨lÃÂ¨-Ahanhanzo, UN Special Rapporteur on Contemporary Forms of Racism, Racial Discrimination and Xenophobia, will visit Australia from 22 April - 10 May at the invitation of the Australian Government.

Professor GlÃÂ¨lÃÂ¨-Ahanhanzo will undertake an extensive range of meetings and site visits to gain first-hand knowledge of Australia’s approach to addressing racism and xenophobia.  His appointments will include meetings with Federal, State and Local Governments, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander representatives, migrant and refugee community groups and various non-government organisations.

The Special Rapporteur will visit Sydney, Torres Strait Islands, Cairns, Darwin, Alice Springs, Melbourne and Canberra, enabling him to obtain a broad perspective of Australia’s multicultural society and the comprehensive measures the Government has in place to promote and enhance community harmony.

The Australian Government’s invitation for the Special Rapporteur to visit Australia has been a standing one since 1998, and I am pleased that he has been able to accept the invitation to visit this year.  The visit underlines the Government’s commitment to engaging constructively with the Special Rapporteur, and the UN more generally, on our approach to addressing racism and intolerance.
