Is the War on Terror Compatible with Human Rights?: An International  Law Perspective

By Hilary Charlesworth

Paper presented at the Cestan Centre for Human Rights Law Conference  “Human Rights 2003: The Year in Review”  4 December 2003  CUB Malthouse - Melbourne

Abstract:  The paper will consider the particular challenges raised for the international human rights system by the  'war on terror' declared in the wake of the events of 11 September 2001.  Taking an international focus,  it will argue that a human rights framework is critical for the success of such an enterprise and will  examine the practical and legal implications of acting otherwise.



I am delighted to participate in this ‘human rights year in review’ organised by  the Castan Centre.  Like many lawyers of my generation, I was inspired by  both the work and passion of Ron Castan.  He was one of the first Australian  lawyers to really understand the significance of the international human rights  regime.  I only saw Ron Castan in action in court once, during the argument of

the Koowarta case in the High Court in 1982.  I can still recall vividly his lucid  and almost dogged arguments, persuading the bench that the prohibition on  racial discrimination was truly an ‘external affair’.

We are often reminded that we are in the midst of a 'war on terrorism'.  The  declaration of war was made by President Bush just after the devastating  events of 11 September 2001 in the United States and the language of war  has been adopted enthusiastically by many countries, including Australia.

One problem with the vocabulary and imagery of war when we are dealing  with the phenomenon of terrorism is that they imply that it is possible to run a  discrete campaign against terrorism, that it is an enemy that is identifiable and  'out there'.

Use of the idea of war also implies that it is somehow finite -- that we can  expect an end to the war, if not this year, in the foreseeable future.  On the  other hand, given the phenomenon of terrorism, it is clear that we will never  really be able to claim a victory in the war;  and in this sense it is infinite.

It has been pointed out in other contexts that war terminology, such as in the  case of the 'war against drugs', is not particularly helpful in responding to  systemic, complex problems:  it can distort expectations of the outcomes of  the 'war' and it can narrow the range of strategies used in its conduct.

An example of this narrowing is the way that great focus is put on particular  evil individuals as the personification of terrorism, as if their capture or killing  would make the problem go away.

Thus, on the CIA website there is quote from George Tenet:  he asked himself  "What are the threats that keep me awake at night?"

"International terrorism, both on its own and in conjunction with narcotics  traffickers, international criminals and those seeking weapons of mass  destruction. You need go no further than Usama Bin Ladin...." 1

War talk suggests that the best strategy to fight terrorism is military and other  uses of force;  in other words, the idea of a war on terror leads us inevitably  down a particular path and distracts attention from other broader and more  long term solutions.  So, we are seeing in a terrible irony, that the war on Iraq,  justified as a side battle in the war against terrorism, has in fact encouraged  new varieties of terrorism to develop in Iraq.

Clyde Prestowitz, a former aide to President Reagan, recently wrote that:

The US occupation of Iraq has made the country a magnet for anti-American fighters across the globe, who are joining the resistance  forces.  It has also served as the greatest spur to recruitment that al-Qa'ida ever had.  Just as in Vietnam, America has created a threat  where none previously existed.2

But the particular problem with the war on terror that I want to focus on here is  the way that the war is being presented as of such national and international  significance and urgency that it makes talk of human rights seem irrelevant, or  irresponsible or hopelessly idealistic.  I will argue that this is both strategically  and ethically a flawed approach.  As Ronald Dworkin recently noted in the NY  Review of Books,3 the move to sideline human rights in the wake of terrorism

is a common self-inflicted harm of many western nations.  Such policies, he  writes, are ‘not only wrong but shameful’.

It's important to note that terrorism, which I take to mean causing death or  injury to civilians in order to intimidate a population, or to compel a  government or international organisation to act in a particular way,4 is itself a

massive violation of human rights.  By definition terrorists target non-combatants to achieve political or ideological purposes and thus violate the  rights to life and security of innocent people.

Terrorism is a very complex phenomenon and it's crucial to understand this to  be able to work effectively against it.  The word 'terrorism' can very easily be  used in an omnibus way to mean any activities that we do not approve of, or  the activities associated with particular cultures and religions.

For example, UK Prime Minister Tony Blair said, in the wake of the Bali  bombings, that the West was facing a 'monolithic' terrorist threat.  This might

be politically effective rhetoric, but it's dangerously inaccurate.  As the  Oklahoma bombing showed us so dramatically several years ago, terrorism is  a tool of many disaffected groups and terrorists fit no particular profile.

The idea of a monolithic terrorism also plays into problematic stereotypes of  western virtue and oriental menace which themselves can exacerbate the  likelihood of violence.  Failure to understand the complexity of terrorism and  its causes can also lead to a judgment that the protection of human rights is a  minor, marginal issue in the fight against terrorism.

Unfortunately, over the last two years we have had enough experience of  terrorism to be able to detect a trend in the way governments, the world over,  react to this danger.  The tendency is to respond to terrorist acts with a lot of  tough security talk and to devise measures that require considerable  undermining of basic civil liberties and human rights.

The war against terror has allowed the construction of what Joan Fitzpatrick  has called ‘rights-free zones’.5  A classic example is the treatment of people  suspected of terrorism at Guantanamo Bay:  they are treated neither as  criminal suspects, with rights of due process, nor as combatants, with the  rights of prisoners of war.  The detainees are effectively in a type of awful  legal limbo, without any rights at all, dependent solely on the diplomatic  energies of their own country.  They have been treated with ‘impermissible  contempt.’6 Thus, the recent agreement Australia has made with the US about  the treatment of David Hicks and Md Habib presents a motley set of

concessions not as rights but as a case of noblesse oblige on the part of the  US.  The joint press release by the AG and Minister for Foreign Affairs makes  disturbing reading when we know that Hicks and Habib have been subjected  to significant denial of their human rights including tremendous stress and  duress, which may constitute forms of torture at international law.

Many countries have attempted to counter terrorist activities through  legislation.  Like the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom,  Australia has enacted laws that deal with a variety of aspects of terrorism.   Some of these laws have been strongly criticised as being in breach of basic  human rights principles.  But are human rights relevant when we are dealing  with terrorism?

Some anti-terrorist laws and practices have targeted particular groups such as  political activists, asylum seekers, refugees and religious and ethnic  minorities.  The presumption of innocence, the right to privacy and the right to  a fair trial (or indeed any trial at all) have all been regularly breached in the  name of counter-terrorism.  The recent report by the UN Secretary-General’s  Special Representative on Human Rights Defenders, Hina Jilani, shows how  terrorism laws have been used to target human rights groups.

The idea seems that to be that human rights are some kind of fancy optional  extra, and that, in times of crisis, we should forget such frills and allow our  police and security agencies to be able to operate unfettered by the

troublesome guarantees of human rights.

We can also read the revival of the idea of the death penalty as appropriate  for terrorists, a debate encouraged this year by Mr Howard, as part of this  tendency to brush aside human rights in the name of a stern stance on  terrorism.

The irony is that terrorists themselves take a parallel approach to human  rights:  human rights are seen as utterly dispensable in the pursuit of a greater  political goal.  It is true however, that the international human rights regime  has not generated much of value to respond to the violence and  destructiveness of transnational criminal groups such as Al Qaeda.7



I want to suggest that the idea of a war against terrorism in which human  rights are seen as an impediment to effective responses to violence is both  theoretically and practically flawed.  We should be much more conscious of

the human rights implications of steps taken in the name of combating  terrorism.

I think the debate about the human rights implications of the 'war against  terrorism' has become far too quickly polarised into a debate about human  rights versus protecting the security of the civilian population, as if human  rights were somehow inevitably at odds with a nation's security interests.

In fact, the definition of international human rights principles already strike a  balance between the enjoyment of particular freedoms and national security.   The ICCPR, for example, provides that some rights can be limited in very  specific circumstances.  The Covenant refers to 'times of public emergency  which threaten the life of the nation and [which] … is officially proclaimed'.8   There are parallel provisions in all major international and regional human  rights treaties.

The ICCPR makes it clear that the permitted derogations from rights cannot  involve discrimination solely on the ground of race, colour, sex, language,  religion or social origin:  in other words, you could not simply deny a particular  religious group freedom of speech, or movement, or a right to privacy in the  name of protecting security.

The ICCPR also makes clear that there are particular rights from which  derogation is never permitted:  these include the rights to life, to be free from  torture, not to be enslaved, and the right to freedom of thought, conscience

and religion.  It is also clear that the elements of a right to a fair trial must be  respected even during an emergency.  All of the rights contained in the  Convention on the Rights of the Child apply even during times of emergency.9

The Human Rights Committee has adopted a General Comment on article 4  and made clear that 'no declaration of a state of emergency … may be  invoked as justification for a state party to engage itself … in propaganda for  war, or in advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that would constitute  incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence'.10

Mary Robinson, as UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, proposed  criteria for the balancing of human rights protection with the combating of  terrorism.11  Her proposals included the requirement that laws restricting  human rights in a time of emergency would have to:

1. Use precise criteria and  2. Not confer unfettered discretion on those charged with their execution.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The proposals also make clear that any limitations must:

1. Conform to a principle of proportionality  2. Respect the principle of non-discrimination  3. Be compatible with the objects and purposes of human rights treaties and  not impair the essence of any right  4. Be necessary in a democratic society.12

This approach has been endorsed by the UN General Assembly and the  Commission on Human Rights.  Kofi Annan, the UN Secretary-General, has  also published a number of reports on human rights and terrorism.13

Some provisions of the Australian anti-terrorism legislation do not appear to  meet these standards.  Take, for example, the ASIO legislation that was  enacted in June this year, after much debate and controversy.  Although the  draft legislation was held up by the scrutiny of a number of parliamentary  committees, and considerably amended in the process, eventually the

opposition agreed to it, saying that it was the best outcome under the  circumstances.

In essence, the ASIO Act allows ASIO the power to detain people, not who  are suspected of terrorism, but who are thought to have information about  terrorism, for 7 days and to question them for up to 24 hours in that 7 days.   This means that a university researcher could be subject to these laws if they  were foolish enough to have the wrong research interests.

The legislation does not preclude indefinite detention through a series of  rolling warrants.  The law effectively reverses the onus of proof, removes the  right to silence and restricts access to independent legal advice while a  person is in detention (eg ASIO can apply for particular lawyers to be

disallowed). Questioning of a person held by ASIO can begin without a lawyer  being present;  and a lawyer can be removed.

It is true that some of the worst features of the legislation as originally  proposed have been removed from the ASIO legislation.  As George Williams  has said, the earlier drafts would not have been out of place in Pinochet's  Chile.  In the final version, retired judges are used to oversee the process;   The law will lapse after 3 years.  However, from a human rights perspective,  the law is still problematic.

George Williams has called the law:  'an extraordinary law for an extraordinary  time.  It can be justified only as a temporary response to the threat of  terrorism'.  My concern is that this law will in fact have a longer life and impact  and set a precedent for scaling back human rights.  The war on terror as  depicted by our politicians can never end and thus these laws will always  appear necessary.

The bi partisan support for the flawed ASIO legislation indicates to me the  importance of having a set of human rights standards against which  governmental action in relation to terrorism can be measured.  As we have no  bill of rights, no such set of standards is available in Australian law to measure  counter-terrorism measures.  The international human rights regime can thus  provide a useful framework for assessing Australian law.

Apart from the issue of principle, it's worth noting that there are some quite  practical pitfalls in assuming that, when the chips are down, security concerns  should have priority over human rights.  We know from the United States  experience that a certain insouciance about truth, justice and human rights  can develop in agencies responsible for security.  Indeed the secret federal  court that approves spying on suspected terrorists in the US found last year  that the Justice Department and FBI officials supplied erroneous information  to the court in more than 75 applications for search warrants and wire taps.14

An alternative framework to consider in dealing with acts of terrorism is  international criminal law.  The atrocities of 11 September 2001 and the 2002  Bali bombings both meet the international definition of a crime against  humanity:  they were both large scale attacks directed at civilian populations.   This gives another source of redress for these terrible acts:  international  criminal law requires that all states assist in the prosecution of suspects.  The  International Criminal Court would provide an appropriate forum for the  prosecution of those involved if no relevant national legal system is willing or  able to conduct a proper trial.  The strategic value of the continuing US  opposition to the ICC is thus very hard to understand.

I do not want to suggest that governments should take no special measures to  counter terrorism.  Targeted measures proportional to the danger at hand may  be of considerable value.  My point is rather that these measures require a  human rights framework.

As the former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary Robinson, has  argued:  'An effective strategy to counter terrorism should use human rights  as its unifying framework. … The essence of human rights is that human life  and dignity must not be compromised and that certain acts, whether carried  out by State or non-State actors, are never justified no matter what the ends.   International human rights and humanitarian law define the boundaries of  permissible political and military conduct.'15

These principles apply with equal force to those who seek to achieve political  ends through inducing terror in the civilian population and those who are  engaged in counter-terrorism operations.  Just as no political or religious or  philosophical cause can justify violating the right to life of civilians, no  response to terrorism can justify violating fundamental human rights.

What many quick governmental reactions to recent terrorist incidents do not  seem to realise is that 'building a durable global human rights culture, by  asserting the value and worth of every human being, is essential if terrorism is  to be eliminated'.16  I do not see this as ‘legal idealism’ but rather as politically  crucial to creating an effective response to the phenomenon of terrorism.

Rather than rushing to appear to appear draconian in the face of terror, it's  worth taking some time to consider the most effective long-term strategies.  At  the end of the day, true human security depends on broadening respect for  human rights, rather than treating human rights as dispensable when the  going gets tough.

For these reasons, I would like to see the rhetoric of the 'war on terror'  abandoned:  the idea of a war suggests that it's possible to use lethal force on  the enemy regardless of their personal involvement with violence and it  justifies action on the basis of feared or anticipated harm;  it implies that harm

to civilians is justifiable, if it assists the prosecution of the war; it also allows  fair requirements of evidence and proof to be watered down.17

We need to think much more seriously about long term strategies and the  causes of terrorism - talk of the ‘war on terror’ gives the impression of strong  action while in fact exacerbating the phenomenon it seeks to eradicate.  For  the short term, however, the most useful approach to terrorism, I want to  suggest, would be one based on the rule of law and respect for human rights.



As Kofi Annan said in August ‘If we compromise on human rights in seeking to  fight terrorism, we hand terrorists a victory they cannot achieve on their  own.’18
