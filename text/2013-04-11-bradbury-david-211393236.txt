INTERVIEW WITH KIERAN GILBERT

SKY NEWS AM AGENDA

11 APRIL 2013

SUBJECTS: Asylum seekers, high speed rail, NBN, drugs in sport,  China

HOST:

Joining me on the program to discuss this and other matters of the day,  the Assistant Treasurer David Bradbury at the Sky News Centre and in  Sydney we've got the Shadow Assistant Treasurer, Senator Mathias  Cormann. Gentlemen, good morning.

BRADBURY:

Good morning Kieran.

HOST:

David Bradbury, first to you. The warning from the Sri Lankan authorities  is very, very clear. The High Commissioner is saying send the group back  immediately. Is it time the Government adopted Coalition policy and did  just that?

BRADBURY:

The policy that we have been implementing in relation to Sri Lanka has  been, after having undertaken preliminary reviews of whether or not  someone has a valid claim to make out, sending them back and indeed,

as Minister Clare has pointed out in the introduction there, about a  thousand Sri Lankans have been sent back very promptly because it was  found that they did not have a basis for making an asylum claim. So I  think that what we've done in the past is exactly what we will be doing in  this case. Obviously what makes this one stand out a little bit is the fact  that the boat did get as close to the mainland as it did. Of course, this is  not the first time this has happened - certainly it happened many, many,  many times under the former government - but of course, regardless of  where the boats are, the Australian Government will be taking the prompt  action, particularly in relation to those Sri Lankan individuals that may not  be having a legitimate claim.

HOST:

Senator Cormann, the number of arrivals has slowed. I want to play you a  comment from Jason Clare before I come to you; Jason Clare pointing out  this morning on the Seven Network that the indications in interviews with  those on board are that they wanted to get to the New Zealand mainland,  not to Australia, hence their arrival so far south of the mainland. Let's  play you Jason Clare, the Minister for Customs and Border Protection.  [Audio]

HOST:

Senator Cormann, that would indicate that this is an anomaly and as the  Government has argued, the boat numbers have slowed since their policy  of repatriating the Sri Lankans has stepped up since August last year.

CORMANN:

Minister Clare is asking himself the wrong question. The question is not  why this boat went to Geraldton. The question is why could this illegal  boat arrival get to Geraldton undetected? It doesn't matter if they wanted  to go to New Zealand or where they wanted to go. This is a boat that  came within 400 kilometres of Perth. I mean, the equivalent for people in  Sydney is an illegal, undetected boat arrival in Port Macquarie. It's just  completely unbelievable. This Government has lost control of our borders,  and this proposition that the numbers have gone down, we've had more  than 1,000 illegal boat arrivals over the last nine days. I mean, this is the  Government that has cut the resources of Customs and the Navy, they've  dismantled a highly successful border protection policy framework from  the Howard Government. The results are there for all to see and at the  next election, Labor should have to pay the price for this.

HOST:

David Bradbury, that is a concern, is it not? I know the Government's  announced a review, but this boat reached the mainland and as the Sri

Lankan Navy said itself that this will encourage others to do the same.  How much worry is it that this vessel could make it to pretty much within  swimming distance of the coast?

BRADBURY:

I just remind Mathias, who points out that the Howard Government got  the matters under control but didn't make the point that, I think it was 19  boats, made it to the mainland - 19 boats made it to the mainland, and  indeed I remember very well, turning on the TV several years ago and  finding out that a group of asylum seekers first presented to a fish and  chip shop. Nobody had detected them, not only to the mainland but they  got out of the boat and walked to the fish and chip shop! So we can go  back and talk about all these things, but the point that the Minister is  making is that there are measures that have been put in place that have  seen a dramatic reduction in the number of people coming from Sri  Lanka. That is on the record, and what it does appear in this instance is  that so effective have those measures been in relation to the Sri Lankan  pipeline that Sri Lankans in this case, in fact, were heading to New  Zealand, not Australia. Look, in the end, we say that the most significant  thing that we still need to do is we need to put in place the Malaysian  arrangement. Of the Houston Panel recommendations, that is the one big  outstanding matter. We call upon -

HOST:

There's also an outstanding matter in terms of excising the mainland from  the migration zone.

CORMANN:

Indeed.

HOST:

It's passed through the House of Representatives but hasn't passed the  Senate, therefore this group won't be able to be sent to Nauru or Manus  Island for processing, David Bradbury?

BRADBURY:

Well let's just wait and see what does happen. They may well, if they  don't have a claim to be made, dealt with in the same way as those other  Sri Lankans that have previously sought to come through the same  pipeline, but in terms of that legislation, we are committed to passing that  legislation, that is something that has passed through the House of  Representatives and is now before the Senate. Can I make the point that  there are a number of key elements from the Houston Panel that the

Opposition has thumbed its nose at, one of course is the commitment to  increase the humanitarian intake to 20,000 in order to take the pressure  off back in those areas, to make sure that people are coming through the  right channels. But significantly, and most importantly, we have always  said that the most significant thing we can do to deter people is put in  place the Malaysian arrangement, that we can send a very clear message  that we will take people back, at least part way of the journey -

HOST:

Okay, I'll just go to Senator Cormann there. Senator Cormann, you can,  but I just wanted to ask you about the point that the Government's made  repeatedly over the last couple of days. There have been two boats  arrived or reached the mainland in five years, there were 19 that reached  the mainland in the Howard years, so doesn't that make the Coalition's  attack on the border, on the customs surveillance and so on ring a little  hollow?

CORMANN:

Obviously during the Howard Government years we did what needed to  be done to ramp up border security. We increased resources to Customs,  we increased resources to the Navy, we put in place a strong border  protection policy framework and of course, towards the end of the Howard  Government the problem was largely solved. Now, I mean, the comments  that David Bradbury just made are completely disingenuous. Firstly, as  far as the Malaysian people swap deal is concerned, that was to send 800  illegal boat arrivals to New Zealand, ah, to Malaysia, in order to take  4,000 back. Now just over nine days we've had more than 1,000 arrive,  just over the past nine days.

BRADBURY:

But why won't you support it?

CORMANN:

That would have been - well because it doesn't work -

BRADBURY:

Well how do you know?

CORMANN:

And because Malaysia hasn't signed the relevant convention, soâ€¦ and the  next point of course is that Labor is not serious about border protection.  They've had this legislation languishing in the Senate for weeks now to

excise the Australian mainland from the migration zone, they haven't  done anything to progress it in a timely fashion. Instead we wasted weeks  on an attack on the freedom of the press.

HOST:

Senator Cormann, I want to ask you another point though. There must be  real concerns within the Coalition as to whether anything will stop the  boats, even if you win Government as many expect you will in  September. You've talked up a big game, but given that the flow, the on-rush of vessels that we've seen, are you concerned that nothing that you  will do will be able to stop what is enticing these people to come to  Australia?

CORMANN:

We will stop the boats, we've done it before and we would be serious  about it, unlike the current Government. We will ensure that whatever  needs to be done to stop the boats will be done, including, of course, not  only having a serious commitment to offshore processing, temporary  protection visas as well as turning the boats around when it's safe to do  so. But in order to turn the boats around, when it's safe to do so, you've  got to be able to detect them. This incompetent Government doesn't even  know when the boats get here until they get to Geraldton.

BRADBURY:

Kieran, if I could just respond to that. Mathias, just a moment ago, in  relation to the Malaysian arrangement said, we don't support the  Malaysian arrangement because Malaysia hasn't signed the Convention,  yet he's talking about turning the boats around. Tell me Mathias, which  countries are you going to turn them around to? Which countries that are  signatories to the Convention? What hypocrisy if you're talking about  sending them back to Indonesia or sending them back to Malaysia, to  countries that have not signed the Convention. This is absolute hypocrisy.  You can support Malaysia and let us get on with the job.

CORMANN:

Governments have done it in the past [inaudible]

BRADBURY:

And you're saying we should only send them to countries that have  signed the Convention.

HOST:

Okay, let's take a break we'll be right back, stay with us. [BREAK]

HOST:

This is AM Agenda, thank you very much for your company. With me this  morning, the Shadow Assistant Treasurer Mathias Cormann and the  Assistant Treasurer, David Bradbury. Gentlemen I want to talk about  high-speed rail. The Government's going to be releasing today this  feasibility study into the prospect. Now it looks very expensive - $50  billion from Sydney to Melbourne, built by just after 2030 so it's a long  timeframe as well, but in the end the net economic benefit would be  $2.30 according to this feasibility study, for every dollar spent on the  high-speed rail. David Bradbury, is it ever going to happen?

BRADBURY:

Well look, I think that if people do what has always occurred in the past  and that is to put this in the too-hard basket, then the answer is it'll never  happen, but I think people have to be realistic about what can be  achieved. I think that we can recognise that this would be a very  significant project that would deliver a real productivity gain to the  national economy, but it is also a project that would take a considerable  period of time. It is a monumental task and it is one that would need to  be worked through. I think the real question here is, first and foremost  let's wait for the Minister to release the detail of the report, but the real  question here is whether or not we allow this to be discarded and put  back in the too-hard basket, or whether or not we find a way to progress  the discussion so we can find a way to explore the benefits that this could  have to the national economy.

HOST:

What do you think Senator Cormann? It would take a bit of heat off other  areas of infrastructure, and according to the report also it forecasts and  economic return.

CORMANN:

Well look, all of us, we want to see a world-class infrastructure for  Australia. The problem though with this Government is that Labor is  always good at the grand promises and raising expectations and putting  billions and billions of taxpayers' money on the line - we're already  heading for $300 billion of Government debt - this Government will never  be able to deliver anything like this sort of project because if you look at  their track record in the past they've always overpromised and not  delivered. Now, as far as we're concerned, we've got a realistic plan for  infrastructure. We've already committed $1.5 billion to the WestConnex  project in Sydney, $1.5 billion to the East-West Link in Melbourne, $5.6

billion to the duplication of the Pacific Highway. We'll be making some  announcements about the funding for infrastructure in my home state of  Western Australia closer to the election, so we've got realistic, achievable  projects on the table which will be underway within 12 months of the  election of a Coalition Government.

HOST:

To the NBN, a CSIRO expert in the Fairfax press this morning, Senator  Cormann, says there are technologies already coming into the  marketplace that will push the limits of the Coalition's bandwidth capacity.  Is there a risk it's going to be obsolete, your alternative, before its even  done?

CORMANN:

That is a risk of Labor's NBN project of course, because Labor's pie in the  sky speeds will not be available for decades on the current roll out  timetables. What we've announced earlier this week is a plan for faster,  better broadband sooner, of course in a more affordable way for  taxpayers and for the end consumer. Under our plan, people will be able  to benefit from significant improvements in the quality of their broadband  by 2016, whereas under Labor's very, very, very slow roll-out it will be  decades before they get to where they say they want it to be.

HOST:

David Bradbury, has the management of the NBN, the delays in the roll-out etcetera, that Senator Cormann alluded to, has that hamstrung the  Government's message when it comes to the broadband network?

BRADBURY:

I don't think so at all. I heard Mathias front with his three-word slogan  where he says we will deliver it faster, well he couldn't possibly mean a  higher speed, because even Malcolm Turnbull has conceded they will be  vastly lower speeds, so the only thing he can be talking about is getting it  to you sooner, well we can roll out walkie-talkies to people tomorrow if  that's the concern. The real issue here is, whichever plan you are looking  at we are going to be spending tens of billions of dollars on what is going  to be a significant infrastructure project for the future - not for tomorrow  or the next day, but for the next 50 or 100 years. Now the Coalition want  to shackle us

CORMANN:

[Inaudible]

BRADBURY:

Well with the speeds we have available with fibre to the premises  compared to the shoddy speeds available on your plan, then there will be  much greater opportunities. I make this point: the fundamental flaw with  the Opposition policy is they want to shackle our NBN network to the  ageing and degrading copper network. Just about every single complaint I  get into my office about broadband, the problem occurs within about 100  to 500 metres of the person's house. That is actually the most critical  area, where the ageing, degrading copper network is letting the system  down at the moment, and their plan is to spend tens of billions of dollars  but it only gets you back to the situation where it only gets you the  problem of using the ageing, degrading copper network. It is last  century's technology, we need to take fibre all the way to the premises.

HOST:

I want to ask you one last issue and it's out of politics to a degree,  although it was very political around the Crime Commission report. This is  drugs in sport. There are dramatic accusations made by the former sports  scientist at Essendon relating to the coach there. There's going to be a  news conference a bit later this morning involving the chairman of the  football club. Senator Cormann, what do you make of these allegations  and how should they be managed from here do you think?

CORMANN:

Well look, I don't have all the facts in front of me and when I don't have  all the facts in front of me I don't feel competent to make an informed  comment. Obviously I don't - well I'm very confident that over the next  few hours and days and weeks ahead that all will be revealed that needs  to be revealed. These are concerning allegations. I don't think I can make  any specific comments.

HOST:

Okay David Bradbury, your thoughts on this? Following on from the Crime  Commission report, of course.

BRADBURY:

Look I think you've got a unity ticket from Mathias and me on this one.  The reality is that there are investigations ongoing and I don't think it  serves anyone's purposes for politicians to be commenting or providing a  running commentary on individual cases. Let the process run its course.  Obviously we're all concerned about the nature of some of these  allegations but let the processes run their course.

HOST:

Okay. David Bradbury, finally to you, the deal done this week. A few  problems at home politically but the China deal seen as a win for the  Prime Minister. There's every likelihood, however, that this dialogue will  occur under a Coalition Government, there is bipartisan support for it but  it's at least a win this week.

BRADBURY:

Well look I think people will look back on the foreign policy record of what  has occurred in the last three years alone as being a very significant  period in Australia's history. We saw the significant gains in further  enmeshing our relationship with China that have occurred over the last  couple of days, but under Prime Minister Gillard we've seen greater  engagement with India, we've seen a strengthening of our already strong  relationship with the US. I think that this is a very, very strong and  credible foreign policy record and Prime Minister Gillard should be  acknowledged for her personal efforts in having delivered some of these  outcomes.

HOST:

Senator Cormann, that was a significant step, the strategic partnership  with Beijing?

CORMANN:

It was a significant step. Obviously the relationship with China is a very  important one for Australia and as you've said in your introductory  remarks there is bipartisan commitment for that increase and stronger  engagement with China and we've welcomed that.

HOST:

Senator Mathias Cormann, appreciate your time. David Bradbury,  Assistant Treasurer, thank you for your time as well.
