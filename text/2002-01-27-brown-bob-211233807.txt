Woomera - Greens seek Senate inquiry

MEDIA RELEASE 28th January 2002

Woomera Senate Inquiry: Greens will seek ALP, Democrats backing

The Greens will seek an urgent inquiry into Woomera and other detention centres when the Senate resumes on 12th February, Senator Bob Brown said in Adelaide today.

Senator Brown told a press conference this morning that Woomera should be closed.

“Australia’s reputation is being damaged around the world by pictures resembling concentration camps. These people are warm-hearted human beings and deserve to be treated with respect.”

“The Government has locked itself in on the crisis and needs a ‘break-out’ strategy” said Senator Brown.

He urged Mr Howard to visit Woomera and demanded that media access be guaranteed.

He said a Senate inquiry can get the facts from both sides of the razor wire and come up with solutions such as the European handling of asylum seekers without long-term detention.
