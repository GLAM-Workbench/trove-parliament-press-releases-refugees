IT'S EASY FOR   YOU TO SAY

AND IT'S STILL   NOT FINISHED

The.purpose of this new monthly publication is to provide  information and data which may serve as a basis for newspaper  articles, speeches and discussions on the many issues related  to immigration and ethnic affairs.

It will incorporate decisions of meetings of Labor Ministers and  Shadow Ministers, views from my Federal Parliamentary Labor  Party colleagues, and of course, my own comments.

Should you wish to provide information, cite interesting examples,  of,  problems in the area of immigration or ethnic affairs, seek  further information, or express contrary points of view, your -

contribution will be welcome. .

I hope that "In Other Words" will become an open and valuable  forum to stimulate interest and discussion in this field.

An overseas tourist could easily assume that no language other  than English is spoken by our immigration officials (and how  right he is). On the incoming and the outgoing passenger cards  the words "The card must be completed in the English language"  are printed on the back of each card in English alone.

What would happen if Australians travelling to Japan, Israel  or Egypt would be required, in the local language, to fill in  forms? The Department believes that "...all answers to questions  on passenger cards are to be given in the English language. This  facilitates identification and passenger clearance at ports...

(the data) is available for evidentiary purposes before Courts".

Judging by the attitude of the Department of Immigration, it would  seem that in our courts evidence is admitted only in English. This is not true, as Courts often avail themselves of the services  of qualified interpreters....working for the Department of  Immigration.

The original contract for the construction of the High Court  was let in April 1975 for $18.5 million. The estimated cost of  the building at the end of February 1980 is $49.1 million. And  it’s still not finished!

There are 143 Australian citizens imprisoned or detained  overseas. Of these,  88 are detained on drug-related charges,  and 55 on other charges. Here are some examples:

Drug related charges other charges total

There are a number of teachers recruited from overseas to teach  in Australia. They came to Australia from the following countries:  New Zealand, United Kingdom, Canada and the United States. The  Double Taxation Agreements between Australia and each of these .   countries exempts those teachers who visit Australia for a period  not exceeding two years from Australian tax.

This is a bit hard to understand at a time when teachers Â·

graduating from our own colleges and universities cannot find  employment. Indeed, there is also the obvious question: why are there no such agreements with Italy, Greece, Yugoslavia, Turkey,  Spain and others, given that there is^ an urgent need in Australia  Ã¢ÂÂ   for the teaching of community languages?

Australia no longer has a "White Australia" "discriminatory"  immigration policy. We just advertise "selectively".

DID YOU

QANTAS

KNOW? Health:  The Department of Health's proposed generous administrative expense to cater for the specific needs*of the  ethnic communities of 0.64%. (Hansard (Reps) October 9 1979  p 1804). .

Jews: Jews are 'discouraged' from flying with Qantas on certain flights. How does the reservation clerk know that someone is  a Jew? Easyl By "....indications such as a name and request  for Kosher meals".  (Hansard (Senate) May 1 1979 pp 1510-1511).

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Permanent resident visa:  A permanent resident who is not a naturalised Australian citizen must apply for a re-entry visa  before departing on an overseas visit.

.  Citizenship: The average processing time of applications for Australian citizenship is approximately 15 weeks. (House of  Reps Question No 4909)..

Have you noticed: That ethnic communities and groups are rarely shown as participants in Australian history. Their efforts are  typically described as "contributions" to the dominant society.  Members of the ethnic communities are also depicted as  .  "beneficiaries" who should be grateful for receiving what is

in fact their rights. "Paternalistic" and unnecessarily  insulting, don't you think?

At October 9 1979 QANTAS employed 13,590 staff world-wide,  including 681 technical crew and 2021 cabin crew. The following  languages are spoken reasonably fluently by the staff.

Australia is perhaps the only country in the world which has no  bi-lingual signs, directories, warnings or announcements on  its national and international aircraft and at airports.

A person is qualified to receive an Australian age pension if  that person has resided in Australia for a continuous period  of not less than 10 years. He/she must reside and be physically  present in Australia on the date on which the claim for an  age pension is made. To be eligible a man must have reached ,   65 years of age or in the case of a woman, 60 years of age. Once an Australian age pension has been granted, it continues  to be payable irrespective of the pensioner's country of  residence (subject to a means test).

(Source:  Hansard (Reps) November 22 1979 p 3431).

(In general), in Italy an "age pension" is payable to a person  in respect of whom appropriate contributions have been made for  a period of not less than 15 years and who, in the case of a  man, has reached 60 years of age, or in the case of a woman,   has reached 55 years of age. The age qualification may be  waived for a person in respect of whom 35 years of contributions  have been made.  There is no nationality or residence test for  pensions (only the requirement that contributions to the pension

fund- have been paid for at least 15 years).
