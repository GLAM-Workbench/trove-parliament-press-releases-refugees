TONY ABBOTT:

It’s good to be here in Roleystone. I want to thank the Anile family, particularly Ross and Joe, for making  myself and Don Randall so welcome here today. This is a great local business. It’s been serving the  community for decades and it’s my intention, it’s Don Randall's intention, to try to make it easier for  businesses like this to continue serving the community.

Now, as every Australian knows, the cost of living pressures that are on the average family are just getting  worse and worse and worse. In the last quarter we saw power bills go up by 14 per cent, we saw gas bills go  up by 14 per cent. These are the biggest quarterly increases on record and this is just making it tougher and  tougher for families to make ends meet. As far as I'm concerned, my mission is to try to take the cost of  living pressures off the forgotten families of Australia and that means doing more for child care, making it  easier for mothers through a proper paid parental leave scheme and, of course, it means removing the carbon  tax because the carbon tax is making it much harder for people like the Anile family to serve their customers  and to give their customers the good prices that they need.

Here in this business, the carbon tax has increased the monthly power bill by well over $1,100. It means that  they have got to spend up to $100,000 renovating all of their fridges and freezers and it is just going to get  worse and worse and worse as time goes by. A business like this is going to face a triple whammy because  of the carbon tax. The power price goes up, the refrigeration price goes up and the transport price goes up  and what that means is that every family pays more for their groceries.

Just before I pass to Don and then to Ross to say a few words, I should just note that in the last 24 hours  Australia has received its 30,000th illegal arrival by boat under the current government. The current  government has completely lost control of our borders and they haven't got a clue what to do. They just are  clueless when it comes to dealing with the crisis on our borders. The flow of boats has become a flood and  this government's heart is just not in the policies needed to fix the problem. What we need to do is go back  to the policies that worked. That means temporary protection visas to deny the people smugglers a product

to sell, rigorous offshore processing, not half-hearted offshore processing at Nauru and elsewhere, and above  all else a willingness to turn boats around where it is safe to do so.

I’m going to ask Don Randall to say a few words as the local member and then I’ll ask Ross to explain the  impact of the carbon tax on a store like this.

DON RANDALL:

Thanks very much Tony. Very briefly, welcome to Roleystone and I want to thank our good friend Ross the  proprietor and his family all here today for bringing Tony into this Supa IGA to see the direct effect that the  government's policy is having on their ability to do business in the Roleystone area. It seriously puts cost  pressure on the prices in a business like this and that’s why Ross wanted Tony to come and see first-hand the  sort of things that they face as a medium-sized business where they are not going to get any help from the  Gillard Labor government on any of these issues.

So, I think it’s fantastic that Tony's come up into Roleystone and not only meeting the family and seeing  how business is done here but a number of the staff and realise that this is real Australia and this is where  people want their voices heard. So, thanks very much for that, Tony, and I will pass over the Ross.

ROSS ANILE:

I'd like to thank Tony Abbott for being here in our store and seeing our situation and realising that this tax is  deceptive, it is regressive, it is an ongoing cost to my business and to all businesses in Australia, not just my  business but fuel costs, transport is a huge issue for retail because we are outsourcing a lot of our product  from the eastern states and I can't see the benefit to the Australian community. It is hurting us, it has cost me  already $35,000 just between gas changes and lighting as we can see in the store. I am up for another  $100,000 just in glass door refrigeration to reduce our carbon footprint. And at the end of the day we have  no way of recouping that cost. I will not pass it onto my customers. My customers mean a lot to me and I  don't think it is fair that they should bear the cost of this deceptive regressive tax.

Thank you.

TONY ABBOTT:

Thanks Ross. Ok, are there any questions?

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, solar panel installation is a fairly big part of the Coalition's direct action plan for tackling climate  change. Given the Productivity Commission’s now recommended the Government drop all subsidies for  solar installation, will you be taking steps to remove that from the programme?

TONY ABBOTT:

We will carefully consider recommendations of the Productivity Commission. We take the Productivity  Commission seriously. That is why I’ve called for a Productivity Commission inquiry into child care  because we need more affordable, more accessible child care. But, as I said, we will take those  recommendations seriously but we do want to see a strong renewables sector.

QUESTION:

Do you think the government subsidies for solar panel installations are an efficient allocation of government  funds?

TONY ABBOTT:

There is no doubt that the renewable energy target is having an impact on prices, no doubt about that, and I  think we have to be concerned about everything that is having an impact on power prices, but if this  government was serious about bringing power prices down, the one thing it could do is get rid of the carbon  tax. If it got rid of the carbon tax at a stroke there's ten per cent of the power price gone.

QUESTION:

Just a couple of questions on the GST. Rob Oakeshott said both major parties will tweak the GST after the  election. Is the Coalition considering changing the GST?

TONY ABBOTT:

The only party leader that Rob Oakeshott talks to these days is the leader of the Labor Party. So he may well  know that the Labor Party has a secret plan to increase the GST, to change the GST after the election. We  have no plans, none, and I invite Rob Oakeshott to campaign in his seat for changes to the GST if he thinks  they are necessary.

QUESTION:

Can you really afford not to make changes for four years?

TONY ABBOTT:

We are about reducing taxes, not increasing taxes. We are about getting rid of taxes, not imposing new  taxes.

QUESTION:

Is that a promise?

TONY ABBOTT:

This is my whole reason for being in politics, in the Parliament. I want to take the burdens off people  because I want to see an Australia where citizens count for more and officials count for less; where we have  smaller and more effective government and larger and more effective citizens and community organisations.

QUESTION:

Does that mean you are not prepared to commit to a per capita distribution of GST despite calls from the  Coalition state premiers?

TONY ABBOTT:

I take my Coalition state colleagues very, very seriously, as you would expect, but we do have a review  process under way, the Greiner-Brumby review process. Let's wait and see what their recommendations are  and when they come out the Coalition will respond fully to them.

QUESTION:

Premier Barnett says he is worried about the terms of reference for the Royal Commission into child abuse  potentially being too wide and damaging public institutions as a result. Are they concerns you share?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think these are perfectly legitimate concerns from the Premier. The Prime Minister, as I understand it, is  now consulting over the terms of reference, over the cost and personnel for the Royal Commission. Let's  wait and see what she comes up with.

QUESTION:

On a state-based issue, a Chinese company is tipped to have won the right to develop 15,000 hectares of  land under the second stage expansion of the Ord irrigation scheme in the Kimberley. What are your  thoughts on that?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, we support foreign investment provided it’s clearly in Australia’s national interest and one of the  points that has been made in favour of this particular foreign investment is that it’s not selling the farm, it’s  actually building the farm.

QUESTION:

Also, the state opposition is calling on you to reveal whether or not you support the Gateway project in WA  and how a future Liberal government intends to fund it.

TONY ABBOTT:

We’ve already said that we support the Gateway project. It’s very important. We support modern  infrastructure. We are committed to major new projects in each of the states and that’s one that we certainly  support.

QUESTION:

Just on the child abuse inquiry, Mr Abbott, Colin Barnett said he won’t hold a joint inquiry with the Federal  Government. Do you think that’s appropriate?

TONY ABBOTT:

It is, in the end, a national Royal Commission. It’s the Prime Minister’s initiative. It’s an initiative that we  called for and support but given that it is a national Royal Commission it is, in the end, the Prime Minister’s  responsibility.

QUESTION:

So will you be calling on the state premiers to fully cooperate with the, I suppose, the terms of the inquiry?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think all of the state premiers have indicated that they support the inquiry. I think the Prime Minister has  attempted to, I suppose, get them to fund it. Well, when things are a national responsibility it is appropriate  that the national government pick up the tab.

QUESTION:

Would you expect state government departments or other agencies to cooperate at a state level, to be  involved in gathering information?

5





TONY ABBOTT:

I have no reason to think that they won’t do exactly that.

QUESTION:

Did you watch Q&A last night?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, I didn’t see it because I was on a plane, but I believe that Malcolm gave an outstanding performance  and the great thing about the Coalition is that we are a united team. Malcolm Turnbull is in the Coalition’s  team, in a way that Kevin Rudd is not in Labor’s team. Malcolm will be a senior minister in the next  Coalition government. Kevin Rudd is in the outer as long as Julia Gillard is the Prime Minister.

Thank you.
