The Hon. Danna Vale MP  Minister for Veterans' Affairs   Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence   Speech  Saturday 1 March 2003







Annual State Conference of the NSW Branch of the Naval Association of Australia

Ballina RSL Club

Distinguished guests and delegates, it is a real pleasure for me to be here today. I  would like to take this opportunity to update you on some of the developments within  my particular portfolio that have happened in the last 12 months and also with you to  look towards the future to see how I can better serve you as your Minister.

As you know, we’ve had a Review of Veterans’ Entitlements over the last 12 months.  I instigated the committee immediately following my appointment as Minister. It was  chaired by the Hon John Clarke QC and we had a representative of our Defence  personnel in Air Marshal Doug Riding, and a retired public servant of some  distinction, Dr David Rosalky.

During 2002, this Committee took over 3000 submissions from the veteran  community, and it is probably one of the most profound reviews ever undertaken by  Government. Of course your Naval Association did make a significant submission  and I thank you for your contribution. The Review process has provided the veteran  community with a genuine opportunity to voice their concerns.

The Report of the Review has now been released and many of you, I’m sure, would  have a copy. The Review Committee has made a total of 109 recommendations to  Government. Some are positive recommendations and some were in the negative.  They cover areas such as qualifying service under the Veterans’ Entitlements Act  1986, eligibility for the Gold Card, benefits for T&PI and other disability pension  recipients, and rehabilitation arrangements.

The Department received a few salvos on the fact that they did not focus on  rehabilitation and as you know, Veterans’ Affairs have always looked at  compensation and health care. It does seem to me from observation that rehabilitation  is one of those modern principles that is part of any compensation package. And when  I say rehabilitation I do not mean necessarily vocational rehabilitation, but that  rehabilitation can encompass lifestyle. We got some very profound recommendations  from the Vietnam veteran community and they are certainly making Government  think.

We have not yet responded as this is such a complex review and we will be having a  deep look at this. We also want your feedback. The Committee’s recommendations  address a range of issues that will require the Government to give it some very precise  and careful consideration. Some of these are complex matters and I will be listening to  the veteran community.

One of the recommendations received an immediate response from the Prime  Minister. The recommendation of the Review that the Gold Card be means-tested has  been immediately vetoed by the Prime Minister. That’s not going to happen.

Any response will be designed to further build upon the system of repatriation that we  have in Australia. In line with the Government’s approach it will deliver significant  advances to the veteran community, including some of the initiatives that we have had  in the last 12 months. We have made several significant commitments to Australian  veterans and war widows, for example;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The extension of the Gold Card to all former Australian Defence Force  personnel aged 70 years and over with qualifying service. This was  implemented on 1 July last year.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Last September 81,000 war widows benefited from the removal of the freeze  on the ceiling of the War Widow’s Income Support Supplement. This was  associated with the introduction of twice yearly indexation of the Income  Support Supplement.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ 2002 also saw the successful introduction of two measures which were  announced in the 2001-02 Budget. The war widow’s pension was restored to  some 3000 war widows, who had remarried before 1984 and had therefore had  their pensions cancelled.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ And the Government extended the Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefits Card  to British, Commonwealth and Allied veterans with qualifying service over the  age of 70.

A key priority for the Veterans’ Affairs portfolio, however, remains the provision of a  high standard of health and aged care to the ageing veteran population.

As the veteran population ages, their health care needs are changing significantly. By  2007, two-thirds of all veterans and war widows with Gold Card entitlements will be  over the age of 80.

Just turning to something said earlier, the ageing of our population generally, not just  in the Naval Association, is proving to be a real challenge to governments. Not just  the Federal Government, but also state governments, and all governments in the  Western world. We are not having the birth rate we need.

As the Minister for Health and Ageing said yesterday, in Australia today we have  2000 people who are over the age of 100. In 40 years time, we will have 38,000  people in Australia who are over the age of 100. This is going to provide incredible  challenges for Government.

The benefits of great health care, the advances in medical science, have all contributed  to this. Never before in our history has there been such a huge aged cohort in our  community.

What you are seeing in the numbers in your Naval Association is reflected across the  wider community.  As you are aware, there has been some concern in recent months about the level of  payments to specialists and GPs for treatment under the Gold Card.

This remains a high priority for the Government and options for a satisfactory  resolution are still being worked on and are under consideration.

There is a huge problem with doctors and medical indemnity right across the whole of  government. This is not just a veterans’ issue. So the Government is looking at it and  solve it as a whole health issue.

We are still in bona fide discussions with the AMA.

My Department continues to work with other government agencies and the health care  sector, providing funding and advice to ensure that veterans continue to receive the  very best of care.

Meanwhile increased funding has been directed to programs that provide a wide range  of home services to those veterans who want to continue to live at home and who can  continue to live independently at home.

Internationally respected work continues within DVA with several health studies  being conducted in recent times, some of which are completed and others ongoing.  These include:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ the Vietnam Water Contamination Study

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ the Korean War Veterans Mortality Study and Cancer incidence study

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ a third Vietnam Veterans Mortality study

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ the Gulf War veterans health study, which we hope to release very soon; and

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ the Nuclear Test Participants Cancer Incidence and Mortality Study.

One study, which would have been of great interest to you is the Vietnam Water  Contamination Study. This study investigated the possible exposure of Royal  Australian Navy personnel to dioxins during the Vietnam War.

This study was undertaken in response to concerns from Navy veterans of results from  the Vietnam Veterans Mortality Study in 1997, which showed a high mortality rate  among Royal Australian Navy personnel, particularly Logistic Support personnel.

However, the findings of the study will also potentially affect those who travelled as  passengers from Vietnam on board HMAS Sydney, and the crews of Army small  ships that served in Vietnam.

The study researched the possibility that exposure to herbicide could occur through  the evaporative water distillation processes used on ships while in Vietnamese waters.

The National Resource Centre’s tests showed that dioxins can pass through this  process. The study concluded that if contaminated water was used in this process, it is  likely that the consumption of drinking water exposed personnel to dioxin levels that  exceeded safe levels recently proposed by the National Health and Medical Research  Council in a draft recommendation.

This is a matter of great concern to the Government in fulfilling our commitment to  care for those who served during the Vietnam War.

All Australians who served in the armed forces in Vietnam are already entitled to  treatment and compensation for war-caused conditions related to exposure to dioxin.

Nevertheless, these results may have implications for the Statements of Principles that  govern determination of links between wartime service and these conditions.

I have asked that the study findings be referred to the independent Repatriation  Medical Authority, to consider whether any changes are necessary to these Statements  of Principles. The study findings have also been referred to the Chief of Navy.

The results will also be taken into account in the Vietnam Veteran Mortality and  Cancer Incidence Study, now being undertaken by the Department of Veterans’  Affairs.

The Government is also establishing a register of female Vietnam veterans to enable  future female health studies, as previous studies have had difficulties finding female  veterans who have married or changed their names since their service.

This research continues to enable the Government and DVA to progress policy on a  sound scientific basis that identifies and engages the health needs of our veterans.

I anticipate that draft legislation for a new Military Compensation Scheme will be  released later this year. This legislation will bring together veteran and military  compensation to create a single scheme to meet the compensation and rehabilitation  needs of serving and former Defence Force members.

A problem is that often like injury is not always treated with like compensation and I  think that we all want to make sure that no matter where or how our personnel are  injured, they should get the same compensation. We had a problem with the Black  Hawk disaster when we found that some of the families because depending on  whether their member had qualifying service or not, actually got a different level of  compensation. That’s not to say that we are looking to get rid of qualifying service  when it comes to Gold Card or other initiatives such as the lower pension age or lesser  onus of proof. But we feel that providing like compensation for like injuries is a very  important principle.

As many of you know, in 2002 I launched the Saluting Their Service  commemorations program to bring a new focus on our commitment to honour the  service and sacrifice of our servicemen and women in wars, conflicts and peace  operations.

Remembering and honouring your contribution is an important part of national life  and I do take this part of my portfolio responsibilities very seriously. I have been  pleased to see the growth of interest, particularly amongst younger Australians, in  commemorative activities. This is where I think we can focus on our young people,  and allow them to understand that Australia is a land of great opportunity. We are a  land of great opportunity because we are a land of prosperity. We are a land of  prosperity because we are a land of peace. And that’s where we owe you, our  veterans, because you have made the peace in this country. For our veterans were  prepared to stand up, put on the uniform of the Commonwealth, and even march from  our shores and fight for our great Australian way of life. That’s why we are a land of

immense opportunity today and we owe it all to each and every one of you, and the

women who loved you. It is very important to me to make sure that the young  children in school today know who they owe.

In 2002 we had several commemorative missions - to Singapore, El Alamein and  Papua New Guinea to commemorate the 60th anniversaries of key World War II  events and to attend the dedication of new national memorials at Isurava on the  Kokoda Track, Milne Bay and Popondetta.

These missions were given wide coverage in the domestic media and helped bring out  the importance of these events in our national history, and highlighted the fortitude  and courage of our servicemen and women who served in these important campaigns.  They also made sure that the young people in schools were very much aware of what

happened.

It was a privilege to support the re-dedication of the Australian Vietnam Forces  National Memorial in Canberra in October 2002. This was a highly successful event,  which marked the tenth anniversary of the Memorial’s dedication. More than 5,000  Vietnam veterans and family were able to catch up with old mates and remember  those who no longer stood among them.

In 2003, I am looking forward to the unveiling of the London Memorial in Hyde Park  on Remembrance Day, commemorating those Australians who fought alongside  British forces in the defence of freedom during two world wars. The Westminister  Council has given us a strategic spot in the corner of Hyde Park in the heart of  London for our Australian memorial. The memorial is shaped like a gum leaf and it  will have the names of some of our country towns from whence young Aussies signed  up, and superimposed on those names will be the names of the names of the iconic  battles of the two world wars.

Another very significant achievement has been the establishment of the World War II  Nominal Roll Website, which was launched on 6 November 2002. There has been an  overwhelming response to this initiative with more than 19 million visits to the  website to date. This has resulted in many more people getting interested in their  relative’s history and putting in an application to get their real records. The War  Memorial is going to have to look at ways to deal with the absolutely overwhelming  response to people looking for their dad’s or their grandad’s or their great  grandfather’s records.

So the Veterans’ Affairs portfolio continues to be a busy and important one within  national life. I’d also like to take this opportunity to give you an update on current  developments for our Navy - in which I know you all have an abiding interest.

Today we find the Navy operating in a range of roles that is probably broader than  that at any time in our history. Moreover, the number of operations that the Navy is  presently conducting means that the operational tempo is now higher than it has been  for several decades.

In 2002, the rate of effort for the surface combatant, amphibious and hydrographic  forces nearly doubled that of previous years.

Much of the public focus for the Navy in 2002 included the Middle East area of  operations, where nine ships have deployed in the past 18 months. Also, RAN officers  assumed the function of composite warfare commander for maritime interception

operations involving the RAN, the Royal Navy and US Navy ships. This significant  factor is a huge feather in the caps of the Australian Navy. The Anzac and Darwin  both had the highest strike rate for boardings of all ships over there. Our Australian  servicemen and women, wherever they are deployed, always punch a lot higher than  our weight. Our Navy in the Gulf has such respect from the American command that  they have allocated a joint rotating command for our Australian Naval captains.

This rate of effort is likely to continue unabated for the foreseeable future. You would  also be aware that an additional naval unit and a clearance diving team have been  forward deployed in the event of hostilities against Iraq.

Closer to home, major fleet units, patrol boats and hydrographic ships have been  extremely effective in thwarting the efforts of people smugglers and unauthorised boat  arrivals from the north. Indeed, no unauthorised boat arrivals reached mainland  Australia in 2002.

Other operations have included the provision of support to the peace monitoring  group in Bougainville, protection of our economic exclusion zone off Heard and  Macquarie Island and coastwatch civil surveillance.

2002 also saw a number of new vessels added to our order of battle: the  commissioning of another ANZAC class frigate (HMAS Stuart) and the minehunter  (HMAS Diamantina) and today we can add the HMAS Yarra.

Given that the operational tempo experienced in 2002 is likely to remain at the same  levels throughout this year, the Navy’s primary focus for 2003 will be striking a  sustainable balance between support for current operations and future capability  requirements.

To achieve this, the Navy will continue to pay careful attention to people, safety,  support for the fleet, support of rationalisation and development of naval  infrastructure requirements, as well as current and future capability.

Many of you will have seen or heard the recent media coverage concerning the  inoculations against anthrax for deployed Navy personnel. Some of you may have  concerns about this vaccination program and its possible effects on Navy people.

If a member of the RAN does not wish to take the vaccinations that is their right and  we will respect individuals’ wishes in this regard. Today, inoculations are seen as  personally invasive, and, if after the given information and education, a person does  not want to receive it, we will not force them to do so. However, we cannot leave  them in that area where they could be in a position to contract that disease.

It is equally important to ensure that our serving men and women are protected, as  much as we can, from any threat and we shall not deploy sailors into harms way  without adequate personal protection.

The anthrax vaccine is safe and has been very widely used with no greater incidence  of side effects or risk of complications than is associated with any other vaccine. The  best form of protection against infection by anthrax is to be vaccinated, therefore  Defence will provide its personnel with this protection. But we will not leave  personnel in the area if they exercise that choice. I understand the UK has a different

policy. They offer the vaccination to their personnel and if they refuse to take it they  ask their personnel to sign an indemnity form but they still deploy that member.

The US has a different policy. They must be inoculated and if they don’t they face  disciplinary action. I am told other countries do not vaccinate at all. In Australia we  believe it is a personal issue and if our sailors, soldiers and airmen choose not to be  vaccinated we will not deploy them in an area where we think they may contract  anthrax.

The Navy's strength lies in its people. And it is people, like yourselves, former  officers and sailors who have served at sea, who have made the Navy what it is today.

Today, as in the past, Australian sailors wear their uniform with justifiable pride, and  consistently demonstrate their commitment and professionalism to an admiring world.

I count it a great privilege to have been given responsibility to serve our veterans and  current defence personnel.

My time as Minister for Veterans’ Affairs and Minister Assisting the Minister for  Defence has been extremely rewarding to date. I look forward to continuing to work  with you and other ex-service organisations to ensure that your needs are heard and  met by Government.

I am very much aware that you were not just Navy, you were Australian sailors.  You’re the pride of the nation, amongst the best in the world.

And it is a real humbling privilege for me to be able to serve you and try to pay  something back.

I wish you well as you meet at this 55th Annual State Conference.

Thank you.
