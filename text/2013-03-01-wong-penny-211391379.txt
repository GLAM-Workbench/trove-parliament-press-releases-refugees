TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW - SKY AM AGENDA WITH KIERAN GILBERT

SUBJECT: ASYLUM SEEKERS; SENATOR SINODINOS; WORKCHOICES; GLOBAL  ECONOMY

E  & O E - PROOF ONLY



GILBERT: Minister, thanks for your time.

WONG: Good to be with you.

GILBERT: A group of asylum seekers were evicted from derelict houses in Parramatta  yesterday in Sydney. Is the Government’s policy of bridging visas creating an underclass  here?

WONG: Let’s remember we do provide more support in the initial period, particularly for  bridging visa holders, than the Howard Government did on Temporary Protection Visas. But  I would make a comment about the debate that’s occurred recently in relation to asylum  seekers: I’ve always thought there are two very distinct issues when it comes to border  protection and asylum seeker policy. What is the very difficult public policy issues - and  we’ve been grappling with those, and they are been difficult - but the second is whether or  not politicians choose to demonise a particular group, and I think it’s been regrettable that  yet again we see members of the Coalition doing that over these last few days.

GILBERT: But you say that there’s more support initially compared to the Howard  Government’s TPVs - Temporary Protection Visas - but the problem with the bridging visa,  is it not, is that they can’t work? These people will be essentially an underclass. We saw  these derelict houses in Sydney ... they’re living in squalor.

WONG: I again make the point that there are some very difficult public policy issues and  the previous Minister has spoken about the importance of not providing an advantage to  people who do come to Australia by means other than the legitimate processes and that  creates some challenges. But I do make the point that we do provide more support and  initial accommodation for bridging visa holders than was ever provided by the Howard  Government.

GILBERT: The Government accused the Coalition of ‘dog whistle politics’ yesterday - of  sending coded political messages on this issue. It’s hard for the Government to take the  moral high ground though, isn’t it  -

WONG: I don’t agree ...

GILBERT:  - when these social cohesion issues come up?

WONG: I don’t agree and I’d refer back to my first answer. I remember I came into  Parliament during what was known as the ‘Tampa Election’ and I always thought that the  problem with the debate and the way the Coalition Government at that point handled the  debate is that they did seek to just demonise asylum seekers, and we all remember  ‘children overboard’. We all remember the suggestion that there would be terrorists coming  into our country. Now, I think it is incumbent upon leaders to not fuse two very different  issues - one is, as I say, very complex public policy issues to which there is no easy  answer and anyone who pretends there is is wrong, and the issue of how you deal with a  particular group of people who are seeking asylum. I don’t think we should be demonising  people or vilifying them and unfortunately once you insert that into the public rhetoric it can  be very difficult.

GILBERT: Just finally on this, it does create a big social cohesion problem, doesn’t it, if  you’ve got an underclass basically living in squalor with no ability to work. It seems to me  that this is not sustainable.

WONG: I think the issue is we need to try and continue with policies that prevent people  making the journey for a whole range of reasons, not least of which is the risk to life that we  have seen. No one can forget the tragedies we’ve seen in this area in past years.

GILBERT: That is true. Let’s move on to some other issues. Senator Sinodinos - Arthur  Sinodinos - former John Howard Chief of Staff and senior figure in the Liberal Party. Last  night he declared six previously undeclared directorships to the Senate. It’s not the first time  an MP hasn’t kept their Parliamentary Register up to date ...

WONG: It doesn’t really sort of pass the ‘person on the street test’ though, to say ‘I forgot I  was a director of six organisations’. I can understand that there are occasions people might  make an error, forget something, but that’s a fairly large error, to forget that you’re a director  of six organisations. And Senator Sinodinos is not a ‘newbie’, in the sense that he’s been  around the traps a fair while - he was a staffer to Prime Minister Howard and in fact you  might recall that Senator Santoro was a Senator who had to resign because he failed to  keep his Register up to date and Senator Sinodinos was certainly around when that  occurred. In fact, Senator Santoro as I understand it was a director of one of those  companies.

GILBERT: But he’s not the first one to not keep the Register up to date. These oversights  can be innocent and this is what Senator Sinodinos says this is - an innocent oversight.

WONG: And what I’d say to you is I heard what Senator Sinodinos said. But if you’ve got  six organisations that you forget to declare a relationship with, that does seem a little odd.  As I said, let’s remember Arthur’s not somebody’s who’s new to the traps.

GILBERT: A few other issues: the Coalition’s IR plan. According to The Australian, we’ll  see them put this to the Productivity Commission in the next term if they win and take any  changes that they might have to the next election. It‘s hard to complain about that - it’s  giving the people a chance to decide.

WONG: I don’t think anybody who listens to Eric Abetz or other members of the Coalition  would believe anything other than that they are desperately keen to return to WorkChoices.  I mean, this is -

GILBERT: But it wouldn’t be until the after next election -

WONG: My view and I think most people looking at and listening to Coalition members and  what members of their party room say when they are perhaps being a little more open and  honest perhaps about what they believe, there is a deep ideological commitment to labour  market changes which are all about reducing wages and conditions. It’s a deep ideological  commitment inside the Liberal Party. Tony Abbott likes to talk a lot about DNA and “what’s  in their DNA” and what’s “in the marrow of their bones” and all sorts of things, well, let me  tell you WorkChoices is absolutely in the Liberal DNA.

GILBERT: I want to ask you one last question on the debt issue in the United States - this  ‘debt sequester’ as it’s called. The potential for $85 billion in automatic budget cuts to kick  into effect over the next couple of days. How worried are you about that?

WONG: Obviously, the whole world does watch when the US Congress  debates these  issues and I certainly woke up to a lot of activity on Twitter where it’s clear that this is a  pretty controversial issue still in the United States. Obviously, what we hope is that the  United States finds a way through it that isn’t going to be damaging to their economy, that’s  going to ensure that the US economy continues its recovery. They’re in a much more  challenging position than Australia. Obviously what happens in the US affects the whole  world.

GILBERT: Minister, thanks for your time.

WONG: Good to be with you.
