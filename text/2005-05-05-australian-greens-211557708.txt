DIMIA spent $13,159 to prevent proper  psychiatric care for Baxter detainee

5th May 2005

Following today's Federal Court decision that the Department of Immigration  has breached its duty of care by failing to provide adequate psychiatric  treatment for two Baxter detainees, Senator Kerry Nettle revealed another  case where DIMIA spent $13,159 to prevent him from receiving proper  psychiatric treatment.  "The government is not only neglecting immigration detainees' mental health,  but actively working to prevent proper psychiatric care," said Senator Nettle  "Today's Federal Court decision is yet more proof that mandatory detention is  failing utterly to provide basic human rights and medical care for detainees.  "In answer to a Senate Estimates Question on Notice, DIMIA revealed that it  spent $13,159 in legal costs in its attempt to prevent a detainee, Mr H, from  being transferred from Baxter Detention Centre to Glenside Psychiatric  Hospital in Adelaide.  "Despite obvious signs that this man was suffering a serious mental illness  and repeated requests for a transfer, the Department had to be taken to  court eight times before Mr H was finally transferred.  "DIMIA are not only neglecting detainees' mental health, they are actively  working to prevent appropriate psychiatric care. The Minister owes the public  an explanation as to why her department spent $13,159 of taxpayers' money  to deny Mr H proper psychiatric care.  "Mr H remains in Glenside hospital and suffers a serious psychiatric illness  which medical experts say was caused by the conditions in immigration  detention."   "The government's policy of mandatory detention has created a black hole of  cruelty and abuse that is wasting the courts time and taxpayers' money. The  Greens policy is for an end to mandatory detention."
