LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION  THE HON. TONY ABBOTT MHR  FEDERAL MEMBER FOR WARRINGAH



VISIT TO NAURU



The Leader of the Opposition Tony Abbott and Shadow Immigration Minister Scott Morrison will fly to  Nauru this evening for a one day visit to the island nation.

Mr Abbott and Mr Morrison will meet with Nauruan President Marcus Stephen, along with senior  members of the Nauruan Parliament. Talks will centre on the nation's willingness to reopen the facilities  developed with the Howard Government, to facilitate the processing of asylum seekers who attempt to  reach Australia by boat.

"I look forward to inspecting the facilities at Nauru to reassure myself that the island can be an appropriate  place to house asylum seekers," said Mr Abbott.

"It's clear the centre at Nauru, if reopened, is a much better option than Julia Gillard's planned 5 for 1  people swap with Malaysia. Asylum seekers on Nauru would be supervised by Australian officials, they  would have appropriate health and education facilities and no asylum seeker on Nauru has the threat of  being caned."

"Labor's 5 for 1 people swap will cost Australian taxpayers at least $300 million. Reopening facilities in  Nauru could be achieved for a fraction of this amount as the centre could be reopened within weeks of a  deal being reached."

"Serious countries don't announce deals before they are finalised," Mr Abbott said.

This visit is just the latest in the Coalition's ongoing discussions with Nauru over its potentially crucial role  in dismantling the people smugglersâ€™ trade.

Nationals leader Warren Truss will be the acting Opposition Leader in Mr Abbott's absence.
