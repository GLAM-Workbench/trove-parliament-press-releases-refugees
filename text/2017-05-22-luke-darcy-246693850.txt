E&EO…………………………………………………………………………………………..

LUKE DARCY:

Peter Dutton has been good enough to join us, the Immigration Minister, thanks for  your time this morning Peter.

PETER DUTTON:

Pleasure Luke, thank you.

LUKE DARCY:

Can you explain what’s going on? People that are scheduled to be deported are  allowed to stay; why is that happening?

PETER DUTTON:

Well as you know Luke, and we’ve discussed this on the show before, we’ve really  been ramping up the scrutiny that we’ve been applying to criminals who are non-citizens - that is people who are visiting our country here on visas and they’re  committing crimes against citizens - we’ve been cancelling those visas and the AAT  - as it is pointed out in the paper today - has made decisions in relation to a number  of cases, a pretty significant number of cases, where they’ve decided to reject that  cancellation of the visa and we now need to appeal that, or in some circumstances I  can substitute that decision with a decision to still cancel the visa.

It is a long legal process, it costs a lot of money and it’s pretty frustrating - I suspect  particularly for the victims of those crimes - and if we allow people to stay in our  country that we know have committed serious crimes in the past, then there is a very  high likelihood of people committing those same crimes or similar crimes into the  future.

EDDIE MCGUIRE:

Peter, it’s put that these people would be in grave danger if they went back to their  country after getting here, but it has also been underlined that a number of these  people who claim that they will be killed if they were sent back to Iran, in six  instances, had also returned to Iran for holidays after getting their Protection visas  and knowing the fake refugees had lied to get asylum.

At what stage does your Department say, hey listen; we’ll run the show here, we  know what we’re doing, we’re not mean spirited, we’re going to do the right thing by  genuine asylum seekers, but these other ones they’re gone and we don’t need to tie  up the legal system protecting them?

PETER DUTTON:

Well this is the thing Eddie, I mean we are a generous country, we allow thousands  of refugees in each year and we provide them with a lot of support; housing,  education, health, welfare, etc, but we don’t want to extend a helping hand to those  people that aren’t legitimate refugees.

There are 65 million people in the world at the moment who are economic migrants  who would come to Australia tomorrow and we have to make sure that we’re  preserving support for those that are most in need.

So we don’t send people back to face persecution or where they may face some  threat, but as you point out, if you come here as a refugee and you’re claiming  protection and that you are going to be persecuted from the country from which  you’ve fled, but then you’re going back there on holidays or to get married or visit  rellies or whatever it might be, I think the Australian public starts to say hang on; this  is a bit of a con going on here.

As you point out there was a story last week in The Herald Sun where I’d taken a  decision to cancel six visas of people from Iran and the AAT had overturned those  decisions - and we’ll have a look at those individual cases again - but as I say the  frustration is that it does cost tens of millions of dollars each year. I’m having a look  at ways in which we might change the law now because clearly the system is not  working and we make these decisions on all of the information on the individual  cases - we don’t cancel visas lightly - and we do it within the law, but where they’re  overturned on technicalities or because people believe at the AAT  that these people  shouldn’t be sent back to their country of origin, then I think we’ve got a problem in  the system.

LUKE DARCY:

I think violent criminals, the opportunity to deport them, is something that we all  agree on. Is that the answer Peter to try and change legislation? Is that possibility  that you’ll be able to get some more powers to do this?

PETER DUTTON:

That maybe the answer Luke; obviously it’s difficult in the current Parliament  because we’ve got to get laws through the Senate, we need to get Mr Shorten’s  support to change the legislation and tighten it up, but again I think people should  have their fair day in court. I think they should have their matter scrutinised and as  the Minister, as the decision maker, I should abide by that decision - as the other  party to the matter should - but once the decision is made we should abide by the  umpires call and then I think move on because at the moment we’ve got this quasi-  judicial arrangement with the AAT, but matter then ultimately go onto the Federal  Court - the full Federal Court, the High Court - and some people can be here for  years and years and years and it costs literally millions of dollars of tax payers  money to run this matter through the court.

There are lots of pro bono lawyers around that support refugees or migrants,  economic migrants and it is a very expensive business for the Commonwealth.  Again, I just think we’re better off to concentrate our efforts on those people where  they have made out a claim and you know the other issue that we’re dealing with at  the moment, is that we’ve got people that have been here for five or six years - there  are about 7,500 at the moment - they’ve been here for five to six years, came on a  boat, they haven’t lodged their claims or they are refusing to answer questions about  their claim or refusing to answer questions about their identity, we just can’t allow  those people into our country.

EDDIE MCGUIRE:

Thanks Peter for your time this morning. We appreciate you coming on Triple M’s  The Hot Breakfast.

PETER DUTTON:

Thanks very much guys.
