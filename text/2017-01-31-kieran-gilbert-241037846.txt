E&EO…………………………………………………………………………………………..

KIERAN GILBERT:

First of all we’ve seen a lot of reaction to the Trump Executive Order. What do you  make of it given you’re our Immigration Minister?

PETER DUTTON:

Well from Australia’s perspective, if there are Australians that need assistance we’ll  provide that consular assistance to them. We’ve obviously got a very, very good  relationship with the US and if there are individual cases then we can help clear  those matters up. But as the Foreign Minister’s pointed out, she’s instructed our  Ambassador in Washington and our officials there to work with the US to achieve the  same exemption that Canada and the UK has and that’s the intent. So I think we  need to…

KIERAN GILBERT:

…we should get it. Boris Johnson told the House of Commons that the UK had that  exemption because it’s part of the Five Eyes arrangement and so are we.

PETER DUTTON:

Yeah look and as I say, I mean this is the reason we’ve got a good relationship with  the US. It’s multifaceted obviously in terms of the exchange of the intelligence  through the Five Eyes process, but also on Customs and border crossings, there is a  lot of work obviously that we’re doing in that space as well. So it’s a very deep and  abiding relationship. We will work with the US and there are many movements of  people in and out of Australia and the US each day, so the Foreign Minister is  working as hard as she can…

KIERAN GILBERT:

…what about the merits of this temporary ban? What do you make of them?

PETER DUTTON:

Well I think it’s an issue for the US Kieran. I think it’s the case that when Australia  implemented a tough border protection policy here we were criticised by many  countries, but in the end what we did was what was in our best national interest.

We’ve stopped boats, we’ve stopped drownings at sea, we’ve got kids out of  detention and we’ve brought order back to our border protection regime.

And the US would say, President Trump would say that he went to an election with  this policy, he’s implementing the policy and domestic US policy is an issue for the  US Government.

KIERAN GILBERT:

Pauline Hanson has praised Mr Trump. She says that our Prime Minister hasn’t done  enough in regards to responding to terror. What do you say to that?

PETER DUTTON:

Well I think he’s pretty much on the right path when he’s being attacked by the Left,  he’s being attacked by the Right. I think the Prime Minister has taken a responsible  stance in his public comments about a very trusted ally, a very important ally for the  future of this country and ultimately it’s not within the responsibility of the Australian  Prime Minister to comment on US domestic policy. I think the Prime Minister pointed  that out very openly yesterday. I think he took the right approach and that’s certainly  the approach that the Government will be taking.

KIERAN GILBERT:

So it’s not just about protecting the deal that you and Mr Turnbull secured with the  previous administration in terms of resettlement of refugees off Nauru and Manus?

PETER DUTTON:

Well that was a successful arrangement. It was a very intense negotiation with the  Obama Administration and we are very grateful to President Trump and to Secretary  Kelly and others for the work that they’ve done in transitioning this arrangement into  their own Administration.

KIERAN GILBERT:

And you don’t want to jeopardise that by having a crack at them, is that the plan?

PETER DUTTON:

I want to get people off Nauru and Manus - there’s no secret about that - Labor put  people on Nauru and Manus. We’ve tidied up the mess of border protection. We’ve  secured our borders and I now want to get as a priority women and children off  Nauru and I want to get people off Nauru and Manus in toto as quickly as possible.

We have struck an arrangement with the US. President Trump has said that he will  honour that arrangement that was presided over by the Obama Administration and  we will continue to work with our good friends in the US to see that achieved.

KIERAN GILBERT:

Mr Shorten is calling on the Government to alter its reaction because of what he  says is an appalling ban. We’ve also seen Jeff Bleich make a comment, the former  Ambassador to Australia, the most recent Ambassador - not the most recent  Ambassador the previous one to Ambassador Berry - but obviously he is close to  the Democrats, he’s described this as a cruel measure that violates the tenets of  American democracy.

PETER DUTTON:

Well look, all I can say about Bill Shorten is what people have said to me over  Christmas and that is that he’s not a person to be trusted. The people who know Bill  Shorten most - those colleagues around him and those within the upper echelons of  the union movement - know that this is a man that can’t be trusted.

Bill Shorten’s rash outburst on Twitter demonstrates, frankly, that’s he’s not fit to be  the Australian prime minister. He has made statements that are incorrect. They’re at  odds with the stated policy of the United States - so either he is poorly informed or  he is despite to try to out court the Left because Richard Di Natale’s call for the US  alliance to be broken was reckless and irresponsible.

Mr Shorten is in a battle with the people on the Left and votes on the Left of his own  Party, and within communities, and frankly Mr Shorten for his own political gain, has  sacrificed the national interest which I think is irresponsible for a man who wants to  take the highest office in this land.

KIERAN GILBERT:

He’s not just being true to his vales? That’s what he would argue?

PETER DUTTON:

I think he is being a political opportunist and he’s put his own political interest ahead  of the national interest and a man that does that is not fit to be prime minister of this  country. I think Australians know - as I said you know you speak to hundreds of  people over Christmas that stop and have a chat, meet them at barbeques, see them  at social functions - people really do not trust Bill Shorten. I think the Labor Party

knows that. We’re seeing it around the country and I think he demonstrated it and  underscored how unfit he is to occupy the Leader of the Oppositions role.

His responsibility in relation to the alliance, in relation to national security matters is  absolutely paramount in the Australian political system and he failed that  fundamental test.

KIERAN GILBERT:

I just want to conclude where we began in relation to our response to the Trump  Executive Order. Is there any prospect that Australia follows something similar given  our tradition has been quite different to that, a non-discriminatory immigration  programme?

PETER DUTTON:

The short answer is no, but the reason why Kieran is that the US has announced this  90 day ban because they want to look at screening processes. This is not about  putting a blanket ban in place for people of particular religion or from a particular  country - it is to look at people movements across the US border and they will  decide whether or not the screening process is adequate in the current security  environment - that’s the intent of President Trump.

We already have in place a world leading border protection system. We’ve  demonstrated that. It’s different for Australia because we are an island nation and  the threat for us is not by aircraft, because we have airport liaison officers, we have  probably the most stringent testing regime and screening regime in the world and  we’re able to conduct those tests now under the existing settings and that’s the  system we’ve got in place. We have no plans to change it.

KIERAN GILBERT:

Mr Dutton, appreciate your time. Thanks.

PETER DUTTON:

Thanks Kieran, thank you.
