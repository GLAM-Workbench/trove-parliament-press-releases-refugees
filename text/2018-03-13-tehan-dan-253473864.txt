Investing in Australian communities

The Turnbull Government is funding innovative community projects that target  disadvantage and encourage a sense of community.

The Strong and Resilient Communities grants program will support 83 organisations with  a total of $36.6 million in Government funding.

The successful local projects cover diverse activities across urban, rural, and remote  communities in all states and territories.

The projects were selected to encourage social inclusion and a sense of belonging, to  build wellbeing, safety, and prosperity in communities.

This investment complements the Government's national priorities of creating a safer  Australia and helping people get into employment.

The funding includes $2 million to go towards six national research projects that will  investigate social cohesion, women at risk, racism, refugees, employment, and youth  interventions.

The research findings will provide valuable information to help address the needs of  Australian communities.

The multi-year projects are funded up to 30 June 2021.

More information on Strong and Resilient Communities grants is available on the DSS  website.
