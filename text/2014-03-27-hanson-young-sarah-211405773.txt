Senate disallows TPVs for a second time

The Senate has voted to support a Greens’ disallowance motion and has struck out the  Government’s attempt to reintroduce the use of temporary visas for refugees.

“The Coalition tried to reintroduce Temporary Protection Visas through the back door and today  we have struck them out again,” the Greens’ immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.

“By arrogantly ignoring the will of the Parliament the Government is putting refugees across the  country in an impossible position.

“Forcing refugees to choose between returning home to danger or a temporary visa that rules  them out of permanent protection is just cruelty for its own sake.

“Refugees who are found to be owed protection should be given just that.

“Australia’s generous heart is under attack from this Abbott Government who is doing  everything within its power to beat up on vulnerable people asking for our protection.”
