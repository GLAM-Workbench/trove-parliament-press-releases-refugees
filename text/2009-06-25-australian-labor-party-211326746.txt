Further Measures to Improve Disability Rights

Joint Media Release with  The Hon Robert McClelland MP, Attorney-General

Attorney-General, Robert McClelland, today welcomed the passage of the Disability Discrimination  and Other Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill 2008 through Parliament.

The Bill will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our anti discrimination system and clarifies the  obligation of employers, service providers and other parties to remove discriminatory barriers for  people with disabilities.

"These reforms will contribute to ensuring that our laws continue to promote greater equality, equal  opportunity and a fair go for people with disabilities" said Mr McClelland.

The Attorney-General has also signed a declaration under the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity  Act 1986 to enable the Australian Human Rights Commission to conciliate complaints based on  breaches of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.

Mr Shorten said the declaration gives the Commission power to consider disability rights under the  Convention and enables it to report to Government on how the Convention is being implemented.

"People with disabilities will welcome these further steps in recognising their human rights and  contribution to the Australian community," said Mr Shorten.

These steps are a further demonstration of the Rudd Government's commitment to enhancing human  rights for all Australians.
