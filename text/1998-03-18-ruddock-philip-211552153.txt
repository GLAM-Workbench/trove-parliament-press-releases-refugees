Immigration  Reform:  The Unfinished  Agenda



Speech presented at the National Press Club, Canberra,  Wednesday, 18 March 1998.





Immigration Reform:  The Unfinished Agenda

Please check against delivery.





When I was first invited to appear at this luncheon, I felt that I was being asked to 'please explain' the  government's policies on immigration.

I am more than happy to do so, but I will do so on my own terms, and not on anybody else's.

I come to talk to you today about Australia's immigration program in its totality.

Not the normal 30 second news grabs about being 'swamped by Asians', about rorts, or grannies left  abandoned on immigration office steps, or about tax transfers or the impact upon budgets, or numbers  of people moving in and out of the country.

I want to talk to you about migration and what it means to Australia, to the individuals involved:

* to tell you why the Coalition Government considers it an important part of our overall picture for  Australia's development

* of how it contributes to Australia's positioning as a nation facing the conundrums and challenges of a  new millennium.

You see, migration is not just about numbers, of counting the movement of people coming in and out of  the country. It's not just about the economic costs and benefits.

It’s about the way in which we see ourselves as a nation:

* how we respond to the pressures of being part of a global economy

* how we respond to the grave human crises facing the peoples of the world

* how we seek to position ourselves so that we are able to make and enforce our own decisions about  our future.

For the individuals who decide to make Australia their home, migration is a complex matter.

* It's sometimes about finding a better life for their children and family

* for some it might be the excitement and challenge of testing their resourcefulness and ability to  adapt to new and challenging environments

* for others it's a question of life and death.

But before I go into those matters, I want to put to rest, here and for all time, the fanciful proposition,  that even if we wanted to, we could shut down Australia's migration program completely.

* The migration program is not some sort of tap that we can turn on and off at will

* it is not some sort of luxury commodity that we can only afford in times of economic prosperity.

In an environment that is increasingly mobile, where Australians are travelling more and more  overseas, where investment and labour are increasingly on the move, where information technology,  television, music, the internet, and intermarriage link us directly to the rest of the world, such a  proposition is not only undesirable, frankly, it's impossible.

This proposition has at its core, the mistaken belief that Australia is one of the few countries in the  world that has a migration program at all and that this somehow makes it a social experiment that no-one in their right mind should be involved.

This is demonstrably absurd.

I do not know of a single country in the world that doesn't allow the entry and settlement of spouses and  refugees; tourists and temporary workers; business people and children of citizens.

In Holland, for example, a nation of approximately the same number of people as Australia, around 68  000 migrants enter the country each year. Holland also has a generous refugee resettlement program.

Yet it does not call itself a migration country.

* It does not have an official migration program.

* It does not have in place an extensive and sensitive network of settlement services.

Equally, Germany, whose official policy is 'neither to be nor to become a country of immigration', has an  migrant population of nearly 7.3 million, or 8.9 per cent of its total population.

The United Kingdom, another so-called 'non-migration' country admitted in the order of 154 000  migrants in 1994-95.

Again, these are largely spouses, children, other family members and refugees.

In my wide-ranging recent consultations and open public meetings, no one has suggested that  Australian citizens be denied the right to bring home their life partner.

* No one has suggested that we stop extending a compassionate welcome to people fleeing  persecution.

* No one has suggested that we prevent entirely, the entry of skilled workers on a temporary or  permanent basis.

* No one has suggested that we prohibit visitors from entering and sharing the many wondrous  beauties of this great land

* No one has suggested that we slam the doors to overseas students.

So the question is not how do we stop migration, but how do we manage it to gain the best outcomes  for Australia.

The response of the government of Australia, of this government, is that we should determine the  answer to that question.

It is the government, not some sectional interests, or loud intolerant individual voices, or ill-defined  international interests, or, might I say, the courts that determines who shall and shall not enter this  country, and on what terms.

This is the defining feature of Australia's migration program.

It is not that we shouldn't have one.

Imagine a country like Australia at the turn of the century, where a White Australia Policy was all  encompassing, excluding all of the peoples of the world, that is, that we decided not to have any kind of  migration at all.

What would we have become?

* An insular, unpopulated nation dependent upon the patronage of larger more powerful neighbours.

Or would we have allowed, as some of Europe has done, the mass inflow of guest workers, of people  who had no entitlement to the rights of ordinary citizens.

Would we have allowed this second class citizenry to continue for generations?

If we had been so short-sighted we would have now, upwards of 40 per cent of the Australian  population as guest workers—a population of effective non-citizens, with no commitment to the future  of this land.

We would not have been able to celebrate, as we did recently, the achievement of the Young  Australian of the Year—Tan Le—a young, committed Australian whose vision for this nation is one we  should all proudly embrace as our own.

We would not have seen a five-minute standing ovation for this young Vietnamese refugee whose  value as a human being has been questioned only by ignorant and bigoted voices.

Those who applauded this young woman, not only applauded her individual courage and  achievements, but, I suspect, applauded themselves for being members of a community that, as she  said in her acceptance speech, welcomed her so unquestioningly.

* It is at these times that my optimism soars.

* It is these moments that debunk the absurd accusation that Australians are racist.

It is at these times that my personal commitment to migration and the benefits of multiculturalism is re-affirmed.

It is a commitment, I am proud to say, that the government shares.

It is my job to ensure that the program has integrity, that it delivers all manner of benefits, both human  and economic, to Australia.

To restore integrity to the program and regain the confidence of the Australian people are the reasons  that the government and I have undertaken the extensive reform agenda that we have implemented  and that I will outline for you now.

The lnheritance

The Coalition Government inherited a set of immigration policies and programs that were badly in need  of reform:

* I know that sounds like the traditional catch-cry of any new Government;

* but in the area of immigration, it was perhaps more true than in any other area that I can imagine.

Under Labor, the immigration levels had been allowed to grow for three years in a row with no  explanation or rationale for this growth being given to the Australian people:

* I suspect that even parts of the Labour Party did not understand what was happening.

* the program had come to be dominated by the Family Stream while some of the skill  supplementation categories allowed entry of people with relatively poor employment prospects;

* immigration policies and practices had become inadequate in preventing abuses and rorts;

* worst of all, the Australian community was treated with disdain when it came to explaining what was  going on.

In essence, the Australian Labour Party in Government, was almost single-handedly responsible for  destroying the Australian community's confidence in immigration policies and programs;

* Australians no longer saw them as operating in the national interest;

* in many ways, these policies and programs provided fertile ground for the emergence of intolerance  and in some cases outright racism.

Restoring the community's confidence in our immigration programs and policies has been difficult and it  is likely to take a little while yet:

* but restore the community's confidence in such policies and programs we must;

* our immigration policies and programs are fundamental to our future;

* a negative attitude will only fuel intolerance;

* it will also mean that the significant benefits of immigration, both temporary and permanent, may be  lost.

As most of you would know, I have a long-standing and deep commitment to an immigration program  that does not discriminate on the grounds of race, religion, ethnic origin or nationality;

* to me, our cultural diversity is a source of great strength;

* our immigration program is something to be protected and nurtured;

But this cannot be done if we do not take a rigorous approach to the development and application of  our immigration policies and practices;

* the Australian community must have confidence that our immigration rules are applied fairly and  consistently;

* the community must have confidence that our immigration programs are operating truly in the  national interest.

It is with these objectives in mind that the Coalition has set about the arduous task of reform.

* I have been systematically reviewing each area of immigration to ensure that it operates in the  national interest;

* Very major progress has been made.

I intend today to outline some of this progress; a summary of which is provided in the fact sheet  available at the front door;

* but I also know that there is a long way to go before we have fully regained the Australian  community's confidence in our immigration policies and programs;

Later today, I will provide some indications of the directions of future changes - our 'unfinished agenda'.

Integrity and a ‘Fair-Go'

Nothing undermines community confidence in our immigration policies more than sham marriages,  'queue jumping' and people using our review and judicial provisions to delay departure:

* equally, the community has a right to be angry when it sees migrant sponsors not fulfilling their  obligations.



It is for these reasons that I have made integrity and a 'fair-go' one of the hallmarks of my approach to  immigration policy and administration.

When we came to government, the Spouse, Prospective Marriage and Interdependency categories  were subject to unacceptable abuse.

Sham marriages and the like were contributing to a serious lowering of public confidence in the whole  program. On 3 July 1996 I announced a number of changes to tackle this issue head on.

These measures were centred on a far more rigorous assessment process for these categories, a  greater rate of interviews, and interviews for all de facto spouse and interdependent applicants.

The results have been dramatic.

Compared with two years ago, offshore applications have fallen by 45 per cent and onshore  applications by 23 per cent.

* Non-genuine applicants are being deterred from trying their luck.

* Non-genuine applicants who do apply are being effectively identified by the new measures: refusal  rates have more than doubled over the same period and there has been no commensurate increase  in requests for review.



But it was in the courts where the most corrosive actions against an effective and fair immigration  program were taking place.

Applications for judicial review in the refugee area, for example, were growing exponentially as  significant numbers of individuals abused the protection visa system by applying for protection visas  simply to:

* prolong their stay in Australia;

* obtain work rights;

* access Medicare;

* and, if they were in financial hardship, obtain Asylum Seeker Assistance (ASA).

To give you an idea of the extent of the problem:

* the number of Protection visa applications has increased from around 500 per annum in the late  1980s to around 11 000 per annum today.

* And many of these applications came from nationals of countries where clearly there is no threat of  persecution. We have even had people from places like Canada and Ireland claiming asylum.

Over the four years since the establishment of the Refugee Review Tribunal (RRT), 10 008 decisions to  refuse refugee status or Protection Visas were taken by my Department and upheld by the RRT

* Of these, 979 then appealed to the federal court: 21 were ultimately successful.

* This whole process cost the Australian taxpayer approximately $20 million.

One of the chief reasons for establishing the RRT was to reduce the number of appeals going to the  courts.

However, recourse to the courts following unsuccessful Immigration Review Tribunal (IRT) and RRT  appeals has increased—not decreased

* since the introduction of the tribunals, such recourse has ballooned from around 250 applicants to  over 900 in 1997.

* Migration matters now make up 65 per cent of the Federal Court's administrative law caseload.

Delays associated with litigation have also grown significantly



* in refugee cases the average length of time between me date of application and judicial decision has  trebled in three years.

This is just not on.

Obviously much public money is being expended on the growing sport of appealing the carefully  considered decisions of my Department.

But even more importantly, genuine refugees are being caught in this rush to appeal and their cases  are being unacceptably delayed because of those seeking to abuse the system.

We must have a system that is fair to applicants for immigration visas but it should also be fair to the  Australian taxpayer.

We need a system that operates in me public interest—a fair system that is also efficient.

Our response has again been forthright.

* We have introduced into Parliament measures to narrow the scope of judicial review by the courts of  cases that have already been considered on their merits by departmental officers and independent  review tribunals.



This was passed by the House of Representatives on 24 September 1997. The chief effect will be that  tribunal decisions cannot be overturned by the courts as long as me decision in question is a bona fide  exercise of power by the decision-maker. This bill is currently awaiting debate in the Senate.

If passed by the Senate, these measures, together with other legislation to streamline the operation of  the review tribunals, will cut both me cost and the time taken by judicial review but retain me fairness of  me system.

If anyone doubts that such reforms are needed let me remind you that, at the moment the fastest 25  per cent of cases in the Immigration Review Tribunal take an average of 75 days and the slowest 25  per cent take 589 days. The longest an applicant has had to wait for a decision from the IRT is 2073  days (5.5 years)!

This is appalling.

Other measures have also been taken which should reduce the current abuse of the Protection Visa  system, whereby people apply for a Protection Visa solely to gain access to work rights and Medicare.

Restoring the integrity of our borders

As well as our determination to safeguard the integrity of our immigration program we are also  determined to safeguard the integrity of the nation's borders and to protect the Australian public from  the entry of people who have serious criminal backgrounds.

The Government must be able to ensure that non-citizens who are not of good character do not  enter Australia,

* or if they do enter or commit crimes while in Australia, it is essential mat they can be removed  quickly.

There have been a number of cases where merits review bodies have overturned visa refusal and  deportation decisions involving people who have been convicted in relation to serious sexual assault  (by that I mean rape), manslaughter, armed robbery or fraud involving millions of dollars.

Only two weeks ago a decision to deport a man was overturned by the Federal Court although he had  been convicted and served a gaol sentence for possessing Heroin with an estimated street value of $3  million.

Again, the courts have reinterpreted and re-written Australian law—ignoring the sovereignty of  Parliament and the will of the Australian people.

Again, this is simply not on.

These cases graphically illustrate the need for action to redress inadequacies in me existing legislation.

The government is implementing a number of measures that will strengthen character decision-making,  ensuring that the Australian Community can re-assert their rights to be protected from such individuals.

I have introduced into Parliament a Bill which will enable the government to regain the initiative and be  able to take quick, decisive and effective action to refuse or to cancel me visas of non-citizens who are  not of good character.

The Bill is currently before the Senate.

It is crucial that this legislation passes to further enhance community confidence in the integrity of the  migration program.

To date, we have had no indication of support from Labor and the minority parties, that they will pass  this legislation.

However, I am determined to strengthen the character provisions of the Migration Act.

There is strong public support for the Government to take a firm hand in this area, to ensure we protect  the Australian community.

And we will.

Achieving Balance in our Immigration Objectives

The Coalition's immigration policies have sought to achieve a proper balance between the social,  economic, environmental and humanitarian objectives.

As an affluent nation, we have a moral obligation to re-settle our fair share of the world’s refugees;

I want to state very clearly at the outset that our commitment to me resettlement of refugees remains a  central part of our program.

We continue to remain one of the highest resettlement countries in the world, and this is a record of  which I, and the government are proud.

* we must, however, ensure that we focus our contribution on those that are most in need of our  protection - that is people identified by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees;

* since coming to Office, we have taken substantial steps to ensure that genuine refugees take  precedence in our Humanitarian Program;

* this is a focus to which I am strongly committed.

This commitment is reflected, not only in the numbers of refugees that Australia re-settles, but more  importantly, in the extensive and sensitive assistance that we provide to refugees when they arrive.

We have taken a very close look at the sort of settlement assistance we give people who come to this  country under the immigration programs. Our efforts towards an effective settlement process for  migrants are centred on three basic expectations:

* skilled entrants will be essentially self-reliant, able to negotiate Australia's social and economic  systems quickly and effectively with little if any need of assistance from government;

* family migrants, more skilled and with better English than many arriving in the past, are assisted by  their sponsors in the settlement process; and

* humanitarian entrants, arriving as they do, under quite different circumstances, will need help from  government—as well as the community—if they are to have me best chance of settling effectively.

It is this latter group, me 10 000 people who come to Australia every year under the Humanitarian  Program, and the estimated 2 000 refugees who are granted Protection visas in Australia, that deserve  our help in settling into their new country and they are our number one settlement priority.

People entering Australia through the humanitarian program have by definition, experienced atrocities  that defy any concept of justice, freedom or human rights.

For almost all, the experience of loss and dislocation of family, country and culture is unparalleled.

Sadly, many people seeking the protection of Australia, including children, have been subjected to  torture and trauma, which if left unacknowledged and untreated, can have devastating long-term effects  upon their health and well being.

When combined with the more general refugee experience, the impact of such odious practices can  compromise their chances for effective resettlement.

They require understanding and well planned service provision to enable the courage demonstrated by  their survival to carry them into a new life in Australia.

In order to achieve this, the Government initiated the Integrated Humanitarian Settlement Scheme, to  ensure the proper coordination and integration of essential services.

The goal of such an initiative is to ensure that the hardship and trauma experienced in the past will not  prevent them from becoming positive and rich contributors to the fabric of Australian society.

At the other end of the spectrum, highly skilled applicants and, where appropriate, their sponsors, must  take responsibility for ensuring that they have undertaken appropriate research on labour market and  cost of living issues and are therefore able to settle into the community and into work without  government assistance.

Of course, they need to be aware of conditions in Australia and my department has made considerable  efforts to ensure that such information is provided on issues including the two year waiting period for  social security benefits and sponsors' responsibilities to support their relatives.

The Government is not resiling from the two year waiting period for social security benefits bearing in  mind that an effective safety net does exist.

Newly arrived migrants do have access to support if they experience a significant change in  circumstances after their arrival.

It is critical that if the Migration Program is to produce maximum benefits for Australia mat we bring in  highly skilled and employable people who can make a contribution to Australia, without needing a high  level of taxpayer funded support.

Such moves will complement measures we are exploring in the points test review to ensure that  migrants are selected who can quickly make a positive contribution to the Australian economy.

Family Migration

Australia's heritage provides us with an obligation to maintain the family stream of our immigration  program.

Understand this - despite the uneasiness it may generate in the more irrational and intolerant amongst  us—we are irrefutably a nation of immigrants. Around 23 per cent of our population is overseas-born  and a further 20 per cent are the first generation children of those migrants.

* the current Family Stream represents around 50 per cent of the Migration (non-Humanitarian)  Program;

* while smaller than in the past, this is still a substantial commitment given the costs associated with  parts of the Family Stream;

* our current Family Stream focuses predominantly on immediate family relationships such as  spouses/fiances and dependent children.

In other words, the majority of the family program is about Australian young people (and sometimes  not-so-young people) going overseas, meeting their Iife's partner and wanting to bring them home.

While this part of the program has been subjected to rorts in the past, we are confident that we have  eliminated them and the family stream will remain an important part of our migration program.



* we have substantially reduced other parts of the Family Stream such as parents, pending a review of  this category of entry;

* our aim with the review will be to identity entry arrangements for parents and other aged relatives  whereby these migrants and their sponsors take on a fairer share of me costs involved with their  resettlement rather than the general taxpayer having to bear these costs.



Skilled Migration

The Skilled Stream now represents almost 50 per cent of the Migration (non-Humanitarian) Program:

* research has consistently shown that if migrants are young, with good English language skills and  vocational skills that are recognised in Australia, they will have a highly positive impact on the  Economy and on Government finances;



* they are an investment in our future;

* but this is not something we can take for granted;

* we must continue to review entry arrangements under these categories to ensure that we are getting  me best possible results;

* I will announce me outcome of our review of the points-tested categories of the Migration Program in  the very near future;

* some of the possible changes we have been looking at include giving bonus points in these  categories for persons with skills that are going to be in high demand in the future;

* we are also looking to provide bonus points for people who have studied in Australia as well as for  people who have already shown they can succeed in the Australian labour market;

* another change may be to more properly recognise thee value of an additional language other than  English in the points test.

The Future

The measures that we have taken and the measures that we propose, I believe, set the scene for the  development of a robust migration program firmly focused on me development of Australia

* firmly focused on ways of growing our economy

* so that we can provide jobs for all Australians

* so that we can provide an optimistic future for our children.

Australia's economic fundamentals are me strongest they have been for decades:

* Unemployment is falling.

* interest rates are low.

* Inflation is at an historic low and steady.

We must position ourselves to make me most of the opportunities these economic conditions provide.

Today, around 80 per cent of Australia's trade is with non-English speaking countries.

Our business profile is equally diverse.

In the last ten years more man 50 000 business migrants have settled in Australia. About 21 per cent of  Australia's 800 000 small businesses are owned or operated by people from different backgrounds.

We are also looking closely at the Student visa program to ensure the controlled, sustainable growth of  Australia's international education and training industry.

Among options I am considering is visa assessment streamlining for students from emerging markets  such as the PRC and India by introducing an effective partnership with education institutions to ensure  that we receive bona-fide students, and not those wanting to jump the queue and achieve a migration  outcome.

In the critical area of tourism, we have developed the electronic travel authority, an invisible visitor visa  obtainable from most travel agents around the world.

In the short period of 18 months, this invisible visa has grown from nothing, to being available to 70 per  cent of tourists visiting Australia. Currently over 40 airlines, some 12 000 travel agents and people from  26 nations participate in the scheme.

Innovations like this have me potential to be sold to other countries and will put us in good stead to  process the millions of people who will visit Australia during the year of the Olympics.

Other recent reforms have resulted in a more streamlined temporary business entry system while  retaining certain labour market safeguards.

* These include new Long Stay Business Visas (457) which are available to allow genuine overseas  business people to obtain visas quickly for periods ranging from 3 months to 4 years.

* They also include me Employer Nomination Scheme (ENS) which enables Australian employers to  nominate overseas personnel for migration when they are unable to fill a vacancy from the Australian  labour market. Overseas applicants are given priority migration processing and on arrival in Australia  go straight into skilled employment. We expect to attract over 5 000 skilled migrants this year under  ENS.



Conclusion

Never more than in recent times have migration and related issues caused such concern and division  within me community. Never before has the program seen such low levels of support and  understanding.

Yet never before has the future been so alive with opportunity.

I think that the reforms that we have implemented, and the reforms yet to come, will bring a new  confidence to Australia.

With these measures in place, we can be confident that we are in control. That we and we alone, are  determining the agenda.

This should give us greater courage to face an everchanging world—

* where we see opportunities instead of threats.

The measures that the government has put in place will mean that we should no longer be afraid of the  extent to which traditional national boundaries are coming down.

We should not be afraid that Australia's national identity and culture is being undermined - it is not.

Some people have criticised Australian leadership of somehow failing to instil a strong sense of  nationalism. This is not true

* we do have a strong and discernible national identity

* we do have a strong and discernible Australian culture.

What we need to avoid is a sense of nationalism that is rife with isolationism and intolerance.

We are not being Asianised, Americanised, Europeanised or anything else—you only need to travel  overseas to know that, and when you return home, Australian-ness is tangible and real— we miss it  when we're away and celebrate it when we come back.

It's the pride in who we are, its our growing confidence in ourselves as a people that we can hold our  own, and better, in a changeable and unforgiving world.

We're reinforcing that pride through measures like establishing the Australian Citizenship Council to  help celebrate the 50th Anniversary of Australian Citizenship.

The Australian people can be confident that we are writing our own script, on our own terms and  playing it our own way, conscious of the opportunities and limitations that the current global scene  presents to us.

Immigration is something that touches the lives of us all.

Everyone I meet knows someone who is involved in the migration of a family member, or friend, or  business acquaintance or visitor or student.

* that might just be the nature of the job, I guess.

But I think that this is just the reality of modern Australia.

* We are, almost all of us here, the sons and daughters of migrants

* We are all sons and daughters of this great land.

Thank you for your kind attention.
