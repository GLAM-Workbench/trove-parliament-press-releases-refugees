Telstra and Ericsson send Mobile Phones to 
Refugee Camps

Â

Following representations by Senator Chris Schacht, who last week 
visited refugee camps in th e Former Yugoslavia Republic of Macedonia, 
I have been informed that Telstra and Ericsson have responded by donating 
mobile phones for use in the refugee camps.

Â

Recent media reports have shown the effectiveness 
of mobile phones in allowing refugees to trace the movements of family 
members and to keep in touch with loved ones.

Â

Ericsson has kindly provided six mobile phones, and 
Telstra will cover call costs up to $10,000.

Â

I thank both Telstra and Ericsson for their generosity 
and compassion with this kind gesture to displaced and suffering people 
half a world away.

Â

CARE Australia will arrange the use and distribution 
of the phones in the refugee camps.
