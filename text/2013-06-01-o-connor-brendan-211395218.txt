Abbott's 'stop the boats' policy in tatters  Saturday, 01 June 2013

The centrepiece of Tony Abbott's immigration policy has been rejected outright by  Indonesia, which will play no part in 'turning back the boats.'

At an official address in Canberra, Indonesian Ambassador, Nadjib Riphat Kesoema  said turning boats away from Indonesia was not the solution.

'The target of turning back the boats is not Indonesia. It should be going to other  countries, to the countries of origin of the people. Indonesia is a transit country and  we are also the victim of this situation. I think it's not possible for the Coalition to say  that it has to go to Indonesia.'

'This is not only the problem of the government, this is not only the problem of  Australia, this is not only the problem of Indonesia, this is the problem of all,' he said.  - Nadjib Riphat Kesoema

The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Brendan O'Connor, said the Opposition  Leader should finally admit his pledge to stop the boats could not be achieved.

'Tony Abbott needs to admit that there is no quick fix to the global problem of asylum  seekers risking their lives to travel to other countries by boat,' Mr O'Connor said.

'Maybe now instead of saying no to Malaysia, the Opposition will say yes to the  solution of a regional approach, as recommended by the independent Expert Panel  on Asylum Seekers and backed by the Government.

'The sooner Tony Abbott admits that this is a workable solution for Australia to this  worldwide problem, the sooner we will stop the people smugglers from taking the life  savings of innocent people, and too often their lives.'
