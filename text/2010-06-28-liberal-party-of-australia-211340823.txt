TIM COX:

Tony Abbott, good morning.

TONY ABBOTT:

Good Morning, nice to be with you.

TIM COX:

A week of course is a long time, dot dot dot dot dot… You’ve been reading the  papers, I’m sure, on your flights this morning. What have you made of the news and  of course those polls results?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think the new Government’s… well, it’s not really a new Government, I think the  new Prime Minister is getting a bit of a predictable bounce but I think people will  soon work out that it’s the same old government and changing the title from Deputy  Prime Minister or Acting Prime Minister to Prime Minister hasn’t really changed the  problems that she’s got to deal with and if she can’t fix the problems she won’t keep  the headlines fixed for very long.

TIM COX:

Irrespective, though, of how well she performs, is it likely that because she isn’t  Kevin Rudd, if there were an election say in four weeks or five week, six weeks, that  perhaps she would enjoy the support of the electorate merely because she isn’t Mr  Rudd?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think there’s going to be a certain amount of novelty value for a while but in the end  it’s the policies that count and it’s the ability of the Government to solve the problems  which counts, and the interesting thing is that nearly all of these problems are

problems of the Government’s own making. I mean, if the Government hadn’t  mucked up our policy we wouldn’t have these boats arriving; if the Government  hadn’t had this silly idea about the mining tax we wouldn’t have the investment strike,  we wouldn’t have the dollar under pressure, we wouldn’t have the share market under  pressure. If Julia Gillard hadn’t come up with the Building the Education Revolution

programme we wouldn’t have the problem of waste of money. So, these are all self-inflicted problems and the Government needs to fix them but I don’t know that that’s  going to persuade people because people will ask about the Government’s judgment  and values in the first place.

TIM COX:

And what will it mean for you and the Coalition and the way you will lead the  Coalition, for your policy direction et cetera?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, our policy direction is pretty clear. I released a 12 Point Action Plan for  Australia on the weekend and our position is clear regardless of who leads the  Government. We believe in smaller government, lower taxes, greater freedom. We  believe in a fair go for families. We believe in respect for values which have stood the  test of time. We believe in policies that work. We believe in not trifling with people’s

future, that’s the stuff that we believe in and I think that’s been pretty clear, but how  can Julia Gillard as Prime Minister fix up the mess that she helped to create as Acting  Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister. I don’t think that’s clear at all.

TIM COX:

That’s the interesting thing, isn’t it, that certainly in the eyes of those people polled  clearly they don’t see that had a hand to play in the Resources Super Profits Tax  debacle for example and other issues. She’s seen as being you know, coming in  unsullied.

TONY ABBOTT:

I think there’s always this novelty value and obviously the novelty value is a little bit  greater in that she’s the first female Prime Minister and as the father of three  daughters, obviously, it’s nice to have this demonstration that there’s no position in  the country that’s barred to women, but the fact is here in northern Tasmania there are  hundreds of jobs at risk from the mining tax. I don’t think she’s going to fix that  problem. I think she’s going to try to massage over the headlines, she’s going to try to

keep the miners talking for the next few weeks but I think everyone knows that if  Labor gets re-elected the mining industry is going to get hit with this great big new  tax and that will be terrible for jobs, certainly here in northern Tasmania but it’ll be  bad for jobs right around the country because in the end the mining industry is vital  for jobs everywhere, not just mining jobs but for all the other jobs that depend upon  the buoyant economy that the mining industry helps to produce.

TIM COX:

Do you think though that the show of good will from the miners that she called for  last week suggests that there will at least be some negotiation, something, that  intransigence that existed before perhaps is no longer there?

TONY ABBOTT:

She still hasn’t talked about compromise - that’s one word that hasn’t escaped her lips  - and the fact is that if she does negotiate seriously she’s going to have to radically  change this tax. The only good way to change the tax is to dump it all together, and if  she changes the tax, there’ll have to be a mini-Budget, a very urgent mini-Budget, to  change the spending which the Government has promised. So, she’s essentially in the  same dilemma that Kevin Rudd had. She can’t change the tax without destroying her  Budget, but she can’t keep the tax without really badly damaging the economy for  many years to come.

TIM COX:

Where does Tasmania fit in your plans? You’re in the north west, you’ve got the  newly endorsed candidate for Braddon today. Of course, you go into this election not  holding any of the five lower house seats.

TONY ABBOTT:

Obviously, if we’re going to win we’ve got to win some seats in Tasmania and so  that’s why I’m here. I think it’s very important that the people of Tasmania know that  if they want to protect their jobs, they need to have a change of government in  Canberra.

TIM COX:

Do you think that the mining sector in Tasmania, not a huge sector but an important  one, sees the same sort of issue, priority of issues that you do?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I think that for the people of northern Tasmania this Savage River mine is pretty  important. There’s about 700 jobs dependent upon it and given that you’ve had  hundreds of jobs lost in the Wesley Vale paper mill closures, you’ve had jobs lost in

forestry, I think it’s very important that we don’t lose any more jobs and who would  want to put the Savage River mine at risk under those circumstances?

TIM COX:

We’ll talk about it more, I’m sure, as polling day approaches, always good to have  you along this morning. Tony Abbott, many thanks.

TONY ABBOTT:

Tim, I really appreciate the chance to say g’day.
