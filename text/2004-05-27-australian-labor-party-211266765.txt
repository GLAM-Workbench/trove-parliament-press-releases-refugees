In Defence of the United Nations

Australian Commitment to Multilateralism in the  Post-Iraq Order

An Address to

The Sydney Institute



Kevin Rudd, MP

Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs and International  Security

27 May 2004



When you’re in the middle of a major international event, it’s difficult,  if not impossible, to understand what its long-term significance might  be.

Unfortunately, that is where we now find ourselves with Iraq.

Will domestic security be able to be returned to Iraq?

Will the Brahimi Plan for the political transformation of Iraq succeed?

Will Iraq represent the first or last neo-conservative experiment in the  democratisation of the greater Middle East?

And will Iraq represent the first or the last hurrah for the doctrine of  global military pre-emption?

We do not yet know the answer to any of these questions.

But what we do know is that the Iraq war has represented a  fundamental assault on the post-war international system.

1

As one of the co-architects of that system back in 1945, we in this  country face a stark challenge.

Will we be party to the incremental destruction of the UN multilateral  system?

Or in the aftermath of Iraq, will we now play a constructive role in the  rebuilding of that system?

This is not an academic question.

It’s a real and practical question facing Australian diplomacy today.

Defining Multilateralism

Multilateralism can best be defined as a system of rules, institutions and  patterns of cooperation between states to deal with common threats to  their security and prosperity.

Multilateralism rests on three basic principles:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ An open, fair, rules-based system governing international  behaviour;  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The development of global strategies within the framework of  this rules-based system to deal with common threats and

common opportunities; and  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The application of political, economic and, where collectively  authorised, military sanctions when these rules are fundamentally

breached.



Multilateralism, of course, does not represent the exclusive machinery  of the international system. Bilateralism and regionalism also play a  major role - but these are at their best when they conform to, and  complement the multilateral system as a whole.

These fundamental principles of multilateralism are reflected in the UN  Charter and the United Nations Organisation which it created.

2



It’s worth reflecting for a moment on the objects of the United  Nations, first articulated in 1945:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ To save succeeding generations from the scourge of war;  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ To reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights;  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ To promote social progress and better standards of life in larger  freedom.

In the half century that has passed since the United Nations adopted  these high ideals, wars have not stopped. Human rights continue to be  abused. And some parts of the world have seen very little social and  economic progress.

But before we engage in hearty, collective ridicule of the UN of the  type populist politicians so enjoy, it is worth recalling for a moment the  absolute magnitude of the human destruction wrought during the three  proceeding centuries of the largely rule-free post-Westphalian order.

The Napoleonic wars, the Crimean War, the Franco-Prussian War, the  war to end all wars, and twenty years later the world war that  succeeded the war to end all wars. Not to mention the Holocaust. Not  to mention the wars of colonial invasion and occupation across Asia,  Africa and Latin America.

A combined human carnage of untold millions.

So when pedestrian, provincial politicians today remind us that the  United Nations has not succeeded in living up to all its expectations, we  should, with some humility, agree. We should also recall Churchill’s  great aphorism about democracy: Democracy, the worst system of  government in the world, apart from all the others.

The United Nations: the worst system of international government in  the world, apart from all the others.

3

Of course the United Nations does not represent the totality of the  multilateral system.

While nominally under the purview of the UN’s Economic and Social  Council, the Bretton Woods institutions - the five organisations that  make up the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund - are to  all intents and purposes independent.

So too is the World Trade Organisation which together with the Bank  and the Fund complete the global economic architecture.

The International Labour Organisation predates the war and was  designed to advance international labour standards.

Beyond these institutions again lie a myriad of specialised organisations  dealing with a range of legal, technical and commercial matters - from  postal services, intellectual property and civil aviation, to meteorology.

What all these institutions have in common, however, is the simple  principle that cooperative behaviour is generally better than unilateral  behaviour in achieving global outcomes.

Defending Multilateralism

So in defending multilateralism, what are the principal arguments to  bring to bear?

First, a rules-based system, however imperfect, is better than no system  at all.

Rules-based systems, when determined consensually, help define  fairness.

They can also deliver efficiency where competitive or duplicative  systems would otherwise be dysfunctional.

Most importantly, rules-based systems constitute the primary basis of  legitimacy in international behaviour.

It is instructive to note that despite the derision with which the  Australian Government treated the United Nations in the lead up to the  Iraq war, the Australian Government, together with the other  Occupying Powers, felt constrained to at least try and construct an  international legal legitimacy underpinning their decision to go to war  based on an arcane interpretation of previous Security Council  resolutions.

Just as they subsequently sought the legitimisation delivered by Security  Council resolutions 1483 and 1511 to define their powers for the  period of the occupation.

Just as the Occupying Powers now seek to engage the United Nations  as a further mechanism of international legitimisation - both in securing  future international participation within Iraq, as well as conferring  legitimacy on the political transformation process within Iraq itself.

It is instructive to recall that in the first half of the last century, no such  legitimisation was sought or invoked by the Great Powers as they  embarked upon the First and Second World Wars.

At minima, the UN Charter at least offers this modest constraint, given  that all states now accept the international legal principle that it is  unlawful to invade another state in the absence of authorisation under  the UN Charter.

Beyond the simple argument that some rules are better than no rules, a  second argument in favour of multilateralism is that the changing nature  of the international terrain itself mandates greater levels of international  cooperation.

Put simply, global challenges require global solutions.

We’ve seen this with economic globalisation and the global regulatory  responses that have become necessary to govern international capital  transfers, the international trade goods and services, as well as a rules  governing intellectual property.

5



More recently, the international community has become increasingly  conscious of the globalisation of security. Terrorism, international  organised crime, international people smuggling and the international  narcotics trade require international, not just national, responses.

Of course, this has been the case with global climate change and other  global environmental challenges for some time.

Kyoto rests on the unremarkable assumption that the only valid  response to global warming should be a global one - although this  unremarkable logic still appears to escape the comprehension of the  current Government.

The central point is this: that the nature of the policy terrain that the  international community now faces is the collapse of the so-called  “great divide” between the national and international, the external and  the internal, the foreign and the domestic.

And for this fundamental reason, the sheer quantum of security policy,  economic policy and environmental policy activity that is now shifting  to an increasingly seamless trans-national domain - demands trans-national responses, if responses are to be effective, rather than  cosmetic.

The third critical reason in defence of UN multilateralism is that it  affords middle powers like Australia an ability to punch above their  weight.

It was for this reason that Australia was able to influence the shape of  the UN Charter of the UN Organisation in the first place. Evatt used  the dynamics of the San Francisco Conference to become the  spokesman for small and middle powers - thereby delivering  fundamental changes to the eventual shape of the UN Charter  compared to the draft that had been agreed by the Great Powers at  Dumbarton Oaks the year before.

6

Since then, successive Australian Labor Governments have been active  multilateral players: on security, through the Australia Group  coordinating export controls on chemical and biological weapons,  materials and dual use items; the negotiation of the Chemical Weapons  Convention and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty; as well as  delivering a comprehensive peace settlement in Cambodia.

Similarly, previous Labor Governments have sought to use the Cairns  Group within the World Trade Organisation agenda to advance the  interests of agricultural trade liberalisation.

The capacity for Australia unilaterally to have delivered similar policy  outcomes would have been negligible.

Furthermore, those who argue against UN multilateralism need to ask  themselves the following, fundamental counter-factual questions:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ If the UN Security Council did not exist, there could never have  been an Australian-led intervention in East Timor.  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ If the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia  had not been established, Slobodan Milosevic may never have

been brought to justice;   Ã¢ÂÂ¢ If the UNHCR did not exist, an estimated 50 million refugees  would not have been helped to start new lives over the past five

decades and 12 million internally and internationally displaced  persons today would be without any form of protection.  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ If the World Health Organisation didn’t exist, there would have  been no body to coordinate an effective international response to

the SARS outbreak.  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ If the World Food Program did not exist, 70 million fewer  people wouldn’t be fed and kept alive each year.   Ã¢ÂÂ¢ If UNICEF did not exist, millions of children’s lives would have

been lost.   Ã¢ÂÂ¢ And if the Montreal Protocol did not exist, over 180 countries  may not have made legally binding commitments to reduce their

consumption of chemicals harming the Ozone Layer.

7



Finally, the UN manages to achieve these outcomes on the basis of a  relatively modest core budget.  The UN’s core budget is around  US$1.3 billion per year, which is less than Australia’s total annual aid  budget of US$1.49 billion per year.

The entire UN system (including UN peacekeeping operations, UN  programs, funds and specialised agencies) spends around US$12 billion  annually. Once again, to put this into context this represents 10 per  cent of the Australian Government’s 2004/05 total budget of  US$134.6 billion.

This does not mean that the UN multilateral system does not need to be  reformed. That its powers need to be better defined. That better  decision making processes need to be established. That greater  efficiencies need to be gained.

But these are arguments in support of the UN multilateral system.

They are not arguments to dismantle the UN multilateral system - or  to stand passively by while the system slowly falls into disuse.



Historical Commitment to the UN

Labor’s approach to foreign policy is based on three pillars:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Our alliance with the United States;  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Our membership of the United Nations; and   Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Our policy of comprehensive engagement with Asia.

It has been the Australian Labor Party which has given effect to these  principles in the post-war government of Australia.

It was Labor under Curtin that took Australia into our alliance with the  United States.

8

It was Labor under Whitlam that took Australia into Asia.

And it was Labor under Evatt that took Australia into the United  Nations.

As noted above, Bert Evatt made a significant contribution to the UN  Charter and the early staffing of the UN organisation. An Australian  was the first President of the UN Security Council. An Australian was  the third President of the UN General Assembly - in the person of  Evatt himself.

Evatt, in addressing the United Nations Association of Australia in 1949  stated with some eloquence:

“International peace and justice can be achieved only by building  on the United Nations: those who would destroy it are pointing  the road to chaos. It is no good supporting the principles when  they suit us and abandoning them when they appear to be to our  temporary disadvantage. Australia has consistently stood for the  Charter and its application to all disputes and problems. It is for  that reason that Australia’s international prestige stands very  high.”

Evatt’s words, half a century later, continue to ring in our ears as we  confront Australia’s contemporary circumstances: a government which  derided the United Nations last year, but a government desperately  seeking to cling to UN legitimacy this year now that events have turned  very badly in Iraq.

Evatt had a broad view of the United Nations - broader than simply the  maintenance of international security. In the same 1949 lecture, Evatt  stated:

“The United Nations does not belong to governments, or  diplomats or officials: it belongs to the people. It exists to give  effect to their desire for a world of peace, justice, freedom and  welfare. All men of good will yearn for such a world, not so  much for themselves as for their children…”

9



Here was Evatt translating basic social democratic values into the  international domain. Values of security. Values of democracy. Values  of prosperity. Values of equality. Values of fairness.

For Labor, our basic values have never stopped at the continental shelf.  They are as valid in guiding our domestic policy orientation as they are  in guiding our international policy orientation.

Evatt was responsible for drafting the economic and social chapters of  the UN Charter, creating ECOSOC and, in time, its associated  economic and social institutions, organisations and agencies.

And to these enduring Labor values, half a century later we add the  value of sustainability. Valid domestically. Valid internationally. Global  sustainability being the common cause of our collective humanity.

Labor’s support for the UN Charter and the United Nations  Organisation remains unabated this last half century. Under Whitlam.  Under Hawke. Under Keating.

And I’ve already noted Australia’s considerable diplomatic  achievements under these governments - most notably those of Foreign  Minister Evans on Cambodia and disarmament and Trade Minister  Cook through the Cairns Group.

When you actually look at the record, it’s amazing what a country like  Australia has been able to achieve through an activist diplomacy  working through the multilateral system.

Japanese foreign policy academics, having analysed Australia’s foreign  policy achievements through the Hawke and Keating period, have  produced research papers advocating Australia as an effective middle  power model for the future direction of foreign policy activism by  Japan.

Attitude of the Howard Government

10

Until recently, there has been bipartisan support in Australia for the  UN multilateral system.

As Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser stated in Parliament in June 1976:

“In a world where increasingly complex problems transcend  national boundaries, a commitment to multilateral cooperation,  particularly in the field of economic and social development, is an  indispensable part of Australian foreign policy. We support the  United Nations, its Charter and the work of its various  specialised agencies…Australia will make every effort to help the  organisation expand its effectiveness. We shall be seeking  opportunities to work cooperatively within the United Nations  framework as in other multilateral forums.”

However in recent years, this bipartisan consensus has regrettably  broken down. We have seen it in what the Howard Government has  had to say about the United Nations. We have also seen it by a series of  things the Howard Government has done in response to the United  Nations.

It is a pattern of behaviour that predates Iraq.

In 1998, Mr Reith attacked the UN’s International Labour Organisation  for daring to question his handling of the 1998 waterfront dispute.

In March 2000, Foreign Minister Downer unleashed on the UN  Commission on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination for having the  audacity to critique Australia’s mandatory sentencing laws on the  detention of aboriginal people.

In 2002, Foreign Minister Downer unleashed on the United Nations  High Commissioner for Refugees over its criticism of the  Government’s approach to the mandatory detention of asylum seekers.  Mr Downer said that:

“…Australia didn’t appreciate ill-informed criticism of  Australia’s policy from international organisations such as some

11

of the United Nations’ agencies…and that such criticism  undermines international support for UN agencies…It’s not what  we pay the United Nations to do.”

This was followed by Prime Minister Howard at the outbreak of the  Iraq war when he attacked the Security Council when he stated:

“I believe that if the UN Security Council walks away from its  responsibilities [in Iraq] it weakens its authority, perhaps fatally.”

And just in case the international community had not got the message  by then, Foreign Minister Downer, in a fit of post war triumphalism,  stated that:

“Increasingly multilateralism is a synonym for ineffective and  unfocused policy involving internationalism at the lowest  common denominator.”

And that Australia was:

“…prepared to join coalitions of the willing that can bring focus  and purpose to addressing the urgent security and other  challenges that we face.”

As others have said before me, in diplomacy, words are bullets.

And when political bullets are fired by friends, rather than foes, the  political impact is even greater.

The truth is that the international community, in addition to members  of the UN agencies themselves, have been surprised, stunned and  dismayed by the systematic nature of the Australian government’s  relentless assault on the integrity of the UN multilateral system.

The cumulative impact of these statements has been to erode the moral  authority of the UN - a moral authority which is particularly important  in those parts of the world which have historically depended on various

12

forms of UN intervention and where adherence to international norms  are uneven.

Words, however, are one thing. Deeds are another. And this is one  area where the Howard Government’s words have matched its deeds in  their rolling repudiation of the UN system.

At its most simple level, it is reflected at the level of government  representation at critical UN ministerial conferences.

There was no Howard Government ministerial representation at the  June 2000 World Summit on Social Development.

There was no Howard Government ministerial representation at the  2002 Monterrey Conference on Financing and Development.

There was no Howard Government ministerial representation at the  World Conference Against Racism and Racial Discrimination in  Durban.

And most recently, despite the Howard Government’s rhetoric on both  Afghanistan and Iraq, Mr Downer failed to attend the international  ministerial Donor’s Conference on Afghanistan held in Tokyo in  January 2002.

And in October 2003 the Minister again failed to attend the ministerial  Donor’s Conference in Madrid for Iraq - despite the fact that both the  Tokyo and Madrid Conferences attracted ministerial representation  from most mainstream western democracies including the United  States, the United Kingdom, France and Germany.

After a while, your absence is noted.

Ministerial participation in critical UN conferences is one thing.

Ministerial refusal to ratify critical UN conventions is another.

13

In September 2000, the Howard Government refused to sign or ratify  the optional protocol to the convention on the elimination against all  forms of discrimination against women (CEDAW) - causing one of the  co-founders of Menzies’ Liberal Party Dame Beryl Beaurepaire to  remark:

“From this decision it seems to me that Australia is trying to cut  itself off from the United Nations.”

In July 2002, Australia was one of eight countries that voted against the  UN protocol against torture.

But the granddaddy of them all remains the Government’s refusal to  ratify the Kyoto Protocol on Climate Change - despite the fact that the  Russian President’s recent decision to ratify this instrument has left the  Government increasingly internationally isolated in this critical area of  global environmental governance.

While Australia did sign the Millennium Declaration and endorse the  Millennium Development Goals aimed at poverty reduction across the  developing world within definable timetables, the Howard  Government’s statements and policy decisions, including the Foreign  Minister’s annual foreign aid statement, either ignore the Millennium  Development Goals altogether or at best gave them some sort of  superficial single mention.

Beyond non-ratification, there are also problems with non-compliance.

In August 2000, the Howard Government decided to restrict access to  UN Human Rights Committee visits to Australia.

This is despite the fact that similar committees had visited other  developed countries such as Germany, the United Kingdom and the  Netherlands and had delivered negative findings on various acts of  human rights non-compliance in those jurisdictions as well.

14

However, this did not result in any of those governments seeking to  ban Human Rights Committee visits altogether - or to restrict their  access.

The hallmark of a mature, self-confident democracy is complete  transparency.

If democracies start denying or restricting access to Human Rights  Committees visiting, monitoring and reporting within their  jurisdictions, this establishes a less than helpful precedent for states  where democracies are less well developed - or not developed at all.

The Howard Government’s commitment to rolling back UN  multilateralism is also reflected in its determination to withdraw  altogether from certain existing UN agencies. This is demonstrated at  present by the Government’s stated intention to withdraw from the  International Finance for Agricultural Development (IFAD) - a  specialised UN agency in grassroots rural development.

Finally, and most recently, there has been the Howard Government’s  spectacular contempt for the UN process in participating in the invasion  of Iraq - in the absence of the explicit sanctioning of the United Nations  Security Council under Article 42 of the UN Charter.

This single act undoubtedly constitutes the Government’s single  greatest act of contempt for the UN system as a whole.

Invading another state is no small matter. But doing so with cavalier  disregard for international law, for a state like Australia which is not a  Great Power and has so much at stake in the continued integrity of the  international system; such a decision bordered on the reckless.

Quite apart from the other direct implications of that decision in terms  of Australia’s foreign policy and national security interests in the  Middle East and Islamic South East Asia.

Taken collectively, this series of statements and actions taken by the  Howard Government over the last five years have painted a picture of a

15

country seeking increasingly to distance itself - if not remove itself -  from the UN multilateral system.

Unfortunately this has been well recognised in the wider UN family.

As UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary Robinson, said at  the height of the Tampa crisis in 2001:

“It is very worrying that a country with a fine tradition like  Australia would find itself unable to reach out in appropriate  terms and in established practices to people such as these.”

Or in the words of Professor Anne Bayefsky, the head of a major  review of the UN Human Rights Committee system said in the same  year:

“If democratic countries like Australia don’t take a leadership role  in responding to the very few findings of violations against them,  how can they expect other countries with much worse human  rights records to do better? They simply can’t have it both ways.”

Or as former US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright noted last year  in relation to general critics of the UN:

“The United Nations might seem useless to the self-satisfied,  narrow-minded and micro-hearted minority, but to most of the  world’s population, it remains highly relevant indeed.”

Of course, all of this comes at a price.

It may be recalled that back in 2002, the Foreign Minister announced  with great fanfare that Australia would be pushing for a seat on the UN  Security Council for the 2007/08 period. However, come July of that  year, it became apparent that there was insufficient support in New  York and in capitals for an Australian candidature to proceed at all.

Humiliatingly for Australia, the Security Council push was quietly  dropped in the hope that nobody would notice.

16



The last time Australia had a position on the UN Security Council was  when Bob Hawke was Prime Minister and Dick Woolcott was our  Permanent Representative in New York. That was nearly 20-years ago.  What a long way we have come.

The UN at the cross-roads

The Howard Government’s attacks on the United Nations over the past  several years have been part of a broader, global neo-conservative  assault on UN multilateralism.

This attack came to a head within the Iraq war.

So much so that Secretary General Kofi Annan’s statement to the UN  General Assembly last year when he stated that the “consensus”  underpinning the UN system of collective security had been “called into  question” and further:

“we have come to a fork in the road. This may be a moment no  less decisive than 1945 itself, when the United Nations was  founded. At that time, a group of far-sighted leaders, led and  inspired by Franklin Roosevelt was determined to make the  second half of the 20th century different from the first half. They  saw that the human race had only one world to live in, and that  unless it managed its affairs prudently, all human beings may  perish. So they drew up rules to govern international behaviour,  and founded a network of institutions with the United Nations at  its centre, in which the people of the world could work together  for the common good.”

Both in the view of the UN itself and in the view of its neo-conservative  critics, the system is indeed in crisis.

Views differ, however, on how countries, individually and collectively,  should respond to this crisis:

17

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The Howard/neo-conservative paradigm which advocates a  combination of military pre-emption, loose ‘coalitions of the  willing’ which are purpose-specific and which can be deployed  irrespective of multilateral institutions and the rule of  international law.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ From the left, an anti-globalisation movement which argues  blanket opposition to globalisation and global institutions - a lack  of faith in all collective solutions, which is anchored in a  fundamental hostility towards liberal capitalism.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Third, an approach which we would describe as effective  multilateralism which recognises that effective international rules  institutions and patterns of cooperation provide the only secure  means of ensuring security, peace and prosperity - but rules,  institutions and patterns of cooperation that nonetheless require  significant reform.

It will come as no surprise to you that an Australian Labor Government  would favour this third approach - an approach which is grounded in  the enduring advantages of multilateralism which have been argued  earlier in this speech: but an approach which is equally grounded in our  recognition of the complexity of the global challenges which now  confront the international community.

A New Commitment to UN multilateralism - a Five Point  Plan.

First, the Security Council.

Secretary General Kofi Annan has commissioned a high-level panel on  UN reform on ways to strengthen the Security Council’s capacity to  deal with new and complex security threats.

This panel has two principal remits:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Forging a new consensus on the meaning and application of  Article 51 of the Charter which recognises each country’s right to  self-defence if an attack occurs; and

18

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Achieving a new consensus on a common doctrine of  international humanitarian intervention in the aftermath of  Rwanda, Bosnia and Kosovo.

An Australian Labor Government would place high priority on  examining and advancing appropriate proposals from this high-level  panel on UN reform.

Much productive work has already been done by the International  Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty and the specific  criteria it has outlined in order to justify any armed intervention in  states for the purposes of protecting peoples within states. The hard  challenge now is to take these precepts and translate them into norms  within the framework of the UN Charter - and within the framework  of UN practice.

The United Nations cannot sustain another Iraq where the UN Charter  was flouted. But nor can the United Nations sustain another Rwanda  where the UN Charter and its inherent principle of state sovereignty  was used to exonerate the international community from a  responsibility to act.

In this context, the international community cannot remain indifferent  to the present plight in the Sudan. According to the International Crisis  Group, the conflict there has already claimed 30,000 lives and an  estimated 1.2 million people have been forced from their homes.  Experts have warned that without a rapid international response, a  further 350,000 lives could be lost through either starvation or disease.

On 25 May, the UN Security Council expressed “grave concern” about  the deteriorating humanitarian and human rights situation in Darfur and  called on the Sudanese Government to neutralise and disarm the  militias it has been sponsoring. The Security Council welcomed the  Sudanese Government’s announcement that it will facilitate the  international relief effort, but expressed concern about “logistical  impediments” that this operation will now face.

19

The ICG has recommended that the Security Council should authorise  planning for military intervention in Darfur to create a series of  internationally protected concentrations of displaced persons. The ICG  has also recommended that the Security Council consider authorising a  no-fly-zone - and if the government does not disarm its militia the  Security Council should authorise the use of force to achieve this.

To prevent starvation, the ICG also recommends that states launch a  high level diplomatic offensive to urge the Sudanese Government to  allow aid workers full access to affected populations.

Obviously, the Sudan is a long way from Sydney. But so too is Baghdad.  And so too is Kabul.

Australia, as a responsible member of the UN multilateral system,  should be engaged now in active diplomacy in identifying a solution to  the Sudan problem. And beyond diplomacy, Australia now should be  making provision for a large-scale humanitarian assistance effort in the  Sudan, in conjunction with the European partners, in order to avoid a  humanitarian disaster.

The Sudan presents us with a current and confronting example of how  the international community, acting through conscience, should move  through appropriate mechanisms to protect the civilian population of  that country.

The international community cannot remain silent.

This is a challenge to our common humanity.

Second, an Australian Labor Government is committed to  strengthening and extending the current counter-proliferation and  disarmament regime through stronger export controls, more intrusive  inspections, more widely applied and tougher enforcement regimes.  Particular priorities for an Australian Labor Government will include:

20

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The negotiation of a verification protocol to the Biological  Weapons Convention;  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Securing speedy ratification of a Comprehensive Nuclear Test  Ban Treaty; and  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Developing a multilateral machinery to deal with the threat

posed by non-state actors using WMD.

The UN’s disarmament and counter-proliferation regimes are grinding  to a halt.

What is required is a resumption of Australia’s disarmament activism in  international fora, where once again the real threat posed by weapons  of mass destruction around the world (rather than imaginary threats  presented for other political purposes) are properly dealt with.

Third, development assistance.

Australia has endorsed the Millennium Development Goals.

It is worth restating here what precisely the millennium development  goals are:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ To eradicate extreme poverty and hunger;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ To achieve universal primary education;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ To promote gender equality and empower women;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ To reduce child mortality;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ To improve maternal health;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ To combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ To ensure environmental sustainability; and

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ To develop a global partnership for development.



Against each of these objectives, measurable goals within measurable  timelines have been set.

To begin with, an Australian Labor Government will re-engineer the  framework of the Australian overseas aid budget to make it compatible  with the framework of the millennium development goals.

21



Furthermore, an Australian Labor Government will actively work with  the world’s other principal aid donors operating within a common  MDG framework on priority projects in our region.

In a speech last week in Berlin I outlined the desirability of Australia  pursuing common projects with the European Union in our own region  - given Europe’s total aid budget of some US$36 billion annually  represents approximately half of the total OECD aid budget  worldwide.

Australia has a national interest, and we have an international  obligation, to see the realisation over time of the MDG targets within  our own region.

Within our own region, and within the framework of the Millennium  Development Goals, we should be unabashed in our pursuit of the  central objective of the elimination of poverty.

Fourth, international and humanitarian law.

This has been brought into stark relief through recent examples of  prisoner abuse in Iraq - and the failure to apply properly the provisions  of the Geneva Conventions for the protection of prisoners.

The Geneva Conventions were brought into being by the international  community in 1949 to avoid a repeat of the humanitarian disasters of  the Second World War. These disasters not only related to prisoners of  war, but also to civilian prisoners, as seen by the unspeakable horror of  the holocaust.

The Geneva Conventions were also brought about to provide a better  regime for the protection of civilian populations during times of war.  They outline the doctrine of the Occupying Power (a doctrine from  which the Howard Government seeks to cut and run in terms of its  current obligations in Iraq) and the responsibility of Occupying Powers  to provide for the physical protection and sustenance of a civilian  population in times of war.

22



The need for the Geneva Conventions has been rediscovered in recent  weeks - in Iraq, in Afghanistan and in Guantanamo Bay.

In recent years, the Australian Government and many other states in  the international community signed and ratified the Rome Statute  establishing the International Criminal Court. The International  Criminal Court has been vested with particular responsibilities to  prosecute breaches of the Geneva Conventions - in terms of crimes  against humanity and war crimes - if any such breach has not been  properly prosecuted within the jurisdiction of the national of the  offending state.

The current position of the Australian Government is that it is actively  considering granting a so-called section 98 exemption for the  Government of the United States - the effect of which would be that  Americans guilty of grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions residing  in or visiting Australia would be immune from prosecution in Australia.  In August 2002, the Foreign Minister said that he was “sympathetic to  what the Americans say…”

The Australian Government should have ruled this out as a matter of  course when it was first advanced following our ratification of the  Rome Statute in June 2002.

But my challenge to the Australian Government is to rule out now the  possibility of Australia granting an Article 98 exemption to the United  States. For Australia to do so now under current circumstances would  be unacceptable in the extreme.

Fifth, ratifying Kyoto.

As noted above, a Labor Government signed the UN Framework  Convention for Climate Change at the Rio Earth Summit in 1992.

A Labor Government elected later this year will ratify the Kyoto  Protocol.

23

We will then play a constructive role in taking the Kyoto agenda  forward, focusing on the following priorities:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ the development of a global emissions trading regime to help  industry cut emissions at the lowest possible cost;  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ formulation of an ambitious post-2012 agenda to the Kyoto  process, including ways to include developing and emerging

economies; and   Ã¢ÂÂ¢ developing renewable energy sources.

Conclusion

This is by no means an exhaustive plan of action on the part of an  incoming Labor Government in terms of the reform of the multilateral  system.

It represents part of our reform program. But only part.

An incoming Labor Government would also address organisational  reform with the UN itself, consistent with the Secretary-General’s  initiative of September 2002.

We would also review the effectiveness of the Bretton-Woods  machinery - the Bank and the IMF - and also the WTO.

Within the WTO Australia would resume its traditional posture of  international activism - the baton having been dropped by the current  trade minister who has been almost exclusively preoccupied with  bilateral negotiations over the last several years.

We would also aim to reform the International Labor Organisation to  ensure that it resumed its proper place as part of the post-war global  economic architecture - in the proper defence of international labour  standards.

We would examine the global resources, protocols and powers of the  UNHCR - so critical in a world of unprecedented population mobility.

Then there is the complex question of the expansion of the UN Security  Council itself in order to make it a more representative body - with  appropriate additional representation from Europe, Asia, and  elsewhere.

In short, we propose to be a reformist government - both domestically  and internationally.

We do not have the slightest intention of sitting on our hands.

Even less do we have the intention of quietly, and, from time to time  loudly, participating in the incremental destruction of the multilateral  order that has been the policy of the current Government.

Our intention is to participate in the ongoing reform, restructuring and  revitalisation of the multilateral system.

Our intention is to deploy our diplomatic energies through that system  to deliver good outcomes for Australia, the region and the world.

Some may describe this as the reassertion of Labor idealism.

For this we make no apology.

As a political movement we have always believed that we can create a  better world than the one we inherited.

But ours is an idealism equally tempered by the realism that we  confront today in terms of national security and national prosperity on  the home front.

This, however, should never cause us, or constrain us, to construct a  ‘little Australia’ - with a “little vision” for Australia’s place in the  region and the world.

Ours is a much larger canvas.

My central purpose tonight is to signal loud and clear to the Australian  people our political commitment to once again make this country a  positive contributor to constructing an effective multilateral system that

maximises global security, democracy and prosperity.

Within the United Nations system, Australia was once known as a  contributor state.

Now, regrettably, we are known in many quarters as a problem state -  one prepared to tear down, but not prepared to build up.

We intend to restore this country’s reputation as a contributor state.

And in doing so to create an international reputation for Australia of  which we can all be proud.
