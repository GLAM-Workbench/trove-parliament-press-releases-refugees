Topics: Nauru, Agreement with Papua New Guinea, Bounty on people smugglers



MONIQUE WRIGHT:      As we saw in the news earlier with Jess, asylum  seekers have caused $60 million worth of damage  during a huge riot at the Nauru Detention Centre.  Detainees burned down new accommodation blocks,  a medical centre, vehicles and offices and it's  believed to be in response to the Federal  Government's new deal to send asylum seekers to  Papua New Guinea. Under that hard-line policy  people who arrive by boat without a visa will never be  settled in Australia.

ANDREW O’KEEFE :      So here to discuss that decision, amongst other  things, is the Minister for Home Affairs and Justice Jason Clare. Thanks very  much for joining us Jason.

JASON CLARE:             No problem. Thanks guys.

ANDREW O’KEEFE :      First of all quickly, your reaction to the Nauru riot. I  mean these people having arrived before the  establishment of this new rule won't be subject to the

rule but it's obviously a sign of their desperation  around Australia's immigration policy.



JASON CLARE:             A lot of damage and a number of people have been  arrested and they'll go through the legal system in  Nauru now. It's still not clear whether this is the result  of the announcement we've made that people who  come by boat will be transferred and settled in Papua  New Guinea or not. We're still waiting on more  information from our officials in Nauru. But the  bottom line is no-one should doubt our resolve.  We're going to fully implement this policy. If people  come by boat from now on without a visa to Australia  they'll be transferred to Papua New Guinea and  they'll be settled there. It's an important part of  making sure we don't have a repeat of what  happened last week. We had more people drown in  the middle of the ocean.



MONIQUE WRIGHT:      Now we know the voters in marginal seats have  nominated the asylum seeker issue as being very important to them. That's  why you've brought about this policy, isn't it?



JASON CLARE:             I am less interested in the politics and more  interested in stopping people drowning. When I talk  to people in my electorate in Western Sydney, where  you've got a huge number of number that have come  and made Australia their home, a lot of refugees from  Vietnam who came by boat. They're telling me  they're sick of seeing people drowning. Last week I  had to tell the Australian people that we had two  young women in their twenties/early thirties who  drowned on their way to Australia, a young bloke in  his twenties, a young bloke in his thirties. We've had  hundreds of people drown in the last few years.  We've got to remove the incentive for people to get  on a boat and instead go to the UN to seek refuge in  Australia.

ANDREW O’KEEFE :      Yeah. I mean, is this really going to stop them  coming to Australia? I mean if as the Government  claims and it's still not entirely, you know, we're not  entirely convinced of it. You know, PNG is a safe  place for these people to be resettled. Why wouldn't  they come anyway, if it's safer than their countries of

origin, Sri Lanka or Afghanistan or wherever they're  coming from?

JASON CLARE:             The short answer to that Andrew is: not straight  away. People smugglers will still put people onto  boats. They make $1 million a boat, they're going to  lure more people to get on the boats. We've got to  get the message back up the pipeline to people that  are in Indonesia now, or in Afghanistan, or Pakistan  or Iran: don't get on a boat because you'll end up in  Papua New Guinea. If you want to seek refuge in  Australia, the way to do that is through the UN  system. We've increased the number of refugees we  take every year to 20,000 last year, and if this works,  then we're looking at increasing that to 27,000.

MONIQUE WRIGHT:      We'll come back to PNG in a moment, but you've  also announced today a hard-line stance - a bounty if you like - on people  smugglers. Tell us about that.

JASON CLARE:             We've got people smugglers here in Australia - we've  got a lot of them. We've got to shut that market down  and that's why we're putting a bounty on their head.  It's a bounty of up to $200,000 for information that  leads to their arrest, and their conviction. What we've  got at the moment are people smugglers that are part  of an international syndicate. They operate out of  Australia, but also out of Indonesia and other parts of  the world. They help to organise people to get onto  the boat, and they collect their money. They're  trading in human beings here. The agreement with  PNG will help to take the product that they're selling  off the shelf, but we've also got to lock these people  up. And that's what this bounty is designed to do.

ANDREW O'KEEFE:       Those people who are - as we call them - people  smugglers working out of Australia, are subject to  various laws already. So the bounty does smack of  just a massive publicity stunt to relaunch a refugee  policy that is going to be very popular amongst those  who take a very hard line towards refugees.

JASON CLARE:             Andrew we've got a lot of police at work on this at the  moment. Their advice is that there are a lot of people  that are involved in organising boats here in Australia  - often people that've come by boat many years ago -

and that they need information to help to lock these  people up. And by offering a reward, offering a  bounty, we increase the chances of getting these  people off the street. If that saves a life, if that stops  someone getting onto a boat and drowning in the  middle of the ocean, then that's money well spent.

MONIQUE WRIGHT:      What about the appropriateness of Papua New  Guinea as a place to send some of the most  vulnerable people in society. We know that there's  high crime, high unemployment, it's an extremely  expensive place to live, it just doesn't-

ANDREW O'KEEFE:       The Government's own travel advisory warns  against going to Papua New Guinea.

JASON CLARE:             I've been to Papua New Guinea quite a bit. You'd  know that I've taken young people from here in  Sydney to do the Kokoda Track and the Black Cat  Track. I'm there all the time. We've got a problem.  We've got a problem with people smuggling, PNG  have got problems as well. They've got big  challenges with health, with education, and law and  order. That's why we announced last week 50 extra  Australian Federal Police that are going to go and  work in PNG as well, extra money to help them with  health and education - this is what friends do.

We're next door neighbours. They're helping us with  the problem we've got of people drowning at sea, we  need to help the people of Papua New Guinea with  the problems and the challenges that they've got -  health, education, infrastructure, law and order.

MONIQUE WRIGHT:      What about the malaria situation at the moment - we  know that it's not appropriate for children under  seven and for pregnant women to go there. How is  that going to remarkably be changed in future? How  are you proposing to send a pregnant woman with a  small child there, when we know that there isn't a  malaria medication that's safe for them to take?

JASON CLARE:             When we have the appropriate facilities and it's safe  for people to be transferred to PNG, everyone will be,  initially men. Families and young children will be

transferred when we've got the right accommodation  to make sure they can be transferred safely.

MONIQUE WRIGHT:      Alright. Thank you.

ANDREW O'KEEFE:       Sadly we have to leave it there because we're out of  time, but obviously there's a lot more discussion to be had on this issue.

JASON CLARE:              Absolutely.

ANDREW O'KEEFE:       And we'll hear a lot more about it over the coming  weeks. Thank you very much, Jason Clare.

MONIQUE WRIGHT:      Thanks for coming in, thanks Jason.

JASON CLARE:             You're welcome.
