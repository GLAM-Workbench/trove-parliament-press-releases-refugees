PRESS RELEASE ALAN CADMAN M.P.  SHADOW MINISTER FOR  IMMIGRATION & ETHNIC  AFFAIRS

NEW ALP IMMIGRATION FEE

"In Cabramatta, the Labor Party has introduced a new $20 fee  for the sponsorship of relatives. '

"I am shocked that the Government has introduced this fee  which will apply to all relatives of intending migrants Ã¢ÂÂ  ,  if  they wish to meet the Minister for Immigration in  Cabramatta," Mr. Alan Cadman, MP, shadow Minister for

immigration and Ethnic Affairs, said today.

"The Labor Party has announced a function in Cabramatta at  which the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs will  give advice on the sponsorship of relatives provided a fee is  paid to the Australian Labor Party.  This is a gross misuse

of Ministerial office and I can only assume the Minister, Mr  Clyde Holding, MP, is unaware that he will be using his  Ministerial position to raise funds for the Australian Labor  Party.

"Never before has there been such an abuse of the position of  immigration Minister. I am appalled-that the immigration  Programme has been politicised and has ceased to be a  programme based on the merits of a case.

"The implication of this new fee is that the Minister will  bring favours to bear in the consideration of immigration  cases, provided people support the Australian Labor Party.  That is an appalling abuse of ministerial responsibility, the

like of which we can do without in Australian politics."
