SABRA LANE:                     Kevin Rudd welcome to AM.

PM:                                         Good morning. Thanks for having me on the program.

SABRA LANE:                     The front page of the Telegraph has a headline this  morning, across a photo of you it says “Kick This Mob Out”. Are you surprised by  that?

PM:                                         Well Mr Murdoch controls seventy per cent of the print

media in this country, it is plain from what Mr Murdoch  has said through his public statements that he wants to  see the Government removed and he wants to see Mr  Abbott as Prime Minister. We have a free press in this  country so Mr Murdoch’s media is free to say what it will  and of course we disagree with the proposition they put.  In terms of basic fairness and balance of reporting the  Australian people will make up their mind.

SABRA LANE:                     The Editorial goes on to say that you’re tied to old Labor  with its socially divisive and financially ruinous policies.

PM:                                         Well the first thing that I would say is that what

Australians are looking for is a new way for the future,  which is about new politics and not the old politics of the  past. The old politics of the past, in which Mr Abbott is a  key exponent, is one that is grounded in negativity. He is  one of the most negative politicians that the Parliament

has ever thrown up and also one grounded in  divisiveness.

I think what the Australian people want is a new approach  to the future which is based on positive policy and  bringing the country together - government, business,  unions - to deal with the central economic challenge  which lies ahead, which is this: we’ve had a decade long  mining boom which is coming to an end and if we don’t  manage the economic transition which lies ahead of us  then it will affect jobs and living standards. The key  question is who has the right policies to deal with this  change, this management of the transition ahead as  opposed to who simply goes around chanting three word  slogans. This is a complex and difficult task, it affects  every Australian, the economy is key. That I believe will  be central to this election campaign.

SABRA LANE:                     You say that you want to put an end to divisive politics  but you spent a good part of your press conference  yesterday bagging Mr Abbott and certainly Newspoll  shows that if an election had been held on the weekend  that you would be packing your bags in the Lodge this  morning.



PM:                                         Well I said very bluntly yesterday that if an election had

been held on Saturday that Mr Abbott would have been  Prime Minister on Sunday, we go into this election as the  underdogs and there are a number of reasons which  underpin that one of which is a campaign of relentless  negativity by Mr Abbott over three of four years now,  rather than ever putting forward a positive policy. So  when we say for example, “where are your positive  policies Mr Abbott”? There is no answer and some would  interpret that as a negative attack.

When we say “here is our plan to bring the budget  responsibly back to surplus over time without hurting jobs  and without cutting health and education,” Mr Abbott’s  response is that he won’t lay bare how he is going to deal  with this $70 billion dollar black hole, is it going to be a  $70 billion dollar deficit or as we suspect based on the  precedents in Queensland a $70 billion dollar slash and  burn exercise cutting to the bone which will result in job  losses in a difficult time in the global economy as well as  big cuts to health and education.

SABRA LANE:                     Both you and Tony Abbott say that this election is going  to be about trust, why should voters trust Labor given the  Budget forecast deficit for this year has already blown out

from $12 billion dollars to be $30 billion, why should they  trust you on managing the economy?

PM:                                         The first point I note is from today’s media is on the

very question you raise, Mr Abbott has gone out and said  that the Government is deteriorating the fiscal position  and it’s on a scale to match the disasters of Europe, that  is a ball faced untruth. The first point to make about that  is that - and this goes to the question of economic record  - is that our net debt to GDP ratio is scheduled to peak at  13% of GDP, in Europe it is 90% of GDP.

Here in Australia we have avoided recession despite the  Global Financial Crisis, in Europe they have had six  quarters of negative economic growth. Here in Australia  we have unemployment with a five in front of it, in  Europe, in the Euro area they average is 12.1%. Mr  Abbott simply seems to get away with running one  negative line after another and no one calling him out on  that basic fact.

Today, day one of the campaign he has put out a  monstrous lie on this question and he needs to be held to  account. That is why going to your question about the  future and our record, we have managed the economy  through the most difficult of economic circumstances in  decades and secondly we have a plan to deal with the big  economic adjustment which lies ahead through the end of  the China resources boom.

SABRA LANE:                     If you win this election, what mandate will you have?

PM:                                         Well that is a matter for the Australian people as to

who wins the election, secondly the plans we will put to  the Australian people will be clear and concise and we  will honour them. And thirdly, my core proposition to the  Australian people is with this big economic adjustment  coming down the rail tracks toward us, is there a plan to  deal with the necessary diversification of the Australian  economy, the building of new industries, further  investment in the National Broadband Network to boost  productivity for all businesses as well as investments in  manufacturing, investments in agri-business and  continued investments in infrastructure to make sure that  we can negotiate the big transition which lies ahead of  us…

SABRA LANE:                     But Labor has been doing that over the last six years  and it doesn’t seem to have had an impact with the  people, the voters, and also based on your own budget

papers on Friday you’re set to blow the $30 billion dollar  debt ceiling.

PM:                                         Sabra, for the last decade we’ve had a continuing

resources boom which benefited the last four or five  years of the Howard Government and it’s benefited the  early years of this Government as well. What I’m saying  loud and clear is those external economic circumstances  are changing.

The other point I would make is that in terms of the  Government’s economic record I emphasise again,  number one we avoided recession whilst the rest of the  world went crashing into recession. Two, we kept  unemployment low, three we have among the lowest  rates of budget deficit and debt to GDP of any other  major economies of the developed world. These are there  in black and white and Mr Abbott will constantly talk about  a debt and deficit crisis and I simply say again, if it’s so  bad Mr Abbott why have we been given by the three  ratings agencies a triple AAA credit rating. Now with  economic adjustment coming, because we are coming to  the end of the China resources boom, we now have to  chart a new course - so the question for the Australian  people, and for the Government and for the alternative  government, is what is your plan for doing it? Ours is a  new national competitiveness agenda to underpin the  diversification of the economy, growing new industries so  that jobs and living standards are not hurt.

SABRA LANE:                     The Government has announced a further bail out of  the auto sector today, another $200 million dollars, you’re  mandating that the Commonwealth has a 100% target on  buying locally made cars. Why is Labor committing  another $200 million dollars to this sector?



PM:                                         The auto sector in Australia employs, directly or

indirectly, about a quarter of a million Australians…



SABRA LANE:                     Isn’t it an admission that your changes to Fringe  Benefits Tax have harmed the industry?

PM:                                         The auto industry has faced challenges over the last

half decade to decade, when the Government was first  elected we laid out a new car plan for the auto industry’s  future. Auto industries around the world have been under  enormous stress and pressure, particularly in developed  economies. I have said before that I do not believe  manufacturing is an industry just for the past, it is an  industry for the future. Therefore, it means that on a case  by case basis, industry sector by industry sector, the

Government will provide support where necessary and I  contrast that - and anyone who has listened to your  program in Victoria and South Australia where these are  critical questions - Mr Abbott is about to lop off half a  billion dollars of what we thought before was bipartisan  agreed support for the auto sector. I’m a believer in  manufacturing’s future.

SABRA LANE:                     When you lost the Prime Ministership in 2010, you  warned that the Labor party shouldn’t lurch to the right on  asylum policy. But you’ve know effectively outflanked the  Coalition from the right, aren’t voters entitled to think what  do you really stand for?



PM:                                         On the question of asylum seekers, the core point is

this - number one, how do you maintain our national  security and proper border security when through  changing international circumstances the number of  boats coming to our shores is going through the roof?  Number two is this, if you don’t change our policy  direction which we have, then there is a danger of the  entire official migration program simply being  overwhelmed as well as undermining public support for  the post-war migration policies for the country. Number  three is this, at present the Australian Government has  raised the number of refugees coming to Australia  through the official humanitarian program from 12,000 a  year to 20,000 a year.

Mr Abbott has said that he would cut that back to around  twelve, we’ve said that based on the successful  implementation of the policies that we have announced in  recent weeks that we will consider raising the refugee  intake through the official program to 27,000 and here is  the final point, if the numbers continue to rise, the number  of drownings each year is going to go not from hundreds  but into the thousands so the hard question is this - how  do you make sure that people smugglers and their  business model is destroyed? Therefore, you have to go  to the core of it and the core of it is this, to say to them  that if they put people on a boat and send them to  Australia that those people will not be settled in Australia.  It’s a hard message, it’s a necessary message but one  which deals with the humanitarian questions of people  drowning in large numbers, by the thousands as well as  providing room we hope in the future to expand our  humanitarian program further and to take people from  camps around the world, as we’ve done in the past, who  have been languishing, fully processed, often for  decades.

SABRA LANE:                     When you were lobbying for the Labor party leadership  in 2006 did you ever meet with Eddie Obeid?

PM:                                         I don’t believe I have ever met Mr Obeid in my life. It’s

always possible that you end up at the same sort of  function, but I don’t believe I’ve ever met this individual  and if I could add having answered that part of that  question, the report from ICAC is a sober reminder to  everybody about the need to deal effectively with official  corruption. As I said the other day, those who have acted  corruptly should be dealt with the full force of the law, it’s  one of the reasons which I initiated federal intervention in  the New South Wales branch of the Labor party a month  ago, something which has not occurred for thirty or forty  years.

SABRA LANE:                     On campaign debates you want five, the Opposition  wants three. What’s the middle ground?

PM:                                         Well I think the real question is what Mr Abbott himself

has said. Mr Abbott said just after I came to the Prime  Ministership, he said “name me the date, start the  campaign, I’ll debate him every day” unquote, on the  fourth of July. Prior to that, that is prior to the campaign  being officially launched, he has declined four debates so  far. There is one scheduled by Sky News for tonight,  which I have accepted and he has declined.

The key question is can you trust Mr Abbott’s word? He  said in black and white on the fourth of July, just one  month ago, that is what he would do . The campaign is  on, so what I am proposing, I think entirely reasonably, is  that we have four or five networks in this country and that  every Sunday night throughout this election campaign or  at least one night each week during the campaign, each  of the networks should hold a full debate between the  person who is Prime Minister and the person who wants  to be Prime Minister grilled by a panel of you and your  professional colleagues from across the press gallery just  like how it happens with presidential debates in the  United States.

But qhat we have with Mr Abbott is someone who doesn’t  want to answer the hard questions about where will his  $70 billion dollars’ worth of cuts to jobs, health and  education be answered and how can it be answered and  what are this plans to deal with the huge, new economic  adjustment through the end of the China resources boom  which lies ahead. I think if you want to be Prime Minister  of Australia, I really question that if you’re not prepared to  debate the current Prime Minister of Australia in a full and

open way before a panel of journalists who cover the  entire political spectrum, then I don’t really think that  you’re fit to occupy the office of the Prime Minister of  Australia.

SABRA LANE:                     Mr Rudd we are out of time. Thanks for talking to AM  this morning.



PM:                                         Thanks for having me on the program.
