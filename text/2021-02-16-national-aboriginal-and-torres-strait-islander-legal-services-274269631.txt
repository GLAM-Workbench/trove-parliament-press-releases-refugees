Family Court merger opposed by 155 stakeholders, including 13 retired judges

More than 155 stakeholders in Australia’s family law system have now signed an Open Letter to the Attorney-General opposing the Government’s flawed bill to abolish the specialist, stand-alone Family Court.

These  signatories represent  a  range  of  professions  and  community  organisations who  work  with  Australian   families and include 11 retired Family Court and Federal Circuit Court (FCC) judges, in addition to former Chief  Justices the Hon Elizabeth Evatt AC and the Hon Alastair Nicholson AO RFD QC.

The  merger bill would collapse  the  Family  Court  into  the  generalist,  chronically  under-resourced  and  over-burdened  FCC.   The bill was  listed  without  warning  overnight as the  first  item  of  Government  business  on  Tuesday, despite not being included on the Government’s draft legislative program for the Senate this week.

Stakeholders have called for three years for the merger not to be passed out of concern it would have devastating  impacts on families, result in a loss of structural, systemic specialisation and dismantle the appeal division.

The Attorney-General’s Department gave evidence to the Inquiry into family, domestic and sexual violence in  December 2020 that “there hasn't been a specific study of what impact the merger would have with respect to  family and domestic violence issues”, no consultation was undertaken with children’s services, children’s groups  or children’s advocates in relation to the merger, and no working group was formed with the Office of Women.

In  November 2020, eminent  jurist and  former  Chief  Justice,  the  Hon Elizabeth  Evatt  AC,  warned  that  “The  increasing  number  of  cases  in  which  issues  of  family  violence  and  child  abuse  are  raised  has  led  to  an  even   greater need today for family law jurisdiction to be vested exclusively in specialised judges who can give their  full attention to the needs of family law clients without being diverted to exercise other unrelated jurisdictions.  The current bill undermines this principle, is not in the public interest and should not be enacted.”

Law Council President Dr Jacoba Brasch QC said today, “As the impacts of the devastating shadow pandemic of  family violence experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic continue, now is not the time to proceed with an  unnecessary, risky bill that has been opposed by all non-Government members of the House of Representatives.”

CEO of Community Legal Centres Australia, Nassim Arrage, said “the merger would move away from a specialist  family court model, exposing survivors of family violence to unnecessary risk”.

Women’s Legal Services Australia spokesperson, Angela Lynch AM, said “Our opposition to the proposed merger  of the family courts is centred on ensuring the safety and best interests of the child and the safety of adult victim-survivors of family violence in family law proceedings. Safety must come first in family law.”

Stakeholders continue  to  oppose  the bill  out  of  concern  the merger will  increase  cost,  delay  and  stress  for   families.  Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, the Family Court and FCC were facing delays of more than a year’s  worth of cases each.  Two in three FCC judges already have more than 300 matters in their dockets, some more  than 600.  The Chief Judge of the FCC has previously indicated that the ideal number should be around 100 each.   Despite these pressures, the Government increased the FCC’s non-family law jurisdiction in December 2020.

This coalition of stakeholders calls on the Senate to vote against the merger and protect Australian families from  a flawed proposal that lacks any evidential basis and is based on a discredited six-week consultancy report.

Open Letter

Concerns about proposed family court merger

This Open Letter was originally issued in November 2019 by concerned stakeholders, representing a range of  professions and community organisations working with families within the family law system.  In 2021 these  issues remain live concerns as the bill to merge the Family Court into the Federal Circuit Court is still before  the  Senate.   In  December  2020,  the  bill  was  opposed  by  all  non-Government  members  of  the  House  of   Representatives, including all members of the cross-bench.  The Open Letter has continued to be signed by  stakeholders jointly calling for the bill not to be passed, in favour of the below alternatives.  An updated list  of signatories was issued in February 2021.



Originally issued on 11 November 2019

Dear Attorney-General,

We, the undersigned, are writing to you about the Government’s proposal to merge the Family Court of  Australia and the Federal Circuit Court of Australia into a single generalised court: the Federal Circuit and  Family Court of Australia.

Any reform should strengthen a system, not lead to the diminution of specialisation. If the Government’s  proposed reforms proceed, we will lose a stand-alone specialist superior family court.

In acknowledging the need to prioritise the safety of children and adult victims-survivors of family violence  in the family law system, government commissioned inquiry after inquiry has recommended increasing  specialisation in both family law and family violence, including the recent Australian Law Reform  Commission inquiry into the family law system.1  We believe this should be a Government priority.

We understand and support having a single entry point to the family courts and common rules so the  family law system is easier for families to navigate. We understand this is a key reason why the  Government is seeking to reform the family courts.

However, there are different ways this can be achieved. And this can be done without abandoning the  benefits otherwise available to children and families from a properly resourced and specialised court  system.

The Family Court of Australia has said “common rules, forms and complementary case management  systems” … “can be achieved without legislative amendment”.2  The Federal Circuit Court of Australia has

acknowledged the importance of a single point of entry and common case management system “whether  or not the enabling legislative framework is in place”.3

Similarly, there are different models for reforming the family courts other than the model proposed by the  Government.

The New South Wales Bar Association has proposed keeping the stand-alone specialist superior family  court.4 Family Court Judges would be in Division 1 of the Family Court of Australia. Federal Circuit Court  judges who are hearing family law matters would move across to Division 2 of the Family Court of Australia.   In this way, federal judges hearing only family law matters would be in a single specialist family court  offering judicial, social science and other services.

We believe an increase in specialisation in family law and family violence will increase the safety of children  and adult victims-survivors of family violence.  This is particularly the case for groups that are  disproportionately impacted in the family law and family violence systems, including Aboriginal and Torres  Strait Islander people.  The need for increased specialisation of courts to improve decisions and outcomes  for families is supported by the evidence of many inquiries.

We advocate for further discussion of the different options.

We prefer a model that retains a stand-alone specialist superior family court and increases family law and  family violence specialisation, such as the proposal by the New South Wales Bar Association. The safety of  children and adult victims-survivors of family violence requires increased specialisation.  The proposed  merger serves only to undermine that important need.

While we support just, quick and cheap access to justice and there is a role for increasing efficiencies within  our court systems, this must not come at the cost of the safety of children and adult victims-survivors of  family violence.  These two important imperatives are not mutually exclusive, and one ought not be

abandoned at the expense of the other.

Safety must come first in family law.

We would welcome further consultations on alternative models of structural, holistic reform to benefit  children, families and victims-survivors of family violence.

Action can also be taken now to further increase family violence specialisation in the family law system  through:  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Introducing effective ongoing court-based family violence risk assessment practices  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Early determination of family violence, and

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Increasing family violence competency of all professionals in the family law system
