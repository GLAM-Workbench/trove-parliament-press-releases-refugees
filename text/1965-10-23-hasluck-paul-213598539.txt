The Minister for External Affairs, Mr Paul Hasluck,

speaking onÂ·the, occasion of United Nations Day, 2;4th October,

the twentieth anniversary of the entry into force of the

United Nations Charter, said: .  ...

“Â·Â· Ã¢ÂÂ   Ã¢ÂÂ   ' Ã¢ÂÂ   -

"This is an appropriate time to re-affirm the faith

of the Australian Government in the work of the United Nations

and of its related agencies. It is also a suitable .time to

look afresh at some of the contributions to the world which

the United Nations has made during its first twenty years.

In the political field,, it brought about a peaceful settlement t Â·  ' Â·  Â·

. 1  ,  Â·  - Â·  / 1  Â·

.  in Keren during the early 1950’s; it assisted in restoring

.  peace to the troubled Middle East during 1956-7; and more

recently it helped restore stability in the Congo and in

Cyprus, as well as contributing to an Indo-Pakistan ceasefire.

In the social field, it has begun laying a real basis for a

firm acceptance by all nations of the fundamental freedoms and  .  1  .  ‘  !  .  '

rights of man. In the economic field, the recent United

Nations Conference on Trade and Development established new .

machinery to deal with many of the economic problems facing

the international community, especially those of the less- .

developed countries* .

"It should be remembered that 80 per cent of the

United Nations.’  staff and resources are devoted, to its

economic and social work, and considerable progress has been

made in these fields with measures which materially benefit

mankind but are rareljr treated as news. In addition the

social and humanitarian aims of the United Nations are serve-

by the specialised agencies.

"The year 1965 has been given the name Internation

Co-operation Year. Activities associated with the Year

have' been successful in Australia, and helped bring an aware:

to the Australian people of the lesser-known aspects of the

work of the United Nations. International Co-operation Yea:

Convention held in Canberra in May, 1965, was a worthwhile - Ã¢ÂÂ   1 Ã¢ÂÂ   i 'Ã¢ÂÂ Â·Â·

activity; its success rested on the voluntary efforts of

the United Nations Association of Australia and other nonÂ­

governmental organisations, with the full co-operation and

support of the Government.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢"The support of all member states is necessary to

maintain the strength of the Organization. More importantl;

steady and unqualified respect for the principles of interÂ­

national conduct laid dovm. in the Charter and a greater use

the procedures provided by the Charter for settling differen

between nations or for advancing the welfare of peoples woul

do more than anything else to shape a better world, Austra

pledges itself anew to try to serve the purposes and advance

the principles of the United Nations. "
