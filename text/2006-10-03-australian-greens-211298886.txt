Kerry Nettle, Senator for New South Wales



West Papuan's will keep coming as long as human rights  abuses continue in Papua

Senator Nettle, Tuesday 3rd September, 2006

Greens Senator Kerry Nettle today called on the government to call the Indonesians to  end human rights abuses in West Papua rather than turning back genuine refugees  from the troubled province.

"Immigration Minister Amanda Vanstone appears more concerned with pulling up the  draw bridge than recognising that human rights abuses in West Papua are generating  genuine refugees," Senator Nettle said.

"The job of Immigration Minister must be to protect refugees not to comment on  political campaigns overseas. The Minister's attempt to besmirch the motives of West  Papuan refugees represents a serious dereliction of duty.

"The fact remains that every one of the 43 West Papuan refugees who came on the  first boat earlier this year have been found to be genuine refugees. It is irrelevant what  their political views and objectives are.

"If a new boat of asylum seekers comes to Australia then the government should  assess their claims fairly and speedily with no regard whatsoever to the political  situation from which they have fled.

"Senator Vanstone appears to prefer to allow asylum seekers to suffer persecution in  West Papua than to offer them the protection they are entitled to under international  law because this might cause political embarrassment to the Indonesian government."
