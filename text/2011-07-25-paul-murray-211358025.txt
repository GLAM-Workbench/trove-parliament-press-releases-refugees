PAUL MURRAY:

Good afternoon to you, Tony.

TONY ABBOTT:

G’day, Paul.

PAUL MURRAY:

How do you feel about the polls today?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well look, I don’t offer a commentary on them. I think that the field evidence is what counts and when  people see things like that Financial Review story today which suggested that Julia Gillard’s now had three  different positions on climate change - first the real Julia was to support the Coalition’s direct action and  then there was the election policy never ever to have a carbon tax and then there’s a policy now to have a  carbon tax - people think, my God, is there any conviction that this Prime Minister holds?

PAUL MURRAY:

Yeah this is a devastating story, that you should read in the Financial Review today where the Prime  Minister herself was willing to commit to paper her thoughts which is that we shouldn’t have what we now  have, which is the carbon tax and we should have something fairly close to what you’re suggesting. At the  very least she believed that everyone should be on the same page and working together, make it as bipartisan  as possible. But quite obviously the case is that Bob Brown has decided to yank the chain and bang, we’ve  got the carbon tax.

TONY ABBOTT:

Exactly right. Now, you know, we had the real Julia who supports something like the Coalition’s policy.  What the Government’s now embracing is fake Julia and real Bob Brown. But the interesting thing, Paul, is

that apparently the Prime Minister said it was just not true in her press conference today. Well, I hope the  journalists are beating a path to Kevin Rudd’s door to find out what he thinks about this, and if not Kevin  Rudd what about Lindsay Tanner because Kevin Rudd, Lindsay Tanner and Wayne Swan would have been  the other people that got this memo.

PAUL MURRAY:

Now, you would imagine as well there’s a piece of paper somewhere that at least the journalist has seen  before committing to the story. But, when you say we’re seeing the fake Julia, the real Bob Brown, I find  that one of the most staggering things that was in the Nielsen poll last week, that’s in the Newspoll this  week, is that support for the Greens - despite everything that’s happened in the past 12 months - has  actually gone up. At the last election their primary vote was 11.8, basically 12 per cent. This month it’s 13  per cent. Are you equally amazed that their support has grown? It hasn’t even wavered.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, it’s interesting. When you’ve got a major political party, the Labor Party, which appears to be  pandering to a minor party, that’s inevitably bad for the major party and good for the minor party and I think  the Labor Party’s weakness in the face of the Greens’ political imperialism is what’s driving their polling  figures and I think if the Labor Party were to stand up to the Greens it would be a different situation but  unfortunately the Prime Minister has decided that to secure her position in the Lodge she’s got to give  effective power to Bob Brown.

PAUL MURRAY:

What about this Malaysian solution being announced today? Three hundred million dollars, the deal is  exactly what we expected it to be which is the first, or the next 800 people who turn up here, they go to  Malaysia. In exchange, 1,000 people a year for four years. So, it doesn’t even matter if the 800 are filled in  the next six weeks, that deal is still in place, that we are going to get 4,000 people from Malaysia at a cost of  $300 million. My simple point is, I don’t understand why all this stuff can’t be done in Australia because  best case scenario - there’s 800 asylum seekers that become refugees, they go into our community. Worst  case scenario for the Government - they have to send half of them home, they process the other half and  eventually they make their way through. The simple maths, let alone anything else, is the reason why this is  a dumb deal, isn’t it, Tony?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well look, it is a dodgy deal. It might be a good deal for Malaysia but I don’t think it’s a good one for  Australia. I’d make three quick points. First, I think that this is a terrible confession of failure. I mean, the  Government’s been saying for years that it was push factors, not pull factors, and now it admits that, yes, it  is domestic policy that’s been bringing these people to Australia all the time. Second, it’s another broken  promise from the Prime Minister. She was saying up hill and down dale that there was no way that they  would send boat people to a country that hasn’t signed the UN Refugee Convention and now they are, but  another case of the Prime Minister who just can’t be trusted to keep her word. Third point, I just doubt that it  works because we’ve already had 557 boat people and 11 boats since the Malaysian deal was announced.  So, it hasn’t stopped the boats, at least not yet, and I’m not sure that anything that was announced today is  going to make any difference there.

PAUL MURRAY:

But why does Nauru work but Malaysia doesn’t work? Either way, they are people being sent to another  country to be processed, where, as I say, I believe they should be processed here. Why is sending them to  one island country different than another?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, it worked before and, you see, of the people that went to Nauru the majority never came to Australia.  About 30 per cent went back home, about 30 per cent went to a third country and yes, ultimately the rest did  come to Australia but often after quite long delays and it was a disincentive, a serious disincentive, because  it stopped the people smugglers from saying ‘if you get to Australia you’ll get permanent residency’ and the  other thing about Nauru was that while it was a serious disincentive to come at least while the people were  there they were being looked after in accordance with Australian standards, not Malaysian standards. Now, I  have nothing against Malaysia, I think it’s a perfectly good country. But their standards aren’t ours and I  think if the Howard Government had ever proposed to send people to Malaysia the human rights activists  would have been screaming blue murder.

PAUL MURRAY:

Alright, Tony Abbott. He is the Opposition Leader. Nice to talk to you, see you later.

TONY ABBOTT:

Good on you, Paul.

PAUL MURRAY:

See you, Tony.
