ELECTORATE TALK

In the coming week I will be attending a Commonwealth Meeting  in New Delhi, which will bring together Heads of Government  of IS countries from the Asian and Pacific regions.  The meeting  is the second Commonwealth Heads of Government RegionalÂ·Meeting,

the first was held in Sydney in 1978.

The Commonwealth of Nations differs from all other international  associations in that its members share not a common ideology or :  interest, like the non-aligned movement, nor the same geographical

region, like ASEAN or the Organisation of African Unity, but  a similar heritage, derived from institutions associated with  the former British Empire.  This historical link provides the Â·  Commonwealth with many of the features which makes it unique.

Amongst its members are to be found countries in a.ll parts of  the world, at every size and stage of economic, development, with  a variety of political systems and ideological beliefs and a  multiplicity of languages, religions and cultures. The

Commonwealth is a: unique institution... But its special, quality  goes even beyond theÂ· exceptional features I have .identified. It remains a voluntary association which operates only on the  basis of consensus. There are no obligations connected with  membership; no treaty or other written commitments;  only a

dedication to the ideals of the Commonwealth, such as those  enshrined in the. Declaration of Commonwealth Principles, adopted,  by Heads of Government in Singapore in 1971. .

There,  the Commonwealth members expressed the belief that  international peace and order were essential to- the security  of mankind: that the liberty of the individual was sacrosant; , that racial prejudice was a dangerous sickness; that all forms ...  of colonial domination and racial oppression were to be opposed;  that the wide disparities in wealth now Â·  ' existing between different sections.of mankind were too great

to be tolerated; and,  that international co-operation was essential  to remove the causes of war, promote tolerance, combat injustice,  and secure development amongst the peoples of the world.

A source of particular strength in the Commonwealth is its  tradition of holding its discussions confidentially, and reaching  decisions without voting. This enables the members to engage in  full and frank exchanges of view, but at the same time to make  special efforts, to reconcile different points of view in solving  global and regional problems.

It was in this context that the Commonwealth was instrumental  in achieving a breakthrough in the political impasse over  Rhodesia's future, through the Lancaster House talks last year. The independence of Zimbabwe and its admission to the Commonwealth  are a great tribute to the association's role in contemporary  diplomacy. .  .

At a less publicised, but no less important level, are the . Commonwealth's activities in economic and functional co-operation,  which provide worthwhile and practical results to member countries.

-The concept of a Commonwealth Heads of Government Regional Meeting  arose from an Australian perception that the.countries and .  . interests of South East Asia and particularly the Pacific Ocean  regions were not receiving the attention they merited at -regular Heads of Government Meetings because of the Commonwealth's

size and pre-occupation with other world-wide issues.  The Government accordingly decided that, to bring greater .  . Commonwealth focus to bear on the areas of Australia's north west  and east, all Commonwealth countries in the Asian/Pacific. region  would be invited to a meeting in Sydney in February 1978. This  meeting demonstrated that the CHOGRM - as it has come to be

called - concept had responded to a genuinely felt need by the ;   participants, particularly from.the South Pacific, for a  Commonwealth forum of greater relevance and suitability to their  interests,  and the agreement to hold the second meeting in  New Delhi underscored the success of that Australian initiative.

The Sydney meeting was successful not only from the point of view  of the expanded consultative process it has created, but also .   because it instituted a general pattern of both economic and .  . political consultation and understanding which has enabled the ’  .

island leaders of the South Pacific to find roles for their  countries in the international community.

The flow-on from the Sydney CHOGRM. has seen the creation of  a network for exchanges of ideas at the official and political  levels throughout the region which could not have been achieved  without the institution of that meeting. .  .

The New Delhi meeting has the capacity to promote dialogue .   between Heads of Government at a particularly critical time in  international political and economic developments. It will bring  together Heads of Government from a region which borders on the

scene of some of the most serious political issues now confronting  the worldr in Afghanistan and South East Asia. It is also expected  to give major attention to ways and means of increasing  co-operation between member countries, particularly'  in the. areas ,   of energy, and industrial development..  Australia will play its

full part in these efforts. .  .

It has already been announced that Melbourne will be the venue  for the full Heads of Government Meeting late next year. This  will be the most important international meeting ever held in  Australia, bringing together more than 40 Heads of Government.  Arrangements are already in hand for the organisation of this .

meeting and I am confident that it will enjoy the success that has  characterised past meetings and that it willÂ· make a significant  contribution to the consideration of important world issues and  the furthering of Commonwealth co-operation. I would also like to  add that the very fact that that meeting is -being held in Australia

is., in a sense, a compliment to Australia and a compliment to the  role that Australia! ‘has played in a constructive way in Commonwealt  and international affairs.  . . . -----nnn-— . ’ Ã¢ÂÂ
