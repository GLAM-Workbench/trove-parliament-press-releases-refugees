CAMBODIAN SPECIAL ASSISTANCE CATEGORY UP AND RUNNING Ã¢Â‘. "="'  Members of Australia's Cambodian communities have been invited to nominate  relatives In Cambodia who may be eligible for permanent residence In Australia  through the new Special Assistance Category (SAC).

"The relevant regulation for this n&w Special Assistance Category for Cambodians with  close links with Australia, which I announced in October, has been gazetted and Is l.Jp  and running." the Minister for lmmgratlon and Ethnic Affairs, Senator Nick Bolkus, said  today.

"Its success now depends largely on the active involvement of the local community."

To be eligible for permanent residence In Australia through the Cambodian SAC, a  person must have been (esident in Cambodia fot 12 months or more, be experiencing  hardship as a result of recent upheavals In that country and have close links with  Australia.  "Many members of Australia's Cambodian community who are either AustraliC~n  citizens or petmanent residents will have close family members who may be able to  join them In Australia under this program," Senator Bolkus seid.

"A 'neor relative " includes parents, children, siblings, aunts, uncles, nephews or  nieces." ,

As with all SAC programs, a near reratlve or community support group in Australia will  Ã¢Â‘ be requited to give a written undertaking that they can offer successful applicants  support in their first six months In Australia.

This support is to help cover:

food, clothing, accommodation and household goods;

personal support;

access to community and public services;

language int~rpretation and securinQ English language Instruction;

community Involvement and self-reliance .

Succes sful appllcallts will also need to fund thEdr own travel to Australia.

"The Cambodian community and support groups throughout the country heve shown  great commitment and Initiative in helping new arrivals from Csmbodia to build new  lives In Australia," Senator Bolkus said.

"I feel sure that they will be keen to become involv$d in sponsoring and helping to  settle people who move to Australia under the SAC program ...

Senator Bolkus stressed that while many boat people were expected to take up this  offer and return to Cambodia for 12 'months before migrating to Australia, the program  was also available to people who had either returned to Cambodia from asylum  centres In other parts of the region, or who had not left ~ambodla but had relatives  In Australia and were experiencing hardship.

"Thl~ category will assist those who would not be able to meet the normal migration

requirements and who don't fit into the traditional refUt;;~ee and humanitarian  categories," Senator 6olkus said.

"Applicants will need to meet the usual health and character requirements. If they are  succe~sful, they will enter Australia as permant,nt residents and can access the full

range of Commonwealth benefits on arrival."

Under the 1992-93 Humanitarian program, about 6,300 places have been allocated  overall to the SAC. As well as Cambodia, the catecory is currently in place for  minorities from the former USSR; displaced persons from the former Yugoslavia; East  Timorese in Portugal; Sudanese; and Burmese In Burma and Thailand.
