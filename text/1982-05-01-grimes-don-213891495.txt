EMERGENCY AID DEBATE CONTINUES.

Senator Chaney, was: given; opportunities: in Parliament this month  to comment on.the implications of the Victorian Emergency  Relief Re p o r t . I report some of his statements (with asides) -

Chaney:.  ".. any denigration of the.poor would b e  a particularly reprehensible activity and something:  of which ÃÂª. would have no part." (5.5.1982)

2.

Chaney: "Those sole parent families are the result of personal choices by members, of the Australian community. Those, choices are creating real hardship for the  families involved." (5.5.1982)

Does a woman whose husband is killed have any choice about  becoming a widow? Does a parent whose spouse has abandoned the  f a m i l y .have any choice about becoming a supporting parent?  Senator Chaney may not call this denigration, but I believe it

is insulting to a great many single parents in poverty. He further seeks to.transfer the responsibility for hardship  from the Commonwealth back to the unfortunate single parent.

Chaney: "... some 94% of the clients of my Department do not

seek additional assistance. In other words, the  figures disclose that approximately 6 per cent of  recipients of benefits from the Department of Social  Security seek emergency relief..." (5.5.1982)

"I certainly do not accept that for the generality .

of pensioners and beneficiaries there is an inability  to live on the benefits which are provided." (18.5.1982)

".. about 19 out of 20 beneficiaries and pensioners  are living quite adequately on the social securities  which are provided..." (18.5.1982)

It is an extraordinarily complacent view that because only  6% apply for assistance from agencies that the Commonwealth  should not take more responsibility in that field.

Those 6% represent 120,000 people who have generally exhaused  their savings, their families and their friends before forcing  themselves to approach the agencies. .

Senator Chaney is either callous or careless in stating that  19 out of 20 are living 'quite adequately'  on social security  payments. Approximately 1,012,000 pensioners and beneficiaries  have less than $6 a week above their social security cheques -

(550,000 age pensioners; 340,000 unemployment beneficiaries; : 110.000 widow pensioners; 77,000 supporting parents; and 35.000 invalid pensioners). They live below or just above the  poverty line, and it should be remembered that the Henderson  Poverty Report classified those whose income is less than

20% of the poverty line as 'rather p o o r 1.

If only 120,000 people have applied for crisis assistance  it does not mean that the other 900,000 poor or 'rather p o o r '   are living 'quite adequately'. It could be that a great many  are too proud to go to the Salvation Army or St Vincent de Paul,

or are ignorant about other community welfare organisations,  or are simply inured to poverty.

Chaney: "What are the causes of the claimed increase in need...

groups in Victoria... the Social Welfare Policy  Secretariat... Professor Henderson's group... all.,  point to the same thing... that increased unemployment  and an increasing number of single parent families are  very significant factors..."

With that knowledge, Senator Chaney should be able to make a  powerful case in Cabinet for improved payments to the unemployed  and lone parents.

APPEALS INVALID PENSIONS

The number on invalid pensions dropped again in March, the  21st successive month it has done so since the infamous  1  Control of Invalid Pensions' memorandum which endorsed the  Hulme/Griffith guidelines. However, there is evidence that  the more determined applicants are winning their appeals  against the Department of Social Security.

. Between 1.7.1981 and 31.12.1981 there were 2,846 appeals  by invalid pension claimants. Of those, 1,286 were conceded  without getting to the Social Security Appeals Tribunal. That is, almost half were granted when the Department

took a second look. Another 474 cases won their appeals  at the S.S.A.T. In that period 61.2% of invalid pensioners  won their cases.

. In the Administrative Appeals Tribunal 28 invalid pension  appeals have so far been determined, and the appellants have  won 24 of them, with the other 4 to be reviewed after training

and rehabilitation have been tried - an 86% success rate for  invalid pensioners.

There are over 20,000 rejected invalid pensioners who have not  so far appealed. As the Minister for Social Security refuses  to authorise re-examination of these patients on the basis of  changed criteria which include socio-economic factors and  assessments from specialists in different areas, it is

important that medical and welfare officers who see such cases  should encourage those claimants to seek new or additional  medical evidence and return to fight for their entitlements.

TAX AVOISION

Dr Neville Norman of the University of Melbourne in a C.E.D.A.  paper has listed as the main consequences of failing to stop  the growth in tax avoidance and tax evasion -

"1. Some escape from any possible disincentives of the tax  system by some taxpayers, offset to the extent that the  .  :  tax rates faced by others must rise;

2. a demonstrable loss of revenue which appears to be in

the region of $3 billion or more;

;3. to offet this loss of revenue, governments....must

;  impose higher tax rates on non-evading P.A.Y.E. taxpayers and on non-avoiding non-P.A.Y.E. taxpayers  :  than would otherwise be the case. The average tax

rate of about 24% on average weekly earnings would  be well below 20% if avoidance and evasion costing  over $3 million could be eradicated...;

4. tax avoision causes resource misallocation and economic  ;  inefficiency through the diversion of time and brains

to activities that provide escape routes for some  by increasing the tax liabilities faced by the  general community." (1981)

OVERSEAS GREEK EX-PENSIONERS

In the limited reporting of the alleged social security conspiracy  case most media attention has been given to the length and cost  (variously estimated from between $10m. and $20m.) of the commital  hearings against 19 people which have dragged on in Sydney for more  than three years.

The Government has ignored as far as possible the damage it did  to the lives of about 100 families in Greece, when with one phone  call to the Department of Social Security officer in Europe, it  stopped the invalid pensions of all ex-patients of doctors it

had accused of being party to the so-called 1  conspiracy1.

The Department of Social Security was so sure of its righteousness  that it authorised only token medical assessment of the patients  who were in general poor, Greek-speaking, with limited education  and who were supporting families.  For over 100, their cheques

stopped coming from Australia and because they had worked in  Australia and not contributed to a social security system in  Greece, they had no entitlements there. They were penniless  and bewildered.

Almost a year later some received more thorough medical examinations  but they were done under the rigid Hulme (Griffith criteria which took  no account of socio-economic or employment factors or even multiple  factors in determining medical eligibility. There is' little doubt

that if they were today examined in Australia, they would.have  their invalid pensions restored.

Four years later, those distressed families are still writing to the  Prime Minister, to Senator Chaney and to me in an attempt to get some  justice. Senator Guilfoyle, as Minister for Social Security, ignored  their plight for two and a half years, hoping that embarrassing episode  would go away.

I raised the matter of these forgotten people with Senator Chaney last.  October, pointing to the way in which his Government had abandoned them  and also the fact that those few pensioners who had been able to return  by borrowing money had,in a majority of cases, been given back their .

invalid pensions.

I requested action in two areas. Firstly, that a medical officer or  team be despatched immediately to Greece to conduct new examinations  on the same criteria as currently applying in Australia. .  Secondly, that  those people who had been able to get back to Australia and had again  been granted invalid pension should be granted backpayments to March ,

1978 when those pensions had been cancelled because the entitlement  had been proved on the same basis as their original grant.

Senator Chaney assured me in October 1981 that he would take this matter  seriously and gave me the impression that there would be action. In  answer to a question in March 1982, he said he had nothing positive to  advise, and on 20 May 1982> he repeated that. ,

The Minister is continuing the dilatory pattern of other Ministers in the  Government. They began by assuming the patients had received their  pensions by fraud and will neither admit to mistake or move to  see that even at this late stage, they receive natural justice.
