IDENTICAL CRITERIA FOR MIGRANT SELECTION -Australia selects its migrants using criteria applied identically

to all countries, Australia's Minister for Immigration and Ethnic

Affairs,  Mr M.J.R. MacKellar, emphasised on arrival in Manila

today (Friday).

The visit is part of a round of consultations with Governments

in ASEAN capitals. Mr MacKellar has already visited Jakarta and

Singapore.

Mr MacKellar said Australia allowed the entry of people who were

able to make positive contributions to Australia in economic and

social terms. More than 1500 people from the Philippines were now

migrating to Australia each year.

"They include people who have occupational skills, experience or.

personal Qualities that enable them to fit successfully into the

Australian community and to find employment under current conditions",

Mr MacKellar said. Â·

"In the current economic situation in Australia,  we cannot

afford to import unskilled people who will not find employment.  This

applies to applicants from all countries.

"For humanitarian reasons we place emphasis on family reunion

and,  to meet our international obligations, on refugees.

"But, in deciding entry, we take into account the applicant’s

interests as much as Australia’s interests. No one is going to be

better off going to Australia only to be unemployed or to be so

homesick that he or she wants to leave immediately."

Referring to his talks in other ASEAN capitals Mr MacKellar

said:"Refugees are the responsibility of the world, not just of one

region. -

"As a signatory to the United Nations Convention on Refugees,

Australia is doing its utmost to help solve a problem of world dimensions

'  "Certainly, it is not a problem that Australia alone can solve. 4 '  '  .  Ã¢ÂÂ

Our capacity is not unlimited".

Mr MacKellar welcomed the recent statement by the ASEAN foreign

Ministers calling for a more concerted international effort to help

.  resolve the Indo-Chinese refugee problem.

"While Australia is a large country, our capacity to continue

to accept large numbers of refugees must be related to a broad

range of community.concerns. .

"Australia has accepted more than 11,000 refugees already from

the countries of Indo-China.

"A year from now we will have brought in a further 9 >000

Indo-Chinese refugees, bringing the total to about 20,000."

Mr MacKellar said Australia's new immigration policy made

provision for a humanitarian response to refugees.

It also renewed Australia's commitment to an immigration policy

applied universally without discrimination on grounds of race,

'  colour, nationality, descent, national or ethnic origin, religion

or sex.
