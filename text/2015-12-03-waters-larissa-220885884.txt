Larissa Waters Responds to Minister Hunt's Australia's National Climate Resilience and Adaptation  Strategy

Responding to Environment Minister Hunt's announcement of Australia's National Climate Resilience  and Adaptation Strategy, Australian Greens Deputy Leader and Climate spokesperson Senator  Larissa Waters said:

"While adaptation is an important part of dealing with the locked-in impacts of our already changed  climate, it is no excuse for the Government to continue to drive global warming with its dangerous  coal obsession.

"Today's announcement is a pathetic attempt to distract from the fact that the Turnbull  Government's coal obsession is driving sea level rises. It is the equivalent of giving someone a  bandaid for a cut on their left arm while cutting off their right leg.

"It is as if Minister Hunt is living in a parallel universe where he can acknowledge the impact of sea  level rise on Australia's coastal communities, but refuses to accept that rising sea levels will see our  Pacific neighbours inundated.

"It is insulting that Minister Hunt thinks he can get away with saying that he wants to avoid the  creation of climate refugees, while coming to these global climate talks with pathetic pollution  reduction targets and a coal obsession that will condemn our pacific neighbours to inundation.

"Instead of announcing a plan to put a bandaid on a gaping wound, the Environment Minister should  listen to the calls of our closest neighbours stop digging up coal and commit to pollution reduction  targets that will keep global warming below 1.5 degrees," said Senator Waters.
