Manus Island hush money to avoid scrutiny - GetUp

GetUp says the Turnbull government’s move to settle the class action from men it detains on  Manus Island is designed to avoid further public scrutiny of the appalling treatment they have  endured.

“Make no mistake - this is hush money, “ GetUp Human Rights Director Matthew Phillips  said.

“Malcolm Turnbull and Peter Dutton will throw around a seemingly unlimited amount of  taxpayer money to avoid public scrutiny of evidence of abuses occurring within Australia’s  detention regime and to protect the private contractors complicit in those abuses.

“This settlement is an acknowledgement of the abusive environment on Manus Island, an  environment that is unsafe for refugees and people seeking asylum.

“Eight months since the US Deal was announced, still not one refugee has been taken to  safety.

“The Manus Island detention camp has been declared illegal, and will soon be bulldozed, but  the men have nowhere safe to go.

“The camps must be urgently evacuated and the men the Australian government detains  there brought to Australia,” Mr Phillips said.
