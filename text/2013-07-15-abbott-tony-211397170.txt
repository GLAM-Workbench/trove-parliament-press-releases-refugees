TONY ABBOTT:

Ok well look it’s really good to be here at Mater Dei School. I want to thank Tony Fitzgerald, the staff, the Good Samaritan sisters

for making Margie, myself and Russell Matheson the Member for Macarthur and my friend the Member for Macarthur so welcome  here today. This is a lovely school. A really lovely school, doing an awesome job, sometimes with some challenging kids, but

they're doing a great job and helping to give these youngsters the best possible future.

Government can't solve all problems, but we can intervene constructively and strategically to help. That's why I'm very pleased to  say that an incoming Coalition government will help this school with $335,000 towards heating the pool through solar panels that

will save the school an ongoing $30,000 a year in power bills.

You can only make these kinds of investments though if you're prepared to cut down on unnecessary government spending and  that's why we've announced some $15 billion worth of savings over the forward estimates, so we can make the kind of

investments in better schools and better hospitals that the community expects of us. Good economic management is not  something that is done for its own sake. It's done so that we can build a better society with better services. We want a richer

Australia, but in the end we want a better Australia and making investments in a school like this is part of building a better  Australia.

Obviously we are moving closer and closer to an election and the election will present the Australian people with the clearest

possible choice. On the one hand, a Coalition that will abolish the carbon tax, on the other a Government that believes in a carbon  tax - might want to change the name, but they still believe in the carbon tax. On the one hand, a Coalition with a proven track

record for getting the Budget back into the black and paying down Labor's debt. On the other hand, a Labor Party which is  addicted to debt and deficits.

Most significantly, a Coalition with a proven record of stopping the boats, versus Labor under Mr Rudd which started the boats

and can't stop them. Not only is Mr Rudd the best friend the people smugglers have ever had, he's basically acted as their travel  agent. He created the route and people are just on it every day now. More than 2,000 illegal arrivals by boat, just in the fortnight or

so since Mr Rudd became Prime Minister again. So it's the clearest possible choice. Over the last three years, the Coalition has  offered people the same strong team, the same clear plans, but we've had nothing but division and dysfunction. A chaotic circus

from the Labor Party and the last thing the Australian people would want is to have three more years like the six years we've just  endured.

So as I said, it's a very clear choice. I’m very proud to be here with Margie and with Russell. I’m going to ask Russell to just say a

few words about this school. It's a school and a cause which is dear to his heart. It's dear to the hearts of so many people in the  Macarthur area here around Camden and Campbelltown and I'm pleased to be able to support Russell today in this very

important cause.

RUSSELL MATHESON:

Thanks very much Tony. It’s great to see yourself and Margie back in Macarthur. You are friends of Macarthur and the people of  Macarthur really do appreciate you being here today. It’s a wonderful announcement for a school that’s very close to my heart -

Mater Dei Special School. The cost savings are going to be reinvested into early intervention programmes within the school. So  savings on energy go back into other programmes which is great and I really appreciate that. I know that Principal Tony Fitzgerald

would appreciate it. The teachers, the students and the parents, so it's a wonderful announcement and the people of Macarthur  and the people of Mater Dei really do appreciate it. Tony we thank you very much. And one thing I’d like to say is that I'm the only

person who's a candidate in the Macarthur election for the federal election who has promised to abolish the carbon tax.

TONY ABBOTT:

Thanks so much. Ok, do we have any questions?

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, can you promise under a Coalition government that no school would be better off if you wound back Gonski funding?

TONY ABBOTT:

I can promise that no school would be worse off under the Coalition. We will continue the existing system for one or two years, we  won't be holding a gun at the head of the states. We certainly don't believe that an adult government just makes a unilateral

announcement then says to people, sign up or else. So, we can guarantee that no school will be worse off under us because we  will continue the existing system until such time as we are confident that any replacement is an actual improvement and is

affordable.

QUESTION:

Will you be offering any new funding of your own under the Coalition?

TONY ABBOTT:

We will have more to say about school funding between now and the election but let's never forget that to do Gonski on the basis  that no school is worse off will cost $6.5 billion more every single year and we simply don't have that amount of money. So, the

problem with Gonski as things stand under this government is that they are holding out the mirage of more money but can never  actually be specific about how much more any particular school is going to get in the immediate future and that's no way to run a

system. It's no way to allow schools to plan.

QUESTION:

What if Queensland were to sign up though? Isn't that the majority that you said Gonski would need to go ahead?

TONY ABBOTT:

We always said it had to be an overwhelming majority. The fact is that Queensland has put down some quite onerous conditions.

Essentially, the university funding cuts have got to be reversed. There's got to be something like $600 million a year more on Day  1 and there's got to be dramatic changes to the Gonski legislation to ensure that the State Government can continue to be

sovereign over its own schools. There's no way that the government can meet those conditions.

QUESTION:

What would the Coalition do if the government tried to bring back Parliament to legislate a change from a fixed carbon price to an  emissions trading scheme?

TONY ABBOTT:

The point I want to make about this is that it's just another Kevin con job. He is proposing to change the name but not to actually

abolish the tax. Whether it's a fixed price or a floating price, it still hurts and it is still going to go up and up and up. Let’s never  forget that under the government's own modelling the carbon tax, the floating carbon tax, was going to float up from $25 a tonne

in 2015 to $38 a tonne in 2020 and to an almost unbelievable $350 a tonne in the decades ahead. So, the important thing to  remember is that this is a name change only. It's not a real change. This is more fake change from Kevin Rudd. It's not real

change. The one thing he has done is he's admitted that what the Coalition has been saying about the carbon tax was right all  along. On Saturday the government was insisting that the carbon tax was good for you. On Sunday it finally admitted that the

carbon tax was bad for you. Now, if reducing the carbon tax on a temporary basis is good, abolishing it forever is even better.  That's what the Coalition will do.

QUESTION:

If this emissions trading scheme does ease cost of living burdens that you have repeatedly raised would you support it?

TONY ABBOTT:

The fact of the matter is we will abolish the carbon tax. Kevin Rudd won’t abolish the carbon tax. All he's doing is bringing forward

by 12 months what Julia Gillard was doing anyway. This is fake change. It's not real change. It's typical of Kevin Rudd. It's another  Kevin Rudd con job. By all means, bring the Parliament back and let's vote to abolish the thing altogether.

QUESTION:

Isn't having a market-based system, though, quite within the philosophy of the Coalition? Indeed, Howard and the thesis by Greg

Hunt in the past? Isn't that kind what have needs to happen?

TONY ABBOTT:

This is not a true market. Just ask yourself what an emissions trading scheme is all about. It's a market, a so-called market, in the

non-delivery of an invisible substance to no-one.

QUESTION:

12/11/2013 http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/22487/20130903-0148/www.tonyabbott.c...

Isn’t that like financial markets?

TONY ABBOTT:

I mean let's think about it. It is a market in the non-delivery of an invisible substance to no-one and look, ever since Copenhagen,  it's been absolutely obvious that the world is not moving towards taxes, whether they're fixed taxes or floating taxes. The world is

moving towards the kind of direct action measures to improve the environment which the Coalition has long championed.

QUESTION:

What do you make of the Immigration Minister joining Kevin Rudd for talks in Papua New Guinea and what do you think will  actually come out of those talks?

TONY ABBOTT:

All that ever comes out of anything involving Kevin Rudd is more talk. More talk, no real action. This person, this Prime Minister is

the Prime Minister who started the boats. The guy who started the boats can't stop the boats. Not only is he the best friend the  people smugglers have ever had, but he’s now acting as the travel agent for the people smugglers and unfortunately the only way

to stop the boats is to change the government and put back in place the policies that have been proven to work.

QUESTION:

So will you be talking then with your Indonesian and Papua New Guinean counterparts if you were to become Prime Minister?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look of course and, you know, if Mr Rudd hadn't done such enormous damage to our relations with Indonesia and other countries  in the region the problem may have been more manageable. But unfortunately not only did he close down Nauru and close down

Manus, not only did he abolish temporary protection visas, not only did he fail to turn boats around despite having promised to do  so but he completely mishandled relations with our neighbour, our giant neighbour, over boat people by continually practicing

megaphone diplomacy over, amongst other things, the Oceanic Viking incident.

QUESTION:

Why do you think the polls have changed to show Labor 50-50 with the Coalition?

TONY ABBOTT:

I’ll leave others to offer their own analyses, but look, the Australian people are relieved to see the back of an unpopular Prime

Minister. The Australian people are always prepared to give others a fair go. That's in our nature. But what the Australian people  really want is someone who's fair dinkum and the fact is, from the Coalition over the last three years, you've had the same strong

team and the same clear plans. You've had no consistency whatsoever from Mr Rudd and I think one of the points that is starting  to sink through to the Australian people is that if Julia Gillard couldn't trust him, how can the Australian people trust him?

QUESTION:

There has been a resurgence in the polls. Are you going to change your approach?

TONY ABBOTT:

The job of opposition is the same every day. We've got to hold the government to account and we've got to be a strong alternative

and that's exactly what I've been doing every day since the last election. Same strong team, same clear plans.

QUESTION:

Are you not worried your message is not getting through anymore? It seemed to work against Julia Gillard. Is it working against  the current Prime Minister?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, I'm confident that the Australian people aren't mugs. The Australian people aren't going to fall for the same trick twice. The  Australian people gave Mr Rudd a fair go and he did so badly that he was sacked by his own party. He was humiliatingly sacked

by his own party and let’s not forget that just a fortnight ago, fully one third of the Cabinet refused to serve with them. Now, all of  you know how reluctant ambitious politicians are to surrender their political careers. Well, one third of the Cabinet would rather

resign than serve with Mr Rudd. That says something about the kind of person Mr Rudd has been. I say to the Australian people,  if those who knew him best don't want to serve with him, why would you trust him with another three years? Surely we’ve had

enough of the circus. It’s time to move on.

QUESTION:

Are you going to join Mr Rudd on a barn storming Queensland tour like he that's doing on his return from PNG?

TONY ABBOTT:

12/11/2013 http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/22487/20130903-0148/www.tonyabbott.c...

I've been travelling the country, I’ve been listening to the people of Australia for three years now. I haven't been holed up in an  office in Canberra, I haven’t been wandering the world spreading my wisdom. I've been talking to the Australian people for three

years now learning from them and the interesting thing about Mr Rudd is he had a plan to tear down a prime minister but he  doesn’t have a plan to make our country great.

That’s what the Coalition has. That’s why it’s so important to abolish the carbon tax, so that people’s cost of living pressures will

be improved. It’s so important to abolish the mining tax so we’ll have the investment and the jobs we need. Build the 21st Century  infrastructure that cities like Sydney and Melbourne and Brisbane and people living along the Pacific Highway and the Bruce

Highway need. Get the Budget back into the black so we won’t be mortgaging our children’s future. We know what we want to do.  All Mr Rudd wanted to do was to get rid of a prime minister.

QUESTION:

Housing affordability’s one of the top concerns of voters. What’s the Coalition’s plan to fix the problem?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well I’m pleased you’ve asked about that because while there is much at a state and local level which is necessary to improve

housing affordability, abolishing the carbon tax on its own will take about $5,000 off the price of building a new home because  almost everything that goes into a home - the glass, the steel, the bricks, the concrete, involves massive amounts of energy in its

manufacture. So abolishing the carbon tax will take $5,000 off the price of the average new home. Then of course, if we can  improve the infrastructure, if we can work with the states, if we can ensure that bodies such as the Australian Building and

Construction Commission are fully re-established - let’s not forget the Australian Building and Construction Commission was able  to improve productivity by almost $6 billion a year in the construction industry. So we have a plan that will actually reduce cost

pressures in the housing industry. All Mr Rudd has is more talk and more meetings.

Thank you.
