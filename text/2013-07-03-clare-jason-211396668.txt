FRAN KELLY:        The arrest earlier this year of four customs officials  suspected of drug trafficking at Sydney Airport  prompted a widespread overhaul of the Customs and  Border Protection Service. The Home Affairs Minister,  Jason Clare, will release the first report of the Customs  Reform Board today which he set up in response to  growing concerns that criminal networks were trying to  infiltrate Customs with some success. And the board will  recommend a range of measures designed to change  the culture and the practice within Customs including a  proposed introduction of fixed tenures to try and  mitigate the risk of corruption.



Jason Clare joins us now. Minister, welcome back to  Breakfast.

JASON CLARE:     Good morning, Fran.

FRAN KELLY:        You say that Customs needs major structural and  cultural reform. That suggests a breakdown of its  operational capabilities. How bad are things at  Customs?



JASON CLARE:     Customs and the Customs team are doing a good job.  What this report shows is the current model is not going  to be good enough in the future. You'll remember last  year, Fran, we talked about the first stage of these

reforms. I implemented integrity testing and drug and  alcohol testing last year. The rolls out the next stage of  reforms but the challenge for Customs is bigger than  just the corruption issue. What this report shows is that  over the next five years, the amount of cargo and the  number of passengers coming to and from Australia is  going to increase dramatically and that is going to  require big changes to the structure, the training, the  equipment that Customs officers use. But also big  changes to the culture. Culture is often the hardest thing  to change but the most important.

FRAN KELLY:        And how bad is the culture though? I mean how much -  we've had these arrests - 20 people arrested so far as  part of Operation MARCA.

Which I guess is a relatively small proportion in a 5000  strong workforce. How much evidence that organised  crime has infiltrated the service?

JASON CLARE:     We’ve seen evidence of that from the arrests. We're  seeing evidence of officers who have been susceptible  to corruption, who've stood over managers, manipulated  rosters in order to get drugs or precursors into the  country. When you get evidence of that, that's serious  enough to act. That's why last year I established the  Customs Reform Board headed up by Justice James  Wood who ran the New South Wales Royal  Commission into the New South Wales Police Service.

He's provided me with a great set of recommendations  and advice to make sure that we can weed this out and  stop it coming back.

FRAN KELLY:        One of the recommendations for weeding is out is a  recommendation for fixed tenure periods for Customs  staff to mitigate the risk. What does that do? What kind  of problems arise when someone's stayed in a job for a  long, long time?



JASON CLARE:     I'm glad you asked that because this was one of the  problems identified in the New South Wales Police  Service, particularly at Kings Cross where people were

in the same job for too long. They could build up  relations that could enable them to act in a corrupt way.  We've seen evidence of that here as well where people  have avoided promotion in order to stay in the one job,  get on the right roster, in order to import drugs into the  country. So one of the things that Justice Wood  recommended to me is that you need to limit tenure in  certain jobs to certain time periods.

Now that will vary depending on the type of job that  people do but it is a really important anti-corruption  measure.

FRAN KELLY:        There's also a recommendation for a special integrity  adviser. What would that do?

JASON CLARE:     We already have an independent integrity  commissioner, a corruption watchdog, a little bit like the  ICAC or the PIC who runs these investigations and  Philip Moss, the Integrity Commissioner, ran this  investigation at Sydney Airport. This position will sit over  the top of the internal investigation team, the  Professional Standards branch. And it'll report direct to  the chief executive officer and run some of those  complicated investigations with Philip Moss, the  independent integrity commissioner.



FRAN KELLY:        There's also a recommendation to tighten up on the  policy about secondary employment which I guess  means a ban on Customs officials holding down a  second job. Why is that an issue?



JASON CLARE:     This was another recommendation put to me by Justice  Wood. He said there are some jobs that people do  where it can expose them to criminal elements. Whether  it might be doing work after-hours in the security  industry or other areas of employment. That can expose  people to criminal elements and increase the risk of  people getting involved in corrupt behaviour. So he said  look, you need to have a good look at secondary  employment policy and tighten that up.

So that work will now occur on the basis that we need to  tighten the rules when it comes to second jobs.

FRAN KELLY:        Customs and Border Protection is also on the frontline  when it comes to intercepting asylum boats. So it's a  massive job. I mean just in air cargo movements back to  the general Customs work, 95 million air cargo  movements by 2017 is the suggestion. But on the boats  front, more than 740 boats carrying asylum seekers  since 2007. That must be putting a huge strain on  Customs too, is it?



JASON CLARE:     It does. They do an enormous amount of work, working  hard. They wouldn't have to work as hard if the  politicians would work together on this to form a political  solution. It's politics that have been poisoned here that  make this such a wretchedly difficult problem. We've got  a good structure in place in Customs with what we call  Border Protection Command, which is over 100 officers  in the headquarters in Canberra made up of Defence  officers as well as Customs officers, and we're going to  replicate that model here with the reforms that are being  implemented as part of this blueprint to create a  Strategic Border Command to make better use of the  skills that we've got to target crime at the airports and  ports.



But you're right, Fran. The team that work on our  borders, particularly intercepting boats, work very, very  hard and they wouldn't have to work as hard if the  Opposition had worked with the Government on this  issue.

FRAN KELLY:        There has been a big increase in the number of Iranian  arrivals. Of the nearly 13,000 people who've arrived on  boats in the past six months, almost - more than 4000  are from Iran. Bob Carr says most of them are  economic migrants. Gillian Triggs, the Human Rights  Commissioner, says how we do know, we haven't  processing people. Do you agree that most of these are  economic migrants and how do we know that?



JASON CLARE:     Well, I've said this before. It hasn't received as much  publicity as what Bob has said, but I've made the point  before that there are a large number of people who are  coming to Australia and are seeking a better life looking  for a job, and that…



FRAN KELLY:        But how do we know that if we haven't processed  them?

JASON CLARE:     Well, the people that have come recently from Sri  Lanka, an awful lot of them have said, look, I'm here  looking for a job…



FRAN KELLY:        Sure, but a lot of them have been sent straight back.

JASON CLARE:     That's right, and that's the point, that over 1000 people  from Sri Lanka have been flown home because they  don't meet the requirements for asylum.



FRAN KELLY:        But that doesn't tell us anything about the Iranians.

JASON CLARE:     No, let me get to that. A lot of Iranians are also coming  to Australia because of the sanctions that are  happening in Iran and seeking a job, seeking a better  life. The real problem here, Fran, is that we can't fly  them home because Iran, unlike Sri Lanka, refuses to  take their citizens back unless they voluntarily want to  return home. So unlike Sri Lanka, where you can fly  them home, you can't fly them back to Iran.



FRAN KELLY:        Yes, but you're prejudging the tribunal. You're basically  saying the tribunal's getting it wrong, and even though  we haven't been processing people for six months. On  what is this based?



JASON CLARE:     I'm placing the caveat it's not my portfolio area, but I  make this point, and it's been in the paper and I think  others have mentioned it, there is an approval rate at  the moment of around about 90 per cent of people  seeking asylum and that is much, much higher than any  other equivalent countries in the world. In those sorts of  circumstances, I think it's appropriate for us to review  the current process. That's what Bob's talking about,

that's what the Government's talking about, and I think  that's the right thing to do.

FRAN KELLY:        And just finally, you were a long-time supporter of the  former Prime Minister Julia Gillard. I understand you  voted for Kevin Rudd this time around. After - I  remember speaking to journalist Kerry-Anne Walsh.  She spent three years documenting, really, day by day  what she paints a picture of a campaign of disloyalty  from Kevin Rudd and others white-handing Julia  Gillard's leadership. Do you accept that view of what  happened to Julia Gillard?



JASON CLARE:     Fran, I joined the Labor Party a long time ago, and I  joined the Labor Party to help it make a better country.  I'm not going to tease through the entrails. It doesn't  help the party that I love so much. What I'd say is this: I  think and I hope that the days of division are over.  People have been disappointed with us, they don't want  to vote for Tony Abbott. There's a lot of people out there  that are very worried about an Abbott Government, and  the decision that was made last week, and I spoke to  Julia personally about it, makes us more competitive  and gives us a real chance at the next election.



FRAN KELLY:        Jason Clare, thank you very much for joining us.

JASON CLARE:     Thanks Fran.

FRAN KELLY:        Jason Clare is the Minister for Justice and Home  Affairs, releasing that report into the operations of  Customs with recommendations today.
