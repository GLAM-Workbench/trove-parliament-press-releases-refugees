PRIM E M IN IS TE R

TRANSCRIPT OF NEWS CONFERENCE, PARLIAMENT HOUSE, SYDNEY, 5 APRIL 19^1 .

E & ÃÂ E - PROOF ONLY

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, your response to the States all ganging up on the wheat issue.

PM: I had a very congenial meeting with them at morning tea  and there was no pressure upon me. They expressed their  understandable interest in the problems of the rural regions  of their States and I indicated that John Kerin would be  coming to Cabinet in the near future with submissions

relevant to this issue and we would be hoping to make a  statement as soon as we possibly could which will be of  assistance and relevance to the sections of rural Australia  which are undoubtedly experiencing a very severe crisis.

JOURNALIST: Mr Bannon wants the statement delivered by next  week. Is that possible?

PM: Well look John and I and the other Premiers had our discussions and it was a very amicable one as to the timing  of what we'd do.

JOURNALIST: He seems to think that Cabinet doesn't realise  the severity of the situation for wheat farmers.

PM: ... to me.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, if we could just go to the Constitutional -PM: Oh, this politeness between journalists is ... to

Sydney is it?

JOURNALIST:  Prime Minister, the Western Australian Premier

PM: Oh, you snuck in. Now come on.

JOURNALIST: Do you think Western Australia will in fact go it alone with underwriting wheat? ,

PM: Well I don't know. You'd have to- ask the Premier of Western Australia that.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, turning if we can just to the Constitutional Conference that has been takino olace.  vou

indicated last night that you wouldn't propose a referendum -   on a four year term unless you gained bipartisan support.

PM: That's right.

JOURNALIST: The Conference seems to have endorsed that. Do  you expect that bipartisan support?

PM: I'll be talking to Dr Hewson.  Let me say this; I don't think he's'endeared himself to many people around the place  by the way he's played politics with this issue. I mean I'm  accustomed when I write a letter to the Leader of the  Opposition on an important matter for it to be treated  confidentially between us. He went public on this issue for  pretty miserable political purposes but I hope that that's

something he's got out of his system now and that he'll have  a sensible private discussion with me. I expect that that's  what he'll do. I certainly hope so. I ’m prepared and  desperately want to have a constructive conversation with  him and that to getting agreement between us on the issue of

four year terms. The principle is clearly agreed but there  are certain matters of detail which particularly concern the  Senate. Now I think with goodwill we can sort this out. But he hasn't shown much evidence of that goodwill by the

silly politics he's been displaying. But as I say. I hope  that's out of his system now and he can get on with  business.

JOURNALIST: The Premier of Western Australia, Carmen Lawrence, has in fact indicated that she wants to continue  with some sort of support for wheat farmers even if it means  some sort of constitutional challenge. What's your

response? —

PM: Well this is a matter for the Western Australian  Government to make up its mind on. We've made it quite  clear that we will not be supporting a minimum guaranteed  price scheme.  It's not something that recommends itself to

the majority of the Premiers. So if they see that we are  going to be making decisions which will be of assistance to  farmers without there being in that package a minimum price  scheme she may not want to go ahead. But that's really  going to be a matter for them to determine.  I've got enough  responsibility making the decisions in my area of Government  without being riding shot gun on all the States.

JOURNALIST: What's your reaction to Telecom's suggestion of increases of up to 11% in phone charges?

PM: Well there are these things to be made.  You know we've  laid down a system whereby it could not be making increases  at will. It had to come within the CPI minus X factor. The  proposals clearly come within that. -There haven't been  increases for 2% years.  Now the process that's followed is  that they put their submission to Austel, which is the -

independent authority, to examine whether the proposed  increases are at less the inflation rate and sionificantlv  less the inflation rate and if they so find then we don't

3 .

have any discretion in this matter. That's something that  will be followed through.  We'll see what Austel has to say.

JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, are the Kurds entitled to feel they've been let down by the allies? Is there anything  anyone can do?

PM: I think the Kurds are entitled to feel they've been let down not just by the allies, I think if you look at their  history they've been let down by just about everyone.  They  are a tragic people in terms of the injustices that have  been inflicted upon them. Senator Evans will be meeting  next week with representatives of the Kurdish community in  this country. We'll be looking at what there is that we may  be able to do to stimulate interest in other countries to  deal with this tragedy.  As you know we've already allocated

some $2M to the refugee problems caused by this recent  conflict. I hope that we can help to mobilise world opinion  on this issue because it is truly a tragedy for which  countries in the region over many, many years now have to

accept a very great responsibility and now that there has  been the period of the war and the involvement of the  multinational force, I think there is a broader area of  responsibility and we'll certainly be prepared to be part of

an international effort to try and bring some sort of  economic justice to these people.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, returning to another issue on the constitution, a number of speakers there including  Justice Pincus, have suggested that 2001 would be an ideal  date for Australia to become a republic. That issue itself  doesn't really come up in the final statement. Would you

like to have seen it there and do you think it would be """a  realistic timetable?

PM: Well you know my position on the question of a republic. It is inevitable Australia will become a  republic. It is a question of when. I think it is  something in which political parties have to get a sense of

the feeling of the community.  It still would be something  which for a lot of people would be hurtful but for an  increasing number of the Australian population I think there  is probably a feeling that Australia should in all its  constitutional and legal apparatus be seen to be and in fact  be totally independent. Now having said that I make two  other points.  I think in fairness to Her Majesty that I

should say that she has been an ideal sort of head of this  nation in the strictly prescribed sense in which she does  it. She doesn't seek to intervene in the affairs of this  country. She has a great knowledge of this country.  So

therefore when I say that it's inevitable that this country  will become a republic it involves no reflection upon the  role that Her Majesty has played- in her constitutional role.  The second thing is I think we shouldn't get this question  of a republic in the wrong sort of proportions. I think it

is something that will and should come to make Australians  absolutelv understand that we are a comoletelv sovereian  independent nation. But we shouldn't believe that it's

4 . ÃÂ /

' going to make any difference to the daily life of Australian-

citizens. I mean it doesn't effect the daily welfare of  them. It's something which will probably give them a  greater sense of an independent nationhood, well that's OK.  It'll come in due time. What's the right year? I don't  know. I just simply repeat what I've said before. In terms  of my concerns for the well being and interests of the  Australian people, there are many issues that I've got high  on my priority list than that one. -

JOURNALIST:- inaudible

PM: I ’ll tell you what I've got on my priority list now is to go and join Sir Ninian Stephen for lunch. Last one  question.

PM: Prime Minister, job vacancies figures out today, the seasonally adjusted figures for February - the lowest since  November 1983. Have we reached the bottom of the trough  now?

PM: I think we're round about there, Dennis. There's quite a bit of statistical and anecdotal evidence that our  expectation that we will be beginning to come out of the  recession during the second half of the year that it is  valid. But as we've said all along, both Paul and myself,  we've said that the labour market as you come out of a

recession that's the last area which you get the signs of  recovery.  So I think the figures that you refer to are  consistent with that proposition.
