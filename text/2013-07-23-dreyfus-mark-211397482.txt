TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH LYNDAL CURTIS - ABC NEWS 24, CAPITAL HILL

SUBJECT: Regional resettlement arrangement with Papua New Guinea; new ASIO building

E & O E - PROOF ONLY



CURTIS:                                 The Government is confident its agreement

with Papua New Guinea will stick. It's rejecting  Coalition claims the deal isn't specific enough,  and will allow asylum seekers whose refugee  claims have been rejected to come back to  Australia. To discuss the deal I was joined by  the Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus.

[Plays excerpt]

CURTIS:                                 Mark Dreyfus, welcome to Capital Hill. You

have said you won't release the legal advice on  the deal with Papua New Guinea, what gives  you confidence though, that it doesn't breach  either Australian laws or the commitments  Australia gave under the Refugee Convention?

DREYFUS:                              I'm confident because of the careful

consideration we've given to this arrangement  with Papua New Guinea. And as I've also said,  we've got the assistance of recent decisions of  the High Court of Australia in this very area  concerning the Migration Act, and of course  that provides us with guidance on where we  can go with arrangements with other  countries.

CURTIS:                                 So the ruler, the bar set by the High Court's

decision on Malaysia, was run over this one?

DREYFUS:                              Well, it's in the same area obviously, and one

of the big differences you could point to is that  Papua New Guinea is of course a signatory to  the Refugees Convention. And Papua New  Guinea has made it clear that it will be  withdrawing the reservations that it had to  certain aspects of the Refugee Convention in  respect of people transferred from Australia,  and that of course, means that all people  transferred from Australia will have the full  rights available under the Refugees

Convention.

CURTIS:                                 So that basically deals with the concerns that

the High Court raised about the agreement  with Malaysia?

DREYFUS:                              I'm pointing to a very key difference between-

that the High Court concentrated on in the  Malaysia decision about the fact that Malaysia  is not a signatory to the Refugees Convention.

CURTIS:                                 The Opposition has raised a question about

whether the agreement with Papua New  Guinea is legally binding - is it, and does it have  to be?

DREYFUS:                              The Opposition really doesn't know what

they're talking about. What we've seen,  disgracefully, from the Opposition for the last  couple of days - having initially said they would  support this arrangement with Papua New  Guinea - is a deliberate undermining, a  deliberate undermining of this arrangement,  and they really should be ashamed of  themselves. It's not in our national interest  that you have any members of the Federal  Parliament talking in the way that the Leader  of the Opposition, the Deputy Leader of the  Opposition are talking. They're demonstrating  - both of them - their unfitness for high office  in this country.

And to answer your question, Lyndal, the

arrangement with Papua New Guinea is  exactly the way in which countries reach  agreements, that countries reach

arrangements. Papua New Guinea is a  sovereign nation, has offered this to Australia,  to take all people arriving by boat without a  visa as transferees to Papua New Guinea, and  we have said that's going to be the

arrangement and that we will support all  people transferred to Papua New Guinea and  support Papua New Guinea in providing  services to them. That's an arrangement  between nations. It's a perfectly standard way  of doing business.

CURTIS:                                 Is there going to be any more detailed written

agreements going through some of the finer  detail that is in a fact sheet on the Immigration  Department's website but not in the  agreement, like how children and families will  be transferred, unaccompanied minors will be  transferred after conditions are right, and  what happens to people in Papua New Guinea  - asylum seekers - who are not deemed to be  refugees?

DREYFUS:                              Well, that's a matter - just to answer the

second part of your question first - that's a  matter for Papua New Guinean law. Papua  New Guinea has arrangements for refugees,  arrangements for processing and they will  determine what is to happen to people who  are determined not to be genuine refugees  after assessment in Papua New Guinea. Some  of them will be returned to their countries of  origin. Some of them will be returned to other-  to a safe - will be sent to a safe third country.  That's a matter for Papua New Guinea. We'll of  course assist Papua New Guinea in that  processing task, and give them the benefit of  things we've learned in processing of refugee  claims.

On the other details, Lyndal, all of them are

going to continue to be worked out. What the  Prime Minister, and Minister Bourke, and the  Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea made  clear in making the announcement last Friday,  was that from now all people arriving by boat  without a visa will - in Australia - will be sent to  Papua New Guinea, and will not be resettled in

Australia. That's the key to this. And of course  there are details about locations in Papua New  Guinea, details about services in Papua New  Guinea, more details to be worked out about  safeness of places that people can be  transferred to, the appropriateness of  accommodation that is available, all of those  are details which we are capable of working  out and will be working out.

CURTIS:                                 Just to be clear - because this is another

question the Opposition has raised - if Papua  New Guinea says to Australia: we want to send  some of the people who have been found not  to be refugees back to Australia, Australia will  say no?

DREYFUS:                              We have made it very clear, and this is a

matter for Australia, it's a matter we've made  very clear in our discussions and in the  arrangement with Papua New Guinea, that no  people arriving by boat without a visa who are  transferred to Papua New Guinea will be  resettled in Australia. I can't be clearer about  that. You will not be resettled in Australia.  That's the message. And any suggestion by the  Opposition that is deliberately trying to  undermine the clarity of that message is not in  our national interest. And I say again, the  Opposition Leader should be ashamed of  himself; he's shown again how unfit he is for  high office in Australia.

CURTIS:                                 Peter O'Neill, the Papua New Guinean Prime

Minister, said yesterday that as part of this  agreement Papua New Guinea had more

control over the way the Australian aid budget  would be spent, that Papua New Guinea could  set the priorities. The Opposition has said  today that it's handing cash - handing money  to the Papua New Guinea Government, that  it's a bonanza for Papua New Guinea. Has  Australia given up control over the way its aid  money will be spent?

DREYFUS:                              Again, Mr Abbott, either wilfully, or perhaps

because he doesn't understand, is showing a  fundamental misunderstanding of our aid  program. We give aid to developing countries  around the world, and you can't simply give  aid on a unilateral basis, it's a bilateral  arrangement. We work constructively and  cooperatively with the countries in our region  and around the world, the developing  countries to whom our aid goes. And it's up to  them to direct where they think the aid is best  spent - it's up to us to decide whether we will  in fact accept their specifications of where aid  is to go but we work together, with Papua New  Guinea, with Indonesia, with countries around  the world in our aid program. And I think it's a  bit sad to see that Mr Abbott apparently  doesn't understand that.

CURTIS:                                 Finally, you were part of the opening of the

new ASIO building in Canberra today. It's a  very large building, are you going to fill it?

DREYFUS:                              It is a large building. It's appropriate that it be

a large building. There's been a substantial  increase in the numbers of people working for  ASIO, as well - as was announced today - there

will be a co-tenant, the Australian Cyber  Security Centre. And that's a coordinating  body to bring together all of the cyber-security  activities across  government and the bits of  different security agencies that are concerned  with cyber security. It's a very good co-tenant  for ASIO in what is, you're right Lyndal, a large  building, but an appropriate building  demonstrating the resourcing that we have  given, as a Government, to ASIO.

CURTIS:                                 Now, it's named after Ben Chifley because I

think he put in the legislation to set up ASIO in  the first place. There's also his instructions to  ASIO there as well?

DREYFUS:                              There are. It's a very appropriate name to be

called the Ben Chifley Building. Ben Chifley was  the Prime Minister who founded the  Australian Security Intelligence Organisation,  and on display in a glass case in the building  you will see the very first instructions that Ben  Chifley gave to the first Director-General.  They're expressed in particularly clear  language. I'd commend them to everyone.

CURTIS:                                 Did they stand the test of time?

DREYFUS:                              They do stand the test of time. Some would

regret that we're not still  using language of  that clarity, explaining to ASIO in a page-and-a-half what their task was going to be, to look  after the nation's security.

CURTIS:                                 Mark Dreyfus, thank you for your time.

DREYFUS:                              Thank you, Lyndal.
