TONY ABBOTT:

Well, look, thanks for coming. First of all, I want to say that the Coalition joins with other Australians in  commiserating with the people of Japan. This has been a terrible disaster on a massive scale. We don’t know  yet what the final death toll will be but obviously it will be very high and there will be a long and difficult  recovery process. So, the thoughts and prayers of the Australian people go out to the people of Japan. I  called the Japanese Ambassador Sato yesterday to convey my personal condolences as well as those of the  Coalition to the Japanese government and people at this very difficult time. It’s good that Australia has been  able to offer some practical help and I wish the search and rescue teams all the best as they head off to Japan  in this grim but necessary task.

Obviously, there are many Australians in Japan. It’s estimated that there were probably 11,000 Australians  in Japan at the time of the quake. Close to 200 Australians are registered in the worst affected areas. Let’s  hope they’re all found safe and sound. I know that our consular officials are doing everything they can to  help and I wish them well in that necessary and important task.

Plainly, many Australians would be concerned at the moment about their friends and relatives in Japan and I  would urge people to make use of the consular number 1300 555 135 if they have concerns.

I would just like to make a couple of observations about the carbon tax debate. Government ministers have  been talking about the carbon tax debate this morning and I think it’s appropriate even on a day such as this  that I briefly respond. I think it was obvious from watching the Climate Change Minister today that the  Government is in denial about the price impacts of this change. Minister Combet insisted that it would just  have a modest impact on our cost of living. Well, I don’t believe that a $300 a year hit on your power bills  and a six and a half cents a litre hit on your petrol bills is modest and we’ve got to remember that this is just  for starters, this is just at a $26 a tonne carbon price and there are some reports that the carbon price will  have to be much, much higher than that if it’s to have any impact on our energy usage.

The other point that was pretty obvious today watching both Minister Combet and the Treasurer is that the  Government is refusing to rule out an ad campaign. The Government has form when it comes to using  millions of dollars of tax payers’ money to promote party political policies. I think it would be

unconscionable, unconscionable for the government to use tax payers’ money in an ad campaign on this  subject, at least before the legislation has passed the parliament.

Finally, it was interesting watching Minister Combet talk about what was going to happen to the money that  was raised by the carbon tax. Mr Combet seems to think that this is about redistribution as much as about the  environment. It’s about redistributing money rather than protecting the environment and I’ve been saying all  along that, as far as the Labor Party is concerned, they want a great big new tax to create a great big new  slush fund to generate great big new handouts to protect their political position.

So, any questions?

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott this morning Kevin Rudd said on ABC24 news, he’s demanded a briefing from the Japanese  Foreign Minister on the extent of nuclear leakage from the reactor. Is that appropriate language?

TONY ABBOTT:

This is really a matter for the Government. Kevin Rudd is the Australian Foreign Minister. I presume that he  is speaking with the full authority of the Prime Minister and of the Australian Government. I think that the  difficulty at the moment is that it seems the Australian government may not be speaking with one voice. It  seems that the Foreign Minister and the Prime Minister might be saying slightly different things to different  people but this is really something for the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister to clear up. There does  seem to be issues. It seems that they’re not consistent and they’re not communicating, but that’s something  that they have to fix up.

QUESTION:

Well, could it be a serious problem for Australia?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think that, as Stephen Smith pointed out the other week, there cannot be a cigarette paper of difference  between the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister if Australia’s foreign policy is to be an effective one  and my concern at the moment is that the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister may have a dysfunctional  relationship, and if they have a dysfunctional relationship Australia could end up with a dysfunctional  foreign policy.

QUESTION:

If you were Prime Minister would you demand from the Japanese government to know [inaudible]  radioactive leak [inaudible] today?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well I’m not the Prime Minister, so I’m going to ask the Prime Minister to ensure that the Australian  Government speaks with one voice.

QUESTION:

Do you think that what has happened in Japan with regards to the nuclear plant, is that going to set back the  nuclear debate here in Australia?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, this isn’t really a day for that debate. I just point out, for the record, that the Coalition has no policy to  promote nuclear power in this country.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, how concerned are you about the break-out of a second group of asylum seekers on Christmas  Island?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think this is the kind of thing that happens when you’ve got thousands of people in immigration detention  and the only way to ensure that this kind of thing doesn’t happen is to stop the boats. Now, the Coalition has  strong policies in place that we believe would stop the boats were we in government. These were policies  that worked before and they can work again. It just requires a government with the strength of will to  actually put them into effect.

QUESTION:

Does it, further give support to the Government’s idea of moving more people off Christmas Island to  Darwin to ease the overcrowding?

TONY ABBOTT:

It doesn’t matter where you’ve got thousands of people in immigration detention, there’s the risk of a break  out because people understandably enough would prefer not to be in detention. So, the best way to handle  this is to stop the boats. The sooner we can stop the boats the better and that means significantly different,  dramatically different policies from the Government.

Thanks so much.
