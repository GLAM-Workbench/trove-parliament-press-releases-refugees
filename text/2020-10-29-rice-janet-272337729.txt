GOVERNMENT SHOULD REVISIT U.S. OFFER TO REPATRIATE  AUSTRALIAN WOMEN AND CHILDREN STILL STRANDED IN SYRIA

10/29/2020

The Greens have called on the Morrison Government to revisit the United States’  offer to repatriate Australian women and children of ISIS families, stranded in the  Al Roj camp in Syria.

Senator Janet Rice, Greens Foreign Affairs spokesperson said:

“Minister Payne has confirmed in Senate Estimates that Australia has not

contacted the US to discuss its offer to extract and repatriate Australian women  and children stuck in the Al Roj refugee camp.

“The Australian Government has also failed to discuss repatriation with the Kurdish  authorities, nor has it sought to contact these Australians despite acknowledging  that it could ask the Kurdish authorities to do so.

“Innocent Australian children are languishing in Syria, in a desperate and dire  situation, with their lives put at significant and unnecessary risk. The Australian

Government should be doing whatever is in its power to bring them home.

“These children are not responsible for their parents actions and Australia must  take responsibility for their safety.



“We urge Minister Payne to discuss the US offer with her counterpart, rather than  rejecting it out of hand without due consideration.”
