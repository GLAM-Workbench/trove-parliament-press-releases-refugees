5AA Adelaide - Mornings  Thursday, 16 December 2010  Topics: Christmas Island



LAINIE ANDERSON:  The braking news of course is these dramatic rescue efforts over in Christmas Island. The  awful case of the asylum seeker boat breaking into the cliffs on Christmas Island. We have  been very lucky to get hold of Brendan O’Connor who is the Home Affairs and Justice  Minister with the Federal Government. He joins us now, hello Minster.

BRENDAN O’CONNOR:  Hi there. How are you?

LAINIE ANDERSON:            Good thank you. Thank you so much for your time today, can you give us an update on  what’s happening with the efforts over on Christmas Island?

BRENDAN O’CONNOR:      Yes, look, firstly it’s clear that this is a very serious and tragic incident and facts are still  emerging of course and it will be some time before we get the full picture of what has  happened. But is has been confirmed to me that there have been twenty-eight people that  have perished and there are forty-four people who have been rescued. And our focus now, on  the island, is ensuring that we continue the rescue but we also continue to focus on the care  for those that have survived. And I’m working with the AFP and customs and speaking with  those, the hospital and medical practitioners about, about what we need to do to focus on the  interest of those people.

LAINIE ANDERSON:            We know that two survivors have been flown to Perth, are the rest being cared for on  Christmas Island or are there plans to move them across the Australia?

BRENDAN O’CONNOR:      We’ve had the Royal Flying Doctors Service arrive late evening or early evening yesterday  and indeed that was to transport two people who had suffered serious injuries to Perth. And  the hospital is coping very well here and has admitted, I’m told, five or six patients and there  is in fact room for more if, if more need to be admitted. Others have been looked after at the  reception centre and we have three doctors at the hospital and therefore the medical and  health response has been magnificent. In fact, the hospital set up a triage situation at the site  so they were very well prepared once people were being rescued. And when they were

brought to land, they were attended to very quickly and I commend the effort of those  involved.

LAINIE ANDERSON:            It must have been- can’t even begin to imagine the trauma of those actually on board the boat,  but the people of Christmas Island who stood unable to actually help on the cliff tops.  Obviously hearing last night that there’s quite a bit of anger on the island. What’s the  impression you’re getting from locals?

BRENDAN O’CONNOR:      Well, I pay tribute to the efforts of all involved. There’s no doubt that because of their  maritime experience they have, they’ve responded extraordinarily well. The Australian  Federal Police, Customs and Border Protection, Parks Australia, volunteers, commercial  diving operators, commercial fishing operators- all rallied together. Without their efforts and  the very brave efforts of the crew of the Triton and the HMAS Pirie, there would have been  more lives lost. There’s no doubt in my mind.

LAINIE ANDERSON:            Has there been any thought given to actually counselling some of the people who, who  actually watched that tragedy unfold from the cliff-tops?

BRENDAN O’CONNOR:      Yes, DIAC have counselling services on the island, indeed I addressed the community, many  of whom were involved in the rescue, and yesterday, last night, and certainly impressed upon  them to access those counselling services. Also I’ve spoken with agencies to make sure that  we sufficient counselling services and I’m, it’s been affirmed that we do at this point. But  there’s no doubt people have had a very difficult experience and I have encouraged people to  access the services that are available to them there because of the, as I say, because of the  quite traumatic experience of doing what has been, in the end, quite a heroic thing.

LAINIE ANDERSON:            I know it’s very early days in the investigations but there have been reports today that an  Australian vessel did spot this asylum seeker boat at some stage before the, the accident  occurred. Have you been able to verify that?

BRENDAN O’CONNOR:      I’ve spoken to officers of the Triton and the HMAS Pirie to personally thank them for their  extraordinary efforts in what is a very, very dangerous situation. I mean, you really do have  to appreciate the circumstances in which people were rescuing others. There were high  swells, there was a development of cyclones just off Christmas Island. The visibility was  very, very low because of low fog. And so, where the vessel was, was where there was very  steep cliffs, so the situation was very difficult. And I’m advised that both vessels responded  very quickly for this situation.

And, indeed, they had their tenders and the smaller vessels advance before they got there  because they are faster vessels, to start taking people of the water. If they hadn’t, and they  took out a very significant number of people. But it was explained to me that the sea was like  being in a washing machine and if you can understand then how hard it would be to rescue  people in those circumstances, you really do then start to fully appreciate the bravery of

people involved.



LAINIE ANDERSON:            Yeah, the television footage of the seas and the, the actual Australian navy officers who were  trying to save them were, were unbelievable, I completely agree with you there. Do you think  though that this tragedy signals a need for a change in Australia’s immigration policies?

BRENDAN O’CONNOR:      Look, I think it’s far too early to be reflecting on those matters. Of course we know that this  issue of people moving around the globe is a significant challenge for all nations. And,  indeed, it’s been a challenge, indeed for this country, for some time. It’s not the first time, of  course, that we’ve dealt with such challenges and we’ll continue to work through those. But  for today, and certainly for the foreseeable future, my focus as Minister will be doing  whatever I can to assist the agencies here, help those people both in terms of those rescued,  helping the families of, of the victims and, indeed, making sure that the locals who were  involved in the rescue are, are also properly attended to. That’s my focus today, as I think is  proper.

LAINIE ANDERSON:            We really appreciate your time today, I’m sure you’re absolutely frantic out there on  Christmas Island. Thank you very much for your time, Brendan O’Connor.

BRENDAN O’CONNOR:      Not at all.

LAINIE ANDERSON:            Brendan O’Connor there, the Federal Minister for Home Affairs and Justice. It’s 11:42 here  on 5AA and we’re very lucky and fortunate to be able get a hold of him on such as busy day  out there.
