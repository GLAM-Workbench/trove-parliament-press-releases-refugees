BUDGET CUTS FUNDS FOR

ASSISTED PASSAGES

Despite constraints of the Budget, it had been possible

to retain assisted passages for sponsored spouses and

dependent children, for some refugees, and for certain

skilled workers urgently needed in industry, the Minister

for Labor and Immigration, Senator McClelland, said today

The reduction in funds for assisted passages had made it

necessary to suspend passage assistance for dependent

parents. About 40 per cent of dependent parents who had

joined their families in Australia in recent times had

benefited from assisted passages.
