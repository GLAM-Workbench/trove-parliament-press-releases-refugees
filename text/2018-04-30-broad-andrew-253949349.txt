$15 MILLION FOR FOOD AND SHELTER IN ROHINGYA CAMPS

Federal Member for Mallee, Mr Andrew Broad MP has welcomed the announcement of a  further $15 million in humanitarian assistance from The Australian Government to help  assist with food and shelter in Rohingya refugee camps.

The additional funding will provide food to more than 700,000 people in Cox’s Bazar, and  high nutrient porridge to more than 100,000 children under the age of five and to  breastfeeding or pregnant women.

Mr Broad was very pleased to see the funding announcement following his trip to Cox’s  Bazar earlier this year,

“The need is indescribable, so it is fantastic that as a Government we can help address  some of that need, be it food, shelter or health services,

With this $15 million our total humanitarian contribution to the Rohingya crisis is now at  $46.5 million,” Mr Broad said.

The extra funding is also set to support child protection services, counselling and  medical services for women and girls who have been through sexual and gender-based  violence.

The United Nations estimates approximately 900,000 Rohingya are now living in the  Cox’s Bazar area of Bangladesh, including more than 680,000 who have fled from  Myanmar since August 2017. They are dependent on humanitarian aid for survival.
