BORDER PROTECTION COMMAND INTERCEPTS VESSEL

A suspected illegal entry vessel was intercepted today by the Royal Australian Navy patrol  boat HMAS Launceston and the Customs and Border Protection vessel Holdfast Bay, both  operating under the control of Border Protection Command, approximately 23 nautical miles  north of the Tiwi Islands.

The vessel was earlier sighted by a Customs and Border Protection Dash 8 aircraft.

Initial indications are that there are 31 passengers and 3 crew on board.

The Minister for Home Affairs, Bob Debus, said the successful interception demonstrated the  effectiveness of Border Protection Command’s targeted surveillance program.

“The Australian Government continues to deal effectively and appropriately with people  smugglers and the group will be transferred to Christmas Island where they will undergo  health, security and other checks to establish their identity and reasons for travel.”
