EO&E...........................................................................................................................................

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, it’s terrific to be here at the Reid Campaign Office to support Craig Laundy and his very enthusiastic team. We are about

building a better Australia and as those of you who watch television tonight will know, we are starting our campaign, in effect,  today. We think that this is a critically important election and we are offering the people of Australia Real Solutions that will make

their lives better. We will build a stronger economy so that everyone can get ahead, we’ll abolish the carbon tax, we’ll payback  Labor’s debt and we’ll stop the boats - that’s what we’re offering the people of Australia - it’s a message of Hope, Reward and

Opportunity, it’s what we need after six years of chaos, division and dysfunction.

I’m really pleased to be here with Craig Laundy, our outstanding candidate and Craig, I might ask you to say a few words.

CRAIG LAUNDY:

Thank you, Tony and thank you for coming once again to Reid. Look, there will be ads going to air today and I think the tag line,  the last line, on those is very important and I think it’s a question that all Australians must take very seriously between now and

the next election, as they stand in the ballot box on whatever day that election may be; what does the future of this country look  like if this Government is re-elected? But I want to take it probably one step further; what is in the future for your children and your

grandchildren? That’s the question, Tony, we’re reminding people in Reid, day-in, day-out and we will continue between now and  the next election because we believe it is the most important decision this country has made in its future.

TONY ABBOTT:

Do we have any questions?

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, the Government’s change from a carbon tax to an ETS, how does that damage your election campaign?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, nothing has been announced to the best of my knowledge. What we’ve seen from this Government is a consistent attempt to

manipulate the news by briefing things out and the news briefings aren’t followed by specific announcements. So in effect, Kevin  Rudd yet again is using the media for his own purposes and I’m surprised people allow themselves to be used in this way. But on

the assumption that there is going to be a change, look, it’s just another Kevin con job. He’s changed its name but he hasn’t  abolished the tax. You will still pay and it will still hurt, it’s as simple as that. Another Kevin con job. He’s changed its name, he

hasn’t abolished the tax. You will still pay and it will still hurt.

QUESTION:

Why is it a con then Mr Abbott when Julia Gillard already indicated a shift to an ETS by 2015?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, what he’s trying to say is that he is somehow against a carbon tax but in fact he was a senior minister in the Government  that voted for the carbon tax, he was the senior minister in the Government that told us that the carbon tax was going to be good

for you, now he’s admitting that the carbon tax is in fact very, very bad for us, but my point is; Kevin, Kevin, Kevin, you just don’t

get it. If it’s bad at $23 a tonne, it’s bad at $10 a tonne. It’s a bad tax; you’ve just got to get rid of it. No point re-badging it, just get  rid of it.

QUESTION:

But you were also a proponent of carbon pricing at one point?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, the thing about this tax is that the more you see of it the worse it gets. The longer you look at it, the more of a disaster it is

for our country and if it’s true that Labor is on the point of moving from a fixed tax to a floating tax, it essentially has indicated  everything the Coalition has been saying about this all along. It’s a bad tax, it’s bad for families, it’s bad for jobs, it’s bad for

everyone.

QUESTION:

Do you think any changes to the carbon policy should be put to parliament before the election?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well look, that’s really a matter for Mr Rudd. We know Mr Rudd’s not fair dinkum about this. We know this is more fake change  from Kevin Rudd. As I said, if he was fair dinkum he wouldn’t just change its name, he’d abolish the tax.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, would you rather go to an early election or a later election?

TONY ABBOTT:

It’s not about me. You know, that’s the interesting thing; it is as far as Kevin is concerned all about him, but it shouldn’t be about

Kevin, it shouldn’t be about me, it should be about the people of Australia. That’s what it should be about; and the only one in this  election who is promising to abolish the carbon tax, is the Coalition; the only side in this election with a plan to stop the boats, is

the Coalition; the only side in this election with a plan to get debt and deficit down, is the Coalition. So you can have more division  and dysfunction with Labor, or you can have Real Solutions under the Coalition.

QUESTION:

You say this election shouldn’t be about the Prime Minister yet your new campaign ads are attacking his personality, does that

show that the Coalition is getting a bit desperate?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I just don’t accept that and I think you should look at them because if you actually looked at them you would see that there’s  two ads. One ad is promoting our Real Solutions plan, which will promote Hope, Reward and Opportunity for the Australian

people. The other is simple facts about Kevin Rudd’s record in Government. He began the spendathon, he wasted money, he  promised to do things which he never delivered and worst of all he started up the boats. Kevin Rudd is the best friend that the

people smugglers have ever had.

QUESTION:

On that point, is there any scope to, if parliament does return before the election, is there any scope for you to negotiate further  with the Government, short of them adopting your policies on border protection lock, stock and barrel?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I want to know what Kevin Rudd’s plan is. I mean Kevin Rudd has no plan to stop the boats. He started the boats but he has

no plan to stop the boats. In fact Kevin Rudd has no plans at all for our country. He had a plan to tear down an incumbent Prime  Minister but he has no plan to make our country great and that’s the problem; Kevin Rudd’s planning is all about Kevin Rudd, it’s

not about our country.

QUESTION:

A question about the health and education bureaucracies is that when Labor came in, health went from so many million to $3.3

billion and education has gone from $6 million, this is just bureaucracy, to well in the billions, how would your government deal  with those costs?

TONY ABBOTT:

We want to see an efficient government, we don’t want to see a big bloated bureaucracy and that’s one of the reasons why we’ve

said that the commonwealth public sector payroll in Canberra would be reduced by at least 12,000 under a Coalition government.

QUESTION:

In light of the recent asylum seeker boat disaster, what will the Coalition do to prevent something like this happening again?

TONY ABBOTT:

The only way to stop the deaths is to stop the boats. You can’t keep the boats coming and avoid the deaths. There’s no safe way  to come on a leaky boat to Australia. So not only is it the right thing to do to stop the boats, it’s the compassionate thing to do to

stop the boats.

QUESTION:

The Greens are asking Mr Rudd to go visit Manus Island detention centre while he’s in PNG, they are hoping, you know, to shut  the centre down, what are your thoughts on that?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think it’s very important that we have rigorous offshore processing at places like Nauru and Manus. We believe in it, the

Government doesn’t and that’s why they were so slow opening these centres and that’s why so few people have actually gone to  them.

QUESTION:

On the reduction of the public sector payroll, how long would that take to meet that goal? Was that a first term commitment or is

that something that’s ongoing and what proportion of that would be through involuntary redundancy?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, we’ve said that it will all be through natural attrition. We want government to be no bigger than it has to be and obviously it’s  much bigger than it needs to be right now.

QUESTION:

Just on the education funding deal, your Opposition spokesman says that an overwhelming majority of states need to sign up to

the deal, where you’re saying it’s all or nothing, so which is it? Why are you at odds with your Education spokesman?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I don’t accept any of the premises in your statement, that’s not really a question, that’s really a statement but let’s imagine  that it’s a question. The fact is, this is not a good deal because if you are going to do Gonski you need $6.5 billion a year in order

to ensure that no school is worse off and there just isn’t $6.5 billion a year available from state and federal sources. Now, at the  moment, not only has the Government not got all of the states, it hasn’t even got a majority of the states and frankly, it’s highly

unlikely to get anymore of the states because there isn’t the money and there aren’t the changes on offer that the states are  demanding. We all want better schools but the way to get better schools is to have more principal autonomy, better teachers,

better teaching, better curriculum and more parental engagement. Sure, in a perfect world there’d be more money too but the best  way to better schools, as I say, more principal autonomy, better teachers, better teaching, more parental involvement and a

stronger curriculum.

Thanks so much.
