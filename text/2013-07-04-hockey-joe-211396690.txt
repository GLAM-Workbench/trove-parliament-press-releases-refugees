HON JOE HOCKEY MP  SHADOW TREASURER

2013 HOUSING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION SUMMIT   SOFITEL SYDNEY WENTWORTH  THURSDAY 4 JULY 2013



**CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY**

As  someone who has  been involved with the property industry for all  my life, I know how  significant confidence is to the property market.

Obviously the balance between supply and demand is crucial.

I know that there are many influences on supply such as land release, timely approvals and  affordable construction costs.

I  also  know  that  there  are  many  influences  on  demand  such  as  affordable  and  accessible   credit, low unemployment and good job security as well as a reasonable level of immigration.

But it is confidence that binds all the fundamentals together.

We will never have a return to confidence whilst the broken and dysfunctional Labor Party is  running the country.

Events in Canberra are not the normal and I want to begin by touching on those events today.



Politics

We could be forgiven for thinking that in 2013 we are back to the future.

In  2010  we  had  one  Prime  Minister  who  was  elected  but  discovered  months  out  from  an   election that we would be voting for another.

Now  we  are  in  2013  only  months  out  from  an  election  and  the  Prime  Minister  has  been   changed again - back to the one we elected in 2007!

Who knows who will be PM after the election if Labor wins. One thing is for sure, if Kevin  Rudd is re-elected in a few weeks’ time he will not last three years. The faceless men will be  back.

The instability will last another three years.

2



The dysfunction will continue.

And the only way Labor  can be re-elected  is  on  Green  preferences.  We  all  know  what  that  means.

With the return of Kevin Rudd to the Prime Ministership, the Labor Party wants to take you  back to the halcyon days of the “Kevin 07” election campaign.

They hope you will forget the chaotic days in 2010 before Mr Rudd was brought down by his  disloyal deputy.

But whether Labor takes us back to 2007 or to 2010, one thing is for sure - Labor has no plan  to take us into the future.

It seems we now have two oppositions but no government.

The new Prime Minister is promising a fresh start on a range of policy issues, conveniently  forgetting  that  it  was  his  government  and  then  his  successor’s  government  that  created  the   mess in the first place.

Labor can’t run on their record because their own actions show they made a hash of it.

They  can’t  run  on  the  record  of the  old  Rudd  government  because  their  own  party   acknowledged its failure when they replaced Mr Rudd with Ms Gillard.

They  can’t  run  on  the  record  of  the  Gillard  government  because  their  own  party   acknowledged its failure with the replacement of Ms Gillard with Mr Rudd.

They  can’t  run  on  trust  because  both  Ms  Gillard  and  Mr  Rudd  pledged  support  for  their   leaders shortly before sinking in the knife.

Ironically  Kevin  even  said  just  a  few  months  ago  that  you  will  have  to  get  past  me  if  you   want to take on Julia Gillard. Gee Kevin Rudd should be a licenced bodyguard!

They can’t run on the success of their policies because there have been abject failures on so  many  fronts  including  failure  to  stop  illegal  maritime  arrivals,  cost  blowouts  and  under   delivery  of  the NBN,  paltry  revenue  collections  from  the  mining  tax,  faltering  economic   growth  and  rising  unemployment,  continuous  budget  deficits,  ever  rising  government  debt,   decreased competition in banking and the list goes on.

Given this history the faceless men decided their only option was to fall back on the “switch  and promise” tactics of NSW Labor, and indeed  of the 2010 Federal election, replacing the  leader  and  promising  that  they  had  learnt  their  lesson  and  would  change  their  ways  if  re-elected.

I don’t believe the Australian people will fall for this tactic again.

Ms Gillard came to the Prime Ministership promising to fix the boats, fix the mining tax and  to not introduce a carbon tax.

3



Instead the boat arrivals have increased, the mining tax has been an abysmal failure, and the  carbon tax goes up and up and increases the cost of living even while it is six times the price  of carbon credits in Europe.

Prime  Minister  Rudd  now  says  he  will  fix  these  problems….just  like  his  replacement   did….but haven’t we heard all this before?

Labor wants you to take it on trust that they have changed and that their policy solutions will  work.

Well they haven’t worked before and they won’t work now.

Labor shows consistency in only one thing and that is failure.

If  Labor  can’t  rely on the  Prime  Minister  to  deliver  in  government  then  why  should  the   Australian people?

If Labor can’t trust the Prime Minister then why should the Australian people?



Economics

This  “new”  Rudd  government  promises  to  be  fiscally  responsible,  just  like  the  “old”  Rudd   and the “new” Gillard governments did.

But rhetoric is one thing and reality is another.

Recent announcements suggest nothing has changed and this “new” government will go for  broke with a mountain of election spending promises.

Already  there  have  been  leaks  about  increased  Newstart  payments,  lower  company  tax  for   small business, more spending on infrastructure, offshore asylum seeker processing centres in  Indonesia, naval frigates for the Indonesians, reversing higher education cuts and increasing  funding for Gonski.

Of  course  there  have  been  no  leaks  on  where  the  money  is  coming  from  and  the  clear   message is that it is all going on the credit card.

I note that Mr Bowen has been Treasurer now for nearly a week yet we have heard little of  his thinking on the major issues facing Australia.

At the media conference following the latest RBA decision he made two curious statements.

The  first  was  that  Labor  was  good  at  managing  economic  transitions,  and  he  quoted  the   Hawke/Keating  government  as  an  example.    The  problem  with  this  is  that  Mr  Keating   managed the economy into the recession we had to have.  This is hardly the benchmark for  successful economic management.

The  second  was  that  he  stood  by  Labor’s  fiscal  rule  that  the  budget  would  be  returned to  surplus over the economic cycle.

4





The problem with this is that that is not the fiscal rule.  The medium-term fiscal strategy is to  achieve budget surpluses on average over the medium term.1  But I note that the Minister  for Finance is playing it both ways, reaffirming both these rules2.

This is not an auspicious start for a new Treasurer.

Mr Bowen can make amends by answering the following questions.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ How quickly will he return the budget to surplus?  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ How quickly will he stabilise and repay the government’s huge debts?  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ How soon will he breach the legislated $300 billion debt limit and when will he ask  parliament for an increase?

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ What  changes  are  proposed  for  the  carbon  tax  and  what  will  be  the  impact  on  the   budget?  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ How can the revenue from the mining tax increase tenfold over the forward estimates  when commodity prices are declining?  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ What is the true cost to the budget of the blowout in illegal maritime arrivals?  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ What will be the true cost of the NBN?  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ How will he maximise economic growth?  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ How will he boost productivity?  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ How will he boost jobs growth and return the country to full employment?

The  previous  Treasurer  Wayne  Swan  grossly  mishandled  the  nation’s  finances  and  the   economy,  squandered  the  proceeds  of  our  biggest  ever  commodity price  boom  and  left  the   nation ill prepared to face the continued global uncertainty.

Labor  must  now  listen  to  the  words  of  Reserve  Bank  Governor  Glenn  Stevens  who  just   yesterday  highlighted  the  need  for  future  surplus  Budgets  to  protect  Australia  from  the   challenges ahead.

As we know, of course, Labor will promise a surplus - they did so over 500 times - but then  never deliver and they never will.

And I fear Mr Bowen will not be able to withstand the pressure from his colleagues to spend  their way to the election.

Mr  Bowen  must  tell  us  now  how  he  will  pay  for  the  promises,  fix  this  mess  and  create   prosperity and jobs for all Australians.

2  “Well,  that  is  what  the  Budget  forecasts  say  and  it's  consistent  with  the  fiscal  strategy  that  the  Labor   Government has had in place for a number of years which the Treasurer reaffirmed today and that is to return  the  budget  to  surplus  over  the  medium  term,  over  the  economic  cycle  and  that's  the  right  economic  call.”   Minister for Finance, Penny Wong, Lateline, 2 July 2013

Unstable Government

Labor  cannot  offer  stable  government  going  forward  because it  has  not  delivered  stable   government in the past.

In just six years there have been

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Six Ministers for Small Business  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Six Ministers for Housing and Homelessness  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Six Ministers for Human Services  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Five Assistant Treasurers  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Four Ministers for Immigration and Citizenship  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Four Ministers for Trade  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Four Special Ministers of State

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Four Ministers for Sport  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ NINE Ministers for education including four higher education and tertiary education  Ministers in just four months.

And now of course, three Prime Ministers with one recycled, and two Treasurers.

Given this record there can be no certainty how long the new Prime Minister and team will  last if they are re-elected.

Contrast  this  with the Coalition which has  had a stable and experienced team  with a single   dedicated leader throughout the second term of the Labor government.

We have delivered stability in opposition and we will deliver it in government.



Mr Rudd’s Broken Promises

Still  on  politics,  with  Mr  Rudd’s  return  to  high  office  we  should  reflect  on  his  ability  to  deliver on his promises.

There isn’t time to run through them all, but I have to say he hasn’t got a strong record.

Before  the  2007  election  he  talked  up  his  economic  conservatism  and  his  belief  in  budget   surpluses and tight control of government spending34.

In practice of course Kevin Rudd delivered the largest deficit in modern Australian history,  both as a percentage of GDP and in dollar terms, with a 2010 deficit of $54.5 billion.

Mr  Rudd  was  at  the  helm  for  three  Budgets  - all  deficit  Budgets  - and  the  three  deficits   totaled $129 billion.



3  “I  believe  as  an  economic  conservative  in  Budget  surpluses.”  (Source:  Kevin  Rudd,  Press  Conference,  23   October 2007)

4  “Economic conservative means a fundamental belief in budget surpluses, and you go back to my experience in  this respect.” (Source: Kevin Rudd, Interview ABC AM, 23 November 2007).

Under Mr Rudd spending as a percentage of GDP increased to 26.1% of GDP, well above the  ratio of 23.1% in the last budget of the Coalition.

Even now, at no point in the forward estimates does forecast government spending get to the  low  levels  of  spending  as  a  percentage  of  GDP  seen  in  the  last  year  of  the  Coalition   Government.

But  it  wasn’t  just  election  promises  that  Mr  Rudd  failed  to  deliver, he  was  promising   surpluses right up until he was ousted5.

We now know the 2013 promised surplus turned out to be a $19.4 billion deficit.

These broken promises have had a big impact on consumer sentiment.

Roubini Global Economics reports:

“Consumer sentiment  has  also  taken  a  hit  due  to  the  government’s  big  miss  on  the   budget this year, which reversed surprisingly strong confidence in early 2013.”6

Then there was Mr Rudd’s comment about the need for the previous Coalition government to  cut the Public Service. Mr Rudd said he was disappointed that we did not take a “meat axe’ to  the Public Service.7

Under Mr Rudd the size of the Public Service increased by around 20,000 from 238,600 in  2007 to 258,300 in 2010 - and has remained at around that level ever since.

There was also his promise not to change superannuation8.  The reality is that over the past 6  years  Labor  has  increased  taxes  on  superannuation  by  almost  $9  billion  including  a  cut  to   super benefits for lower income earners of more than $3.3 billion.

Mr  Rudd’s  track  record  suggests  you  cannot  believe  anything  he  says  or  any  promise  he   makes.



We Need an Election

For  the  second  time  under  Labor  we  have  a  Prime  Minister  who  was  not  elected  by  the   people.

It is time to let the people have a say.

This is not just my view, there is a host of third parties who say we need to sort out this mess  and  go  to  an  election  now,  including  Trevor  Rowe,  Board  member  UGL9 and  Tony   Shepherd, President, Business Council of Australia10.

Enough is enough, it is time for the Prime Minister to set the date and the earlier the better.



Housing

Enough of politics, I want to turn my attention now to housing.

Housing construction is one of the sectors which will need to rebound to help fill the gap left  by the ending of the mining investment boom.

Notwithstanding the  growth of new home  sales  in May your  organisation  is  reporting I  am   concerned that this industry is not responding as quickly as it should to lower interest rates.

The RBA cash rate has been reduced 7 times since October 2011, from a peak of 4.75% to  2.75% on 8 May.

The cash rate is now at a lower level than during the GFC and is probably at the lowest level  for half a century.

These reductions have been largely passed on to housing and business lending rates.

However, the housing industry seems to be responding more sluggishly than normal to these  lower interest rates.

New  dwelling  construction  approvals  rose  steadily  through  2012  but  that  improvement  has   slowed this year.

House prices are now moving up but that doesn’t do anything for the supply of new housing.

The  malaise  in  the  construction  sector  has  been  confirmed  by  the  latest  Master  Builders   National Survey of Building and Construction.

The  June  quarter  survey  shows  that  business  conditions  remain  below  the  “breakeven”  50   mark and are lower than recorded during the global financial crisis.

Confidence also remains below the 50 mark indicating that builders see no improvement on  the horizon.

10  Tony Shepherd, President, Business Council of Australia "We believe an early election would be a good way  of settling down business confidence," and "I think that business is on hold at the present time, and the sooner  that  that  can  be  resolved  the  better  it  will  be  for  everybody."  (Source: Rudd  tries  to  hit  'reset  button'  with   business, Jonathon Swan, SMH, 2 July 2013)

The  Master  Builders  Chief  Economist  observes  that  the  missing  ingredient  is  business  and   investor confidence.11

One consequence of this underbuilding is that Australian housing remains very expensive.

It remains very difficult for Australians to put a roof over their heads.

The Economist magazine12 shows that Australia has some of the most expensive housing in  the world.  It shows the housing market remains severely overvalued against both household  income and rents.

The  Demographia  International  Housing  Affordability  Survey  for  201313 confirms  that   Australia has  one of the most expensive housing markets14. It  uses  house prices divided  by  gross annual median household income.

It  also  shows  the  problem  is  not  just  confined  to  the  major  cities  but  is  also  an  issue  in   regional cities and towns.

Of  the  337  housing  markets  surveyed,  Australia  had  eight  out  of  the  20  most  unaffordable   locations.   This  included  Sydney  and  Melbourne  - no  surprises  there  - but  also  Port   Macquarie, Coffs Harbour and Wollongong in NSW, Sunshine Coast in Qld, and Mandurah  in WA.

More telling, Australia currently has no housing markets ranked as affordable or moderately  unaffordable.

So why are housing prices in Australia so high?

Demographia suggests that higher land prices are a major factor15 and that a key reason for  expensive land is inadequate release of new land for development16.

It also notes that affordable housing is a critical component of economic sustainability.

Australia does not so much have a problem with excess demand for housing, it has a problem  with inadequate supply.

Put simply, inadequate supply of land leads to inadequate supply of new housing.



11  Master Builders National Survey of Building and Construction, June Quarter 2013

12  The Economist, 18 May 2013

13  9th Annual Demographia International Housing Affordability Survey: 2013

14  9th Annual Demographia International Housing Affordability Survey: 2013: “All major markets in Australia  continued to be severely unaffordable, reflecting vastly over-priced housing”.

15  Ibid.  “The housing affordability problem can be principally traced to the failure to maintain a competitive  land supply.”

16  Ibid. “Only 0.18% of Australian land is used for urban areas, by far the smallest figure of any geographies  covered….urban containment policies may be the most deeply entrenched in this land-rich country.”

Other  commentators17 note  that  inadequate  housing  construction  is  linked  to  costly   development  fees  that  disproportionally  charge  the  cost  of  necessary  infrastructure  on  new   house buyers.

Land release policies and development fees are issues for state governments.

But that does not mean the issues can be ignored by the Commonwealth government.

I am already on the public record as advocating incentive payments to the states, underpinned  by suitable performance targets, to accelerate the release of land and lower the costs of new  construction.



What the States are Doing

Some  of  the  states  are  now  rejigging  their  assistance  packages  for  housing  to  make  them   more effective in boosting the supply of new stock.

I particularly like what the NSW government is doing in this area although it is not the only  one.

In NSW they have realised that the problem in the housing market is not a lack of demand but  rather a lack of supply.

So they have redirected government support towards encouraging increased construction and  purchase of new housing.

The  first  home  owners  grant  has  been  more  than  doubled  to  $15,000  and  is  now  available   only for new housing.

There is a $5,000 grant available to all purchasers of new homes although first home buyers  cannot double dip.

And there are stamp duty concessions for first home buyers purchasing a brand new home or  vacant land intended to be used as a site for a first home.

All  of  these  measures  are  capped  according  to  the  value  of  the  home,  so  that  government   money is clearly directed at increasing the supply of affordable housing.

The  NSW  government  has  also  directed  additional  funding  to  building  the  infrastructure   needed to facilitate increased construction of housing in greenfield sites18.

This is all smart policy, designed to get maximum effect from scarce government money.

I also believe the Victorian government is going down the right track.

It  has  rejigged  its  first  home  buyer  grant  from  1  July  this  year,  providing  $10,000  for   purchases  of  new  homes.   And  it  provides  concessions  on  stamp  duty for  first  home  buyer   purchases of homes, although still for both established and new.

Coalition Policies

The Coalition has a positive plan for Australia’s future.

WE WILL RESTORE CONFIDENCE.

We  have  announced  detailed  policies  across  the  full  spectrum  of  priorities  in  our  52-page  policy document “Our Plan - Real Solutions for all Australians”.

The core of this is a positive plan to create a diverse powerhouse economy that can create one  million new jobs over the next five years - and two million new jobs over the next decade.

Let there be no doubt.

We will restore prudent public finances - we will get rid of the waste and get Australia back  on a fiscally sustainable path.

We will stabilise and repay the debt.

We will have respect for taxpayers by lowering taxes, starting with the removal of the carbon  and mining taxes, and delivering lower personal income taxes without the carbon tax.

We will boost productivity, with our six point productivity plan.

We will have  a  closer  and  stronger  relationship  with  Asia,  based  on  real  action,  not  just  a   whitepaper.

We have the record to prove we can do it.  Last time we gained office the Coalition put the  budget back into surplus, repaid Labor’s $96 billion net debt, left money in the bank and an  unemployment rate with a 4 in front of it.

But  more  important  than  this,  if  elected,  we  will  offer  consistency  and  stability  in   Government.

The circus has to stop.

Labor wants to take you back to a future you have already seen.

The Coalition will take you resolutely forward with a strong leader and a united team.

It is time to go forward to the future, not back.

It is time for a Coalition government.
