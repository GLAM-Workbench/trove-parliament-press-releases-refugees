Australian Greens statement on Sri Lankan elections

“The Australian Greens welcome the outcome of the Sri Lankan election, which has  seen former president Mahinda Rajapaksa fail to return to power as the country’s prime  minister,” Senator Scott Ludlam said today.

“I hope that this signals a new chapter for this nation which has been plagued by horrific  civil war, war crimes and crimes against humanity, forced disappearances and ongoing  human rights abuses that are currently under investigation by the United Nations.

“Australia has appeased the former regime, formally inviting and hosting members of the  Rajapaksa family, failing to support the UN investigation and continuing to send asylum  seekers back to Sri Lanka.

“The election of Maithripala Sirisena in January, and the reaffirmation of that decision  today is important for Sri Lanka and the people, particularly the Tamil community, who  are vulnerable to persecution.
