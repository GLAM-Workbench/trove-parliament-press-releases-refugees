Prime Minister, what’s the aim of today’s meeting?

Â

PRIME MINISTER

Â

Today’s meeting is to have a constructive discussion. 
I enter them in good faith, and having regard to the long-term national 
interests of Australia. The important thing for all participants to 
keep in mind is that we are talking about Australia’s economic future. 
It’s not a time for game playing by anybody. I think the Australian 
public is fed up with game playing, with posturing. We took a program 
to the electorate. We were supported. The people know what we stand 
for. Of course I will deal courteously with the Australian Democrats. 
That’s why I’ve called the meeting. I want to see whether there 
is any basis of agreement. I’m not making any predictions about that, 
I’m not speculating. I’m perfectly happy to sit down and talk for 
some time with Senator Lees about her party’s position, and I expect 
that she will do the same thing in relation to the Government’s position. 
The important thing is that the national interest should prevail over 
sectional interests, and the other comment I’d make is that it won’t 
be helpful to a positive outcome for people to be giving a running commentary 
on what they may or may not be taking to the meeting.

Does the national interest include a compromise on 
food?

Â

PRIME MINISTER

Â

That is inviting me to do the very thing I said I 
wouldn’t do. Thank you very much, we’ll see you all later.
