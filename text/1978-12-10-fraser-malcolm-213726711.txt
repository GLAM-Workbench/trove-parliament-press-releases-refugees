ELECTORATE TALK

This Parliamentary year has been notable in many respects.  First, it has been characterised by an Opposition preoccupied  with personalities. They have failed to make realistic  attempts to present and argue alternate policies —  as

an Opposition should. In this they are led by a man who  talks gloom at every possible opportunity, both inside and  outside the Parliament.

Australians expect the Opposition in the Federal Parliament  to present reasoned argument on important national issues  and to offer costed alternatives. Australians are bored

with the peripheral politics now a hallmark of the Labor  Party under its present leadership.

Although the Opposition sought to distract the nation, and  the Parliament from the business of good administration,  the Government has been getting on with the job.

In Parliament this year 211 Bills were passed. The range  of Bills demonstrates in the plainest terms the Government's  desire to act in the interests of all Australians.

Legislation has been passed against tax avoidance in a  number of areas. The Treasurer is continuing to act  swiftly and forcefully against tax avoidance schemes. Your  Government has shown its determination to stamp out abuse of

the taxation laws.

Australian industry has been supported.  Legislation to give  greater incentive to industrial research and development has  been passed. An Export Expansion Grant Scheme has been  introduced and the Export Market Development Grant Scheme  has been revitalised.

Perhaps the most significant Bill passed this year was the  legislation providing for the development of Australia's  great uranium resources. This legislation demonstrated - —  in  the starkest way —  the Government's determination to protect  the environment and the rights of our Aboriginal people.

It also demonstrated the Government's awareness of its  international obligation to provide a key energy source  for an energy-short world.

Decisions were taken that protect Australians against  disruption caused by industrial unrest.

Farmers, experiencing their best seasons for up to  15 years, now have the facilities of the Primary Industry  Bank for long-term funds at attractive interest rates. Since opening for business early last month, the Bank  has approved loans totalling more than $10 million. -

This year, the setting up of the Australian Science and  Technology Council and implementation of a number of  important new policy decisions in relation to the CSIRO  reaffirms our commitment to the development of scientific  research.

The Bills arising out of this year's Budget give effect to  the Government's economic management. We have maintained  control on Government expenditure. At the same time, our  commitment to helping those Australians not able to help  themselves remains a continuing high priority for the Government

In many areas of specific need Government payments were  substantially increased. We raised spending on aged, invalid  and widow's pension and supporting, parents benefits by  11 1/2 percent and increased spending on pensioner housing  by 40 percent. Assistance to organisations providing facilities

for the handicapped increased by 37 percent and the  handicapped child's allowance was extended to students under  25 who did not receive an invalid pension.

In the case of home care for the aged -- even though the subsidy  rate was varied to meet greatly increased demand —  total  spending will increase 14 percent to over $10 million. That  makes a rise of 83 percent in home care for the aged in the

last three Budgets.

So despite the Opposition's attempt to immerse the Parliament  in personality politics,  the Government has pressed ahead  with reforms that provide increased opportunities for  migrants, for Aboriginals, for the handicapped, the aged

and the infirm, and has further protected the rights of  individual Australians.

The Government will not be distracted from these great  programmes. We have a vision of growth and development for  Australia —  a vision of stability, security, concern for  effective help for those in need.  .

By building on the foundations already set down that  vision will be realised.
