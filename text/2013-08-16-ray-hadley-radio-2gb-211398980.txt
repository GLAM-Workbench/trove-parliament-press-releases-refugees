E&OE……………………….…………………………………………………………………

RAY HADLEY:

Opposition Leader Tony Abbott has just held that media conference where he has announced more details of  the Coalition’s policy to deal with boat people. There are currently 30,000 boat people living in Australia on  either bridging or community visas or detention, they are in detention. The Opposition Leader Tony Abbott  is on the line. Mr Abbott, good morning.

TONY ABBOTT:

Ray, good morning.

RAY HADLEY:

Under your plans what will happen to those 30,000 people that we currently have here?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, none of them can expect ever to get permanent residency if they’re found to be refugees they will get  temporary protection visas and temporary protection visas don’t allow family reunion and they don’t allow  you ever to leave and then subsequently return to our country. If you are found not to be a refugee you will  stay in detention until you go because we have got to send the strongest possible message to the people  smugglers and their customers that Australia is not a soft touch, that we are in charge of this country and we  will determine who comes here.

RAY HADLEY:

And you are saying that the refugee review tribunal will be scrapped?

TONY ABBOTT:

2



Yes, we want to exclude the refugee tribunal, the refugee review tribunal from the assessment of people who  come illegally by boat. That is the situation that existed when the Coalition was in power before and it was  part of a range of measures which did succeed in stopping the boats.

RAY HADLEY:

You would have been, I guess, amused to hear firstly the Prime Minister talk about - as The Australian  describes today - the epiphany he had yesterday for Northern Australia and then perhaps also amused this  morning to read what David Bradbury said when your Party basically said the same thing back in February.

TONY ABBOTT:

That’s right we were rubbished from a great height. We were told how irresponsible we were, how  unrealistic we were but then of course on the plane up to Darwin Mr Rudd suddenly decided that he better  play catch-up and so he scrawled out a page or so of a press release and when he went to do his press  conference yesterday he couldn’t keep his story straight. He made three different announcements yesterday.  First, that every business operating in the Territory would get a tax cut, then that only businesses operating  in Darwin would get a tax cut and then they could be operating throughout the Territory but they had to be  Territory based. So, he had three different positions and for a Prime Minister who keeps demanding that we  produce costings, even though he has never got any of his own costings right, he announced this  extraordinary policy without a single cost associated with it.

RAY HADLEY:

Do you understand the significance of this day, August 16?

TONY ABBOTT:

Yes, I do Ray because three years ago today Julia Gillard said there will be no carbon tax under the  government I lead. So, earlier today I went to a Linfox depot in Melbourne just to remind people that not  only has Kevin Rudd not abolished the carbon tax but on the 1st of July next year if Mr Rudd is re-elected  the carbon tax will be imposed for the first time on heavy transport. Ok, as things stand it will only cost the  transport sector $100 million or so next year but when the carbon tax under Mr Rudd goes up to $38 a tonne  in 2020 it will cost the heavy transport sector three-quarters of a billion dollars a year and obviously that is  just another slug on everyone’s cost because there is hardly a good in our country that doesn’t at some point  in time get taken around the place in a heavy vehicle.

RAY HADLEY:

Have you been taken aback by the Newspoll today for Dobell and Robertson because it is being reported in  other areas that both your independent polling and polling for the Labor Party would suggest it is not quite  as clear cut as that Newspoll would suggest from last weekend?

TONY ABBOTT:

Ray, I have high hopes of winning both those seats but I am not taking either of them for granted and yes  abolishing the carbon tax is going to help everyone living in Dobell and Robertson, getting the missing link  between the Expressway at Hornsby and the M2 is going to help everyone living in those seats, fully  duplicating the Pacific Highway from Newcastle up to the Queensland border will help many people living  in those seats. So, there are a lot of Coalition policies that are going to help and that is the message I keep  giving to people. We can’t fix every problem but we will avoid making a bad situation worse and we will  certainly get rid of some of the things that this Government has done which have been a gratuitous attack on  your cost of living and on your job security. Look, I think they are both very close calls and my message to  the people of the Central Coast is don’t assume that you can vote Labor and still change the government. If

you want to change the government the only thing you can do is vote for Lucy Wicks in Robertson and  Karen McNamara in Dobell. They are both very good candidates and they deserve your support.

RAY HADLEY:

Ok, now the elephant in the room seeing as you are talking about female candidates. Fiona Scott? I spoke to  her shortly after your alleged gaffe. Now, much has been made and I noticed John McTernan stuck his hoof  into it yesterday or the day before on The Drum about the look on Frances’ face, your daughter. I made the  comment yesterday as the father, like you, of three daughters, it is the sort of look I get about three of four  times a day and it is usually followed up, “you’re so random.” “Oh God you’re so embarrassing.”

TONY ABBOTT:

“Dad, you’re so lame.”

RAY HADLEY:

Lame’s another one. But, it looked to me like you were trying to say she’s a good woman, she’s a very  capable woman and she’s very presentable as well which is something you and I probably said growing up  to a lot of people…

TONY ABBOTT:

Exactly right, Ray.

RAY HADLEY:

… and extended across, but you see generations below us including your daughters and my daughters don’t  approve of you saying that a female has sex appeal or is a good sort or words like that.

TONY ABBOTT:

I think it’s a little different if I may say so Ray. I mean, my kids are always saying that so and so is hot or  words to that effect which I assume means something like you’ve got that appeal.

RAY HADLEY:

No Tony, I’ve got to take you to task here. It would be from Frances and her sisters, “he’s a hottie”.

TONY ABBOTT:

Yep, that’s true. I think they do use a different terminology perhaps but I think they’re just as conscious of  things as their parents are, but I also think that Francie and Bridgie and Lou Lou - were she here - they’re  smart, savvy girls, they’re pretty attuned to the world as it is and I think Francie appreciated that maybe I  was going to unleash some dismay, but look, to be honest Ray I think that the public are over all of this  confected outrage. I think they’re over all this confected outrage. I think they’re over the depredations of the  thought police and look I was a little exuberant. If I had my time again, I would have expressed myself  differently because the thing is…

RAY HADLEY:

But then you’re captive to the thought police that were criticising and you know, I’ve got to just take issue  with you on this because I think it’s very important. I’ve mentioned a number of times on this programme,  last week I interviewed Kevin ‘Bloody’ Wilson, the most politically incorrect Australian on the planet in the

4



former show business who says the most outrageous things about a whole range of people at his shows and I  said even before this Fiona Scott debate, I said you can get into strife and he mentioned that he has a tattoo  on his arm which is a very coarse acronym for what he wants people to do when they don’t agree with him,  but he made a point as a comedian that it has gone too far, that there is too much, that what’s wrong with  saying someone apart from being a capable man or woman is a hot person as the kids would say or a hottie  or a good sort that I might say or has got sex appeal as you said. What’s wrong with that?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, these are very fair points to make, but the thing is that some people for all sorts of reasons do like to, I  guess, take offence or find comments inappropriate and you’re much better off as a Member of Parliament  to...



RAY HADLEY:

I understand you’ve got a broad based appeal.

TONY ABBOTT:

...try to avoid them if you can. If you can avoid them do so and I failed to avoid that particular pitfall the  other day.

RAY HADLEY:

I know you’re not a punter, but she came in from $1.30 to $1.26 on the back of what you said and Mr  Bradbury went from $3 out to $3.50.

TONY ABBOTT:

But I want to assure you Ray and if I may your listeners that there was nothing calculated in what I had to  say. I was asked a question and I gave, as I said, an innocent and exuberant answer.

RAY HADLEY:

Well, it appeared to me you were searching for a politically correct answer and you didn’t find it. So you  resorted back to the language of men our age.

TONY ABBOTT:

And what I should have done is been relentlessly on message Ray and look, the great thing about Fiona  Scott is that she will build a stronger economy so that everyone can get ahead. She’ll scrap the carbon tax,  she’ll get the Budget back under control by ending the waste. She’ll build the infrastructure and the roads of  the 21st century like WestConnex and she’ll vote to stop the boats.

RAY HADLEY:

And she’s a good sort.

TONY ABBOTT:

You can add that. You can add that Ray.

RAY HADLEY:

Well, I haven’t got my daughter looking over my shoulder.

TONY ABBOTT:

But look, the point is, if you want a good local Member and if you want someone who is going to be a  constructive contributor to a strong national government that will actually look after your job security and  will reduce your cost of living, you’ve got to vote for Fiona Scott.

RAY HADLEY:

I spoke about you travelling with Philip Ruddock and the Prime Minister has dragged some other people  into his campaign and I thought it was a really good idea to have Mr Ruddock there because I have great  affection for him and I think everyone in Australia does even though he’s on the other side of politics.

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, Philip’s the father of the House. He’s been around for a long, long time. He was a Minister throughout  the Howard Government era and look, what a wise head to have as your councillor in the difficult and  stressful days of an election campaign.

RAY HADLEY:

But I wanted to pay tribute to your daughters and I mean this quite sincerely. I watched a lot of coverage.  The other night Frances I think was after the - it may have been in Brisbane after you’d been in Penrith. I  know it’s hard to keep up with things, but you were talking to someone on TV. You were doing a walk  through and talking to the punters and there was a young lady with her child to your right and behind you  and a couple of times Frances tapped you on the shoulder and you kept talking to the bloke and she tapped -  as daughters do a little more aggressively to get the attention of their father - and then she whirled you  around and I think you could see her say Dad this is such and such and you need to say hello here. I just  thought that it was a lovely touch by a young woman attuned to the fact that while the bloke needed to be  looked after there’s a young mother and young child here that needed to meet Dad as well. It was a really, it  just typified what sort of young woman she must be.

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, Ray, thank you for that tribute both Francie and Bridgie are very impressive young women but I must  say they are a credit to their mother because I was out tilting at my windmills, as politicians do, but Margie  was doing the heavy lifting. She was doing the hard yards of parenting, she was the one that took them to  their sports, she was the one that went to the parent-teacher nights, she was the one that was there driving  them off to their parties and all the rest of it. So look, they’ve turned out magnificently, they really have, all  of my daughters have turned out magnificently and all credit to their mother.

RAY HADLEY:

Just one final thing, I just happened to catch you in the 10 o’clock news, in a break here and you were  replying to questions about an article appearing today about your member for McMahon, or your candidate  for McMahon, Ray King. I wanted to share this with you from a serving police officer. He sent me this at  about 10:19. Ray King was one of the most dedicated and outstanding New South Wales Police Officers. He  was highly decorated after investigating major cases including homicide and serious crimes. New South  Wales is a much safer place thanks to his hard work. The Sydney Morning Herald reporter should have a  look about this allegation and not print this type of stuff ever again. Perhaps they should have written about  how Ray King was only paid for eight hours a day but he hardly ever took a meal break, would work  numerous additional unpaid hours for the love of the job to solve serious crimes. Ray King, according to this  serving police officer, was an outstanding police officer, would make an outstanding politician.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, that is a very nice tribute and I’m not at all surprised because while I really only know Ray King  through politics, I didn’t know him through his police work. People who have been serving police officers  and are serving police officers speak very, very highly of him and yeah, he went before that Royal  Commission but hundreds of policemen at that time did, the vast majority of them were found to have no  case to answer because it’s very easy to make a complaint, it’s very easy for things to come up in the course  of these investigations and certainly no adverse findings were made about Ray King.

RAY HADLEY:

And to give the reporter credit, that makes it into the article - half way through it and then you’re left asking  the question, well why are we writing it?

TONY ABBOTT:

Why are we writing the thing? That’s exactly right. And one of the reasons it has to be said, Ray, why the  average person is pretty down on the media, particularly the print media, is because we see, time after time,  shock-horror stories like this that turn out to have no basis in fact or no real foundation to them.

RAY HADLEY:

Just one final thing, before you go, I’ve had a number of phone calls on and off air this morning about the  need for you to annunciate costings and an economic statement before the Friday, and I’ve reminded people  that Mr Rudd, on that Friday before the 2007 election announced half of it and left the other half in  abeyance. You keep saying in the last week, I heard you say it again this morning, as you go through this,  will people be left in any doubt before we get to say, the Monday before the election on the Saturday, 7th of  September how you’ll pay for the promises you’re going to make?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well Ray, look, we will tell people exactly what extra we’re going to spend, exactly what extra we’re going  to save so that you’ll be able to work out exactly how much better overall the Budget balance will be under  the Coalition. Now, on the way through, we’re announcing new policies and in the case of the big new  policies, we’re also announcing how we’re going to fund them. So, the two big commitments we’ve  announced so far, the commitment to keep the carbon tax compensation, the tax cuts and the pension and  benefit rises that you got on the 1st of July last year, without a carbon tax and we’ve announced the reduction  in the company tax from 30 per cent to 28.5 per cent. Now, those two commitments cost $17 billion over the  forward estimates and we’ve already announced savings over the forward estimates adding up to $17 billion.  So, there’s no funding hole for the major policies that we have so far announced.

We’re going to be announcing some further major policies and at the time we announce those policies we’ll  also say how we’re going to fund them. Because we’re going to be announcing policies right up into the last  week we can’t give you the final figure until then, but as I said, tax cuts without a carbon tax, we’ve told you  how it’s going to be funded. Company tax cuts, we’ve told you how it’s going to be funded. When we  announce our paid parental leave policy we’ll tell you how it’s going to be funded and look, the Labor Party  keeps hyperventilating about this, as you’d expect them to, but only because they don’t actually have  anything to say for themselves and so basically running this scare campaign against the Opposition’s all  they’ve got left.

RAY HADLEY:

Ok, Alan from Hornsby just makes one point and asked me to make that point to you, these FBT changes  that the government intends to make, they’re gone, are they not under a Coalition?

TONY ABBOTT:

They’re not going to happen under us.

RAY HADLEY:

Ok, that solves it. Thanks for your time.

TONY ABBOTT:

Thank you so much, Ray.
