Labor border policy deception

Temporary Protection Visas are a vital measure in stopping the boats -

along with boat turnbacks and regional processing - a key pillar in halting

the flow of illegal boat arrivals to Australia.

After its disastrous time in government which saw 800 boats bring more

than 50,000 illegal maritime arrivals to Australia, Labor now admits the

Coalition’s Operation Sovereign Borders is effective - it has stopped the

boats.

Mr Shorten says Labor’s policies are the same as the Turnbull Government.

“Our policy is the same as the Government’s.” Rockhampton Press

Conference - 12 May 2016.

His Immigration spokesman Richard Marles says Labor is on a “unity ticket”

with the Government.

“It is fair to say what you said then. It is a unity ticket.” Radio 3AW - 12

March 2016.

These claims are simply not true.

Labor has pledged to abolish Temporary Protection Visas (TPVs).

It opposed and delayed the Coalition’s re-introduction of TPVs.

Mr Shorten cannot attempt to deceive Australians by saying Labor, in

government, will adopt the Coalition’s policies and keep the boats stopped.

Thirty thousand of the 50,000 illegal maritime arrivals under Labor are still

being processed.

Under the Coalition they will be placed on a TPV, or if not owed protection,

returned to their country of origin.

Mr Shorten must explain how Labor will deal with them.

Will Labor automatically hand them the right to permanent residence in

Australia?

It’s time for Mr Shorten to level with the Australian people.

Labor is not on a unity ticket to keep the boats stopped - as Ms Plibersek

has highlighted on several occasions.

“Absolutely not. All of these candidates have said that they support

Labor Party policy. What they don't like is Liberal Party policy.” Brisbane

Doorstop Interview, 16 May 2016

The boats will start again under a Labor Government - it’s the same old

Labor.
