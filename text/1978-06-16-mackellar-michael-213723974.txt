REFUGEES DESERVE UNDERSTANDING

The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, the HoneMeJcR<>

MacKellar, today called upon Australians to uphold their traditional

tolerance towards refugees.

In honouring its international obligations, the Australian Government

had steered a course which balanced compassion with responsibility to the

Australian community, he saidÂ®

Addressing the Second Baltic Convention at its official opening in

Adelaide, Mr MacEellar said: "You, above all groups in Australia, will

know the plight of refugees and will share the Government*s concern to

provide sanctuary in Australia for those who are genuine refugees, processed

in an orderly way and within the limits of our capacity to successfully

integrate them into the Australian communityÂ®

"Among Australians today are around 400,000 people who came here as

displaced personsÂ® By and large, they were made welcome* Today we are

showing the same concern for people from Indo—China, although fewer than

10,000 of them have so far arrived here as refugeesÂ®

"While the flow continues, Australia will play its partÂ® But Australia

alone cannot solve what is becoming a problem of world—wide significance.

"We shall endeavour to involve other countries in this major resettlement

program, while taking -our fair share of refugeesÂ®

"But in the end a just solution must be found in the countries from

which the refugees are comingÂ®"
