HOWARD ON EAST TIMOR

Â

Prime Minister Howard’s statement last night that he strongly prefers 
East Timor to remain part of Indonesia sends a very disturbing sign al 
to the pro-integrationist militias which are wreaking terror and havoc”, 
the Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs, Laurie Brereton, said today.

Â

“Stubborn and blind to East Timorese aspirations, 
Mr Howard is being left behind by the pace of events. Instead of looking 
forward to the increasingly likely outcome of an independent East Timor, 
Mr Howard appears determined to look to the past.”

Â

“Whether intentionally or not, Mr Howard’s confirmation 
that the full weight of Australian diplomacy is being marshalled to 
support East Timor’s continued incorporation within Indonesia can 
only give encouragement to the para-military thugs who are seeking to 
block East Timorese self-determination. They will take heart both from 
what Mr Howard said, and from what he chose not to say."

Â

“The Prime Minister made no mention of his Government’s 
supposed commitment to support East Timorese self-determination. He 
said nothing in support of a free and fair vote as the only internationally 
acceptable means for the East Timorese people to determine their own 
future. Mr Howard made no commitment to back East Timor in the likely 
event that the East Timorese people choose independence. All his emphasis 
was on his preference for East Timor to remain part of Indonesia.”

Â

“Nor could Mr Howard bring himself to give in principle 
support for the establishment of a United Nations monitoring presence 
in East Timor. Such a UN force is essential to ensure that the East 
Timorese people are able to decide their future free from fear and intimidation, 
but Mr Howard says every avenue to implement an autonomy package must 
be ‘exhausted ...   before  we start examining what are still hypothetical propositions.”

Â

“With daily reports of rising violence by pro-integrationist 
forces, the Howard Government should give a clear in principle commitment 
for Australian participation in a United Nations monitoring force.”

Â

“An early commitment to support a UN monitoring 
force in East Timor would allow Australia to be involved in the planning 
of such an exercise from the beginning. Such a commitment would send 
a very clear message that Australia is totally opposed to the pro-integrationists’ 
efforts to thwart self-determination.”

Â

“Mr Howard’s statement last night made a mockery 
of his Government’s self-proclaimed ‘historic’ policy shift on 
East Timor. It sends all the wrong signals. There is clearly very little 
chance the Howard Government will demonstrate any real leadership on 
this issue.”
