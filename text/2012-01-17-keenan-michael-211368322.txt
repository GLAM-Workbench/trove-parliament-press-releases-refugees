Topics: Labor’s Border Protection Crisis / Recent Boat Arrivals

Howard Sattler

Now we will hear from Michael Keenan, the spokesperson for Justice, Customs and Border Protection,  because guess what another boat has been intercepted. Now we can get blasÃÂ© about this and say lets  stop reporting these things, like road crashes, but they don’t go away and this wont go away either. Hi  Michael.

Michael Keenan

Hi Howard, how are you?

Howard Sattler

Just another 74, should we be worried about this?

Michael Keenan

Of course we should be and you’re right we shouldn’t be blasÃÂ© about it. Every illegal boat arrival that  comes into our waters should be deep cause for concern.

Howard Sattler

It’s hardly news anymore that’s the thing, that’s the point I’m trying to make.

Michael Keenan

Well it was when we were in Government because we had about 3 boat arrivals per year so it wasn’t  this regular when we were in Government, but unfortunately under the Labor Government that is just a  week’s work for them. But we should remain concerned about it because it is deeply concerning  because every one that comes through is sent down here by very sophisticated criminals

and of course every one that comes through takes a great risk with their personal safety and that is not  something that we should ever want to encourage.

Howard Sattler

Well the Labor party does hope that it goes away. It should be an election issue but is there a risk that  it will go off the radar by the time we go to the polls next time round?

Michael Keenan

I’m not sure about that. What I know is that we are going to continue to see boats coming unless there  is a change of policy. But my gut feeling is that people are very concerned about it, because people  expect the Commonwealth to protect our borders, I mean that’s absolutely core business to what the  Australian Government is meant to do and they do expect that from their Government. I think people  are a little bit surprised about how bad things have got under the Labor Party considering the problem

was solved when the Government changed in 2007.

Howard Sattler

But their retort is your side, the Liberal side, could fix this by just agreeing to Malaysia.

Michael Keenan

Well I just don’t accept that. Malaysia is a very limited option. It only involves the swapping of 800  people for 4000. 800 people currently arrive every month under this Government, so the idea that this  Malaysian arrangement was going to stop people smuggling is just a ludicrous proposition. We know  what will stop people smuggling because we have done it before and there is a whole sweep of  policies that need to be embraced and that’s what we are trying to convince the Labor party to do.

Howard Sattler

Ok I haven’t caught up with how many people are on Christmas Island at the moment but another 74 is  that going to put any pressure on the facility over there?

Michael Keenan

It is already above capacity and when we saw this sort of overcrowding last time of course was when  we saw the riots and the place was burnt down by the detainees inside it and the Commonwealth  actually lost control of that facility and the Australian Federal Police had to retake it by force. So we are  very concerned that we are seeing a repeat of those conditions and that every new boat arrival and the

extra people going into that facility are going to make it harder and harder to maintain order there.

Howard Sattler

One thing I think really should concern people are the safety of those aboard, think what you want  about the way they get here but nobody wants anyone to get hurt or die, the monsoon season doesn’t  seem to be stopping them anymore, this is the period when there usually is a natural lull because of  weather conditions but that’s not happening.

Michael Keenan

You can imagine what we might see when the weather conditions do become better up there but look  we are a little bit surprised I mean clearly people smugglers are still very active and are sending boats  down even in the weather we are having at the moment. It doesn’t bode well for what might happen  when things clear up a bit.

Howard Sattler

I can tell you, because I got it firsthand from someone who does some work up in Indonesia, how  many boats were we told sunk last year, 1 or 2 or 3, what was it?

Michael Keenan

Well it’s what we know of. There was one very serious incident, that boat that sunk off Java, but there  are all the ones we don’t hear of. There are all the boats that left Indonesia that are just never seen or  heard of.

Howard Sattler

If I told you it was 12 what would you say?

Michael Keenan

It is impossible for me to verify that Howard and it would be impossible for anyone to because there is

We certainly know that from what we do know, let alone of course the boats that have almost inevitably  disappeared and can’t be accounted for.

Howard Sattler

How can you keep the electorates interest in this?

Michael Keenan

It’s not up to me to do that. I think people will remain concerned about it because they do expect the  Government to control who comes into Australia. At the moment we have had almost 15000 people  who have arrived in Australia courtesy of criminal gangs and I don’t think many Australians think that is  acceptable.

Howard Sattler

15000 multiplied by $5000 a head its good business isn’t it?

Michael Keenan

That would be minimum so you are talking about millions and millions of dollars and they are very  sophisticated criminal networks. That is why they are not just going to give up their profits because  Australia was going to send 800 people to Malaysia. They can easily send those people down here  and say well if you do get picked up and sent to Malaysia then we are happy to give you a two for

one offer. These are very sophisticated criminals and they have shown enormous resilience and  whenever they have tested the Labor party of course it’s the Labor party that has crumbled. So they  think that they can keep doing it and there is unfortunately no evidence that this will change at the  moment.

Howard Sattler

Thank you Michael.

Michael Keenan

Happy to talk to you Howard.
