ADAM SHAND:

Now, to WA’s own, good aÃ¢ÂÂÃ®Â´Âernoon ChrisÃ¢ÂÂÃ§ÂÂan.

MINISTER PORTER:

Adam how areyou?

ADAM SHAND:

Very well thanks. How’d you go with the Budget? Did you get what you wanted? For your porÃ¢ÂÂÃ®ÂÂ olio? MINISTER PORTER:

Well mine is a challenging porÃ¢ÂÂÃ®ÂÂ olio Adam, I’ve got thirtyÃ¢ÂÂfive per cent of the Commonwealth budget and it’s a growing  thirtyÃ¢ÂÂfive per cent so part of the task I’ve got is to try and restrain that expenditure growth and focus on trying to give it  to the people who need it the most. We banked a lot of savings which we’re puÃ¢ÂÂÃ¯Â¿Â½ng into an account to pay for the NDIS  when it comes into full scheme in 2019Ã¢ÂÂ20 so I think that’s a very good iniÃ¢ÂÂÃ§ÂÂaÃ¢ÂÂÃ§ÂÂve. Just over $2billion dollars is being saved  from other areas, including closing the carbon tax, being placed in this account to make sure that the most vulnerable  and needy Australians are going to be looked aÃ¢ÂÂÃ®Â´Âer.

ADAM SHAND:

What about thehomeless?

MINISTER PORTER:

Well I mean a great deal of money is spent in the area of homelessness so there’s…

ADAM SHAND:

No extra money though.

MINISTER PORTER:

Well that’s not enÃ¢ÂÂÃ§ÂÂrely correct. So with some of the money that will be spent in the domesÃ¢ÂÂÃ§ÂÂc violence area there’s a  parÃ¢ÂÂÃ§ÂÂcular focus on housing and homelessness at the flash points of domesÃ¢ÂÂÃ§ÂÂc violence and it’s also the case that previous  money that we renewed outside the Budget cycle for the naÃ¢ÂÂÃ§ÂÂonal partnership on homelessness again has a focus on  that area of…

ADAM SHAND:

I’m just looking at your press release and there’s not a menÃ¢ÂÂÃ§ÂÂon of the homeless there at all and not only are you not  commiÃ¢ÂÂÃ¯Â¿Â½ng extra funds specifically to the homeless you’re not indexing the money that you’re already commiÃ¢ÂÂÃ¯Â¿Â½ng. So  you’re going backwards at a Ã¢ÂÂÃ§ÂÂme when homelessness is increasing.

MINISTER PORTER:

Well Adam that assumes that the only funds are the funds that aren’t being indexed…

ADAM SHAND:

There’s nothing in the press release ChrisÃ¢ÂÂÃ§ÂÂan I’m just going on what you told us.

MINISTER PORTER:

Well there’s more going on than simply the press release. The Budget is a very large document and Adam I’ve noted to  you this Government is the Government that renewed the naÃ¢ÂÂÃ§ÂÂonal partnership in this area with the States, including  WA, something the previous Government failed to do. That represents hundreds of billions of dollars of investment.  What we have done with that money is require that it is expended in a way so there’s a potenÃ¢ÂÂÃ§ÂÂal of focus on

homelessness issues for vicÃ¢ÂÂÃ§ÂÂms of domesÃ¢ÂÂÃ§ÂÂc violence. So it’s not enÃ¢ÂÂÃ§ÂÂrely correct I must say, so next Ã¢ÂÂÃ§ÂÂme when you say  there’s nothing…

ADAM SHAND:

Well it’s your press release you see and I would have thought you’d be so… it starts off saying that you’re commiÃ¢ÂÂÃ¡ÂÂed to  providing a strong, (inaudible) for Australia’s most vulnerable. There are no more people more vulnerable than the

homeless and they’re not menÃ¢ÂÂÃ§ÂÂoned in this Budget. Next Ã¢ÂÂÃ§ÂÂme you’re in Perth ChrisÃ¢ÂÂÃ§ÂÂan, let’s go for a walk around Perth  and look at the number of people who are sleeping on the streets every night. Are we doing well enough?

MINISTER PORTER:

Well it’s a shared responsibility between the States and the Commonwealth, but what you’re pu Ã¢ÂÂÃ¯Â¿Â½ng to me is that  there’s not appropriate levels of funding and we do fund it considering, quite extensively. I don’t need to, with much  respect Adam, do a tour with you, and I’m well aware of the issue…

ADAM SHAND:

Well let’s do it then. If we’re doing dinner let’s…

MINISTER PORTER:

It’s my town, but it is a very difficult problem but what we have done is renewed money that the previous Government  failed to renew and we’ve put a focus on vicÃ¢ÂÂÃ§ÂÂms of domesÃ¢ÂÂÃ§ÂÂc violence. I think that’s a very good iniÃ¢ÂÂÃ§ÂÂaÃ¢ÂÂÃ§ÂÂve.

ADAM SHAND:

You’re also making a crackdown on welfare generally, how much can we expect to see there?

MINISTER PORTER:

Well in this parÃ¢ÂÂÃ§ÂÂcular Budget we say there are savings to be guarded in the order of about sixtyÃ¢ÂÂfive million dollars by  running ninety thousand reviews of people on the Disability Support Pension. So when we inherited government there  were 830 thousand Australians or one in 20 Australians of working age were collecÃ¢ÂÂÃ§ÂÂng the Disability Support Pension. It’s  a selfÃ¢ÂÂevidently higher number we looked through those people and we were trying to idenÃ¢ÂÂÃ§ÂÂfy, parÃ¢ÂÂÃ§ÂÂcularly in the under  35 age range where people have a capacity or be it limited capacity to work try and help them back into the workforce  because it seems to get payment like the DSP is appropriate for some people who have actually no capacity to work. But  it’s not a very good outcome for people can engage in the workforce. If they can, they should. It’s beÃ¢ÂÂÃ¡ÂÂer for them,  certainly beÃ¢ÂÂÃ¡ÂÂer for the tax payer, but it means that a far more interesÃ¢ÂÂÃ§ÂÂng and involved and producÃ¢ÂÂÃ§ÂÂve life makes people,  ulÃ¢ÂÂÃ§ÂÂmately much happier Ã¢ÂÂ so that is if they’re engaged in the workforce.

ADAM SHAND:

I agree, I agree, now one of the, we’re talking a liÃ¢ÂÂÃ¡ÂÂle about the ingredients towards radicalisaÃ¢ÂÂÃ§ÂÂon of youth in this country  and you have made an addiÃ¢ÂÂÃ§ÂÂonal investment of nearly $11million on building social cohesion for recently arrived  migrants. I think there is a view out there amongst the migrants taken, parÃ¢ÂÂÃ§ÂÂcularly the refugees and so forth that we  are imporÃ¢ÂÂÃ§ÂÂng terrorism in our society. How do we address that through greater social cohesion?

MINISTER PORTER:

Well that money comes on top of a very large amount of money that spent in reseÃ¢ÂÂÃ¡ÂÂlement services which I’m responsible  for and that’s in the vicinity of a sixÃ¢ÂÂhundred million in total and we are trying to have as much focus as we can, firstly on  employment pathways which make for beÃ¢ÂÂÃ¡ÂÂer, happier newly arrived students. But also specifically programmes to target  younger people and try and buÃ¢ÂÂÃ¡ÂÂress them against radicalisaÃ¢ÂÂÃ§ÂÂon. If I might say so, with respect to your summary  comment, that the first and foremost protecÃ¢ÂÂÃ§ÂÂon for all Australians is the very, very stringent applicaÃ¢ÂÂÃ§ÂÂon processes that  we run offshore which use things as an indicator. There’s biometric checks, we look into everyone’s prior history, right  down to things like health but also all of their prior acÃ¢ÂÂÃ§ÂÂviÃ¢ÂÂÃ§ÂÂes and what I can say is that we have the most stringent system  in the world in terms of veÃ¢ÂÂÃ¯Â¿Â½ng people who come to Australia under the humanitarian and refugee stream. That’s about  thirteen thousand, seven hundred and fiÃ¢ÂÂÃ®Â´Ây a year generally plus the twelve thousand addiÃ¢ÂÂÃ§ÂÂonal people who are  displaced and can’t return to their homes because of the conflict in Syria.

ADAM SHAND:

Now I will extend that invitaÃ¢ÂÂÃ§ÂÂon to you to walk around Perth here and see the homelessness issue and I know this is  your hometown but there are a lot of people every night who have no home and I think that is to be our focus and I  think a lot of people are saying why are we spending money on Syrian refugees when there are people in our streets

every night with nowhere to go. Surely prioriÃ¢ÂÂÃ§ÂÂes have to be right.

MINISTER PORTER:

Well you know the people that I’ve met who’ve arrived from Syria, for instance a family that I met recently who were a  ChrisÃ¢ÂÂÃ§ÂÂan family who have been in refugee camps for a long Ã¢ÂÂÃ§ÂÂme, yes they are homeless and I guess in that sense there’s  a comparison to people who are homeless in Australia. But the reality is that, that ChrisÃ¢ÂÂÃ§ÂÂan family of Syria had they  aÃ¢ÂÂÃ¡ÂÂempted to return to their home they may well have been killed. So I think that there are differences.

ADAM SHAND:

People die on the streets every day you know very regularly, here in Perth as well and I think what I would seek for the  audience is that people want to see that problem addressed before we bring other problems into our own country.

MINISTER PORTER:

Well I must say I can’t agree that you have to choose between one or the other…

ADAM SHAND:

No it’s prioriÃ¢ÂÂÃ§ÂÂes.

MINISTER PORTER:

Well the reality is that we are a generous naÃ¢ÂÂÃ§ÂÂon in terms of the way in which we bring in humanitarian refugees and  displaced people into Australia. By internaÃ¢ÂÂÃ§ÂÂonal comparisons we’re very generous and we can afford to be generous in  my observaÃ¢ÂÂÃ§ÂÂons. It’s not that much, probably about right. The numbers that we take in are about right for Australia.  It’s not an indicaÃ¢ÂÂÃ§ÂÂve business. It’s part of our internaÃ¢ÂÂÃ§ÂÂonal obligaÃ¢ÂÂÃ§ÂÂon as good ciÃ¢ÂÂÃ§ÂÂzens of the world and humane people

and generous people. But I don’t accept that it’s a choice between one or the other I think that’s a very, very…

ADAM SHAND:

It’s not a choice I’m saying it’s a sense of prioriÃ¢ÂÂÃ§ÂÂes that’s why I’m not saying one over the other, I’m saying let’s do both.

Let’s get the balance right okay?

MINISTER PORTER:

What you’re saying Adam is we should bring in less people from humanitarian and refugee inputs and transfer the  money directly to homelessness.

ADAM SHAND:

I’m saying charity begins at home.

MINISTER PORTER:

Well I think that we’ve got the balance about right. I mean your suggesÃ¢ÂÂÃ§ÂÂng a difference balance which is suggesÃ¢ÂÂÃ§ÂÂng our  humanitarian, refugee intake should come down then I guess that’s something that…

ADAM SHAND:

I’m saying let’s walk on the streets of Perth, your hometown and you tell me whether you’re happy with the situaÃ¢ÂÂÃ§ÂÂon  going on. We’re going to leave it there, thank you for your Ã¢ÂÂÃ§ÂÂme.

MINISTER PORTER:

Yeah thanks Adam,cheers.

ADAM SHAND:

That’s ChrisÃ¢ÂÂÃ§ÂÂan Porter, Social Services Minister and I think that there’s absolutely nothing in the Budget…
