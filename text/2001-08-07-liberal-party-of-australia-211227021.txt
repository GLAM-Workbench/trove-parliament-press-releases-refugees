Australia Meeting its Humanitarian Obligations

MPS 111/2001

The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock, said today that Australia's offshore refugee and humanitarian intake over the past 12 months demonstrated Australia's continuing commitment to helping those most in need.

Australia is playing a leading role in resettling people languishing in harsh conditions in refugee camps in Africa and the Middle East, as well as from the states of the former Yugoslavia. In the offshore program in 2000-2001, Australia resettled 7,992 people, out of a total Refugee and Humanitarian Program of 13,733 places.

"The fact that many of those resettled under the Refugee and Humanitarian program were people of Middle Eastern origin is proof that people overseas can gain access to Australia's resettlement program," Mr Ruddock said.

"However, Australia's ability to take the most urgent cases is threatened by the continued influx of people who arrive in the country illegally or make asylum claims after arriving lawfully."

A total of 5,577 places went to people granted temporary or permanent protection visas onshore and 164 people were granted temporary humanitarian stay visas.

Of the protection visas granted in Australia, 4,452 people were granted Temporary Protection Visas (TPV) after by-passing the normal resettlement processes offshore and arriving in Australia without proper authority.

"For every person brought to Australia by people smugglers, and who is granted protection, there is one less place available to resettle someone in arguably greater need," Mr Ruddock said.

"Many of those arriving illegally, often from the relative safety and comfort of a third country, have had the money and freedom to travel, as demonstrated by the fact that about $640,000 is currently held in trust for detainees.

"Australia has the second most generous per capita refugee and humanitarian resettlement program in the world, behind Canada, but this position is under increasing threat by people smugglers," Mr Ruddock said.

The main areas of priority for resettlement in the offshore component of the Humanitarian Program continued to be Africa, the Middle East and the former Yugoslavia. Many of the people who had been resettled in Australia in 2000-01 originated in Afghanistan, Iraq and Iran. Others came from Sierra Leone and Sudan, Bosnia and Kosovo. Those resettled included 402 places filled by the Women at Risk category.

The humanitarian places in the current program year, 2001-02, remained at 12,000 new places, with another 1,638 places available due to a 'rollover' of unallocated places from the previous year and a number of places freed up by the departure of TPV holders.

"Globally, there are some 22.3 million refugees and people of concern to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Australia cannot take them all, but we can help those most in need, by offering resettlement places.

"It is very important that we be able to share the burden of those countries of first asylum, where hundreds of thousands of refugees languish in appalling conditions.

"The extent to which this is possible will be dependent on our ability to limit the scope of people smugglers bringing to Australia those who can pay," Mr Ruddock said.
