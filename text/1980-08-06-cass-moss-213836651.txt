A recent conversation in an aircraft, an illustration  of too long persisting prejudices in the Australian community:

August 6, 1980

C H A U V I N I S T ?  S E X I S T ?   ÃÂ ÃÂ  P R O U D  O F  IT!

Ansett flight 394 from Melbourne to Canberra on  Thursday 24 July. Soon after take-off* the Captain as usual  announced to passengers, the flight details.

Given that the passengers had no say whatsoever  in determining the "itinerary", they continued looking out of  the windows, feeding their babies and/or sipping their own drinks  peacefully. In conclusion the Captain made the following  .  announcement (as most Captains on most airlines do):  "On behalf

of the crew and the girls I wish you a comfortable flight to  Canberra."

Having finished the percolated coffee served with lemon , (heaven  knows why), my assistant mustered some courage and asked one  of the stewardesses a couple of questions:

"Excuse me madam," says he, "what does the Captain mean by  *The Girls'? Why doesn't he call the men 'The Boys'? I thought  you were also part of the 'crew'. Besides, couldn't he call  you -- if he must -'the stewardesses',or 'the cabin crew'? 'The  Girls'-isn't that somewhat of a sexist statement?"v

She sat there in an empty seat for a short time, speechless, Ã¢ÂÂ

then said, "I never thought of it that way. Yes. You know j

what I'll do? I'll go and ask the Captain." She went j

on her way collecting a few more of the empty cups with the Ã¢ÂÂ

napkins stuffed into them. !

My assistant said that he had a good chance to have a look at Â·

all the stewardesses on that flight.  None of them seemed to him  "girls". As he put it, "they were all somewhere between age  twenty four and death."

Some five minutes passed and hnr.k r.omes the "girl". One could  see from her face that, she was somewhat upset. Then,  whispering,  she to.Id him that "The Captain told me to tell you that.yes, he  is a male chauvinist and a sexist and he :1s proud of it".

It seems there is not much more sensitivity towards women since the  days when Reg Ansett dismissed his stewardesses as 'old boilers'!

I N F O R M I N G  T H E   I N F O R M E R S I'm repeatedly told that the Department of Immigration is ,   extremely efficient in informing people both in Australia and

overseas about their rights, duties, privileges and the services  available. In fact, hundreds of thousands of dollars are spent  yearly by the Department on "information".

What has the Department got to say about the following letter?

"This letter is to advise you that I today received my  British passport from you safely in spite of the fact that  it was not sent by registered mail. Perhaps you do not  regard a British passport as a very important document, or  you just have great faith in the British Postal Service.

I also wish to record my annoyance that despite having to  make a trip to Edinburgh, to fill in the necessary document  and having paid the sum of 15 pounds Stirling ($30) I still  have only been granted a Temporary Visa to enable me to

return to Australia. My British Passport even lists my  residence as Australia. I

I did not even know that a visa was necessary on a British  Passport until I went through Immigration at Sydney Airport  on my way to board the plane, or I would certainly have  arranged these details before departure.

After being involved in extra worry, travel and expense,  perhaps you could explain to me why only a temporary visa has been granted.

Yours faithfully,

When h f leaves P m  in charge.

NO CONTACT WITH THE   PUBLIC

I N C R E A S E D  C H A R G E S   BY .TELECOM'

B I G O T S  OR  P A T R I O T S ?

The Minister for Industry and Commerce informs me that  "NONE" of the public servants in his department are bi-lingual  or multi-lingual. He added also that 1  the staff of my  Department, because of the nature of its functions, do not have  across-the-counter or other close contact with the general public."

My dear Minister, are you seriously suggesting no-one of non-  English speaking background and feeling less than fluent in  English is engaged in Industry or Commerce in Australia? Does  this confirm the view that immigrants of non-English speaking '   background have been brought to this country mainly as 'factory  fodder" and in the last 20-30 years so few of them have advanced  from being wage slaves to be managers or owners of industry or  commerce as to be insignificant from a communication point of  view?

On Monday 28 July 1980, Telecom Australia announced an increase in charges for certain services. The increased charges will apply from 1 September 1980. They include:

20% increase in fees for the installation and removal of  miscellaneous items of telephone equipment, private manual  switchboards, extension alarms and portable sockets;

* 20% increase in the rental of miscellaneous items of telephone  equipment including leased coin telephones;

* 20% increase in installation and removal fees for some type  of teleprinter equipment;

* an increase of 100% (from 40 to 80 cents) in fees for the supply of detailed statements of operation connected calls  and/or telegrams from a telephone service; ,

* an increase from 60 to 70 cents in fees for booking a telephone trunk call with an operator1  when the call could  have been dialed by S.T.D.; '

* an increase from $2 to $2.50 for diverting telephone calls  to another number.

We are frequently asked why it is that we are not more "outspoken"  and .  "radical" in issues regarding the social, economic and  political rights of the ethnic communities. I don’t want to  bore you with Party correspondence but the following is one of

a string of letters we received following the launching of our  policy on immigration and ethnic affairs: .

4.

"Sir,

I have read with disgust your Party's intentions reference  Immigration.

You would destroy the British and white origins of my beloved  Australia.

You would deny all our fine and honourable traditions, and these -  by sully the honour of all those who fought and died for, and,  in the belief of all those fine ideals that are Australian.

... Understand and heed what I write, the law is equally applicable  to a Politician, as to a Plebian, and I refer to those covering  treason.

... So you and your Party take a one way trip to Russia and  come out in the open and take up their citizenship. You are  no Australian."

This is the reaction to our honest attempt to achieve equal  rights for all Australian residents. Indeed, we want to allow  everyone to become an Australian citizen. I don't believe that  speaking or not sneaking the language will make the person a

better or worse citizen.

Here is another one: .

"Dear Sir,

... Australia has always been and still is a British country. It's people, it's heritage, it's institutions, it's language  and background are British and I am thankful. After the Second  War, Australia for the first time in its history admitted non-

British people in large numbers who were damned glad to be  allowed may I emphasise, to come here. '

... I don't deny that non-British people have helped enrich our .   country but they've no right at all to now want to make ‘

Australia multi-racial, multi-cultural or multi-something else.

Further it is my observation in my daily work or leisure hours  that Old Australians are so enraged at the establishment and  media pressure campaign to force them to fit the foreigner  image in Australia rather than making the foreigners fit the

Australians that they, the Aussies are more determined than  ever to "knock the rough-edges off the foreigners." I know this  is nowÂ· my policy." .  I

I would be truly interested in what you think or indeed, what  your reply to these people would be! "

A su r v e y conducted in 1977 by the Department of Veterans  Affairs estimated that some 30% of the 7,236 employees in the  Department's general and auxiliary hospitals were born overseas  or born in Australia of parents born overseas.

However, according to the Minister, "The Department has not found  it necessary to specifically employ bi-lingual or multi-lingual  staff in public contact areas." Mr Aderman says that "The  predominant areas of migrant contact are the Department's  Artificial Limb and Appliance Centres (R.A.L.A.C.'s), and

general hospitals in each State. Broad surveys undertaken in  1977 indicated that the migrant proportion of R.A.L.A.C. patients  was approximately 9.0%, but the majority of these were from  English speaking countries. In the general hospitals, it was

estimated that migrants were about 15% of the total number  of inpatients. It has been found in practice that in most  instances there is a staff member available who can give assistant  in translation when required."

I would like to ask the Minister whether the "staff member(s)  available who 'can give assistance" with translating are "catering1   "cleaning" or "professional" staff2 How would an unqualified  interpreter who is unfamiliar with the specific terminology

explain to a patient that he is suffering from OsteochondrodysÂ­ trophy or some other hair-raising disease or even more mundane  but perhaps life threatening disease in a sensitive, humane  supporting fashion?

According to tho A.B.S. publication "The Labor Force, Australia",   April 1980, the unemployment rate amongst overseas born  (excluding those born in Italy) is much higher than the Australian born.  Here are the figures: % ÃÂ 0 0

An Australian Advertising Industry Council survey thisyear asked  the following question: "The advertising and discussion of  politics on radio and television must stop three days before  every election. This does not apply to newspapers.  Do you agree  or disagree with these restrictions on radio and television?

The results of the survey published in June, show the answers  to this question to be: 34.9% Agree; 52.3% Disagree; 12.8% Unsure.

Therefore, the survey concludes, "the existing regulations  relating to political matters on the eve of elections does not  have majority support."

The same survey also asked "Which of the following are. most in  need of attention or change?" The replies indicate that there  is a need for urgent change in the following areas: The Government, 42%; Trade Unions, 35%; Education, 33%; Politicians

31%; The Public Service, 19%; and Television, 18%.

A S S O C I A T E D  We have heard the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs pr-i a t t w c c  Mr MacPhee repeatedly say that some 52% of all immigrants

IxLLn I  1 VLv arriving in Australia-under NUMAS had relatives or friends in this country.

Apparently the Minister's statements are based on the following  "statistics":

motor cars.  Is this a case of "not even those who could, can  afford them"?

The same issue also invites tenders for: dressed poultry, peanut paste for the Army, roller shutter doors for Tonga,  and belts and buzzers. If you are interested don't hesitate  to enquire from1 1  the Supply Branch all States or the Official

Secretary, London and Australian Embassy, Washington1 !

Did you know that nearly 30,000 people are admitted in '   Australia each year without having to comply with the normal  immigration requirements? These "temporary residents" are the  "true migrants".

9.

They move from place to place, from country to country In  search of better paid or more rewarding jobs. There Is an  International market for their expertise.

The Department believes that "...the temporary resident will  be engaging In some form of activity .. and most will be underÂ­ taking some form of employment Involving an expertise not normall;  available in Australia."

Visas are Issued for these people for an initial period of  12 months,.but these are normally renewable for up to 5 years.  Furthermore, the Department of Immigration points out that  "...opportunity exist for them to be granted permament resident  status." In fact, in the year ended 30 June 1979, some 6,000  people were approved for change of status. Why this double

standard? Are these people "better" than others

"Hi there! A short political message while selected under N .U .M.A .  S . ?  you’re waiting fo r the walk sign.” . There are no prizes for guessing the countries of origin of these  "temporary migrants". They are mainly from the USA, Great

.  Britain, Japan,^Canada and Germany.

According to the 1978-^79 Annual Report of the Department of  Immigration, the following number in the main occupational  categories were admitted to Australia:

Staff for Aust. Branches of overseas orgs. 7521

Staff for educational research and similar orgs. 2017  Entertainers 2210

Sportsmen and women 3134

Professional specialists 4106

Technical staff 2686

Working holiday makers 4215

Other specialist categories 4078

Is the Minister absolutely sure that there are no "suitable"  Australians to fill these positions?

U N E M P L O Y E D  During 1978-79 an estimated 570,800 males and 452,000 females were unemployed for at least one week.

Their mean annual incomes in 1978-79 were $5,720 and $3,240  respectively.

Some 41% of the males and 64% of the females did not receive  any unemployment benefits.

Cows are so stupid!

In the financial year 1977-78 Australians  spent some $6,778,000,000 on medical services, dental services,  pharmaceuticals, hospitals, nursing homes, and other facilities.  Of that, $2,718,000,000 was paid for by private individuals  .  and $4,060,000,000 by the State and Federal Governments.

According to the Australian Association of National Advertisers'  Newsletter "Interface", figures released by the Australian  Broadcasting Tribunal indicate that commercial television  stations have made a profit of more than $46 million in 1978-79.  The 15 metropolitan stations made a net profit of $34.6 million

and the 35 country stations $12.1 million, (after paying tax  and licence fees).

Total revenue for the metropolitan commercial TV stations was  $332.6 million and for the country stations, $75 million. The  total expenditure was $172 million.

The 30 metropolitan commercial radio stations in 1978-79 made  a net profit of $6.5 million. The 98 country commercial stations  also showed a profit of $4.7 million (after tax and licence  fees were paid).  Five city and fifteen country stations reported  a loss for the year.

Total revenue for the metropolitan broadcasters was $77.1 million  while the country revenue was $48.5 million.

It's incredible that we are prepared to pay so much money to  be told by others what is good for us.

C O M P E T I T I O N

O L D  A G E  I N S U R A N C E   (PENSIONS):  G R E E C E

T H E  A N S W E R We had a few answers to last month's competition but  unfortunately none of them correct. The correct answer should have been: The name of the people who, previous to

historical record, descended‘from the Appemines and, advancing  from Carseoli & Reate into the plain drove out the Siculi -  that is, the primeval Romans or the ancestors of the Romans  is the' .  "Aborigines"(ab-origo).

T H E  Q U E S T I O N What is the meaning of the word "AMAZON". Where did it  originate? What is the history of it?

: V-

Ã¢ÂÂ  r 7 :

Greece, unlike Australia, has a "contributory" type of pension.  That is, an individual has to make a certain number of  contributions before he/she is eligible for a pension.

Difficulties arise when someone, after having contributed in Greece (Italy or other countries) for say 10 years, decides to come to Australia. Unfortunately, that person loses his/her right to a pension from the country of origin (and

the. contributions paid) and becomes Â· .  eligible for the Australian pension only after 10 years permanent residence in Australia.

Ã¢ÂÂ   Whilst this may seem fair from the point of view of either  country, it is clearly unfair to the individual. Some  international arrangement is necessary to enable people to  Ã¢ÂÂ transfer their pension rights from one country to another.

12.

j;*Â·

. In 1979 there were 99 pensions paid in Australia by the

.  Greek government totalling an amount of 5,513,245 drs .

(or $A110,265). .

The pensionable age in Greece is 65 for men and 60 for womeri,  but pensions can be paid from the age of 58 (for both men and  women) after 10,500 days of insurance contributions. The  minimum contributions to be eligible for a pension is 4050

insured days. '

The old age pension consists of the basic pension, plus an  additional allowance according toÂ· the number of insured working  days. The basic pension is equivalent to between 30 and 70%  of the recipient's average wage during the last two years of

insurance. The additional allowance comes to between 1 and  2.5% of the wages for the last two years of insurance.

'  The pension amounts are subject to the following increases:

Â· >  Â·  Spouses:  450 Drachmae ($A1 approx.= 50 drs.) per month if she

Ã¢ÂÂ¢  \ is neither employed nor receiving a pension.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢  Children: first child, 20%; second child, 15% and third child

10% of the basic pension.

A pensioner may engage in a gainful activity and continue to  draw his pension provided that his monthly wage is less than  35 times the basic wage of an unskilled worker.

Under the portability provisions the Australian Government  in 1979 was paying 3081 pensions in Greece (to ex-Australian  residents). At an average rate of approximately $A2,500 per  year, the amount paid in Greece is somewhere in the vicinity  of $A7,702,500 (or 385,125,000 drs).

W H O  W I L L  PAY FOR

T H I S ?  The Minister for Health has announced that from 1 November 1980

.  medical fees on which medical benefits are based will increase by some 9.6%. Specifically the increases are as follows:

Pathology services, 9.8%; Radiology and radio therapy services,  9.7%; G.P. attendances, 9.5%; Consultant physician services,  9.5%; Specialist surgeon services, 9.5%; other services, 9.4%.

So what's new? We are quite accustomed to the fact that the  Government is constantly condoning price increase of one thing  or another whilst vigorously opposing our wage increases to  keep up with price increases. Wage earners increases have in

fact fallen behind price increases. The Government will pay for  very little of this increase in medical costs out of the  increases petrol prices, which have been disguised tax increases  .  in fact. Most of the increases cost of doctors' fees will fall

directly onto the wage earners. Or will it be you and I again?

Incidentally, if the average wage would have to be increased  by $18 per week if it were to buy as much as the average  .  wage would buy when Labor was in office in 1975! So much

for restroing the value of wages by the Liberals.
