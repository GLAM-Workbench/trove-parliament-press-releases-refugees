JULIA GILLARD M.P. Shadow Minister for Population & Immigration

MEDIA RELEASE

Todayâ€™s announcement by Minister Ruddock of a new detention centre on Christmas Island is an admission that the Pacific Solution is an expensive failure.

The stated rationale of the so-called Pacific Solution was to prevent asylum seekers from setting foot on Australian soil.

Christmas Island is Australian soil.

This confirms that the farcical Pacific Solution was an expensive charade designed for an election campaign, not a refugee policy.  From inauspicious start to inauspicious finish, it has lasted barely six months.

Moreover, both the residents of Christmas Island and the State Government have said this afternoon that they were not consulted about this plan until after its announcement today.

In the meantime, it has cost Australian taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars.

Stay tuned for the removal of the multi million dollar a day naval blockade of asylum seekers and the closure of the multi million dollar a day camps on Nauru and Manus Island.

Six months on from the Tampa, four months on from the election, with hundreds of millions of dollars down the drain, asylum seekers will be landing at Christmas Island exactly as hundreds of previous boats have done - on Australian soil.
