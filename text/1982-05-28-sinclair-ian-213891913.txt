OFFICIAL OPENING BY RT HON.  IAN SINCLAIR, MINISTER FOR DEFENCE,  OF HMAS CAIRNS ON FRIDAY, 28TH MAY, 1982, AT 2.15 P.M. IN CAIRNS

Naval forces and their role are very much in the minds of most

Australians as a result of the sad events in the Falkland Islands

in the South Atlantic.

Both climatically and geographically, Cairns and Port San Carlos

are remote from each other. Yet the importance of the port of

Cairns to Australia in naval terms and that of Port San Carlos

in the British recovery in the Falklands are immediately apparent.

HMAS Cairns represents part of the firm objective of the Commonwealth

Government to upgrade the key base facilities around Australia.

This program is well underway. We see its product with the

modern base, HMAS Stirling, at Garden Island in Western Australia,,,

and in the extensive modernisation plan now in progress for the

whole of Sydney's Garden Island.

HMAS Cairns represents another important stage in this program,

as will the new Darwin Patrol Boat Base which is to be opened

later in the year.

In respect of the HMAS Cairns, it is appropriate to place on

record my gratitude to the Cairns Harbour Board and the Queensland

Government for their cooperation in enabling the Commonwealth

to obtain a long lease for the site.

Similarly, I shpuld express my appreciation for the outstanding '

work done by the principal contractors and by the Department of

Transport and Construction in the design and management of the

project.

Today marks the culmination of a series of developments in

naval operations out of Cairns. In 1971 Attack-Class patrol

boats were first base-ported here, and in 1974 temporary

administration and maintenance facilities were commissioned

as HMAS Cairns. Following the decision in 1978 to build the

Fremantle-Class patrol boats, it was decided to establish the

permanent base.

The main facilities for the base are a fully serviced wharf

which can accommodate a number of Attack-Class vessels and

survey motor launches, as well as the vessels that are permanently

based here.

The Command/Administration building will contain offices, an

operations room, communications centre, hydrographic chart room,

medical and dental facilities and a technical library.

The workshop building houses mechanical and electrical shops

and will provide gun maintenance and diving and lifecraft facilities

The covered maintenance berth, when complete, will accommodate up

to two Fremantle-Class boats in sheltered conditions.

There will obviously be considerable benefits flowing on to

Cairns from the new patrol boat base.

Some 112 naval personnel will be stationed here, contributing

to the life of this flourishing community, and some 40 houses will

be acquired in the area for married personnel.

- 3-

There are,  of course,  also advantages to the Navy flowing from

the location in Cairns of long established North Queensland

Engineers and Agents works, which has already built five

Fremantle-Class patrol boats and will build another nine.

Earlier this week there was a suggestion that orders for additional

patrol boats had been cancelled.

This is not correct.

In. 1981 the Government announced that it envisaged a possible

ten additional Fremantle patrol boats, above the 15 already ordered.

It is the timing of the acquisition and letting of contracts

of these ships that has now been deferred.

NQEA's workmanship is of a high quality. They also undertake

the bulk of refits and overhauls for the Attack-Class patrol boats

of the RAN and the PNG Defence Force.

From today the base will provide support for the Oceanographic

Research Ship HMAS Flinders, two Fremantle-Class patrol boats,

and one Attack-Class patrol boat. By 1985 the base will provide

permanent support for Flinders and four Fremantle-Class boats.

Thus,  as I indicated earlier, HMAS Cairns represents another very

important feature of our naval policies - the emphasis that we have

given to patrol boat surveillance in the waters off our island

continent.

- 4 -

The scope of these patrols is enormous.  The boats operating out

of HMAS Cairns, for example,  patrol some 2,500 nautical miles of

mainland coast from Cape Wessell in the Northern Territory to the

Swain Reefs near Mackay.  This covers several thousands of square

nautical miles, including the Gulf of Carpentaria and the Great

Barrier Reef.

The responsibilities of these patrols are vital to Australia. An

effective maritime surveillance and patrol service is an essential

element of our Defence capability. It enhances our ability to

respond to potential low-level threats.

Equally important, however, is the contribution that the patrols

make to civil coastal surveillance and maritime law enforcement

operations. Ã¢ÂÂ

It would be very difficult to overestimate the importance of

their role in terms of the prevention of the introduction of

exotic human,  animal and plant diseases through illegal landings.

Without the patrol boats,  our proximity to many unstable SouthÂ­

East Asian countries could cause very serious problems of illegal

immigration. Related to this, of course, is the humanitarian

assistance that the patrols have given to refugees.

Similarly, the work of the patrol boats in the areas of customs

and fisheries is of essential interest to the Australian community

and our economy.

- 5-

It might be observed by some that the circumstances of the

encounters of the patrol boats with intruders in our waters

appear to be in the nature of low-key police work.  This perhaps

might especially appear to be the case at a time when our newspapers

are presenting us with vivid photographs of ships ablaze in

intense naval battles.

Nevertheless,  we must not lose sight of the fact that these

relatively small patrol boats operate in dangerous seas not far

from areas where piracy is common and where the law of the sea

is frequently disregarded.

The stresses and tensions under which many relatively junior officers,

faced with very senior responsibilities, have to operate are just

as real as they would be in the circumstances of greater conflict.

Indeed there are those who would suggest that patrol boat numbers

should be increased while capital ship numbers in the RAN reduced.

While recognising the outstanding contribution of our patrol

vessels, I believe the Government's decision in favour of a

balanced naval force is the only correct one for a nation

surrounded by three of the major oceans of the world.

There is an unfortunate tendency to forget how important a properly

balanced naval, force is to an island nation like Australia.

Perhaps this is because,  in terms of travel and communications,

our island character has ceased to have an obvious effect.

Nearly every traveller into or away from Australia comes by air.

- 6-

Satellites and the other communications technologies have

brought the world into our living rooms.  Distance appears

superficially to have ceased to matter.

But we are an island. Our produce and our imports depend upon

our maritime approaches. Approximately 99 per cent of our trade

moves by ship, and on that our national prosperity depends.

We have learnt over recent months that troubles can flare up

unexpectedly and in unlikely areas, of the world. It will not

always be possible to know when we will need to protect our

maritime approaches or our island territories, or be given a

clear indication when some predator'nation might force Australia .

to protect them.

There seem to me to be three vital roles for our navy:

First, with the 200 mile fishing zone, to ensure that we control

our coastal waters and have some facility to police that 200 mile

limit.

Secondly, to ensure freedom of movement through the trading lanes

to our major ports.

Thirdly, to maintain the territorial integrity and sovereignty

of our continent and its island territories. Considerable "

strategic importance can be attached to these territories. They

are important as refuelling bases for long range surveillance aircraf

- 7 -

In a negative sense, it could one day become necessary to take

seriously the prospect of one or other of them being occupied

by some power who may want to use them as bases for operations

against continental Australia.

With respect to tactics and armaments,  there are many present

lessons to be learnt in the first naval engagement since World

War II in that precipated by the Argentinian invasion of the'

Falkland Islands.

The naval engagements in the Falklands require us to give serious

attention to some fundamental questions about aircraft,  armaments,

defensive devices,  fire power,  fire protection,  ship design and

military tactics.

To ensure an adequate understanding of these lessons, a high

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ s '  level committee has already been set up in association with the

_ CDFS and the Secretary of Defence to analyse the battle results..

Consistently Australia is being urged by some sections of the

media to make direct offers of military assistance to the United

Kingdom.

There has been no request from the United Kingdom for such

assistance and indeed I do not envisage Australian military

involvement in any way in the Falklands. If a request of any

sort were made from the Government of the United Kingdom, it

would of course be considered by the Australian Government.

- 8 -

However,  let me re-state that suggestions about the commitment

of any RAN ship to duties other than those in which they would

be engaged on normal tasks are not based on fact.

Australians have reason to be proud of their navy and the men

and women who serve in it.

Sophisticated equipment alone is inadequate without the dedication,

talent and skills they bring to their task.

Australia is fortunate in the record proudly maintained today,

as yesterday, in the capabilities of the ships of our fleet. .

I have no doubt that those who serve in and from HMAS Cairns will :

maintain the high traditions set by those who made the first

European exploration of our coastline so many years ago.

I feel honoured to declare HMAS Cairns open.
