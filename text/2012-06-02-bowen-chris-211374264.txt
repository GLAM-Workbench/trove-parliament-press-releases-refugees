More boats the consequence of Abbott inaction

Another asylum seeker boat arrived today, the 41st since Tony AbbottÃ¢ÂÂs  negativity dismissed offers of compromise from the Government to stop the flow  of boats and people risking their lives at sea.

The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Chris Bowen MP, and Minister for  Home Affairs, Jason Clare MP, said the Coalition needed to accept that their  actions had very negative consequences.

“The consequence of the Tony AbbottÃ¢ÂÂs refusal to support the GovernmentÃ¢ÂÂs  offshore processing legislation - including an offer to re-establish a centre on  Nauru - is more boat arrivals,” Mr Bowen said.

“By voting Ã¢ÂÂnoÃ¢ÂÂ in the Parliament last week, by playing politics with an issue that  is in the national interest, the Coalition is ensuring there is no deterrent in place  to prevent people from risking their lives on leaky boats.

“They are playing right into the hands of people smugglers, and they know it.”



Mr Clare said it was time Tony Abbott stopped saying no and voted to allow  offshore processing in Malaysia and Nauru.

“Let's remember what this is all about - 200 people died off the coast of  Indonesia and another 11 died off the coast of Malaysia,” Mr Clare said.

“Working together we can help stop people dying at sea. We can pass legislation  to introduce offshore processing.”
