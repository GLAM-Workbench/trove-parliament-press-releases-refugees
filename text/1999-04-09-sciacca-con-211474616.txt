KOSOVO REFUGEES - DETAILS NEED CLARIFICATION 
SAYS OPPOSITION

Â

The Federal Op position has noted the latest release of details 
by the Government on the humanitarian operation involving some 4000 
displaced Kosovo Albanians.

Â

Shadow Immigration Minister, Con Sciacca, said today 
that there were still many details which needed clarification.

Â

“The Opposition is concerned that sufficient thought 
has not been given to how the 4000 refugees will be treated when they 
arrive,” Mr Sciacca said.

Â

“Today’s announcement by Mr Ruddock suggests that 
the refugees will be initially accommodated at East Hills in Sydney 
and that the first group will then be sent to Brighton Barracks in Tasmania 
following health checks.

Â

“I am pleased that the Government has responded 
to calls by Opposition Leader, Kim Beazley, not to accommodate refugees 
in remote locations, as was first suggested by Mr Ruddock.

Â

“I am extremely concerned, however, that this whole 
operation is becoming more a military exercise than a humanitarian operation 
to provide safe haven for unfortunate human beings - mostly women, children 
and elderly men - caught up in a war not of their choosing.

Â

“While the Opposition has given in-principle support 
to the Government’s decision to grant temporary refugee status to 
the 4000 Kosovo Albanians, we remain concerned that the Government’s 
actions did not go far enough, given recent developments which change 
on a day to day basis.

Â

“The following questions must be answered by the 
Government:

Â

Ã¢ÂÂ¢Â  Why 
is it necessary to accommodate the refugees in military barracks (after 
initial processing and health checks) when there are numerous generous-hearted 
Australian families of Albanian origins and others are prepared to billet 
them in their homes?

Â

Ã¢ÂÂ¢Â  Why 
is the Government not prepared to investigate the possibility of allowing 
the refugees to be billeted when in reality the number being accepted 
by Australia would form no more than 15 or 20 per cent of the total 
attendance at a Brisbane Broncos vs Manly Rugby League match at ANZ 
stadium in Brisbane?

Â

Ã¢ÂÂ¢Â  Why 
is the Government so totally opposed to expanding the permanent refugee 
program on a one-off basis to adequately cater for what is no doubt 
one of the largest humanitarian crises since World War 2?

Â

Mr Sciacca said that he was particularly concerned that, notwithstanding 
the Government’s intention to quarantine t he temporary refugee 
status of the Kosovo Albanians, it was the Government’s responsibility 
- given the extent of their legal resources - to ensure that the proposed 
legislation, for which the Opposition has given in principle support, 
stood up to inevitable challenges through the Courts.

Â

“The Government must also provide and maintain appropriate 
support mechanisms to ensure that the refugees receive appropriate services 
— primarily counselling, language and medical support.

Â

“We will be closely monitoring the extent and adequacy 
of the proposed support services.”
