SUBJECTS: Cheryl Kernot, Leadership

TREASURER:



Well I think Mr Beazley's got a lot of explaining to do this morning because it now appears as if a letter has been written by the lawyers to the Commissioner of Stamp Duty in Queensland which outlines the situation concerning Cheryl Kernot's home. That letter ought to be released so that it's on the public record whether or not she was claiming the Gold Coast as her principal place of residence. Now Mr Beazley is apparently relying on this letter. The letter ought to be made public. Mr Beazley also has an obligation to get Cheryl Kernot to unreservedly apologise to the Liberal candidate in Dickson. It's not enough to cast a slur over somebody in the way that she did and then try and deny, grudgingly deny, what happened. He deserves an unreserved apology. He has a record to be proud of and Mrs Kernot should be unreservedly withdrawing all allegations and apologising to him.

JOURNALIST:

Cheryl Kernot is actually blaming Mr Abbott on the smear campaign. Do you say anything to that?

TREASURER:

Well, she of course is trying to deflect attention by personally attacking other people. But the facts are these, she has received a stamp duty concession on a home in relation to the Gold Coast. There's nothing wrong with that if that's her principal residence. But she's been telling the people of the electorate that her principal residence is in the electorate. Now if the principal residence is in the electorate she should not have been receiving stamp duty concessions in respect of the home on the Gold Coast. This can be easily cleared up if the lawyerÃ¯Â¿Â½s letter is released. Mr Beazley should one, release that letter and secondly the candidate in the seat of Dickson deserves an unreserved apology because he had this slur cast over him in relation to his service with the Queensland Police Force and there was nothing wrong in relation to his service for the Queensland Police Force.

JOURNALIST:

Will you be a loyal deputy to John Howard for three years if re-elected or are you seeking to step up a mark?

TREASURER:

IÃ¯Â¿Â½ve been the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party now for seven and a half years and in relation to that I don't think my loyalty has been questioned, not for a moment, and I don't think it can be.

JOURNALIST:

Latest polling suggests that a quarter of Coalition voters will not actually vote for the Government if you were to be leader, do you say anything to



that?

TREASURER:

Oh well I read, I thought that was an interesting poll actually because I think what the polling proved when you looked at it is what the story said that Labor's campaign against me has failed. And I would be very surprised if they keep their ads going. Nobody likes to have personal attacks made on them. But this was a personal attack that the Labor Party made and it failed. And we'll see if they're still running in two and three and four weeks time, I doubt somehow they will be.

JOURNALIST:

Can you see yourself being the deputy though for the next three years?

TREASURER:

I've been the Deputy Leader for seven and a half so I don't have any trouble being the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party.

JOURNALIST:

Would you rule out challenging for the leadership?

TREASURER:

I have. I have been the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party for seven and a half years and I've never had that loyalty questioned, not for a moment.

JOURNALIST:

Who do you think will be Prime Minister in three years?

TREASURER:

Well it would be a pity if it was Kim Beazley. That's all I can say. If it were Kim Beazley can you imagine where our country would be? Can you imagine where we would be if Labor was still running $10 billion deficits, we had another $60 billion worth of debt, if interest rates were 10.5 per cent, if you hadn't have had the strength to stand up in relation to unauthorised boat arrivals? You know what the tragedy of this campaign is? That a vote for Kim Beazley is a vote for Kim Beazley. That's the tragedy of this campaign.

Thanks.
