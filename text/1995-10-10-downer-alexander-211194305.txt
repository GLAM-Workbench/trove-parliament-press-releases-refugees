MEDIA RELEASE

ALEXANDER DOWNER MP  SHADOW MINISTER FOR FOREIGN  AFFAIRS  MEMBER FOR MAYO

GOVERNMENTHYPOCRISYOVERTIMOR

The Australian Government bas exposed itself to charges of hypocrisy over East  Tim.or and undermined its credibility on the issue of East Tim.or.

Statements by Senator Evans today that the Government would oppose applications  by some East Timorese for refugee status on the basis that they are under the  responsibility and protection of the Portuguese Government, confirm that the Keating  Government has been hypocritical and inconsistent in its attitude to East Timor.

Only recently, the Keating Government argued before the International Court of  Justice that Portugal has no responsibility for the people and territory of East Tim.or.

It is extraordinary that the Australian Govemment is now shamelessly back-flipping  and accepting the Portuguese Government's position after having previously rejected  it in the case before the World Court.
