Address - Canberra - 7 November 2001

Check Against Delivery

An election result defines a nation.

A government affects the entire community - for good or bad.

It influences a country's optimism, its self-confidence, its inventiveness, its good heartedness.

On the other hand, a government can leave its people convinced that the only opportunities available are for the few, not the many.

That is the Howard Government's way, but it is not our way.

We have come into this election campaign with a unique status. We are the only Party with a plan for the long-term future for all Australians.

A complete plan that addresses the needs of all our children through their early years and into their schooling. Ã¢ÂÂÃ¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»

A plan for lifelong education and training, that starts the process of turning us into an innovative and creative nation. Ã¢ÂÂÃ¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»

A plan that will end the brain drain, and that will end the sorry tales of great Australian inventions going offshore. Ã¢ÂÂÃ¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»

A plan to provide good jobs for Australians now and into the future Ã¢ÂÂÃ¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â» A plan for decent hospitals, medical care after hours, and decent care for the elderly. Ã¢ÂÂÃ¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»

If elected on Saturday, Labor will carry out these plans.

Labor will be a government that understands there must be changes to the GST, a complex and burdensome tax, making this government the highest-taxing in Australia's history.

We will make the GST fairer for ordinary Australian families and simpler for small business.

In Government we will respond to the concerns of ordinary people, address their reasonable needs, and provide equal opportunity for all.

Today I want to cast forward to give you a view of how Australia will change for the better under a Beazley Labor Government.

If elected to office this Saturday I will begin immediately to carry out my plan to put schools, hospitals and families first.

For too long, under this government, the wealthy have come first, well ahead of the interests of struggling Australian families.

Families carry this country. Families bear the burden of the great costs for future generations.

It is they who put kids through the most expensive years of their life - so it is they who deserve relief from those burdens.

That is why our changes to the goods and services tax are for everybody.

Walk down any street and 90 percent of people will miss out on John Howard's baby bonus tax plan. Ninety-five per cent of taxpayers will receive no benefit whatsoever from his modest superannuation tax cut for high income earners.

But with Labor in office, by the end of our first three years, the GST will be completely removed from a range of items essential to all families.

The GST will be off electricity and gas bills. And what a difference that will make to those under financial pressure.

A ten percent tax off your electricity account may not mean much to John Howard or Peter Costello, but it means a great deal to struggling families, and pensioners and others on a fixed income.

The GST will be off children's nappies - a real benefit to new parents, not a read-the-fine-print promise like John Howard's so-called baby bonus and pensioner bonus.

When a pensioner pre-pays his or her funeral costs, there will be no GST to pay.

We will take it off women's sanitary items, and off caravan park and boarding house rentals.

And when a charity steps in to help people in an emergency, there will no longer be a GST to pay on peoples' bills.

And thanks to our plan to make GST compliance simpler and fairer, most small businesses - like my local pharmacist -- will get their weekends back.

Let's look at what a Labor win will mean for education.

By the end of three years the schools in this country will be funded on the basis of need, not privilege.

New early learning classes will give more 3 and 4 year olds a better start in life, at a time when research tells us stimulation is so crucial.

Up to 10,000 teachers will have been re-trained, and thousands of our brightest young school leavers will have chosen teaching as a career.

There will be almost 2,500 new teachers in our schools to reduce class sizes and improve standards.

Hundreds of our public schools will be repaired and their facilities improved.

Every child, not just the better off in Category One schools, will get a fair go.

Let's look at universities and research - the building blocks of the Knowledge Nation - the places from which new inventions and new jobs will emerge.

Under a Labor Government in three years time the CSIRO and our universities will get the extra funds, and the respect, they deserve.

Businesses that invest in research and development at our universities, the CSIRO, or other public institutions by that time will get a 200 percent tax incentive.

Thousands of Australians of all ages, from the city and country, will be getting a world-class education through the University of Australia Online.

HECS will be easier to repay.

In health care: we will begin restoring public hospitals as the centrepiece of a reinvigorated health system.

Medicare After Hours clinics around Australia will be established, and the new 24-hour medical advice line will be operating nationally.

We will have implemented Australia's first National Cancer Plan and upgraded our stock of radiotherapy machines so that treatment is available for all who need it.

We will have addressed problems with nurse education and made substantial progress on fixing local nurse shortages.

The National Dental Health Scheme for pensioners and low-income earners will be back in place.

And we will have made substantial progress towards reducing waiting times for surgery and emergency treatment, and achieving national benchmarks for the quality of service

Let's look at jobs.

By the end of three years we will have moved to help more Australians obtain and retain good jobs. Unemployed Australians will know they have a government on their side.

We will have funded more than 23,000 Knowledge Nation apprenticeships, on our way to our target of 35,000, to give young Australians a chance of a professional career.

We will be helping nearly 140,000 students move from school into the workforce by funding expert job advice under the Jobs Pathways Program.

We will provide employer incentives for up to 32,000 people to graduate from Work for the Dole with a real apprenticeship.

We will have assisted more than 5,000 long-term unemployed Australians into work by allowing them to use their unemployment benefits as a wage subsidy.

And very importantly, every Australian worker will know that their entitlements are 100 percent protected by our national insurance scheme.

Then there's aged care - care for elderly Australians who certainly deserve better than Bronwyn Bishop. Kerosene baths in our nursing homes will be a horror movie from the past. As I said at our campaign launch: money in, Bronwyn out.

Our interest-free loans will put beds in areas where there are shortages, and will ensure our frail aged can get a bed in their local community when they need one.

We will improve the wages and conditions of aged care staff, and provide post-graduate scholarships for aged care nurses.

We will implement a national standard of care to improve the care of every older Australian in every nursing home

At the other end of the age scale, young mothers will receive extra payments under their Family Account, and there will be extra payments for larger families. Working parents will have better childcare as a result of 30,500 extra Out of School Hours places.

With Labor in office our great national institutions will be protected and nurtured.

And I can promise you this: Telstra will remain in the hands of its majority shareholder - the Australian people.

Within our first term, ABC funding will have been restored to 1995-96 levels in real terms, and we will have helped rebuild the community's confidence in the independence of the ABC.

And there'll be no deregulation of Australia Post. We will improve the access of those outside the cities to a wider variety of Government and financial on-line services, including banking.

And with our Social Charter in place, the banks will be working for their customers, instead of the other way round.

We will invest $140 million in building better broadband networks in rural and regional Australia.

There will be national leadership on the environment, with new plans to deal with salinity, climate change, and the quality of our soil and water.

So these are the priorities of a Beazley Labor Government. Schools, hospitals and families first.

What the Australian people will get if they elect me is a leader with 21 years experience in the Federal Parliament.

I was a Minister for 13 years, including 5 years as Defence Minister, during which I helped restructure the Australian/US alliance.

And now that experience will be directed towards trying to restore Australia's role in our region, and our enthusiastic engagement with the world.

I can describe the problem no more clearly than did foreign affairs experts Garnaut, Drysdale and Harris in today's Australian. Let me quote them:

Australia's official relations with the Asia-Pacific region are more fragile and less productive than at any time for several decades. This has jeopardised Australia's national security. It also threatens the prosperity that has accompanied productive relations with countries in our neighbourhood over the past decade.

The fact is, under the Coalition, our diplomatic relationships have languished. They must be renewed.

As I've said before, I'm the only candidate for Prime Minister who plans to be around for the long haul, to be here to implement my policies over the next three years to the next election and beyond.

The view three years ahead and beyond is not a perspective available to my opponent. I notice today the Liberal Party has already begun squabbling over Mr Howard's succession in his seat of Bennelong, with that perennial contender Malcolm Turnbull waiting in the wings.

The fact is, we know what a Howard Government would be three years from now. It would be a Peter Costello Government.

Under a Costello government, in three years' time there will still be a GST on electricity and gas: we know that.

And the rate would be higher than 10 percent.

And the GST would be imposed on all food-we've heard Peter Costello say that's what he'd like to do if he 'had his way'. Well, if John Howard is allowed to hand him the Prime Ministership, Peter Costello will have his way.

You saw John Howard yesterday imploring people to believe he had no intention of lifting the GST rate. But I also noticed he couldn't bring himself to use the words he devalued so deeply - never, ever.

Howard and Costello intend to raise the GST rate and extend it to cover food. Don't believe them when they say they couldn't do it without the support of the States - the NSW Crown Solicitor's advice today confirms the Coalition could lift the rate, and extend the tax to food simply with a vote in Federal Parliament.

Only this morning Peter Costello was on Radio 3AW saying that all of us were better off as a result of the GST. He said that when he looked at all the income groups in Australia, he had found "all of those groups are ahead".

How out of touch can he be! If he thinks everyone is better off now, there'll be nothing to stop him making this GST even bigger and broader.

Labor has another plan, and that is to go in entirely the opposite direction to relieve the burden of the GST on families.

My opponents response to the crises in health and education and aged care is to tell people they'd better get used to it. If re-elected, they won't put a penny extra where it's needed to deal with these problems.

But those whose kids go to a Category One school will be benefiting to the tune of an extra playing field,

or a couple of new swimming pools.

Under Howard and Costello, there'll be nothing to improve our universities. The CSIRO, the ABC, Australia Post - all these would continue to run down because Peter Costello does not approve of what they stand for.

In the event of a Coalition victory, Mr Howard won't or can't say who would be minister for defence or the minister for health.

I guess Bronwyn can't do both.

But there is every indication that David Kemp would remain Minister for Education and proceed to implement his plan for $100,000 university degrees.

On the 7.30 Report this week, Dr Kemp pointedly refused to rule out deregulated university fees and replacing HECS with real interest rate student loans.

When Dr Kemp says he wants to give young Australians the "opportunity" to invest in their education, he means only one thing: he wants to force students to pay higher fees.

His plan is in his bottom drawer: deregulate student fees, scrap HECS and introduce real interest rate loans.

And another thing we know for sure, a re-elected Coalition government will sell Telstra.

We know that because Peter Costello has named the price, and named the date.

It was his best contribution to this campaign - his fateful Friday press release that let the cat out of the bag.

I'm sure that one day Peter Costello will be asked by his grandchildren: "Grandad, what did you do in the 2001 election campaign?"

And his answer will be: "I confirmed the Liberal and National Parties' plan to sell all of Telstra. Date, Time, Place and Price!"

On the day the election was called I said the election was all about security at home and security abroad.

You know our position on events abroad. I have been at one with Tony Blair and George Bush on Australia's need to be part of the international coalition against terrorism. Those young Australians serving in the conflict in Afghanistan have my total support and admiration.

Let me briefly remind you of something that I have said a number of times - I want to assure you that under a Labor Government there will be no conscription for the current deployment of Australians to the war in Afghanistan.

We have a very well-trained, well-equipped professional force, and as a former Defence Minister I can tell you it is highly capable of doing the job required of it.

Labor has a systematic strategy for making Australia more secure.

We also have a realistic appreciation of how to handle the penetration of our borders by those coming

here illegally.

We've supported the Government's legislation. We support the legislation, and we will be retaining it in its current form.

We know more has to be done.

The long-term solution to this lies in a diplomatic agreement in the neighbourhood and only the Labor Party can offer that outcome with credibility.

But we also need to introduce Labor's plan for a Coast Guard, to be on the beat for better border protection every day of the year - not just before an election.

The Coast Guard will allow the Navy to go back to its primary task -- training for military defence.

If re-elected on Saturday John Howard will stick around for a short time, leading a stale, tired government, out of puff, out of ideas, out of leadership.

I guess every campaign has an episode that sums up the whole nature of the government seeking re-election.

In this campaign, it's the family debt scandal that has caught up 200,000 families in a debt trap they weren't going to be told about until after the election.

Nothing illustrates the cynicism and arrogance of this government more than this affair.

When he introduced the GST, John Howard also changed the system for family payments and called it GST compensation.

John Howard's so-called GST compensation now has families racking up large debts to the Government.

When Labor first exposed the problem prior to the Aston by-election, Mr Howard cobbled together a short-term political fix to waive the first $1,000 of each family's debt. But he did not fix the problem for the long term.

The debts have continued to mount ever since.

Centrelink has been instructed by the Government to hide the extent of the problem until after the election.

Because of the flaws in John Howard's system, almost 200,000 families are still likely to be hit with debts - even after the $1,000 waiver is applied.

These debts average about $850 each per family.

One of those affected by this cover-up phoned John Laws on Monday.

A former Ansett employee in Victoria, he had gone to a Centrelink office to see about receiving unemployment benefits only to be told he had racked up $1700 in family debt, of which he would be required to repay $700 starting at Christmastime.

According to this worker, a Centrelink officer confided in him that he wasn't supposed to be told of this debt until after the election.

Families should also know that the $1,000 waiver applies for one year only - and that many thousands of them are racking up new debts for the future.

If the picture is the same as last year, four months into this financial year there are about 750,000 families accumulating debt!

Labor will fix this ongoing problem by introducing a flexible scheme in which changes in income to do not lead to ongoing family debt.

What a contrast with us: a mean and tricky Liberal Government that wants to sweep its contempt for families under the carpet until after polling day.

And on the other hand Labor's plan to help struggling families.

Well, we in the Labor Party have already announced an affordable range of carefully crafted, carefully costed policies designed to help Australians deal with the problems they face.

All our plans were examined carefully by a reputable firm of independent financial experts, Access Economics, a firm used by both sides of politics and the media.

Everything has been costed down to the last dollar. Don't take any notice of the antics of the Coalition in its desperate attempt to find problems with our costings.

They simply aren't there.

I notice today that Chris Murphy, of Econtech - lately used by the Government to attack us - has acknowledged that even on his reckoning Labor's plans keep the Budget in surplus.

And I was pleased to see today also that Laura Tingle has put the lie to the Coalition fiction that our plans will cost more than $10 billion. If the Liberals had any integrity at all, they would pull their TV advertisement voluntarily.

Our policies are affordable, and they are deliverable.

We believe in retaining surpluses, and we are not raising taxes. We believe that good economic management delivers the growth that leads to more jobs, and more Australians playing their part in the knowledge economy.

If we don't invest in a fair and knowledgeable society we face a very uncertain future.

And if we do not invest in a fair and knowledgeable society, we cannot guarantee Australia's security at home and security abroad.

When the Government changes, the nation changes.

A change to Labor will be a change to a government on the side of Australian families.

Labor's proposals are an agenda for putting schools, hospitals and families first. We are committed to improving services-not just for the privileged few - but for everyone in Australia.

I tell you how I see that Australia:

A country with good schools for all our kids.

A country with public hospitals that can treat family members promptly and safely.

A country with decent and dignified aged care.

A country where jobs are more secure, and workplaces fair.

And a place where people turn to each other, not against each other, in difficult times.

This is the vision Labor has laid out in this campaign.

I invite this nation, this coming Saturday to tell John Howard a few things.

Tell him it is not OK to slug families with crippling debts, and to try to hide the evidence.

Tell John Howard it is not right to put schools, hospitals and families last.

Tell John Howard it is not OK to campaign on leadership, and then refuse to stay on as leader to be accountable to the people.

Australia doesn't need a part-term Prime Minister.

And tell John Howard it is certainly not OK for Australia to be left in the hands of Peter Costello.

As I said at the start, an election result defines a nation.

If Labor is elected in three days time, you'll have a secure and certain nation.

What I offer is a government of hope, not fear.

A government that embraces the future, rather than seeking refuge in the past.

A confident engagement with our region and the world, not a fearful turning away from limitless opportunity.

A country of hope, of tolerance, of reconciliation - with a belief that everybody counts; that nobody is dispensable.

A country with a government on the side of its people, with a plan for decent aged care, quality schools and hospitals, and a fair share for families.

That's what I offer for the future.

That's what I stand for.

ALP News Statements

National Press Club Questions And Answers Kim Beazley - Leader of the Opposition

Transcript - Canberra - 7 November 2001

E & OE - PROOF ONLY

Journalist: The Prime Minister today said that Labor is a threat to interest rates. He said that you have form on it. But I put to you that both our major parties are a threat to interest rates if there's a link between interest rates and budget surpluses. We already know from the mid-year economic review that the budget is in fiscal or accrual deficit and that there's only a half a billion dollars worth of fat there and that our main trading partners, the people we sell things to, are either in recession or heading that way in a big hurry.

If you're not a threat to interest rates, how will you avoid being one?

BEAZLEY: Well, you know, John Howard is in that phase of the campaign where you say anything, do anything. Commit any deception to try and get yourself re-elected, that's where he's at. I suspect it's probably not where he expected to be in this election campaign but that's where he is.

Look, one of the reasons why we have had all our policies so carefully costed as they have been; one of the reasons why a lot of our policies include redirecting funds that are already there; and one of the reasons why our policies include savings as well as the other things that we're doing, is because we are absolutely determined to maintain the budget surpluses that are … the budget in surplus in the way in which it is predicted to be in surplus over the course of the next four years in the forward estimates.

That's what we've been doing. That's why we've had Access Economics riding shotgun on our funding arrangements and making certain that they guarantee off every item. And they are the most reputable body when it comes to making these estimates outside government. That's why we've had all of them in place to do these things for us.

We now exist in a low interest rate environment globally. The only threat that there's been out there to interest rates in recent times was the government's implementation of the Goods and Services Tax which had it's own impact on inflation. What we want to pursue when we are in office is a strategy of budget

surpluses, of being able to invest in the nation whilst at the same time maintaining budget surpluses and in that way keeping the pressure off interest rates. That's what we intend to do.

And we intend, of course, to keep whipping inflation. That's what we did in the latter years of the time that we were in office and that's what we'll continue to do should we be elected on Saturday. So that's just part of John Howard's scare campaign. We'll run budget surpluses, we won't impact on interest rates.

Journalist: You spoke today of influencing the country's good-heartedness and yet you, alongside John Howard, are being accused by a growing list of prominent Australians of heartlessness on asylum seekers and the policies. Last week you agreed with John Howard, I think, in imposing or maintaining the visa limitations on the man whose three children died in the boat drowning a couple of weeks ago, in not allowing him to leave the country and come back in to visit his wife. Do you really believe that if you had allowed that man to return Australians would perceive you as weak, and you could lose the election? Is that how powerful a negative this issue is for you and for Labor? And do you disagree with the criticism from those prominent Australians?

BEAZLEY: Well, if the criticism is directed … and yes, I do … at me, then I do disagree with it. And I disagree with the basic premises. We maintain a policy of generosity towards the entry of refugees into Australia. If you look at the UNHCR's list of those who are engaged in this process I think we run second. That is of course a position that was achieved under the previous Labor government but it's been sustained on a bipartisan basis since then.

Now, if you decide to admit refugees to your country on the basis of being part of a controlled program, you actually have to control the program. It's as simple as that. And what that means is that you ensure that people who come in as refugees go in through a proper process. And what we have confronted for a long period of time, since before the Howard government came into office indeed, for a long period of time, is the threat to that program which successive governments have sat down and attempted to negotiate that threat away. And, in the interim, have taken quite hard steps to make sure that criminals who would seek to benefit from the trade are deterred from trying to benefit from the trade by the knowledge in the region generally that those who get through don't automatically get into Australia. It's not a new thing. Mandatory detention, for example, was part of the early phases of trying to deal with that particular problem and that was invented by the Labor Party. We did it because we wanted to protect the program.

The problem, the difference between what was then, and what is now is simply this, the Howard government lost control, and it lost control fundamentally because of the difficulties it was experiencing in its relationships with the region. Those difficulties have many manifestations now, one of them is an inability of this government to get to grips with this issue regionally. And we have had on several occasions when we have been in office to do that, and we've always secured an agreement.

So what we have now is a situation where there's an absolute imperative on the government of the day, the government elected on Saturday, to get in place a regional solution to this problem. If you do that, the horrors that you see and that you don't see - you saw one particular ship that was sunk, there are many ships that have sunk, and have been for a long period of time - the horrors that you see from time to time on your television which have been repeated as I said in times past, unless you can get effective deterrents in place. And that can only be done in the end not just simply by the measures that have been put through, but by an agreement in the region, then you don't have a solution.

I don't think it's un-humanitarian to try and keep control of your refugee program. I don't think it's un-humanitarian to try to deter criminals and nor do I think it's un-humanitarian to get decent agreements on their movement in the region. The Labor Party's been able to do all that in the past and we could do it again.

Journalist: So would that man have gone back?

BEAZLEY: The point about that, my friend, is when you're sitting there trying to keep control of an immigration policy which is generous, you have to acknowledge the fact that what you're dealing with is a situation where deterrence is important and order in your program is important. You've got to understand that there are criminals selling the generosity of Australia. They've been selling the generosity of Australia for some time. And the humanitarian solution to this problem is to get an agreement with the Indonesians whereby an orderly process proceeds, whereby we have people classified properly in Indonesia, supported by us, and where within our refugee cap we accept people on the basis of our fair share. And then the families of these people will not be in the hands of these criminals and their lives will not be at risk.

Journalist: Mr Beazley, just before the election was called, you called John Howard the most considerable conservative politician the country has produced in your lifetime in politics. Do you stand by that very generous assessment, given your opponent has anything but returned the compliment during the campaign?

BEAZLEY: I regard it as part of a valedictory speech for John Howard because, you see, I knew he was retiring.

And I thought if the election went our way he might retire even earlier and he will have disappeared from Parliament before I had a chance to say the nice things you say about your political opponents when they go. But, can I say this, I believe in a civilised discourse in politics. I don't believe in winner take all politics. I believe, as a Prime Minister in governing for all Australians. I don't believe in dividing the community; I believe in uniting it. I believe in from time to time, extending the hand of friendship to my political opponents.

I think it's necessary for me to take that view of life, because should I be elected on Saturday, for example, I'd want to have dealings with people in the business community who voted Liberal all their lives, who'll be important to employing Australians. I want to deal with many of those who have been Liberal Party supporters who may find themselves active in various voluntary organisations around the place. People like Malcolm Fraser, for example, who's played such a role in CARE Australia. I don't believe, because you're a Liberal, you're excluded from an influence in political life merely because there is a Labor government in office. Now, from time to time, I may be criticised for excessive generosity of heart in that regard, but that's the way I see the world.

Journalist: To me, this election seems to be marked by areas where there is agreement between you and the government on the big issues that are playing out, which is illegal immigration, asylum seekers and terrorism. But there are issues where there are clear differences that haven't been raised in this campaign, namely reconciliation and the republic, which seems to have gone way off the agenda. Is this a reflection of internal Labor polling, and does that show that perhaps that there is not enough public support out there for an apology to Aborigines, to the Stolen Generation or for a republic one day?

BEAZLEY: Both in this speech, and in the speech that I gave on launching our campaign, I used the

expression reconciliation, and I think everybody knows what I mean when I say that. It's important to incorporate that. And I put down a very comprehensive view of the Australian Labor Party's attitude on another phase of voting for the republic, by which I stand. And during the course of this election campaign our spokesperson in that area put that policy out again.

I tell you what I've wanted to do in this election campaign. I've wanted to talk to the average Australian family under pressure. I wanted to clear as much of the deck as possible to get to the kitchen table, to get to where ordinary Australians are doing it tough. The people who are worried about what is happening in their public schools. The enormous doubts that are there about whether or not you can get your parent into aged care. The worries that they have about their hospitals. The concern that they have that they've got a government looking forward to the future, that there's going to be future jobs for them. The brain drain, the Australian ideas developed here but produced offshore. All these things, which in a complex amalgam now, add up to a basic sense of insecurity in the average Australian about themselves and their future.

And I could add to that too, because it's very much an emerging issue in today's society, the loss of your benefits when a company that you may be employed by goes belly up. Because we have one of the lowest rates of male participation, for example, in the work force over the age of fifty in the industrialised world.

There is amongst thousands, actually millions, of Australians, a great sense of insecurity, and they are just desperate for a government to say that they're on their side. So of course government is about many things. It's about dealing with the issues that you mentioned and many other issues as well that you didn't mention. But in an election campaign things do tend to get finely honed, and what you really have to say to Australians, I believe, in an election campaign: this is your future. If you elect me this is what we think we can do affordably. This is your chance in life. And I don't want you to think, that I hold all these other views and will do something about them, that I am distracted from my basic core obligation, and that is to have a government that's on your side.

Journalist: We've heard that the government's tough stand on the boat people is biting with blue collar workers, say, in Western Sydney. How much of a problem do you think that is for the Labor Party. And secondly, we've tried this question before: can you say clearly whether a Labor government would continue to turn away the boats or not?

BEAZLEY: Firstly, I've said right throughout this election campaign, as you know, since you've been following me around and have asked me these questions to the point of tedium no doubt for yourself, I'm in this fight as a fighter, not an analyst. And it's for people like yourself to write where you think the votes are going and what you think of the opinion polls and everything else. It's not for me. For me it's to keep my messages clear and uncluttered.

And the second part of your question deals with how we deal with these immigration issues. We supported all their legislation, we support the Navy being out there at the moment, though we do not believe that this is a job for the Navy. But we know very well the coastguard's not going to come in place tomorrow or on Monday morning, should we be elected to office, and so the Navy will have to continue to be used in that way.

We'll use whatever agreements the government has in place to deal with the problem that we have immediately to hand. So we're not backsliding on any of that, in answer to your question. But we do say

that more has to be done, and I actually have confidence in this. I suppose it's a long time since there was an Australian Prime Minister who had an active and valuable and fruitful dialogue in South-East Asia. I mean, it's been a sadly neglected region by this government and there's no doubt at all that the Prime Minister is highly discomfited whenever it is that he has to deal with national leaders in the region around us, particularly if they happen to be Indonesian.

Well, frankly I find it easy. I found it easy all my ministerial life. I found it a very easy area to operate in. I found it a very easy area to get solutions and agreements. Even when from time to time I've been in disagreement with ministers on one or two matters in the immediate region. It's not been a task that I've found impossible. And that is why … and I also know our record on immigration when we had to deal with threats from huge numbers of boat people coming here before. We had to sign up agreements on that in the region in the late 1980s. I mean, you don't know about these things now. Why? Because we fixed them. You wouldn't know about this now if we'd had a prime minister on the job, albeit immediately after the difficulties that Timor created, instead of standing on his digs and not going to meet the Indonesian President - it actually started early on - and said look, though we have this disagreement we have mutual interests and here's one of them. I know we wouldn't be confronting this situation now.

So I will fix it, and we'll fix it quickly. And it is a far better solution that firstly people go back to their point of embarkation and then get themselves properly processed there, and that within our cap we take our fair share.

But I know we like to worry around about this, but I actually don't see it as one of the massive problems that I have to resolve, because I think we can do it.

Journalist: Once again, Mr Beazley, the word union has not passed your lips in your vision of the future. I was just wondering, John Howard says that industrial relations is one of the key differences in the campaign and one of the most crucial issues. Do you agree, and in that case why aren't you doing more to sell your policies on industrial relations?

BEAZLEY: Oh well, you've cut me to the quick, Jennifer. Let me correct that problem by immediately announcing the word union. We actually have made quite a point of campaigning on industrial relations policy. I've done one or two public meetings on the subject of what we intend to do about industrial relations, and we regard the question of protection of workers entitlements as absolutely central, and the people who are fighting for that now in the Australian community basically are the union movement.

Look, our view on industrial relations is this: you've got to restore balance. The pendulum has been tipped too far against ordinary workers. The Industrial Relations Commission can no longer oblige workers and employers to bargain in good faith. The Industrial Relations Commission can no longer oblige the development of awards that relate to a particular industry or a particular industry's circumstances. They are hamstrung and fettered. And as a result of that, some pieces of industrial strife go on far too long. And there has been over the last couple of years not so much an increase in the rate of industrial relations disputation but a substantial increase in the rate of long-term disputes. Now, that's a product of the hamstring of the IRC's capacity to deal with these things.

So we have been quite pleased to discuss our industrial relations policies as we've gone around during the course of this election campaign, because I think the average Australian agrees with us, that in industrial relations there needs to be balance.

Journalist: I'd like to go back to the tedium if I may. The day after the Liberal Party's campaign launch, one commentator wrote with particular reference to John Howard's campaign on boat people, that he had shown us not what we could be or what we should be but the worst aspects of what we are. Now, you agree with Mr Howard that the boat people should be turned away and you also say that you're about uniting Australia. Given that this is taking place under the shadow of a war in Afghanistan, is this boat people policy really uniting Australia? What do you think of the commentator's description and why isn't it equally applicable to you?

BEAZLEY: It is true that this election campaign has been taking place in the shadow of great international insecurity and it has been important for me to talk about security abroad and security at home. And that's why I was particularly pleased to see that the ex-head of the NCA John Broome, having had a look at the security policies of both political parties make the judgement that the Labor Party's was much better. I think we know more about it than our political opponents do.

I support a policy on immigration that includes the provision of the acceptance of refugees. I believe we should do that. I've always believed that we should do that in an orderly fashion. This is not a new philosophy from the Australian Labor Party. This has always been our view. Our view on the need to sustain orderly entry into this country for refugees is a very old Labor Party policy. And our view that it needs to be orderly is a product not simply of a tidy mind but of a concern that there should be public support for it. You see, when you're operating the second most generous refugee policy of those in the UNHCR's program there is always the possibility that there will be a declining community support for it. Therefore it is imperative upon you to operate that policy in a way in which the community can have confidence.

And so it is important that they know that the folk who come into this country have been properly processed somewhere else, they've had the police checks, they've had the health checks, they've had the checks as to their genuineness all properly done and then we accept them. Twelve thousand a year, which is the government's cap with which we agree, is twelve thousand a year, not twelve thousand. That's quite a substantial number and it also creates opportunities down the line in relation to family issues. So you have to keep that sort of policy, which is a generous policy, in proper administration.

Now, when you've got criminals that are attempting to exploit it and make money by coming to people and saying, pay us this amount and you'll get to Australia and you'll get that amount, and you'll get that opportunity, I hate it. I hate to see people making money off the generosity of my people. And that's why I believe we've got to have an orderly program.

Now, whatever people say about the politics of it, we never ran away from that when we were in office. That's why we had things like mandatory detention; that's why we negotiated in South-East Asia that when people came to this country we send them back to be properly processed and why we succeeded in doing that. It was because … but nobody talked about it, nobody said that we were inhumane in the policies that we're pursuing, because what we were pursuing was a policy overall which was very humane indeed.

Our views haven't changed; they've not changed a bit. In all the period of time I've been a member of parliament, and then after that a Cabinet minister, and I remember the debates on the humanitarian program around the Cabinet table. Circumstances have changed because in the last three years the Government has let all this go and has missed the essential points in relation to how bound up this is without a policy in the region.

Well, the good news is you don't have to keep the government.

Journalist: Mr Beazley, I'm conscious of Ken's statement that my colleagues would appreciate it if I'm concise, but this is a competitive business, so sorry chaps. I've got two questions. The first question. Iain Duncan Smith, the new leader of the British Conservative Party and your mate Tony Blair as Opposition leader is using the slogan: Security at home and security abroad. Did he pinch it from you or did you pinch it from him? And, secondly, a question on the dog whistle issue of asylum seekers which, judging from your answers today, has you running scared. The Australian today cast doubt on government claims that asylum seekers threw children overboard. It quotes Christmas Island residents saying naval officers told them the allegations were untrue. Do you believe any Government would make up something as serious as this to win votes, and do you believe the government should release a video of the incident the Defence Minister Peter Reith says proves the claims, and what would you do to investigate this if you happen to win on Saturday?

BEAZLEY: Well, can I first say that I should have patented the slogan obviously, because clearly Iain Duncan Smith has pinched it from me. And far be it for me to create any discomfort for my friend Tony Blair by others picking up our policies or our statements about what ought to be done. All I can say is in return on that, Tony Blair's always been very generous to us about the amount of Labor Party policy he picked up in the implementation of the new Labour agenda in the UK.

On the question that you raise about the naval officer statements about the truth of government statements, about whether or not people have been thrown overboard, I'd say this: I rely like you do on the truthfulness of Government. When a Government tells me that there were people being thrown overboard and they say it in all seriousness, I believe them. Whether they are Liberal or Labor I believe them because Governments are supposed to know those things. So, I've been operating on the assumption like everyone else that the Government was telling the truth about that. We could arrive at that truth if the Government released a video. And I would certainly urge the Government to release the video so we can say, all of us, whether or not what has been said is true.

But I'll go a point further. I know the Navy very well and I know what the Navy would rather be doing with the capacities that it has to defend this nation. The Navy does not consider itself a Coastguard. I think that what is being done in terms of what has to be done, in terms of proper border protection requires not the Navy, which is tooled up to fight major war. So, that we have ships out there carrying harpoon missiles, gatling guns, three point six inch guns and torpedoes who are there … with great air defence radars, who are there for dealing with a hot war situation, dealing with these semi-piratical craft.

What we need is not those types of first class capital ships operating in this environment, we need a tough constabulary. People properly trained in all those things that the police are ultimately trained in, a proper border protection force called a coastguard. That's what I think we need. And then any difficulties being experienced by the naval officers to whom you allude would not occur. But there is no doubt in my mind that that doubt having been raised and that the … a challenge to the government's integrity being offered by people of great integrity, those who command our warships, then I think the video should be released.

Journalist: You said an election result defines a nation, in fact you said it several times. It might also be said that an election campaign helps to define a nation. And forgive me, this question follows on from several of those asked by my esteemed colleagues: If you put your historians hat on, how do you think history will judge this campaign, Labor's role and your role in it? And what are the consequences for the

future of some of the issues which have been unleashed in this campaign such as sectarianism? What do you plan to do about putting the sectarian genie back in the bottle if you're elected? And would you advocate an increase in the refugee intake as a consequence of the war which you support unreservedly?

BEAZLEY: That's about seven questions, Tony, fair dinkum. Firstly, if I look at this campaign historically and you invite me, instead of being an analyst to be a historian, a profession which I fervently hope not to return to anytime soon, I'd say this: I think that we deserve credit for putting on the agenda of the Australian people, the issues that worry them. To present a future of a nation, a nation that is creative and innovative, in which all people have an equal opportunity to benefit and share. Well, we have put that forward in this election campaign uniquely.

Generally speaking, your political opponents in the Liberal Party make a pretence to doing the same. They have made no such pretence in this election, they have left that field to Labor. And I'm enormously proud of the fact that despite all the difficulties in the international environment in which we operate, I've had some success in getting on to the agenda of this nation, the future of this nation. Because these futures will last well beyond any conflict in Afghanistan and well beyond a resolution of this particular set of border protection issues. They will be done quite quickly. Development of a knowledge society in a creative nation is a decade's worth of program. And I have put forward the start of that in this election campaign.

So, what about the issue of sectarianism? Well, I'll just state this as a belief about myself and my fellow Australians and how I view the Prime Minister of this nation, the role of a Prime Minister of this nation. My job as Prime Minister of this nation is to make every Australian no matter what their racial background, what their ethnic background, what their religious background, what their economic background is concerned, everyone of them think of themselves as a stakeholder. That this is a nation for them. This is a great multicultural, multifaceted society in which we all live with each other at peace and with pride in each other. That's my vision of this nation and I intend to pursue that vision.

On the question of additional refugees: when you are in a situation where you are the second most generous refugee contributing country in the UNHCR program, I think that's enough, frankly. I think that's good enough. The point is to keep a decent refugee program going. Twelve thousand a year's a lot. You contemplate that, building up over a period of time. That is quite a lot of people.

But I've also got to say in relation to the current situation in Afghanistan - and I think it's very important that those who are engaged in this conflict recognise and acknowledge this - the objective has got to be to get the people who are outside Afghanistan back into it. I mean, that's what we actually have to do. The problems that are being created now effectively amounts to depopulation of Afghanistan. It is not a useful outcome to have everybody quit Afghanistan except a few of the Taliban. I mean, that is not an acceptable outcome from this conflict. Afghanistan has sustained a proud people for centuries, and those people ought to be back in there. And what we ought to be doing at the conclusion of this is creating the situation whereby all those who are on the borders now with Pakistan, or across the borders in the Pakistani camps, we ought to be creating a situation to get them back into Afghanistan.

So what we don't have on our hands at this very minute is a problem of dispersing a group of people who've got no chance of going home. We've got a group of people who really must be got home. I know in the end that's what they want. The vast bulk of those refugees in those camps in Pakistan are not looking for an opportunity to go to Australia. They're looking for an opportunity to get back to their homes with a government that doesn't try to kill and oppress them.

Journalist: Prior to September 11, a basic tenet in the debate of the defence of Australia was that we would have a long lead time to conflict. That's clearly no longer true. Do you see scope in your first term in government to require some fresh thinking on the defence of Australia? Do you see scope for a white paper?

BEAZLEY: We were quite happy with the Government's white paper because they changed line. From looking as though they were going to pursue a particular course, the deputy sheriff's road, they walked back from that and simply replicated the Labor Party's strategy of defence self-reliance within the framework of alliances and a military strategy based on a force structure primarily determined to protect the approaches to Australia. So that was an acceptable outcome as far as we're concerned.

There are different sorts of threats. The long lead time threat is a threat that relates to invasion of Australia, large scale. That is, a territory-denying threat, something that would take a part or all of Australia away from us. There is a long lead time associated with that sort of threat, but there can be other threats that emerge with no warning at all. And certainly I think the events which occurred on September 11 have changed our view. That is why we have put forward a series of very constructive suggestions about proper border protection, and I mean … in proper border protection I'm talking there about what happens at airports, what might well happen in aircraft.

See, terrorists arrive in countries these days with good haircuts, in good suits, with impeccable credentials, all of which are false, but nevertheless impeccably drafted, and they disappear into your communities in a way that makes them scarcely detectable. That's a particularly interesting border protection problem that you confront.

And so we obviously need to think about that in the context of defence and we actually have to upgrade the SAS, probably provide that we do need to provide them with an extra squadron that's capable of handling these problems, and we've got to redefine the buy of army helicopters so it includes a capacity in those helicopters for long range insertion of the SAS and long range combat search and rescue.

These are things which will have to change in their priority in the defence white paper, but I don't think it requires a wholesale rewrite of the defence white paper. What it requires is more the sort of thing that Steve Martin talks about, about a regular update rather than a wholesale, ground-up review.
