Attached is a Report on the situation in Ethiopia  prepared by the Opposition Leader, the Hon. A.S. Peacock  on his return from a visit to that country in December  last year. '

Sa h e e l  and s u b- Saha ra n  Af r i c a  have- l e s s to do w i t h  dro ug ht

THAN WITH OTHER FACTORS. WHAT IS OCCURRING IS A FAMINE OF

POTENTIALLY CATASTROPHIC PORPORTIONS. IT IS A RESULT OF POOR

RAINS. IT IS ALSO A RESULT OF POOR SOIL AND WATER -

MANAGEMENT, OVER-CULTIVATION AND DEFORESTATION. THE EFFECTS

OF ALL THIS HAVE BEEN EXACERBATED BY FOOLISH AND

SHORT-SIGHTED GOVERNMENT POLICIES.

OF ITS OWN PEOPLE. A FURTHER FACTOR THAT CANNOT BE IGNORED '

THE EXTENT OF THE PROBLEM . - .

Ã¢ÂÂ   THE FAMINE IS EXTREMELY SEVERE IN THE NORTHERN PARTS

OF. THE COUNTRY, IN PARTICULAR THE PROVINCES OF WOLLO, T l G R A Y

AND E ATT REA. THE RELIEF CAMPS I V I S I T E D  WERE IN THE FI RS T

TWO OF THESE AREAS. THE CAMPS WERE OVERCROWDED, AND DEVOID

OF THE NECESSARY INFRASTRUCTURE. SHELTER, BLANKETS,

M E D IC IN E , AND TRAINED PERSONNEL WERE COMPLETELY INADEQUATE.

PEOPLE.

AS AN ILLUSTRATION OF THE PROBLEMS IT MIGHT BE USEFUL

TO BRIEFLY RECOUNT MY OBSERVATIONS AT THE VARIOUS CAMPS.

AT Me k e l e THE POPULATION OF THE CAMP HAD INCREASED Ã¢ÂÂ

FROM 2 7 , 0 0 0  TO 3 8 , 0 0 0  DURING THE PRECEDING TWO WEEKS. 1 5 , 0 0 0

1  WERE WITHOUT ANY FORM OF SHELTER AT THE TIME OF MY V I S I T .

THE DEATH RATE STOOD AT ABOUT 50 PEOPLE PER DAY. .

THE RRC STATED THAT AN ESTIMATED 6 M IL L IO N  PEOPLE WERE

AFFECTED BY THE FAMINE, AND FOOD A ID  REQUIREMENTS WERE PUT AT

BEING OVER 1 M IL L IO N  TONNES OF GRAIN. IN THEIR LATEST

REPORT, RELEASED IN DECEMBER, THE RRC ESTIMATED THAT THE

NUMBER OF PEOPLE NEEDING ASSISTANCE HAD INCREASED TO AROUND .

ABOUT 7 . 7 5  M I L L I O N .  THE RRC'S REVISED FOOD ASSISTANCE

REQUEST FOR THE PERIOD DECEMBER 1984 TO JANUARY 19 85 WAS FOR

A TOTAL REQUIREMENT OF 1 , 5 0 4 , 7 7 5  MTS OF GRAIN. AFTER TAKING

INTO ACCOUNT THEIR HANDLING CAPACITY THE ET HIOPIAN GOVERNMENT

O FF ICIALL Y REQUESTED 1 . 2 - M I L L I O N  TONNES OF GRAIN AND 1 0 0 , 0 0 0

TONNES OF SUPPLEMENTARY FOODS. ~

I HAVE NO REASON TO DOUBT THE DIMENSIONS OF THE ^

PROBLEM^AS REPORTED BY THE RRC. IN CONTACTS WITH THE RRC AT

DIFFERENT LEVELS I FOUND THEM TO' BE DEDICATED AND REASONABLY

c o m p e t e n t . Th ey a r e c o n f r o n t e d  w i t h, t h e d a y to d ay "

PEOPLE WHO HAD DIED IN THE PAST 12 MONTHS AND WERE ' CONT LNU I NG

TO DIE EACH DAY FROM FAMINE OR RELATED DISEASES.

Ther e i s p r o b a b l y  no way suc h f i g u r e s  can e v e r be

SUBSTANTIATED. IT IS SU FFICIEN T TO SAY THAT THE FIGURES ARE

APPALLING. WHILST THEY MAY BE SUBJECT TO EXAGGERATION, THERE

SHOULD BE NO DOUBTING THE PLIGHT OF THE ETHIOPIAN PEOPLE.

BUT ONE OF THE ETHIOPIAN PROVINCES, THE PRESENT C R I S I S

REFLECTS THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF THESE EVENTS. AS A RESULT

NEITHER THE PEOPLE NOR THE LAND HAVE BEEN ABLE TO BUILD UP

ANY MARGIN OF PROTECTION FROM -THE VAGARIES. OF CIRCUMSTANCE.

PROGRAM IS STRICTLY VOLUNTARY. EACH HOUSEHOLD WITH A FAMILY

OF F I V E  IS TO BE ALLOTTED TWO HECTARES. THE LAND IS TO BE

CLEARED AND I N I T I A L L Y  PLOUGHED BY THE GOVERNMENT. THE

RESETTLER IS ALSO TO BE PROVIDED ,WITH SHELTER, TOOLS AND

SEEDS. TO DATE, THE GOVERNMENT CLAIMS TO HAVE MOVED OVER

1 0 0 , 0 0 0  PEOPLE AS PART OF THIS PROGRAM. ,

The Et h i o p i a n  Go v e r n m e n t  has a t t a c h e d  c e n t r a l

IMPORTANCE TO THE SCHEME AND REQUESTED INTERNATIONAL

ASSISTANCE FOR ITS IMPLEMENTATION.

THE IDEA OF MOVING PEOPLE FROM INFERTILE AND DROUGHT

RAVAGED AREAS TO UNDER-UTILISED AND MORE PRODUCTIVE LAND '

WOULD AT FIRST GLANCE APPEAR SENSIBLE. THE GOVERNMENT STATES

THAT THE TARGET GROUPS ARE PEOPLE WITH A FARMING BACKGROUND

WHO HAVE EITHER BEEN DISPLACED BY VARIOUS DISASTERS, OR ARE

FROM DENSELY POPULATED AREAS. THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT

UNEMPLOYED URBAN DWELLERS AND NOMADS HAVE BEEN INCLUDED. THE

Go v e r n m e n t  p r o m i s e s  a b a s i c  pa c k a g e  of s e e d s > f e r t i l i z e r ,

und ue h a s t e . In AD DITIO N , STRETCHED TRANSPORTATION

' RESOURCES ARE BEING DIVERTED TO TRANSPORT PEOPLE AS

PART OF THE SCHEME. THERE ARE GRAVE DOUBTS ABOUT

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ THE ADEQUACY OF THE, SUPPLY OF SEED, TOOLS, FARM

. ANIMALS, AND SHELTER. NOR DOES THERE SEEM TO HAVE

BEEN MUCH ATTENTION GIVEN TO THE. PROVISI ON OF FOOD,

AS EVEN ON THE BEST ESTIMATE FOOD SELF RELIANCE

WILL BE A NUMBER OF YEARS AWAY.

-  16 -

2 . T here  are s e r io u s  m e d ic a l  problems  a s s o c ia t e d  w it h THE SCHEME. THE RESETTLEMENT AREAS ARE INFLICTED

BY DISEASES SUCH AS MALARIA, SLEEPING SICKNESS AND

, RIVER BLINDNESS. IN ADDITION TETSE FLY AFFECTS

LIVESTOCK.

The SETTLERS, COME FROM HIGHLAND AREAS WHERE THESE

DISEASES ARE NOT PREVALENT, AND, AS SUCH, ARE

UNLIKELY TO HAVE ESTABLISHED ANY RESISTANCE. NOR

DOES THERE SEEM TO HAVE BEEN ANY PROVISION MADE FOR

MEDICAL TREATMENT. IT  IS NOTEWORTHY THAT IN THE

MOST RECENT RRC REPORT DISCUSSING THE RESETTLEMENT

SCHEME, THERE IS NO MENTION OF MEDICAL PROBLEMS.

: 3 .  Th i r d l y , t h e r e see ms to h a v e b e e n no c o n s i d e r a t i o n

of c u l t u r a l  a s p e c t s . The m o v e m e n t  of h i g h l a n d

PEASANT COMMUNITIES, WITH A CLOSE A F F I N I T Y  TO THE IR

LAND, TO LOWLAND AREAS, MUST CAUSE PROBLEMS. THIS

IS PARTICULARLY SO FOR NOMADIC AND SEMI-NOMADIC

PASTORAL PEOPLE WHO ARE RESETTLED AND OBLIGED TO

BECOME AGRICULTURALISTS. Ã¢ÂÂ   ;

NATURE OF THE PROGRAMME. IT HAS BEEN ALLEGED THAT

- PEOPLE ARE RELUCTANT TO ENTER FEEDING CENTRES FOR

FEAR OF BEING OBLIGED TO RESETTLE.

Some o p p o n e n t s  of the scheme a l s o a t t a c k  t h e m o t i v e s

BEHIND THE RESETTLEMENT PROGRAM. THEY ARGUE THAT BY MOVING

PEOPLE FROM TI GRAY AND ERITREA, THE ETHIOPIAN GOVERNMENT IS

ATTEMPTING TO DILUTE SUPPORT FOR THE REBELS IN THESE

PROVINCES. I

I WAS UNABLE TO V I S I T  ANY OF THE RESETTLEMENT AREAS,

THOUGH I DID HAVE THE BENEFIT OF DISCUSSING THE MATTER WITH

PEOPLE WHO HAD. THE MOST STRIKING ASPECT OF THESE REPORTS

FROM OBSERVERS INVOLVES THE LACK OF PREPARATION IN THE

RESETTLEMENT SCHEME. T H I S ,  COMBINED WITH MY OWN OBSERVATION

OF THE HASTE WITH WHICH IT  IS BEING CARRIED OUT, LEADS ME TO

SERIOUSLY QUESTION THE WISDOM OF'THE SCHEME, AND ITS REAL

INTENT.

NATIONS MIGHT BECOME DISTRACTED BY NEW OCCURRENCES, AND THE

SEEMINGLY INTRACTABLE NATURE OF E T H I O P I A ' S  PROBLEMS. THE

LEVEL OF EMERGENCY FAMINE ASSISTANCE REQUIRED BY E T H I O P I A  .

NEEDS TO BE MAINTAINED AT PRESENT HIGH LEVELS FOR THE Ã¢ÂÂ  _

REMAINDER OF THIS YEAR. BUT THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT 1986

WILL BRING ABOUT ANY IMPROVEMENT IN THE S I T U A T I O N ,  AND MAY

ACTUALLY PROMISE A FURTHER DETERIORATION. .

THINK IT IS A CRISIS THE WEST CAN TURN ITS BACK ON. NOR IS

IT ONE THAT CAN BE APPROACHED IN A PIECE-MEAL FASHION. THE

FORMER APPROACH IS MORALLY UNACCEPTABLE WHILST THE LATTER

WOULD ONLY SERVE TO MAKE THE PROBLEMS INTERMINABLE.

Wh a t needs  to be u n d e r t a k e n  is a c o m p r e h e n s iv e  and

CO-ORDINATED DONOR APPROACH TO BOTH THE SHORT-TERM AND _

LONG-TERM PROBLEMS OF AFRICA. THE ULTIMATE GOAL MUST BE TO

return  Af r i c a  to food  s e l f - s u f f i c i e n c y . . ’

APPROACH SHOULD BE TAKEN IRRESPECTIVE OF THE PRESENT ACTIONS

of the Et h i o p i a n  Go v e r n m e n t . There  i s  no m e r i t  in i m p o s i n g  a

TRAGIC PENALTY ON A POPULATION WHICH HAS NO CHOICE IN ITS

THE D I S T R I B U T IO N  ASPECTS OF EMERGENCY RE LI EF  SUPPLIES. THERE

THE FOOD WILL NOT REACH MANY OF THE AFFECTED PEOPLE. T H IS IS

THE CASE IN E T H I O P I A .  PROVISION NEEDS TO BE MADE TO

STRENGTHEN'THE D I S T R I B U T IO N  APPARATUS OR, AT THE L E A S T ,  WHEN

FOOD A I D  IS PROVIDED THROUGH N G O ' S  OR MULTILATERAL

ORGANISATIONS, ENSURE THAT A COMPONENT IS INCLUDED TO COVER

THE COSTS OF D I S T R I B U T I O N . .

THE NEED FOR MEDICAL SUPPLIES AND MEDICAL PERSONNEL IS

PARAMOUNT. THE N G O ' S  HAVE BEEN LARGELY LEFT TO HANDLE '

HEALTH-CARE MATTERS. THEIR EXTRAORDINARY DEDICATION ONLY

PARTLY OVERCOMES THE FACT THAT THEY ARE HQPELESSLY

UNDERMANNED. DONORS NEED TO GIVE MORE ATTENTION TO TH IS -

FACET OF THE PROBLEM. '

IMPORTANCE. EMERGENCY RELIEF A I D  NEEDS TO BE CHANNELLED

THROUGH: THEM TO REACH THE REBEL PROVINCES. L I T T L E  RELIANCE

CAN BE PLACED ON THE ETHIOPIAN AUTHORITIES TO PROPERLY

ADDRESS THE SITU ATION IN THESE PROVINCES. PARTICULAR

ATTENTION NEEDS' ALSO TO BE PAID TO THE SUDAN WHICH IS

SUFFERING A SERIOUS REFUGEE PROBLEM AS A RESULT OF THE

SUCESSI ON I ST STRUGLES IN E T H I O P I A .  UNFORTUNATELY THE

L O G IS TI C A L D I F F I C U L T I E S  IN PROVIDING EMERGENCY A I D  THROUGH

THE "BACK DOOR" SERIOUSLY REDUCES ITS EFFECTIVENESS.

I BELIEVE I T  IS ALSO IMPOSSIBLE FOR WESTERN DONORS' TO

IGNORE THE ET HI OP IAN  GOVERNMENT’ S RESETTLEMENT PROGRAMMES.

WHETHER OR NOT THERE IS SOME CHANCE OF SUCCESS.

IN THE SPECIFIC CASE OF E T H I O P I A ,  I SEE NO POINT AT

The DIMENSIONS' OF what IS OCCURRING IN AFRICA NEED TO

BE RESPONDED TO, NOT IN AN AD HOC FASHION BUT IN "A

COMPREHENSIVE MANNER BY THE WEST. E T H IO P IA  NEEDS TO BE KEPT

IN CONTEXT AND SEEN AS ONE ELEMENT IN THE OVERALL PLIGHT

f a c i n g  Af r i c a . Such a c o m p r e h e n s i v e  a p p r o a c h  would a l s o

AVOID ANY CHARGE THAT THE WEST WAS REWARDING ITS ENEMIES AND

IGNORING FRIENDS.

Wh a t i s r e q u i r e d . i s for t h e We s t to t a k e up t h i s

CHALLENGE. TO F A C IL IT A T E  THIS IT  WOULD BE HELPFUL IF WESTERN

DONORS ESTABLISHED A NEW ORGANISATION, OR PREFERABLY, REFINED

AN EXISTING ONE, SUCH AS THE OECD, TO MONITOR AND ADVISE ON

DEVELOPMENTS IN AFRICA. THIS WOULD HOPEFULLY ENSURE A

CO-ORDINATED APPROACH BOTH TO SHORT-TERM EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE

AND LONG-TERM' DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE.
