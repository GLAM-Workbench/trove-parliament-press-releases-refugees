THE HON RICHARD MARLES MP  SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND  BORDER PROTECTION  MEMBER FOR CORIO

MEDIA RELEASE

IMMIGRATION MINISTER MUST COME CLEAN



The Immigration Minister Scott Morrison must come clean with the Australian  people and explain what he intends to do with the 153 asylum seekers currently  aboard an Australian customs vessel.



The Australian people deserve to know what is happening at sea under Mr  Morrison’s watch.



For Scott Morrison to cite operational protocol as a reason to avoid answering  basic questions is a farce.



Refusing to answer questions about the 153 people currently on board an  Australian customs vessel, Scott Morrison yesterday said:



“We have always maintained a very strong process for how we manage  communication regarding our operations.…As the Minister I’m going to adhere to  those protocols.”

The Minister had no hesitation in providing a detailed account of on water  operations to select media earlier this week.



He is routinely happy to ignore operational reasons when he wants to indulge in  self-congratulatory bluster.



It is clear Scott Morrison only answers the questions he wants asked. This is  absurd conduct on the part of the Immigration Minister.



Scott Morrison needs to be up front with the Australian people and explain what  plans he has for the 153 people currently aboard an Australian customs vessel.
