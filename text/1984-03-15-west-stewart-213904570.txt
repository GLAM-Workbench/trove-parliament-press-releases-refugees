DISCUSSIONS ON MIGRATION FROM VIETNAM

"Vietnam is committed to the continued development of the  Orderly Departure Program", the Hon Stewart West M P ,  Minister  for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs,  said today.

Mr West was commenting at the conclusion of his meeting  this afternoon with the Foreign Minister of Vietnam,  Mr Nguyen Co Thach. ,

The Orderly Departure Program is based on the reunion of  family from Vietnam and its continuation is an important  objective of the Australian Labor Government, the Minister  said.

During the discussions, the Foreign Minister agreed that  the Orderly Departure Program represented a humane and  sensible option to the risks faced by people attempting to  leave Vietnam by boat. Mr Thach commented that more people  now left Vietnam under Orderly Departure arrangements than  by boat.

Noting Mr Thach's endorsement of the future development of  the program, the Minister said he believed that over time the  program would become a routine migration movement.

The Minister noted Mr Thach1s comment that there was now  no real justification for people to leave Vietnam by boat.

Mr West shared the Foreign Minister's view that there was  a need to look for alternatives to large scale resettlement  of the people leaving Vietnam and the other countries of  Indo-China,  and welcomed his support for Australia's  initiatives on voluntary repatriation.

The Minister said that it was the view of the Government that  these were important issues for resolution. He said he  proposed to continue his efforts on voluntary repatriation  in consultation with the United Nations High Commissioner for  Refugees, Mr Poul Hartling.

Mr West said the discussions this afternoon were most helpful  and represented a useful development of the dialogue with the  Government of Vietnam.
