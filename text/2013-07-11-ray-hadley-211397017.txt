E and OE

HADLEY:

In the studio with me now is the Shadow Immigration spokesman Scott Morrison.   G’day Scott.

MORRISON:

G’day Ray, good to be here.

HADLEY:

Nice to be with you as well.  Now you and I talk regularly about boats and what you’ll  be able to do if in fact you are the Immigration Minister later this year.  There are two  things that are growing under the Gillard-Rudd government.  Debt and illegal boat  arrivals.  Now I’ve got a table here in front of me that shows during term one of their  government 7,403 people arrived illegally.  Term two, 39,137 as of earlier this week.   What’s the projected term three if they’re re-elected on the growth that we’ve had in  terms one and two, what are they projecting?

MORRISON:

109,000 which is enough to fill the MCG and that’s based on our current rate of  arrivals over the last 100 days.  And it’s interesting to compare Ray, you go back - if  I’d told you at the last election that 40,000 people were going to turn up after 7,500  people turned up the first time I think even you would have doubted me and others  would but that’s exactly what has happened.  And if we’d just gone off the rate of  arrivals at the last election then we would have only expected 25,000 to turn up so  this projection is just simply based on if they keep coming at this rate under Kevin

Rudd, what will happen next term well 109,000 people will turn up which is enough to  fill the MCG in one term.



HADLEY:

See and people see hang on, that’s alarmist 109,000 people.  But it’s not.  We’re  already up to almost 15,000 and we’re not for the end of July.  Last year was a  record 17,200.  And even allowing for the new Prime Minister going to meet with the  Indonesian President, nothing came of it.



MORRISON:

They don’t have a policy.  I heard you had Tony Burke on earlier in the week.  They  don’t have a policy.  Their policy is to get on a plane and go to a conference and  talk.  That’s it.  So when the Prime Minister is at the Press Club today I think the  obvious question is what is your policy on border protection?  It’s not Malaysia,  they’ve junked that, and to the extent they’re still talking about it they don’t have an  agreement with anybody to implement it.  So if Kevin Rudd is re-elected then what  happens the next day?  I can tell you what happens the next day, he just keeps  talking.  That’s all that will happen. Now the contrast with the Coalition is everyone  knows what we will do.  Temporary protection visas come back in, genuine offshore  processing happens again, we turn boats back where it is safe to do so.  People who  throw their documents away they won’t be in the queue, they won’t be at the back of  the queue, they won’t be in the queue at all because that’s the Coalition’s policy so  that’s a pretty clear set of actions.



HADLEY:

Now Tony Burke didn’t say to me but he said the next day - I think Tuesday, he was  on the program on Monday - that this farce that’s called the Malaysian solution was  a regional approach.  How’s that regional?  If it’s 4000 people coming from one  country and accepting 800 from this country, how is that regional?  How does that  include all the other nations in the region?



MORRISON:

Exactly.  It was a bilateral arrangement between two countries.  800 was never  enough.  A five for one deal was never a good deal for Australia and to pretend now  that we won’t go ahead with it because 800 isn’t enough now.  Well it was only good  for 12 boats then, it’s only good for less than that even now and was never an  answer.  So they have no policy in place now Ray and the other thing is the budget  now this year is based on 1,100 people turning up every month and we are already  at a situation now where we have eclipsed the budgeted arrivals for this year within  10 days of the year starting.  So the budget will continue to blowout under this  government at a record rate because we are running well over their projected  arrivals and Chris Bowen should know.  Chris Bowen was the one who saw these  arrivals skyrocket under his term as Immigration Minister.  Now as Treasurer he’s got  this fantasy going where he thinks they’re going to fall by two thirds and they clearly  haven’t.  They’re running at record rates.



HADLEY:

OK.  Let’s go back to last Friday.  I wasn’t here but this was something I listened to  for the first time on Monday, I think it was Tony Eastley AM on the ABC.  It’s a  discussion with the Chief of Navy, or the former Chief of Navy back in the days when  John Howard addressed the situation.  I think I’m right in saying 2001 5,516 people  arrived so the then Prime Minister said we need to change this, we need to do  something.  Let’s have a listen to what was said.



EASTLEY:

So you take the boat back and just leave it there do you or do you actually take it to  a port?



RICTHIE:

We would take it back and we would observe it from below the horizon if you like on  radar and things like that.



EASTLEY:

What guarantee was it that it was going to continue the way it was headed and that  was back to Indonesian waters?  What was to stop it coming back again?

RITCHIE:  We took the fuel out of it so that it couldn’t come back again.



EASTLEY:

With those boats you would work out your fuel and your distances and would give  them just enough fuel to get back to Indonesian ports.



RITCHIE:

We’ve give them just enough - well give them enough with a margin of safety to get  back to safe haven and many of them, there were only four that were successfully  returned out of the twelve.  They did it a bit.  You could see that they‘d go round in  circles, they might attempt to follow us but in the end they’d turn back. And I think in  the end common sense and the safety of the crew and the passengers on board  prevails and they know that’s what they have to do.



EASTLEY:

Why did the practise stop when it did?



RITCHIE:

No more boats came.



EASTLEY:

None at all?



RITCHIE:  None at all.  None at all.



EASTLEY:

If that same model of returning boats was to be reinstituted today, do you think it  would still work?



RITCHIE:

If the conditions were replicated, it could still work.

HADLEY:

Tony Eastley nice man that he is sounds almost stunned there.



MORRISON:

I think he was and I think that was a fairly unequivocal statement from Vice Admiral  Ritchie -



HADLEY:  They stopped coming.



MORRISON:

They stopped coming.  And then we’ve had Major General Molan who’s said  something similar, we’ve had Brigadier Hogan say something similar.  The real  difference here Ray is that this government doesn’t want to turn boats back, they  don’t want to stop boats coming to Australia.  When the boats come towards  Australia they don’t even say to them look you really shouldn’t be coming, you  should be going back the other way, they just pick them up, put them on the water  taxi and take them to Australia.  Now what does all this mean going forward?  Kevin  Rudd likes to talk about the future.  Well what it means is that at this election we  have this last opportunity potentially to get this right because if we go to 109,000 in  the next term of a Labor government if they’re re-elected well that is really  completely out of control.  It already is out of control but that’s a whole new level.  So  there is the opportunity at this election to get that right for the last time potentially.



HADLEY:

Mary says tell Mr Morrison the Labor Party does have a platform; it’s called open  borders.



MORRISON:

That’s it.  I understand Kevin Rudd wants to debate these things but you can’t  debate asylum and border protection policy when you don’t have one.  And Kevin  Rudd doesn’t have a policy.



HADLEY:

There was a story published on June 26 in the Australian by Paul Maley and Sean  Parnell which is really worrying.  Unaccompanied minors on asylum seeker boats are  arriving with high rates of sexually transmitted diseases.  The only conclusion you  can draw is that these young people, mainly young men I suspect, are being treated  as some sort of sexual play thing by other people either in their home country, in  Indonesia or on these vessels on the way out here.  You know so you make the point  that we always make here, the papers go overboard, we don’t know if it’s Ook  Maglook or who it is and I’m not overstating it.  If there is a disproportionate number  of young people arriving here with sexually transmitted diseases the inference is that  there are men who are paedophiles who are arriving here also without papers.



MORRISON:

We have no idea who’s coming as you’ve just said and the risk particularly for young  people and minors coming along this journey is significant.  I think that point just  makes itself Ray.  That’s why it’s important also that where we believe crimes may  have been committed on these boats and things like that then the NSW Police in  particular has got to have access, they’ve got to have access to investigate these  crimes or any other state police where they may be and indeed the Federal police  but I haven’t seen any advance on those things.



HADLEY:

Now the other aspect of all of this is that despite the fact he’s been around the planet  more times than Yuri Gagarin over the past two weeks, the Prime Minister and he’s  had a trip there, there’s not been one question.  The media surprised me - well I  shouldn’t be surprised, I guess I’m part of it - there’s not been one question about  now you’ve had that discussion, now that the boats just keep coming and I’ve got my  list here  and I go through it every day for the benefit of my listeners because they  get it hardly anywhere else.  14,462 as of 9 July, 210 boats this year, 13 this month,  1115, they’ve budgeted I think what for 1100?



MORRISON:

1100 a month and we’ve already passed it within the first 10 days.



HADLEY:

But no one talks to the Prime Minister.  No one says Prime Minister the single  biggest problem confronting Australia today and I’ve been talking about it since 2007  basically - MORRISON:

You have.



HADLEY:

After the policies were changed.  I said before 2007 watch them come now if Kevin  Rudd enacts the laws he wishes to enact and it’s prophetic.  14,462 so far this year;  17,200 last year.  You’re projecting 109,000 if they’re returned to government.   But  no one asks him about it and says what are you going to do about it?



MORRISON:

He’s been let off scot free on this particular point and that is was he wrong or was he  right to change the policies that worked under John Howard when he rolled out the  Rudd carpet to people smugglers and what he’s said is well I was to slow to act in  2009.  No Prime Minister.  What you did in 2007 and 2008 is the real issue here and  I notice Tony Burke wouldn’t address that issue either when he was on the program  the other day. This government has not taken responsibility and this Prime Minister  has not taken responsibility for his decision to abolish the proven measures of John  Howard that worked and taxpayers are paying the price for that decision.  We  revealed yesterday there was the $2.5 billion cost now to Serco.  That was a tenth of  that when this Prime Minister was first elected to office.  These costs go on.  $10.3  billion.  That is the price that Australians are paying for Kevin Rudd’s decision back  in 2007 and 2008 when he got rid of temporary protection visas, when he got rid of  the Pacific solution and when he turned back on his own promise to turn back boats.   So that is his responsibility, it is for him to take responsibility for that and until he  does, then he is just all talk.



HADLEY:

There’s one final thing.  The message has gone out to Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan,  Pakistan, Sri Lanka that we’re an easy target.  A boat full of Sudanese were taken  back to Indonesia by I believe authorities recently but another boat load were met by  Australian authorities I think with 101 people on board.  Sudanese men.  So the  message has gone to the Sudan now.



MORRISON:

That’s right.  And Vietnam and far and wide.  We’re seeing an increasing cross  section of different nationalities and others coming on vessels because they know  Kevin’s here and they know he’s a soft touch.  They know Labor’s a soft touch.   Labor is actually the pull factor for these boats it goes well beyond just their policy  failures.  They’re coming here because Kevin’s here and Kevin’s running the show.



HADLEY:

And the other thing about it is there’s no crew on this boat with the Sudanese.   They’ve given them a Navman or a GPS and said do your best.



MORRISON:

And that means the voyages are getting even more risky than they were before and  one of the key motivations I think for all of us who want to see this madness come to  an end is we want to stop people dying at sea.



HADLEY:

OK.  What I want to do is set aside some time and I make the offer to Tony Burke as  well for listeners who send me any number of emails and I get dozens every day  about this same issue to set aside in one program 40 minutes if necessary or longer  for you to confront callers who’ll have opposing views in many cases to your view

and my view - and also the same invitation to the Minister himself to take calls from  people and answer their questions and it will become even more important the closer  we get to the election.  Have you a gut feeling for when we’ll go to the polls?



MORRISON:

No I don’t.  Kevin always thinks the answer to his problems and the country’s  problems is more Kevin so I suspect that he will keep things drawing out for a while.   He’s quite impressed with himself I notice lately so he probably wants to give the  country more Kevin between now and the election.  I don’t think the country is  interested in that.  I think we should go to an election because we’ve had the  Malaysia solution, the East Timor solution, that’s all failed.  What we need now is the  election solution on border protection and if we have that then Australians can finally  decide to get the right policies back on our borders but look Ray I’d be happy to do  that anytime as you know, we’ve taken calls many times on this program and others.



HADLEY:

Just one final thing.  You’re younger than me and I know that social media’s an  attraction to politicians because it’s an attempt to get to a wide range of people of  different demographics.  In my twilight years I’ll resist any attempt to go on social  media you won’t find me tweeting on twitter or facebooking on Facebook or going on  Instagram I think it’s called. But you see because I’ve got teenage children selfies  are a big part of our language.  You know, Dad take a selfie.  No, I refuse to take one  so they take photos of me and then put them on places and say here’s dad taking a  selfie of himself, you know.



MORRISON:

Yes.



HADLEY:

For the uninitiated, selfie means when you hold the smart phone in front of you and  take a photo of yourself and post it.  Given that like every other man you shave at  least once a day, some men are forced to shave twice a day because of the nature  of their beards, have you ever found the need to take a selfie of yourself after you’ve  made many of those cuts as I made - see that on my cheek?  That happened this  morning at about twenty to four, I think from memory .  I’ve never found the need to  take a selfie and tell anyone, either my immediate family or people who have no idea  about me, look what I just did.



MORRISON:

It’s frankly just a bit creepy, I’ve got to say.  When I saw that in the Telegraph today  that was my initial reaction but I think it shows a Prime Minister who is obsessed with  himself and I think he thinks the nation is as obsessed with him as he is.



HADLEY:

Well if you read some of the sycophantic posts that were put on it you’d see why  he’d think that because his adoring fans said oh isn’t it wonderful, just a normal  bloke.  He cut himself shaving.  Hello!



MORRISON:

It happens.



HADLEY:  To everyone.  Thanks for your time Scott.



MORRISON:  Thanks a lot Ray good to be here.



HADLEY:
