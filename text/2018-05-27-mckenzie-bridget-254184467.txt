Communities continue to benefit from Local Drug Action Teams

The Coalition Government is continuing to take action to combat the scourge of ice and other illicit  drugs with more Local Drug Action Teams set to rollout across Australia.

The outcome of the third round of the highly successful program, which is part of the $298 million  National Ice Action Strategy, was announced by Minister for Rural Health, Senator Bridget  McKenzie today in Darwin.

Minister McKenzie said a further 92 LDATs have joined the program for round three, bringing the  total number to 172 LDATs across Australia.

“I want to congratulate the 92 successful LDATs for their commitment to reducing the impact of  drug misuse in their communities,” Minister McKenzie said.

“The success of the program is clear and this further funding will allow more communities to build  on work done in earlier rounds with initiatives such as working with vulnerable people to improve  education and employment opportunities and providing support and information to families about  issues such as alcohol and drug abuse.”

The LDAT program brings communities together to develop local plans and activities to prevent  and reduce the harm being caused by drugs and alcohol in their regions.

LDAT members often include representatives from local councils, schools, police, youth services,  primary health services and treatment services, community groups, non-government organisations.

Minister McKenzie welcomes this latest round of LDATs acknowledging that regional communities  are often the hardest hit when it comes to epidemics such as ‘ice’ addiction.

“Our regional communities are working hard to establish and implement preventive and support  services and this latest round of LDATs are assisting communities further.

This latest measure is part of the Coalition Government’s $298 million National Ice Action Strategy  to combat illicit drug and alcohol use.

The National Ice Taskforce recognised that taking action at the local level and building community  engagement and capacity is vital to reducing the harms that alcohol and other drugs have on  individuals, families and communities.

Successful applicants will initially receive $10,000 to help them to develop a local action plan.  Once the plan is finalised, LDATs can apply to receive up to an additional $30,000 in their first year  (and then $40,000 a year) to support delivery of local activities.





“The Coalition Government is committed to combating the scourge of ice and we encourage more  organisations to apply to join the LDAT program, to drive change at a local level,” Minister  McKenzie said.
