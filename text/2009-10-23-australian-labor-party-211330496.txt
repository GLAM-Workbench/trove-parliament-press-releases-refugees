DOORSTOP INTERVIEW

CANBERRA

23 OCTOBER 2009

SUBJECTS: Treasurer's meeting; housing supply; States clawing back pension  increase; stimulus spending on infrastructure; Malcolm Turnbull's leadership

TREASURER:

We had a very useful meeting with State Treasurers this morning. We had a very good  discussion about our investments in Nation Building infrastructure and, in particular, the  investment in the school modernisation program, and social housing, the importance of that  stimulus infrastructure investment, to supporting jobs and to supporting small businesses  right across Australia. And I think all Ministers agreed that this was very important, very  timely and certainly is required as we move forward. So that was a very good discussion.

We also had a broader discussion about the economy. I gave them a detailed briefing on the  economy, where we've been, outlook for the future.

And we also had a very long discussion about housing supply issues, because I think most  people are aware that, in terms of our population growth we're simply not building enough  houses and we've got to do more in terms of the supply of housing in our community as we  move forward through to economic recovery and into the future. And to that end Minister  Plibersek came along as well - the Housing Minister - and we had a good discussion about  all of those issues.

In addition to that we agreed to further progress a national uniform system of trade  licensing. This is very important so that tradies can move from State to State. The States  agreed to fund that system and we agreed to set up a special advisory committee to further  increase that important work. This is very important for labour mobility in our community,  and it is also part of making sure we put in place that seamless national economy that's so  important as we go forward. So that's a bit of a summary of the things we discussed this  morning. I'm happy to answer any of your questions.

JOURNALIST:

What conclusions did you reach on the housing crisis? And how are you going to increase  supply?

TREASURER:

Well, we had a long discussion about what must be done and agreed that we would  progress these issues through our Housing Ministers. We, of course, did review the progress  that we've made through our very substantial investment in social housing through  economic stimulus. That's been important and that investment is on track. Our Housing

Minister took the opportunity to talk to the State Treasurers about the importance of our  National Rental Affordability Scheme, what might be done to get more private sector  investment involved there with both state and Commonwealth investment - that's been very

important. There was a discussion about various models - and it proved effective - around  Australia in terms of social housing. There was also a discussion about the availability, or  unavailability of finance for some forms of multi-unit dwelling. A discussion about where we  might go and what more could be done in terms of development approvals. All of these  things go to the core of housing supply. I think it's pretty important, and the  Commonwealth has this view that we've got to get ahead of the curve here. We have not  been building enough houses, we do have strong population growth. So it will be very  important as we move through to economic recovery to ensure that we don't have capacity  constraints that flow from a shortage of houses. And, indeed that's why we put significant  resources into social housing as part of our stimulus plan - not just to create jobs for now,  not just to support small business for now, but also to leave a lasting legacy of more  affordable housing, which is absolutely essential to our economic prosperity into the future.

JOURNALIST:

Can you give a firm commitment that, that social housing program will not be cut again?

TREASURER:

The social housing program is part of the core stimulus that we've put in place. And as you  are aware, and we had a discussion about this this morning, the stimulus peaked in June.  The cash payments were still in the system but are starting to fade out and, of course,

some of the other measures that we've put in are starting to fade out and as we go through  next year the stimulus is gradually withdrawn and it detracts from growth. But an essential  part of that stimulus as we move forward is that substantial investment in social housing, is  that substantial investment when it comes to our school modernisation program. And both  those programs are providing essential support to the construction sector which has been  very badly hit by a downturn more broadly, particularly in commercial property.

JOURNALIST:

Did you press the states in terms of the pension increase and what they might be clawing  back by rental increases for pensioners?

TREASURER:

Look we had a pretty robust discussion about this issue. I feel very strongly about this  issue. This pension increase has been hard earned and hard won by Australian pensioners  and there is simply no way the Commonwealth will tolerate a clawback of that one-off

pension increase by the states, for pensioners in public housing. Now some states agreed  with the Commonwealth position and some states did not. But discussions will continue.

JOURNALIST:

Which ones don't?

TREASURER:

Well, I'll leave that up to the states - to self identify.

JOURNALIST:

Are you disappointed that you weren't able to get a uniform agreement on that today?

TREASURER:

Well, as you know there is already an agreement that the current arrangements will stay in  place for 12 months. So there's not an urgency in terms of anything that is happening right  now. But I made it very clear, absolutely crystal clear that the Commonwealth will not  tolerate any claw back of that base rate pension increase by states for pensioners in public

housing. Very clear.

JOURNALIST:

You're asking really for a separate set of rules for pensioners than other people in public  housing.

TREASURER:

No I'm not. I've been familiar with this issue for a very long period of time and the fact is  that there have been indexation arrangements in place for pensioners and others in public  housing for a long period of time. What some states are proposing is to take a far bigger  share of that base rate increase than normal indexation and the Commonwealth will not  tolerate that.

JOURNALIST:

What will you do about it?

TREASURER:

Well, we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. As I said, we've got some time to sort it  out. Some states in the room this morning, supported a Commonwealth position and I  thank them for that, and some states did not.

JOURNALIST:

Mr Swan did you discuss how the states are spending their stimulus money on infrastructure  projects?

TREASURER:

Yes we did. We had a lengthy discussion about the importance of our stimulus infrastructure  investment. As you know, some 70 per cent of our stimulus is invested in infrastructure, in  shovel ready projects which are going on around the country - tens of thousands of projects  in schools, in social housing. These are very important. It's a pipeline of work that has given  the business community in this country confidence. And when you look at the sort of data  we are getting on the economy you can see how important this stimulus is to future  economic growth and to confidence more broadly in our economy.

JOURNALIST:

But is there concern that the states aren't choosing the right projects?

TREASURER:

I think that when it comes to both social housing and the school modernisation program the

stimulus has been implemented, and has implemented within the guidelines that we have  outlined, and it is largely meeting the timeframes that we've set as well. And that's a good  thing because that's why we are getting some of the economic results that we're getting  now, because the Government put in place a timely stimulus, put in place a targeted  stimulus. The consequence of that is that growth is much stronger than it would have  otherwise been. I remind you that in the year through to June growth would have been  negative by -1.3 per cent if it wasn't for our economic stimulus. It was positive by 0.6 per  cent in that year because of our economic stimulus. And it remains important to recovery as

we move through the rest of this year and through next year.

JOURNALIST:

On asylum seekers, more Liberals have supported Wilson Tuckey's views. Do you think this  is now becoming a question of Malcolm Turnbull's leadership? Is it weakening his  leadership?

TREASURER:

There's no doubt that Malcolm Turnbull is a weak leader, and you've seen it on display in a  whole range of issues - climate change, economic policy - you name it.
