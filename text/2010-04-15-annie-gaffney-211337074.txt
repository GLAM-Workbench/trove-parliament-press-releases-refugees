E&OE………………………………………………………………………………………

GAFFNEY:

Joe Hockey, welcome to the Coast.

JOE HOCKEY:

Great to be here Annie, thank you for having me.

GAFFNEY:

Do you get up to the Coast very often?

JOE HOCKEY:

Well in fact, I confess I actually spent Easter with the family up here.

GAFFNEY:

Did you? Where abouts did you go?

JOE HOCKEY:

We stayed in Coolum - they actually stayed a lot longer and for me it was sort of in  and out for work but it was really special.  You’ve got a great part of the Earth here.

GAFFNEY:

Well we’d agree with you there.  Did you get into the surf?  Are you a body surfer?

JOE HOCKEY:

Let’s not go with this where I think it might go here!  Talking about birds and  smuggling etc.

GAFFNEY:

Well actually I do have to ask you that question.  If you get into the surf, what’s your  preferred swimming attire?

JOE HOCKEY:

Top-to-toe.  Sun smart, that’s right.  I love the beach and the kids loved it too.  We’ve  got three children under five so they just had a ball.  Coolum is a lovely beach isn’t  it?

GAFFNEY:

It is.  Now we’ve been asking our listeners to give us a call throughout the course of  our chat this morning if they’ve got some questions they would like to put to you.   We’ve already had a couple come in this morning.

We’ll start with a bit of an unusual one from a listener who posted this online  yesterday and Michelle says:  what are you going to do about taxing cigarettes  further if you get into government?  I’ve got private health insurance. I eat healthily.   I’m a smoker and I love smoking.  I don’t take drugs, I don’t drink and I barely swear.   I don’t even have sex anymore.  Leave my cigarettes alone.  Over-taxing cigarettes  is targeting a minority.  It would be better to make a bag of sugar cost $20.  Much  more egalitarian.

There’s been a lot of discussion of course about this since the announcement  yesterday that cigarettes could go up over the next few years under the Rudd  government.  How do you feel about cigarettes, particularly given we’re undergoing a  pretty major health reform at the moment?

JOE HOCKEY:

Well we came up with a specific plan last year that would see maintenance of  appropriate private health insurance cover and the payoff for that would be an  increase in tobacco tax.  Now the government rejected that proposal.  So from our  perspective we want to see what the total tax take is and how it is going to be  applied.

Traditionally taxes on cigarettes have been applied partly as a revenue raiser by  governments, but really it was about increasing the price of cigarettes to dissuade  people from smoking.

There is a certain price point you get to, arguably, where you may not necessarily  get fewer people smoking the more you increase the cost, therefore it becomes a  revenue raiser.  Now I’m not sure what that point is off the top of my head but what I  do is that the government has to explain to the Australian people where all the  money is going to come from for everything that it is promising.

That’s our contention.  There is this review of taxation under Ken Henry that the  government’s been sitting on since before Christmas which outlines a 10-year plan

apparently for tax but no one’s seen this plan yet and yet the Prime Minister is  spending a lot of money

GAFFNEY:

[inaudible] …the latest OECD report said that Australia is in fact one of the lowest-taxed nations in the developed world.  What would you like to see happen in the way  of tax reform in this country?

JOE HOCKEY:

Well we believe in lower taxes and fairer taxes.  This is going to be the opportunity  for enterprise - these years ahead.  We live in the fastest growing region in the  world.  Often when it comes to things like tax we compare ourselves with European  countries and the United States but the fact is that Asia is very low taxing, as is the  Middle East.

In many areas such as financial services, they are our competition and we need to  be low-taxing to compete.  Kevin Rudd and Wayne Swan used to keep saying that  we were the biggest taxing government in Australian history.  Well that’s just dead  wrong.

The danger is, if you keep spending money then you have to raise tax and I think this  is going to be a worldwide trend in some of the developed world.  Governments are  going to start increasing taxes and we’ve got to resist the pressure to lock-in  increased taxes because ultimately it stifles business.

GAFFNEY:

We had another listener call in earlier this morning with a question for you and she  says:  in terms of the Liberal Party and coming up to the election later this year, can  you please do a campaign on policies rather than just getting into a slanging match  with the government.  Your policies are getting obscured and we’re not sure what  they are anymore.

JOE HOCKEY:

Well I would say that an Opposition has a role to play in raising issues.  Now if we  hadn’t have raised issues like the pink batt waste or if we hadn’t have raised issues  like the waste in the $16 billion school program, then people wouldn’t have heard  about it. We’ve been working with a lot of other people in raising these issues.

If we hadn’t have kept reminding Kevin Rudd of his promise on health to fix the  hospitals by the middle of last year, he wouldn’t have done anything by now.  So it is  our role as a critic but also as an alternate government and we have rolled out some  policies.  We will be rolling out more policies.  By election time I think your listener  will be absolutely convinced of what our policies are.

GAFFNEY:

We’ve got a lot of questions coming in Mr Hockey.  Liz from Noosa says: a  suggestion - instead of a baby bonus and the first home owners grant, she would  like the people who earn less that $80,000 a year to be able to claim the interest on  the first $200,000 of their mortgage as a tax deduction.  How would that idea sit with  you?

JOE HOCKEY:

Well it’s worth looking at isn’t it?  I think mortgage costs are a huge issue, but  housing affordability is a huge issue and I look at it here on the Coast and I can’t  believe the cost of houses.  I was really surprised at the cost of housing and the  massive expansion in housing.

The bottom line is, it comes back down to this debate about population and what is  the right population.  I think the right population is not a number, the right population  is to maintain or improve our quality of life.

GAFFNEY:

Can we do that with a bigger population? [inaudible] …particularly after those  remarks.  He’s even gone as far as appointing a Population Minster.  What is your  take?  I mean, you’ve said it’s about quality of life.  A lot of people have said the  more people we have, the less our quality of life.

JOE HOCKEY:

I’m not a believer in bringing in people and then building the infrastructure.  I think  you have to build the infrastructure first because that delivers the quality of life and  then you grow to support that infrastructure.

It’s a chicken and egg argument and the Coast here, which I’ve watched over many  years, is a classic example.  People come and then they say: well where is the  infrastructure to support those people?  The better roads, the transport, hospitals.  I  know they are bursting up here.  Alex Somlyay was telling me on the way here about  the local hospital.

This is the basic infrastructure that is needed when you grow a population.  So it’s no  use continuing to grow the population and saying we’ll back-fill the infrastructure  because the quality of life of those people is diminished until that infrastructure kicks  in.  So I would say, build the infrastructure first and then you can have a bigger  population.

GAFFNEY:

Well part of this argument… [inaudible] …is reducing the level of our immigration and  perhaps increasing the number of refugee asylum seekers that we take into this  country on humanitarian grounds and nix the level of immigration at least by half  because that is putting pressure on our quality of lifestyle and creating this need for  more infrastructure.  What would be Opposition’s stance on immigration be into the  future?

JOE HOCKEY:

Well we’ll be releasing our immigration policy in the not too distant future but it will be  focused on the best interests of the Australian people and not simply a number.   Now, you can have your ratios - that is, the number of refugees versus the number  of skilled migrants and family reunions and so on.

Australia has always been, appropriately, a very generous nation for refugees and  we should be.  But we want genuine refugees, not people who are going to be  trafficked here by former drug traffickers that are now in the business of human  trafficking.  That’s why we take a very firm stand in the Coalition against the boats  coming here.

Now about 12,000 refugees come to Australia every year.  Every boat that arrives, if  those people are accepted into Australia they displace the 12,000 who didn’t have  the money to come here.  Who didn’t have the money to pay people traffickers.  I  think as a compassionate nation we have got to get that right.  We’ve got to fix it.

In terms of general migration, I am the son of a migrant.  I spoke to 200-250 people  on the Coast here this morning and told a bit of the family story about my family  coming to Australia and setting up a delicatessen.  My mother, who comes from a  long Australian history was told not to go and speak to the wog at the local corner  store… and she ended up marrying him. So that’s a story that many Australians are  quite familiar with.

That’s the beauty of our country.  That’s why we are a great country.  We’ve got to  get it right but as soon as Kevin Rudd makes it a political issue on this sort of scale -  appointing a Population Minister, weakening our border protection policies and so on  - it starts to undermine public confidence in the immigration system and I want a  strong immigration system that has to be based on strong border protection.

GAFFNEY:

[inaudible] …what got you into politics in the first place?  Did you have a calling or  was it the benefits and the pension scheme?  And what did you want to achieve?

JOE HOCKEY:

It is a calling.  It has to be a calling.  It’s very hard to put up with everything in politics  if it’s not a calling. If it’s not a vocation.  I feel this great burden of debt to my nation.   I worked as a banking and finance lawyer and in truth, today I’m earning less than  the day I walked into Parliament 14 years ago when I was working as a banking and  finance lawyer.

It’s not the remuneration I can promise you that.  It is my desire to make my country  better.  To give, now, my children a better quality of life and a better opportunity in  life than I’ve had - and that’s saying something.

Again it’s a country that embraced my family, my father who came as a migrant in  1948. I feel a great debt to this country for being so welcoming to my family  otherwise I may well be living in a refugee camp in Gaza as the son of a Palestinian.

GAFFNEY:

You said last week on radio that you would get out of politics if your wife strongly  suggested to you that the family relationship couldn’t sustain your political career any  longer.  But how did you feel last week about Malcolm Turnbull’s news - he tweeted  it - that he will be leaving politics after the next federal election?

JOE HOCKEY:

Well my comment was directed at the fact that I’ve got a young family and if your  family doesn’t support you in politics, if you are working against your family in staying  in politics then there’s an end point.   It’s too big a job, there are too many pressures  to be in a position where you work against your family and still do an adequate job in  politics.

So, that’s right.  If Melissa said to me, it’s in the best interest of the children and the  family, it’s time.  I would say, I understand that.  I’ve made a good contribution.  I’ve  done everything I can for my nation even though I’ve got a lot of unfinished business  - and I do.  We as a team, as a family have a collective desire to make the country  better and I am determined - absolutely determined - to continue to make a big  contribution to Australia.

GAFFNEY:

Now I’d like to talk about your unfinished business in just a moment but you didn’t  address my question about Malcolm Turnbull…

JOE HOCKEY:

Sorry - look Malcolm had a unbelievably successful political career in such a short  period of time.  He started in his mid-fifties, he would only have hung around to be  the Leader effectively.  I mean, once you’re the Leader and you lose the opportunity,  if you lose that position, it’s very hard to come back and not want to be the Leader  again.  Simon Crean is one of the few exceptions.  So he just said, well I’ve got  plenty of other things to do in my life.  I really genuinely hope that Malcolm continues  to make a contribution to public life.

GAFFNEY:

Would you consider another leadership challenge?

JOE HOCKEY:

Well I didn’t challenge.  The leadership was vacant because the spill motion had  been carried.

GAFFNEY:

Sure, but are you going to stick your hand up in the future?

JOE HOCKEY:

Well the end of last year wasn’t my time.  I don’t when my time will come or if it will  come again but what I do know is that for my country and for my family, I’ve got a lot  of work to do in politics.

GAFFNEY:

About that, what are your ambitions?  What do you want to achieve?

JOE HOCKEY:

Well I want to see Australia get back on the rails.  I want to see us not squander this  wonderful opportunity we have going forward.

We are blessed as a nation.  For all of our history as a modern nation our barrier to  growth has been our distance from the rest of the world.  We’ve been seen as the  ‘country down under’ - too far away to do business.  Now we as a nation - because  of the Internet, because of mobile phone technology - we are as close to other  people on the other side of the world as if we were standing right next to them.  This  provides a world of opportunity for our country and this generation - the living  generation of Australians today - have the world at their feet.

We’re in the fastest growing region of the world in Asia - a massive shift for Australia  from being Euro-centric and Amero-centric to Asia-centric.  That’s a big shift, a big  shift in opportunity.  Quite frankly, I’m very excited about the prospects for my  country but we can blow it.  We can blow it by having a government that spends too  much money, that is reckless with taxpayer’s money, that borrows too much money  and saddles future generations with debt, all because they spend money on pink  batts and flawed school halls and didn’t put it into the infrastructure that is going to  make us a better country.

GAFFNEY:

We have time for one more question, this one comes from Max at Kawana: will Joe  admit that the carbon tax is more about tax than the environment because if  Australia was to switch off all power, we would make no difference to the  environment pollution-wise as we are small fry.  We’d be penalising our industries  when no other country is doing this.

JOE HOCKEY:

I think that’s a reference to the emissions trading scheme debate.  This is Kevin  Rudd’s problem.  He has not explained to the Australian people exactly what he  expects to deliver with his emissions trading scheme and the impact it is going to  have on families.

I am of the very strong view that there are externalities in this world that we need to  all work together to control and one of them is carbon emissions leading to climate  change.  I believe in climate change.  I believe carbon emissions do contribute to  climate change, human activity does.  Let’s do something about it.  But Australia  acting alone - as would be the case after Copenhagen - would be a disaster for our  country and would have no material impact on the planet.

GAFFNEY:

Joe Hockey, one final question from me this morning.  Tony Abbott’s been copping a  lot of flack for his continued obsession with all things fitness.   I’d imagine when you  all get together he’s got you down on the floor doing crunches and sit ups.  Is it hard  to be around someone so unashamedly fit?

JOE HOCKEY:

Well no, my wife used to run for NSW for 15 years so now I’ve just got it at work as  well as at home.  I’ve got used to it.  I’ve got used to my body.  I am what I am.  I’ve  just got to live with that and try the best I can in different ways.

GAFFNEY:

Joe Hockey, thanks for coming in and making some time for us this morning on ABC  Coast FM.

JOE HOCKEY:

Anytime, thank you very much.
