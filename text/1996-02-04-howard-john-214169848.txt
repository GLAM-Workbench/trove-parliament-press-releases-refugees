JOURNALIST:

The Mundingburra result obviously gives your federal campaign a boost?

HOWARD:

I congratulate the Queensland Liberals on the result. I’m very pleased tor them But I don’t  have any smug reaction to Mundingburra, I really don’t. It was essentially a State result. I  have four weeks o f very hard work ahead o f me to win the trust and respect and support o f  the Australian people. I don’t take anything for granted. I’m  not taking the Australian  people for granted, and I ’ve got to work my heart and soul out to win this election and any  Liberal who sort of thinks there is some note o f triumphalism coming out o f Mundingburra  better stop that straight away and understand that we’ve got a real fight ahead o f us.

JOURNALIST:

Don’t you think that Queensland voters will feel like they’ve given Labor enough o f a  kick  and therefore it might have the reverse effect? ... ~

HOWARD:

I just think we have four weeks o f very hard work ahead of us and I’m not taking anybody for  granted. I’ve got to work hard to win that trust and respect

JOURNALIST:

Are you pleasantly surprised that you did win, or it looks like you’ve won?

HOWARD:

Ã¢ÂÂ cissy

I am happy for the Queensland Liberal Party, I congratulate M r Tanti and I congratulate Joan  Sheldon, but I again repeat one should not draw any particular Federal implications from the  result and no Liberals should get any sense o f complacency or any sense o f taking things for

granted because the Australian public rightly expects o f its political leaders the use o f the  campaign period to win their trust and respect i ^ ;

JOURNALIST:

Mr Howard will you penalise high income earners who don’t take out private health  insurance?

HOWARD:

1 thought I had ruled that out some months ago............  -  ^ ^

JOURNALIST:

But will you confirm that you will allow tax rebates for those earning under ...(inaudible),..?

HOWARD:

I’m not going to confirm anything that I haven’t already dealt with publicly beyond  confirming that it has been our health policy for a year to provide an incentive for people to  have and to take out private health insurance. That has been a cornerstone o f our approach to  health for a long time. But there’s been a bit of guesswork and speculation in the press today  and I wouldn’t take everything you’ve read as gospel truths.

JOURNALIST:

Mr Keating’s says it will create gold plated incomes for specialists, and gold plated costs for  private health insurance and you won’t have a better health system under your plan. What do  you say to that?

HOWARD:

I thought the gold plated people in Australia’s political history were the Labor Party  particularly here.

JOURNALIST:

ACOSS this morning have come out with some statements, saying that the whole value o f  private insurance is over rated anyway. What’s your reaction to that?

HOWARD: .......

I’m not going to react to speculation.

JOURNALIST;

Can any government afford to offer tax rebates given the costs that it imposes on the Federal  Budget?

HOWARD:

That comes in the same category as the last question.

JOURNALIST*

. ..(inaudible)... specialists and the cost o f health insurance?

HOWARD:

We will retain Medicare, bulk-billing and community rating, and we’ll provide an incentive  for people to take out private health insurance and Pm not saying anything beyond that

JOURNALIST;

Will medical specialists be better off? Will specialists be better off Mr Howard?

HOWARD;

We’ll provide a health system that makes the average Australian better off.

JOURNALIST:

Will the costs to the Government be any higher than it is at the moment?

HOWARD:

You’re wasting your time,

JOURNALIST:

Mr Keating says the Liberal Party’s full o f hollow men with no plan, have you got a response  to that?

HOWARD:

No plans. Well you’d expect Mr Keating to say th at I think we’ve seen enough o f his plans.  His plans have produced record levels o f youth unemployment, record levels o f foreign debt  He’s got lots o f plans, the trouble is they’re all wrong and they’ve caused the worst recession  in 60 years. He took unemployment above a million. If that’s his plan, I think the Australian  people are well and truly fed up with it.

JOURNALIST;

What’s your plan?

HOWARD;

My plan is to create real jobs for young Australians through revitalising small business.

JOURNALIST;

You have eight of the fourteen seats here in Western Australia. Will you concede that you  might have trouble hanging onto one or two o f those?

HOWARD;

I expect that we’ll retain them all, but it will take a lot o f hard work and T’ve got my eyes set  on one or two others. But you know I don’t take any o f these things for granted, I really  don’t. It’s going to be a very hard election campaign for all o f  us and I just don’t want any  Liberal to imagine because we started well and we’ve got a few opinion polls supporting us  that this is anything other than a very tough fight. It can change, and things can go bad and  people should understand that.

JOURNALIST;

Labor says the polls in Western Australia are good for them. Do you concede that Premiers  Richard Court and Jeff Kennett are liabilities for the Federal Coalition this election?

HOWARD;

Well I certainly don’t regard either o f those men as liabilities. I think both o f them are doing  excellent jobs as Premiers o f their respective State. I think you’ve been in this game long  enough to know that there’s a fair amount o f nonsense talk from time to time particularly by  the Labor Party about internal research. They’ve spent 12 months sort o f telling everybody  how badly they were going and now they’re sort o f saying things are getting better. I guess  the truths could be somewhere in between.

JOURNALIST:

Mr Howard you’ve told Channel 10 on a program to be aired tomorrow night that you’re not  in favour o f gambling and you’re not a supporter o f casinos. Doesn’t that put you at odds  with people like Mr Kennett who’s a  greater supporter of casinos...

HOWARD;

Well watch the program, it’s a  very good program and that’s not a  free plug for any particular  channel, it’s a free plug for the subject o f the program, I’ve got a few things to say about that  issue. I think you’ve misconstrued it a little, it doesn’t put me at odds with anybody. I think

people in election campaigns expect their political leaders to express their personal views  about social issues. I think they’re cowards if they don’t.

JOURNALIST: ................

By you’re not campaigning in Curtin, or in Moore because you fully expect to have to deal  with those former Liberals who will be Independents after the election?

HOWARD: ^

Oh no, no. Look I’m campaigning in marginal seats, neither o f those seats can be won by the  Labor Party, full stop.

JOURNALIST:

Mr Keating said this morning that he wasn’t hiding the budget blowout from the people. Do  you think he’s hiding a budget blowout?

HOWARD:

Well I don’t know. Because he’s got the facts, and he’s got the solemn moral obligation to  tell the Australian people if the budget position now in projection for next year is  significantly worse than what he has previously asserted. I have no idea because he’s got the

figures. I mean the only people who know about that are the Treasurer and the Prime  Minister and if the situation is markedly different from what they have said, they have a very  solemn moral obligation to tell us.

JOURNALIST:

Will that change all your election promise plans?

HOWARD:

Look, I’m not going to get drawn into speculation beyond saying that we have based our  plans, which I might say are very modest particularly so far as funding is concerned, we’ve  based those plans very much on the information that’s available to us and I can only say  again that if the information is different he has an obligation to tell us.

JOURNALIST:

if  you win the election will you invite back into the Party Allan Rocher or Paul Filing if they  win their seats?

HOWARD:

Oh look I’m not going to speculate about those things that are entirely within the control o f  the Party organisation. Look, let me make it clear. I want the endorsed Liberal candidates in  Western Australia to win the seats they’re running for, each, and every one of them, and

therefore my support is for the two endorsed Liberal candidates in those two seats. I’ve made  that clear and I make it clear again.

JOURNALIST:

Has the WALilml Party got its house in order?

HOW ARD: '

I think the WA Liberal Party did an outstanding job in the last election and I expect it to do  an outstanding job in this election. I have always admired the organisational capacity o f the  WA Division o f the Liberal Party. It has taught divisions o f the Liberal Party in other parts o f  Australia a few lessons as far as winning a handsome number o f seats.

Thank you.
