GOVERNMENT MUST DO MORE FOR REGIONAL SETTLEMENT SERVICES



After repeated calls from Labor, the Morrison Government is still keeping secret a major review

into humanitarian resettlement.



This is an important report that aims to improve the integration, employment and settlement

outcomes of refugees in this country. The Australian public have a right to see it.  Failing to

release this report is treating the public with contempt, as well as letting down refugees and

our communities.



It is clear the Morrison Government lacks a whole-of-government regional settlement strategy.



We know highly skilled refugees under Humanitarian Settlement Program are finding it very

difficult to find a suitable job through job active network providers.





In Victoria, particularly Bendigo, there is a great record of private sector and community

engagement with humanitarian migrants in recognising and addressing the challenges to

participate actively in the regional economy. Specific settlement services such as workplace

familiarisation training programs and programs that provide a logical extension to the English

training deliver genuine professional employability pathways for skilled migrants and refugees.



Implementing effective programs for the attraction and retention of migrants and refugees in

regional areas is essential in building strong regional communities, as well as the ongoing well-being of migrants and refugees living in those areas.



We should be doing everything we can to help people get the support they need, find work and

integrate into the community. Clearly the Morrison Government is not doing enough.
