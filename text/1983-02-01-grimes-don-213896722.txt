THE ELECTION

.  Â· ÃÂ

A

The early and unwarranted March 5th election was sprung on  Australia because the Prime Minister was determined to force  a Double Dissolution before June and because he miscalculated  the spirit of the Australian Labor Party.

He believed we would be divided. We are not.  We are united  and ready to fight this election on a comparison of the  Liberals' record and promises and the Labor Party's past and  present policies.

This 'Social Security Bulletin'  like that for the 1980 election,  will be confined to welfare matters - to issues which affect  social security pensioners and beneficiaries and low income  families.

THE LIBERAL-COUNTRY PARTY

From Mr Fraser's policy speech of 15 February:

"Over two years we have increased all family allowances by  50%" .

When family allowances were introduced in 1976 to replace the  child endowment plus indexed tax rebates Malcolm Fraser called  it 'the greatest social reform since Federation'.

He lost interest in his 'reform'  for the next four years and  family allowances declined in value as inflation soared.

Panic in the last days of the 1980 election prompted the  Prime Minister to promise to spend his additional oil rake-off  on higher family allowances.

In the 1981 Budget he increased them on the cheap.  The 50%  rise went only to parents with three or more dependent children -  only 26% of parents of young children. Three-quarters of  families with dependent children struggled on with payments

stuck at 1976 levels.

In the 1982 Budget which signalled that the Prime Minister  intended to force an early election - a strategy which  stumbled over the revelations of massive tax fraud in the  Costigan Report - a 50% rise was given to families with one  or two children.

The great 'reform'  lost its momentum and family allowances  never maintained their 1976 value after they were introduced. The present situation is that -.  a family with one child now receives $45 a year less in

real terms than in 1976. The total loss to that family  since 1976 has been $409.

.  a family with two children gets $110 a year less in real  terms than in 1976, the total loss since 1976 being $993.

.  a family with three children receives $188 a year less in real terms than in 1976, the total loss since 1976 being $1,523.

"Our family Budget put $18 a week into the hands of typical  Australian families."

In the Budget Mr Howard claimed it would put $18 a week into the  hands of typical families, and Mr Fraser gives no explanation  of the rise by $1. .

But as we have said before, Mr Howard's definition of the 1  typical  Australian family1  is one with a dependent wife, two children,   a family income of $300 a week and a mortgage.

On that basis there are only 8 1  typical families' in every  1,000 families in Australia.

The overwhelming majority of families - 992 out of 1,000 -  missed out on the $17 or $18 a week package.

ÃÂ

I'.We helped low income families, especially with our innovative  family income supplement.."

Only 35,000 low income working families, most of them self-employed  or with incomes below minimum awards, will collect the family  income supplement.

Pensioner families, particularly single parents and families on  unemployment benefits, were not given access to family income  supplement or an increase in the allowance for pensioners'  children.

.  a single parent with two children is currently $15.51 a week  below the poverty line; and with four children $34.65 a week  below the poverty line.

.  an unemployed family with two children is $13,66 a week below  the poverty line, and with four children $36.15 a week below  the poverty line.  Ã¢ÂÂ

There has been far more neglect of low income families than assistance.

"We will adjust unemployment benefits for single people over 18  in line with other pensions and benefits in May."

The Fraser Government stopped the indexation of the single adult  unemployment benefit in 1978 ,  with the result that their benefit  is now almost $13 a week below the payment to single pensioners.

The Prime Minister offers them a once-only indexation rise of  $4.25 a week next May. It will be based on the 1982 September  and December CPI movements - in effect, just a delayed catch-up.

Because the unemployment benefit is indexed by a smaller amount,  single unemployed adults will be $15 a week behind when the  pension is next raised.

All the single adult unemployed will have at the end of 1985,  if the Liberals are returned, is $4.25 a week compensation for  1982 price rises.

The Liberal Government cannot justify paying a single 40 year  old retrenched woman, or a widower on the scrap heap because  his factory has closed, $750 a year less than pensioners next  door with the same needs and expenses.

And remember that the gap will widen in the future if there is  another Liberal Government.

The 16 and 17 year old unemployed are offered nothin. An  increasing number of these teenagers are in areas of high  unemployment where their parents too are unemployed and finding  it almost impossible to feed and shelter an unemployed youngster  who has to split his $40 into board, transport,  clothing and

job seeking costs.

Note

The unemployment benefit rise to $68.25 is equivalent to  $221 in a full year.

The total cost given by the Prime Minister of $102 million  implies an average of 461,540 single adult beneficiaries in  1983-84.

The proportion of single adults to all beneficiaries was 64%  and is falling.  If we assume 62% we can expect the number of  unemployment beneficiaries to average 744,000 through 1983-84,  compared with the current average estimate of 525,000.

These official estimates imply an increase of an average of  219,000 on unemployment benefit next year, and an increase of  42% in unemployment levels.

"The Government strongly believes in child care. In the Budget  we lifted funding by almost 50%. We will expand that program  by providing 150 new child care projects." ($7.5 million allocated)

As with so many of the Fraser Budget decisions, the 1982 increase  in children's services was rescued from neglect and framed with  an early election in mind.

The 1982 allocation is $25 million less in real terms than in  the last Labor Budget of 1975.

"We helped the older members of our families. The family  budget increased the income limits for pensions and expanded  rental assistance. To give further support to pensioners we  will increase access to the health benefits card with a

substantial further increase in the income limits."

That is his sole reference to pensioners.

He has promised one thing only - to raise the fringe benefit levels  to $70 a week for a single pensioner and to $110 a pensioner couple.

This will help only 28,000 of 2 million pensioners.

It will go only to those pensioners whose income, including pension,  is between $136 and $152 a week (single) and between $227.20 and  $247.20 (pensioner couple).

ÃÂ

Ã¢ÂÂ¦  '  .

There is nothing for the poorest pensioners, the million and a half who struggle on w ith only their pension or less than $20 a week extra. The Liberals have ignored their needs altogether

THE LABOR PARTY

From Mr Hawke's policy speech of 15 February:

"We are committed to raising over a three-year period the basic  pension rate from 22% of average male earnings,to which it has  fallen under Fraser, to 25%. Once we reach that goal we will  maintain that 25 per cent proportion until it is possible to

take the pension higher.

"Pensions will be adjusted on the basis of the immediately  prior six month CPI movement to cut the present lag of four  months to one month."

These commitments mean that the pension in November will be  adjusted to CPI movements in June and September,  and the May  adjustment will be based on December and March CPI movements.

As a first step towards our goal of 25% of average weekly  earnings our November 1983 pension increase will include  cost of living adjustments for three quarters - March, June  and September 1983. After that, the May 1984 increase will  be based on the December 1983 and March 1984 CPI movements, and

the November 1984 increases on the June and September CPI.

Other adjustments needed to reach and then maintain the 25% goal  will be made at Budget time each year.

Pension rates based on 25% of average weekly earnings will take  all single pensioners and a great many pensioners with children  above the poverty line.

The 1983-84 cost of our pension rises will be around $183 million.

"Pensioner fringe benefit levels will be indexed".

Pensioner fringe belefit levels will be indexed twice-yearly,  so that indexation of private superannuation or other benefits  will not automatically result in the withdrawal of the health  card. This measure will considerably ease the possibility of

losing the health card because of overseas currency changes. It will also eliminate the administrative wasted effort of  constantly withdrawing and restoring the card.

"The Labor Government will return to the basic principle of the  right of all Australians to health services according to their  medical needs. Labor's new Medicare program involves simply the  replacement of the present crippling health fund contributions

by an income-related levy of one per cent of taxable income."

5 .

This means that pensioners who are not granted a health card  because their income falls outside the fringe benefit levels  will no longer have to fear the medical costs of sudden or  prolonged illness. Medicare will cover all costs in standard

hospital beds, with full medical costs paid where the doctor  bulk-bills and 85% where the doctor does not.

This is by far the most important fringe benefit for all pensioners.

"Zone allowances will be paid to social security beneficiaries  living in remote areas where costs are higher."

Pensioners and beneficiaries in remote areas have suffered in  the past by having to pay higher living costs for which they  have received no compensation. Taxpayers have received zone  allowances and wage-earners have had special loadings,  but  pensioners until now have had no recognition of their particular  hardship.

Labor's proposal is to pay pensioners and beiaeficiaries in Zone A :

.  $7 a week for single persons; $12 a week for couples;   and $3.50 a week for each child.

- and for pensioners and beneficiaries in Zone B:

.  $3 a week for single persons; $5 a week for couples;  and $1.50 a week for each child.

There will be a six months residence requirement.

"The major points of Labor's tax reform will be...

.  a lift in the tax threshold for pensioners of $465 to $5,893.

"One peice of wholly unnecessary red tape which we shall  abolish immediately on coming to Government is the pharmaceutical  declaration form which has been imposed by the Fraser Government  on pharmacists, pensioners and the poor."

The Government has admitted it has no evidence of fraud in  the pharmaceutical benefits area.  The complexity of the  forms, the demands on the elderly, including the threat of  heavy penalties, have been the cause of great anxiety.

"Unemployment benefits will be progressively increased until  adult beneficiaries reach equality with single pensioners."

Because the Labor Party has consistently opposed the  discrimination in payment rates between pensioners and  beneficiaries we are eliminating by stages the gap between them.

The single adult unemployment benefit (and special benefit)  will be indexed each May and November by the CPI in the same  way as pensioners.

There will be additional payments each Budget to close the  gap between pensions and benefits.

"Young unemployed will be paid an additional $5 a week  and given greater access to training."

Those 16 and 17 year olds looking for work will have a benefit  rise from $40 to $45 a week,  and be eligible for supplementary  (rent) assistance if living independently.

Higher education allowances will be paid to enable teenagers  who wish to .do so to continue general or particular education  in appropriate institutions.

"All adult unemployed will be eligible for a $10 a week rental assistance after six weeks on benefit. Junior beneficiaries will also be eligible if they are living away from home."

This will be of considerable help to young single adults  paying private rents on a low benefit rate, and to families  where the breadwinner has been retrenched and the family  could not otherwise afford rent they have been paying.

It is one of our most important pledges to unemployed families.

"While Labor is committed to the maintenance of family  allowances, our first priority must be to low income families.

"The most immediate need here is for reform of the absurdly  restrictive family income supplement proposed in the last Budget.   This will be done by relaxing the income test so that the  supplement is reduced by only 25 cents for each extra dollar  of family income, rather than the present 50 cents. This  will ensure that eligibility is extended into a much wider

range of lower and middle incomes."

The Labor Party accepts the obligation to take all families,  whether pensioner or beneficiary, or low income working families,  out of poverty. Too many families raising young Australians  are caring for their children on unacceptably low incomes.

We will assess for the first Labor Budget the priorities to be  given to the existing array of allowances for children.

For pensioner and beneficiary families this must include an  increase in allowances for pensioners' (and beneficiaries') children.

For working families on low incomes it must include an evaluation  of the family income supplement and its extension to poor families  who are at present excluded from it. Those families will benefit  by the introduction of Medicare which will free them from costly

contributions to private health funds, but the family income  supplement is a special recognition of the hardship suffered by  low income families.

In addition to the payments to be made for pensioners' children  and for children in the range of families who would be eligible  for a less restrictive family income supplement, we would also  consider the status of family allowance payments.

The Labor Party is committed to the maintenance of the present  system of family allowances,  and their possible adjustment will  also be reviewed at Budget time.

"Our Children's Services program will provide for the varying needs  of children, and is essential to enable parents to play a fuller  part in society.

"Labor would allocate $20 million extra for child care in its  first Budget, equivalent to $30 million in a full year. These  funds, which will finance 400 new child care projects, will be  directed into areas of pressing need."

Other Labor policies were not able, because of pressure of  space and time, to be included in Mr Hawke's policy speech.

In the pressure of an election campaign it is difficult to  specify the range of services which we hope to introduce for  disabled persons.

We have committed ourselves to some funding for community  development projects and extended domiciliary services.

We hope that innovative policies will result from directions  accepted by us and others brought to our attention by community  groups.

If, as we trust and expect, the Labor Party becomes the Government  at the end of counting on the night of 5 March 1983, the 'Social  Security Bulletin'  from this office will fold.

We thank our attentive readers of the last three and a quarter years.
