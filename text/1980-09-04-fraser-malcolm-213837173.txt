PRIIV1E MINISTER

FOR MEDIA 4 s. EPTElV1BER 1950

PRIME MINISTER’S RESPONSE TO WELCOMING  ADDRESSES BY PRESIDENT REDDY AND . Â·  PRIME MINISTER GANDHI AT CHOGRM .

Your Excellency,  President Reddy, Heads of StateÂ·,. Heads of

Government,  Secretary General, distinguished guests,  ladies .

and gentlemen. .

It gives me the greatest pleasure to respond to the

gracious words of welcome addressed to us by His Excellency

President Reddy and Prime Minister Gandhi.

This second regional meeting of Commonwealth Hoads of

Government is, very appropriately, being hosted by the country

whose independence, 32 years ago, set in train that international

decolonisation movement which eventually led to the creation of

the' free and equal Commonwealth of Nations whose members we are.

This meeting is being held in one of the great democratic

Ã¢ÂÂ¢capitals of the world. It is a fitting place for our

deliberations.

I join most readily and happily in welcoming the Heads

of Government of those countries whose independence has been .

achieved since the first meeting - Kiribati,. Tuvalu,.  the Solomon

Islands and Vanuatu. I trust that they will find this a congenial

and rev/arding forum. Â·  .  '  ' Â·  .  .  :  .

The first Commonwealth Heads of. Government regional

meeting, the latest in many innovations in the evolving pattern

of Commonwealth consultation, was held two and a half years ago Ã¢ÂÂ

In Sydney. The thinking behind this initiative was that we,

unlike most of our other Commonwealth colleagues,  lacked an

alternative regional arrangement outside the Commonwealth which

brought us all together on a regular basis: second, that some o j .  .

the smaller and more remote members would find such a meeting

particularly beneficial. For Australia - and I believe for others

in the eastern part of the region - the arrangement had the

particular attraction of strengthening our links with the .

sub-continent.

The spirit, of the initiative was practical and pragmatic;

its orientation was towards the tackling of specific functional

problems and projects;  its aim was to enhance regional

cooperation and the regional meeting was seen as one which

would contribute to the vitality and stature of the wider

Commonwealth.  .

Mr President,  I think it is true that in any enterprise

of this kind the second meeting is always a crucial one. The

first is likely to be sustained by the novelty of the occasion

and initial enthusiasm. But this second meeting in Delhi will

be crucial in providing the opportunity to develop momentum

from now on and in shaping the lineaments of CHOGRM1s future.

I trust that in four days' time there will have emerged the

outlines of a pattern of practical cooperation under .  the CliOGRii

umbrella. That pattern should seek to be of benefit to the

region as a whole.  Â·

- J

Mr President, I have put the stress firmly on the

practical and I believe that this is where it should be.

But as we meet here we cannot ignore the fact that in the two

years since our last meeting in Sydney there have been momentous

changes on the wider international scene.  It is difficult to

see many of these as anything but changes for the worst.

The world is now breathing a harsher air and the decade we

have just entered promises to be a troubled and dangerous

one.  Vie in this chamber cannot contemplate these changes

with detachment and indifference, since some of them impinge

very directly on our region and have implications for its

future.

.  I do not think we should be embarrassed or inhibited

because there exist among us some differences of interpretation

as to the causes and nature of some of these events.  Vie have

different perspectives - historical as well as geographical -

and different interests which make such divergences inevitable.

It is healthier to recognise this rather than to pretend

that it is not so.

But there is no need either to dwell on these

differences or to make them the focus of our discussions.

For I am sure that, however v/e interpret events, none of us

can be complacent about their actual and potential consequences

for the region. The intrusion of great power rivalries; .

deteriorating relations between some of the states within

the region; attempts to divide existing states; the human

misery,  and the strain on resources,  represented by hundreds

of thousands of refugees - these are facts which, regardless

of what interpretation of causes is accepted, represent

impediments to the goal of stable and continuous development

in the region.. .  .  .

Insofar.as we discuss recent disturbances and conflicts

at this meeting, therefore, I believe that we should do so

looking forward, in terms of how we can live with and respond

to consequences, rather than looking backwards in terms of

origins and the attributing of blame. .

In approaching these questions we might well bear

in mind and. take heart from the major contributions made by '

the Commonwealth to the resolution of the seemingly intractible

problems of Zimbabwe last year. That contribution demonstrated

that the smaller and middle-sized countries c-f the world need '

not be without influence. When I visited India for the Ã¢ÂÂ

Independence Day celebrations in January 1979, I maintained

that there was an urgent need for the voices of moderation in

the world to speak out with conviction that the causes of . \

toleration, reason and world order demanded the same passionate

support as is all too often reserved for extremism. Events

since then have .increased that urgency. Â·  .  .

There is a role for a 11 of us to play in this .respect;

we should not allow ourselves' to be over-awed by events or to

denigrate the potential influence of reasonable views resolutely

put. '  '  .  '  '

Mr President,  in concluding these brief remarks I

wo Vi Id like, to sayÂ· again how pleased I am to be. back in your

great country. I look forward to an exchange of views with

old and new friends and to a constructive conference.'
