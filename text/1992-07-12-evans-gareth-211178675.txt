Address by Senator Gareth EVans, Ministor !or ForQi9n Af!airs  and Trade, to Public Forum sponsored by the Zionist Fed~ation  of Australia, caulfiGld Town Ball, Ã¢ÂÂ¢.elbourne, 12 July 1992

It has b-een nearly  Jewish comm unity  AUStralia's Hiddla

t1rÃ¢Â‘o years since a public l!lQQtinq ot the

last put lnQ through the 'Wringer on

East policy although thare has not

exactly bean a shortage of comm unication, private and public,  bet;;een me and your r e pr es entativ~a since then! When I did

speak last to such an audience it vas Septem..b~ 1990, the

second month of the C\.llf Crisis follo Jt~ ing Ã¢Â‘ Saddu Hussein's  invasion of :Kuwait. !t was a ti:a.e o! agonisin9 uncertainty  and tension, And it was a tue 'lltbich led me to say

apocalyptically, if not particularly originally - that "tho  MiddlQ East tindar-box is closer to ignition point than it has  been for decades".

In the ~ v ent, that cris is 'io'as resol ved Q....,iftly and

decisively, albeit bloodily, Iraq's invasion was reversed,

without the whole region igniting, ~nd. this occurred as a  :;.:esult of the :::

and for the first time since the Korean War, o! the United  };ations 1 s collective security cap-ability. Moreover, in the

aftermath o! the War signi!icant steps have been taken  backed by continuing intGrnational sanctions - to eliminate  Iraq's weapons o! mass destruction and its capacity to produce  them in the future.

Nobody suggests that the proble " of Iraq has been resolved

once and for all. SaddaJn Hussein'  " regi.Jna, which the world  had hoped 'loo'ould Ã¢Â‘be ov~thrown, rQI!lains intact; it continues  to do everything it can to frustrate the efforts of the Unit~  Nations disannarnent tea:rns; and the plight o! tlre Kurds and

Shiites remain only tha most obvious of the human

rights abuses that continua to be p~rpetrated. Th~ra ia no  doubt, ho'Wever, that not just Kuwait, but thQ region as a  t,..rhole, is con~idarably more 5ecure today t."'lan it would have  been had th~ international community not responded as it did.

Tne Peace Legacv o! the Gulf Crisis

Moreover, and of crucial importance tor the central thame ot  our discus~ion tonight, th~ resolution of the Gulf crisis has  proved to be the long-~ w aited catalyst for a major new e!!ort  to resolve L~at most intractablQ of all Middle last problaros -

the conflict bet~een Israel and its Ar~b and Palestinian  neigf'.JJours. I spoke to you two years ago of -o.y,hope that the  re.solution of the Gulf crisis would become a "springboard" 1 as  James BaAQr had put it, for the resolution o! the Arab-Israeli

conflict. And I spoke o! my hope, shared by so rnany, that thQ  r~~olution ot the Crisis ~ould ~contains within it the seeds

of an e~rlier, more ~ide-ranging and more durable Middle East

peace than could pr~viously have bBan imagined".

Th osQ hopes have bagun to be rQalised with the Peac~

ccnfarence tnat opened in Madrid on 30 October last year under  t..~a joint Chairmanship o! the Unite-d States and the (then)

Sovi ~~ Union, and which has continued subsequently ';.r'.i~ a

complex seri$5 of bilateral and multilateral negotiatin~  sessions eleven altogether, in seven different cities.  Under the agreed terms of reference t.~e multilateral talks -to which are invit~d all the regior.al countries and others

lik~ the EC as w~ll - are intended to address region-wide

issues, specifically arms control an~ regional 5ecurity,  regional economic development, 'Water resources, the  environment, and re!u9ees.

The bilat~ral talks are to take place betw~Qn Israel and,

respectively, Syria, Lebanon, and a joint Jordanian " Palaetinian delQgation. In each case they -take place  expressly on the basis of United Nations Security Council  Resolutions 242 and 338, which refer ot course not only to the

3

need for Israeli withdrawal !rom the Occupied Territories and  a "just settlament of the re!ugee question" but also d~and  r$epect !or and acknowledgment ot t..i.e sovereignty  and territorial integrity and political indQpendence

of. ~very state in the ~sa and their right to live

in P'ace ...,i thin secure and recognised. boundaries  rreQ from thr~ats or acts of force.  The tarms o! reference also set a target timetable. Talks on  interim self-government arrangem~ta !or the Occupied

Terri tori es are to be conducted " "Ã¢Â‘i th the obj ecti va o:f  rGacbing agreel:'lent within one yearn, i.e. by Octob&r 1992.  once agreed 1 those interim arrang~ents ar~ to. continue ! or  five years 1 during the third year ot 'Which per icx1 - and only  then - negotiations are to take placQ on the question of

"permanent status".

The i ~~ Qdiate credit !or the initiation o! this process, upon  which the hopes o! eo :many are now riding, is dUQ

overwhel~ingly to Secretary of State James Baker, 'Without

lo'l".ose tireHsesly creative diploro..acy it would silnply r.ot l:ave  come about. Tha magnitude o! his achievament should be

acknc~ledged avsn by those who have concerns about some of the

policy positions - not least on the loans issue - ta.Jcen by him  and the US Government along the way. But it also needs to be  appreciated that Baker's diplomacy ..,.as itself something that  could only have borne fruit against the bacXdrop of the

successful resolution ot tha Gulf conflict. There \i&re four  key Qlements in that backdrop,

First, thQre was the demonstrated ~illingness of the Cold War  superpowers to put the. past behind them and _.crk together to  deal with international aggressors - not just rhetorically,  but militarily - through the institutional :machinery of the  United Nations. ThQ constructive and. decisive role played by  the then Soviet Union in this respect had a particularly

salutary impact on its previous Arab clients, not least Syria,  who were forced to come to tenus "With a _.holly new

international reality.

The i~cond cn1oial ele.mant in the Gulf crisis was that so many

Arab nations joinQd the international consensuQ against  Saddrun. tgypt, Saudi Arabia, Syria and La.banon - with only

Jordan, in the immediate region, standing aside - all mad.&  clear tilBir distaste for what Iraq had done, in defiance of  emotional appGals to J?an i\rabism and in an unprecQdentedly  striking breach o! Arab solidarity.

The third el~Gnt helping to crGate the right environllient tor  t ~he Madrid p~ace process was, by contrast, the unsavoury and.

profoundly ill-judged role played by the leadership of th&  Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) in supporting Sadda.ll'l  Hussein throughout the Gulf Crisis. This roh~ helped con! irm  the trend - although this should not be exaggerate~ - towards

greatar relative stature being Gnjoyed within tho Palestinian  movement by its leadership within the Occupied Terri tor ie~.  This trand, in turn,  find a formula for

enabling it to come

ironically, onQ might think, givan the role local P~lestini~ns  played in initiating the lntifadl), but s~ch ironiQe are the  stuff of Middle East politics).

A !ourth iJtportant contribution to the Arab-Israsli peace  process made by the Gulf Ã¢Â‘ contl ict "it.Tas thQ hishly creditable  role played by Israel i tselt. Nobri thstandin9 t.."'le tearful  provocation of the SCUD attacks (and the intense eJnotional  provocation ot PalQetinians being s~sn cheering the Jniseiles

international community tor the intelligence and moderation of  its &tanoe.

These, then, are the factors which  possible the Madrid peace procass  ca:m.e together to max&  the best chance that

differences. Nobody came to that  it would neces;arily and inevitably  Nobody bQlieved that the process was

going to be sel!-exaouting - automatically producing positive  results within the agreed ti~e fra~e.s. Nobody underestimated  the difficulties that would be involved in the negotiating  process after forty-three years of bitter eruni ty, and four

bloody and destructive wars. But, equally, there could be  nobody ot good faith who could possibly ar~.le with t.hG

proposition that it ~ould be truly tragic if this unique  historic opportunity to resolve the HiddlQ East conflict WQre  to be lost.

Tbe Peace PrQcess in May 1992

This, than, ~as the background to my visit to the Middle East  t-.~Ã¢Â‘o r.onths ago, a visit ;.. "hic.h took me ovar the coursQ of

t"Jelva days to Israel, Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and Iran,  interspersed \\lith side trips to Paris and Lisbon !or  multilateral zueetings .,i th Western foreign minister  colleagues. I found in the Middle East a political landscape

vary different to that which confronted Bill Hayden in 1988,  and indeed VC..."J different to that which had prevailed at any  ti me since thQ foundation of Israel. It was an environment in  "Which Isra~l and its n~ighbours had taken the first tentative

steps toward achieving full mutual recognition, and developing  ground rules that ~ould in future ensure not only their mutual  survival but thQir mutual prosperity.

But i! hopes ~ere high at

anxi~ties. To understand

course of my visit it is

the time of my visit, so too we.ra  why I reacted as I did durinq the  important that you appreciate the

extant to which I found a tangible, acute sense of anxiety  about the future of the peace process almost everywhere I went /  certainly among the Palestinians to whom I spoke in  Jeruesalem, the West Bank, .Alnman and Cairo; certainly amonq

all the Arab Goverrunant leaders whom I met; but also v~ry

- --Ã¢Â‘ -Ã¢Â‘-. ------. -Ã¢Â‘- -Ã¢Â‘Ã¢Â‘--- -Ã¢Â‘Ã¢Â‘ - ---------

stronqly  including  a.monq  those

my io.'astern forGign ministQr counterp~rts,  most steadfastly and  and also, striXinqly,  from  conspicuously supportive  among just about avery  those in the Likud

countries  o! I~:r~el;  prominent  GoVQTnment

Israeli I mst apart !rom  leadership (and I had

discussions in Tel Aviv W'i th more than a dozen such Israeli  editori, co ~ ~ntatore, think-tank experts, political activists  and retired qenerals occupying political positions across a  broad centra-le~t to centre-right spectrum}.

The language and emphasis varied from place to plaC$1 ~d from  person to parson, but there wa5 a remarkable consistency about  the nature o! the anxiety that was expressed. , That anxiety  ~as simply this: that W'hile the peace process had got of! to

a good. enough start, and while nobody Q.Xpect~ really Jnaj or  breakthrough& to occur in the self-government negotiations  bafort the I~raeli elections, six month& of the initial twelve  months negotiating period had expired with v~ry little  disce.rniblQ progress of any kind having been made in thei  negotiations - and this was placing at fundamental risk the

inherently fragile peace constituency of moderate Palestinians  and ~oderatQs ~ithin the Arab Governments.

Th$ slo~ progress of the formal bilateral negotiations ~as not  by itself such a major causa for concern: what made it so ~as  that it ~as accompanied by t~o 2ther factors makinq it harder  avery day !or moderate Palestinians and other Arabs to hold

the lina against th~ir extremist brethran. Those factors were  thQ continuation unabated o! the massive program of sQttle~ent  buiJ.ding in the Occupied Territories, and the continuation  unabated in those territories of occupation policies p$rceivad  as highly oppr~ssive in human riqhte terms.

I am not suggesting for a moment now, nor ~as I in the Middle  East, that this combination of factors ~as, then or now, tha  QDly set of obstacles to the peace process. We must never be  naive about how many constituencies, apart !rom the ~oderata

ones, there are in the Middle East. WQ must never forqet the

- . -- --Ã¢Â‘. -Ã¢Â‘ -Ã¢Â‘----- ----- -- Ã¢Â‘------

destructive role that so many of these conetituencise have  playQd in the past, and woul6 again in th$ future it they had  a chance. We must never forget or ignore the reality of the

security threat, both ~xternal and internal, to which Israel'a  geography and history exposes it. We must ngver forget that  it i' the obligation of eve.ry responsibl~ :rn~mber of th~

international co1t'llnunity to help ensure that thos~ thr$ats to  !sraQl's s&curity are once and for all removed. I :mad.Q thosQ  points over an6,, again in my private talks with Arab Go verrunant  and Palestinian represe.nta t i ves, and I vi 11 CO!nG back in a  ::uoment to spell out in a 1 i ttle lilore detail just 'w'ha t I did

say. I accept, in retrospect, that it would certainly have  lsd to a more balanced perception of my and ~e .Australian  Government t s poe i tion hac.i I l!'lada morQ use . of such 1 imi ted  opportu..1iti's as I had to spell these thi11gs out publicly as  we 11.

The point t.'l-J.at I think needs to be made by me now, however,

evan it it is not an easy one for me to make to this audience,  is tJiat in the Middle East as I saw it in May 1992 the most  i:mnediate and serious current . obstacles to the poace process  wQre t..~ose being posed by the attitudes and policies of the

then Israeli Goverrunent - and that this perc~ption lt'3S ver;y  ~idely held, not just by ?alestinians and oL~Qr Arabs, but by

a VQry large nU!D.ber of Israelis sns! by just about th4 whole  Weatern foreign policy co~unity,

In r.very complex negotiation involving parties with strongly  hr.ld views the immediate onus of responsibility for ~oving the  proc&ss forward, or avoiding a break-down, tends to ahi!t back  and !orth. Every party to such a negotiation of course has 6n

obligation to contribute equally to the !inal o-utcome, but it  is the ease that the spotlight of responsibility shifts :rrom  time to time along the way. And it just happened to be the  c!.sa that, in the particular circwnstances of May 1992, the  spotlight was sq-uarely on IsraQl. /

My perceptions - reinforce~ not only by vhat I saw !or ~ysalt

on the ground, but by what I heard !rom those on both aides o!  the argument in I~rael ~ere not idiosyncratic or ill "

founded. You can (any many of you already. have) contest my  judgment in znaJdng some of t.hoee p~rceptions public,

particularly in ways that did under-emphasise other Q ides 't.O  the ar~Qnt. But I would not ~ish you to doubt the

g$nuinenQss with which I tonned and expressed thQ vie..., that,  quite apart from all the other difficultiQe and uncertainties  it faced, the whole peace process was in danger of early  ccllapse unless there ';;as somQ urgent and !und~ental changes  to the policy approach adopt~d by the IsraQli Gov~nment. Nor

would I wi'h you to doubt the genuineness with which I held  the vic~ that maybe just maybe so~e Ã¢Â‘strong ..,.,ords o!

warning !rom a long-standing and unequivocal friend of Israel  might have a bettar chance o! bGing heard and understood than  ;uch ~erda coming from somewhare else.

I do not want to unduly labour tonight the particular concerns  I had. I have expressed them elsewhere, and hopefully now

there i6 every sign that, !ollo;.ring the Israeli election,  those concerr.s Yill be dramatically alleviated. But to :m..ake  my position clear I have to sketch them at least in outline.

In r91ation to settlements, the problem iias s illlply that the  pace and scala o! new building, and the creation o! new  demographic realities to go with it, had been almost  universally perceived as incompatible ~ith the ultimate

achievement of a nagotiat9d "land. for pQace" outccne. The  pQ..rmanent status o! the territories is not, under the agre9d  terms o! rQference o! the peace proc~~s, a matter for

negotiation now. But if the peace process is to be kept  alive, so must be the 'land for peacQ' option. At the time of  my visit there had already been established in the occupied

territories at laast 140 different Jewish. settlem.ents  involving 2 60, 000 settlQ.rs: Q.Ven if one omits !rom this  Q.quation the wall o! settlements around East Jerusalem, where  there are so~e 145,000 Jewish residents (now outnumbering the

---- Ã¢Â‘ Ã¢Â‘Ã¢Â‘-- -----Ã¢Â‘ ---- Ã¢Â‘ ----.. ---- ----------------- -Ã¢Â‘--- -Ã¢Â‘-Ã¢Â‘-Ã¢Â‘- -Ã¢Â‘ --- -

120,000 Arabs of East JerusalQm), th~a are still aroun~  115,000 other~ livinq in the Occupied Territories, and not  just in the strategic areas of the Jordan Vall "y and elsewhere  but near Nablus, Ramallah, Hebron and other areas ri9ht in the  Pale$tinian heartland.

Moreover, as a recent US state Department HR~port on

Sattlements" indicates, although this ha& r.ot beQn ~idely  publicisQ~, whi~e the actual land area occupied by eettlem~nt

buildings is not yet vr-ay large in percent3ge terms, fully  half the land in the 1-.Ã¢Â‘est Bah.k and one-third of the land in  Caza has in !act been set aside for Israeli use - through  declaring araas closed on security grounds, ,requisitioning

land !or military needs, confiscating ab~entee property,  e:-:-p!'opr i ating land !or public use, cr d~clar iz;g e.rsus to be  statQ land.

so far as hrnnan rights problems in the Occupied TQrritoriGs  ~ere concernGd, my starting point was the standards set in the

Fourth GQ.nava Pro-tocol on the Prot.ection o! Civil ian Persons  in the Ti~e o! War, which Israel itself has acknowl~dged as an  appropriate touchstone. Settle.ment building can itself be  ragarded as a violation of Article 49 ot that Convantion,

involving as it does a transfer of civilian population into  the occupied territory. But apart from that, serious proble~s  arisG 1Wi th anything in the nature of collective penal ties  (prohibited by Article 33), including cur!e1Ws and travel  restrictions i:mpos&d for essentially punitivQ purposes, and  the de.m.olition of family houses of those oolieved guilty of  ~~eng-doing; detentions ~ithout trial (addressed by Articles

42 and 64); deportations (prohibit~d by Article 49); and any  unjustified application of fatal force. or exces~ive violence  (prohibitGd by Article 3}. Th~ " are, unhappily, ~pla  grounds for believing that &very one of these prohibitions has  been 5ignificantly violated.

O! course it is the casG that such repressive measures as have

been applied in the Occupied Terri tori&s have occurred very

10

IDIJCh in response to tha violence and la.,..lessness 'llt'hich the

IsraeliG themselve~ - soldiers and civilians alike - have had  to confront, both in the form of deliberat& tactics of the  inti!adll and unrestricted excasse.Ei by particular individuals  and groups. Tha tragedy of the situation as I found it is, o!  course, the  "ay in ~hich the pattern of violence had become a  closed, vicious, circle. Action begets rQaction; violence

begets retaliatory repression 'w'hich beg$ts a ne'llt' round of  violence. The ,task is not to lock oneeel! ever more deeply  into the circle, but to find ways of breaking out o! it. The  trouble was that I found, in Hay, no ground for believing that

anycn " then in authority ~as sÃ¢ÂÂ¢riously trying to do so.

On the question of the Israeli CovermtQnt 1 s tactic~ at the

bargaining table, I accept that the $Videncfl of. Ule time was  perr .. aps more equivocal than my public statemQnts in Israel  acknowledged. No :more than vG.ry preliminary, and nanifestly  incomplete, self-goverrunent proposals had been held out until

tnen, but may~ more would have been fort..~conling !rom a re "

elected Li.Jcud Govs.rnment. My own instinct led l!le to have  serious doubts about thQ ultil!late seriousness ot Mr Shamir 1 s  com:mit~ent even to the first stage of the negotiations, and I

let those doubts show. I simply hope it will be acknowledged  no~ that perhape these doubts ware not e~tiraly without

foundation, given Mr ShaJnir 1 s report&d post-election r$.lUArks  to ~ariy that such ~cderation as hQ had shown in the talks to

dat~ had been 1llQ.rely tactical (rem~rks which h& doe$ not

appear to have subsequently personally disavowed, although his  privata ofrice has sought to explain tham) .

Wing sidee?

I have be&n ~idely criticised. - with a number o! pQople hare  tonight leading the charge! - !or saying publicly as much as I  did about Israel's human rights record, and as littlQ as I did  about the hwnan rights record of others in the -region and

their contribution in setting obstacles to the peace process.  I have already explained the general context in "Â´hich that

occurr "~Ã¢Â‘ A further contributinq factor ~as that the

opportunities I had !or press contact in Israel were not  repeated in Iran, Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan either

journalists did not turn up whQ.n and ~here ~xpected, or they  did not pursue the kind or questions I rQcaived in I~arael -but I have already acknowl~dged, a.nd do so again, that, with  the bene!it of hindsight I could have ~ade more or the li~ited  opportunities I had. Yet another factor was the way in which

som e sections of the media treated what I ill have to say:  Hark l~ibler could well hav~ said of my visit, as he was kind  ~nough to write in the 6~s t r~li~n Jewish Times of Bill

Hayden's in 1988, that 11the media treatQd his visit in the  sa~e way as th~y treat the issues superficially and

dramatically",

Ult me at leaet take ~dvantage o! the opportunity you have  kindly gi van me no.., to set the records straight about the  issuesÃ¢Â‘I did in fact raise.

In ~' Yha.re I met President Rafsanja.ni, Foreign Minister  Velayati and a number of other senior Ministers and advisers,  I pulled no punches. I talked about human rights

specifically the use o! the d~ath p~nalty on Bahais and

others, political detQntions and (in considerable detail) the  Rushdie a!!air. Of course I told the Iranian Government that  it; refusal to recognise Israel did it no cr~dit, and I also  raised Iran's links ~ith Hezbollah in Lebanon.

In Egypt, where I met :President Mubarak, Foreign Minister  Moussa the Supply Minister Abul-Dahab, I raised human rights  ~ith re9ard to the treatment, torture and detention ~Nithout

trial, of Islaznic diraidents. With Governm~nt Ministers and  the Arab L~aque $Qcretary-Genera 1, I raised, \ii th great  specificity, Australia's objections to the continuing Arab  economic boycott of Israel - an is:eue that I pursued, as I  promised the ZFA I ~ould, in avery Arab country.

12

In Syria, ~here I met President Assad and For~iqn Minister ll " Sharaa, I di~cussed at length our great continuing ccncern  about the e i tuation o! the Jewish col!lmuni ty there - m~ing  clear that }..ustralia, whilQ welcoming the. April announcament  of lifting of restrictions on leaving the country, wanted to  see thQJ!l fully impl~mented. I also raised political

detentions and exQcutions, especially public ha.ng ings 1 asÃ¢Â‘ '  hwr.an rights i~sues of concern to .Australia and th& whole  international community.

In both SyYia and LebanQn I raised at eome length, and ~ith a  perc:istence to which my interlocutors will tQsti!y, the  obstacles to the peace procsss posed by, their non "

participation in its multilat9ral seGsions, making t.be point  the.t tbe process ..., ~a intended to be a s~a.m+ess l!.mtually "

reinforcing whole. In Beirut, in association ..,..i th I!leetinge  with thG President, Foreign Minister and Spaaker of the  ParliamBnt, I raised very ~pacifically (and in tact publicly)

not only the situation in South Lebanon 1 but the destructive  role b~ing played there and wcrld-Yide by thQ Hezbolla.h -which led to me being subsQquently attacked in a published.  statenent by that organisation for having given "insult to the  resistance ~ovemant".

similarly ..,i th the Palestinians, o! whom ! met senior PLO  Adviser Dr Nabil Shaath in Cai~o, a group of senior PLO

Officials led by Bishop Eli a Knoury in A.nunan, and a group led  by Faisal HUsseini ~nd Hanan Ashra'Wi in Jerusalem: in all  those conversations I went out of my way to talk about

Australia 1 s long standing problems Ã¢Â‘.;i th the PLO - not least  the continuing language of its Covenant, the PLO's performance  during the Gulf Crisis, and the erratic quality over the yaars  of the com.mi tmQnt to moderation of so l!lany of. its leadera. I

spoke constantly . of our abhorrence of terrorism and violence  in any shape or form including both attacks on Jewish

civilians and the continuing ugly scale of. G~llaborator  killings - and of the contribution the Pal~stiniane could make  to the peace process by doing eve~~ing within their power to

13

curtail absolutely, and once and !or all, tha actions o!  extremiits within th~ir rar~s.

Hake no lllistake about it: while I have cri ticisQd Israel's

human rights exces:ses in the Occupied Territories, I am well  aware of the authoritarian and undemocratic nature o! most of  the otl1ar govttrnmants in the region and have criti.cise -cl  thltlir excesses. I know too that democracy's roote are much  daep "r in IsraQJ than elsewhere in the region and t..hat the  democratic proces~ in Israel itself is admirably robuat and  vigorous. My criticisms of Israel's hUDan rights per!or.mance

in the territories should be seen in that total context.

Let ~e also take this opportunity once and for all to set the  reco:rd straight otl just what I said, and why I ~aid it, on the  subject of United Nations GGneral .l,.ase..mbly Resolution 194  'Jhich deals of course ..,.ith both the status of Jerusalem and

the question o! the "right of return" o! displaced.

Palestinians. I have to say that th$ headlines and presa  stories generated on this subject ware nothing short of  extr~ordinary, in particular those suggestinq that I had

so::~~how initiated discussion of the whole subjClct i!.nd was

eng~ged in nothing less than promoting the s~,.,Ã¢Â‘amping of tlodern

day Israel by a nase of Arab returnees. The truth is quit.;  othervise, but unhappily the highly coloured reporting on this  issue, not least in the Jewish press, c~t~inly cast a

negative pall ov&r the much of the re&t of my visit, and seams  to have made a major contribution to the strong e.Inotions  g~nerated by it within the AuBtralian Jewish community,

~~at happened was simply this. The US State Departcent

spokesperson, Margaret Tutwiler, had answ~red a question on  Resolution 194 a day or so before I arrived in Iiiri!.wl. The  issue was all ovor the Israeli press as a result, and it was,  naturally, the subject of virtually the first question I was

asked after I arrived. I said that Australia, like-th$ United  States, had supported 194 at the time it was passed, and in  principle subsequently 1 but that it was a complex and

14

sen&itiv " issue -which 'Would have to be looked at in the !ull  context of tha peaca process. I a lao mAde the point that 194  specified compensation as an alternative to repatriation.  R&turn ~ comp&nsation is tha choica, and presumably this samQ  choicG should apply in principle to thG hundrGds of thousands  of Jews displaced at the same tLme !rom Arab countries,

::ueaning that Isra9l might ".Jell come out ahsad i! competinq

clailr .s  ",.;erG to ~ properly balanced. 'I'he irony is that I had  made essGntiall-y all tr.ase sa.me points before on the public  record, in answers given in the Senat " in May 1990 and

Septenber 1991: on both those occasions th~y disappeared  without trace (ev~n, I think, in the pages o! my indefatigable  friend Michael Danby's Australia Israel Review). But in May  1992 they caused an explosion!

Of course, like tlla statue of Jerusalem i tsel!, the question  of the PalQstinian right of return is an extrQ.lnely difficult  and delicate issue. Resolutions 242 and 338 are tile primary  issuts in ~~a peace proces~ and, as I haVQ said, the basis tor  th " current negotiating agenda. RQaolution 194 is not  directly on that aganda, and the unreality of wholesale return  must be ac.kno'.lll~dged, as I believe it is by many Palestinian

lQaders. But it see:me inevitable that the issues rais~d by  194 will at least have to be address~ by ths negotiating

parties, if only in the multilatsral working group on  refugQes, before thQ peace negotiations are finally co~pleted.

While dealing with the accumulated brickbats o! the last  couple of months, this is pe-rhaps also the placs t.o say a  little l!lore about the Australian Govern:ment 1 s policy towards  the PLO. Life would be easier for a good many of ue if we no

longer had to regard the PLO and its current leadership as a  relevant player in the Israeli-Palestinian peacQ process.  rrom the :Pal "stinians 1 own perspective, other spokesp&rsons  have emerged who are less weighed do~ by the baggage of thQ  past, mor " consistently moderatG in the way they express  themselves and certainly more attractive to the international

community. It is difficult to contest the proposition that

Hanan Ashrawi has done mora

sympa~etic und~rstanding !or

in twel Ylil months  tile Palestinian

to genera t a  cause than

But the truth of the matter ie that the PLO doea still sGam to  repreee::~t tile aspirations of. most Pal~;tinians, hoth in the

Occupied Territories and in the Palestinian dia::>pora, and it  is playing a significant role in the peace negotiations,  albeit inc:Hrectl_Y and behind t.lie scenes. ThQre is regular  contact D9tween the Palestinian delegation to the peace talks  and the PLO, as the .....,hole world no._, knows after thlil much  publicised recl#nt :meeting in Am.It.an. It does Itake sense,

accordingly 1 for those countries who are trying not only to  make sens " of that process but also to help it generatlil  constructlve outcomes, tc keep so:one lines of coll!l:l unication  '

open with the PLO and to use t-l-J.em so !ar as possible to  influence the Organisation in a modarate direction.

Australia's policy is no,.,Ã¢Â‘, as it was before the Gulf Crisis,  to be prepared to engage in dialogue with the PLO at both  ministerial and official levels it that dialogue ~aems likely  to ~ productive, We regard the PLO as a non-monolithic body

in which, for the woment at least, the ~oderates are

ascendant. W " will deal 'With the PLO to the extent that by  doing so ~;~e can encourage those genuinely CC!!llll.i ttQQ to the  peace process. OUr policy in all t..~es~ respects is right in  the mainstream of WQstern practice. h~ile ~e do r~cognise the  Palestinians' right to selt-dQtarmination and, i! they so

choosa, to an independent etate, ~e do not recognise any  existing 11State of Palastine" and WQ certainly do not  racoqnis& the PLO as the gover~ent of such a state. ~e have

no plans to give the PLO any mora formal recognition, and no  plans to change the current level or inte.nei ty of contacts  with it.

The Dlturc

Hi

What, tr.~n, o! the ruture? I continua to belitva - as I said  to the public m;eting two y~ars ago, and as r put it to all my  Jewish intQ..rlocutors in Israel - that the lr'is~et utterance  about I~rael's Pal "stinian dilamma was that ot David Ben  Gurion 45 years ago. He said in effect that Israel could be a  Jewish state; it could be a damocratic state; it could be a  5tate occupying the wholQ of the historical IsraQl; but it  could not be all thrGa. He persuaded his !lGdgling nation in

1947 to acc "pt two-and-a-half o! the objectives: a Jewish and  And it is democratic state occupying part of E:retz Israel.

tne task of the present generation of leader& to persuade  or maybe. 2025  ~aintains its

Israelis to make the 5ame choice now. By 2015,  if Rutisian and oth~r immigration resumes and  peak, the A.rab population o! Israel and the Occupied  Terri tor ies -will outnUit\.be.r i::.he Je;,;rish. 'I'he situation in the

territories has sho~ how hard it is no-w to maintain just and  democratic standards when confronted by a largely hostile  population. Without territorial compromisQ, unless Israel is  p~epared to relinquish its Jewish identity its claims to be a

damocracy lr'ill be sorely eroded.

This is a perception which is now 1 happily 1 returning to the  mainstrsal1l. of Israeli thinking. You will no doubt be. as  fascinated as I 'Was to hav~ read that a recent poll of all  retired IDF generals, plus thos~ of equivalent rank in Shin  Bat and Massad, indicated that a significant majority - almost

75 per cant - would be prepared to return to Jordan or to the  Palestinians most ot the West Bank provi~ed agreement could bQ  reached on appropriate security arrangements. Further, around

70 per cent of them ~lieved that a land !or pQaCQ dQ~l could

also be struck lr'ith Syria on the Golan, and more than halt  said they ~ould be prepared to accept a Palestinian state if  security and economic guarantees 'WQrQ provided. These are not  the judqmQnts o! a Foreign Minister from a lonq way away, or  of. an academic in an ivory tower, but ot those who haVQ had  thQ responsibility to physically defend the nat-ion's very

txistence.

17

Th& l!loet overvh~lming evidence that l6raelis ara ooming to

terms with the real choices con!ronting them, an~ the historic  opportunity !or laGting peace that the ending o! the Cold War  and the resolution of the Gulf War have creat$d 1 is ot course

the outcome o! last month's elections. It is in no partisan  spirit that I welcome tha victory of a !rat~rnal Labour Party.  It is because I bQliGve - as most Israelis apparsntly believe  - that this change was t.he only way that I~r~el could haul

itself back from, the edge of the abyss.

Yi tzht.k Rabin was right when he wrote before the election  that:  ioi"hat vill be dQcided is th~ fate of Israel ana the

road it will follo~,o; in t..-,e coming year~,,,, We are

facing a cross-roads in the history of the, state of  Israel and thQ Jewish people, For the first time,  after ~ore than 100 years of bloodshed and terror  " ".  there is a chance !or conciliation bet~ean ourselves  and the Arab ~orld.  He ~ent on to say that

\o'e mus~ ~eize this hour of grace vi th both hands.

We must embark on sarious negotiations towards

~Qcisions and agrQaments: first laadinq to the

e$tablishment of An autonomy in the territories,  then to a p$rmanent peace settlsmant.  He ack.no\r'ledged that territorial compromise involves painful

concessions, and emphasised that it does not mean giving up  security. HQ said clearly that  the ba.l."gaining will be bi ttQX, difficult and  merciless, There will bQ harsh a.rgunenta, and we

shall insist that our vital security interests arQ  not compromised. But finally, we shall come hoii:e  with the peace for which we are all y~arning.

ThQ Qffect of Raoin' s election, and. the real commi tmant he  will immediately inject at least into the self ~government  negotiations, will be to immediately swing the spotlight back  to the other side of the table. It will be the turn of the

18

Palestinian and the Arab states to take y~e for an answer,  Their bona !ides ~ill be under as close scrutiny as Israel's  ever were.

I happen to beliQVe that they will risQ to the occasion - that

there are so many ordinary Palestinians and so many ordinary  A.rabs in neigh.bourinq countries 'ft "ho do WMt peace and

prosperity for themselves and thQir children tbat th$y will  not let tha extr~ists in their ~idst snatch it from tham once  again. I believe that if solid progress is quickly zr.ade on  the s~lf-govermuant issues this will inject new moi!lentum to  the ot.har curre..nt negotiations, both bila+;.~ral and

i:llultilateral, and this in turn will fGed back moroentu.m and  dynazr.ism into tha next round ot bilateral negotiations -wh~n  they fall due with the Palestinians - creating an atmospherQ  in which there will ~ a very real prospect Ã¢Â‘of ultiJnat$ly  bridging the gap, that still now seelils so wide, betw~en the  two aides on the pe~anent status question. The trouble with

the previous Government's policy on 5ettlaments was that it  ~as so confidenca-de2troying. What I think we can look

forvard to under thQ new Government is the gradual evolution  of a ssries o! gGnuine confidence-building steps, leading  gradually but ultimately to lasting pQace.

I don't think it is naive to grasp at this chanca for p~ace in  the ~ay that Yi tzhak Rabin seems now determined to, with the  kind o! objectives and the kind of strategy I have just  descri.bQd, But it would be naive to do eo in a way that

ignored the risks along tha way, against which risks no-~ne  should relax guard. In particular:

the past behaviour of Palestinian extremists both within  and outside the PLO, and indeed the erratic behaviour o!  the ?LO leadership itselt .over many years, suggests ample  danger yet ahead. Post election killings by Palestinian  rejectionists clearly delnonstrate that thQ Ã¢Â‘ election in /.

itself, even if it is followed by rapid progress in  negotiations, c~nnot and will not solve all the problQm!.

19

The continued lilupport !or ~xtre'l!lism within the OccupiQd  Territories, most notably by Hamas, will continue to be a  series obstacle to the peace process;

Syria continues to have a QUbstantial military force  including SCUD missiles, an~ its past attitude toward the  peace proCQSs over many years undarstanda.bly does not  inspire total cor.fidenca that is now completely committed  to the curr "nt negotiations; ~d

!ran 1 s publicly restated determination to stand outside  a.nd beyond any peace process, to continuQ to challenge  tbe very ~xistence of Israel, and to continue to support  organisations like Hezbollah, again does nothing to  contribute to regional confidence-building.

It is the case that throughout the region, evQn no\o/adays in  Iran, there are forces of. moderation and pragmatis1n at work,  forces genuinely co1n.nitted to lasting peace, and it is up to  tha international community to er.gage ana encourage them as I  &ought to do in my own visit to the rQgion. But wt.~are any

country or community in the region falls short of the  behavioural standard~ and the commitmant necessary to move the  peace proCQSS forward, it !kust expect to ~ criticised by the  international coiniDuni t.y. That is what .Australia has done in  the past, both robustly and even-handedly, and ia what we must.

and ~ill continue to do in the future.

There is a special bond betwaen Australia and Israel, and  espGcially between those Israelis and Australiane who share  tho social democratic ideals that so governed the life and  ir.tsllect of the new nation at the time of its founding and  beyond. It has been a bond forged ;d th an acutely keen  consciousness on our part of 'Khat thEl founding of Ilirael  r.eant, and continues to moan, to the Jewish peopl~ all over  thQ world.

20

It ha& b Â¨en a bDnd much reinforced for ~e pGrsonally and my  gengrntion by our knowing, as ve do so well ancl so cloG ely  from our school and university days, so m~ny of the first  poet-Holocaust generation of AUgtrali~~ Jews. They ~erQ kids,  now me~ and ~omen, whose grandparents and uncles and aunts and  cousin~ and fal!lily frignds ver& slaught~ed ir. Hitler'~ gas

chambers and killing fields; vho felt the ~vtul ~llotional  "''eight of this history constantly ~pon th~i ~ho were

determined - as Jews are ever~here - to ensurg that it never  'happens again i 'and Yho are com.:mi tted above a 11 else to Israel  as L~e e~odiment of that conscious~ess, that pride, and that

determination.

Ho-one who has had, as I havti. had, this kind of bcndinq

experience, and no-one '*'ho has been moved, as l have bean  moved, by seeing the ~magas o! ~.e Kristallnacht or Warsaw at  Yad VaEhem, or by standing, as I did last year, outside Kiev  by the ravine at Babi Yar 1 could pO$Sibly be indi!farent to

the fate of tbi& land, this state, created to right centuries  of gri~vous wrong do~e to the Je~ish people.

It is not because ot ~y indifference, lQt alone my hostility,  that I responded as I did in May. It wÃ¢Â‘as because of my

distress, and my dQspair, at what S9amed ~~en likely to be the  imminent colla9se ot all that roattered about thg Jewish dream.  Mercifully, I think that time has now pa~sed, and that ~e can,  together 1 dre~ again.
