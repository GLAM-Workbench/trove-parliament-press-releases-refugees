AUSTRALIAN SUPPORT FOR VICTIMS OF THE CRISIS IN FORMER YUGOSLAVIA

$300,000 earmarked in March by the Australian Government for victims of the crisis in the former Yugoslavia will be distributed through United Nations agencies, the Minister for Development Cooperation, Gordon Bilney, said today.

This brings to $1.35 million the total emergency humanitarian assistance provided to the former Yugoslavia since the crisis began.

The numbers in need in the former Yugoslavia have risen dramatically over the last few months," Mr Bilney said.

"In Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia, for example, more than three million people require emergency assistance. There are also many more in need in other parts of the former Yugoslavia.

"There is a serious shortage of affordable food and in some areas, both adults and children are suffering from malnutrition.

"The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has advised us that food is the highest priority need at present. Over the weeks and months ahead, the most pressing need is for basic necessities such as food and medicine.

"Australian assistance will be channelled through United Nations agencies who are well placed to deliver assistance'in an independent, neutral and impartial manner.

"We will provide $200,000 to UNHCR for emergency food supplies and $100,000 to the United Nations Children's Fund for services to women and children," Mr Bilney said.
