“Greenprint Illawarra” launch in Cunningham

Michael Organ, the Australian Greens candidate for the Cunningham by-election and Senator Bob Brown have launch their party’s key election manifesto for Cunningham, Greenprint Illawarra.

Michael Organ said, “The Greenprint Illawarra is an optimistic plan for the regions future.

“We are serious about making changes on the ground to achieve quality of life, economic equity, conservation and a decent society.

“Since 1996 Bob Brown has used the Senate as a platform for campaigning on issues of global responsibility such as refugees and alternatives to an oil war against Iraq.

“The Greens now need to break through to the lower house to create political change at the local community level,” Michael Organ said.

Bob Brown said, “the package takes the Illawarra from the old polluting industries into becoming a hub for production of environmentally sound manufactures for sale throughout Australia and the Asia Pacific Region.”

Highlights from the package include:

Ã¢ÂÂ Taxes and incentives for a transition to green jobs Ã¢ÂÂ Feasibility study for light rail Ã¢ÂÂ Protection and then promotion of an Escarpment Regional Park Ã¢ÂÂ Strengthening the community through better schools

Ã¢ÂÂ Conservation of Sandon Point heritage values Ã¢ÂÂ New industries such as high energy-efficiency electric motor, public transport vehicles and solar heaters.

“In this last week, I feel proud that the nation is taking the by-election so seriously and I think that it has really put Wollongong on the map in a positive way,” said Mr Organ.
