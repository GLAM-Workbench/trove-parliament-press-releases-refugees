HOWARD SINKS TO NEW LOW ON ASYLUM SEEKERS



The Prime Minister has sunk to a new low with his assertion this  morning that asylum claims from the 14 Kurds who arrived at Melville  Island last week were irrelevant, Cunningham MP Michael Organ said  today.

"John Howard's claim that 'At the time any so-called application for  asylum might have been made, the islands had been excised' is the  height of hypocrisy," Mr. Organ said.

"The Prime Minister knows full well that the excision of the Tiwi  Islands was applied retrospectively, and when these unfortunate  individuals arrived, Melville Island was still part of the Australian  migration zone."

"Over recent days Immigration Minister Amanda Vanstone and Foreign  Minister Alexander Downer denied that any claim for refugee status had  been made."

"After admitting these denials are wrong, John Howard compounds the  falsehood by claiming that it's irrelevant because of the retrospective  excision of Melville Island."

"This government seems incapable of telling the truth", Mr. Organ said.
