Subjects: Carbon pricing, plain packaging legal action, Liberal Party presidency, Scott  Morrison's Malaysian trip

KIERAN GILBERT: Joining me now on the program from Melbourne, Labor frontbencher,  Richard Marles, and from Adelaide, Liberal MP, Jamie Briggs. Gentlemen, good morning.

RICHARD MARLES: Good morning, Kieran.

JAMIE BRIGGS: Good morning.

KIERAN GILBERT: Jamie, first to you. A carbon tax compensation package gradually  coming out, the detail. This will make the whole plan more palatable, won't it?

JAMIE BRIGGS: Well, there is no detail. We don't know the price, so you can't have a  genuine discussion about this until you know the price. Yesterday we saw the Assistant Prime  Minister, Bob Brown, on the Insiders program say that he wants to see the end of the coal  industry. Now, that's a price of over a hundred bucks a tonne. If that's the case, that's going to  have enormous impacts.

But whatever the price is, we know that the cost of living for the forgotten families  throughout Australia will be massively increased. We've just heard Wayne Swan confirm that  then. He just said in your interview with him, Kieran, that with the introduction of a carbon

price there will be increases to the cost of living. They've just admitted the exact point that  Tony Abbott has been making for some time.

On the other hand, we say you can address the challenge of climate change with a direct  action policy and at the same time we can offer at the next election a genuine tax-cutting  policy because that's what the Liberal Party's always believed in.

KIERAN GILBERT: Richard, I want to ask you about the point Jamie made there, and it's  something that a number of people have been referring to today, the comments of Bob Brown  yesterday. Doesn't that distract from your effort to try and get the focus on compensation, on  assisting households when you've got the Greens making those sorts of statements about not  wanting compensation for the coal industry and so on?

RICHARD MARLES: Well, Bob Brown's comments are a matter for him. What we've  made clear is that this package will have industry assistance in it but it will also have  assistance to ordinary households.

And what we've heard the Prime Minister and now the Treasurer say in the last 24 hours is  that for the three million lowest income households in Australia, which is actually a fair  proportion of the country, they will be fully compensated for any increase in the cost of living  and more with a 20 per cent buffer. So they'll actually be better off under this plan and you  know where the money's coming from, that's because this is a…

KIERAN GILBERT: But there's still no detail, is there. As Jamie said, there's still no detail.

RICHARD MARLES: But you know what this is about, this is about putting a price on  carbon to be paid by the thousand largest emitters of CO2 in the country. That stands in pretty  stark contrast to what we've just heard Jamie say about tax cuts the Liberal Party will put in.  The basis of those tax cuts, as far as I could tell from what Jamie said, is simply that the  Liberals believe in it. But we haven't seen any proof of where they're going to find the  savings. I mean, these people couldn't find savings if their lives depended on it.

We saw that last week when there was a budget measure put through the Parliament which  saved a couple of billion dollars. The Liberals objected to that; that's fair enough. But when  they went off to then try and find where they could find alternative savings, they couldn't, and  so they ended up voting for it.

These people could not find savings if their lives depended on it. In fact, they didn't find  savings when their lives depended on it during the last election when we found there was an  $11 billion black hole in their budget costings. You know, for Tony Abbott…

KIERAN GILBERT: Why not - okay, well, let's get Jamie's thoughts on, you know, the  point that you're making there, particularly in light of what Wayne Swan told me in that  interview, and that is that he's going to write to Joe Hockey today and Tony Abbott offering  the resources of Treasury to cost the Coalition commitments, Jamie.

JAMIE BRIGGS: Well, if Wayne Swan was serious he'd release all the modelling that  they've done on their carbon tax, which of course he won't. So this is a stunt.

We've said for some time now - and in fact it was when Malcolm Turnbull was the  Opposition Leader there was an announcement from our side that we support the introduction  of a parliamentary budget office which looks at genuine - gives a genuinely independent,  such as the Congressional Budget Office in the United States.

So at the end of the day, the Treasurer and the Prime Minister are trying to use the Treasury  as a political tool, which is actually a disgrace ultimately because Treasury is a high-quality

department and does a high-quality job for our country and it shouldn't be used in this low-rent political way.

But you understand. I mean, the Treasurer and the Prime Minister are under the pump. The  Prime Minister's out there trying to reassure her backbench with these announcements that  she - it's all going to be okay, we'll have lots of compensation, we'll be redistributing wealth,  that's what the Labor Party's always believed in, and you know, don't worry about, you know,  your marginal seats when you've got a primary vote of 27 per cent, we'll get you back there,  because she's worried that Bill Shorten's looking hungry, Combet's performing in Parliament

quite often. Even Simon Crean these days is out there.

So you know, what we've seen over the weekend is more about the Prime Minister trying to  ensure that the backbench doesn't walk away from us before the next election.

KIERAN GILBERT: Yeah, the leadership line there had a bit of credibility, Jamie, until  you mentioned Simon Crean. That comeback would be bigger than Lazarus, I think.

Richard, let's go to the issue that Jamie pointed to there on the use of Treasury. Is that not a  stunt, and is it inappropriate to use Treasury for that purpose?

RICHARD MARLES: Well, you can just see a little bit of cockiness there coming through  in Jamie's comments when he starts referring to the polls. I mean, normally we have a  bipartisan agreement not to refer to the polls, but there's some cockiness there on the Liberal  Party's side. But you keep that up, mate, that's fine.

JAMIE BRIGGS: No, no, no. I'm just looking at the odds [indistinct]…

RICHARD MARLES: We're focused on the ballot that counts, which is in a couple of  yearstime. Between now and then we're just interested in putting in place some good policy,  which is far removed from what we see on the Liberals side here.

Look, if the Liberals were serious about these miraculous kind of hocus-pocus tax cuts that  they're talking about, they would actually submit a proposition. They would submit a  proposition to the first-class outfit that Jamie has just described the Treasury as being.

Now, there's no stunt in that. What we're saying is you just can't walk around saying, "oh, tax  cuts here, tax cuts there and you can trust us because we believe in them," as if you can just  conjure these things out of thin air. You've actually got to put forward where the savings will  come from, and we all know that there are no savings being put forward here by the Liberal  Party…

KIERAN GILBERT: All right, okay, yeah, sorry to interrupt there, mate. We've got to take  a quick break. We'll be right back. Stay with us on AM Agenda.

[Ad break]

KIERAN GILBERT: Welcome back to the program. Philip Morris looks set to launch legal  action against the Government's bid to introduce plain packaging. I spoke to the Health  Minister, Nicola Roxon, about this and whether or not the Government has sought legal  advice on it.

[Excerpt from earlier interview]

NICOLA ROXON: Well look, we believe that we're on very solid grounds, and obviously  we've said from day one that when we [audio cuts out] world first action, which we believe  will be very effective, we knew that the tobacco companies would fight tooth and nail. You're  seeing that as they aggressively campaign in the media but also as they look at all their legal  options.

I don't believe we have any reason to be afraid of that. Obviously it's going to be a long  process but we are very determined to take this action which we believe can help reduce the  number of people that smoke and the harm caused by smoking, and we won't be deterred  from that course.

KIERAN GILBERT: Apparently Philip Morris is going to target a bilateral investment  treaty between Hong Kong and Australia because its parent company is based in Hong Kong.  Do you have any specific advice on that…

NICOLA ROXON: Well, I'm not going to discuss…

KIERAN GILBERT: …that course of action.

NICOLA ROXON: …in the media, you know, each and every bit of legal advice. Of course  our government takes advice and acts appropriately, but we believe that we are able, and the  Australian people I think would expect their government to be able to take action in the  interests of public health.

We know that this plain packaging step is a step that's recommended to be considered by  states, by the World Health Organisation, and we don't believe that that is - taking that action  is in breach of any of our international obligations.

KIERAN GILBERT: The bottom line is big tobacco is obviously concerned about a  precedent being set in Australia, isn't it?

NICOLA ROXON: Oh, well obviously they are concerned and it makes a case that they're  also trying, I think wrongly, to mount against us, which is that this won't be effective. You  can tell by the way that they are fighting that they are very afraid that this will be effective,  and if it is effective, that means we will be saving people's lives from what we know is a very  addictive and very dangerous product.

KIERAN GILBERT: I know you've got to jump on a plane, Health Minister. I'll let you go.  Appreciate it. Thanks for that.

NICOLA ROXON: Thank you.

[End of excerpt]

KIERAN GILBERT: Richard Marles and Jamie Briggs are with me on the program.

Richard, it looks like this could be quite a lengthy and potentially costly process, this, to fight  off the Big Tobacco on plain packaging.

RICHARD MARLES: We're not going to be intimidated by what Big Tobacco does. As the  Health Minister's just said, we knew that they would be vigorously opposed to this and they  will fight this with every fibre of their being. But that's fine; we're ready for that fight. Unlike  the Liberal Party, we're not influenced by Big Tobacco and we will see through what, as the  Health Minister said, is a world first.

But, you know, what we want to see is cancer rates drop in this country. We want to see a  healthier Australia. And the foundation of our action is [break in transmission] on the public  health of this country and we feel very solid in that foundation.

KIERAN GILBERT: Jamie, I'll let you respond to that because I think, you know, I'm  correct in saying that the Liberal parties don't [indistinct] this plain-packaging initiative.

JAMIE BRIGGS: Well, I just wonder whether Nicola Roxon had any intention of telling  Philip Morris that she planned this course of action when she invited them to her fundraiser a  couple of years ago, or when she went to the tennis with them not long before that.

So for Richard to sit there and suggest that somehow we've been bought off by tobacco  donations is a bit of a joke.

At the end of the day I suspect what Philip Morris is doing - and what they do is a matter for  them - but I suspect what they're doing is taking a chance that this government will  implement this policy as incompetently as it implements pretty much every other policy. It  can't implement a policy to put roof batts in people's houses, to build school halls. Philip  Morris is throwing a dice that they won't be able to do this properly either and there'll be  some problem with it. It's probably not an unreasonable assumption.

KIERAN GILBERT: Jamie, there was a…

RICHARD MARLES: But you're meant to be supporting it, Jamie. I thought the Liberal  Party's actually supporting what we're doing now.

JAMIE BRIGGS: Well, what we would say, though, Richard, is that we don't think you can  competently implement anything. You had Nicola Roxon trying to prosecute a case that the  Liberal Party is guilty by association from taking donations only for it to turn out that what's  Nicola Roxon been seeking to do…

RICHARD MARLES: But are you taking donations now…

JAMIE BRIGGS: … [laughs]…

RICHARD MARLES: … is my question; are you taking them now?

JAMIE BRIGGS: Ah, well…

RICHARD MARLES: And that's why…

JAMIE BRIGGS: …Nicola - you know, the nea…

RICHARD MARLES: … you can't emphatically support what we're doing…

JAMIE BRIGGS: … the Dear Nicola - the Dear Philip letter that we saw Nicola write, you  know; Dear Philip, please come to my - please come to my fundraiser…

RICHARD MARLES: Ah, yeah, but if you weren't…

JAMIE BRIGGS: … you know [laughs]…

RICHARD MARLES: … if you weren't getting support from them now, you'd be  supporting us in a much bigger way than you did with that answer, brother.

KIERAN GILBERT: Okay, let's…

JAMIE BRIGGS: That's completely…

KIERAN GILBERT: … let's move on gentlemen…

JAMIE BRIGGS: … that's complete… that is absolutely offensive, Richard. I mean, to  suggest…

KIERAN GILBERT: Okay…

JAMIE BRIGGS: … that somehow donations are corruptible, I mean, there - then, we'll just  start walking through who else…

KIERAN GILBERT: Jamie…

JAMIE BRIGGS: … donates to the Labor Party, shall we?

KIERAN GILBERT: I've got to ask you - I've got to ask you one last issue, gents, but we've  got a couple of minutes left and I want to get through it.

Jamie, the Liberal Presidency, quite a stoush at the weekend, and interesting from your  leader; he backed publicly Peter Reith but then voted for Alan Stockdale and showed him the  ballot that, yes, he had backed the incumbent. What was going on there?

JAMIE BRIGGS: I think he backed the contest; I'm not sure he ever backed a particular  candidate. I can - correct me if I'm wrong there, but I never saw an endorsement of either  candidate.

But look, we - Kieran, we shouldn't get ahead of ourselves; let's just explain to Richard what  a ballot is. Richard, that's where you have two people; you have a whole series of people who  actually vote; you count the ballots and one's a winner and one's not. So it's - I know it's a  very different concept to what Labor Party go through.

But we think competition is worthwhile; and I think already you've seen the benefits of  competition because you're seeing some discussion about reform and so forth from either of  the candidates. And I'm sure, from my perspective, I'm sure Peter Reith - who is a great of  our party - will remain involved and will remain offering his substantial views into the  future.

KIERAN GILBERT: I'm sure Peter Reith would be pleased to see his former colleague  [indistinct] him like that on our cameras.

RICHARD MARLES: That's - but Kieran, Peter Reith certainly knows now that Tony  Abbott is a weather vane; he knows that from first hand experience.

But in terms of competition, you know, what we've seen here is a contest between Nick  Minchin and Peter Reith; this is kind of climate-change sceptic versus dogs at the waterfront.  I mean, this is a horror movie of the worst proportions…

JAMIE BRIGGS: [Laughs]…

RICHARD MARLES: … and Australia should be - if there was any question about the  lurch of the Liberal Party to the right, it was certainly answered this weekend.

JAMIE BRIGGS: Ah, dear me.

KIERAN GILBERT: [Break in transmission] be hoping that Peter Reith will continue the  case on workplace reform, wouldn't you, Jamie? You've been an advocate of that and Peter  Reith has suggested that he will be pushing ahead arguing the case for the Liberal Party and  the Coalition to grab that issue again.

JAMIE BRIGGS: Well, look, Peter Reith has been a substantial figure in our party; he was  responsible for the development of very good policy, a policy that saw the creation of jobs,  the freeing up of our economy, flexibility he introduced into our economy; and when Peter  Reith speaks people should listen. He's got a lot of wise words to say and, you know, I  certainly take what Peter Reith says very seriously.

And it's always interesting, you always know when someone's a substantial figure on our side  because those on the other side, like Richard, are so desperate to try and attack them that they  will go to any gutter to do that attacking from.

KIERAN GILBERT: Okay, just quickly, one…

RICHARD MARLES: Sounded like a return to WorkChoices, from my point of view.

KIERAN GILBERT: Yeah, well, everything does to you guys, you're always trying to…

JAMIE BRIGGS: Break glass in case of emergency, Richard. Break the glass…

RICHARD MARLES: Yeah, but you're breaking it for us…

JAMIE BRIGGS: … in case of emergency.

RICHARD MARLES: You keep running there.

[Laughter]

KIERAN GILBERT: All right, gents, just quickly, we've only got a minute left on the  program; I want to get your thoughts quickly on the Malaysia issue. Scott Morrison's there at  the moment prosecuting - well, you know, on a fact-finding mission.

Richard, some refugee advocates there on the ground critical of both sides of politics on this  and certainly very critical of the government's policy as well. We've got less than a minute  left on the program if you could just give me your quick thoughts on that.

RICHARD MARLES: Scott Morrison hasn't met with a single official of the Malaysian  government - not that they would influence his view anyway. He said that he wasn't going to  change his mind before he went there.

He's broken a bipartisan commitment to become part of Team Australia when you leave our  shores, and that is a disgrace.

KIERAN GILBERT: Okay, Jamie, just quickly.

JAMIE BRIGGS: Scott's doing what Chris Bowen should have done and gone and had a  look for himself. Chris Bowen sitting back in his ivory tower and making policy which won't  work, policy which will diminish our internat… [break in transmission] reputation.

And where is Kevin Rudd in all this, Richard's boss? Where is Kevin Rudd? I think he's over  in another country seeking a UN vote, rather than in Indonesia or in Malaysia seeking to  resolve what are quite substantial

RICHARD MARLES: He's being the Minister for Foreign Affairs.

KIERAN GILBERT: All right, gents…

JAMIE BRIGGS: Not being involved in the foreign affairs issues; can you imagine?

RICHARD MARLES: Foreigners live overseas, mate.

KIERAN GILBERT: Gentlemen, thank you for that. That's all we've got time for and thank  you for your company on AM Agenda as well. We'll see you next time.
