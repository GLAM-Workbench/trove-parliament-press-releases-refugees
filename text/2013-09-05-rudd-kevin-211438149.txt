Election campaign; Labor’s plan for the future; Pre-polling; Asylum seeker  policy.  _____________________________________________________________



PM: Well Mr Abbott has been leader for four years of the Liberal Party, he’s had  five weeks in an election campaign and now, 36 hours before polling day, we still  have no comprehensive list of his major cuts to jobs, health and education. So if  you have doubts about that don’t vote for him

JOURNALIST: Moving on to the polls obviously you were reinstated as Prime  Minister and your Party with the faith that you would re-invigorate the Party into  this election. Your popularity now is not too dissimilar to Julia Gillard’s was, why  do you think that is?

PM: Election campaigns are tough and you can analyse the polls any day of the  week that you so choose, my purpose on your program is to explain our policies  and they’re out there for all to see. Building Australia’s economic future, building  the jobs of the future, the schools of the future and building also the hospitals of  the future, the broadband of the future - it’s all out there. There properly costed.  And the alternative is clear in each one of those categories; cutting jobs, cutting  schools, cutting hospitals, cutting broadband and that’s the alternative plan. So  when we get to the election on Saturday that’s for everyone to make up their  mind in a proper and democratic fashion. In the meantime all the commentary I’ll  leave to you guys, you’re much better at it than the rest of us.

JOURNALIST: But why aren’t the policies translating?

PM: That’s a question for you to answer yourself

JOURNALIST: How do you feel about it - how do you feel about the policies?

PM: I feel that I’ve got a responsibility as Prime Minister to explain what we’re  offering to your listeners. What we’re offering to them about their jobs, their  schools, their hospitals, their broadband, their clean energy future - all those sort  of things, where we have not just a slogan. We have a detailed operation plan,  fully funded, fully costed, rolling it out.

JOURNALIST: But so many people have voted already and it’s not looking great  for Labor at the moment

PM: How do you know that? Do you have access to the ballot boxes do you?  Would you take her name and address and we’ll just sort that out.

JOURNALIST: I’ve got the secrets tucked away don’t worry.

PM: That’s the bottom line, its - well I’ve been right around the country and I get  all sorts of interesting and positive remarks from people who’ve been staffing our  pre-polling booths. In terms of the response to the Government and to the Labor

Party in pre-polling and I think you folk might be interested - maybe getting ready  for a bit of a surprise on Saturday night, in terms of the resilience of our members  and the resilience of our party despite everything that gets thrown against us.

JOURNALIST: You have lurched to the right though with your asylum seeker  policy.

PM: Well you might assert that. Can I say we just increased the number of  refugees coming to this country from 12,000 to 20,000. The other side of politics  has reducing that now to 12,000. We hold open the prospect of increasing that  further to 27,000 depending on the success of our implementation of the regional  resettlement arrangement. So we’re also around the world including in places like  Syria providing on top of that massive funding to the United Nations High  Commissioner for Refugees to deal with the problem way beyond on shores as  well. So on the question of supporting the cause of refugees around the world,  we are proud of what we’re doing, there are difficult choices we have had to  make here domestically but we believe we have got the balance right in terms of  ensuring border security on the one hand, putting the people smugglers out of  business over time on the other. And providing good support for refugees on the  way through.
