Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and Border Protection

Michael Keenan

Minister Clare must come clean on Customs corruption

16/01/13

Almost one month after disturbing revelations of extensive corruption within the Australian Customs and Border  Protection Service it appears that suspected corrupt baggage handlers are still working at Sydney Airport,  Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and Border Protection Michael Keenan said.

“It is unacceptable for known, suspected individuals to continue working in highly sensitive positions when they  have links to alleged drug traffickers and are suspected of being involved in serious corrupt activities,” Mr Keenan  said.

“I have written to the Minister for Home Affairs Jason Clare MP requesting a briefing on the corruption within  Customs and have called on the Minister to reassure Australians that corrupt officials will not continue to work at  Sydney Airport or any other airport within Australia.

“Minister Clare cannot allow this kind of corrupt activity to fester and needs to come clean on what exactly is  going on within Customs,” Mr Keenan said.

“The Australian people deserve answers about the Government’s mismanagement of our premier border  protection agency and the damaging funding and personnel cuts Labor has inflicted on Customs since coming to  office.

“The funding cuts and holes in our border protection system have clearly been exploited by these criminal  syndicates - Minister Clare must immediately act to ensure no further known corrupt individuals continue to work  at our airports.”

“Full answers need to be given before the Australian public can rebuild confidence in our border protection  system that this incompetent Government have worked so hard to dismantle and cripple,” Mr Keenan said.
