TRANSCRIPT OF DR JOHN HENSON HP  INTERVIEW WITH JOHN LAWS  RADIO 2UE

SUBJECTS: Immigration, Metherall Affair

Laws:

John Hewson.  I was going to talk to you about this  immigration thing...

Hewson:

Yes.

Laws :

...so I'm glad that we've got you there.  What are your  thoughts on this?

Hewson:

Well,  I think Gerry Hand's admission last night that the  20,000 Chinese students could grow to 300,000 by the Year 2000  is a national disgrace.  Hand has obviously decided to put  Keating right in a corner. He obviously has never supported

this decision.  And as you said John, it's a double standard.  The facts are that 20,000 Chinese students who arrived before  June 1989 have basically been given the opportunity to stay

here as long as they like,  and the decision is theirs.  Yet  other Chinese students - about 15-18,000 - who arrived after  June 1989 have to go through the normal refugee procedure. So  there's even discrimination within the Chinese student

category - a decision originally based entirely on Bob Hawke's  emotions,  and now being continued by Paul Keating's  expediency.

It's a national disgrace.  I can't, in any way,  defend that  decision.  I'd say to you John, it doesn't really matter  whether they're Chinese or French or anything else - to  undermine the integrity of our immigration program like that

is a national disgrace.

Laws:

I just fail to be able to come to the terms,  as I said - I  might be stupid - we have all these Cambodians locked behind  wire, fighting to prove that they're refugees fleeing from  persecution which, in some instances, is obvious - allow them

at least to prove it. And yet we say it's OK, because the exÂ­  Prime Minister shed a tear about the Tiananmen Square  massacre, and of course we all should have quietly and  privately shed a tear about that. So we wind up with all

these people.  They can stay, and they can bring in 300,000  relatives over the next 8 years, and yet he says he's doing  something to tidy up the immigration problem.  That's not '   tidying it up. That is going to cause aggravation and  escalate racism, which already exists in Australia whether you

like it or not.

Hewson:

Well I think what Gerry Hand's done last night is to try to  come clean.  I mean, he's leaving politics and he doesn't want  to go out with this on his conscience, I'd say. And he's put  the acid back on Paul Keating because Keating has recently

re-confirmed that original decision of Hawke's, which we have  opposed from that day.  We think it's a nonsensical thing.  We  predicted the thing could blow out.  We had no idea it could  go to 300,000. That's the first time I've heard that number.

It's ludicrous John, and as you say, you've got Cambodians now  locked up, waiting to have their refugee status determined.  But within the Chinese student group, those who happened to  arrive before June 1989 have been given a blanket entry to

stay as long as they like, and the decision is theirs, and  those who arrived afterwards - another 15-18,000 - are being  treated like the Cambodians - going through the DORS procedure  to see whether they're genuine refugees.  It's the most

indefensible immigration decision in our history I would  think.

Laws:

Yes.  You see, and because he has said that migrants will now  have to pass an English test before they're allowed in, he's  going to cause more problems,  because that's going to draw its  share of detractors who see that as some sort of return to the  White Australia Policy. It seems to me he's done nothing

right.

Hewson:

No, well I think yesterday's specific decision was a joke too,  because you've got 30,000 cut and you've got 30,000 Chinese  students and dependents that you haven't counted,  so there's  no net change.  Secondly, as you pointed out before,  to play

down the significance of skills when surely we ought to be  looking at immigration from the point of view - beyond the  humanitarian considerations - we should be giving much greater  weight to skills, much greater weight to our labour market.  And it's only fair for those immigrants. Some 40-odd percent

of recently-arrived migrants are on some Government benefit.  You can't tell me that does those migrants any good, and you  can't tell me that does Australia any good.

Laws:

Well, it certainly doesn't do Australia any good, and at this  stage really, the migrants should be considered to be  secondary to the people who are already here. Now that might  sound like a hard comment, but I can't be too concerned if  people choose to come to Australia and then find they've got

to live on social security payments when they get here.  Tough. There are people here who have been here all their  lives, irrespective of what colour their skin might be, who  are out of work, who can't get a job. Now they should be the

prime concern. To hell with all these other people.

Hewson:

Well you certainly have to strike a balance. I agree with  you. To the extent that they arrive and they go on to the job  market, that's keeping people out of jobs who are in the  market at the present from looking for them. It's making it

harder for those who are already here to find a job. It's one  of the main reasons why you've got to cut the migrant intake  in the short term. We can all believe in the benefits of an  expanded immigration intake as the decade goes on and the

economy picks up. But right now, we can't absorb them. It's  replacing jobs in Australia. They're ending up on  unemployment benefits or other benefits which doesn't do them  any good. So the system's all wrong. It's not in the

interests of the migrants. It's‘not in the interests of those  in Australia who are looking for a job.

And right now it's not in the interests of Australia itself,  and it's about time that the Government really addressed the  issue of immigration from that sort of perspective rather  than, as you said, trying to buy political support and sustain  the political support of the ethnic groups, which is clearly  not in the best interests of either of those groups, I  believe, or in the best interests of Australia.

Laws:

No. Well I absolutely agree with that. 30,000 cut to 80,000  when you say we've got 30,000...

REF: TRANSCR\NM\S0088 4 .

Hewson:

Well,  it's in one pocket and out the other.  I mean, 30,000  down, but you've got 30,000 Chinese students at this point  which will grow to 300,000 that you haven't counted,

Laws:

Yes.

Hewson:

So where's the cut?

Laws:

There isn't a cut.  There isn't a cut,  What would you have  done?

Hewson:

Well, we've said all along that there ought to be a very  significant cut,  and in circumstances like this in the past,   in recessions like this, the numbers have dropped to about 50  to 75 or 80,000 net, but with a greater emphasis on skills.

It's no use adding people to the job market if they're going  to replace people... take jobs that would otherwise have gone  to those who are already here.

Laws:

Or even worse, if they can't get a job at all.

Hewson:

If they can't get a job or they don't bring the skills this  country needs.  It's about time we took a hard-headed attitude  to this. You can be fair. You can be non-discriminatory, but  you've got to act in your best interests.

Laws:

Of course you have.  You've got to act in the best interests  of the country because that's all that matters.  And the first  people to be protected are the people who are already in  Australia, irrespective of from whence they came.  They're

already here. They need a job. They're the first to be  protected.

How much damage is Nick Greiner doing you?

Hewson:

In what sense John? In the Metherall affair?

REF: TRANSCR\NM\S0088 5.

Laws;

In any sense you like.

Hewson:

That's one of those classic questions, like when do you stop  beating your wife. It doesn't matter what I do, I've taken a  position.

But look, the point I made yesterday was a very simple. Our  standing in the polls has deteriorated most notably in New  South Wales,  And to some extent I think that reflects  expressions of opinion about the State political scene as much  as it reflects any expressions of opinion about us.

My own view is that as time goes on and the focus comes back  on us and what we want to do for this country, that poll  support will come back. That's really I was saying - that it  does impact on people's attitudes to Liberals generally, and

that sort of pulls us down in terms of the standing in some  measured polls.

Laws:

OK. As far as the Metherall affair is concerned, what's your  reaction to that and the ICAC?

Hewson:

Well John, I've had a consistent policy, and it's the only one  that you can adhere to, and that is that I don't get involved  in State politics. I don't tell Nick Greiner what to do and  Nick doesn't tell me what to do. Irrespective of what we  think, I think it's important that we stay out of each other's

turf and handle our problems at the Federal level...I handle  the Federal problems, he handles that State problems.

Laws:

OK. Well, we'll accept that.

Hewson;

OK.

Laws:

And in summary, what Gerry Hand has done is little.

REF: TRANSCR\NM\S0088 6.

Hewson:

Well, he's done nothing in terms of the immigration decision  announced yesterday, except last night his honesty about the  ludicrous nature of this decision on Chinese students has  really exploded the myth of a responsible immigration policy  on the part of this Government, and he's put the acid back on  Keating. Keating must explain why it should be that we should

have a special category of people - 20,000 originally that can  grow to 300,000, all at their discretion, in the midst of the  worst recession in 60 years.

Laws:

Yes. It doesn't seem to make much sense to me. Thanks for  your time. Good to talk to you.

Hewson:

Thanks John.

Ends.
