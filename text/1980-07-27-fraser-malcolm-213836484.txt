The second challenge, is the need to respond to the world  energy problem, responsibly# and with a sense of Australia1s  -future,

The third is the challenge of harnessing the nation’s  resources in a co-ordinated and responsible programme of  national development.

The fourth is t h e '  challenge "to make- sure that thisÂ· _  . development is not just development for its own sake; but  to see that it provides opportunities for as many Australians  b s  possible. *

And finally, our responsibility in domestic management  must be. complemented by a.concerned and responsible  stance in international affairs.

In all of these, we need to approach our task with the  determination to create a fairer# more just and more  tolerant society.. '

Of all these considerations, the responsible management  of the economy remains pre-eminent,Â· for without that we  will not be able, to reach our objectives. Â·

But our efforts must not be compromised.

It is only by maintaining the success of our fight against  inflation that we can secure sustainable-^connmlc...growth, Â·   that industries oan produce more# and employ more.

We remain unapologetio about our commitment to this goal, and  in the financial year just ended# the Government achieved the  largest ever recorded reduction in the Budget deficit. .

That ia not a bad effort; after all, it is only July.  And what will Mr. Hayden do .

when all his Shadow Ministers put in their bids?

After all, the A.L.P. Conference commits the Labor Party  to more than 150 programmes that are not accounted for : : in the figure of $2,000 million, and Mr. Hayden reminded ; u s , only as recently as June 27, that they are serious  about all these programmes t "What I do say is that we have  the sanction of. our platform to devise policies ... and we are  prepared to implement them as a Government." -Mr. Hayden is always careful to avoid telling-us— how h e    —  -is going to pay for all this.

But we do know that Mr, Keating said that Labor’s resources  -tax will col-leet more revenue than our current oil levy; ’ "The debate about resources taxes doesn’t matter^much to the motorist at all. What does matter is if, over time, the

resources tax does collect more than the levy - and I  expect it will.“

Mr. Hayden has been just as specific# reminding us last  December that his revenue raising programmes were: "Somewhat  more radical than had been outlined up to 1972.” = '  -

He warned us about our taxation future under Labor, when  he said: "...X have committed my organisation to a capital gains tax, a resources rental tax, a levy on domestic oil  producers, a number of initiatives in the tax.-arsA.and— ,—   other measures of that nature."

In what constitutes an elaboration of the “other measures"  — the. Opposition1 s Spokesman on Economic Affairs has said  that it -is "wrong" that we do not have "some form of tax on  capital, be it death duties# capital gains tax, wealth tax,

or perhaps some kind of combination of those# or all three."

We cannot say we have not been warned. ~  j  ~ * Â·--- -

We must thank Mr. Hayden for reminding us that Australia  cannot afford the Labor Party.

It is the containment of inflation that has made us ^   competitive at home and abroad? and won for Australian.   industry a new share in world markets. '  - . Â·

Ã¢ÂÂ  Â· / . Ã¢ÂÂ   Ã¢ÂÂ   I

This is reflected in the massive rise in our exports of  black coal and steaming coal that is predicted by the  International Energy Agency,

In steaming coal# for example, these are expected to rise  from the current level of 6 million tonnes per annum to Â·   34 million tonnes per annum by 1990,

It is because of Australia’s abundant coal reserves, and  in particular, our potential for cheaper coal-fired energy,  that our raw materials and energy are increasingly coming  together in a significant programme of mineral processing.

Ã¢ÂÂ  m

The Industry and Commerce survey shows that almost $5 billion  of aluminium projects are either under way or about to go.

i'Or soma time now, it has been tha Government’s concern that the development challenges of the decade ahead are —

adequately met.

In order to achieve this, the commonwealth, at three Loan  Council meetings since 19?8~, authorised the States to  proceed with almost $5 billion worth of projects, designed  to provide the facilities for accommodating our expanding  development.

These include construction and expansion of ports, coal loaders,  electricity generating facilities and pipeline development.

More than $1,3 billion is scheduled for Victoria, including the  massive increase in the capacity of the Loy Yang power station*

This extended capacity, together with Bass Strait development,  will make Victoria one of the energy rich States of Australia,  a facility which will act as a springboard to further developmen t .

What this activity suggests is that the energy crisis for much  of the industrialised world has become an energy opportunity  for Australia?----------- —

And we are responding positively and successfully to the  call for expanded energy and raw material development in  a world greatly in need of both.

This presents" na with the fourth challenge Â·- tcf. ÃÂ³. rrv.

that this development is not just development for its own sake", '  ~ yg but that it provides opportunities for as many Australians .  ^

as possible. '  ~  —  - .  _ .

This process is already under way as new job opportunities  are being created and Australia's employment growth shows  a marked improvementÃ¢ÂÂ .

These new employment opportunities are not just occurring  in the construction and production phases of development.

The Government has a far reaching strategy for making ^ .   sure that the Australian interest is secured in national .   development, .  .  , ;:V

It was this Government which established the Foreign  Investment Review Board in 1976 to provide advice to  the Government on foreign investment proposals. :

Ã¢ÂÂ   It enforces spardfi'c guidelines, which prorate Â·

participation and partnership in our great resource projects;

Tfie^Government1s objective is to achieve 50% Australian  equity wherever that is possible; and, where possible,  a predominance of Australian managementÃ¢ÂÂ¦

We need to understand that foreign.1nveats^jYh_only takes ,   place when companies comply with Australian laws. v

All foreign investors have to comply with our normal  - taxation policies* .

They have to comply with the environmental legislation of  the states and the Commonwealth.

They have to operate within the“frgmework-of the Trade. Practices Act; and they have to meet the conditions of  the Companies Act. . .  .

~5ust as-all these things apply to all Australian corporations.

On these proper terns, it is in our interest to accept  foreign capital in partnership with Australian enterprises. > '  ^ - ______ '  __ _ _________  Ã¢ÂÂ _ '  Â·'Ã¢ÂÂ  'Â·

The Government also recognises that there is a clear need  to make sure that development has due regard to the -  _ maintenance and enhancement of the Australian environment  in which it is located.

W e have sometimes had to taka difficult decisions to  protect the environment; just ae we have been prepared to  take difficult decisions to secure the health of the  economy,

This has been proven by our actions in relation.-to  — — Fraser island.

r ?

The Government promotes and supports development  -because -Â£-b- bel-iaryÂ©s that the wealth and strength of this  country are of vital importance.

The fifth challenge that confronts us as a nation is the  challenge to assist the underprivileged, those in need;  and the greater the wealth we generate from national  development, the greater will fee our ability to do this.

Governments have no resources of their own. -When people ask things of Government# they sometimes forget  that what we provide has first to be taken from you., and ’

from every other Australian. -  .

Therefore, the more wealth there is in Australia, the more ., =   we can create as a people; the better the services; the better  the education; the more resources there are for excellence  in research? and'1  the greater "is bur capacity to provide .  . Â·

for those who need assistance. Ã¢ÂÂ

One area where assistance is being provided is in equipping  young people with adequate skills to increase their -opportunities for employment. ,  .  V Â· . * Â· .

Many of these job opportunities will require a specialised  form of training ? yet -there are- many -young people in our  community who face the risk of unemployment because they do  not possess the necessary work skills. ; r;

Many of them are products of an education system which for.  too long has placed too much emphasis on academic qualities.

It has ignored the needs of those whose talents lie in - ^

different vocational directions, especially those requiring -: ‘   trade training. ------— ... . r  Â·

It is the responsibility of Australian schools to develop the  qualities and talents of all Australian students; to find  something that each student can do well. ...

I doubt that most of our schools are meeting that standard  at this time. ,

m

To the extent that they are not, I regard the school  system as failing young Australians. ; .  '

As a result# many are inadequately prepared for the  transition from school to work*Â·

The Government accepts a significant obligation to help  train these young Australians; to increase their chances  of competing successfully— for the-gobs that are becoming  available.

Care for the aged is an important concern of the whole  community, aa it is of governments,

-tn si-gri.i.fictmt measures to secure this, the Government has replaced the complex means test for aged people with a fairer and simpler income test, '

Apart from the security offered by the automatic indexation of  pensions, the standard rate of pensions has reached itsÃ¢ÂÂ¢^  highest level in over thirty years as a proportion of  average weekly earnings. *

We have approved the building of over 500 new self-contained  hostel and nursing home projects and have already determined  that this programme will continue for the next three years.

These initiatives have been complemented by our concern for  the family.

We have introduced family allowances designed to help low  income-families. . .

further sums forÂ· capital and recurrent sxpsnditure have-  already been approved by the Government for the next three  years and these will ensure continued expansion—of service's  for disabled people. '

These services include the provisions of training centres  and sheltered workshops for handicapped adults; day  -training centres for"hand!capped children; activity therapy  centres; and residential facilities for people who need

special accommodation to enable them to engage in normal  outside employment, ______ ___ ____

With those facilities, disadvantaged people are able to  demonstrate to themselves and to their own families and  communities that they have skills; and that# with these skills# they_c.an contribute usefully to society and to ~Â£Keir owh_ self-esteem

In taxation reform# we have increased the level at which  a single taxpayer pays income tax from $2,519# --when- we-earoe Â·"  to office, to $4,041# today.

for the taxpayer with a dependent spouse# in 1975-76 income  tax was paid on all income from $4#000# *

Today# there is a tax-free area for this family up to  $6,542.
