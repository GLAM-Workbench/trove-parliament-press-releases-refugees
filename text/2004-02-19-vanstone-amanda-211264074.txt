Labor's Budget Figures Shonky

VPS 037/2004

Stephen Smith's claims today about the costs of offshore processing are wrong. If these are built into Labor's budget  calculations they are shonky and help to explain why Labor always gets itself into trouble managing Australia's economy.

The fact is the introduction of offshore processing has saved Australia hundreds of millions of dollars since 2000-01.

Currently, the real cost of funding Australia's offshore processing capacity is around $45 million per year. Not the $470m as  claimed by Mr Smith.

This is a small price to pay for deterring further boat arrivals.

Before offshore processing commenced in 2001, over 4000 people were arriving unlawfully by boat each year.

If this rate had continued, to the end of December 2003, it would have cost Australia $475m to process these people.

If the numbers had continued to rise, it would have cost millions more.

Even excluding the legal costs, it costs the Australian taxpayers around $50 000 per person to process an unauthorised arrival  onshore.

Labor is misleading the Australian public by conveniently ignoring these costs in order to make shonky Budget claims.

It is becoming clear that Labor can only defend its flawed policy of closing down offshore processing by ignoring the costs of  onshore processing.

Labor needs to be honest with the Australian public and explain how they will pay for the inevitable increase in costs from  their soft policy approach on people smugglers.
