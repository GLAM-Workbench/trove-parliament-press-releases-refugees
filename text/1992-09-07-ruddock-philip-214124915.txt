AT LAST!

The consequence of individuals failing to advance a successful claim for  asylum should not come as a surprise. Deportation is the appropriate and  only result.

It is important that final decisions having been made in a number of cases,  as announced by the Minister over the weekend, removal be swiftly  achieved.

The Opposition's principal concern has not been with the granting of asylum  to those who have proper claims or with the removal from the country of  those who cannot substantiate a claim for protection. Our concern has  always been with the unconscionable delays in processing. Some applicants  have now been in detention for nearly three years awaiting the outcome of  their claims.

Whether individuals who have had their applications rejected will be  deported expeditiously, however, remains to be seen.

Whilst it is encouraging to see the new fastracking system producing some  results, they are not conclusive and still do nothing to address the enormous  backlog of 23,000 claims for asylum still in the system.

The Coalition will be carefully monitoring the progress of the rejected claims  through the appeals system to see if the Minister's tough talk is translated  into action.
