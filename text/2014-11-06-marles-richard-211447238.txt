THE HON RICHARD MARLES MP  SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND BORDER  PROTECTION  MEMBER FOR CORIO



MEDIA RELEASE

SCOTT MORRISON MUST ADDRESS SERIOUS CLAIMS



Immigration Minister Scott Morrison must properly address claims raised by Julian  Burnside QC that asylum seekers were offered relocation to Australia in return for  withdrawing witness statements about the death of Mr Reza Berati.

These allegations are extremely serious and it is important that they are properly  tested. If the allegations are not true, they must be fully refuted.

The Australian people should be completely satisfied that Australian funded facilities  are being operated in a manner that affords asylum seekers dignity and safety.
