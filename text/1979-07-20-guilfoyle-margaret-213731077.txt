NEW SOCIAL SECURITY OFFICE AT BURANDA,  QUEENSLAND

The Department of Social Security has greatly expanded its  service to the people of the southern suburbs of Brisbane with  the establishment of a large and fully decentralised Regional  Office at Buranda. ,

The Minister for Social Security, Senator Margaret Guilfoyle,  announced the office was officially opened today by the  Director-General of her department, Mr P.J. Lanigan, OBE.

The new office, which will have a staff of more than 90, will  deal with all Social Security pensions, benefits and allowances,  and will answer queries about subsidy and welfare programs  administered by the Department.

The population of the area serviced by this office is 152,600,  including about 48,500 people receiving social security  pensions, benefits, or allowances.

Special concerns of the Buranda office will be the large  Aboriginal and migrant populations in the area,  including many  Vietnamese refugees who have settled there.  An Aboriginal  welfare officer and two social workers are among the staff of

the new office.

The Buranda office replaces a similar office at West End, which  was staffed by three people. The number of regional offices  of the Department in Queensland is 22, and recent openings

around Australia have brought the total number in the country  to 138.

Senator Guilfoyle said the Buranda opening is part of the  Department’s program of decentralisation to improve services  to the public.

The telephone number of the office, which is on the 3rd Floor,   Buranda Shopping Centre, at the corner of Ipswich Road and  Cornwall Street,  is (07) 391 6677Â· The postal address is  P.0. Box 201, Woolloongabba,  4102.
