ASSISTANCE FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES IMPACTED BY THE SYRIAN  CRISIS

Today, at the Global Disability Summit in London we are pleased to announce the Australian  Government will provide $16.4 million to address the needs of people with disabilities affected  by the conflict in Syria.

Almost one quarter of Syrian refugees in Jordan and Lebanon experience some type of  disability, many as a direct result of the war.

This funding will assist survivors in Syria and educate communities about the threat of  unexploded ordnance. It also includes targeted support to enable children with disabilities to  participate in public schooling in Lebanon.

It is important that the voices of people with disabilities are heard, and that their needs are  addressed by the organisations responding to the crisis.  Otherwise they face the risk of being  left behind, with insufficient access to humanitarian assistance and essential services, such as  education, healthcare and livelihoods.

This assistance forms part of Australia’s three-year $220 million Syria Crisis Humanitarian and  Resilience Package, first announced as part of the Government’s 2016/17 Budget.

Alongside our humanitarian efforts, Australia continues to advocate for a political solution that  will bring an end to the devastating conflict.
