M e d i a  R e l e a s e    THE HON. WARREN SNOWDON MP Federal Member for Lingiari      30th May 2008  Funding for Local Community Settlement    Member for Lingiari, the Hon. Warren Snowdon MP, today welcomed the Federal Government’s announcement that they would spend over $80,000 in Central Australia over the next financial year on services to assist the integration of refugees and migrants.   A total of 230 projects from 168 organisations are being funded across Australia as part of the $34 million Settlement Grants Program (SGP) to help refugees and migrants become self-reliant, contribute to the Australian economy and acquire the life skills and knowledge to settle in Australia.  “Multicultural Community Services of Central Austral has been allocated $80,344 to assist in their work advising and supporting migrant and refugee families in Central Australia,” said Mr Snowdon.   “They play a valuable role, not only in settling people from multicultural backgrounds into Central Australian communities, but also in promoting community understanding and acceptance of diversity.  “Migrants and refugees will also be assisted in overcoming barriers to accessing private rental housing accommodation which most face without rental history or referees in Australia,” said Mr Snowdon.  “Organisations funded through the SGP such as Multicultural Community Services of Central Australia are to be commended on their contribution to the positive and successful support of migrants and refugees in Australia.”    Media Contact: Kate Sieper (Warren Snowdon)     0488 484 689.
