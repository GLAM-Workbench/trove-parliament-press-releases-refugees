Transcript - Sky News AM Agenda - Monday 17 October 2011  17 October 2011 in Media

KIERAN GILBERT:



Welcome back to the program. This is AM Agenda.  With me now I've

got Liberal MP Jamie Briggs joining me from Adelaide. And from

Melbourne, Labor frontbencher Richard Marles. Gentlemen, good

morning to you. I know you've both been busy over the weekend with

your local regional shows.  You're probably a bit tired but thanks for

showing up. Richard, first to you, the opinion polls. Primary vote up a

bit, Penny Wong wouldn't engage on it too much but that's got to be a bit encouraging?



RICHARD MARLES:



Well I'm probably going to be like Penny Wong and not engage too much either. It's a dangerous road to take

either encouragement or discouragement from polls because if you do that, you know, you stop governing.

We've done some difficult work over the course of this year. We're putting a price on carbon. We're busily

creating jobs; 750,000 since coming to government. That's what we're focused on, not the polls Kieran.



GILBERT:



Jamie, what about yourself? This lead - enormous lead is still there, a lot of political capital. Is it time for Mr

Abbott to start putting forward a more detailed alternative? You've been at him to flesh out his thoughts on

industrial relations for example and we saw Barry O'Farrell yesterday say - come up with a similar sort of

message that he'd be lobbying Mr Abbott to do similar sorts of things.



JAMIE BRIGGS:



Well he has been, I think Tony's been doing a great job in that respect. He's having a debate in the community

and within the party about a range of issues and that's what you'd expect an Opposition leader to do. This

week he's up in the Cape, having a look at the conditions up there with Noel Pearson. It's an issue that we

know Tony's had a great deal of involvement with over many years, including when he was the health minister

and he cares deeply about, as I think you know, all do in the Federal Parliament, about improving the lot for

those who are living in conditions which are unacceptable frankly, particularly in those parts of Australia. So

it - that's - and it's another example of Tony getting out there and engaging and I think that's what we're

seeing is the field evidence. You mentioned about the shows earlier. I was at the Meadows Country Fair

yesterday, a great local event in my electorate. And the voters are sick of a government which lied to them

about a carbon tax they're now forcing through the Parliament and high fiving each other about and they're

sick of a government that lost control of our borders and has no way out. They - message that I got yesterday

was that this was a government that couldn't run a bath. You know, they're hopeless [audio skip] one crisis to

another. When they're back slapping each other in public they're backstabbing each other in private and we

know that now from extensive briefings out of Cabinet on the weekend.



GILBERT:



But Jamie Briggs, as you heard from Penny Wong there accusing Tony Abbott, the Government, and this will

be a similar message, I think we can expect to hear this quite a bit - about asylum seekers and this is that

he's putting the political interest ahead of the national interest. Now given the Opposition has the very similar

policy, both sides agree on offshore processing, it really is Malaysia versus Nauru but both sides agree on the

principal and yet the reality is that we have onshore processing in Australia. Is it time to be a bit more

constructive Jamie Briggs?



BRIGGS:



Well no, we made clear that we didn't accept that the Malaysia arrangement was a good - was good for our

national interest and that's why we were intending to vote against it. We didn't get a change to vote against it

because the Prime Minister pulled out of the vote, after she talked it up, she built up the importance of having

the vote last Thursday. She backed away, she ran away from giving the Parliament an opportunity to express

its view because she knew she was going to lose. Now this whole palaver that somehow we've become -

we've created this issue that the Labor Party's now tried to run, I mean it is, frankly, beyond laughable. It was

at the Labor Party…

Okay, lets - let's…



BRIGGS:



…under Kevin Rudd who changed the law in 2008, not the Liberal Party, the Labor Party.



GILBERT:



All right, let's got to Richard Marles on that. Is this - and this is going to be a difficult one to prosecute

because at the end of the day people do hold the Government accountable and last week the policy looked

dysfunctional Richard Marles.



MARLES:



Well, Australians elected a finely balanced Parliament. We all know that and I think what they expected when

they did that was that people would bring to the Parliament the consistent views that they've held for more

than a decade which in the case of Tony Abbott…



BRIGGS:



[Laughs]…



MARLES:



…and the Opposition was in support of offshore processing. Now what we're seeing is the complete trashing

of that. Its utter rank hypocrisy. In the pursuit of trashing the government's policy, they trash their own policy.

So, they can't reopen Nauru because of the fact that they will - or would - oppose the position we are putting

through the Parliament. This just demonstrates a complete negativity on the part of Tony Abbott and an utter

unwillingness to work with people across the aisle to govern the country which is actually what the Australian

people voted for when they voted for a finely balanced Parliament.



GILBERT:



But where was the compromise…



MARLES:



And Tony Abbott stands to [indistinct]…



GILBERT:



…from the Government? But where was the compromise from the Government on this?



MARLES:



The compromise from the Government was that the amendments we put up to the Migration Act were not

specifically in relation to the Malaysian arrangement or specifically in relation to Nauru. They were a platform

to do either for whatever path the government of the day was to take. Indeed, if the Opposition ever did

become the government of the day they could pursue Nauru. That's the compromise. All we did…



GILBERT:



All right, Jamie…



MARLES:



…was seek to make the law the position it was before the High Court decision but they trashed all of it.



GILBERT:



Jamie Briggs why - okay, well why is - you know, is it fair enough for the Opposition to not at least come

some way towards a compromise? There was no discussion of that nature at all from the Opposition last

week, it was just my way or the high way.



BRIGGS:



No, that's not true, no, no. We put up an amendment to their bill which said that you could have offshore

processing but it had to be at a UNHCR…



GILBERT:



(Inaudible) way, the Opposition's you.



BRIGGS:



…signatory country. No, no, no. No, no, no.



MARLES:



Well that was the case during the [indistinct]…



BRIGGS:



We have had a consistent policy…



MARLES:



Page 2 of 5 Transcript - Sky News AM Agenda - Monday 17 October 20...

6/03/2012 http://www.jamiebriggs.com.au/0esktopmodules/dnnforge%2...

Well that was the case during the Howard years.



BRIGGS:



We've had a consistent policy about this…



MARLES:



UNHCR didn't agree with (inaudible).



BRIGGS:



Well Richard, your platform says onshore processing mate, so let's not get into the virtues of consistency

coming from the Labor Party.



MARLES:



Well our platform says regional solutions. Working it out in the region…



BRIGGS:



No, no, no, it doesn't.



MARLES:



…which is what we're seeking to do.



BRIGGS:



It says onshore processing. Yeah right. Onshore processing, I think mate, is what it actually says and Dougie

Cameron has been very clear in making that point in recent days. We have said for a long time…



MARLES:



You've got to do the accent better Jamie.



BRIGGS:



[Laughs] Dougie Cameron.



GILBERT:



Let's hear Jamie…



BRIGGS:



We have said for a long time - we have said for a long time that we - there are three pillars to our policy

which are that you have offshore processing, Nauru and Manus Island; that you have temporary protection

visas which are an important aspect of the policy and that in certain and very limited circumstances you have

the ability to turn around boats where it's safe - safe to do so. They're the three elements of our policy that we

took to an election. Now the Labor Party doesn't like the idea of taking something to an election and sticking to

it. We know that from the carbon tax but that's what we've stood for for a long time, continue to stand for and

that's what the Australian people will get an offer to vote for at the next election whenever that may be, in the

next couple of weeks or the next month or so. I don't think it's all that far away.



MARLES:



But the thing is Kieran…



GILBERT:



Richard Marles, we received reports…



MARLES:



…if that was their view - if that was their view they should be passing the amendments to the Migration Act

because that provides them with the platform for the policy that Jamie's articulated.



GILBERT:



Well what about…



BRIGGS:



No we don't accept Malaysia. We think Malaysia's a terrible idea.



GILBERT:



What about the broader Labor Party - Richard, what about the broader Labor Party though? There would be

many of your colleagues who would be pleased with this outcome, personally very pleased with the outcome

that it's resulted in onshore processing. Members of the right faction, your colleagues, wouldn't be so pleased,

but tell me, what's your view? Do you think the Government can make this work? We're already hearing

reports that 500 asylum seekers - there's a build up of 500 asylum seekers in Indonesia ready to build boats

to try and - people smugglers trying to you know, get in before the monsoon season kicks in?



MARLES:

6/03/2012 http://www.jamiebriggs.com.au/0esktopmodules/dnnforge%2...

Well, the Government's preferred position would be the Malaysian arrangement. That's really the best

opportunity this country's had to stop the boats from coming and to stop people taking that very risky journey,

and to empower the UNHCR as our effective international agent to determine who are the most needy to

come to this country under our asylum seeker program. That's our preferred position. Now, that's been denied

by the Opposition in the circumstances of denying their own policy. We will pursue onshore processing as

best we can and we will do everything we can to make that work. But we're not hiding the fact that we think

that because the Opposition have done what they have done, that is going to encourage more people to take

that journey.



GILBERT:



Let's look at one last issue - carbon tax. Tony Abbott, Julie Bishop and others urging business increasingly -

in increasingly strong messages not to buy future carbon permits and credits. Is that a responsible course of

action? Surely business has the right to try and minimise their costs under the carbon trading scheme.



BRIGGS:



Well, we've been very clear that we will abolish the carbon tax. I mean - and I think Tony and Julie and other

senior leaders in the party have made that perfectly clear, and Tony made that perfectly clear again last week.

This is an extension of that announcement. We've said we'll abolish the carbon tax; it'll be the first thing that

an incoming government will seek to do, and in that respect, people should make no mistake that's our

intention and they should operate under those assumptions.



GILBERT:



Richard, that is, is it not, a responsible course of action, given Mr Abbott has sworn in blood that he's going to

repeal this thing?



MARLES:



Well, it's stupid conduct, Kieran, and it's bloody minded. They will be condemned by business for walking

down this path. In all the conversations I've had with business - and there have been many - around putting a

price on carbon, they know that a price is going to be put on carbon in Australia and they know that that is

going to happen in countries around the world. And what they've wanted is certainty, so they have the rules of

the game, so that they can invest over a long period of time. What this does is deny businesses that certainty

by making these threats around repealing a carbon price but also encouraging people not to buy permits

consistently with the legislation. That only acts to destabilise, and I think what people want and expect from

their leaders in government…



GILBERT:



They're going to get rid of it anyway…



MARLES:



…be it opposition or government. But I think what people want and expect is that they have stability from their

governments and from their members of Parliament, and the Opposition are offering exactly the opposite.And

I don't think the Opposition are going to go and repeal this. I don't think anyone really believes that come the

next election, the Opposition's going to stand up and take people's tax cuts away…



GILBERT:



Okay.



MARLES:



…take the increase in the pension away.



GILBERT:



All right, Jamie, just quickly, we've got about 30 seconds left.



BRIGGS:



Well, they should. I mean, we've been very clear about it. Now, contrast that with the Labor Party where we've

got an Immigration Minister who's been rolled by his own cabinet, you know, we've now got an Immigration

Minister implementing Greens' policy in Chris Bowen's clothes. You know, Chris Bowen should resign today.

That's the alternative to what we're saying, which is we've been very clear. We've got clear policies when it

comes to border protection, we've got clear policies when it comes to the carbon tax. People will have a

genuine choice and they'll know that we're not going to say one thing before an election and do another

afterwards.



GILBERT:



Okay, Liberal MP Jamie Briggs, Labor Parliamentary Secretary for Foreign Affairs Richard Marles. Gents,

thanks for that. Have a good day.



MARLES:



Thank you very much.



BRIGGS:



Thanks.



GILBERT:
