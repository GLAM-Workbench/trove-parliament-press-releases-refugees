E&OE……………………….……………………………………………………………

TONY ABBOTT:

ItÃ¢ÂÂs good to be here at Queanbeyan Diesel Services. I want to thank Ros and Justin Stewart and their team  for making me so welcome. This is one of the tens of thousands of Australian businesses which is going to  be put under extra pressure as a result of the GovernmentÃ¢ÂÂs toxic tax. The electricity bill here is something  like $12,000 a year. ItÃ¢ÂÂs going up and up and up all the time and that bad situation is going to get worse -  much, much worse - under a carbon tax.

I say to the Prime Minister and I say to every Labor member of parliament if you were serious about looking  after small business, if you were serious about creating jobs, the last thing you would be doing is hitting  these businesses with a carbon tax. As everyone knows, the international economic situation is extremely  fragile. This is the biggest carbon tax in the world. This is the worst possible time to hit our country with the  biggest carbon tax in the world and, again, I say to the Prime Minister: think again, think again.

Now, as I suspect most of you know, the Coalition will be moving a third reading amendment to the carbon  tax later today. We want to give every single member of parliament a chance to keep faith with their  electorates by deferring the introduction of a carbon tax until after the next election because in the end it  should be the people who have the final say on this carbon tax. The people are those who should be giving  their Ã¢ÂÂyesÃ¢ÂÂ or Ã¢ÂÂnoÃ¢ÂÂ at an election to this carbon tax and thatÃ¢ÂÂs what my amendment is designed to ensure.

I say to every Labor member of parliament, voting for my amendment is a chance to keep faith with the  electorate because, letÃ¢ÂÂs face it, it was the Prime Minister who said on behalf of each and every Labor  member of parliament “there will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.”

So, if Labor members of parliament are serious about keeping faith with their electorates they should  support this amendment. We should not have a carbon tax until after the next election.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, if things are so precarious nationally, you know, the dollar is high, iron ore prices are high, why  donÃ¢ÂÂt you support the steel transformation plan? Why canÃ¢ÂÂt the Coalition differentiate between the two?

TONY ABBOTT:

This is compensation for a carbon tax, pure and simple. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs all it is. ItÃ¢ÂÂs not about structural adjustment  for the steel industry itÃ¢ÂÂs just carbon tax compensation. Now, the Government promised a carbon tax but  they promised compensation as well. If they canÃ¢ÂÂt deliver the compensation they shouldnÃ¢ÂÂt proceed with the  carbon tax.

QUESTION:

So youÃ¢ÂÂre happy to stand between the steel workers who youÃ¢ÂÂve been meeting basically on a weekly basis  and the $300 million? YouÃ¢ÂÂre happy to block that?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think that if the Prime Minister canÃ¢ÂÂt deliver on her promise she shouldnÃ¢ÂÂt proceed with her threat. She  threatened them with a carbon tax, she promised them compensation. If she canÃ¢ÂÂt deliver on the promise she  shouldnÃ¢ÂÂt proceed with the threat.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, another matter before the parliament this week will be the vote on the amendments to the  Migration Act. Have you met with Tony Crook and what did you say to him to shore up his support for  opposition to that and if you havenÃ¢ÂÂt met with him what will you say to him?

TONY ABBOTT:

I meet regularly with crossbench members of parliament but I donÃ¢ÂÂt discuss publicly what I talk to them  about.

QUESTION:

Can you explain the logic between seeking those amendments that you want to the Migration Act changes  and the platform that you took to the election and stand by and that is turning back boats to countries that are  not signatories to the UN convention? WhereÃ¢ÂÂs the logic in that?

TONY ABBOTT:

WeÃ¢ÂÂve been absolutely consistent all along. For a decade the Coalition has had a consistent policy, a policy  which I point out did actually stop the boats and there have been three elements to it for a decade: offshore  processing at Nauru, temporary protection visas and turning boats around where itÃ¢ÂÂs safe to do so. So, we  have been absolutely and utterly consistent all along.

QUESTION:

Can you explain the consistency, though, between the two positions? You want an amendment demanding  that non-signatory countries be excluded from this offshore processing and yet youÃ¢ÂÂre willing to send the  boats back to Indonesia which is not a signatory and other countries which are not signatories to the  convention. WhereÃ¢ÂÂs the consistency in that?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, because consistently we have said that where itÃ¢ÂÂs safe to do so the Government should have the option  of turning boats around. If thereÃ¢ÂÂs any inconsistency here itÃ¢ÂÂs the Prime Minister who has been inconsistent  on every single element of border protection. Once she supported temporary protection visas, now she

doesnÃ¢ÂÂt. Once she supported turning boats around, then she didnÃ¢ÂÂt, now she wants a virtual turnaround. Once  she opposed offshore processing as costly, unsustainable and wrong in principle, now she wants it. Of  course, before the election she said that there would be no way, no way at all, that people would be sent to  countries that werenÃ¢ÂÂt signatories to the UN convention and now thatÃ¢ÂÂs the one thing she does want to do.

QUESTION:

You didnÃ¢ÂÂt even try and explain the consistency there you just turned it straight back to the PM. Can you try  and explain the consistency between the two positions for us?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, the consistency is that weÃ¢ÂÂve been saying the same thing for ten years. ItÃ¢ÂÂs impossible to be more  consistent than that because weÃ¢ÂÂve been advocating the same policy for a decade.

QUESTION:

Well, just to clarify on turning the boats back, on the so-called boat phone policy, would you still speak to  the commander of every unauthorised asylum seeker vessel that arrives in Australian waters and would you  still retain the final say on turning the boats around personally?

TONY ABBOTT:

We would operate in accordance with the ordinary rules. Now, there are standard operational rules where the  commanders on the spot make an assessment of the situation and then it goes up the line and we would  operate in accordance with the ordinary rules which have governed these sorts of operations in the past and  they should govern them in the future.

QUESTION:

But would you speak to the commander of every unauthorised vessel that comes into Australian waters?

TONY ABBOTT:

As I understand it, in the end, the minister, the government, would have to authorise a turnaround.

QUESTION:

So you wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt speak personally to them [inaudible] that turnaround?

TONY ABBOTT:

IÃ¢ÂÂm just saying that we would operate in accordance with the rules that have been in place for this kind of  operational procedure in the past.

QUESTION:

Under the Howard Government, the Coalition sent asylum seekers to non-signatory countries, countries that  hadnÃ¢ÂÂt signed the UN convention. You say youÃ¢ÂÂve been consistent for ten years, that doesnÃ¢ÂÂt really seem  consistent with that point that IÃ¢ÂÂve just made there that you sent them to Nauru. They werenÃ¢ÂÂt signatories at  that point.

TONY ABBOTT:

As I said, we have consistently said that we supported offshore processing at Nauru and we practiced  offshore processing at Nauru and that was one of the key elements in the policies that stopped the boats.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, what do you make of Graham PerrettÃ¢ÂÂs threat to quit if Julia Gillard is dumped as Labor leader?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I think itÃ¢ÂÂs fantastic that at least one Labor member of parliament has discovered his conscience, I  think thatÃ¢ÂÂs great. But if Mr Perrett wants to keep faith with his electorate he will say to the Government  Ã¢ÂÂyou canÃ¢ÂÂt go ahead with the carbon tax.Ã¢ÂÂ I mean, there were two commitments that he made to his  electorate. First of all Ã¢ÂÂif you vote for me youÃ¢ÂÂll be electing Julia GillardÃ¢ÂÂ and second Ã¢ÂÂif you vote for me  there wonÃ¢ÂÂt be a carbon taxÃ¢ÂÂ because Julia Gillard said “there will be no carbon tax under the government I  lead.” So, if Graham Perrett wants to keep faith with his electorate - and I think he should keep faith with  his electorate - he would resign if the Government tries to bring in a carbon tax. I call on Graham Perrett to  keep faith with his electorate by supporting my amendment tonight and I call on every single Labor member  of parliament, all 72 of them, to keep faith with the commitments that the Prime Minister made on their  behalf before the election to support my amendment tonight.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, the Prime Minister has to move out of The Lodge for I think 18 months for restoration work. Do  you think itÃ¢ÂÂs time to build a new Lodge? ItÃ¢ÂÂs obviously expensive to upkeep an old building. Do you think  itÃ¢ÂÂs time to build a new Lodge in Canberra?

TONY ABBOTT:

No.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, your deputy has criticised the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister for using the 14 year old  boy in Indonesia to score political points against each other. IsnÃ¢ÂÂt making that criticism scoring political  points against the Government?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, I just think that the professionals should be allowed to get on with their job.

QUESTION:

Are you looking forward to the QueenÃ¢ÂÂs visit?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, I look forward to all significant visits. I, as you know, have a strong position of support for our  existing constitutional arrangements and I think itÃ¢ÂÂs good that the Queen is visiting Australia.

QUESTION:

If the Migration Act changes go down on Thursday should the Prime Minister, or whenever the vote is held,  should the Prime Minister call an election at that point?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, IÃ¢ÂÂve been saying for months now that minority government is an experiment thatÃ¢ÂÂs failed. IÃ¢ÂÂve been  saying for months now that the Government should not try to ram a carbon tax through a parliament that has  no mandate for it. Yes, if the Government is determined to proceed with a carbon tax there should be an  election first. Yes, if the Government is incapable of defending our borders I think the people are entitled to  have a government that can do the job and if this government canÃ¢ÂÂt do the job letÃ¢ÂÂs have a different  government.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, on the 14 year old boy in Bali, would you call him personally or do you think thatÃ¢ÂÂs a job for a  foreign minister?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, as I said, I can appreciate that this is every familyÃ¢ÂÂs worst nightmare but I do think itÃ¢ÂÂs important to let  the professionals - whether it be the lawyers, whether it be the consular service - I think itÃ¢ÂÂs important to let  them get on with their job.

Thank you.
