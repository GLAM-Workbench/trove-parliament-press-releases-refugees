10 DECEMBER 2008

PRESS CONFERENCE , NSW PARLIAMENT , SYDNEY , 10: 00 AM

SUBJECTS: NATIONAL HUMAN RIGHT S CONSULTATION; SHEIK FEIZ MOHAMMAD ; OFFSHORE PROCESSING .

ROBERT MCCLELLAND: Today I have the great honour of announcing a National Human Rights consultati on. It's going to be chaired by Father Frank Brennan, also assisted by Mick Palmer , Mary Kostakidis and Tammy Williams, all distinguished Australians, all bringing a variety of perspectives and I'm sure they will perform an outstanding role in canvassing t he views of the Australian people on those three issues.

What fundamental rights and freedoms do Australians regard as requiring protection?

Secondly, are those fundamental rights and freedoms sufficiently protected, and thirdly, should we be doing someth ing to further promote and protect those fundamental rights and freedoms?

The Government has no pre -conceived views, and indeed, I think it's fair to say that the chair, Father Frank Brennan has no pre -conceived views on the matter. He has indicated that he is very much a fence sitter on some of the important aspects including, in particular, what has been an issue of controversy, and that is whether or not we recommend or shouldn't recommend that consideration of a bill or a charter of rights.

The other members of the c ommittee bring their own skills - obviously each is highly competent. Each will have their own views on varying aspects, but their main role is to engage in a dialogue with the Australian communities. That dialogue, in short, we believe, wi ll not only canvas the views of the Australian community, but will also have a degree of a positive effect in terms of just a dialogue with the Australian

community, as to the significance of fundamental rights and freedom, how they are, I believe, part an d parcel of the fabric of our community, and should we be doing more to enhance, promote and protect those fundamental rights and freedoms. But, I'm

very happy to answer any questions that people might have on the process or the committee.

QUESTION: [Inaud ible question]

ROBERT MCCLELLAND: For that very reason, [indistinct] not only for that very reason, but the fact that he has declared himself as a fence sitter was a most attractive, a most attractive aspect aside from his tremen dous service to our nation.

He has a genuine interest and is a person who genuinely has been promoting throughout his life the fundamental rights of those in the community, particularly Indigenous Australians, but the fact that he has no pre -conceived views, I think he is particular ly significant in his role as chairman.

QUESTION: [Inaudible question].

ROBERT MCCLELLAND: Well again, the Government has no pre -conceived views on it. I should say that the committee itself will be proposing to the Government, various options. They will b e

ATTORNEY-GENERAL  THE HON ROBERT McCLELLAND MP

[indistinct] , in so proposing various options, they will be outlining strengths and weaknesses of those options, but at the end of the day, it's going to be very much up to the Government as to what view we take in terms of the protection of human rights .

Again, I've been at pains to point out that the Government has no pre -conceived views on the outcome that will flow from the process.

QUESTION: [Inaudible question]

ROBERT MCCLELLAND: The issue is of controversy. I mean, just picking up the papers today , the issue as to whether a bill or a charter of rights would shift the focus of political power to the judiciary as opposed to the parliament. This is always an issue of controversy.

I should say in that respect that the

Government has made clear that we would not favour an outcome that resulted in the loss of sovereignty for the parliament to determine these issues of crucial national policy making. But that aside, we've got

ATTORNEY-GENERAL  THE HON ROBERT McCLELLAND MP

Page: 5

very much an open mind as to what the outcome of this process will be.

QUESTIO N: [Inaudible question]

ROBERT MCCLELLAND: I don't want to get into the pros a nd cons of a charter, but there are various models around the world. There are a range of options, I suppose, you could be looking at, you could look at, and the committee will look at, obviously their own range of options, but I would think they will look at the issue of whether there should be a charter or bill of rights. They will look at the issue as to whether we have sufficient scrutiny of our legislation before it is passed by the parliament. It's been suggested, for instance, that one view may well be along the lines of the Treaties Committee of the Federal Parliament that currently looks at provisions of treaties and indeed canvasses the views of Australians as to whether Australia should ratify important treaties before they're adopted by the parliament.

That has been suggested as one option, an enhanced scrutiny of bills process.

ATTORNEY-GENERAL  THE HON ROBERT McCLELLAND MP

Other options include - should there be provisions in the Acts Interpretation Act or some o ther Act that requires courts to have a regard for fundamental rights when they're construing the provisions of legislation or regulations. That's also an issue for debate.

Another issue for debate is whether our anti -discrimination acts are solid - whethe r there is more to be done to unify those. Other issues will be, is enough being done by governments at all levels to engage Australians in the concepts of human rights and just what does this mean in terms of a cohesive society?

These are all important i ssues.

QUESTION: [Inaudible question]

ROBERT MCCLELLAND: Yeah, I might give a long -winded introduction, because it's something I feel strongly about. We're celebrating today, the 60th anniversary of the Universal

Declaration of Human Rights. That was enter ed into by very hard men, so - very few women on the international political stage at

ATTORNEY-GENERAL  THE HON ROBERT McCLELLAND MP

that time . They were very hard men, but as a result of the traumas of World War II they recognised that the absence of respect or human rights was one of the factors that led to the conflagration of two world wars.

These were hard people. These weren't pacifists . These had been men leading countries at war, they knew protecting and promoting human rights was fundamental to world peace. I think those principles , while we d on't confront the challenge of totalitarianism these days, I think the principles underlying the bill of rights is just as important.

In terms of the threat of radical extremism and radicalism, I think the principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights are just as relevant today. All research suggests that one of the most potent antidotes to radicalisation or the development of violent extremism is promotion of religious tolerance and fundamental human rights.

And I think these principles are jus t as relevant to protecting people in this day and age as they were 60 years ago.

In terms of the immediate issue, clearly the issues of development and comments and so forth are a matter for individual agencies and I won't get into the details. But

obvio usly the Government and I think the Australian people, and without judging these comments have been made or not, but certainly I can say that the comments that have been attributed to the individual, both the Government and the Australian people would find offensive and completely contrary to the ideals of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights that we celebrate today some 60 years after it was adopted.

QUESTION: [Indistinct] before any public funds going [indistinct]?

ROBERT MCCLELLAND: I canâ€™t comment on the terms of the details of applications and so forth, but the goal of the Government is to encourage respective religious tolerance and the ideals of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

And we will not be putting any resources into any organisat ions that do other than promote social cohesion.

QUESTION: [Indistinct] human rights [indistinct] in

Australia?

ROBERT MCCLELLAND: I think we are entitled to pride ourselves on the fact that for the best part of 60 years [indistinct] we have been a leading proponent of human rights around the world.

And I thin k fundamentally we pride ourselves on being a country based on the principle of a fair go.

But equally I think there are areas where we could do better. I think the fact that we are seeing just compl etely outrageously unacceptable levels - no level of violence against and children is acceptable. But what we're seeing is outrageous and unacceptable.

We're seeing in our region, again,

unacceptable treatment of women, whether it's education, whether it's social

opportunity, employment opportunities, deaths during childbirth, in the worst case scenarios human trafficking. Much more we can do in our region.

ATTORNEY-GENERAL  THE HON ROBERT McCLELLAND MP

In the area of disabilities there's much more we could be doing. In the area of the treatment and th e living standards of Indigenous Australians, clearly there's much, much more we could have been doing and should be doing. And I think all these issues are issues that legitimately should be part of the dialogue.

QUESTION: A bill or charter, how would you change that situation [indistinct]?

ROBERT MCCLELLAND: Well, again, without getting into the merits of the particular issue, I think the dialogue should be around these things - areas where we can, should and need to do better. Again, a bill or charter ma y be one

recommendation. Equally, a scrutiny of bills process may be another. A range of issues will arise in that discussion but I specifically want to avoid commenting on the pros and cons of any of those options prior to the discussion occurring.

QUESTI ON: What about offshore processing the

[indistinct] critical of what they describe as a [indistinct] on Christmas Island.

ROBERT MCCLELLAND: Chris Evans, who's the Minister for Immigration - giving him a plug - I think he's one of the really solid and unsu ng performers of the Government. I must say that one of the first acts he did as a minister was to dismantle the Pacific Solution.

The Pacific Solution cost about $310 million on the basis that people, including men, women and children, were detained on Manus and Nauru - for an average period of 500 days . It cost in the order of $189,000 per person for the Pacific Solution. That was dismantled by the Government. We have maintained however the excision of islands, and as part of that detention process we have maintained the facilities on Christmas Island, and that detention facility still remains operation al and indeed any person seeking unauthorised entry to Australia from an unauthorised boat arrival will be taken to Christmas Island.

QUESTION: [Indistin ct], you've talked about in the bill

[indistinct] that it's important to obtaining parliamentary oversight [indistinct]. What form should that take?

ROBERT MCCLELLAND: Okay, again, I've got to leave that very much to the committee. I don't want toâ€¦

QUESTIO N: Why is that important, because you talked about it before in the past?

ROBERT MCCLELLAND: The Government's philosophy is that the parliament is democratically elected by the people of Australia to obviously introduce their policies and their programs co nsistent with their electoral platforms and

commitments, and we don't want to see the centre of gravity shift from the

democratically elected parliament to, as competent as they invariably are, to the judiciary , where they don't face that same accountabili ty to the parliament.

Obviously in applying, construing, interpreting legislation they'll have - they've

ATTORNEY-GENERAL  THE HON ROBERT McCLELLAND MP

TRANSCRIPT

Page: 13

have regard to, important provisions. How that's done I'll leave to the committee.

QUESTION: [Inaudible question]

ROBERT MCCLELLAND: Again, these matt ers , as the extent to which the committee believes the judiciary should have a role in the oversight of fundamental human rights and freedoms , is something that they'll obviously consider.
