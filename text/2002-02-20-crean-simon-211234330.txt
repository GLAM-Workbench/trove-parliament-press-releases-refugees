STATEMENT BY THE LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION THE HON SIMON CREAN MP

No private profit from Ministerial office

Labor’s modern Code of Conduct

Former ministers will not be allowed to profit from their Ministerial office under a new Ministerial Code of Conduct, I today foreshadowed in Federal Parliament.

Under chapter 11 of the US Criminal Code, employees of the executive branch are banned from any attempt to lobby government for two years after they leave their job, with a penalty of up to two years in gaol.

In Britain former Ministers are face a two-year ban on taking up employment related to their past roles.

Australia is out of step with the rest of the world and urgently needs a modern code of conduct to prevent former ministers immediately profiting from privileged information they have accessed in Government.

Labor’s code of conduct, full details of which will be announced in the near future, will require Ministers:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ For a twelve month period after ceasing to be a Minister, to not take employment with, nor act as an adviser or consultant to, any company or business interest with which they have had official dealings as Minister in their last twelve months in office; and

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ To not take personal advantage of information to which they have had access as a Minister, where that information is not generally available to the public.

If we are to have a truly modern parliament that the Australian people can trust and respect, we must also modernize and enforce the Ministerial Code of Conduct.

MINISTER OF STATE AMENDMENT BILL 2002

(check against delivery)

Mr Speaker

The Opposition is supporting this Bill.

We consider it to be a mostly non-controversial bill, as it makes appropriations in line with a recommendation of the Remuneration Tribunal.

The Australian people are not opposed to an appropriate salary for members of parliament and ministers.

These salaries are determined by a tribunal independent of the Parliament.

It is not salaries that are causing concern.  It is the indecent haste of certain ex ministers in rushing to lucrative private consultancies in fields of activity directly associated with their government portfolios.

While this has been highlighted recently in the case of Reith, Wooldridge and Fahey, it is not the first time it has happened and it has not always been confined to the Coalition.

It’s time we addressed this issue.

We need a Modernized Parliament

Let me put this is context.

Last week at the election of the Speaker I made proposals to modernize the Parliament, including:

Making the Speaker independent; Making ministers answer questions without notice; Making ministers answer questions on notice promptly; Stopping ministers abusing Question Time for the purposes of announcing policy; and, Making Parliament take more note of petitions.

I proposed these reforms in good faith and offered to talk to the Prime Minister about them.

Discussions have commenced between the Government and Opposition and I am encouraged that we may make progress.

And we need a modernized Code of Conduct

3

But we must go further.

If we are to have a truly modernized parliament that the people can trust and respect, we must also modernize and enforce the Ministerial Code of Conduct.

The current document is not being enforced by the Prime Minister.

There are many examples.

Last year the current Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources, Ian McFarlane, was involved in a GST scam with the Groome Federal Electorate Council of the Liberal Party.  This was exposed by Labor.  The tax office audited the Queensland Liberal Party, confirmed the scam and they were forced to pay more GST.  The Member misled Parliament and did not correct the record at the earliest opportunity. He failed to uphold the standards required of Ministers but he remains a Minister.

And of course now there’s the furore over the Tampa.

The Prime Minister and other Ministers claimed that asylum seekers threw their children overboard.

But we know now that on October 7 there were reports that showed that these claims had no foundation.

The Government knew of these claims but would not tell the truth.

Here’s what the Prime Minister’s Code says:

Ministers must be honest in their dealings and should not intentionally mislead the Parliament or the public.  Any misconception caused inadvertently should be corrected at the earliest opportunity.

It is self evident that this clause has not been enforced.

These examples diminish the public’s confidence and trust in our institutions of Government.

There is a simple solution to this mess.  The Prime Minister must enforce his Ministerial Code of Conduct.

As I said earlier, people want politicians to be adequately paid, but if they are going to receive these salaries they expect them to adhere to a code of conduct.

But the people who are bound by this code have ignored advice, breached the Code and let the public down.

Former Ministers are lining their pockets

4

Since the last election, there have been astonishing revelations about three senior former ministers leaving Parliament to take up lucrative consultancies in industries directly related to their ministerial responsibilities.

In December the former Health Minister, Michael Wooldridge joined the board of Research Australia Limited - a lobby group partly funded by the world’s biggest pharmaceutical companies.

In January he was hired as a part-time consultant to the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, to whom he had given $5 million in taxpayer funds for the building of a new Canberra office the month before the last election was called.

Three weeks ago, the former Minister for Finance, John Fahey, signed on as an adviser to investment bank JP Morgan.  The firm has admitted that he will help secure government deals and provide advice on government relations.

The most breathtaking example of all, though, is that of the now thoroughly discredited former Minister for Defence - Peter Reith - who is now a lobbyist and consultant for Tenix Defence Systems.

We only learnt about Mr Reith’s appointment early this month, but yesterday it was revealed in the Age that Mr Reith’s appointment was confirmed over lunch as far ago as November 27 last year.

That’s ONE DAY after he ceased to be Minister for Defence!

He deserves to enter the Guinness Book of Records for securing the quickest job interview and selection in history.

So it appears that Mr Reith was using the last few days of his tenure as Minister teeing up a highly-paid job in which he could sell his insider knowledge of Australia’s defence system to highest bidder.

One day he’s being briefed on top secret defence issues and protecting the security and financial interests of the public.  And the very next, he’s telling defence firms how they can squeeze every last cent out of the taxpayer, and taking a cut for himself.

And we have seen reports already of him providing access to the Prime Minister’s own office for businessmen from Tenix.

It is disgraceful.

The Ministerial entrance should have a big “For Sale” sign hung over it.

It’s the sort of hypocrisy we’ve come to expect from Mr Reith and this Government - a government that won’t protect the redundancy, sick leave and holiday pay of average Australian families, but which misses no opportunity to line its own pockets.

A Government that denounces unionists and anyone else who disagrees with it, but that misleads whenever it can get away with it.

5

A Government that demands obedience and sacrifice from our armed forces but sets such low standards for itself.

And a Government that weakens regulation and weakens public bodies like the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee and then moves in to exploit the weakness they’ve created.

Mr Speaker, as we’ve discovered over the last week in the kids overboard affair, the Government have lied, spied and denied.  And now they’ve got a ticket to ride.

As the Member for Brand said last week, this isn’t a conservative government; it’s a political gang.

It’s the Consultant’s Coalition.

The fact is, this Government is in it for themselves, not for the average Australian.

They care only about their perks, cars and post-ministerial consultancies, not about better schools and hospitals and a future for the nation.

They’re about creating jobs for themselves, not jobs for Australians and their children.

Labor’s New Standards

Mr Speaker.

If we are going to justify the salary increase contained in this Bill, we have to ensure that the behaviour of former ministers Fahey, Wooldridge and Reith is never repeated.

To do this we have to modernize the Code of Conduct that governs Ministerial behaviour.

Australia has fallen behind the rest of the world in regulating the behaviour of former ministers.

Under chapter 11 of the US Criminal Code, employees of the executive branch are banned from any attempt to lobby government for two years after they leave their job, with a penalty of up to two years in gaol.

In Britain former Ministers are face a two-year ban on taking up employment related to their past roles.

An independent body - the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments - examines appointments and can defer employment and even direct former ministers to stand aside from certain activities of their new employers that involve a potential conflict of interest with their former role.

Mr Speaker, we need to catch up with the rest of the world.

As I outlined recently on the Sunday program, in the near future I will be releasing a new Ministerial Code of Conduct, called Standards of Ministerial Ethics, which, like

6

my proposals to modernize the parliament, I will offer to the Prime Minister in the spirit of bipartisanship.

The Opposition has on a number of occasions, including in our National Platform, committed itself to developing this code.

It has involved professional ethicists and represents the cutting edge in codes of ethical behaviour from politicians.

It will set out the ethical standards that should be required of ministers and senior staff, as well as minimum procedural requirements to give effect to these standards.

The standards recognize the Australian community’s right to scrutinize, rigorously and publicly, the conduct of those elected to office.

The so-called Howard Code of Ministerial Conduct is essentially a list of the conventions and rules that have developed in Australia in relation to ministerial conduct.

The Prime Minister took credit for being the first Prime Minister to set them down in a coherent and accessible form.

Most of the Howard Code is unexceptionable.  But the standards dealing with Ministerial responsibility are out of date.

Initially he applied them to his ministers, but after losing six scalps in his first term, he watered them down and began to refer to them as “a guide, not a death sentence”.

Our Standards will improve on the existing Code in a number of ways:

They will not be not merely a recitation of conventions, but an elaboration of five widely accepted and well-understood ethical standards relevant to public office: integrity, fairness, accountability, responsibility and the public interest.

They will reflect national and international best practice.

And they will be much tougher than the existing Code when it comes to shareholding.

Importantly, our Standards will require that:

Ministers, for a twelve month period after ceasing to be a Minister, not take employment with, nor act as an adviser or consultant to, any company or business interest with which they have had official dealings as Minister in their last twelve months in office.

Ministers will also be required to undertake that, on leaving office, they will not take personal advantage of information to which they have had access as a Minister, where that information is not generally available to the public.

In the case of exceptional circumstances, former Ministers may seek an exemption from the independent Auditor of Parliamentary Allowances and Entitlements,

7

provided they can establish to his or her satisfaction that the activity to be undertaken does not constitute a conflict of interest.

Labor first put forward the proposal to create the office of independent auditor in 1997 in the aftermath of the travel rorts affair.

We continue to believe such an office is needed.

The Auditor, who would be part of the ANAO, would investigate complaints relating to the use of entitlements, inquire into any matter referred by the Minister or Parliament; undertake sample audits of the use of entitlements by members of Parliament and make recommendations for changes to the entitlements system.

We have also proposed that the Auditor provide advice to members of parliament on ethical issues, including conflicts of interest, associated with the use of Parliamentary entitlements.

Advising Ministers, or former Ministers, on post-ministerial employment would be a natural extension of this role.

These are important reforms if we are serious about creating a truly modern Parliament.

And if we are serious about restoring the public’s confidence in Australia’s parliament and government.
