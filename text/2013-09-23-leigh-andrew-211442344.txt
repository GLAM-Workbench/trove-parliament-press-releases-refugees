KEY QUOTES highlighted  ___________________________________________________________



TIM LESTER: Fairfax Newspapers have reported that the whole board of the National  Broadband Network has offered its resignation to new Communications Minister Malcolm  Turnbull. What does that mean for the future of NBN and other issues related to the  broadband network? Our Monday regular is Andrew Leigh - he's in the studio to discuss this  and other stories that are around this morning. Andrew, thank you for your time.

ANDREW LEIGH: Pleasure Tim.

LESTER: How ominous is it that the board of the NBN would say en mass to a new minister;  "we'll fall on our swords"?

LEIGH: Well it does speak to their confidence in the Coalition's NBN policy, doesn't it Tim? I  mean the Coalition's NBN policy is dramatically inferior to Labor's NBN because it offers  fibre to the cabinet down the street, rather than fibre to the home. That means you get  about 25 megabits a second. Maybe a bit better than what some people have now, but  certainly not the transformative technology you have when you get a hundred, a thousand  megabits a second down the fibre cable to your home. That's when a video conference  starts to look like the high definition TV picture that we see in the evening. That, for  example, would make a big difference to Breaking Politics, which would then begin to not  worry about whether people were on-site or off-site. But as your viewers would well know,  they can easily tell when someone's using Skype on the current clunky connections, and it's  not going to be much better under Malcolm Turnbull's NBN.

LESTER: What do you read, though, into the fact that the board would do this with the new  Minister? Is this simply a, perhaps a matter of normal order, that they would say to a new  minister "well, if you want us gone, we'll go"?

LEIGH: You know, I think it is an honourable course of action that they're pursuing, but it's a  course of action they would not take in the circumstances that the Coalition had adopted  Labor's NBN policy. A fibre to the home policy which is, as best I can tell from my door-knocking, supported by everyone I spoke to in the ACT. Can't say that about any other policy  frankly Tim. There's a lot of divergence on policies across the spectrum, but no one I spoke

to said “the real problem with the NBN is they're bringing the fibre cable to my home, rather  than stopping at the cabinet down the street".

LESTER: So does Malcolm Turnbull have to accept these resignations and put in a board that  backs what he is doing, or might he say "no, press on with my plan"?

LEIGH: It's a decision for him, but I hope that he will use their wisdom and experience. I  think the firings of departmental heads last week by Mr Abbott were a mistake, not just  because of the fear that it spread through the public service, but also because Mr Abbott  himself loses the stability of keeping on all the departmental secretaries as Labor did when  we came to office in 2007.

LESTER: Would Ziggy Switkowski make a good new point person for what the Coalition plans  to do with the NBN?

LEIGH: I think it's up to Mr Turnbull who he chooses. What I would urge him to do, though,  is to re-think a policy that is going to build a digital divide through Australia. It's going to see  my own electorate sliced up into patches of fibre to the home and, if you want the fibre to  the home, you have to pay for it. That'll mean that houses on one side of the street have a  value maybe 5000 dollars higher than houses on the other side of the street. People are  understandably frustrated at not being able to get what is increasingly being regarded as a  standard public service.

LESTER: Another of the Coalition's early changes, it looks like, will be an effort to reduce, if  you like, the coverage of the arrival of asylum boats, by saying that they'll do weekly  briefings on what's going on and not announce when asylum boats arrive. How practical is  that?

LEIGH: Well, it's pretty striking isn't it, Tim? We've gone from "stop the boats" to "buy the  boats" to "hide the boats". I think this is ultimately a media management strategy. It was  flagged by Scott Morrison during the election. What it's meant is that when what we  estimate is the eighth asylum seeker boat, arrived since the election yesterday, its arrival  was heralded by locals on Christmas Island. But if he's going to make this work, he has to  gag everyone. He has to gag the administrator of Christmas Island, Jon Stanhope and the  residents of Christmas Island, who were the ones who got the news out today.

LESTER: Is it practical?

LEIGH: I don't think it's practical at all Tim and I think it speaks, really, to the Coalition's  desire to bring secrecy back to government. Remember after we won office, in the wake of  the Cornelia Rau affair, we had to bring in Andrew Metcalfe to do a review of the culture of  secrecy the Coalition had built within the Department of Immigration. They are also looking  at getting rid of the independent review of ASIO assessments for asylum seekers, again  taking us back to the bad old days of excessive secrecy. In other spaces, they are looking at  bringing back gag clauses for charities. It's a worrying trend right across government.

LESTER: But they are also looking, according to one article in The Australian newspaper this  morning at allowing some action against some groups that try and carry out boycotts on  products on environmental grounds like GetUp! or others who might try and lead those  boycotts. What do you think of that action?

LEIGH: It's extraordinary, isn't it Tim, the notion that you would prevent consumers from  getting together to say that they believe for ethical reasons certain products should not be  purchased. This is what we saw during the Apartheid era where consumers got together and  urged a boycott of South African products. We've seen in recently when there were  concerns raised over Sherrin, the football manufacturer; consumers getting together to  encourage better standards. Sherrin responded. The idea that we can't together with our  fellow people and talk about environmental or other ethical issues as they affect product  purchases is frankly is extraordinarily heavy handed.

LESTER: Okay. The last question before we close, the Labor leadership debates that Anthony  Albanese, one of the candidates is talking as about possibly having in the last few weeks of  the process. How do have you have genuine, full-on political debates, without at least some  animosity and some invective, if you like, coming in to play, that there's so far, the two  leadership contenders have been tip toeing around. It's almost a contradiction in terms.

LEIGH: Oh, I don't know. At our best I think we have managed to do Breaking Politics in that  spirit! I certainly remember discussions with Fiona Nash, recently elevated, which were very  congenial.

LESTER: Without arm wrestling from the party leadership though?

LEIGH: But I think, is that the thing you have with these two contenders is, Bill and Anthony  are genuinely two people who like one another, who have worked constructively in the past  and have a great deal to offer the Labor Party. We just can't go wrong in this leadership  contest because they are people of such high calibre with a suite of great ideas to bring to  the parliament. Anthony, with his experience in managing the parliament and his  extraordinary personal story of growing up in very disadvantaged circumstances. Bill, with  what his done with DisabilityCare, with bringing Better Schools together and with his ideas  about building a ‘good society’. This is a great contest and one which is invigorating the  Labor Party branch membership.

LESTER: Andrew Leigh, we're very grateful for you coming in and I should say you've got a  new sparring partner each Monday, Andrew Laming, Liberal MP from Queensland who I  believe you know.

LEIGH: Indeed. Andrew went through the Harvard Kennedy School the year before me.  Because we have somewhat similar names, we're both Andrew L's, I was frequently  mistaken for him when I was there in the early 2000s. We disagree on almost every policy  issue but we've remained good friends even after entering parliament. So, I'm looking  forward to jousting with him when parliament is in session.

LESTER: We appreciate your time today. Thanks Andrew.



LEIGH: Thanks Tim.
