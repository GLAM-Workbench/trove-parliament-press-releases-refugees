E&OE……………………….…………………………………………………………………

ANDREW MOORE:

Mr Abbott, nice to talk to you this morning. How are you going?

TONY ABBOTT:

Not too bad, Andrew. Nice to be with you.

ANDREW MOORE:

Yeah, you too. This carbon tax debate, you don’t have long to debate so you didn’t mince your words  yesterday.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well Andrew, look, I think this is a bad tax based on a lie. I think that this parliament shouldn’t be dealing  with this matter until the whole issue of a carbon tax has gone to the people at an election. The point I’ve  been making since February, Andrew, is that you cannot, you just cannot, as a democratic Prime Minister,  say one thing before an election to win votes and do the complete opposite after the election to stay in power  and that’s what the Prime Minister has done. I mean, she said, notoriously, six days before the election “no  carbon tax under the government I lead” and then of course she did a deal with Senator Brown to have just  that.

ANDREW MOORE:

Well you described it yesterday, as I mentioned, as the longest political suicide note in Australian history  which is already well underway. It’s grossly unpopular with the Australians, every poll you see the majority  of Australians don’t want this carbon tax and apart from anything else don’t see that it’s going to do the  slightest scrap of good to anybody.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, that’s right, because all the effort and all the trouble that we are expected to go to under this tax, all of  the problems with the cost of living and the problems with jobs that we’re going to get under this tax, our  emissions will actually increase from 578 million tonnes now to 621 million tonnes in 2020 and that’s with a  $29 a tonne carbon tax and believe it or not, Andrew, under the Government’s own figures, in 2050 with a  $131 a tonne carbon tax our emissions will actually be 545 million tonnes. So, there won’t be an 80 per cent  reduction in our emissions, there will be a six per cent reduction in our emissions on what they currently are,  a three per cent reduction in emissions on 2000 figures, for what? So, why are we doing all this? That’s the  big question for the Government and frankly it is just another tax, that’s all this is.

ANDREW MOORE:

Well then Tony you get onto jobs and the real fear is - from the business communities right around  Australia and different manufacturing industries - that jobs are going to be lost because of the carbon tax if  they haven’t already been lost and yet, I see the Treasurer, the Deputy Prime Minister Wayne Swan the other  day saying now, this is terrific, the carbon tax, it’s going to be great for job creation. Is he living in a dream  world?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, he is living in a dream world. The overseas experience is that for every green job created through  government subsidy there are two to three existing jobs that are destroyed and this idea that subsidies and  taxes create jobs is just wrong. In the end, it’s a productive economy that creates jobs and what the Treasurer  is saying, what the Prime Minister is saying, effectively, is that workers in the steel industry, the car  industry, the aluminium industry, the cement industry, she’s saying that all those workers are on the wrong  side of history. Now, I think that’s a terrible thing to say to these people because you cannot run a modern  economy without a steel, a car, an aluminium and a cement industry and these are the industries that are  going to be most hard hit by the carbon tax.

ANDREW MOORE:

Now, Malcolm Turnbull didn’t take part in the debate yesterday in parliament and some are thinking well  maybe you’ve held him back because at times his views on this whole thing have been diametrically  opposed to the Coalition. Is he going to be speaking today?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, that is a matter for Malcolm. This debate will go over the next fortnight or so of parliamentary sitting  and Malcolm and indeed everyone else has got plenty of time to make a contribution. Joe Hockey took  himself off the list yesterday because he was going to speak on the Matter of Public Importance debate and  he didn’t want to have to give the same speech twice. I think Malcolm, his view was that he wanted to listen  to some of the speeches, he wanted to read all the legislation before he made his contribution and I think  that’s a perfectly reasonable thing to do.

ANDREW MOORE:

Ultimately Tony, what’s the issue with the debate because it would seem that unless someone crosses the  floor, which, I don’t know how likely that is, it’s going to go through. The Greens are obviously on side with  it in theory anyway. Is this to, again, from the Government’s point of view, to try to convince us that this is  such a great thing and for the Opposition and for you and others to remind us about how stupid it is?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, obviously the debate in parliament is an opportunity for people to put their viewpoint and I think that  is important but one of the very important aspects of parliamentary debate is the consideration of a bill in

detail. That’s where the relevant minister gets to answer questions on the bill clause by clause and from the  point of view of getting legislation which doesn’t have unintended consequences, which doesn’t make a  whole lot of terrible mistakes, the consideration in detail stage is very, very important and under the pattern  which the Government rammed through the parliament yesterday, the consideration in detail phase is only  going to be a few hours and that’s probably the worst aspect of the way this Government is trying to ram  legislation through a parliament, legislation for which it has no mandate whatsoever.

ANDREW MOORE:

A couple of other issues too Tony before you go, the Migration Act and the changes that are being proposed  by Julia Gillard, the Prime Minister and the Federal Government. Now, I expressed surprise earlier in the  week about the pressure you seem to be in sections of the media now to support this. I don’t understand it  because you’ve been so outspoken, like Scott Morrison, about sending people to Malaysia, particularly  unaccompanied minors and I can’t imagine you supporting them going to Malaysia. Where are you at with  all of them?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, we have a clear policy, Andrew and we’ve had a clear policy for years now. Our policy is Nauru,  temporary protection visas and turning boats around where it’s safe to do so. Now, I don’t think that the  Opposition is under any obligation at all to support bad policy from a bad government when there is an  alternative. Now, the Prime Minister is saying you’ve got to support this legislation in the national interest.  Well, we’ve got to support the right legislation in the national interest, not the wrong legislation and this  Malaysia deal is just a bad deal. Now, what I can’t understand, if the Prime Minister thinks this legislation is  so important why doesn’t she say to Senator Bob Brown, her alliance partner in government, “look Bob, you  are obliged to support me on this as part of your deal with me to support the Government”?

ANDREW MOORE:

Yes, well Nauru, some are saying now it’s outdated and can’t work anymore and question whether it would,  you know, without you signing on board of these new amendments to the Migration Act it wouldn’t even be  legal. First of all, the legal advice is that you could send people to Nauru and second, is it outdated? Will it  still work?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, it worked in the past. Now, there’s been a concerted effort by the Government to trash Nauru and I  think that’s very unfair to the people and Government of Nauru.

ANDREW MOORE:

And they haven’t been there like you and Scott Morrison have, either.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, that’s right and, you know, Nauru has gone out of its way to be helpful to Australia over this and it  shouldn’t be trashed by the Australian Government the way it has been, but this is a Prime Minister who has  refused to even try Nauru. She’s had an anywhere-but-Nauru policy because in her stubbornness and pride  she can’t admit that essentially John Howard got it right and that she and Kevin Rudd have totally got it  wrong. As for Malaysia, Andrew, well, we’ve had 1,000 boat people arrive since Malaysia was announced.  We’ve had 400 boat people arrive since Malaysia was signed. Now, what’s plan B from this Prime Minister?  There is no plan B because all she’s got is an agreement from Malaysia to send the first 800. Four hundred  of them are already here.

ANDREW MOORE:

And if I recall Plan A in the first place was the brilliantly thought about East Timor solution which no one  wanted.

TONY ABBOTT:

And this is the trouble, Andrew. I mean, with this Prime Minister it’s been one half-baked, panicky measure  after another. None of them have worked because none of them have been properly thought through. All of  them have been prematurely announced and there is a policy that has been proven to work, it’s our policy. If  the Prime Minister wants our support to implement any or all of that policy well, she’ll have it in spades.

ANDREW MOORE:

Alright, just finally, this media inquiry that the Government has announced to, you know, appease Bob  Brown. What do you make of that?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I think you’re right Andrew. It is another attempt to keep Senator Brown on side. Again, if Senator  Brown is so much a part of this Government why isn’t she saying to Senator Brown “you’ve got to support  this Malaysia legislation”? But as for the inquiry, well, it is an attempt, I think, to bully News Limited and  the point I keep making is the Government’s problems are not a function of its media coverage. The  Government’s problems are a function of its poor performance and this inquiry is clearly a shot across the  bows of News Limited, trying to say to News Limited “look, if you don’t go easy on us we will come down  hard on you” and I really think it’s contemptible that a government should treat a free press this way.

ANDREW MOORE:

Exactly. Alright, Tony Abbott, good to speak with you. Another interesting day ahead today.

TONY ABBOTT:

Thank you so much Andrew.
