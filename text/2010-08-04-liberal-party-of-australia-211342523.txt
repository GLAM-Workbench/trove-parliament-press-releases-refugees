E&OE

TONY ABBOTT:

What’s going to happen now is that we’ll just speak very briefly about the seniors’ policy that you’ve heard earlier, then Bronwyn and I will take questions  about the seniors policy. Then we might pause for a few moments and I have some observations that I want to make at the halfway point of the campaign.

Perhaps though, before I say anything at all, Bronwyn and Peter and I should just acknowledge on behalf of the Opposition the death on active service of  Lieutenant Timothy O’Donnell of the New Zealand Armed Forces who has just been killed in action in Afghanistan. We are an ANZAC family and even  though, as I understand it, he was killed on operations separate from Australian forces, I’m sure all Australians will feel keenly the pang of loss which New  Zealanders would be feeling right now.

As for the announcement that you’ve just heard, I just want to reiterate that I think this is a very important day for seniors. I think that for far too long, seniors  have been somewhat excluded from our economic life. I think it’s high time that we stopped that exclusion and what the Coalition has announced today is not  pious intentions. It’s not just words of encouragement. It’s real incentives to get them back into the workforce. So any questions on seniors’ policy?

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, how much will this policy cost, the costing document you’ve put out doesn’t seem to include the incentives for older people to go back to work?

TONY ABBOTT:

Exactly right, because these are people on a benefit. And if we get them back into work, they’ll be off benefit, they’ll be paying tax and there’ll be no net cost  to government.

QUESTION:

How many people will get a job out of it?

TONY ABBOTT:

But for every one who goes off benefit and into work, there is a gain to our society, a gain to that individual and no net cost to the Commonwealth.

QUESTION:

[inaudible] tens of thousands of workers?

TONY ABBOTT:

I certainly hope that we’re talking about tens of thousands but it’s out there as an incentive payment. We are not forcing people off benefit into work, other  than to the extent that our system already has incentives built into it. I want older people to be economic contributors. I want seniors to be economic  contributors, not just social and cultural contributors.

QUESTION:

Will Mrs Bishop be your Minister for Ageing and Seniors?

TONY ABBOTT:

That’s my intention. That’s my strong intention. Sorry, what did you say?

QUESTION:

I said, will Mrs Bishop be your Minister for Ageing and Seniors?

TONY ABBOTT:

I have a team. It’s a very good team. Senator Concetta Fierravanti-Wells is the Shadow Minister for Aged Care and Bronwyn Bishop is the Shadow Minister  for Seniors. I expect that those arrangements will continue in government.

QUESTION:

[inaudible]?

TONY ABBOTT:

There’s a difference between the services that government provides to people who are no longer able to look after themselves or fully look after themselves  and the role that government has in supporting and promoting active older people and that’s the distinction that I think is very…

QUESTION:

So there will be a Minister for Ageing and Seniors?

TONY ABBOTT:

That’s correct.

QUESTION:

Who will it be?

TONY ABBOTT:

Bronwyn will be the Minister for Ageing and Seniors. Connie will be the Minister for Aged Care.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, do you still believe the retirement age should be lifted to 70 and if you don’t, why should voters trust you considering you’ve changed your mind on  WorkChoices, climate change, paid parental leave?

TONY ABBOTT:

That’s not our policy. I note that the former Government, without talking about it pre-election, sorry the current Government, without talking about it pre-election, raised the retirement age to 2023. The Coalition supported that but I have no policy to change that. The Coalition has no policy to change that. As  far as I’m concerned, it will not be changed.

QUESTION:

Do you personally believe that it’s productive, the way it is at the moment, that people are studying up to 25 and then working and living for another 20 or 30  years?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think this is an issue for our society but as I said, the Coalition has no plans, no policy, no intention to change the aged pension age.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, will you take up Julia Gillard’s challenge of a debate on Monday night?

TONY ABBOTT:

I just want to make it quite clear that it’s very hard to know who we’re dealing with here; whether it’s real Julia or whether it’s the other Julia who apparently  was masquerading around our country for the first couple of weeks of the campaign. First, she doesn’t want debates. Then, she does want debates. First,  she’s not real. Then, she is real. First, she’s being manipulated by the faceless men. Then she’s being herself. The fact is, you just can’t tell when this Prime  Minister is being fair dinkum.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, will you commit a Coalition government to introducing plain packaging on tobacco products?

TONY ABBOTT:

We’ll certainly consider that in government.

QUESTION:

So you’re saying no to a debate on Monday?

TONY ABBOTT:

When the Prime Minister refused repeatedly to adhere to Labor’s former commitment, I planned my campaign and I don’t see why all of that planning should  be changed just because the wheels have fallen off her campaign.

QUESTION:

Are you personally, or anyone in the Liberal Party, behind the latest advertising from tobacco against the Government?

TONY ABBOTT:

The Coalition has absolutely nothing to do with it, absolutely nothing to do with it.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, yesterday you wouldn’t say when a surplus would come into effect under a Coalition government. Your spokesman Andrew Rob says 2013.

TONY ABBOTT:

I think we’re going well away from a seniors policy. I’ve got some observations that I want to make about the campaign. So, if you have any further questions  about the seniors policy, we’ll deal with them, then there’ll be some observations about the campaign.

QUESTION:

[inaudible] how much to you expect to raise with doing that and what impact will that have?

TONY ABBOTT:

What we said was that we would ask the financial management agency to have a look at issuing longer term bonds. These are issued in other countries. A  lot of older people like the opportunity to invest in government bonds. And we’re asking the financial management agency to have a look at it, that’s all.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, seniors will benefit from the changes to the Seniors Health Care [sic] Card indexation. About how many people?

TONY ABBOTT:

Everyone who’s on it obviously will benefit from the indexation and the point I want to stress is that we have no plans, as the Government does, to tighten  eligibility.

QUESTION:

How many people who are not eligible now, do you think, will be eligible under the changes?

TONY ABBOTT:

This is a future issue so it will happen in the future.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, do you think older Australians should be given jobs and prioritised ahead of younger people who are supporting kids at home?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think that everyone ought to be given a fair go in the workplace and we all know that a lot of older people haven’t been given a fair go in the workplace. We  all know that there is in fact serious discrimination against older people in the workforce and I could stand up here and preach about giving older people a fair  go and it wouldn’t make that much difference. I want to provide a concrete benefit to employers who take older people off social security and into productivity  and that’s what this policy is designed to achieve.

QUESTION:

In terms of the payment though, what sort of guarantee is there of, after seven months, the employer just doesn’t sack the oldie and [inaudible]?

TONY ABBOTT:

There are the normal rules governing people who are employed and they would operate to prevent that kind of thing.

QUESTION:

Do have any plans to increase the age pension?

TONY ABBOTT:

You’ve asked me that question before Ashleigh, and I’ve answered it before. No, I don’t.

QUESTION:

Can you explain the savings that you’ll make from welfare payments under this policy?

TONY ABBOTT:

I just want to make the point, I’m making the point that there will be no net cost to government as a result of this policy. There may well be a revenue gain to  government as a result of this policy but I don’t want to claim a revenue gain. I think that would be unfair. I just simply make the point again that every person  who goes off a benefit and into the workforce is benefiting himself and is benefiting the economy and is benefiting the revenue.

QUESTION:

I was actually talking about the age pension payments. A lot of the seniors here want the age pension payments to increase.

TONY ABBOTT:

I see. Sorry Ashleigh, if I misunderstood the question. Look, all of us want to see a better deal for seniors and I reckon that the best things I could do for  seniors is to try to ensure that they don’t get hit with a whole lot of new taxes and we all know that power has gone up 35 per cent over the last three years.  Gas has gone up 26 per cent over the last three years. Water and sewerage has gone up by 29 per cent over the last three years. Health has gone up, I  think, 18 per cent over the last three years and if Labor is re-elected, there will be a carbon tax. There will be increased mining taxes that will flow through to  power prices and if I save the pensioners of Australian from those price rises, I will be doing them all an enormous favour.

QUESTION:

So is that a no to Ashleigh’s question.

TONY ABBOTT:

What I’m saying is that the best thing I can do for pensioners right now is to save them from Labor’s higher tax agenda.

QUESTION:

Why should you be giving bosses money? Aren’t you putting up the white flag, you’re saying that you can’t convince them with an argument alone that they  should employ older Australians?

TONY ABBOTT:

I can tell them that older people are great employees and I’ve been saying that for years. But what really talks is money and if we provide an incentive to  employers, we will see more older Australians in the workforce and off benefit which will be good for them, it will be good for the economy and ultimately it  will be good for government.

QUESTION:

[inaudible] to hire old people? That’s effectively what you’re doing.

TONY ABBOTT:

I don’t accept the supposition that you put to me. It is perfectly economically respectable to offer incentives to employers to take people off welfare. It’s a very  respectable economic position. It’s been done by this Government, it’s been done previous governments. This is a very orthodox thing to do.

QUESTION:

Why just older Australians. Why not younger Australians?

TONY ABBOTT:

It’s important that you target it to people where there is a demonstrated reluctance of employers to employ and that’s why we’ve done it the way we have.

QUESTION:

[inaudible] for all of these older Australians?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think anyone who has spoken to employers recently would know that, yes, there are people who employers would like to employ if they felt they had the  appropriate range of incentives.

QUESTION:

The Government’s trumpeting its economic credentials today, particularly in wake of the no rate rise yesterday and it’s also saying your figures are fudged  and your policy announcements don’t add up. What’s you response to that?

TONY ABBOTT:

If there are no further questions on the seniors, we’ll pause briefly, then we’ll have, I want to make some general observations about the campaign here at its  halfway mark and you can then obviously throw a few questions at me on those subjects. Alright, well we’ll just pause for a second. Thank you.

Nice to be back again. Ok, well, look, I just wanted to escort my distinguished colleagues away from the podium. But, look, ever the gentleman. Ever  courteous to my colleagues. Well, look, ladies and gentlemen this is the halfway mark in the campaign. As you know as far as I am concerned elect the

Coalition and people know what they will get. They will get an end to the waste, they will get the debt repaid, they will get the big new taxes stopped, and  they will get a stop to the boats, that’s what we will do. We will end the waste, we will repay the debt, we will stop the big new taxes, and we will stop the  boats. That is the clear alternative, the action alternative, that I am offering the Australian people.

By contrast the Government has not made a case for its re-election. It can’t make a case for its re-election because it certainly can’t run on its record. As we  all know the record of this Government is record debt, record deficits, record boats and getting rid of an elected Prime Minister in record time. Now as we  also all know six weeks ago the Prime Minister told us that the Government had lost its way. This week she told us that the campaign had lost its way. Why  would you re-elect a Government which has gone from bad to worse ever since the change of Prime Minister? She said she was going to fix the mining tax,  plainly she hasn’t. The ads have started again. She said she was going to fix the boat people problem, plainly she hasn’t and she won’t pick up the phone to  the President of Nauru. She said she was going to fix climate change, well as we know what she’s told us is that the whole matter will be referred off to a  giant focus group, but the Prime Minister has repeatedly said that what she wants is a carbon price and that is code for a carbon tax. We know that if the  Government is re-elected the Greens will have the balance of power in the Senate. The Greens want a carbon tax. The Greens want a higher mining tax. As  sure as night follows day if the Government is re-elected we will have a carbon tax, we will have a higher mining tax and that means more pain for Australian  families. A $40 a tonne tax on carbon means a doubling of electricity prices and that’s the last thing that the Australian people need now.

Then, of course, we’ve got this whole issue of the real Julia who has suddenly emerged, two and a half weeks into the campaign. In fact if the Prime Minister  is to be believed we’ve had three Prime Ministers in the last six weeks. We’ve had Kevin Rudd, we’ve had Julia Gillard, and then we’ve got this thing called  the Real Julia, or as some of you have been calling, frantic Julia, just in the last couple of weeks of the campaign.

Finally, on the Government, let me just say this. The $300 million asset stripping operation against Medibank Private is a sign of things to come. It’s a sign  that not only has state Labor political style come to Canberra, but state Labor economic style has also come to Canberra. We know that one of the reasons  why electricity prices are so high, one of the reasons why gas and water prices have been going up so fast, is because the state Labor Governments have  been raiding their utilities, extracting dividends or what they call dividends from them, but really, these are disguised taxes and the mask is off. We now know  that behind all the smooth talk of the Prime Minister it is the state Labor style come to Canberra.

By contrast, in the course of this campaign what you’ve had from me and my senior colleagues is a strong and credible alternative. Just a week or so before  the campaign started I announced a $1.5 billion mental health package, involving amongst other things an additional 800 acute and sub-acute mental care  beds, which has been widely praised by mental health experts. In the first week of the campaign we had an Education Tax Rebate, which will help recognise  the costs of living pressures faced by families. Education costs have gone up by some 15 per cent from memory just in the last three years, some 50 per  cent in the last five years. This will help them with this cost of living pressure. Early last week I announced that the child care rebate would once more be  indexed. On the weekend I announced a $935 million package to get 3,000 additional high care aged care beds into place and to provide up to 20,000  people with convalescence days as they move from hospital back to home. Yesterday, not only a visionary social change, but an important economic reform,  our paid parental leave policy. I am so proud to be the first Coalition leader to be offering a fair deal for families, a fair deal for women, and a better deal in  the long run for Australian business and today, of course, the seniors’ policy.

What we are on about is real improvement to the daily lives of Australians. That’s what we are on about. I have a highly competent, experienced and united  team. What we’ve had during this campaign, while we are talking about the problems of the Australian people and how they can be fixed, Labor is talking  about itself. As I said, Labor can’t run on its record because its record is so disastrous and it hasn’t made a case for its re-election.

QUESTION:

A few moments ago you referred to the current Government as the ‘former Government.’ Was that a Freudian slip? Halfway through the campaign are you  starting to think you can win this thing?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, I have always said that this election is winnable. But you’ve got to understand I’m not just running against Prime Minister Julia Gillard. I’m running  against all the faceless men who are calling the shots in the Labor campaign. I’m running against an incumbent first term Federal Government. I’m running  against five state Labor Governments and I’m running against the trade union movement which is a $1 billion a year political support operation for Labor  governments. So look and then there’s the history. I’m running against 79 years of history. So look, I regard myself as the underdog, but this election is  certainly winnable.

QUESTION:

Yesterday you couldn’t say when a surplus would be, would happen under a Coalition government. Is that still your view?

TONY ABBOTT:

Perhaps I misunderstood the question yesterday because there were a lot of questions being fired at me yesterday. We will achieve a surplus in 2012-13.  We will achieve a surplus in 2012-13, the same year as the Government is planning. But I tell you what you can count on us. You can’t count on the  Government because what we know from repeated experience with this Government is that all their programmes, just about all their programmes, are  subject to repeated cost blow-outs.

QUESTION:

You didn’t answer my second part of the question yesterday and again you’ve had a whack at the Government today for taking a special dividend from  Medibank Private. The Howard Government did exactly the same thing with Australia Post in 2001, 2002, 2003. What’s different?

TONY ABBOTT:

There’s a world of difference between taking money away from Medibank Private policyholders and taking a dividend from Australia Post. This is a direct  steal from Medibank Private policyholders. It is the equivalent of taking $195 off each Medibank Private policyholder and it’s the kind of sneaky, dishonest  asset stripping that we will see from this Government increasingly if it is re-elected.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, [inaudible] court case in WA where a woman wants to give evidence wearing a full burqa. The defence there wants to reveal that, and a decision

will be handed down today. What’s your view on that?

TONY ABBOTT:

I don’t want to interfere in the operations of our legal system, but I’ve said it before, let me say it again. I find the burqa a particularly confronting form of attire  and I would very much wish that fewer Australians who choose it.

QUESTION:

Julia Gillard’s announcement today, she’s, flexibility on the baby bonus, so the money will be given ahead of the baby being born. Do you support that?

TONY ABBOTT:

I haven’t had a chance to study the details, but the baby bonus was Coalition policy. It was introduced by the former Government. I was extremely supportive  of the baby bonus then, I remain extremely supportive of the baby bonus now. I appreciate that there are significant upfront costs at the time of the baby’s  birth and so I’m pretty well disposed towards the suggestion, towards the announcement that the Prime Minister has made this morning. But I do make the  point that it was originally paid as a lump sum. The Government changed that, now it wants to change it back at least in part to a lump sum payment. As I  said, it’s not something that I would want to oppose. It sounds like something that I would be inclined to support.

QUESTION:

[inaudible] have escaped a rate rise before the election, but the Reserve Bank has signalled that they may go up afterwards. What would you do to make  sure families don’t get hit by more rate rises?

TONY ABBOTT:

The best thing that we can do for families is to get debt and deficit under control. Families and businesses have to live within their means. Government  should live within its means too. When you’ve got the Government out there blowing billions on overpriced school halls, that contributes to inflationary  pressures. When you’ve got the Government borrowing $100,000 every single day, that’s obviously money that’s not available for small business to borrow.  So if we get debt and deficit under control, we would certainly help to take the upward pressure off interest rates.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, you’re party has been very critical of the Government’s decision to inspect just 200,000 homes fitted with insulation under the home insulation  programme, how many homes would a Coalition Government inspect and there are more than one million. How many would you inspect?

TONY ABBOTT:

Alison, I think we’ve been rightly critical of the Government on this issue. The pink batts programme has probably been the most disastrous maladministered  government programme in living memory. There are, I’m afraid, quite a few programmes, particularly under this Government, that haven’t been value for  money but I can’t ever remember a government programme that’s been directly linked to the almost 200 house fires and tragically four deaths that have been  associated with this programme, so we are rightly critical of this programme and frankly the Government ought to be ashamed of the way it’s handled this, it  ought to be ashamed of the fact that it’s never properly apologised to the families of the victims of this programme. I’ll be saying more about how quickly we  want to see rectification of this in coming days.

QUESTION:

Greg Hunt has already agreed to inspect all 1.1 million homes. Do you disagree with that?

TONY ABBOTT:

No, I don’t disagree with that. I’ll have more to say about this in coming days.

QUESTION:

…million dollars, is that going to appear in your election costings?

TONY ABBOTT:

As you’ve probably noticed, we aren’t counting on savings from this programme. We know that the initial spending has been largely wasted and we imagine  that the rest of the money that’s allocated to this programme is almost certainly going to have to be spent on rectification.

QUESTION:

Tony Abbott, there’s a record trade surplus today, something like $3.5 billion, a lot of it from iron ore and coal. Does that prove that the industry can handle  the super profits tax?

TONY ABBOTT:

Far from it. Far from it. The whole point of the opposition to the super profits tax and now to the mineral Resource Rent Tax is that it will damage future  investment, it will damage future jobs, it will damage the economic future of our country. I accept, as everyone does, that our current prosperity to the extent  that it exists is largely based on the success of the mining and resources sector. That’s why it is the very mid summer of madness to clobber this successful  industry with a great big new tax, that even in its revised form, will make Australian mining taxes the highest in the world. The last thing that any sensible  government should do, if there is one single policy decision which completely destroys Labor’s economic credentials, it’s this.

QUESTION:

The National Party in WA are running pretty hard on the [inaudible]. They’ve said they won’t sit in the Coalition Party Room unless there’s a royalties for  regions style scheme offered by yourself. What’s your view on that?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, my expectation is that the Coalition candidates will be returned. That the Liberal Party candidates will be returned in those seats.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott you started off your election campaign full of beans, on day two you did five radio interviews, you did a speech, you did a lunch, you did a press  conference and then you did a street walk. Contrast that to yesterday, where you only did one event, only one event probably today, are you going into a  bubble?

TONY ABBOTT:

I’ve done three radio interviews, I’ve done a breakfast, I’ve done an event that you’ve just observed and when I return to Sydney this evening, I’ll do a dinner,  so it’s been a very hectic day, don’t forget that as well as doing public events, there’s a lot of other work that needs to be done in the course of a campaign.  There are colleagues to be spoken to, there’s policy details to be signed off on, this has been a very busy campaign and I don’t think the pace is going to flag  anytime between now and the 21st of August.

QUESTION:

Do you understand why some women where offended by your remarks yesterday about no meaning no?

TONY ABBOTT:

And the matter was wholly dealt with yesterday.

QUESTION:

On paid parental leave, you keep accusing Labor of increasing taxes but today the Chamber of Commerce has said that your PPL looks like a tax and is a  tax, the Business Council says its policy on the run, Myers says that the 1.5 per cent tax could be spent on creating employment. What’s your message to  big business?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, I’ve been running on this policy since March. I am very proud of this policy. This policy is visionary social change and it’s important economic reform  and I can understand why large business doesn’t like the idea that for twelve months it will have a modest increase in what it pays. I can understand that, but  the fact is, it will not increase prices to consumers. It will not and how do I know it won’t? Because two of Australia’s most significant retailers, Gerry Harvey  said that it won’t and the head of Coles said that it won’t.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, are there any other parts of the tax review that you would consider if you were elected?

TONY ABBOTT:

The handling of the Henry Tax Review was another indicative example of the shambolic way that the Rudd-Gillard Government has operated. Ken Henry  was given a lot of time and a lot of resources to provide the most comprehensive account that he could of tax reform and where it might go in this country.  The Government in effect, has only acted on one recommendation out of 138. Now, there are lots of recommendations that I don’t think a sensible  government would further pursue, but there are many recommendations that do deserve further study. I’ve said it before let me say it again, I think that the  Henry recommendations for lower personal tax are worth further study. I think that the Henry recommendations for better integration of the tax system with  the transfer system are worth further study and I’ll have more to say about this in future days.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, are you ruling out any Liberal Party involvement in attack ads that may be unleashed by the tobacco industry in the final weeks of the campaign.

TONY ABBOTT:

Yes.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott are ruling out any further debates against Julia Gillard, she said that she’ll debate you any time, anywhere. Will you rule it out either for Monday  night or any other night during the campaign?

TONY ABBOTT:

I’m simply making the point that Labor made a commitment to three debates, they failed to honour that commitment when they had the appropriate  opportunity to act honourably. Given the only commitment that they would make was to one debate, I have arranged my campaign accordingly and the last  thing that I want to do is to change my campaign just because the Labor campaign is in trouble and make no mistake, her campaign is in trouble. It is in deep  trouble. I mean, all of this charade of the last few days of “I’m throwing away the minders, I’m going to be myself”. She was told by the minders and the  faceless men to say precisely that. Lesson two in the Hawker Britton playbook is when you are in trouble, because the faceless men have gotten you in  trouble, you say throw away the faceless men, be yourself. I mean she is relentlessly following, the Prime Minister is relentlessly following the Hawker Britton  script, there’s absolutely no doubt about that.

QUESTION:

Forget what Julia Gillard wants, forget what Labor wants, what if the Australian people want another debate, where you can go toe to toe on the issues,  doesn’t their opinion count for something?

TONY ABBOTT:

Of course it does. I gave the Australian people the debate that was allowed to me by the Labor Party. Now, I have set a campaign in place, it involved visits  right around Australia, it involves attempts to meet as many Australians as I reasonably can. It involves a lot of policies and policy announcements and I just  make the point that you can’t take anything that this Prime Minister says seriously. First, she didn’t want debates, no she does. One week she was being  manipulated by the minders, now she says she’s thrown away the minders and she’s being herself. The fact is, this is not a fair dinkum Prime Minister and  you say, you can talk all you like about having debates, I mean, have a debate, who would turn up? Would it be the real Julia, would it be someone else?
