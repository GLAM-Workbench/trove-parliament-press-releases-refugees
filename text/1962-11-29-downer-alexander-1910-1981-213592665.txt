concentration of skilled workers. .  - " Â· Â· .

"This follows my visit to Europe .earlier this year," ;

Mr. Downer said. '

"The new office is in Frankfurt's busiest arcade in the l

Ã¢ÂÂ   centre of the city near the railway station. -

"It will be the base for migrant recruiting and

selection activities over a vast area covering other major German

cities such as Mainz, Wiesbaden, Mannheim, Ludwigshafen,

Nuernberg, Karlsruhe and Saarbrucken. Â·- Â·

"This area is second only to the Ruhr for concentration

of skilled workers and has a population of nearly one and a half

times that of Australia.

"The area has one of Europe's largest motor vehicle

manufacturing plants just outside Frankfurt as well as electrical,

metal, coalmining, steel, textile,  leather, chemical and

shoemaking' industries. Â·  :

Ã¢ÂÂ  i -

"Since the war Australia has welcomed about..10,000

'  West German migrants from the Frankfurt area.

"Until now Australia's migration office has been at the

former refugee camp in Hanau, but with the drying-up of the Â· f  .  ,

flow of refugee migrants and the booming economy in West

Germany it has been essential to open a new migration office in

the heart of Frankfurt."

Mr. Downer said that the new Australian migration office

was opened today by the Australian Ambassador to Germany, Mr. F .J.

Blakeney.

The Burgomaster of Frankfurt, Mr. Werner Bockelmann,' and
