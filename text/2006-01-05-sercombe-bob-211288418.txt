Our drowning neighbours  Speech to launch Our Drowning Neighbours,  Labor’s Policy Discussion Paper on a   Pacific Climate Change Strategy

Parliament House, 5 January 2006

Welcome everyone, and I am particularly pleased to be here with Anthony Albanese, the  Shadow Minister for Environment, Heritage and Water.

I  will  be  addressing  some  of  the  climate  change  issues  our  Pacific  neighbours  are   currently  facing,  and  Anthony  will  be  talking  about  how  all  this  fits  in  with  the  Kyoto   Protocol, and the Asia Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate.

Anthony  and  I  have  been  guided  by  two  key  ideas  as  we’ve  developed  our  Pacific   Climate Change Strategy:  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Firstly,  Australia  must  help  our  Pacific  neighbours  to  meet  the  challenge  of   climate change

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Secondly, Australia must also do its part locally  and  globally  to  combat  climate   change

They’re  common  sense  ideas,  but  unfortunately  they  are  beyond  the  Howard   Government.





The challenge

Our Pacific neighbours are at the frontline of climate change.

They already face rising sea levels, more extreme weather events, collapsing eco-systems  and the contamination of their fresh water and crops with salt water.

For  our  Pacific  neighbours,  climate  change  isn’t  some  threat  to  be  dealt  with  decades   down the track.

Our Pacific neighbours are facing the devastating effects of climate change right now.



Papua  New  Guinean  citizens  on  the  Carteret  Islands  have  just  become  the  world’s  first   climate change refugees.

The  whole  of  Tuvalu,  and  islands  in  Vanuatu,  Kiribati,  the  Marshall  Islands  and  the   Federated States of Micronesia are also expected to be flooded in coming decades.

The President of Kiribati has said:  We are observing changes in the weather pattern, extensive coastal erosion and  frequent storm surges. Islands are disappearing. Our precious, small land area  is  continually  reducing  before  our  very  eyes.  Families  lose  their  homes  and   crops. These signify the very real threat of sea level rises to our survival.



The Prime Minister of Tuvalu has said:  Erosion to coastal areas of our already scarce land is further worsened, and the  increased  salinity  in  underground  water  is  seriously  affecting  not  only   vegetation  and  traditional  food  crops  but  also  the  health  and  lives  of  the   people…The  costs  of  these  effects  to  us  in  Tuvalu  is  enormous.  It  is  almost   unbearable… it is certainly not a question of economics... It is a matter of life  and death.

These  threats  represent  a  considerable  challenge  to  individual  countries,  but  they  also   represent a challenge to regional security.

Climate change has the potential to destroy development gains in these countries.

According to a recent Pentagon report, climate change has the potential to destroy food  systems  and  living  conditions,  and  lead  to  instability,  disruption  and  conflict.

As the President of Kiribati has said:  The  adverse  impact  of  climate  change  and  sea  level  rises  are  critical  security   issues for the global community in this new millennium, and more so for low-lying island states.

This  is  why  climate  change  is  an  issue  for  Australia  for  security  reasons,  not  just   environmental or altruistic reasons.

Successive  Australian  governments  have  been  committed  to  the  security  of  the  Pacific   because it is important for Australia’s security.

This,  after  all,  is  the  reason  for  the  $1  billion  RAMSI  intervention  in  the  Solomon   Islands.

This is why we can’t afford to ignore the effects of climate change in the Pacific.

Australia needs to join the fight against climate change in the Pacific.

John Howard’s approach

Unfortunately, for almost ten long years, John Howard has shown a reckless disregard for  the concerns of our Pacific neighbours.

Mr Howard has embarrassed Australia at many Pacific Island Forum Leaders meetings -  either by not turning up at all, or by ignoring the concerns of our Pacific neighbours when  he did bother to turn up.

In 1997, and subsequent years, John Howard insisted that there should be no reference in  the Forum Leaders’ CommuniquÃÂ© to the need to cut greenhouse gas emissions.

This upset other Pacific leaders. Our Pacific neighbours accused the Howard Government  of being ‘isolationist’ and ‘inward-looking.’

The Howard Government may prefer the ostrich approach to climate change, of keeping  its head stuck in the ground, but our Pacific neighbours don’t have that option.

Labor believes a new and better strategy is needed.

We  need  to  take  a  proactive,  long-term  approach  to  addressing  climate  change  in  the   Pacific.





A long-term strategy

Labor is therefore proposing the development of a Pacific Climate Change Strategy with  our neighbours.

Such  a  Strategy  would  have  a  number  of  parts,  some  of  which  Anthony  will  be   discussing. But let me address two key parts - the need for a Pacific Climate Centre, and  the need for an international coalition to accept climate change refugees.

The  Fijian  Director  of  Meteorology  has  said  that  the  ‘current  Pacific  observing  and   monitoring systems are among the worst in the world.’

We believe a Pacific Climate Centre needs to be established, so that the impact of climate  change on the Pacific can be properly measured and modelled.

The Centre would also serve as an early warning system for extreme weather events.

There  was  an  earthquake  off  Fiji  measuring  7.0  on  the  Richter  scale  earlier  this  week.   Fortunately,  this  earthquake  did  not  create  a  tsunami,  but  it  does  show  we  have  to  be   prepared.



Making  sure  that  we  have  a  proper  Pacific  early  warning  system  obviously  has  direct   benefits to Australia as well.

We  also  believe  Australia  should  start  developing  a  coalition  of  countries  willing  to   accept climate change refugees - and that Australia should do its fair share when the time  comes.

Australia  should  also  assist  with  training  programs,  to  help  those  evacuated  to  adapt  to   new countries.

Australia  should  also  assist  with  measures  to  preserve  the  cultural  heritage  of  those   peoples that lost their homelands.

Australia should also be working at the UN to ensure appropriate recognition of climate  change refugees.

We believe the existing Convention Relating to Refugee Status should recognise climate  change refugees. Alternatively, a new Convention on Climate Change Refugees should be  established.







Helping our drowning neighbours

Unfortunately,  the  Howard  Government  has  only  two  policy  settings  for  the  Pacific  -   hands-off, or heavy-handed. This can’t continue if we want to work effectively with our  neighbours.

When  there  is  no  sense  of  partnership,  Australia’s  influence  is  reduced.   Our  national   interest suffers.

We must show that we appreciate the Pacific’s concerns and that we will help them, in  the same way that we expect them to appreciate our concerns.

As  individuals,  we  would  not  let  our  neighbour  drown.  That’s  not  the  Australian  way.   The Australian way is to help your neighbour.

As a country, we can’t let our neighbours drown either.

In  this  spirit,  it’s  high  time  to  join  our  Pacific  neighbours  in  the  fight  against  climate   change.



Thank you.
