TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW - CHANNEL 10 EVENING NEWS WITH SCOTT  MORRISON

SUBJECT: IMMIGRATION; CARBON PRICE; WALLABIES.

E  & O E - PROOF ONLY



MATT DORAN: Alright, let’s go head-to-head now with our political heavyweights, Finance  Minister Penny Wong in our Adelaide newsroom, and also shadow immigration minister  Scott Morrison, who’s in our Sydney newsroom. Thank you both for your time.

MORRISON: Good to see you.

WONG: Good to be here.

NATARSHA BELLING: Senator Wong, if I can start with you firstly, the explosive leak of  secret Cabinet debate on asylum seeker policy. Many would say that this just highlights  deep disunity and division within Labor’s senior ranks.

WONG: Well Tarsh, I believe Cabinet discussions should be confidential, and I certainly  won’t be commenting on them. From time to time you see things in the papers; you see  things out of the shadow cabinet. You might recall that’s how we first became aware of the  $70 billion black hole Tony Abbott has, that he won’t tell Australians what he’s going to cut  to fill that $70 billion black hole.

But what we do know about this week is that we’ve seen, yet again, Tony Abbott being  prepared to vote with Bob Brown, being prepared to destroy something he believes in - that  is, offshore processing - just to try and damage the Government. This man is a wrecker.

MORRISON: The Cabinet leaks, Matt and Tarsh, I think just show how bad this  Government has got. It’s disintegrating before our eyes. Cabinet leaks on a national  security measure is a disgrace, and I have no doubt the faceless men and women are now  sitting there, behind the closed doors, working out what’s going to happen to the Labor  party, and how this thing is going to play out. But this sort of instability, this sort of division, I  think, is a terrible state for our Government to be in, and I think it’s time. There is no choice  now, we must end the farce, and it’s time for an election.

DORAN: The other big issue, of course - carbon tax. And Mr Morrison, if I might direct this  question at yourself, Mr Abbott has come out and offered, in effect, a pledge in blood to  repeal these laws if he becomes Prime Minister. That would, of course, require a double  dissolution election, and may not be until 2015. The estimate from business is that may  come at a cost of around $1 billion. Is this a law worth bleeding for?

MORRISON: Absolutely. Our pledge on this is unconditional. We will repeal this toxic tax,  and in the forward estimates there’s over $4 billion in excess of costs over money raised  under this carbon tax. So we remain very confident. And we’ll have this tax repealed in  government. And if we are fortunate to form government, and the Labor party is in  opposition, if they want to oppose that, we’ll go to a double dissolution election, if it’s  necessary. But at the end of the day, people should be under no mistake going into this  next election: if you vote for the Coalition, you’ll be voting to abolish Labor’s toxic carbon  tax.

BELLING: Senator Wong?

WONG: Well this is just a bit more over-the-top language from Tony Abbott. Talking about  blood, talking about pledges. He’s also talked about the death of the coal industry, and all of  those things simply aren’t true. What I would say is this: what he’s actually barracking for is  an investment strike. Economic vandalism is what this political leader is barracking for -

MORRISON: That’s what the carbon tax is, Senator.

WONG: The sort of uncertainty that will lead to higher prices, that will lead to an investment  strike is bad for the economy, it’s bad for the country. And Scott, if you’re going to -

MORRISON: I don’t know what you think the carbon tax is going to do, Penny.

WONG: If you’re going to pledge to dismantle it, you’d better tell all these viewers that you  are going to be putting up their taxes, you’re going to be -

MORRISON: You’re putting on a tax, Penny -

WONG: Taking away the pension rise, lower pensions under Tony Abbott.

MORRISON: The world’s biggest carbon tax -

WONG: Lower disability support pension-

MORRISON: And you all congratulated yourselves for it on Wednesday

WONG: Lower aged pension. Because remember, our policy is higher pensions. And  you’re going to take that pension increase away.

MORRISON:You don’t need compensation if you don’t have a tax, Penny, you know that’s  true.

BELLING: Senator Wong -

WONG: You are going to have to tell people lower pensions under Tony Abbott. That’s  what you’re going to have to say.

MORRISON: And you stand for a carbon tax - the world’s biggest. And we’ll repeal it, and  you know we will.

WONG: Action on climate change.

BELLING: Senator Wong and Mr Morrison, can we agree on something? Can we both  going for the Wallabies tonight?

MORRISON: Absolutely.

WONG: Absolutely.

BELLING: Alright we’ll leave it there. Thanks for joining us tonight, much appreciated.
