Transcript  14 August 2012  Interview with Karina Carvalho  ABC News Breakfast



Topics: Houston Expert Panel on Asylum seekers

KARINA CARVALHO:        Well the Home Affairs Minister Jason Clare joins us  now from Canberra.

Good morning. Thanks for your time.

JASON CLARE:                  Good morning, Karina.

KARINA CARVALHO:        I understand you have an update on the boat that's  been missing.

JASON CLARE:                  Yes, I do. There were reports over the last few days  of a boat missing with sixty-seven people on board.  Customs are still investigating this but they hold grave  fears for the safety of the people on the boat.

We've been given a list by people in Australia of some  of the people on the boat. We've checked that against  immigration records here in Australia and  unfortunately they've not found any evidence that  those people have arrived in Australia.

We're checking with Indonesian officials as well but,  unfortunately, at the moment there's no evidence that  those people have arrived in Australia, so sixty-seven

people for whom we hold very grave fears at the  moment.

KARINA CARVALHO:        And that's that boat that went missing on June 28, is  that correct?

JASON CLARE:                  That's right. That's right. This is a boat which, from  information we've received from people in Australia,  we understand may have left Indonesia at the end of  June, early July and there's been no evidence of it  ever since.

KARINA CARVALHO:        Now the government's first step in these twenty-two  recommendations that it's adopted in principle is to  reinstate offshore processing in Nauru and PNG. This  was, of course, a policy that the Coalition brought to  the table.

First, if the government had adopted this some six  weeks ago, this boat that probably wouldn't be  missing now, would it?

JASON CLARE:                  Well today's an important day, Karina. Politicians  have been fighting about this for a long time, not just  over six weeks. We've been fighting about this for  over ten years. Next week is the eleventh anniversary  of the Tampa. Politicians have been fighting about  this for eleven years.

The people of Australia are sick of it and they want us  to get this fixed. We've got legislation that can be  amended in the Parliament today to finally fix this and  stop people risking their life, stop people dying at sea.  We've seen too much evidence of that over the past  few months.

KARINA CARVALHO:        So what does this mean for the people-swap deal  with Malaysia? If you don't get the assurances from  Malaysia will you dump the Malaysia solution?

JASON CLARE:                  Well what Angus Houston said was that that's a vital  part of stopping people risking their lives in coming by  boat but more work needs to be done on providing  safeguards, in particular for young people who are  unaccompanied.

Chris Bowen and the Prime Minister yesterday said  that more work will now be done with Malaysia on that  front. The first step is to introduce regional processing

in Nauru and to introduce regional processing at  Manus Island.

We'll also do more work with the Malaysian  Government based on the advice of Angus Houston  and the expert panel that that's an important part of  stopping people from risking their lives and coming to  Australia by boat.

KARINA CARVALHO:        Paris Aristotle on Lateline last night was keen to  emphasise that offshore processing doesn't  necessarily mean that people will be housed in  detention centres. So how will they be housed on  Nauru and on PNG?

JASON CLARE:                  Well there'll be housing made available in both  locations for individuals but they're not in a detention  facility. They'll be allowed to move freely in those  locations. So it's not a detention facility like you would  see at Christmas Island or you would see at Darwin or  Scherger or any of the detention facilities in Australia.  It's an open facility where accommodation is provided  as well as educational and training facilities and so  forth.

KARINA CARVALHO:        So how soon will Nauru and PNG be up and  running?

JASON CLARE:                  Well as quick as possible. The sooner we're able to  implement this, the sooner we can stop people risking  their lives and coming to Australia by boat. If we can  pass legislation through the Parliament this week, we  can take action with the support of Australian  authorities to set up facilities in Nauru and in Manus  as quickly as possible. That's the challenge. That's  one that we need to meet.

KARINA CARVALHO:        And does the Government have the resources to do  the oversight and the monitoring that Paris Aristotle  was talking about that makes this different to what  happened previously under the Howard Government?

JASON CLARE:                  I saw Paris's interview on Lateline last night. He  made the point that an important part of this has to be  independent oversight. In addition to what you saw  under the Howard Government, you need  independent oversight.

Paris also made the point and included it in the report  that you also need to increase the number of refugees  that Australia takes. So under this plan we would  double the number of refugees that we take as part of  the humanitarian program and that's an important part  of encouraging people not to get on a boat and not  risk their lives by trying to come to Australia in such a  risky way.

KARINA CARVALHO:        But who will the onus be on to maintain asylum  seekers' wellbeing while their claims are being  processed? And not just while their claims are being  processed, while they're housed on PNG and Nauru  because they will have to wait there even once their  processing has taken place, won't they, because  there's effectively they need to stay the length of time  that they would if they'd applied in their home country.

JASON CLARE:                  That's right, Karina. A key principle in the report that  Angus Houston handed down yesterday was what he  called the no-advantage test, so that anybody that  chooses to come to Australia by boat won't have an  advantage over somebody who tries to come to  Australia through a process through a camp in Africa  or through the process using the UN in Indonesia.

So there's no advantage in going one way or the  other. The disadvantage is if you come to Australia by  boat you're paying a people smuggler ten thousand  dollars and you're risking your life.

In answer to your first part of your question, the  Australian Government will have the principal role.  They're supported by the UNHCR as well as the IOM.

KARINA CARVALHO:        And Angus Houston says the cost of adopting all  these recommendations will be about a billion dollars  a year. What impact is that likely to have on the  Federal budget?

JASON CLARE:                  Well the cost of doing nothing is a lot more. The cost  of doing nothing is that more people die. We've seen  more than three hundred people die in the last seven  months. Australian people have seen this on their TV  screen all too often and they're screaming at their  television sets. They're saying just fix it. The  Australian Parliament, fingers crossed, will do just that  today.

KARINA CARVALHO:        Jason Clare in Canberra, thanks for your time.

JASON CLARE:                  Thanks Karina.
