E&EO…………………………………………………………………………………………..

LEON BYNER:

Peter Dutton good morning.

PETER DUTTON:

Good morning Leon. Good to be with you.

LEON BYNER:

Now this issue that you referred to that’s had a lot of people criticise you; what was  the purpose in raising this? And in doing so, what is it you’d like to do?

PETER DUTTON:

Well Leon I was asked a question about the Sudanese gang violence, the Apex  gangs running riot in Melbourne at the moment and the simple point that I made is  that we sometimes allow the minority within a particular ethnic group to define the  vast majority of good people within that ethnic group. It is well acknowledged and  historical fact that there were difficulties in bringing people out under the Lebanese  concession and we had difficulties in parts of the country that it seems can’t be  spoken about.

As you point out before, the Greens were calling me a racist and bigot on Tuesday  and then saying no no what he is saying is accurate and acceptable, but we just  can’t talk about it - this is what they were saying yesterday.

So I think we need to be honest. We can’t allow good people to be defined by the  bad people within that community and we also need to learn from the mistakes of  history. We are bringing in some wonderful people from Syria now and I want to  bring in the right people, people who are in most need of protection, the people that  are facing persecution in a war-torn country and I want those people to work when

they get here, I want them to be provided with assistance, I want them to educate  their children, I want them to allow their family members, including girls and adults  within that family group to go and learn English language lessons, I want them to  play sport, to be part of a great Australian society and I want them to have the new  life that they seek. I think that’s what all Australians want. We want people to come  here, not to do us harm, not to bring their troubles with them, to bring their problems  with them, but to take the opportunity given to them in moving into a country like  Australia. And that’s what the great majority, the vast majority of migrants do when  they come to our country.

I was criticised by Labor when we said we were going to have additional security  checks on bringing the 12,000 Syrians in. They said no, you’re dragging your feet,  they should be here now, you should have brought them sooner; well as it turns out  we’ve identified 22 people within the applicants that we do have security concerns  about. We don’t want to disrupt the Australian way of life. We don’t want people to  come here and cause us harm and that’s why we have to do the right thing by the  migrants that have moved here already, by the Australians that want a safe society. I  am not going to cower from that. I am not going to step back and the tragic part of  the debate this week has been that Bill Shorten has tried to turn this into a political  opportunity by mangling and misrepresenting my words and he’s done it for a cheap  political attack.

He’s tried to upset the Lebanese community and to cause anger by misrepresenting  my words, but the trouble is for Bill Shorten is that he’s been found out. In fact in the  last two Question Times in Parliament on Thursday and Wednesday, he didn’t ask a  single question of either the Prime Minister or myself on this topic because he knows  that he went too far, that he got found out and I think Australians want an honest  debate. They don’t want this phoney elite sort of tricky language that Mr Shorten  wants to use.

People want to talk honestly about these matters and if we don’t we won’t learn from  the mistakes that we have made and I think it’s incumbent upon all of us to do the  right thing in having the proper screening, the proper planning for bringing migrants  into this country. If we do that, we’ll continue to grow this great country.

LEON BYNER:

I need to clarify something here. So are you really saying that, alright, you’re beefing  up security, but then again every country is doing that so that’s not necessarily  unusual. Is it because that you’ve named a particular group of individuals that are  going to be checked and double checked, is that regarded as racist or politically  incorrect? Is that the problem or in fact are you signalling that there is going to be a  modification of the way we look at immigration?

PETER DUTTON:

In terms of the people that we are bringing in through the refugee and humanitarian  programme there are two reasons we want to conduct security checks. One is that  we don’t want to bring people that are going to cause harm - and we’re seeing in  Belgium, in Paris and in other movements of people around the world now that we

do have people that want to commit terrorist acts and we do have people that aren’t  going to these countries for the right reasons - that’s the first reason. The second  reason is that I don’t want to displace somebody, a refugee, who is facing genuine  persecution, whose family might be under imminent attack, I don’t want to displace  that person from the queue with somebody who is not a legitimate refugee. I think  this is the basics of getting the migration programme right.

But what has happened this week is that Mr Shorten sought to turn this into political  advantage for himself, but there is not one word that I have used or quoted  [inaudible] that he has quoted to back up the outrageous claims that he has made.

Now I just think people have seen through that now and I honestly believe that  Australians want an honest debate and if we have problems within our community  we need to talk about it, work it out and have an honest discussion about it otherwise  people I think just tune out and frankly I think it’s one of the problems that we have in  the modern day political discourse and public debate and I think it is very  unfortunate.

LEON BYNER:

Stay on the line, somebody you know well, the Federal Member for Deakin Michael  Sukkar. Michael thanks for joining us today. You agree with Peter Dutton, tell us  why?

MICHAEL SUKKAR:

Good to be on Leon. I agree with Peter because he was basically using facts that  nobody has disagreed with and the facts are that one particular cohort, Lebanese  Muslims, are drastically over represented in terrorism related offences. Now that’s  not a particularly easy fact to point out. For some people it is quite inconvenient. For  the Greens they think even though it is a fact we shouldn’t say it, we should sweep it  under the rug, but I think it is refreshing and I think the Australian public sees or finds  it refreshing that a Minister, in prosecuting a very difficult portfolio, is willing to say  things that are difficult but true.

Now the corollary for the point that the Minister made - and he did make this very  clearly - is that the vast majority of Lebanese Muslims, indeed the vast majority of  Lebanese Australians are wonderful citizens, but at the same time we have to find  ways of explaining and understanding why 22 of the last 33 people charged with  terrorism related offences were from one ethnic background. And if we don’t learn  that lesson, as Bill Shorten seems not to want to learn, then the risk is that a future  government - probably a future Labor government - decides to revert back to the  Fraser era policies which was basically a family reunion based immigration  programme rather than a skills based immigration programme. That’s the risk for our  country.

I think the great success we’ve had over the last 25 years is the fact that we do have  the most rigorous screening and vetting processes for migrants and we have reaped  the benefits of that and I say this Leon as a proud person with Lebanese heritage.

So I absolutely endorse Peter’s comments. I think it’s refreshing to see and the really  scary thing here is that the alternative prime minister of this country would so crudely  and in such a nasty way try to ferment discord in the community. I think that’s really  scary and I think it says a lot about his trickiness and his sneakiness.

LEON BYNER:

Alright Michael Sukkar, thank you. Now Peter Dutton, I’ve got a couple of other  questions. Pauline Hanson, if she got her way, would have you ban the burka. Has  that even been considered?

PETER DUTTON:

No it hasn’t Leon. We want to work with communities. I mean it’s very important that  we work with communities. There will be cultural differences. I don’t want to see any  religious dress banned. I don’t want to see that outcome - that’s my honest reaction.

The Governments concern is to make sure - certainly from my perspective as  Immigration Minister - firstly; that we keep our borders secure which we’ve done. I  mean we have stopped boats, we’ve got kids out of detention, we’ve restored  integrity to the programme and I want Australians to have confidence in our  migration programme and we can only do that, if we have these frank discussions,  call out problems where they exist and celebrate the great success that Michael  Sukkar talked about before and in fact is a living example of migrant parents who  have come here, taken the opportunity, educated their children and their family  makes a great contribution to our country - that is the majority story and I don’t want  it to be defined by other issues.

I want us to be able to provide a new life to people. We’ve done that for 850-odd  thousand people since the Second World War and this country is great today  because of the diversity that we have and all of that which many, many cultures have  bought to our county and we celebrate that, but I am going to call out the people who  are doing the wrong thing. The people who are going off as foreign fighters and if we  have a particular concentration within a community - and I have pointed it out in this  regard as Michael reminded you before in the Lebanese Muslim community - we  need to call it out. We need to be honest about it and frankly most of the leaders  within the community want that same frankness because they don’t want to be  defined, they don’t want to be besmirched, they don’t want the vast majority of good  people to be besmirched by this small element.

At the moment it seems to me that you can’t have conversations in this country, even  if it’s factually correct and that is not a position that I will accept in a country like  Australia where we value free speech. People can agree with me or disagree  vehemently against me, but I’m not going to be silenced and particularly when we  are arguing factual recall of history - that’s the reality of what we face and we are  going to deal with it.

LEON BYNER:

Four five seven visas, there are some issues and some serious ones. Joanna Howe  wrote a fantastic paper on it and I know you have read it and I know the Government  wants to make some changes. What will happen and when?

PETER DUTTON:

So a couple of things have already happened. Firstly to point out that the number of  457 visas has actually dropped. We have created about 500,000 jobs since we came  to Government, but there are 13,000 less 457 holders today - in fact the number  peaked when Bill Shorten was the Employment Minister. So there are a number of  factors.

We need to work with communities, particularly regional communities, where they  are finding it hard to get workers and they have to properly engage to try and employ  Australian workers. The whole idea of the programme is that there’s an obligation on  employers to do their best to employ an Australian. If they can’t then we don’t want  their businesses just to close. We don’t want them to put off the other staff because  they can’t keep the doors open. They can employ somebody with the appropriate  skills at the minimum wage with the same conditions that are provided for under the  457 visa programme.

But we do think it needs tightening. For example, under Labor’s list or the categories  of occupation, they had for example goat herder - there were 650 different  categories - now I have asked for that to be reviewed and that work will come back  shortly and I think needs to be tightened.

One of the things that happened during the Gillard years was that after somebody  had finished work under a 457 visa they were allowed to continue to work for…they  pushed it from 28 days out to 90. I’ve reduced that back to 60 and so some of the  contributions that Dr Howe’s made we agree with strongly.

We want to employ Australians first and if the job is not able to be filled by an  Australian then, as I say, we don’t want that business to suffer and we don’t want the  other employees within that business to suffer.

So that’s the whole basis, the whole genesis and being for the 457 programme. I  hope it continues, but I do want to tighten it up and I think there would be broad  community support for that.

LEON BYNER:

I know there is a proposal by the Xenophon team and I believe the Treasurer said  we’ll do it if it gets passed and that is that if you do work on the harvest trail, which is  pretty much from right now, you will still be able to keep your unemployment  benefits.

PETER DUTTON:

Well look, I haven’t seen all of the detail of what the Treasurer has said Leon. I mean  there is an issue obviously in relation to the Backpackers Tax, which is a separate  issue to the 457 issue, but the reality that we are dealing with in this space is that we  are competing with international competitors and the proposal that the Treasurer’s  put forward, I think keeps us internationally competitive, but it also [inaudible] confer  an advantage on the overseas workers, over the Australian worker and this is the  crazy irony of Labor joining up with Jacqui Lambie on this because the proposal is to  confer a tax advantage on foreign workers over Australian workers that would go out  and do this work of picking fruit etc… and again I think that that is a strange position  for the Labor Party to adopt. It’s obviously an opportunistic one because they think  that they can just frustrate us in the Senate.

But I think there will be agreement with the crossbench Senators on the sensible  measure that the Treasurer has put forward. If we can do that we help the farmers  because at the moment the thought of food rotting on vines or on trees is a terrible  thing because it takes away from the profitability from those farms, but it takes away  from the productivity of our economy and that’s the last thing that we want.

LEON BYNER:

Peter thank you for joining us.

PETER DUTTON:

Thanks Leon. Really appreciate it mate.

Thank you.
