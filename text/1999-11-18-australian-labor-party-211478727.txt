Ruddock’s unaccompanied luggage lands at 
Christmas Island

Â

“Immigration Minister Philip Ruddock has barely unpacked from his 
return trip to China, which he hailed as  a screaming success 
in plugging the hole and stop the stream of boat people arriving front 
China, to be greeted by a boat carrying 60 Chinese illegals at Christmas 
Island,” Shadow Justice and Customs Minister, Duncan Kerr, said today.

Â

But this is no laughing matter. No amount of denial 
or rhetoric from Ministers Ruddock and Vanstone will convince the community 
that our coastal security is being managed adequately.

Â

“The Opposition again renews its call on the Government 
to bite the bullet on coastal surveillance and examine establishing 
a single integrated, well resourced and effective coastguard to take 
charge of maritime security and law enforcement.

Â

“The message of Australia being a soft target must 
play a role in the recent influx of large numbers of illegals from China 
and the Middle-East. An effective coastguard better able to detect and 
apprehend boats early will help turn this message around,” Mr Kerr 
said.
