E&OE……………………….…………………………………………………………………

MICHAEL SMITH:

Happy New Year, Tony.

TONY ABBOTT:

And to you too, Michael and welcome to Sydney.

MICHAEL SMITH:

Thank you, it’s great to be back. As one old Marist Brothers boy to a St Aloysius, you went  to St Aloysius for primary school, didn’t you?

TONY ABBOTT:

I went to Aloy’s and then I went to St Ignatius’.

MICHAEL SMITH:

And look I just have to disclose this. My aunt Lizzie, my aunt Elizabeth, was a teacher at St  Aloysius and she often talks about that naughty Joseph Hockey and that naughty Anthony  Abbott.

TONY ABBOTT:

Oh look, I’m sure Joe was model student.

MICHAEL SMITH:

You clocked him once, didn’t you flatten him?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, it takes a lot to flatten Joe and I never claimed to have flattened him.

MICHAEL SMITH:

But you clocked him?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, what goes on tour stays on tour.

MICHAEL SMITH:

Good on you, Tony Abbott. Now, where are you going to build dams?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I think the important thing is that we get over the dam phobia that we’ve had for the  last couple of decades. The sorts of sites that might be suitable for dams will be the sort of  thing that this high level shadow ministerial taskgroup will be looking at. But the point I want  to make today is that in the floods that we’ve got at the moment you’ve got something like  two times the volume of Sydney Harbour of freshwater going through Rockhampton and it’s  important to at least look at harnessing this water because we are a continent which needs to  better manage our water. We don’t have a lack of water so much as a lack of water  management and that’s why I think we need to consider, strongly consider how dams can be  a part of our future.

MICHAEL SMITH:

So really the essence of your announcement today is to say that your party is not dam phobic.  You’re not opposed to dams per se.

TONY ABBOTT:

Absolutely right and the problem is that we haven’t had a significant dam built in Australia  for about two decades. We’ve had a few small dams put in, we’ve had a couple of dams  extended but we haven’t had a big new dam since, I think, the Burdekin dam was put in back  in the mid 1980s.

Now, these disastrous floods should be a timely opportunity to consider that dams aren’t just  water storages, they’re flood mitigation devices, they offer the potential for emission-free  power generation and they offer the potential to procure environmental flows in dry periods  as well as the kind of food security that we like to think of more often and I just think that it’s  high time that we got over this dam phobia that we’ve suffered from for two decades or more,  thanks largely to the Green moment.

MICHAEL SMITH:

Why didn’t you do it when you were in power?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well look, that’s a fair question, Mike, and I think it’s important that we’re not prisoners of  the past. I mean, nothing would ever change if we…

MICHAEL SMITH:

No, but it’s a genuine question, Tony, it’s a genuine question.  So, I’m not sort of revisiting  the past, I just want to know why, was there a reason? Were you, you know, no money or  what was it? Why didn’t you do it?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, you might remember that Malcolm Turnbull to his credit did start to investigate the  possibility of the new dams in our last year. So, we weren’t averse to the idea. I think the  other problem was that…

MICHAEL SMITH:

Still not an answer though, Tony, like, not being averse to it, that’s fair enough but why  didn’t you? There was no idea or no money, why didn’t it happen?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think there was a tendency to think that, you know, there was no point building dams  because it was never going to rain again and they would never fill up. What we now know is  that it can rain and will rain and the important thing is to ensure that if and when it happens  we’re ready a) to mitigate the severity of the floods and b) to make better use of all this water  than we have in the recent past.

MICHAEL SMITH:

A young journalist at this press conference on the NBN today, not one of ours, asked a great  question of the CEO of the NBN business and it was very simple. The journalist said, how  much fraud, given that, you know, this Alcatel company was involved in bribes and fraud,  how much fraud would be acceptable at the NBN? Let’s just hear a little of that grab.

** EXERPT FROM NBN PRESS CONFERENCE**

MICHAEL SMITH:

It was a very interesting thing. He’d take full responsibility now at the NBN Co. Fraud  happened in his last job because of lax management and the bloke says, ‘oh no, no but I  wasn’t responsible for that’. It just strikes me as most peculiar that no questions are asked,

Tony Abbott, about, you know, I think they are quite legitimate questions about the way  Alcatel was run and the bloke who was running that is now running the NBN company.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I think they are perfectly reasonable questions, Mike, and look, I think the Government  a has a lot of explaining to do because they have appointed at least two former Alcatel senior  managers to run the NBN and did they know anything about the problems at Alcatel when  they appointed them? More pertinently, how can the Government be confident that the same  lax management culture which existed under these guys at Alcatel won’t come to the NBN?  Now, you know, the NBN involves $50 billion plus of taxpayers’ money. We have a  Government with a terrible history of squandering taxpayers’ money and how can we be  confident that this won’t happen again?

MICHAEL SMITH:

There’s been announcements today. As I understand it, the Federal Government probably had  very little choice other than to change the way it processed asylum seekers because of this  finding of the High Court. What’s your take on it?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, the only way to sort this problem is to stop the boats. Now, I mean, I read the  Government press release and it just looks to me like a whole lot of bureaucratic hang-wringing and fiddling. I mean, I think they’ve renamed the process. Well, wacky doo. I mean,  this isn’t going to stop the boats, it’s not going to deter the people smugglers and the problem  will just continue. Now, it’s not easy to stop the boats but the former Howard Government  had the guts to put the policies in place that worked and the current Government wasn’t  magnanimous enough to accept that the Howard Government got some things right. They  changed the policies and the boats started coming again and that’s the tragedy. It’s a tragedy  for, obviously, many asylum seekers who have lost their lives in some cases and it’s bad for  our country because we’ve lost control of our borders.

MICHAEL SMITH:

Tony, it’s good to talk with you. Don’t be a stranger to this programme, will you?

TONY ABBOTT:

I will not be, Michael.

MICHAEL SMITH:

Right-o, all the best.
