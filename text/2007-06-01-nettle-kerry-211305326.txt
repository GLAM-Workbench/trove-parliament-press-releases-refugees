Howard heartless on HIV refugees

1st Jun 07

Greens Senator Kerry Nettle today rejected the Prime Minister's  view that refugees with HIV or other serious diseases should not be  allowed into Australia.

"The Prime Minister's heartless approach to refugees is taken to  new depths by his announcement today that he wants to reject  refugees who are unfortunate enough to be suffering from disease

as well as persecution," Senator Nettle said.

"Australia has a responsibility to accept refugees who are fleeing  persecution. The fact that some may be suffering from disease does  not change that responsibility.

"The HIV epidemic in Africa means that a blanket ban on accepting  HIV positive refugees will severely limit Australia's ability to  continue a proud record of accepting refugees from Africa.

"These comments also send the wrong message on being HIV  positive. Already people who are HIV positive suffer unnecessary  discrimination in our community. The Prime Minister saying that HIV  suffers should be locked out of the country doesn't help.

"It's simply not credible for the Prime Minister to suggest that he is  worried about the cost to our health system to care for these people  when his government is happy to waste hundreds of millions on  advertising each year.

"Australia is a rich country with a strong health system. We can and  should be able to cope with the very small number of refugees who  are HIV positive."
