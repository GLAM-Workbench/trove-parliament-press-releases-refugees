Are Australia's immigration policies a viable model for the UK?

Foreign Policy Centre, London, 10 December 2001

I have been asked to speak about whether Australia’s immigration policies present a viable model for the United Kingdom.

There is a certain irony in this question, given that for much of our history, Australia’s immigration policies were directly related to Britain’s emigration policies.

For Australia, the first of these is that our approach to migrant selection must be strictly non-discriminatory as far as matters such as race, religion, colour or ethnicity are concerned.

A second is that the overall immigration intake must be demonstrably in the national economic interest. It must be responsive to the needs of our industries. The intake is critical to nation-building.

A third core value is that our immigration policies must enable Australians with non-Australian partners or dependent children to be re-united in Australia as permanent residents and, in time, Australian citizens.

Humanitarian assistance for those in need

Since World War Two, Australia has resettled over 600,000 refugees.

Our current humanitarian program annually brings to Australia around 12,000 refugees and others who are in humanitarian need.

Those who close their doors to outsiders, on the other hand, face a bleak future of declining and ageing populations, introspection and cultural attenuation.
