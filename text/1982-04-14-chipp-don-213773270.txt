P R E S S  R E L E A S E 3 ^ THE SENATE CHIPP: A WAY TO PROTECT ETHNIC COMMUNITIES

"It is intolerable that representatives of a foreign power should be

able to threaten and coerce people who have made Australia their

home," Senator Don Chipp, Leader of the Australian Democrats, said today.

He was refering to reports that representatives of a Soviet Government

legal body had contained suitable amounts of money (over $200,000)

from Baltic and East European refugees too frightened to report that

they had been approached by the alleged Soviet agents.

Senator Chipp called for the establishment of a 'safe', confidential

counselling service available to all members of ethnic communities.

"I welcome the concern expressed by the Minister for Immigration and

Ã¢ÂÂ   Ethnic Affairs, the fact that he has orderd an investigation and that

some of the money extorted in this way has apparently been frozen,"

Senator Chipp added.

"However, it is most important to ensure that Australians of whatever

origin are fully protected against harrassment by foreign powers.

Clearly the people concerned were not confident that this protection

was available from the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs

or the Australian Government and this is unacceptable.

"The counselling service should be available from Departmental

officials at top level with adequate security clearances and under

conditions of absolute confidentiality," Senator Chipp said.

"These officers should be able to call on the advice of senior members

of the ethnic communities concerned and where appropriate, such members

could be co-opted to form an advisory committee," Senator. Chipp concluded
