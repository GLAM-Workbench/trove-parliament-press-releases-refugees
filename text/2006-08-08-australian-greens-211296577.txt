Kerry Nettle, Senator for New South Wales

Vanstone must stop whingeing and take action to investigate  the Edmund Rice Centre claims

Senator Nettle, 8th August 2006

Greens Senator Kerry Nettle today called on the Immigration Minster, Senator  Vanstone to investigate the Edmund Rice Centre's claims of the deaths of and dangers  faced by returned asylum seekers.



"It's no good the Minister complaining about ABC publicising the claims of the  Edmund Rice Centre. What she should be doing is investigating these claims,"  Senator Nettle said.

"It appears that this government's aggressive refugee policy has resulted in people  who sought safety in Australia being killed.

"This will happen again unless the processes which led to these people being returned  are changed and the steps taken by the government to assess the dangers asylum  seekers face are improved.

"If the Edmund Rice Centre with its limited resources can find out this information,  then surely the Australian Government with all its resources can investigate these  claims.

"I have asked the Minister on at least three occasions to investigate similar claims by  the Edmund Rice Centre. How can the government know if they have made correct  decisions if they do not monitor the fate of returned asylum seekers?

"The report should send a clear message to politicians that the proposed migration  changes are not just about political manoeuvrings. The decisions of the department of  immigration can lead to the, death of human beings."
