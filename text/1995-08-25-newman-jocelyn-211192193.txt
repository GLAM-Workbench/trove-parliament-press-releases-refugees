NEWS RELEASE FROM

SHADOW MINISTER FOR DEFENCE

25 August 1995

CURTAINS FOR CURTIN FACILITY?

The Federal Government has been called on to stand by its promise to close the  temporary immigration detention facility at RAAF Base Curtin as soon as boat people  numbers declined to the level where all detainees could be reasonably relocated to Port  Hedland.

The Shadow Minister for Defence, Senator Jocelyn Newman, made the call in the light  of this week's deportation of 71 boat people from Port Hedland.

"It was never a satisfactory arrangement to have illegal immigrants housed at a sensitive  defence facility like Curtin. As soon as it is possible to concentrate all of the detainees  at Port Hedland, the Government should do so.

"The presence of these people at Curtin means that the availability of the base for  military purposes is now restricted. It makes a mockery of the Government's defence  preparedness in northern Australia", said Senator Newman.

"If the Government refuses to relocate the Curtin detainees to Port Hedland, it may well  indicate that it has no intention of keeping Senator Bolkus' promise of using RAAF Curtin  as a short-term arrangement to manage the overflow of detainees from the Port Hedland

centre."

"The base is available for use by the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs until  31 March 1996 but I have real concerns that the Government may well decide to  continue to use the Curtin RAAF Base beyond that time," added Senator Newman.

"The Curtin facility should return to its primary function - that of being a military facility  contributing to the defence of Australia."

"I challenge the Federal Government to come clean on its plans for the Curtin base."
