Afghan refugees arriving in Australia from Nauru

VPS 97/2004

A second group of refugees from the 146 Afghan refugees on Nauru will arrive in Australia this evening.

Minister for Immigration, Senator Amanda Vanstone, said this group of arrivals brings to 70 the number of  Afghan refugees resettled in Australia, following the Government's commitment late last year to reassess the  entire Afghan caseload on Nauru, in light of updated information from the UNHCR about changed  circumstances in Afghanistan.

'Of the 146 people reassessed by Australia to be in need of refugee protection, there are 55 children, 70 men  and 21 women,' the Senator Vanstone said.

'The arrival of this group follows the arrival of 35 Afghan refugees from Nauru on the 29th of June.

'In the second group of 35 arriving this evening, there are 15 children, 13 men and seven women.

'They will be resettled in Sydney, Melbourne, regional Victoria, Adelaide, and the ACT. A number of the  arrivals have family members already residing in Australia.

'All of the refugees arriving this evening have been granted secondary movement visas. 18 refugees were  granted five-year visas, the remaining 17 were granted three-year visas.

'These visas are available to people who have abandoned or by-passed effective protection in a country of first  asylum and travelled to another country to seek a preferred migration option.

'Departmental officers are working with the remaining 76 Afghan refugees in the Australian caseload on  Nauru and it is expected most will be resettled to Australia in the coming weeks,' Minister Vanstone said.

'Arrangements are being finalised to bring most of the remaining refugees to Australia, possibly by charter  flight in the week commencing 12 July.'
