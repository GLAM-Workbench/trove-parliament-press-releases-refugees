Time for the Coastguard

Â

Â

It is time for the Government to look at establishing a national coastguard.

Â

More boat arrivals at Christmas Is land overnight carrying some 
150 illegal immigrants makes 5 boats and nearly 700 people in one week.

Â

The Opposition has consistently called on the Government 
to examine an integrated coastguard service to provide proper and effective 
coastal surveillance and protection of our shores.

Â

Even if the present pressures from the current spate 
of illegals from the Middle-East via Indonesia reduce after they either 
arrive or are dissuaded from coming, the problem will remain that we 
are seen as a vulnerable target. We can not allow the message to continue 
that it is easy to enter at will whether smuggling people, drugs, guns 
or wildlife.

Â

The Government is caught in a dilemma of its own making. 
We are seen as having run out of ideas and are helpless to stem the 
tide of breaches into our borders.

Â

The Immigration Minister has recently announced yet 
another inquiry into border control - the third this year by the Government. 
The Australian people expect and deserve an effective response.

Â

The Opposition again urges the Government to consider 
the option of a coordinated and properly resourced coastguard service.
