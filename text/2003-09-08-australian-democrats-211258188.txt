Senator Andrew Bartlett   Leader of the Australian Democrats  September 8, 2003                   MEDIA RELEASE                            03/642

Cruel Treatment of Refugees Must End

The Australian Democrats renew calls for the Government to scrap its policy of only giving  refugees temporary protection.

Democrats’ Leader, Senator Andrew Bartlett, said temporary visas keeps families separated, denies  refugees access to services, and prevents them rebuilding their shattered lives.

Senator Bartlett was speaking at a rally outside Parliament House in Canberra, attended by many  refugees from Iraq who only have temporary visas.

All of these people are living in a situation where they could be ordered to return to Iraq with  virtually no notice.

“This issue is vital as the Government has just moved to prevent more refugees from getting secure  and certain protection, “ Senator Bartlett said.

“Both Liberal and Labor still support temporary visas in some form.

“The Democrats call on the public to express its opposition to this cruel and unnecessary  punishment which inflicts further suffering on genuine refugees.”
