CAIRNS BOAT PEOPLE VICTIMS OF RACKET

Â

26 people who beached their boat on Holloway’s Beach, Cairns on 
12  March this year were victims of an organised people smuggling 
racket, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip 
Ruddock, said today.

Â

Announcing their recent return to China, Mr Ruddock 
said the group - 22 men and four women - had been consistently lied 
to by the operation’s organisers and had paid dearly for their ill-fated 
journey.

Â

“These individuals told us they paid around $US2,500 
each to join the boat and were heading for Sydney where the organisers 
had assured them they would find work.

Â

They were well aware of the risks, and yet were convinced 
it would work for them. For example, they knew an earlier boat carrying 
52 Chinese people had arrived in the Northern Territory on Christmas 
Eve and that one woman had drowned.

Â

“The organisers had lied about the ultimate fate 
of the people on board, saying they had been allowed to stay in Australia 
and were working.

Â

“The Northern Territory group was repatriated in 
January, a full month before this boat left China, and the organisers 
would have been aware that the rort had failed.

Â

“Unfortunately for that group they had also been 
duped. They had been told they would get jobs for the Olympics and that 
there would be an amnesty for illegals in Australia.”

Â

Mr Ruddock said the organisers had lied well, and 
planned this journey expertly.

Â

“The Cairns boat was timed to leave clandestinely 
on 15 February. They had no exit permits from China, so chose to leave 
during the height of Chinese New Year celebrations, when harbour authorities 
might be less vigilant.

Â

“They travelled via the Philippines and Indonesia 
without landing en route, and without making any contact with officials 
in those countries.”

Â

“The 35m boat cost the group nearly $US43,000 to 
purchase and provision. It was well fitted out, with two engines, giving 
it a range of some 4000 miles, global satellite navigation equipment, 
radar, charts, and plenty of fuel. Nevertheless, it beached in Cairns 
with six holes in the hull and engine and gearbox damage.”

Â

Mr Ruddock said that so far this financial year, excluding 
yesterday’s NSW arrival, 21 boats carrying 279 unauthorised arrivals 
arrived in Australia, including 170 Chinese. Most had since left Australia.

Â

“Yesterday’s arrival at Macksville on the New 
South Wales’ coast illustrates the growing trend of unlawful people 
movement and the fact that Australia is increasingly becoming a target

Â

“Australia has an absolute need for a comprehensive 
determination process for unlawful arrivals. A key component of this 
process is the Judicial Review Bill the Government is determined to 
implement.

Â

“This legislation will restrict unlawful arrivals 
from frustrating and delaying their removal through endless court action 
and appeal. However, the Australian Labor Party has indicated they will 
refuse passage of this legislation.

Â

It is crucial that individuals considering illegal 
entry to Australia unambiguously understand that they can not simply 
arrive unlawfully and remain in this country for years pursuing baseless 
claims at the taxpayers expense.

Â

“Unless the ALP are prepared to support the limiting 
of judicial review they are giving tacit approval to those who desire 
to unlawfully make Australia their home.

Â

“People smuggling is one of the most obnoxious rorts anyone can 
experience and is recognised and  condemned world-wide as an unacceptable 
practice.

Â

“This is reflected in the cooperation we receive 
from other Governments, particularly the Chinese, in repatriating those 
who have no right to be in Australia.

Â

“I hope the Chinese community in Australia will 
help to get the message back to China that there is a proper and legal 
way of migrating to Australia and people smuggling is not it.”
