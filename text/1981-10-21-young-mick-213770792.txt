PRESS RELEASE FROM MICK YOUNG, SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND ETHNIC AFFAIRS

ANYONE ELSE BUT VINER

There has been a lot of speculation about the MinistryÂ­ being reshuffled when the House gets into recess.

"I say quite categorically on behalf of the ethnic communities  of Australia that we do not want the Minister for Industrial  Relations, Mr Viner, shoved off to Immigration and Ethnic  Affairs," said Mick Young last night speaking on the budget

estimates. .

"We consider the policies and problems of migrants and  refugees and the past settlement services of the ethnic  communities in Australia far too important to be given  over to a person such as the Hon.  Member for Stirling.

"I think he should be shoved off to the back benches because  he has made a mess of Aboriginal Affairs, Industrial  Relations and he is not trusted by anybody in the community.

"We certainly do not want the Hon. Member for Stirling  shoved off to the ethnic communities of this country  because he is not wanted by anybody else."
