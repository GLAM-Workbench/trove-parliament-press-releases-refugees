VPS 78/2004

Minister for Immigration, Amanda Vanstone, today announced that the final group of people had been  transferred from the Port Hedland Immigration Reception and Processing Centre (IRPC) to the Baxter  Immigration Detention Facility (IDF) near Port Augusta.

'A total of 50 people, all single males and mostly nationals from Afghanistan, Iran and Sri Lanka, were  transferred to the Baxter IDF in three groups over the last 10 days,' Minister Vanstone said.

'The decommissioning of the Port Hedland IRPC is a direct result of the success of the Government's  strategies to target illegal migration, which has seen the number of people arriving unlawfully by boat  virtually cease, creating an opportunity to consolidate the number of centres in Australia.'

Baxter has a capacity for up to 880 people and has ample room to accommodate the people from Port  Hedland.

Senator Vanstone said action is now underway to decommission and mothball Port Hedland and the  residential housing project (RHP) to ensure the facilities are maintained in a state of readiness, should  additional capacity be required in the future.

The Minister said that the focus is now on establishing additional family-friendly RHPs in Perth and Sydney  where they are most needed.

'Refugee advocates have welcomed the RHPs, which have proved to be very successful alternatives for  women and children in immigration detention, allowing them to live in a low security, community-like  environment,' the Minister said.
