Thank you very much Jeff Kcnnett, the Premier o f Victoria, to Michelle Penson, the  Liberal Parly candidate for Jaga Jaga. I ’ ve got to say you really have the scent o f a  political fight in your nostrils when you come to a great gathering like this, just over three  weeks out from judgement day on the second o f March, in an election which w e’re going  to take away from the Labor Party. To all o f my federal parliamentary colleagues, and can  I particularly acknowledge the presence here tonight of my friend and colleague, Senator  Jim Short, who is the Shadow Minister tor immigration and Ethnic Affairs. Jim has done  an absolutely suburb job in putting together the Immigration and Ethnic Affairs Policies  which I am formally launching as I speak - the M l policies having been made available to  the media late this afternoon will be available to all party members from now - but Jim has  done an absolutely tireless and extr emely conscientious job in working in that position. He  lias befriended all o f the different ethnic communities ati over Australia and I ’m constantly  amazed as 1 go amongst them by the stories people tett me of Jim’s hard work. So thank  you very much, Jim. I also want to acknowledge the presence here tonight o f many other

candidates. I think it’s a symbol o f the growing diversity of the parliamentary ranks o f the  Liberal Party that we should have o f course Phillip Raressi, bom in Italy, and one o f our  great candidates for the seat o f Deakin - well he’s the only candidate for the seat of Deakin  as far as I’m concerned. And only a few months ago - well a bit over a few months now -  it was 12 months ago, Petro Georgiou became the Liberal member for Kooyong- And I  think most of those are examples o f the growing diversity o f our party, the rightfully  growing diversity, the increasing extent to wliicli it is representing all sections o f the  AustraEan community. And one of the great things about the liberal Party, one o f its most

enduring and one o f its most attractive qualities, really one o f the reasons why T joined the  Liberal Party intuitively, why I’ve always remained so devoted and attached to it is that, of  all the political parties in Australia, the liberal Parly is the one party that is owned by no

one section o f the Australian community but is the property of the great cross-section o f  tire main stream o f Australian society.

And it is one o f the great differences between us and them. We are not owned by the  business community, but we understand the business community. Many of you here  tonight come out o f the ranks o f small business in Australia. T grew up in a small business

background and l  was taught that one o f the greatest things yon can ever do to live out the  Australian dream was to start with nothing arid to work your heart out during your- working  life to build up a  business and to leave something behind to your children. And that has  been the story, and that, of course, has been the great story o f so many people who have  made Australia their homo from other parts o f lire world particularly since the end nf  World WarH.

When I became Leader o f the Liberal Party on the 30th o f January last year, I said that a  certain number o f principles were going to instruct and guide that leadership. And one of  the principles was my passionate belief in an AustraBan society composed o f people drawn  from all comers o f  the globe but united behind some basic common Australian values. And that really is the story o f the modem post war Australia. It's a different Australia to  what it was before the war. We have carried forward the best o f our past and we have  blended it with new and different, more exciting, more enriclimg ways o f doing things. And the product has been a unique, special, tolerant society, preserving that great  egalitarian tradition which has always been particularly Australian by combining with it a  greater sophistication and understanding of different attitudes and different cultures. And  in the process we have forged a special society. And the policies that i have launched  tonight recommit the liberal and National Parties to those principles.

Those policies recall the great post war immigration work o f the Menzies’ Govemmctit. It  was under Coalition governments dial hundreds ol thousands, indeed millions o f people  came to this country - first from Western Europe, then from Southern Europe, then from  the Middle East, then from all parts o f Asia and from South America. As Jeff Kennett  mentioned, two o f the great humanitarian achievements o f post war immigration in

Australia were under Liberal Governments. It was the Liberal Government o f Harold Holt  that finally ended die White Australia Policy. And it was the Liberal Government of  Malcolm Fraser, o f which I was a member, that opened the doors o f Australia to IndoÂ­ Chinese refugees in the late 1970s. And it remains to the great humanitarian credit o f the  Liberal Party that by that act this country on a per capita basis took more refugees from  Tndo-China than any other nation in the world. And let it be remembered, particularly in  an election campaign, when I here these stupid cries of harbouring racists in our party,  from the Prime Minister, let it be remembered that in the late 1970s, when we were trying

to win acceptance o f that policy o f settling Indo-Chinese refugees in Australia  Wc didn’t get any help or co-operation from Gough Whitiam or Bob Hawke. We got  obstruction and difficulty and criticism from both of them in their respective positions.

And so many of the great initiatives that have built the modem multicultural Australia have  come from our side of politics and I intend in the government I hope to lead after the 2nd  o f March, I intend to continue that tradition. I intend to lead a government that presides  over a country which does not have any stain o f racism within its borders; a country that  treats people in a decent fashion on the basis of ability and merit; a country that chooses its  immigrants without regard to colour or religion or nationality or country o f origin; a nation  that looks to the quality o f people; a nation that believes devoutly in the individual; a nation

driven by the belief that creating a climate in which all Australians can aspire to achieve the  best that their talents will allow - is the kind of society I want to build.

And one of the reasons that I think that our Party has always had a particular affinity with  so many o f the ethnic communities that make-up our modem nation is that we have so  many fundamental values in common. We believe very strongly as a Party, and you as  communities believe very strongly that the family is the great building block o f a cohesive  society. But at the end o f the day most of us draw nnr pastoral and spiritual and emotional  nourishment from a stable home life and a stable family and the greatest gift that anybody

can have and the greatest gift anybody can bestow is the gift o f a happy family life - and  that is something to which the Liberal Patty has always attached enormous importance.  And in so many ways people that have made Australia their home in past decades have  contributed to the enrichment o f family life in tlds country. And it has set examples of  family commitment and family devotion that so many o f us would do well to emulate.

And we move on from that and we come again o f course to the importance in our  community of small business. As I go around the different ethnic communities of Australia  so many o f them are really the heart and soul of what small business is ail about and I have  said a great deal about small business in this election campaign, because I happen to believe  that if you are really serious about reducing unemployment in tills country and I ’m sorry to  say, and I think it’s a great blight on the policies o f the present Government, that there are  some very high levels o f unemployment, sadly high amongst some o f our ethnic  communities. And the way in wilich you can most effectively reduce unemployment in this  country, particularly amongst young Australians, is to got the Government off the back o f  small business and to get small business rc-cticrgiscd and re-invigorated again.

As I survey the landscape o f small business and you look at the sort o f burdens they cany -  you think o f M r Brereton’s ridiculous anti-employment, job destroying, unfair dismissal  law. I want to say to you that one o f the first things that I will do to help small business  after the 2nd o f March is to throw out that ridiculous unfair dismissal law and replace it  with one that is fair to both sides.

I ’ve already announced, at the beginning o f the campaign, the change in the provisional tax  ammgements - to reduce the provisional tax uplift factor from 8 per cent to 6 per cent and  that in cash flow terms will benefit particularly the small business community o f Australia  as well as many retired people and many fanners. I ’ve committed a future Coalition  government to the establishment o f a business deregulation task force and its role will be to  recommend to me as Prime Minister, within six months of a change of government, steps  that will lead to a reduction of 50 per cent in the paperwork burden of small business.

And you know one o f the reasons why you get these sort of laws from the present  Government is that it’s composed of people who know notliing at all about small business  because they’ve never had any first hand, hands on experience of how a small business  operates. They don’t realise that the average small business man or woman doesn’t have  the resources to employ a human resources officer. That the average small business  operator is simultaneously the managing director, the sales manager’, the chief accountant,  tire human resources officer, the chief counsellor, the bottle washer and everything wrapped  in one. Now that is how the average small business has to operate and he gets these isolated

out-of-touch ivoiy tower inhabitants - all of whom have come out o f four categories o f  occupations - they’re either former academics, former trade union officials, former  bureaucrats or former Labor Party apparatchiks. And could I say to you, I mean ÃÂª don’t  object to the first three categories - T’m happy to have as many trade unionists as you like  in the Liberal Party; I ’m  happy to have academics; I’m happy to have public servants - I  draw tire line at Labor Party apparatchiks I’ve got to tell you.

But that’s because their Party is made up o f people who don’t understand small business -  that they don’t understand that unless you give it incentives to employ people; unless you  Hit the burden o f paperwork; unless you change the capital gains tax in a sensible way as  we intend to do in relation to roll-overs - when you sell one business and hold the proceeds  to put into another. Unless you do things like that you’re not going to give them the  incentive to thrive and the incentive to employ people. So that’s a second link, special link  between the values o f ethnic communities and the values of the I Jberal Party.

And the third o f course is that great sense o f community that we all have in the broad  sense, Australia’s greatest strengths include a spirit of volunteer effort - the great egalitarian  tradition o f Australia. The ability and the willingness to help your mates in a time of stress  and strain is one o f our most endearing and enduring characteristics as a nation. And the  ethnic communities in their own particular way have contributed to it And as Jeff Kcnnett  said we have produced a remarkably harmonious society. The doomsayers and the sceptics  and the critics are only too ready lo suggest that on occasions when difficulties occur in  oilier parts o f the world those difficulties are going to be unreasonably projected into  communities in Australia. The reality o f course is that hasn’t happened and I think it is a  remarkable tribute to the vast bulk of the ethnic communities of Australia that even though  they have understandable and deeply held passions about what is happening in their former  homelands, they have always remembered that their overriding commitment is to the unity

and the stability of the Australian nation. And time and time again they have proved the  critics and the sceptics and the doomsayers wrong. And when you think o f the tremendous  stress and pain and trauma that must have been imposed on so many Australians whose  ancestry is traced, many o f whom were bom in the former Yugoslavia, have through all the  traumas of recent years I think it is a remarkable tribute to the Australians who owe their  origins to that part o f the world, many o f whom were bom there, that despite the deep  feelings they must have had their loyalty and commitment to Australia always occupied  pride o f place.

So ladies and gentlemen there are many things that bind the Liberal Party and the ethnic  communities o f Australia together.

The most important tiring in public life, and the most important tiling in the philosophy o f  any political movement and of any political party, are its fundamental values, A political  party exists to win office not for its own sake, It exists to win office to implement a  program and to live out its belief in certain values about the kind o f society we ought to be.

There are so many things about this nation that, realty no matter what our ethnic  background may be, that wo can clearly identify as being Australian. We do have a great

4-

spirit o f tolerance. We do have a proper scepticism towards those who would seek to ram  their politically correct view o f what Australia ought to he down our throats. One o f the  great endearing characteristics o f an Australian lias always boon the scepticism and reserve  about those who would seek to tell us what our identity is rather than properly allowing US  to live out our own beliefs as to what our identity should be.

This idea that you can bottle up the Australian national identity, give it a label and say,  “that’s what it’s going to be”, is something that is quite alien to the Australian character. I  will have nothing o f those self-appointed cultural dietitians who will try and list what ought

to be the qualities o f Australians instead o f accepting that the process o f nation building,  the process o f forging an identity is an evolutionary one influenced by successive events.

The Australian character today is different from the Australian character o f 40 or 50 years  ago and the Australian character in 40 or 50 years’ time will be different again. That is not  to say that the great characteristics we had 40 or 50 years ago we have lost. The art of  successful forging of an evolving national identity is to preserve the good tilings from the  past, to let slide the not-so-good things, and to take upon yourself, as you go through flic  decades, changing influences.

The successive waves o f immigration to Australia have forged a different Australian  character. It’s not unrecognisable from what it was 40 or 50 years ago - it’s just a bit  different and it’s going to be a bit different again in 30, 40, or 50 years time. The  important thing is for all o f us to understand that process. Never to be frightened by it,  never to be intimidated by it, always to respect the past - but never be dwarfed by or  dominated by the past - always ready to receive new ideas but never accepting: that because  it’s new it’s automatically better.

The art o f good State craft has always been to preserve from the past what is good and add  to it what is better from the future. Equally, the art. o f identifying the national character,  the art o f building the Australian identity is also to hang on to those great things of our past  which we all intuitively recognise as being undeniably Australian but to accept the  beneficial change that successive waves of immigration have made to this country' and to  always remember that with the exception of the original inhabitants o f this country we all  are directly or indirectly immigrants - every last man ahd woman o f us.

Ladies and gentlemen, I have to say that doesn’t represent a  word for word recapitulation  of what is in the formal document that I have released tonight enshrining our immigration  and ethnic affairs policy. It represents my summation, in my own very direct language of  what I feel about tile character o f this country, the commitment I have as a political leader  to the principles o f tolerance and diversity, the passion o f beliefl have that the greatest  privilege anybody can have in this world is to Jive in Australia, the gratitude that all of us  ought to have as Australians at the remarkable degree u f harmony and peace and coÂ­ operation that we find in our nation.

I hope that I have expressed to you die very strong commitment o f the Liberal Party of the  1990s to a long continuity o f those values of tolerance and understanding that have marked

previous Coalition administrations because what the Fraser Government did, in particular,  in forging multicultural policies has laid llie foundation of many policies which the current  Government erroneously claims as being inventions o f its own. They are great masters -  m y current political opponents - o f grabbing hold o f anything that’s working and  pretending that they invented i t

If you listen to the Prime Minister - who regularly flew over the capitals o f Asia in his haste  to get to Paris before he became Prime Minister - you would imagine that he all on his own  discovered that the nations o f the Asian Pacific region were important to Australia,  forgetting of course that the Japan Australia Trade Agreement in 1957 was authored by

John McEwen, the Deputy Prime Minister in the then Coalition Government, that many of  the original links were put down by Richard Casey when he was Minister for External  Affairs in the Coalition Government. In their own ways, Gough Whitlam, Malcolm Fraser  and Bob Hawke - from different sides o f politics - continued the tradition o f building our  relations with that part o f the world.

But we are invited to believe - just as on occasions those who see things from the Labor  Patty’s point o f view invite us to believe that Australian history began in 1972 - so it is that  we are invited to believe that Paul John Keating discovered the importance o f the Asian  Pacific region to Australia. That is a palpable distortion and a monstrous re-writing o f

Australian history. It’s our obligation - my obligation, your obligation - as supporters o f  tiie Liberal cause to see that that great lie is effectively nailed.

Ladies and gentlemen, let me finish by saying one final thing to you. That is that I don’t  think the Prime Ministership o f Australia, which, is the most honourable office that any  Australian can aspire to, I don’t  seek it on some land o f rotation principle. I don’t seek it

because it’s my turn and that I  think the other fellow ought to stand down because it’s my  turn. I seek it because I believe that the current occupant o f the job has been an extremely  poor Prime Minister. He talks about leadership as though leadership was something

separate from what the leader does to the led, I would have thought that the measure of  the strength and the ability - the performance - o f the leader, is what the leader does with  his or her responsibility.

I find it impossible to accept that somebody can claim to have been a strong leader if  he’s  led us to record levels of foreign debt, if he’s led us to a greater gap between rich and poor  than we’ve known since World War ÃÂ , if he’s led us to the highest current account deficit  in the western world in 1995, if he’s led m  to almost 30% youth unemployment, if lie’s led

us to record business bankruptcies. Only a few years ago he led us into the deepest  recession we have experienced in over 60 years - when more than 1 million Australians  were out o f work. Yet we are invited to believe that somehow or another you can separate

the performance o f the leader irom the identity o f the leader and the quality o f the leader.  It’s an absurd and it’s an illogical proposition. I believe increasingly people w E see the  unsustainability of the argument that leadership as such can exist in a vacuum separate and

distinct from the performance of the leader.

Ladies and gentlemen, we have had a good start in die election campaign but we have a  veiy long way to go. D on’t anybody imagine that this campaign has been won just because  we’ve had a few encouraging opinion polls. We have three very long weeks ahead o f us.  Anything can happen in that period o f time. D ial famous cliche o f die late Harold

Wilson’s about a week being a long time iu polities means that three weeks before an  election is an absolute eternity. We will experience every day of that eternity - all o f us -  and I exhort you, particularly here in Jaga Jaga, to work politically as you have never  worked before because there’s a lot riding on it. There are millions o f people around  Australia who are desperate for a change o f government: and they are reposing their hopes  in people like you. They represent the great mainstream o f the Australian community. They are people who wore bom in this country, they’re people who have immigrated to  tills country or who are the first generation children o f people who’ve immigrated to this  country. They are all sorts o f Australians but they want a change o f government and we  have a very important responsibility.

So the very last thing that I say to you, ladies and gentlemen, is that I and my colleagues  seek tire Prime Ministership and the government o f this country not on any kind o f rotation  principle. First and foremost we seek it became we believe that this countiy needs a  change of government and we believe that we can give to all of the Australian people better  government, more honest government, more accountable government and more  representative government for all o f the Australian people.

Thank you.
