REMEMBER THE PACIFIC SOLUTION WAS TO DETER PEOPLE-SMUGGLING? UNDER THE HOWARD GOVERNMENT WE NOW HAVE A QUESTION OF TAXPAYER-FUNDED PEOPLE SMUGGLING

Today’s report on Australian taxpayer-funded people smuggling fundamentally undermines the integrity of the Howard Government’s so-called policy of deterrence against people smuggling.

On the one hand, we have had the Howard Government stating that its entire strategy through the so-called “Pacific Solution” is to deter people smugglers from coming to Australia.  But on the other hand what we have now is a report that an agent of the Australian Government has been taking Australian taxpayer dollars while himself reportedly engaged in significant people smuggling.

Based on the report, the Australian agent in question may well have been responsible for three and perhaps more boatloads of asylum-seekers being smuggled successfully into Australia.

The essence of the report is as follows:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ An agent of the Australian Government (through the Australian Federal Police (AFP)) living in West Timor was paid by the AFP to provide information on people smuggling (both the agent himself and the AFP have confirmed this);

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The agent himself, however, was reportedly engaged in at least three and possibly more acts of people smuggling between West Timor and the Kimberleys; Ã¢ÂÂ¢ This was despite the fact that the Indonesian immigration authorities reportedly advised the Australian Government that the agent in question was in fact a

people smuggler.  This raises the fundamental question of why the Australian Government apparently took no action against this agent.  (It also raises the question of just how dysfunctional the Australia-Indonesia relationship has become.)

These are matters of the first importance as they go to the heart of both the integrity and the effectiveness of the Howard Government’s so-called deterrent policy embodied in the Pacific Solution.  They therefore demand an immediate and detailed response from the Howard Government.
