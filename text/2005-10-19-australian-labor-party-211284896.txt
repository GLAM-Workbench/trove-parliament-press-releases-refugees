Living in Harmony funding for Newcastle University and  the Mayfield Mainstreet Committee

Member for Newcastle Sharon Grierson today announced Commonwealth grants totalling  $63,655 to two Newcastle organisations.

“I am pleased to announce that the Mayfield Mainstreet Committee has received $13,655 in  funding for their project Local People - Global Friends, while Newcastle University’s Cross  Cultural Awareness and Communication - Promoting Acceptance of CALD (Culturally and  Linguistically Diverse) Communities project has received $50,000 in funding.” Ms Grierson said.

“The Local People - Global Friends project will see the development of a film documentary  about the journeys of Newcastle’s African refugees and aims to address the discrimination  issues affecting newly arrived refugees. Newcastle University’s project was initiated in response  to discrimination experienced by African migrants and Asian students in the local area and will  develop a resource kit for business and service organisations.”

“These are excellent initiatives supporting harmony in the Newcastle community, and I  congratulate both organisations on their commitment to building stronger cross-cultural  relationships,” Ms Grierson said.
