An external reference group comprising a former Coalition Minister 
for Immigration, a former  Labor Minister for Immigration and 
a former chief of the RAAF have indicated the Government response to 
the recent boat arrivals is both fair and appropriate.

Â

Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, 
Phillip Ruddock formed the External Reference Group to advise on Australia's 
effectiveness in combating people smuggling.

Â

The ERG includes former Liberal Minister for Immigration 
and Ethnic Affairs

(1982-83), John Hodges, former Chief of Air Force 
(1987-92), Air Marshall Ray Funnell and former Labor Minister for Immigration, 
Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (1990-93), Gerry Hand.

Â

“The reference group has given me an interim briefing 
on their activities and they have indicated they will endorse the action 
taken by the Government to date in response to the growing problem of 
unauthorised arrivals,’  1  
Mr Ruddock said.

Â

"It is particularly pleasing to note the support 
our measures has received from former Ministers Hodges and Hand. Mr 
Hand was Minister at a time when Australia was just beginning to really 
experience the growing wave of illegal boat arrivals and Mr Hodges also 
was required to deal with issues relating illegal immigration when he 
was Minister.

Â

“Mr Funnell assured me he saw this as a complex 
issue, which could not be solved with glib simplistic solutions.

Â

“The Government has responded to the latest upsurge 
in the dehumanising and exploitative crime of people smuggling with 
a range of measures designed to maintain an orderly and planned humanitarianÂ program,” 
Mr Ruddock said.

Â

The Government’s response has been to significantly 
increase the penalties for people smuggling, undertake information campaigns 
in source countries and to reduce the incentive for people to bypass 
the off-shore processing by not providing permanent residence on arrival.

Â

“The ERG has recognised the importance of the initial 
three year temporary Protection Visa offered to unauthorised arrivals 
who meet the refugee criteria. It brings Australia’s refugee response 
more into line with many other countries and reduces the incentive for 
people to queue jump,” Mr Ruddock said.

Â

“It is also clear the Government's Border Protection 
Bill, currently before Parliament should receive quick passage to enable 
Australia to interdict and arrest people smugglers in international 
waters,” Mr Ruddock said.

Â

The external reference group is expected to finalise 
its report within the next couple of weeks.
