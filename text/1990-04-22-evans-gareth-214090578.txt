The Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Mr Duffy, today announced the appointment of Mr Frank Murray  as High Commissioner in Malaysia. Mr Murray succeeds Mr Cavan  Hogue who has been High Commissioner since 1987.

Australia and Malaysia have a common interest in the  stability and economic development of the Asia-Pacific region.  Both share a long history of active and cooperative relations  in a wide range of activities, including defence, trade and

investment, education, health, narcotics control,  refugee  resettlement and aviation.

The Malaysian economy has shown resilience and a  steady growth rate with a rapidly expanding and diversifying  manufacturing sector. Foreign investment is surging. Our  bilateral trade was valued at A$1.4 billion in 1988/89. Both

countries have expressed a keen interest in increasing trade  and investment links further as well as continuing their  cooperation on multilateral trade issues in the Cairns Group.
