Health Issues at Curtin and Woomera IRPCs MPS 007/2001

The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock, has confirmed today, in response to enquiries, that six cases of typhoid fever have been identified at the Immigration Reception and Processing Centres at Curtin and Woomera.

Five of these cases are from Curtin while the sixth is from Woomera and all involve recent boat arrivals.

"My Department has been advised by medical experts that risk of transmission of typhoid fever is unlikely," Mr Ruddock said.

"Nonetheless, three people were hospitalised and the others are under constant observation and are being treated by doctors at the centres."

In addition, the Minister said that all detainees are regularly provided with hygiene education and detention centre staff are currently reinforcing the importance of this.

"My Department is working closely with state health authorities in the management of these cases," Mr Ruddock said.
