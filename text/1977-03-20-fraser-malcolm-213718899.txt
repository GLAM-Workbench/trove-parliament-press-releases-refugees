ELECTORATE TALK

For most Australians, and probably for most men and women in the

modern world, the size and complexity of Governments can be  ovarxxrhelming.  People often see Government departments as having  little concern for individual problems; and little concern for  individual justice. They feel' overpowered, confused and lost by  what they see as red tape and rigid guidelines having no relevance

to their own personal needs. They feel that Governments, at all

levels, have vast powers over individuals, almost unchallengable  power.

There is no doubt that Australians do need protection for their  basic human rights in this highly complex area of Government  administration. There is no doubt that this protection has been  delayed for too long.

This week, that situation was considerably rectified xvlth the  appointment of a Commonwealth Ombudsman. The Ombudsman, supported  by two Deputy Ombudsmen, will be a powerful servant acting in the

best interests of individuals. His duties are specific. Basically,  he will be required to investigate complaints about administrative  actions of Government officials. He will be mainly concerned by  the way in which officials have handled the matter in question. He will be looking at alleged bias, neglect, delay, incompetence,

or any other complaints that can be generally classified as bad  administration. His power's will span any Commonwealth department,  statutory authority or any other Commonwealth agency.

Under law, the Commonwealth Ombudsman will have the power to gain  immediate access to documents or premises. He will be able to

interviexÂ·? officials or anyone else who may be able to assist his  enquiries. If the Ombudsman finds that some remedy is required to

correct a wrong decision, he will make recommendations to theÂ·  relevant department and to its Minister. If he then finds that

corrective action has not been taken to his complete satisfaction,  the Ombudsman has the power to report the matter directly to me as

Prime Minister and to the Parliament. This means, of course, that

in some cases the Prime Minister can, and will, intervene directly  on behalf of the citizen.

The strength of the O m b u d s m a n '  $  work lies in the independence,  and impartiality of his i n v e s t i g a t i o n .  He is outside the influence  and control of any Government d e p a r t m e n t .  His judgements are based  solely on his own experience and capacity. Of c o u r s e ,  the Ombudsman

will Â±>e answerable directly to the people through the Federal  Parliament.. He will make an annual report to the Parliament

and additional periodical reports as necessary.

The concept of an Ombudsman is not unique to Australia. It first

emerged, in the Scandinavian countries early in the 19th c e n t u r y . New Zealand, appointed an Ombudsman in 1962 and. the United Kingdom  followed five years /iater.  Six of the Canadian provinces have  O m b u d s m e n .  T o d a y ,  five of the six Australian states have established

the office in the last five years.

The appointment of a Commonwealth Ombudsman inÂ·Australia is an  important step forward, in enhancing human rights. It is in line  w i t h  a number of other m e a s u r e s ,  such as the Administrative Appeals  T r i b u n a l ,  that have been taken by this. Government to put people

first and to protect basic individual rights.

We believe, that people expect Governments to serve their i n t e r e s t s ,   and not the contrary.

The appointment of a Commonwealth Ombudsman gives practical meaning  to this p h i l o s o p h y .  It again demonstrates our a b i l i t y ,  and our  r e c o r d ,  of turning promise into a c h i e v e m e n t .
