ELECTORATE TALK

(The weekly Prime Ministerial electorate talk is today given  by the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs, Mr Neil Brown)

I wish to talk to you today about the positive action that is  being taken by the Government to help young people.  Let me say  at the outset - and there should be no doubt about this -  that the Government is committed to increasing education,

training and work experience opportunities for the young.  By increasing these opportunities we will ensure that young  people can share in the prosperity of Australia,  take advantage  of the expanding labour market and obtain stable and rewarding  employment.

The challenges have been to get the economy moving; to increase  the number of permanent jobs available; to make the education  system more responsive to the needs of the young;  to ensure  young people acquire the skills and experience which they need  and which employers seek;  and to provide better guidance on  careers,

The responsible policies pursued by the Government on the  i economic front have been successful in expanding activity  and confidence in the private sector and producing higher  employment growth.  Full-time employment has grown by 5.3%

over the last two years. The growth in full-time employment  for 15 to 19 year olds was over 6%. The Government's  achievements to date are encouraging, but more needs to be  done. I can assure you the Government will vigorously pursue

its efforts to build on this success. .  ’

During this year, substantial funds will be expended on manpower  and training programmes by the Government with particular  emphasis on young people. ,

School to Work Transition

The Government's School to Work Transition policy provides  education and training opportunities within schools and TAPE  colleges. We have committed ourselves to expend $150 million  over five years and in 1981/82 a total of 16,000 young people  will be assisted to attend educational programmes, pre-vocational

courses, pre-employment }  courses and pre-apprenticeship courses. To encourage young people to enter such courses the Government  pays a pays a transition allowance which is higher than the  unemployment benefit. _

Skill Training

A number of new initiatives to provide skill training have been  taken by the Government. We have substantially increased  grants to TAFE colleges for this purpose - $206.8 million  in 1981/82, we will pay $72 million to employers under CRAFT

this year in respect of 9 5,0 00 apprentices, we have allocated. $8 million to the Skills in Demand Programme - under which  almost 70% of the training places approved to date have  involved people under 25 years of age - and, $5.3 million

is available to aid and stimulate the development of training  programmes through all sectors of industry and commerce.

Work Experience and Training

The Government has taken action to ensure young people acquire  the skills and experience which they need and which employers  seek by establishing the Special Youth Employment Training  Programme. This programme will provide nearly 70,000 new  places this year.

Counselling and Job Placement

The Commonwealth Employment Service in 1980/81 increased the  number of people under 21 years referred for job interviews  by 20% and increased the placement of these young people by  18%. Also, the CES has expanded its programmes on occupational

information and has developed career reference centres and work  information centres. Ã¢ÂÂ

The Government's Record .  .

If you want confirmation of the real commitment of the  Government in work experience and training, you should look  at the Government's record over recent years. Expenditure in  1979/80 was $112 million; 1980/81 was $165 million; and 1981/82  * will be $203 million. Whilst expenditure figures alone do not

tell the full story it should be recognised that these are  expenditure on targetted programmes to help young people who  need work experience and training to obtain permanent employment  They exclude educational expenditure on the school to work

transition programme and the education programme for unemployed  youth. Under our programmes, over 210,000 young persons will be  assisted this financial year - higher than at any other time.

If it emerges that some young people are unable to use the  expanded opportunities provided by our extensive range of  programmes because of their geographic location or because  of their personal unsuitability to the present programmes,

the Government will, ofÂ· course, look very closely at the need  for different or new forms.of assistance or special programmes.  This demonstrates that the Government has a firm commitment  to assist the youth of Australia and help them to take an  active and constructive role in society.

National Youth Advisory -Group

A further illustration of the Government's interest in young  people is the National Youth Advisory Group. The group provides  the Government with advice on young people's needs and concerns;   informs the Government of the impact of its programmes ;

affecting young people; and suggests ways of improving  communication links between young people and the Government.

The success of the group shows that the Government has here  an influential body which can provide a very valuable link  between the youth community of Australia and the Government.

Before leaving you this evening, I would like to refer to the  latest monthly labour force survey which illustrates the Â·   positive contribution the Government is making to youth  employment. Over the year to August 1981, the level of teenage

full-time unemployment fell by 17.6%; the number of teenagers  seeking full-time employment fell by 19,600 ; the number of  teenagers looking for their first full-time job fell by  15,700; and the number of 15-19 year olds seeking other than  their first job fell by 3,900.

Whilst some young people are experiencing problems in finding  employment, we are determined to help them in their endeavours  to find suitable employment by strong and positive: action.

As Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs I am particularly  concerned to ensure the needs of young people are considered  by the Government and that programmes of assistance are instituted  to meet those needs where necessary. It is important for  Australia that the young people be given every assistance

and encouragement as they are our hope for the future.
