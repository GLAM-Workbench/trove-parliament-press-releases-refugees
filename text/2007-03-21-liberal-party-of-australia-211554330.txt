Outreach visits come to the central west

Wednesday, 21 March 2007

Officers from the Department of Immigration and Citizenship (DIAC) will be in  Orange and Bathurst next week as part of a regional outreach visit.

The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship Kevin Andrews said the outreach  trips were a great way for people in regional areas to sit down and talk about  immigration-related issues face-to-face with DIAC officers.

‘DIAC places great importance on providing services to regional areas and  these visits are a large part of that,’ Mr Andrews said.

‘These appointments attract a range of people, from farmers to small business  owners, community groups to individuals, who might want information or just  someone to talk them through a complex matter.

‘While the Department has a great deal of information available over the  phone or on the internet, some people prefer to speak to officers face-to-face,  and these visits are about meeting that need.

‘In the past, we have found that the most popular topics relate to citizenship,  work visas, visas for family members and how to propose and sponsor  refugees,’ Mr Andrews added.

The DIAC team is also visiting Dubbo, Wellington, Lightning Ridge, Mudgee  and Lithgow during this tour.
