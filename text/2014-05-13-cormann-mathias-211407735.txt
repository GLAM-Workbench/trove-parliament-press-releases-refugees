DELIVERING A SMALLER, MORE RATIONAL GOVERNMENT

The Abbott Government will drive major reforms to ensure the public service is as efficient,  as effective and as accountable as possible.

This will involve the abolition or merger of Government bodies where possible, to eliminate  duplication, remove waste, streamline Government services and reduce the cost of  government administration for taxpayers.  These reforms are expected to deliver net savings of about $500 million over the forward

estimates.

In recent years the number of different government bodies has grown out of control.

There are now so many different Commonwealth bodies that there is no actual authoritative  and definitive figure.

The National Commission of Audit estimated that there were around 900 bodies. Further  research by the Department of Finance prepared for the 2014-15 Budget found the number is  closer to 1,000 different government bodies.

With so many bodies and agencies, many with overlapping responsibilities, lines of  accountability are blurred and action can too often be uncoordinated. All of this is confusing  and unnecessarily costly for the community.

The first phase of the Abbott Government's Smaller Government Reform Agenda was  implemented after the 20 13 Election and reduced the number of government bodies by 40,  including through:

The merger of AusAID into the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade;  The merger of Resources, Energy and Tourism into the Industry Department;  The merger of functions of the Department of Regional Australia, Local Government,  Arts and Sport into other departments;  The abolition of 23 non-statutory advisory bodies including: the Social Inclusion  Board; the Australian Animals Welfare Advisory Committee; the Commonwealth  Firearms Advisory Council; the International Legal Services Advisory Council; the  National Intercountry Adoption Advisory Group; the National Steering Committee on  Corporate Wrongdoing; the Antarctic Animal Ethic Committee; the Advisory Panel  on the Marketing in Australia of Infant Formula; the High Speed Rails Advisory  Group; the Maritime Workforce Development Forum; the Advisory Panel on Positive

Ageing; the Insurance Reform Advisory Group; the National Housing Supply  Council; the National Policy Commission on Indigenous Housing; the National  Children and Family Roundtable; the Prime Minister's Council on Homelessness; the  Pulp and Paper Advisory Group; International Pro Bono Advisory Group; the  National Alternative Dispute Resolution Advisory Council; the Centre for Workplace

Leadership Advisory Group; the National Council for Education for Sustainability;  and the National Sustainability Council; the Procurement Consultative Committee;  The commencement of the process to sell Medibank Private;  The abolition of the Climate Commission, Energy Security Council, the Independent  Inspector General of Animal Welfare and Live Animal Exports, the Pharmaceutical  Benefits Pricing Authority, the Coordinator-General for Remote Indigenous Services,  the National Gambling Regulator;  The introduction of legislation to abolish the Climate Change Authority, the Clean  Energy Finance Corporation, and the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits  Commission;  The merger of the Grape and Wine Research and Development Corporation and Wine  Australia to create the Australian Grape and Wine Authority; and  The replacement of the Office of Fair Work Building Industry Inspectorate with the  Australian Building and Construction Commission, replacing the Aged Care

Standards and Accreditation Agency Ltd with the Australian Aged Care Quality  Agency.

The second phase of the Abbott government's Smaller Government Reform Agenda will be  implemented in the 2014-1 5 Budget and deliver a further reduction of 36 government bodies.

That reduction will be achieved through abolitions, consolidations of functions into  departments, mergers and by exploring fiu-ther opportunities for privatisations, including:

The abolition of the:

Abalone Aquaculture Health Accreditation Workshop  Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation  Australian Renewable Energy Agency  Australian River Co. Limited

Corporations and Markets Advisory Committee and its Legal Committee;  National Water Commission  COAG Reform Council  Office of the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor; and

Prime Minister's Indigenous Business Policy Advisory Group.

The consolidation of the functions of several bodies into Departments:

Australian Customs and Border Protection Service into the Department of  Immigration and Border Protection, to form a single operational border group;  The functions of Health Workforce Australia, the General Practice Education and  Training Limited and the Australian National Preventative Health Agency into the  Department of Health;  Grape and Wine Research and Development Selection Committee and Wine Australia  Corporation Selection Committee into the Department of Agriculture; and  Telecommunications Universal Service Management Agency into the Department of  Communications.

The merger of government bodies including:

The merger of ComSuper into the Commonwealth Superannuation Corporation;  The merger of five civilian merit review tribunals into a single organisation including:  o the Administrative Appeals Tribunal  o the Classification Review Board

o the Migration Review Tribunal  o the Refugee Review Tribunal, and  o the Social Security Appeals Tribunal;  The merger of back-office functions of seven Canberra-based cultural collection  institutions and archival institutions:

o the National Archives  o the National Film and Sound Archive  o the National Gallery

o the National Library  o the National Museum  o the National Portrait Gallery, and  o Old Parliament House);  The merger of different functions of the Office of the Australian Information

Commissioner into the Australian Human Rights Commission, the Administrative  Appeals Tribunal, the Commonwealth Ombudsman and the Attorney-General's  Department  The merger of some of the Private Health Insurance Administration Council functions

into the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and all other functions  into the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority  The merger of the Private Health Insurance Industry Ombudsman into the Office of

the Commonwealth Ombudsman  The merger of the AQUAPLAN Working Group into the Aquaculture Committee;  The merger of the Australian Weeds Committee, Biosafety and Biosecurity Working  Group and the Established Pests and Diseases Working Group into the National  Biosecurity Committee;  The merger of the National Competition Council Secretariat into the Australian  Competition and Consumer Commission  The merger of the National Blood Authority with the Australian Organ and Tissue  Donation and Transplantation Authority.

Other key reforms to reduce the size of government and improve the efficiency of  government services will be pursued in consultation with the States and Territories in the  health portfolio.

Subject to this consultation, one single body - a new Health Productivity and Performance  Commission would perform the functions currently provided by six different bodies, all with  their own corporate structures:

o The Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care;  o The Independent Hospitals Pricing Authority;  o The National Health Funding Body;  o The National Health Funding Pool Administrator;  o The National Health Performance Authority; and  o The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare

The Government will not proceed with the establishment of two new bodies which the former  Government sought to establish and fund in 201 3:

o The Student Identifiers Agency;  o The Brisbane Cross River Rail and Melbourne Metro Projects Advisory Board.

The Government will conduct scoping studies into the possible privatisation of several  government bodies:

o Defence Housing Australia  o the Royal Australian Mint  o Australian Hearing  o the Registry function of ASIC

Total general public service expenses are estimated to decrease by 33.6 per cent in real terms  from 201 3-14 to 2014- 1 5 and decrease by 7.5 per cent in real terms over the period 201 4- 15  to 2017-18.

These savings are necessary so that the Government can repair the Budget and strengthen  Australia's future.

The Government will also pursue asset reductions within agencies through the progressive  sale of a number of surplus properties.

The Government will achieve M h e r  efficiencies through implementing a Contestability  Framework to methodically assess whether particular government functions should be open  to competition and how competition should occur. This will allow competing providers to  come from both inside and outside of government.

Over the next three years government functions will be systematically reviewed to determine  if they are, in whole or in part, appropriate for competition or whether they should continue to  be performed exclusively by government.

The third and most comprehensive phase of consolidation in the number of government  bodies will be considered by government in time for inclusion in the MYEFO 20 14- 15.

A particular focus of this next stage will be to reduce the number of small agencies, which  carry disproportionate and wasteful overheads.

To support better decision-making and limit the creation of new government bodies in the  future, an Australian Government Governance Policy will be released later in 2014. It will  have a particular focus on preventing the past proliferation of wasteful structures in the future  and ensure government bodies operate as efficiently as possible.
