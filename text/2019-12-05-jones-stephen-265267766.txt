E&OE TRANSCRIPT  TELEVISION INTERVIEW  SKY NEWS AM AGENDA  THURSDAY, 5 DECEMBER 2019

SUBJECTS: MedEvac; Public Sector cuts; Angus Taylor; The Nationals Hunger  Games.

KIERAN GILBERT: Let's go now to Stephen Jones, the Shadow Assistant Treasurer.  What's your view now, what's Labor’s view on the prospect of a lifetime ban for refugees  who are resettled in New Zealand to come to Australia? Because that's been the stumbling  block for the Government in taking up that offer, which Jacinta Ardern has reiterated this  morning, is still there.

STEPHEN JONES: If there is a secret deal on the table, and this is a part of it, let's have an  open debate about it. There's no public interest in keeping this sort of thing private and  covered up. If we can get those people off Manus and Nauru to New Zealand, that's got to  be a good thing. Labor would support it. To your question about a lifetime ban - this never  ever, ever proposition - I’ll give you a couple of examples why I think it's impractical. Let's  just say there's kids there. Let’s say one of those five year olds at the age of 18 goes to  New Zealand at the age of 18, joins the New Zealand Defence Force, and is involved in a  joint operation with the Australian Defence Force. Is that guy excluded? Let's say one of  them joins the New Zealand National Party and becomes a Minister in the New Zealand  Parliament. Is that guy excluded from coming to Australia? Let’s say they're the Trade  Minister. Are they excluded from coming to Australia? We're talking about forever and ever  and ever sort of arrangement. I think that's a little bit silly, to be honest. Let's come to a  practical, pragmatic solution. If we can get those people off those islands and into New  Zealand, that'll be a great outcome.

ANNELISE NIELSEN: The argument of the Government is in those situations that would  be at the discretion of the Minister. You can make a special application. It's similar to what  we have with other countries. So why should this be treated any differently?

JONES: This is my view, and you've just put it to me where this stuff is just unfolding as it  comes. I'm not talking on behalf of the Labor Shadow Ministry or the Labor Shadow Cabinet  on this. But my view is - let’s take a pragmatic approach and get those people off those  islands and deal with some of these complicated cases as they arise.

GILBERT: That that certainly makes sense, because I think the government certainly very  keen to have it resolved for a number of reasons. Peter Dutton, he himself, was the one  who got all the children off Nauru.

JONES: That's not quite true. There are still kids there. He says that it's not true. what there  are teams of those. There have been kids there since he made those statements on Manus  and Nauru.

GILBERT: They're adamant that all the kids have been removed. The fact is the  Government does want a humanitarian outcome.

JONES: I'm not trying to pick points. We want those kids off those island happened to and  if we can get them to New Zealand  and we can get a pragmatic arrangement around that I  think that'll be a good outcome.

GILBERT: I guess for Labor it will be nice to just move on from this issue because it's been  a devastating one for years.

JONES: The politics of it are toxic and the humanity gets left out when the politics gets  injected into it and that's a bad thing for Australia and a bad thing for the people on Nauru.

NIELSEN: Now when it comes to this public service consolidation 18 departments down to  14. It does seem like he's trying to get the most out of the resources he has there, even if  they say no layoffs. What do you make of today's announcement?

JONES: I don't accept there won't be layoffs. There always are. Here’s the injustice in it all:  Five departmental secretaries have been sacked today but Angus Taylor still keeps his job.  A lot of people have got to be saying: where's the justice in that? These five departmental  secretaries, amongst them is Mike Mrdak, a highly esteemed public servant who was  brought into the Communications Department to clean up the mess that Mitch Fifield made  and did a good job of that. He's been sacked today and four others amongst him. But  Angus Taylor, who has been completely incompetent, probably the most incompetent  Minister on Scott Morrison's front bench, keeps his job. The Prime Minister should sack him  today and save himself the loss of credibility he is getting by maintaining Angus on the front  bench.

GILBERT: Do you accept the Prime Minister's assurance that this is not about trying to cut  costs beyond those secretaries who have lost their jobs? That it's not about a job cutting  exercise?

JONES: You have to accept that, as generally those sort of mergers cost the taxpayer  money. There's actually a lot of money involved in bringing departments together. I'm not  just talking about new stationery and new letterhead, there's a lot of transaction costs. It  generally costs a lot more than any of the savings that are realised over the medium term.  Yes, he's just stating the obvious when he says it's not about cost cuts. The real test of  whether it's effective or not is whether a pensioner who is applying for a pension can get it  approved inside six months, which is the average wait time now, or somebody applying on  the NDIS for a new plan or a new wheelchair can wait up to five months. Is that happening  quicker? That's got to be the real test. One thing that I'm a little bit concerned about with  this new mega-departments is that's got agriculture, water and  the environment in it. Does



that mean the National Party is now in charge of environment policy in this country?

NIELSEN: Susan Ley is staying on this Environment Minister, he said in the press  conference.

JONES: But she will be reporting to the head of that department. Under the secret Coalition  agreement, we think that job is reserved for a National Party cabinet minister. That's a little  bit worrying given their track record on environmental matters.

NIELSEN: It does make sense to have water in with agriculture and environment because it  is an important part of the environment. They're quite interlinked.

JONES: I absolutely agree that you can't deal with water issues without considering the  environmental issues, that we've got to ensure that our agriculture is done in a long-term,  sustainable way. My single point here is that the National Party, which has got a lock on  that job, have got an appalling record in this area.

GILBERT: The Nationals already, from what I've heard since that announcement, are  wanting to be reassured that they'll still have their three senior ministers of the 14  departments, given the way the Coalition agreement is done.

JONES: Let The Hunger Games begin.
