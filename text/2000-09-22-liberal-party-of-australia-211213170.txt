DIPLOMATIC APPOINTMENT: AMBASSADfOR TO THAILAND

I have today announced the appointment of Mr Miles Kupa as Australia’s Ambassador to the   Kingdom of Thailand.

Mr Kupa will replace Mr William Fisher, who has been Ambassador since December 1997.   He is expected to take up his appointment in November 2000.

Australia’s relations with Thailand are at a high point. The bilateral relationship spans trade   and investment, defence, education, narcotics control, tourism, cooperation on foreign policy   and refugee issues and aid. While relations have always been cordial, recent events have   generated considerable goodwill and positioned Australia firmly in Thai minds as a reliable   friend and partn~er. These events include Australia’s contribution in 1997 of US$l billion to   the IMF package put together ffor Thailand to deal with the economic crisis; the Prime   Minister’s visit to Thailand in April 1998 and his announcement of further aid to help   Thailand weather the storms of the economic crisis; and. Australia’s strong support for

Thailand’s candidate for the WTO Director General position. The bilateral relationship was   also strengthened by cooperation over East Timor and by recent exchanges on regional   security. Thailand’s economic recovery provides opportunities for still closer economic links.

He has already served twice in Thailand - on his first posting and   as Deputy Head1 of Mission from 198283.

Philippines (as Ambassador, 1996-99).
