SENATOR THE HON PENNY WONG  LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION IN THE SENATE  SHADOW MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS  LABOR SENATOR FOR SOUTH AUSTRALIA



UN SECRETARY-GENERAL



Labor congratulates Antonio Guterres on being nominated by the UN Security  Council to be the 9th United Nations Secretary-General.

The former Prime Minister of Portugal, UN Commissioner for Refugees and  European Council President is well qualified to serve as head of the United Nations  at this crucial time.

As Prime Minister of Portugal Mr Guterres helped lead the campaign for international  intervention to halt the violence in East Timor following the Timorese vote for  independence.

His time heading the UNHCR was marked by the largest movement of people  seeking asylum since the end of the Second World War, making him well qualified to  tackle an issue that will continue to dominate international relations.

Mr Guterres’ election was assisted by his nomination having the full backing of  Portugal’s Prime Minister.

Unfortunately, Malcolm Turnbull was unable to put aside petty partisan politics and  follow this lead by supporting an Australian nomination for this prestigious role.

Mr Turnbull’s refusal to nominate Kevin Rudd, a former Prime Minister and Foreign  Minister, contrary to his own Foreign Minister’s recommendation, shows he puts the  demands of the Liberal Party’s hard right ahead of Australia’s national interest.
