Greetings omitted.

PRESENTER:

…You can see here, I’ve got the black and white number, MG’s got the coloured number and we’ve brought  Doctor Dan back, 30 years, Triple M, we’ve got a t-shirt here for you. Now, I know you’re all dressed up in  your suit and stuff there, but it’d probably be great if you could just whack that on and then you can be an  absolute Grilla! You can be a member of The Grill Team, mate. That is the brand new exclusive Doctor Dan  t-shirt.

TONY ABBOTT:

Mate, but look, this doesn’t go with my red budgie smugglers. You know, how can I wear this?

PRESENTER:

That’s a good point, actually. Maybe when you’re training at the 155 Gym at Rooty Hill tomorrow night,  before your little stoush with Ms Gillard, you know, you could put that shirt on for you training.

TONY ABBOTT:

Not a bad thought and then I can go to Minchin’s Restaurant there!

PRESENTER:

I tell you what, they do a good chicken schnitzel.

TONY ABBOTT:

Do they now? Fantastic.

PRESENTER:

Yep, extra chips if you ask for them as well, mate. Mate, you’re on the campaign trail now, you’re at Rooty  Hill, right in the heartland of Triple M and the west tomorrow, you’ve got an hour and then the PM’s got an  hour. What can people expect mate, because I think what we’d really like is both of you to get up there  together and have a bit of a proper stoush.

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, I think there’ll be plenty of good discussion and as far as I’m concerned, I’m trying to save Australia  from a very bad government. It’s been a very bad government, we know that the New South Wales Labor  Party in particular couldn’t organise a booze up in a brewery and Federal Labor’s just as bad, because  Federal Labor has been effectively taken over by State Labor, that was the execution of Kevin Rudd, it was  basically about the New South Wales Labor mafia, taking over the national government.

PRESENTER:

Tone, I’m from Penrith. I live and breathe Penrith and it seems to be that we are often and people from  Mount Druitt and the western Sydney are often considered second class citizens in a lot of ways and I think,  yesterday I read a bit of a press release that said you went up to Townsville last week announcing $21  million to upgrade a flood prone main road up there, but not once have I heard in any election from either  side, any money that would be put on any of the arteries coming in from the west to the city.

TONY ABBOTT:

Yeah, look, Mark, I hear what you’re saying. I mean, the best thing I can do for the people of western  Sydney, just like the best thing I can do for people everywhere, is to give us a good government and I don’t  actually like the idea of turning up in place after place like Santa Claus, giving gifts from his sack, but the  truth is, Coalition Government’s have delivered for western Sydney, the last decent bit of infrastructure in  western Sydney was the M7 orbital and that was done with a lot of money from the Federal Government, in  fact, John Howard opened it in 2007.

PRESENTER:

Most of our listeners are now listening to this interview stuck in traffic on the way in from the west. What  kind of ray of sunshine can you give them?

TONY ABBOTT:

Mate, if we can get rid of the debt and deficit, then we can start building the infrastructure that we need, but  when you’ve got a government that wastes money on overpriced school halls, when you’ve got a  government which wastes money putting pink batts in rooves which then catch fire, it’s very hard to spend  the money that we need to spend on better roads and better trains.

PRESENTER:

I saw your speech on Sunday and so did MG, because he had to sit there and wait while the Sunday Roast  was waiting for you to do your big speech and you ticked all the boxes, you whacked Julia Gillard over the  head, but as I was listening and, you know, getting all the big ruckus applause, I thought what is there to  inspire me as an Australian, because I found it, and the other side has been very much the same, negative,  negative, negative, what is there to inspire me? You see, you know, in America, you get these sort of, great  flowing speeches where we’re going to do this and do that. What was there to inspire me, Tony?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think we are a great country with a great people, but we’ve got government which gets in our way. Now, I  think if we can get a better government, a government which works with people rather than against people,  then we will be the country that we can be.

PRESENTER:

What does that mean?

TONY ABBOTT:

It means that if you don’t do things like rip off people with these pink batts, rip off people with these school  halls, then the money can go to good things. Now, you know, we all know that you give the money to the  parents and the principals, they know what’s best for there schools and I’ve been to school after school  around Australia and people have spoken to me with tears in their eyes, about the waste that’s gone on  because they don’t want their school to be a poster for government waste and yet that’s the sort of thing  that’s happened with Julia Gillard and this school hall rip off programme?

[ad break]

PRESENTER:

And we’re back live in the studio with the man that may well be Australia’s next Prime Minister, Tony  Abbott, is live with your questions. Gus, you have a listener question for Tony?

PRESENTER:

I sure do. Labor has jumped on reports there’s big hole in the Coalition’s bottom line. Treasury documents  have revealed the savings from scrapping the National Broadband Network will total $1.6 billion, not the  $2.44 billion initially thought. Can you give us your comments on that?

TONY ABBOTT:

I’d be very sceptical about so-called secret Treasury documents. I mean, no one’s seen this thing and this  coming from a Government which couldn’t get its mining tax figures right so, look, we’re very confident.  We think our figures absolutely stack up.

PRESENTER:

We’ve got a commercial here to play for you, Mr Abbott.

[plays ALP WorkChoices ad]

Now, it’s a big one in western Sydney and Will from Rosehill wants to know if Mr Abbott will bring back  WorkChoices.

TONY ABBOTT:

Absolutely not and Will, don’t believe the Labor Party’s lies.

PRESENTER:

You hear at that little grab then, Tone, about, there’s a lot of scaremongering I suppose between each Party.  I’ve often wondered, I don’t know how much you spend on your election campaign trail through the media?  I’d love one day for a politician to say, ‘you know what? I want to back myself and my policies without

4

even trying to go through the media. I can stand by…all my money that I’m going to spend from taxpayers  on the election campaign, I’m going to put that into hospitals.’

TONY ABBOTT:

Mark, it’s a good thought but the fact is you’ve got to get your message out there and the problem we’ve got  is that Labor normally outspends us by at least two to one because we’re fighting, not just the Labor Party,  we’re fighting the union movement.

PRESENTER:

And the Greens.

TONY ABBOTT:

Mostly the union movement because every year the union movement collects about a billion dollars in fees  off people and this is essentially a campaigning army for the Labor Party. One of the reasons why it’s not a  level playing field anymore. The union movement stacks the deck against the Coalition.

PRESENTER:

I want to get to the boats, but I want to quickly as you: you’re the beneficiary at the moment of what’s going  on with Rudd and Latham, runaways trains on the other side. If you had to handle them, if the shoe was on  the other foot, how would you handle Rudd and Latham?

TONY ABBOTT:

Luckily I don’t have to.

PRESENTER:

I’ve got an old pair of footy boots in my bag…

TONY ABBOTT:

But look, it’s been a shambolic Government. It’s run a shambolic campaign and since they got rid of Rudd,  things have just got worse and this idea that the guy who was a pariah six weeks ago now has to be the  Messiah for the campaign, he’s gone from zero to hero so to speak, and I just think it shows what kind of  disarray they’re in.

PRESENTER:

And we have a quick one from the newsroom. Sami Lukis in the newsroom has one for you Tony.

PRESENTER:

Mr Abbott, there’s a story this morning that Australia has one of the highest rates of alcohol abuse in the  world. Particularly disturbing for Aussie men. How would the Coalition address this issue?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, basically by saying to people we should try to avoid unhealthy use of alcohol. I mean, what both sides  of politics have done is try to bring public education into play and try to set a good example and I guess  we’ve just got to keep beavering away here. There’s no magic answer. But the former Coalition Government

5

put a lot of money into responsible use of alcohol campaigns and that’s something that we’d continue.

PRESENTER:

Didn’t I spot you having a little bevvie at the Ekka in Brissie the other day?

TONY ABBOTT:

You did and the interesting thing is that I had about a quarter of the glass and then I thought hang on a  minute, I’ve got a press conference to do this afternoon. If the press conference goes badly I want it to by  my fault, not the fault of what I’ve drunk, so I stopped there.

PRESENTER:

Now, have we got that commercial there, from Mr Abbott on the boats?

Plays Real Action recording.

PRESENTER:

Now, the boat issue is something you’ve been hard on, but so have the other side. Isn’t it true that 98 per  cent of refugees and illegal immigrants come on the plane anyway? Isn’t the boat issue, don’t we just blow  this up to a far bigger issue than it really is?

TONY ABBOTT:

But no one dies coming to Australia on a plane. That’s the problem when they come to Australia in a boat.  They come without papers, they come completely unannounced and tragically some die on the way. So  that’s why the boat thing is qualitatively different and worse than the plane thing.

PRESENTER:

Just off the air before our interview I asked you how the whole campaign trail was going and you said it was  kind of like three NRL games back to back to back.

TONY ABBOTT:

Every day.

PRESENTER:

Every day. So what is your set play? What’s your game breaker that’s going to score the winning try in this  election?

TONY ABBOTT:

You just keep taking the ball up. Just keep taking the ball up.

PRESENTER:

No chip over the top, you know, the winger or something?

TONY ABBOTT:

6

Yeah, look, occasionally, but I leave the flash stuff to the other people. I just keep taking the ball up, that’s  all I do.

PRESENTER:

Tony, best of luck. Thanks for coming in on The Grill Team, mate, and thanks for taking our listeners  answers, questions sorry. There was a million of them. We wish we could have more time with you. But  thanks for coming in, mate.

TONY ABBOTT:

Great to be here. Thanks.
