TRANSCRIPT OF RADIO INTERVIEW  DR JOHN HEWSON MP - LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION  AND JEFF JAY, RADIO 2HD, NEWCASTLE

E S- OE - PROOF COPY ONLY TRANSCR\T0004:MM

Jay:

... different circumstances to last time. We were sitting in  a shopping centre twelve months ago, just about to the day, I  might remind you.

Hewson:

Yes, that's right.

Jay:

At Jesmond, talking about things and I think magazine covers  were the issue at- that stage, and things have certainly moved  along since then for you.

Hewson:

They have, yes.

J a y :

Do you feel more confident as an Opposition Leader, perhaps as  a future Prime Minister, than you did twelve months ago?

Hewson:

Well, we think we'll win. but we're not complacent. We're  putting in eighteen hours a day, seven days a week, to make  sure we win.

Jay:

Well,  you're welcomed in to, I guess,  to the studio with the  news this morning that the Australian dollar is at its lowest  level for five years, around about 70 point, or just about,  anyway, 70, just over the 70 mark. How do you take that news?

Hewson:

Well, its an interpretation of the financial markets and the  Budget. I think that financial markets have recognised that  the Budget was grossly irresponsible, spending billions of  dollars the Government doesn't have on top of a huge debt.

Jay:

Is it really...

Hewson:

...only a matter of time.

Jay:

Is it really that or is it that it's just now starting to  catch up with some of the other currencies around the world,  particularly European countries?

Hewson:

No, there's a bit of movement in the US dollar in recent days,  but the judgement is always made on the basis of the

relativities, and our currency is still falling relative to  most. Bo my view is that the financial markets have started  to do their sums. The Government was very, they brought down,  as I say, an irresponsible Budget and if you add up the

deficit from last year through to the middle of the decade  that they've told us about, it's $50 billion they don't have.

Jay:

Yet we have people saying, listen, we needed the dollar to  drop anyway and some of the exporters are going to welcome the  drop.

Hewson:

Sure, we all want a lower dollar. We always want a more

competitive exchange rate but there are ways to get it and the  best way to get it is to put the right policies in place.  Right now there's a very real risk that this dollar fall will  feed through into inflation and we'll have a rekindling of

inflation.

I was told in early 1985 I was mad when I said that and the  inflation almost doubled from 5 to nearly 10 per cent in the  course of calendar 1985. I'm not saying the same magnitude of  price effect is there, but there's still a price effect,

inflation is on the way up.

Jay:

How far can the dollar go without being a real concern for us?

Hewson:

Well, I think it's a warning, it's a fairly consistent warning  now, that the Government really ought to put in place a set of  policies that will deal with our problems, not worry about  their political survival. And I think most international

markets have been sitting back and waiting to see whether the  Government really had the courage to put the policies in place  or not, and they clearly haven't had.

Jay:

Well you know, you and I know that nothing is going to change  other than what's been put in place now, so it's a matter of  the Government's running with what they've got and we know  fairly well where you stand on most issues through your

Fightbacki package, so it's now down to the wire with what is  being presented by both sides, I guess.

Hewson:

Yes, well we set out a bit over two years ago to make sure  that the electorate had a very clear choice. There are  fundamental differences between us in almost every policy area  and I've spent most of the last two and a half years making  sure people understood the magnitude of the difference. So  there'll be a first, for the first election in a long time

there will be a very clear choice between the two parties.

Jay:

Right, let's run through some of those issues as quickly as we  can with the limited time that we have. I must ask you first,  though, as you're driving into an area like this, there's two  sides to it, isn't it, there's a fairly strong Labor hold, as  there has been for a number of years and yet you're going, or  you're here for a seat like Paterson which is going to be,  well, with all we've got available to us, a pretty tightly

contested seat.

Hewson:

Very tight.

4

Jay:

What have* your advisers told you about Paterson? What do you  know about it?

Hewson:

I think it’s certainly a winnable seat.  This whole area, I  guess, has been subject to a lot of shocks over and above the  recession in recent years and yet its an area that has

tremendous potential.  And I personally think tourism and the  wine industry and its related activities are two of those  really leading lights, as far as this area is concerned and I  think it's got enormous potential.  But we just came across

from the RAAF Base to your station, across the so-called  "tourist road" and, you know, it's unbelievably bad for a road  that is so important to those types of industries in this  area.  So the feeling you get is one of enormous potential,   but still a way to go in order to be in a position to capture

it.

Jay:

Alright,  so how do you feel as you come into an area which is  considered Labor's heartland? I mean, that terminology was  used by the former Prime Minister.

Hewson:

Well, I think that it's a bit simplistic these days to think  of Labor having a heartland.  You can hardly call them a Labor  Government when they've created one million unemployed and I  think there are a lot of Australians, many of them traditional

Labor voters, who feel a bit,  feel like outsiders,  really, in  their own system. They are not really part of the system any  more.  The system doesn't run to their benefit.  They've  either lost their job,  or if they’ve kept their job they've

seen their living standards fall. So I'm sure they're very  concerned that a Labor Government has not looked after the  interests of just average working Australians.

Jay:

I mentioned the former Prime Minister.  One of his suggestions  was, or the way he observed the current situation, was that if  you got rid of the GST you're home and hosed at the next

election,  absolutely.  All the other factors in the Fightback!   package he thought was quite OK but GST could be what brings  you down.

5

Yes, strange comment from a man who advocated it in 1985, and  if it was important then, it's even more important now. Look,  we're not. just about winning elections. We're trying to put  in place the right policies and if people don't like that they

can vote against us. They can have the other crowd. They can  have more of the same, but we're going to solve the problems.

Jay:

But you've got to be there to put the policies in, don't you?

Hewson:

We're only going to get there if we can convince people that  it's time for major change in Australia and that part of that  change is tax reform. It's only part of it. I mean,

industrial relations reform is a bigger reform. But it is a  package. It was a package that was put together without any  politics, just taking the best advice as to what should be  done to solve our problems and we are presenting people with a

real choice. You want the problems solved, you vote for us.  If you don't, if you want more of the same, the same sort of  recession and policy mismanagement that you've seen in the  last five to ten years, then vote for the other side. It's a  clear choice we're giving people.

Jay:

Well, we've got somebody that wants to ask about enterprise  bargaining, so I'll leave the industrial relations side alone  for a moment because that's obviously an important one, I'll  come to that. Have you any thoughts, though, about changing

any particular elements of the GST, particularly down the  lower end. I see that's where the problem area is going to be  because it's such a fine line.

Hewson:

No, I mean the package puts about $30 to $40 per week back in  the pockets of people over and above the tax. I mean, if we  can't win giving people $30 to $40 a week back in their

pockets, you know, we've really got a problem and as far as I  can see, we just have to argue that case better. The system  has been designed very carefully. It's considered by the  experts to potentially be the best in the world, and the

fairest in the world. We have a Committee, the Cole

Committee, which has taken well ov^r three hundred submissions  from various groups arguing about the detail and how the tax  might impact on particular industries or particular  activities, and we'll be making a major statement about that.  But we won't be changing any of the essentials of the package.

Hewson:

6

Jay:

You said about getting your message across. Obviously that's  critical for any Party, Government or Opposition, to do that,  it was interesting a poll conducted which showed that people  were pretty disenchanted with what the Government dished up in

their Budget. By the same token, 43 per cent of those people  believed that the Opposition wouldn't have dished up anything  better. Do see there's still, there’s cynicism that’s running

through the middle area at the moment?

Hewson:

Yes, there's great disenchantment with politicians and why  shouldn't there be. I mean, they've been promising things for  years that they can never deliver. And I'm not going to raise  expectations falsely, I'm just going to say I'm going to solve

the problems. You want the problems solved, vote for us.

Jay:

Alright, so what do we do about the unemployment as it stands  at the moment? What would you do immediately?

Hewson:

Well, there's plenty you can do from "day one". Things like  freezing the Superannuation Guarantee Levy will save about  another Â£10,000 to 100,000 jobs and we're seeing the effect of  that already. No more national wage cases will save jobs.  Cuts in immigration will save jobs. Cutting payroll tax,  eliminating payroll tax, will create 200,000 jobs. Getting

the Government fiscal accounts in order and lower interest  rates and so on will feed through to more jobs, cutting  business costs across the board as we abolish excise tax and  sales tax, in fact, seven business taxes, cut business costs,  business taxes by $20 billion plus reducing the costs of  waterfront and transport and telecommunications. And it's

possible to create jobs reasonably quickly and we will put all  the relevant legislation for that type of package in place in  the early ...(inaudible)...

Jay:

...reasonably quickly, that's the crux of it, isn't it.  Reasonably quickly, because ...

7

... well, we've just lost three years while the Government has  fiddled around. You know, I mean we're moving off a very  difficult base. But look, some things, freezing the

superannuation levy will start saving jobs from "day one".  We've had people in my own office whose kids have been either  laid off or reduced from full-time to part-time in order for  the employer, a major employer, to accommodate that. I mean,

there's an affect that could have been avoided, could be  reversed,, if you just take that decision on "day one". So  there's a lot you can do from "day one.".

Jay:

So you wouldn't have come at this handing out to the councils.  I've already heard you say that. That wouldn't have been the  go. But you're not going to be able to turn that around now  given that an election is probably not coming till next year

and they've got to get that in place before December, anyway.

Hewson:

Well, they're going to try and push it through. What we've  said is that obviously a lot of councils around Australia have  quite legitimate projects which they would want looked at, and  we'd look at those on their merits. But if it's just a

"Mickey Mouse" job creation scheme giving people shovels or  going them some white paint to go and paint some rocks, we  wouldn't support it because it doesn't create real jobs. It’s  much better for us to put the $100 million that we've

allocated into training through voluntary agencies to give  people a bit of training, to get them back on the job, or put  in place the youth wage. I mean, there's a policy that would

take effect from "day one",

A minimum youth training wage would employ young people  immediately and we've seen people around Australia, there's a  jeweller in Queanbeyan who actually advertised on the basis of  the youth training wage and appointed eleven people and the  unions are apparently stepping in to block the jobs. Now, it

proves the point, you can create jobs almost immediately. And  in fact, if you look at it, there are 750,000 small businesses  and farms in Australia, about 160,000 young people looking for  jobs. If less than 25 per cent of the small businesses took  on one person each you'd have no youth unemployment.

Jay:

Yes, I've had that line thrown at me a few times in the last  couple of weeks and I understand that the maths are there.

Hewson:

8

Hewson:

You can see the small business.  we've had dozens and dozens  of examples come into my office of people who would hire.

Jay:

Right, there are people who want to talk, but I must ask you,  let’s clarify what John Howard said last night.  Immigration,  it seems to be some confusion reading reports this morning and  hearing what he said.

Hewson:

No, a bit of media confusion.  I mean, John's views on

immigration have been known for a long time. I've called for  a significant, dramatic and immediate cut in immigration, so  has Philip Ruddock.  I don't think anybody is saying anything  different.

Jay:

Yes, but, give us the figures.  I mean he said 50,000 wasn't  enough and then it was suggested, well,  the Government's going  to bring it down to a growth of around 80,000 there anyway.

Hewson:

Add back the 30,000 Chinese students, about 100,000, the  Government.  Look,  I've said in comparable periods of  recession in the past we've seen immigration fall to 50Â­  70,000. We haven't put a firm number on it and I'm not sure

that we will because Philip Ruddock has done a lot of work  demonstrating how, when you target a specific outcome, you  undermine the integrity of the system. We’ve see a lot of  evidence in recent days of the Government just trying to

achieve numbers rather than worrying about the type of  immigrant that we're getting and whether they will fit in.  And when you've got,  what,  40-odd per cent of recently arrived  migrants on some sort of Government benefit, you've got to ask

yourself whether you've been doing a very good job for them or  for the country.  Â·

Jay:

But even those people may support you on that Dr Hewson.   Surely they're going to say, well, if you've said 50,000, a  cut of 50,000 is not enough, give us some idea where you think  it must be enough.  I mean if 50,000s not enough, you must  have a figure in mind, surely?

9

No we haven't, because there are humanitarian needs which, we  have a very large backlog, for example, of refugees who are  having their status determined, or potential refugees having  their status determined. Now we don't know how many of those  will end up coming in as immigrants. So there's one big  question mark, if you like. I think we must have about 20,000

or more in that queue at the present time.

J a y :

How do we know 50,000 is not enough, then.

Hewson:

Well, you've got to make a judgement on the basis of the  labour market at the time and, look, there are a lot of

factors that you would need to take into account to put a  specific number on it and we actually don't have all the  information one would need to do that properly. We don't know  what's in the pipeline.

Jay:

Well, why can you say, though, that 50,000 the Government has  suggested is not enough?

Hewson: .

No, sorry, the Government has talked about 80,000 which is  really 100,000 and I've said that isn't enough. Tn similar  circumstances ...(interruption),., to put that in context in  similar circumstances in the past, the number has fallen to  between 50 and 75,000. The other thing is that there are a

lot of people leaving Australia, by choice, so what numbers  are we talking about. I mean, you don't have a handle on that  either until after the event, so that aiming for a particular  number can be a hazardous exercise. X would have thought that

past experience as a guide to the. sort of orders of magnitude.  It's significantly below the Government, upwards of 50,000,  below the Government. I would have thought that that was a  pretty clear-cut statement.

Jay:

Can I ask that we just take a couple of calls before you go  because we have a full board of callers and rather than  deprive them totally, as much as I've got many questions I'd  love to ask. Joan, good morning.

Hewson:

10

Joan:

Oh, good morning.  I wanted to ask what the pension

compensation in dollars and cents would be for the age  pension.

Hewson:

It's $24 a fortnight.

Joan:

...every fortnight...

Hewson:

... for a single pensioner, yes, plus ...

Joan:

... this is a married pensioner ...

Hewson:

...plus access to private health insurance. If the family  income, pension income,  is below $ 1 4 , 5 0 0 .

Joan:

...well, we're basic pensioners.

Hewson:

Yes, you'd get an $800 a year tax rebate which basically  covers the cost of private health insurance and would give you  access to a private bed in a public hospital or to a private  hospital and doctor of your choice. And there's some

compensation for the decline in the value of your savings.  It's up to $ 5 , 0 0 0  for a family, that's a one-off cheque from  the Government,  up to $ 5 , 0 0 0  per family to compensate for any  fall in the value of your savings. There are over and above  that a number of other specific things.  If you pay tax,  you'd  get the benefits of some tax cuts.

Joan:

No, we don't pay tax.

Hewson:

So, all up, we are convinced that pensioners will be

significantly better off.  Full pensioners,  as in your case,   would be significantly better off.

11

Joan:

What is the married rate per fortnight?

Hewson:

Look, I'm not sure, I'd have to go and look that up. I think  it's 8 per cent increase, if you ] ike, in the pension.

Joan:

...per cent of what, though?

Hewson:

Of your weekly pension.

Jay:

Of what you're earning now, what you're getting now.

Joan:

That's what I thought it would be.

Hewson:

It's 8 per cent.

Joan:

Well, it $24 for single.

Jay:

Single, that's right. Let me ask you quickly, Joan, what's  your gut feel about the Fightback! package, GST.

Joan:

I wrote to you last year and you sent me a copy, which I

couldn't figure out very much.  But I prefer your policies.  But of course I had to try and find out whether we would live  or starve with a GST.

Jay: .

You hit the nail on the head, that I made mention ago and I  think that's the area where the sell job has got to be done as  far as you're obviously concerned.

12

That's right. We've actually made a conscious effort to make  sure that you'll be better off and, in fact,  since I wrote to  you last year,  I ’m not sure when that was, but we have

recently released a package that gives a lot more detail for  older Australians and if you like to leave you address with  the radio station I'll make sure you get one of those

packages. .

Jay:

Right,  stay there Joan.  So we'll give an opportunity to as  many as we can.  John, you want to talk on Fightback! Hello  John. OK John's not with us. John, yes mate..

John:

Hello, yes, I'm here.  I just wanted to ask Dr Hewson about,  I  just heard that lady on the air there, and he said that he was  going to give the pensioners access, $800 access to private  health fund, to private hospitals.  X hardly see how this is  going to cover the expense of a private hospital bed because,  you know,  most of the time even v i t h e private health funds

now, I know people who have gone in and they've had to pay a  couple of thousand dollars extra above the private health fund  rebates. So, you know,  $800 is, you know, it's a drop in the

ocean, that's not going to cover it and is he going to force  everyone into a private health fund and just dismantle Medibank?

Jay:

Are you going to keep the Medicare Levy at 1.4.

Hewson:

We're going to keep the levy at 1.25, we're not going to increase it. And secondly, you know, we are maintaining Medicare and improving Medicare for the aged, in particular,  they will be the beneficiaries of that.  The Government is

trying to run a bit of a scare campaign that we '  re going to  dismantle Medicare, what we're really doing is giving people  the choice by giving them tax incentives to take out private  health insurance.  Now,  you know, I think that's a benefit

over and above what's presently in the system and when you  combine that with some of the other changes we will make to  the system, particularly in relation to hospitals and hospital  costing, and industrial relations in hospitals, you can have a

significant improvement in the quality of health services and  in the cost of health services.

Hewson;

13

We actually, under our package,  because we exclude health  services from the Goods and Services Tax,  the cost of health  services will fall and that's been admitted by the Government  as well. So there's a lot going for people as a result of the  health package.

J a y ;

What about the $800. The gentleman suggested really that's  small peanuts compared to what.

Hewson:

Our advice is that that covers the cost of private health  insurance. Secondly, of course,  we're expanding the  competition in the provision of private health insurance to  include other major insurers.  That competition will also work  to lower the premiums on health insurance, and, of course, as  more and more people go into private insurance the risks are

spread over a greater number of people.

We think the costs of private health insurance will come down,  so we didn't do those numbers lightly. We did them very  carefully. I'm not sure of the particular hospital costs the  gentleman referred to over and above that,  if he wants to

leave some details we'll actually have a look at it in

relation to what did happen to that particular person to see  whether, you know, ... wouldn't or shouldn't have been

covered.

Jay:

What's the end result? is the end aim to eventually get rid  of the Medicare system, Medibank?

Hewson:

The end aim is to give people choice. And people are excluded  these days from making basi ^ choices,  choices at the  workplace, choices in education, choices in health, and the  emphasis is on choice and financial capability to exercise

that choice.

Jay:

You talk about choice, one of those I think, obviously you  mentioned industrial relations and Jill, we haven't got much  time, but you're talking about enterprise bargaining.

14

Jill:

Yes,  Dr Hewson, I want to ask you a quick question about an  article, page 45 in yesterday's Financial Review but I heard  your spirited reply to the Budget and I do understand that in  the case of places like SPC, where the workers co-operated,  they did help pull that company out of difficulties and were

subsequently rewarded. Nevertheless, Dr Hewson, on page 45 of  yesterday's Financial Review in New Zealand there's a general  perception the SOE structure has led to organisations that are  insensitive to the needs of their consumers and, Dr Hewson, it

is a fact, acknowledge in England that had Mrs Thatcher still  been there, where Mr Major is regarded as a very sensitive man  and really does care about the people he was returned, but  truly, had Mrs Thatcher still been there, there's no way she  would have, the Conservatives would have got back.

J a y :

You're suggestion what, that humanity has gone out of the  system by the introduction, in other words the exploitation  that sometime occur within the system. Is that the point of  it Jill? Well, she's not answering...

Hewson:

Well, the insensitivity couldn't be greater than having a  million people unemployed and people feeling outsiders in  their own country and that, you know, the Government talks a  lot about compassion, but there's nothing particularly

compassionate about 25 per cent interest rates and a million  unemployed.

Jay: x

I understand that, but the industrial relations side that  she's talking about, there has been some restructuring  occurring in the workplace, there is enterprise bargain  agreements, workplace bargain agreements that are going

through, the process may not be that quick, but at least it's  happening and if you've got the unions on side and the workers  on side in the long run it may work to the better.

Hewson:

Well, they're not, people don't have the choice, see, they  have to do it through a union, whereas in our system they'd  have the choice of doing it themselves or doing it through a  union, which is even more sensitive. I mean, it's giving

people choice. It's giving people the control over their  lives.

15

A very high percentage of people in recent surveys have wanted  the right, to negotiate directly with their employer. It's shown up in some major surveys published in the press in the  last few days, 60-odd per cent, I think 64 per cent in the

last survey I saw wanted the right to deal directly with their  employer. Union leadership is not acting in the best  interests of workers. Workers are paying union dues forcibly,  they're not getting any job security and they haven't had an

increase in their living standards, so they're justifiably  disenchanted with the union leadership. Their concept, the  Government's concept of enterprise bargaining is keeping  control of it, keeping tight control of the negotiations  within the union movement, within the centralised system,

having to have these agreements ticked off by the Industrial  Relations Commission, requiring unions to represent workers at  the workplace. Those sorts of constraints are not really

genuine enterprise bargaining. They are a more insensitive  way of dealing with wage negotiations than genuine workplace  negotiations between employers and employees.

Jay:

I think what Jill was focussing around to was the criticism  that, and I know the Government las directed that sort of  criticism, at you, that you're focussing, your economics are  focussed at the bottom line, sometimes there's not the room

for the compassion and ...

Hewson:

Well, it's always easy for the Government to say they're  compassionate when they're spending everyone else's money. I  mean, they don't have any monopoly of compassion and, as I  say, driving people out of their homes and businesses with  unbelievably high interest rates is not terribly

compassionate. I think giving people a welfare cheque when  they would prefer to have a job isn't very compassionate and  from my point of view, you know, I'm delighted to have the  debate with Paul Keating about compassion.

Jay:

When do you tip the election?

Hewson:

Well, we think they were planning to go October/November,  but  given that the Budget has died so quickly they might push it  out to next year now.

16

Jay:

Alright,  I've got to let you go. You've got to do a walk

around, I think,  at Greenhi1Is Shopping Centre and then  Chamber of Commerce at Maitland straight after that.

Hewson:

That's right, and then to the alumina smelter.

Jay:

Alright, I appreciate your time.

Hewson:

Thanks very much.

Jay:

The Leader of the Opposition, Dr John Hewson.

Ends...
