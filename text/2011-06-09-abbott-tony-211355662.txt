E&OE……………………….…………………………………………………………………

DAVID OLDFIELD:

Tony Abbott, the Opposition Leader has been good enough to make himself available this morning. Thanks  Tony. How are you?

TONY ABBOTT:

Good David. HowÃ¢ÂÂs yourself?

DAVID OLDFIELD:

Not too bad. Not too bad. Pleased to hear you are well. Look, when are you actually heading off to Nauru?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, the plan is to go on Saturday evening. I was hoping to go today but for all sorts of reasons that was  going to be difficult. WeÃ¢ÂÂve got a military funeral tomorrow and I think itÃ¢ÂÂs important that major party  leaders pay appropriate respects to our fallen soldiers.

DAVID OLDFIELD:

Absolutely. Yep.

TONY ABBOTT:

So look, I think the points you are making are all good ones but there is a very simple, straightforward way  to get third country processing of boat people arriving in Australia and that is use Nauru. It worked in the  past, it can work again in the future, it doesnÃ¢ÂÂt involve spending an additional $80 odd million building a  centre from scratch. It doesnÃ¢ÂÂt involve the risk of people being caned. It doesnÃ¢ÂÂt involve the necessity to take  4,000 people off another countryÃ¢ÂÂs hands. So itÃ¢ÂÂs absolutely the simple, straightforward way to go. The only  problem is this stubborn Prime Minister doesnÃ¢ÂÂt like the fact that John Howard thought of it first and if it

wasnÃ¢ÂÂt for the Prime MinisterÃ¢ÂÂs pride we wouldÃ¢ÂÂve done this about 12 months ago. Instead, weÃ¢ÂÂve gone  through this ridiculous, embarrassing, inept rigmarole of first East Timor, then Manus, now Malaysia and  frankly itÃ¢ÂÂs no wonder that members of the Labor caucus they are getting completely fed up with this kind of  pseudo-leadership from their Prime Minister.

DAVID OLDFIELD:

I mean, sadly, thatÃ¢ÂÂs really what it is, isnÃ¢ÂÂt it? It does seem to be the only explanation, the childishness thatÃ¢ÂÂs  attached to Labor and led by Julia Gillard, Wayne Swan, Bob Brown, whoever is leading them today, this  strange scenario, probably the most likely thing thatÃ¢ÂÂs stopping them from going to the obvious scenario of  Nauru would be that to do so would prove that everything that John Howard did in the first place when he  said “we will decide who comes to Australia and the circumstances under which they come”, everything he  said back then was right and theyÃ¢ÂÂve had it wrong every since.

TONY ABBOTT:

And the really bizarre thing is that what the Prime Minister is now proposing to do is vastly less humane  than the actions of the former government and yet the former government was attacked up hill and down  dale as being an absolute embarrassment to everything that was decent, true and good. So, Labor have got  themselves into a disastrous position because of the stubbornness and the pride and the folly of the Prime  Minister who IÃ¢ÂÂm afraid seems to have the Midas touch in reverse. Everything she does seems to fail.

DAVID OLDFIELD:

I had a good talk earlier in the week with The AustralianÃ¢ÂÂs foreign editor Greg Sheridan who would be well  known to you and he made it very clear, something I think a lot of us have suspected but you donÃ¢ÂÂt often  expect a journalist to say but he made it very clear with his 30 years experience in foreign affairs that he had  reached the view that basically coming to Australia by boat as weÃ¢ÂÂre seeing now is merely a form of illegal  immigration, very little of it has to do with being a refugee and that quite simply once people reach our  shoreline, given the circumstances of the way they are dealt with, they way our laws work, the access to all  forms of appeal, legal aid and everything else, ultimately even if they are probably not refugee there tends to  be an err in that direction, itÃ¢ÂÂs basically very hard to move them on. Of course, if they go to Nauru, thereÃ¢ÂÂll  actually be a much, much more specific and perhaps accurate assessment of their true circumstances?

TONY ABBOTT:

ThatÃ¢ÂÂs right, of the boat people sent to Nauru, about 30 per cent went back to their country of origin. About,  I think, 30 per cent went to countries other than Australia and ultimately about 40 per cent came to  Australia…

DAVID OLDFIELD:

Indeed those are the figures, yes.

TONY ABBOTT:

No guarantee that people when they are going to Nauru would come to Australia and this was why in  conjunction with temporary protection visas, even for those who did come to Australia, it was a very  powerful deterrent.

DAVID OLDFIELD:

ItÃ¢ÂÂs a sad fact, IÃ¢ÂÂm afraid, whilst you are going to go off to Nauru and I think thatÃ¢ÂÂs most timely and  appropriate because it does highlight how that situation will just work and has worked and indeed was a

great success, stopped the boats and also stopped people from simply being able to be accepted into  Australia regardless of their true status. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs great. But we both understand really, donÃ¢ÂÂt we, this is not  going to change without an election.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, thatÃ¢ÂÂs what we need David. I mean, weÃ¢ÂÂve got the Prime Minister who famously said, “there will be no  carbon tax under a government I lead”. She then said the day before the election, “I rule out a carbon tax”.  Wayne Swan said that claims that there will be a carbon tax if the government were re-elected were  “hysterical allegations”. Well, they turned out to be the absolute gospel truth and I think that people feel  incredibly ripped off because they should not be lied to be governments and certainly if government changes  its mind on something as important as this, it should go back to the people and seek a new mandate. So,  thatÃ¢ÂÂs what I say. I say if the Prime Minister is as convinced as she says she is that there has to be a carbon  tax, she should go to the people, seek a mandate. If she gets it, great; if she doesnÃ¢ÂÂt, well, thatÃ¢ÂÂs as it should  be.

DAVID OLDFIELD:

Yes of course, but to go to an election would be requiring a person to make a decision who had principles  because itÃ¢ÂÂs really only going to be the Prime Minister who decides itÃ¢ÂÂs going to happen unless we wait for  the normal cycle, a couple of years away. So we are really not likely to get an election. Is there any hope you  can force something through? Is there the prospect that any independent might change over?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well David, look, IÃ¢ÂÂm on my way down to Wollongong, to the Illawarra area to visit a coal mine, the  Peabody Metropolitan Coal Mine, the oldest continuing coal mine in Australia. ThereÃ¢ÂÂs 300 jobs directly  dependent on this mine, thereÃ¢ÂÂs probably another 1,000 jobs indirectly dependent on this mine. This is  exactly the kind of operation that will be at grave risk under the Prime MinisterÃ¢ÂÂs carbon tax and frankly the  member for Cunningham, Sharon Bird, she should be more concerned to protect the jobs of her constituents  than she should be to protect the bad policy of a failing government and I think as this debate develops a lot  of Labor members are thinking Ã¢ÂÂgee whiz, what have we got ourselves into?Ã¢ÂÂ This carbon tax is toxic for  jobs, toxic for the cost of living and itÃ¢ÂÂs not going to help the environment. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs the other thing about it.

DAVID OLDFIELD:

Make no difference, just bring pain, absolutely no gain and indeed earlier this morning on this programme,  Tony, Chris Hartcher the Minister for Energy here in New South Wales made it very clear that the New  South Wales Government is absolutely totally opposed to the carbon tax as a government and will fight it  every inch of the way so you are not on your own in the form of listeners, in the form of people including  myself and indeed it would seem now the whole New South Wales Government. I wish you well in  everything you are doing.

TONY ABBOTT:

Thanks so much David.

DAVID OLDFIELD:

Thank you. Take care.
