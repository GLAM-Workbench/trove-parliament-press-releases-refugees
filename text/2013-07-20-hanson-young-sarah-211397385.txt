Greens call for Labor Party to pay for Rudd's election advertising blitz

The Australian Greens have called for the Labor party to pay for Kevin Rudd's mega  advertising campaign promoting Labor's cruel new policy on refugees.

"This advertising campaign is designed only to help Kevin Rudd's election chances as he  rushes to the polls and shouldn't be bankrolled by the Australian taxpayer‚Äù, Greens  immigration spokesperson Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said today.

"There are rules that are meant to prevent Governments using taxpayer money to promote  their own political endeavours.

"Advertising campaigns with expenditure in excess of $250,000 are meant to be considered  by the Independent Communications Committee, to avoid Governments rorting the system.

"The Rudd Government must release the full costs of Labor's new election advertising  campaign and the findings of the ICC.

"If the Independent Committee hasn't met to approve these ads the Government must  explain on what basis they have by-passed the usual rules.

"This is crass promotion of the rush to refugee cruelty as Kevin Rudd rushes to the polls and  it should be paid for by the Labor Party, not taxpayers.
