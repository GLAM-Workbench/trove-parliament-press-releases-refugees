Abbott Government must come clean on tow-backs

The Australian Government must clarify the situation regarding tow-backs on the Indian Ocean  and be up front with the Australian people about its dangerous and costly policies, the  Australian Greens have said.

“History has shown that the Indonesian press is a far more reliable source than the Australian  Government when it comes to tow-backs,” the Greens’ immigration spokesperson, Senator  Sarah Hanson-Young said.

“After fracturing the relationship with Indonesia and tarnishing the reputation of the Navy with  Operation Blame the Soldiers, it’s clear that Tony Abbott’s tow-backs have gone too far.

“Turn-backs are both dangerous and illegal, but they’re also putting the lives of Australian  officers and asylum seekers at extreme risk.

“Rather than towing people back to danger and infuriating our neighbours, the Australian  Government should be working with our regional allies to give people a safer way to reach  protection.”
