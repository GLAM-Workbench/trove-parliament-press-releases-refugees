TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW

Subjects:  Japanese earthquake



E & O E - PROOF ONLY

MICHAEL ROWLAND:  The Federal Government is still trying to confirm the safety of  Australians believed to be in the areas worst hit by the Japanese earthquake and tsunami.

The Attorney-General Robert McClelland says the Government has real concerns for 140  Australians who are registered in affected areas but are still unaccounted for.  Consular  officials have been busily visiting hospitals and evacuation centres to try to track them  down.

For now we're joined by the Foreign Affairs Minister Kevin Rudd from Canberra.  Mr Rudd  good morning and thanks for your time.

KEVIN RUDD:   Thanks for having me on the program.

MICHAEL ROWLAND:    What's the latest information you have about those Australians who  are still unaccounted for?

KEVIN RUDD:    Well there is a very methodical process we go through with natural  disasters.  Firstly we've had as of five o'clock this morning some 7600-plus calls in from the  Australian public.  Based on the information I have to hand we have now confirmed the

whereabouts of 2610 of those.  People should not be alarmed by that gap.  It takes us time  to work through each of these cases individually.

In the disaster affected areas we now have some 306 registered Australians who we know  to have been in disaster affected areas.

So far we've confirmed the whereabouts of 128 and their safety.

So we'll continue to work through the list and that's why we have consular teams on the  ground in the disaster affected areas.

MICHAEL ROWLAND:    Equally should we read much into that gap between the 306 and the  128 of those Australians in the worst affected areas?

KEVIN RUDD:   The Australian Government remains concerned about the wellbeing of all  Australians caught up in natural disasters like this and that's why we dedicate a large  number of our consular resources to sorting out the detail of each.

Let me give you an example.  We now have consular teams who are in Sendai itself, which  as you know has been massively affected by both the earthquake and the associated  tsunami.

This team has been very active on the ground there.  We further dispatched a team from  Sendai further north of there to a location if you'll allow me to consult my notes which is  called Ishinomaki which is a city north of Sendai and yesterday we were able to confirm the  safety and wellbeing of a further eight Australians.

Elsewhere in the country our consular team has identified another four Australians who are  safe and well in disaster affected areas in and around Iwate prefecture, Iwate.  These were  Australians who were participating in the Australian Japan Exchange and Teaching Program  called JET.

So we are doing this on the ground, going from hospital to hospital, emergency shelter to  emergency shelter to track down Australians and match them against the registration  details which have been provided by Australians back home.

MICHAEL ROWLAND:   Are you considering sending more consular officials for instance to  beef up those efforts?

KEVIN RUDD:        Yes we're continuing to roll in consular support from both Australia and  from surrounding diplomatic posts in Northeast Asia.  Based on my discussion with the  Secretary of my department yesterday, we will keep this under continuing review.

We've already sent in I think one group of 10 consular officials.  Another group of five, six or  seven have gone in from surrounding posts.  The key criteria here is to make sure they're all  Japanese language proficient so that when we're on the ground dealing with prefectural  authorities and local search and rescue authorities as well as local public health authorities,  that we don't have a language problem, and that's what we're doing and we'll continue to  send in more as is necessary.

MICHAEL ROWLAND:        Mr Rudd are you completely satisfied with the information we're  getting from Japanese authorities about how they're dealing with the situation at the  Fukushima nuclear power plant?

KEVIN RUDD:        Well as you know I raised this matter with the Japanese Foreign Minister a  couple of nights ago to ensure that ourselves and the rest of the international community  were receiving a full flow of technical information from the Japanese nuclear authorities,  both to the International Atomic Energy Agency and its national affiliates and in our case, in  Australia's case, the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Authority.

Having been briefed by that authority yesterday the acronym is ARPANSA, ARPANSA advise  us that they are now in a process and have been now for some days assessing all the  technical data coming out of Japan through the IAEA.  That process together with the work  been done by other authorities around the world is being done at a highly proficient and  technical level.  And we have further offered to the Japanese additional staff support from  ARPANSA to go to Japan if they need it.  That offer as yet has not been taken up.

MICHAEL ROWLAND:        And given what we're witnessing at Fukushima and perhaps  another couple of power plants in Japan, does this give you pause for thought about the  option of Australia ever pursing nuclear power on its own?

KEVIN RUDD:        Look I think that's a debate for another occasion.  You know what well and  established and long standing Australian Government policy is on that matter and we don't  see any change happening on that score.  But I think our immediate challenge right now in  Japan is (1) to ensure that we are working as closely as possible with the Japanese  authorities concerning both Fukushima and the various units within that nuclear plant, units  one, two and three which have experienced some difficulties in recent days as well as other  nuclear reactors as well.

The most recent advice I have from ARPANSA on that - if you don't mind me again  consulting my notes, is that according to ARPANSA we have concerns that all three units at  the Fukushima site, that's at Daiichi, are at risk of continued hydrogen generation,  particularly resulting in further explosions.  The current information suggests however that  the containment is still intact at Fukushima site number one, that's at units one, two and  three within Fukushima site number one.  And we continue to monitor closely what is  happening with each of these facilities and other Japanese nuclear facilities.

MICHAEL ROWLAND:        Mr Rudd if we could just touch on a couple of other issues before  we wrap up.  Julian Assange on the ABC's Q&A program last night alleged that the Australian  Government was exchanging information with other countries about Australians working for  the WikiLeaks website.  Is the Australian Government doing it?

KEVIN RUDD:        Well first thing I'd say is I've been completely pre-occupied with Japan as  well as what's been going on in the Middle East and Libya in the last 24 hours including  overnight.

On this matter however and before coming on air this morning I checked with the Secretary  of my department.  I'm unaware of any such so-called exchange going on.  The Secretary of  my department is unaware of any such exchange going on.  I also checked with the office of



Minister’s Office: 02 6277 7500 or 0466 745 615                               Department: 02 6261 1555

the Attorney-General, his office is unaware of any such exchange going on and that is the  current status of our knowledge on this.

MICHAEL ROWLAND:        And before we came to you we played a clip from the British  Prime Minister David Cameron in full voice calling for strong international action on Libya, as  you know the G8 foreign ministers meeting in Paris is getting underway with strong calls for  a no-fly zone, do you see that now as increasingly inevitable, a no-fly zone being post over  Libya?

KEVIN RUDD:        Let's be very clear about the military situation on the ground.  This is a  very, very difficult, critical military environment in which opposition forces are facing the  military machine of Qaddafi's regime.  Qaddafi has been using air assets of one form or  another.  He's been making use of reconnaissance aircraft in order to assist his ground  operations, which as you know from the public reporting has achieved some success in the  west of the country and now to the east as well.

On the question of international reactions we are appreciative of the position taken by the  Arab League in Cairo on Saturday and having spoken to a number of the foreign ministers  involved in that meeting, prior to it and subsequent to it, this is an important decision by the  Arab League.  It sends a very clear message to the UN Security Council in New York that the  regional body, the Arab League has a singular mind on this, although the Syrians have  parted company in part I'm advised.

The bottom line is this: it now lies within the purview of the UN Security Council.  Our  position as an Australian government is that the UN Security Council should consider this  matter and furthermore it should respond positively to the position which has been put by  the Arab League and its deliberations on Saturday.

MICHAEL ROWLAND:     And pursue a no-fly zone?

KEVIN RUDD:      Absolutely, I'm sorry that's the reference of my remarks.

MICHAEL ROWLAND:      Now but do you fear though that given all the reports coming out  of Libya about pro-Qaddafi forces being well and truly on the march and moving into rebel  held towns, by the time we get to any possible UN Security Council vote on a no-fly zone it  may be simply too late?

KEVIN RUDD:        Well as you know I've been concerned about this for more than two  weeks.  The Australian Government put out this position on 25 February, it's quite a time  ago and since then we've seen a deterioration in the military environment within Libya from  the point of view of opposition forces.

Obviously the international diplomacy on this has been torturous.  Our position has been  clear throughout.  The meeting of the Arab League though is the principle regional body on  this has been important.  It now lies within the purview of the UN Security Council.

My most recent advice is that overnight in New York the Council has met informally both on  this and a range of other elements of the Libyan scenario and it is in my view important that  the Security Council respond positively to the position which has been taken by the Arab  League.

Let's be very frank about this, it's a very difficult dangerous military environment on the  ground and a no-fly zone is one part of the response to this.  On the ground however, let's  be fully recognising of the fact that Qaddafi's military assets are formidable within his  possession and therefore we've got to continue to provide whatever international support  we can to opposition forces.

It's one of the reasons also why the Australian Government has been at the forefront of  providing international humanitarian assistance through agencies such as the Red Cross,  such as the High Commissioner for Refugees, such as the World Food Program, to deal with  the emerging humanitarian crisis on both borders, as well as through the Red Cross to the  extent possible providing humanitarian assistance within the country as well.

MICHAEL ROWLAND:        Okay Kevin Rudd, thank you very much for your time this  morning.

KEVIN RUDD:                Thanks for having me on the program.   END
