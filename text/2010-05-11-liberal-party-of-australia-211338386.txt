Joe Hockey, MP  Shadow Treasurer

INTERVIEW WITH RADIO 2GB SYDNEY - 8.40PM TUESDAY 11 MAY, 2010

11th May 2010

E&OE……………………….…………………………………………………………………

PRESENTER:

G’day.

JOE HOCKEY:

G’day, fellas.

PRESENTER:

Alright, well, this is pretty bold predictions in this and a lot of significant assumptions. Does it add  up?

JOE HOCKEY:

No, it doesn’t, it’s a shameless con job. The Government assumes that because they increase the  tobacco tax, fewer people are going to smoke, but they also assume that because they’re introducing a  $9 billion a year mining tax there’s going to be more investment in mining.  It’s illogical. In fact,  they’re assuming the best terms of trade for 60 years on the back of mining and yet they are slugging  it with a $9 billion a year new tax. This defies logic - that you can put in place a massive new tax and  there’s going to be far more investment, and that underpins all the assumptions in the Budget.

PRESENTER:

Now, by 2011-12, two years time, the Government says that total business investment will be rising at  a rate of 12.5 per cent. Now, you’d have to say that that is pretty spectacular.  Non-dwelling  construction, which was going to be largely the mining investment that was going to come, will be  rising at 14.5 per cent. Do you think that’s feasible, because all of that quite clearly is actually what  the Budget is going to be based upon?

JOE HOCKEY:

It’s based on false assumptions and Treasury got the numbers dramatically wrong last year.  I believe  this year the Government is not telling the truth about the Budget.  For example, last year they had the  biggest spending Budget in a generation.  They have, on last year’s numbers, increased expenditure  by $26 billion and here’s the thing - it took 25 minutes tonight for Wayne Swan to say the word  ‘deficit’. This year the deficit is $40 billion and in truth the Government until the day it returns a  surplus, which is at least three years, will be borrowing $711 million a week. $711 million a week.  That’s money that is not going to small business or homeowners.

There’s a few other things you ought to know: they’re spending nearly a billion dollars on asylum  seekers to address the problem of their failed border protection. They’re spending nearly a billion

dollars fixing the pink batt programme. They are spending $500 million on a new health bureaucracy  that Wayne Swan and Kevin Rudd said wouldn’t increase.

PRESENTER:

But surely you have to applaud the Government for at least having a plan to get itself back into  Budget surpluses and as a result to be addressing the debts that they now say will actually peak out at  around $93 billion?

JOE HOCKEY:

They never have delivered a surplus Budget, they never will deliver a surplus Budget, Ross. If you’re  going to have a Budget it’s got to be based on real facts and what they’re doing is they’re claiming  that a $9 billion a year tax is going to deliver them surplus Budgets in three years time.

PRESENTER:

So, is the Opposition right now committed to actually opposing that tax on mining?

JOE HOCKEY:

Absolutely, because it is bad for Australia. You do not speed up the field of athletes by putting a ball  and chain around your fastest runner. It is inconceivable that you could get away with that and I was  absolutely dumbfounded at the words of the Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank today when he  said on the front page of the AFR that he wants to see, allegedly he said this, he wants to see a major  mining project fall over.

PRESENTER:

Which doesn’t seem to make any sense to anybody because quite clearly that obviously is going to  have an impact on unemployment. Unemployment here is expected to drop to four-and-three-quarter  per cent.

JOE HOCKEY:

Well, and you know what they’ve given up because four-and-three-quarter per cent they claim is full  employment. We left them with 3.9 per cent unemployment. That means there’s 80,000 people out  there that the Government has given up on getting a job.

PRESENTER:

Joe Hockey, thanks for dropping by.
