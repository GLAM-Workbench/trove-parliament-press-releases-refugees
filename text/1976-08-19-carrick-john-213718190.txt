MIGRANT EDUCATION PROGRAMS TO CONTINUE UNCHANGED i

Commonwealth Government migrant education programs  will be maintained in 1976-77 at the same level of  activity as in 1975-76, the Minister for Education,

Senator Garrick, said today. Expenditure would be  increased.

Senator Garrick said some reports of the Budget had

suggested wrongly that the amount of Federal money to  be spent on migrant education was*to be reduced by  up to 50 per cent. .

This was incorrect. In fact,  direct expenditure would be  increased from $28,731,313 in 1975-76 to $30,655,000  in the current financial year.

In addition there was expenditure proposed for capital  works and services in connection with education centres  in hostels and migrant education centres in capital ' - t\

cities.

Misunderstandings had occurred because, since the last  Budget,  responsibility for reimbursing the States for  money spent on child migrant education had been  transferred from the Department of Education to the  Schools ^Commission.

In 1975-76 an amount of $10.3 million was spent by the%  Department on child migrant education. This amount covered

expenditure from July to December 1975 only. In January  1976 funding became the responsibility of the Schools Commission.

The Commission had made provision to spend $20,212 million  in 1976 and a total of $21,645 million was recommended for

1977 under its proposed General Recurrent Grants Program.

In addition to these amounts, the Department of Education  Ã¢ÂÂ   '  t * i had also estimated an expenditure in 1976-77 of $691,-000 on child migrant education which would be spent on the

production of materials, conferences, special arrangements  for refugee children and a language test development  project.

Senator Garrick said that in addition to the child migrant

education program, the Department of Education estimated

that it would spend $7,920 on its adult migrant education  program. .

Additional amounts to be spent on full-time intensive  English language courses for migrants, pre-embarkation and  shipboard language instruction and other items would raise  the level of Departmental expenditure to $10.6 million

in 1976-77.

This was slightly increased over the amount spent on these  items last year. Senator Garrick said.
