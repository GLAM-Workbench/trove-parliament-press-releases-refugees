DEDUCTIBILITY OF GIFTS TO AUSTRALIA FOR UNHCR

The Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer Senator Helen Coonan, today announced that the Government has decided to amend the income tax law to extend the period during which tax deductible gifts to the value of $2 or more can be made to the Australia for UNHCR.

As a result, gifts made to the Fund after 27 June 2002 and before 28 June 2007 will be tax deductible.

"Australia for UNHCR was established to raise funds to conduct educational, promotional and fundraising activities on behalf of the UNHCR in Australia to support the work of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees," Senator Coonan said.

"Tax deductible gift status will help the Australia for UNHCR to attract public support for its activities."

Legislation to give effect to the Government's decision will be introduced as soon as practicable.

Senator Coonan said taxpayers should ensure that they receive a receipt for their donation to allow them to claim a tax deduction.
