DEMOCRATS CALL FOR

RECOGNITION OF ERITREA fwc._

The Australian Democrats today called on the Australian Government to  officially recognia~ Eritrea. as an independent and sovereign state.

Foreign Affairs Spokesperson for the Democrats, Senator Vicki Bourne,  congratulated the people of Eritrea on their overwhelming vote in favour of  independence.

Senator Bourne said "Many Australians have a special respect for the people of  Eritrea and their long and brave struggle for freedom.

"As a practical recognition of that respect the Australian Government should  recognise Eritrea's independence and commit Australia to provide development  and food aid, which will be crucial to the new nation.

"Eritrea's already woefully inadequate resources, especially food, will be further  strained by the expected return of hundreds of thousands of refugees and exiles,  who number approximately 750,000.

''When Eritrean independence is declared on May 24, 1993, the practical goodwill  of the people of Australia should be extended to the people of Eritrea.

''With Eritrean independence, the difficulties of Australian government aid will be  alleviated.

"Australia must join the United States and Italy which have already announced  their intention to formally recognise Eritrea."
