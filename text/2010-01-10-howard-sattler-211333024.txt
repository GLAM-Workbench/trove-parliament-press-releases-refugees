TRANSCRIPT OF SENATOR GARY HUMPHRIES

INTERVIEW WITH HOWARD SATTLER,

6PR PERTH

Subjects: Christmas Island dance lessons

SATTLER:

Yes, picture this; a group of mainly Muslim men from places like Afghanistan and Iraq and other  parts of the world dancing, lime dancing, boot scooting at Christmas Island where they’re being  detained while we work out whether they’re legitimate refugees or just asylum seekers trying to beat  the system. Yes, you think I’m joking. No, I’m not. In fact it’s been confirmed by no less than the  Immigration Minister Chris Evans who said when he first went to there was a group - these are his  words - by the previous contractors and had a very attractive woman, he said, had a very full class of  Afghan men learning boot scooting to the tune of Kenny Rodgers. What next? Well this has been  revealed after questions asked by Liberal Senator Gary Humphries at a Senate estimates hearing  overnight. Hello Gary.

GARY HUMPHRIES:

Afternoon, Howard. How are you?

SATTLER:

Afternoon, what is it that led you to ask about this kind of activity?

GARY HUMPHRIES:

We were trying to find out what was going on on Christmas Island. As you know the population of  the detention centre is almost full to overflowing at the moment and we want to know what is  happening to keep these people occupied and we’d heard there was a dance teacher that was being  provided on the island and when we asked the question about the dance teacher, the Minister

volunteered that he wasn’t sure about a dance teacher but he certainly knew that there’d previously  been an attractive young woman, as you pointed out, who had been teaching all of these asylum  seekers all about boot scooting. We thought he was joking to start with, it sounded just too incredible  for words. But he was quiet sincere and apparently that is one of the range of activities that are  provided to those people who are detained on Christmas Island.

SATTLER:

Incredible, was he apologetic?

GARY HUMPHRIES:

No, he was in fact laughing about the whole thing and I would have felt like laughing if it hadn’t been  so serious because what we have here is a large population of people being detained on the island at  enormous expense to the Australian community. The whole department is spending more than a  billion dollars a year dealing with a range of immigration issues, a very large part of which is those

people who are arriving in boats. Obviously we need to deal with these people humanely and cater to  their needs such as food and clothing and shelter and so-on....

SATTLER:

...They wouldn’t have asked for boot scooting, surley...

GARY HUMPHRIES:

...They wouldn’t have asked for boot scooting and I very much doubt any of them came to Australia  for the sake of getting their hands on a bit of boot scooting. It’s not the only service they get on the  island, I might point out. We understand that there are yoga classes available, sewing classes, cooking  classes, bingo nights, trivia evenings, movie nights, music club...

SATTLER:

...What kind of trivia? Trivial Pursuit?

GARY HUMPHRIES:

Probably, the Afghan version perhaps. I don’t know.

SATTLER:

So what else? We got to trivia.

GARY HUMPHRIES:

Music classes, arts and craft activities, badminton, volley ball, group fitness training, indoor cricket...

SATTLER:

...Indoor cricket...

GARY HUMPHRIES:

...Yes, obviously this is a crash course in how to be an Australia. I mean you go through the boot  scooting and the indoor cricket and basket ball, indoor football, there are tennis courts there. And we  had lots of debate about the food that was being served there that was being imported from the  mainland at very considerable expense. Again, I want to say I’m not begrudging them the basics of  life, it’s important that you provide that to people who are in our care and custody but the concern that  we had was that this was being provided now to a growing number of people every week...

SATTLER:

...and access to mobile phones and internet...

GARY HUMPHRIES:

...yes, they’re entitled to use Facebook and Twitter and they can send emails and so forth. It does  seem to me that we’ve gone a bit overboard here.

SATTLER:

Even if you don’t make it, even if you’re not approved it’s not about having a holiday is it?

GARY HUMPHRIES:

I’ve heard it said that when the Indonesian fisherman who get caught in our waters every so often,  fishing illegally, get taken to the Darwin centre for being held for a few weeks, they have the time of  their life. They get three square meals a day, very good food, good place to sleep, entertainment of  various sorts so we ought to ask ourselves what is the purpose of this kind of detention facility, is it to  hold and detain until a decision can be made about the future of these people or is it to provide  something somewhat more luxurious than many Australians would actually have...

SATTLER:

...I thought it was actually thought it was to, in someway, to try and dissuade them from trying to get  here by that method.

GARY HUMPHRIES:

I would have thought that should be the case as well, Howard. I would have thought it be absolutely  imperative for the Government to clearly indicate that coming to Australia, in small leaky boats, is a  bad idea...

SATTLER:

...I wonder if the sneaky buggers have brochures on all this? This is what happens when you get there.

GARY HUMPHRIES:

The people smugglers clearly use a number of sales pictures, I don’t know whether they describe the  boot scooting at Christmas Island as one of those things. But you’d have to wonder what they do say  and it is a worry. It ought not to be the impression that is created of what Australia will do for people  who illegally enter its territorial waters for the purpose of bypassing other orderly processes of  obtaining humanitarian visas to live in Australia and rather use this device to obtain easier access to  Australia...

SATTLER:

...And the poor souls in those camps who try to do it legitimately who are still parked and parked for  years in places like Afghanistan wouldn’t be getting the same kind of treatment...

GARY HUMPHRIES:

...Absolutely not and that’s the tragedy. There’s a lot of people who desperately need our generosity  who’ve been waiting for years and years and years in camps who won’t get it because others are  getting it in another way much earlier.

SATTLER:

Thanks, Gary.

GARY HUMPHRIES:

Thanks, Howard.

SATTLER:

Gary Humphries, Liberal Senator exposing the boot scooting classes on Christmas Island. You heard  the whole range there, unbelievable, trivia nights, bingo, arts and crafts, indoor cricket, tennis courts.  Tough isn’t it. I reckon people smugglers have a list of all of it and say just look - get there - we’ll

get you there and this is what you get. Unbelievable.       Josh Manuatu  Media & Portfolio Adviser, Office of Senator Gary Humphries  LIBERAL SENATOR FOR THE ACT  Shadow Parliamentary Secretary for Families, Housing & Human Services,  Shadow Parliamentary Secretary for Citizenship  Phone (02)6277 3446, Mobile 0421 115 365  Twitter @GaryHumphries | Facebook /Senator.Humphries    www.garyhumphries.com      Ã¯Â¿Â½ Please consider the environment before printing this e-mail.
