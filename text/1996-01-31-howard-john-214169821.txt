TRANSCRIPT OF THE LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION  THE HON JOHN HOWARD MP DOORSTOP INTERVIEW - DANDENONG RANGES NATIONAL PARK

E&EO.............................................................................................................................................

It is a beautiful part o f the electorate o f Latrobe and I acknowledge the presence o f  Bob Charles, the Federal Member for LaTrobe, and to say how delighted I am to use  this opportunity to launch the document entitled Preserving Our National Heritage  which is the Environmental Policy statement o f  the Liberal and National Parties for the

1996 election. This represents the most comprehensive commitment o f  the Coalition  to on-going environmental policies ever made.

In the year that I have been the Leader o f the Coalition and all the thousands o f  young  people that I have spoken to around Australia there are two things that come through  very clearly and that is that the great bulk o f  the young people o f  Australia are

interested in two things above everything else, and they are jobs and preserving our  national heritage, preserving our environment for the future.

It is therefore not surprising that so much o f  the election campaign o f  the Coalition is  directed towards providing long term, durable answers to those two problems. I have  said much in the past few days about a realistic job strategy for young Australians  through the revitalisation o f small business.

Today I am announcing an environmental policy which I believe not only meets the  desire o f young Australians, and their government, to care about in a practical way the  future o f the natural environment, but also to Australians o f all generations. Concern  about the environment is no longer some kind o f  fetish, pseudo-intellectual passing

phase issue, it is now a mainstream issue o f  permanent concern to Australians o f  all  generations and that is a point that I have made time and time again, not only in the  period I have been Leader o f the Opposition, but also before that, and therefore what  we have decided to do in this policy is to make the biggest-ever commitment o f  the  Coalition Parties across the board to tackle environmental issues. The policy contains

major commitments in relation to revegetation, it repeats the commitments that I have  already announced in relation to the Murray Darling, It recommits the Coalition to the  national water audit, it contains major initiatives to clean up Australia's rivers, it  contains a major commitment to the natural reserve system and it also contains major

initiatives in relation to our coast line and our sea, having in mind in particular the  outfall problem which worries many Australians in many parts o f  the country.

The centrepiece o f  the whole policy is the initiative to establish a natural heritage trust  o f Australia. That will be a special fund initially comprised o f  $1 billion, that $1 billion  will come out o f the proceeds o f  the part privatisation o f  Telstra. We have said that  when you sell an asset, wh m you dispose o f a capital asset you should use the

proceeds o f  that sale for capital purposes. We anticipate receiving $8 billion from the  sale o f  Telstra. We will commitment $7 o f that $8 billion, in other words $7 billion  will go entirely and without qualification to get retirement. The other $1 billion will be  invested into this fund, out o f  the (inaudible) o f that trust fund those components o f   our program that can properly be described as capital, such as the Murray Darling  clean up and the water audit and many other features o f  the program, those things  those capital items will paid for out o f the(inaudible) The interest accruing from time to  time on the trust fund will be used in part to pay recurrent expenses in the

environmental area. At the end o f five years there will be $300 million left in the fUnd  and that will be kept there in perpetuity and the interest earned on that money will be  used to fund environmental projects. The total commitment is $1.15 billion, the  document that we will be handing you contains a detailed explanation and tables  dealing with all o f  the various aspects o f the policy. I should say that there is within  that $1.15 billion a program in relation to land care and other matters o f  particular  concern to rural producers which will be detailed when John Anderson, my colleague,  the Deputy Leader o f the National Party and spokesman on Primary Industry, when he

launches his Primary Industry Policy.

So, ladies and gentlemen this is a very substantial policy. I acknowledge that there are  features o f the environmental policy brought down by the Government last w eek which  are valuable. Those policies in part duplicate policies that we've already announced  and to the extent that in an area like this there are some common elements then so be  it, and there is no reason from time to time there can't be common ground even in the  middle o f an election campaign between Government and Opposition on particular  aspects on particular policies. But the qualitative difference between this policy and  the policy o f  the Government is that our commitment so far as the revegetation  program is concerned is significant and the Government's commitment in that area is

fairly minimal, and also we have a much bigger commitment in relation to cleaning up  our rivers and also the establishment o f the trust fund represents not only symbolically,  but in a very concrete form a commitment into the future to the caring for and the  preservation o f  our environment.

Environmental concern is now something that (inaudible) in the political and social  consciousness o f all Australians. The Coalition knows that. It recognises it and I  believe that this policy gives eloquent and practical assistance to that view and to that  realisation.

I'm happy to take questions. I should say that I have brought thankfully, happily, my  two colleagues, Senator Kemp, the Shadow Minister for the Environment and John  Anderson, the Deputy Leader o f  the National Party and the Shadow for Primary  Industry along to answer the more technical difficult questions which will be beyond

me, but also because you would never forgive if I didn't.

I would, before concluding my opening remarks I would like to formally launch Bob  Charles' campaign for the seat o f  LaTrobe. We are in the beautiful electorate o f

2

LaTrobe, Bob is the Secretary o f  the Shadow Cabinet and w e are very grateful, Bob,  that you are here and you're launched and I'm sure you will be back after the second o f  March.

JOURNALIST:

Mr Howard, is your package contingent on the sale o f  Telstra, in other words what  happens if it doesn't get through the Senate?

HOW ARD:

The establishment o f  the Natural Heritage Trust o f  Australia will only occur if  the sale  o f Telstra goes ahead. I am confident, confident for a number o f reasons that the  partial privatisation Telstra will go ahead.

JOURNALIST:

Is this a way o f  ensuring Democrat and Green support for the Telstra sale?

HOW ARD:

Well, the question o f  what the Democrats and the Greens do is a matter for them. I  have said before and I’ll repeat it that I enjoy cordial relations with Cheryl Kemot and  her colleagues in the Democrats. I've always been able to talk to them and I’ll go on  doing that. And I would hope that a policy and a program which is so obviously

directed towards areas that they have a long professed interest in is that one that they  would think very hard about before rejecting but that is a matter for them. I am  pitching for Coalition control o f the Senate. Don't let anybody be in any doubt about  that. Don't anybody think that we're not running for the best possible outcome in the

election so we will deal with those things in time. I am confident that the Parliament  will approve our plan to sell Telstra - a third o f it - but it is the case as Alan suggested  that w e need the Telstra sale to establish the National Heritage.

JOURNALIST:

Mr Howard, will all funding for spending on the environment - both new and recurrent  spending - come from the fund. ..

HOW ARD:

No. What comes from the fund are things, and the document says this, things that can  be regarded as capital and in addition any interest accruing from time to time can be  used to offset recurrent expenditure in the environment area, but in addition to that  there will still be money coming out o f the budget. Don't anybody imagine that this is

a device to sort o f  not fund things out o f the budget. Let me make it very, very dear  that this policy, the commitments in this policy are over and above current Government  expenditure and over and above in a number o f areas, and I have specified a couple o f  them, the commitments made by the Prime Minister last week. There can be no doubt

3

that it has the funding base th at! have specified and I believe and I am confident that  the Parliament will approve the plan to sell one third o f Telstra

JOURNALIST:

One problem that some o f the environmental groups have identified is that the  Coalition would loathe to override States in some areas, particularly forests. Can you  say now  that your Government would actually be prepared to use the external affairs  power i f  necessary, for environmental protection?

HOW ARD:

Well I have said before that in Government w e would through our more cooperative  approach to  the Commonwealth/State issue, w e would get better cooperation I am  sure from State Governments and we would always try to secure cooperation. We  operate differently from the Government. We have said in particular cases as a last  resort, the external affairs power would be used. But I qualify it in those terms quite

deliberately and quite unapologetically because I do not believe that the external affairs  power should be a device o f  first resort. It ought to be a device o f last resort.

JOURNALIST:

D o you expect this to be enough to give you a crack at Green preferences in crucial seats like this?

HOW ARD:

Well I don't talk about these things in terms o f enough. Nothing will be enough to be,  in a policy sense, other than the satisfaction o f  knowing that I have put together a  policy that provides a longterm answer to a very serious national problem. The  question o f  Green preferences and Democrat preferences is a matter for the Party  organisation around Australia to negotiate. It is obviously a good environmental  policy and anybody in the Australian community who cares about the environment in a  long term sense will have to acknowledge the comprehensive nature o f this, the

stability o f the funding base, the fact that w e have tackled issues that are o f  practical  ongoing concern. I mean this is practical reform so far as the environment is  concerned. We are tackling the bread and butter issues that concern many  environmentalists and I think it is a demonstration that any suggestion that w e don't

have sound environmental credentials, all o f that belongs to the past.

M EM B ER  OF PUBLIC:

Mr Howard I am a local resident. I live 4kms from here and we have got a major  environmental issue only 2.2km$ from where you stand. Just in that location there is a  National Trust classified view that is about to be desecrated by a developer putting  agricultural igloos there. N ow  the developer is being subsidised by the Federal

Government to the tune o f  $251,750. Would you do anything to cause a rethink on  this or will this desecration be allowed to go ahead?

4

HOWARD;

What I will do is invite Bob Charles as the local member to get me all o f  the details. I  am not going to give a decision on the spot I would like to look at all the details o f  it  and then I will give you a response.

JOURNALIST:

You mention ocean outfalls and its use in NSW . What is your commitment there? Are  you wanting to close them or review them or what?

HOW ARD;

Well we recognise that they are a problem and w e are making funds available to  examine each o f them to see what might be the appropriate solution, ÃÂ mean w e are  putting funds in a program that will run for a number o f years and in some cases it  could lead to one or other o f  those results.

JOURNALIST:

Would you like to see Sydney outfalls shut down?

HOW ARD:

I would like to see a huge improvement. I really would. I don’t want to pre-empt the  outcome o f  some o f the studies.

That chap up there had a question.

JOURNALIST:

Mr Howard, in what way does your policy address the woodchipping issue?

HOW ARD:

Well I think what is does is it contains a very, very strong commitment to the reserve  system. It repeats the commitment that I made when I responded to the Prime  Minister's statement that w e accepted the broad benchmark o f  15% that was laid down  by the Prime Minister although recognising, as I think most people do, that in some

areas that raises, or might have the potential to raise difficulty, but w e nonetheless  committed ourselves to that. You will find in the detailed wording o f  the policy other  evidence that I think gave a very intelligent balanced approach by us on that issue.

JOURNALIST;

Could you just clarify the funding issue? This new commitment is on top o f  the  existing environmental funding, but are you saying that existing funding is protected  from being touched.

5

HOWARD:

We don't have any plans to cut it.

JOURNALIST:

Is there a guarantee, an "iron clad guarantee" to use one o f your own phrases, that it is  protected from cuts. Is that right?

HO W ARD:

It is over and above.

JOURNALIST:

And protected from cuts?

HO W ARD:

Yes.

JOURNALIST:

D oes the scale o f  this statement suggest that the Coalition in past elections has failed  to appreciate the importance o f the environment?

HOW ARD:

Look I see no merit Michael, in one election campaign talking about examining the  entrails o f earlier campaigns. I think that is a waste o f  time.

JOURNALIST:

Mr Howard, can you guarantee that along the way that more o f  the $8 billion can be  wiped o E  onto projects like this?

HO W ARD:

Well I just said to you today and let me repeat it, that the other $7 billion is going to  retire debt.

JOURNALIST:

Peter Costello said that some o f  that money is going to upgrade the Pacific Highway.

HOW ARD:

N o he didn't say that, if you are referring to his interview last night. Are you referring  to his interview last night?

6

JOURNALIST:

Yes.

HOW ARD:

I think he was asked would a capital asset, would the expenditure o f some o f the  proceeds o f  the sale o f Telstra on a capital asset, could that include the upgrading o f   say the Pacific Highway and he said yes.

I mean w e will be having something to say about the Pacific Highway but the point  Peter was trying to make, and I heard the interview - a very good one! - he made it  very clear that w e weren’t going to spend any o f this Telstra money on recurrent  expenditure. We were only going to spend it on capital purposes and that is exactly  what w e’d do. I regard investing in the restoration o f  the environment as every bit the  same in terms o f  restoring our infrastructure as in the building o f a highway. I f you  regard the building o f a highway as a capital expenditure, you have got to regard the  cleaning up o f the Murray Darling. You have got to regard cleaning up our river

system. You have got to regard preventing further soil degradation. You have got to  regard revegetation. All these things as being very much in the form o f a capital  investment.

JOURNALIST:

The sale o f  Telstra is bound to be a long, drawn out process given the size o f  the  exercise. Assuming you get it through the Senate, will you begin spending on these  environmental projects after you have got the go ahead from the Senate or while you  actually wait until you have the money in hand.

HOW ARD:

We anticipate having to use budget funding to commence some o f these things before  the Telstra money comes on stream. Yes.

JOURNALIST;

So is it possible that any o f  the other Telstra money could be allocated to capital  works?

HOW ARD:

No.

JOURNALIST:

So, what is your definition o f  retiring debt in that case?

7

HOWARD:

Just paying o f what we owe the people we have borrowed it from.

JOURNALIST:

Why didn't you mention it when you talked about the sale o f  Telstra?

HOW ARD:

But I did.

JOURNALIST:

You gave the impression that it was all going to be used (inaudible)

HOW ARD;

No, I did not. Lenore Taylor realised that ÃÂ didn’t either because she had it in the first  part o f her story. I said that we would not use any o f  it on the current expenditure, I  said it should essentially be used for definite times and purposes and when anybody  asked me I said it would be possible to use it for capital works.

JOURNALIST:

Are you going to use budget funding to bridge the gap, what will (inaudible)

HOW ARD:

Well I think what you should do, well the answer is nothing seriously because the  Telstra money would begin to come onstream in year 2 o f a Howard Government, so it  is nothing seriously.

JOURNALIST:

Mr Howard, what about woodchip quotas would you guarantee not to increase  woodchip quotas, export quotas.?

H O W AR D .

We don’t have any plans to do that.

JOURNALIST:

Mr Howard, the importance o f  the youth that is made (inaudible)

8

HOWARD:

No, I don't think that there is a contradiction. I mean a gove mment ought to govern  for ail o f  us in every sense o f the word. I think that w e have got the right balance o f   uranium. We sell uranium subject to very stringent international safe guards. The  three mine uranium policy was a Labor national conference rort. I mean anybody who

argues that the three mine uranium policy indicated the moral trauma o f the Labor  Party about the threat to the peace and security o f the world o f  selling uranium who  will believe anything.

I mean that was a dodge design to help out Labor mates like John Bannon and it owed  nothing to any kind o f  logic. I mean you are either comprehensively going to say no  uranium at all under any circumstances or alternatively you are going say any  intelligent nation that has a valuable natural resource will sell it subject to reasonable  safeguards and that's the alternative and that is the alternative that w e have chosen. We think it is right it is defensible and we've never disguised it.

JOURNALIST:

Mr Howard, this morning the balance o f payment figures came out they show a very  good lift in export It's much lower than many people in the market expected, does this  undermine your message at all that the government are not good economic managers.

HOW ARD:

Well, if you regard $1.6 billion as good you have got to be joking.

Ends.
