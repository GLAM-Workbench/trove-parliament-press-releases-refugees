JOHN SHAW:

Good morning, Tony. How are you?

TONY ABBOTT:

I’m well, John. It’s pretty soggy in Sydney but I guess it’s nice to be talking to you in beautiful Inverell and  surrounds.

JOHN SHAW:

Certainly is. You’d have to be buoyed by these latest figures showing the Coalition has a commanding lead  and also that you are the preferred Prime Minister?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, John, obviously it’s better to have good polls than bad polls, but polls honestly bounce around all over  the place and I’m sure that we’ll have some not-so-great polls between now and the election and in the end I  think the public are more interested in politicians with plans that they are in polls and what I want to assure  people is I’m not focused on polls, I’m focused on doing the right thing by them. That means getting rid of  the carbon tax, getting rid of the mining tax, cutting red tape, stopping the boats, building infrastructure,  taking some of the power off officials and giving some of it back to communities and to individuals. So,  that’s what I’m on about and I’m looking forward to the chance - should the people give it to us - to change  our country for the better.

JOHN SHAW:

At the weekend, Barnaby Joyce gained preselection for the Nationals in the seat of New England. What do  you think of that?

TONY ABBOTT:

I’m a big fan of Barnaby’s as you’d expect and I encouraged him to think of running for New England quite  some time ago and I’m pleased he’s now had the chance to give it a go. He was born in the area, he grew up  in New England, he went to university in New England, he’s worked in New England, his parents still have  property in New England. I think he’s going to be a very fierce campaigner and I think he’s going to be a  great fighter and representative for the people of New England should they choose him in September. I also  think he’s going to be a fine member of my frontbench and, I hope, a senior member of a Coalition  government.

JOHN SHAW:

Are you still considering moving a no confidence motion against the Government when Parliament resumes  for the budget session, even though Tony Windsor and Rob Oakeshott have indicated that they won’t  support such a motion?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, when last I heard them speak on this they said they were prepared to consider it. Now, John, obviously  you would be listening to Tony Windsor every day and I don’t always catch up with everything he’s said but  I certainly have no confidence in this government. I don’t believe the public has got confidence in this  Government, and, yes, it is our plan to put a motion of no confidence on the notice paper some time in  budget week and give Mr Windsor and Mr Oakeshott a chance to declare their true colours. Let’s face it,  Simon Crean and Martin Ferguson don’t have confidence in this Prime Minister any more. If Mr Windsor  and Mr Oakeshott have more confidence in Julia Gillard and her government than Simon Crean and Martin  Ferguson it would be very hard for them to claim under these circumstances to be really independent  members. I think they would just look like Labor members who aren’t absolutely honest and straight with  people about their true allegiances.

JOHN SHAW:

Do you expect there to be any real surprises in the budget?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think there is going to be a lot of red ink. Plainly, on form, there will be more accounting fiddles. There  will be more stealth taxes. There will be more big promises which are unlikely ultimately to be delivered  upon. At the moment, John, we have got the Government talking about all the money it is going to give  schools. Well, it is robbing Peter to pay Paul because it is taking money off universities, allegedly to give it  to schools, but in the 2010 election the Government made all sorts of commitments to teachers and to  schools: they committed to pay their teachers more - completely undelivered; they committed to pay what  they called excellent schools more - completely undelivered. This is a Government that is terrific at making  promises but absolutely hopeless at delivering and I think we will see a lot more evidence of that in the  budget.

JOHN SHAW:

Now, on another subject, the arrival of the boatload of asylum seekers in the Port of Geraldton in Western  Australia last week must ring alarm bells about our border security?

TONY ABBOTT:

Exactly right, John. Look, this boat was able to get right into an Australian mainland harbour without  detection and that is a real worry. Now, I know there are no infallible systems but nevertheless the fact that  this boat could get so close to Australia without detection is of concern but it is just symptomatic of a much  bigger concern and that is the fact that the Government has completely lost control of our borders and they  don’t have any plan. They have almost surrendered. They have basically said we give up. All they can do

every time a boat arrives - instead of adopting new and more effective policies - is attack the Opposition.  Well, really and truly, no wonder the people smugglers are having a lend of us.

JOHN SHAW:

I’ll be a huge job but if the Coalition wins the next election, how do you really think you’ll be able to stem  the flow of boats bringing asylum seekers to Australia?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I don’t underestimate the magnitude of the task because while John Howard certainly did stop the  boats, Julia Gillard has made the problem far, far worse than it ever was in John Howard’s time. But  nevertheless, the policy that was proven to work then will be the foundation of policies that will work in the  future: we’ll reintroduce temporary protection visas that will deny the people smugglers a product to sell; we  really will send illegal arrivals by boat offshore to places like Manus and Nauru for processing and it won’t  just be one in ten or one in 20, they’ll all go off; we will reserve the option of turning boats around where  it’s safe to do so, and let’s face it the Sri Lankan Navy is doing that now with boats that are leaving that  country; and, finally and very importantly, John, we will rebuild our relationship with Indonesia which sadly  this Government has trashed through things like the live cattle export ban and the megaphone diplomacy  over the Oceanic Viking. A very large percentage of people who come to this country illegally by boat  transit via Indonesia and we do need a strong relationship with Indonesia if this horrible, tragic flow is going  to stop.

JOHN SHAW:

Alright, Tony. Great to catch up with you again and I look forward to doing so between now and the 14th of  September.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, thank you, John, and if I may, the message I’ve got for the voters of New England is if they want to  change the Government, they’ve got to change their local member. Regardless of the fact that Tony Windsor  over the years has certainly been a canny politician, if you want to change the Government, you’ve got to  change the local member in New England.

JOHN SHAW:

Alright. Thanks, Tony.

TONY ABBOTT:

Thanks so much, John.
