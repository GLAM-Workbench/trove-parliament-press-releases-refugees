Taskforce Response Raises Questions

Â

“I am surprised that the option of creating a highly visible, dedi cated 
coast guard, to send a clear message to people traffickers and organised 
crime overseas has been ruled out,” Shadow Justice and Customs Minister, 
Duncan Kerr, said today.

Â

“Senator Vanstone claims this was because of cost. 
The Opposition is sceptical of this claim given the cost the community 
will be carrying to deal with illegal immigrants, drugs and quarantine.

Â

“The Opposition notes the Government’s initiative 
to increase funding to existing agencies and to better coordinate between 
them, however talk of major increases in funding is illusionary,” 
Mr Kerr said.

Â

The Opposition will cooperate and be constructive 
in its response to these new measures. However more remains to be done 
to develop a comprehensive solution.

Â

“The new funding amount is largely a ‘robbing 
Peter to pay Paul’ exercise. The Federal Government is again repackaging 
funding it slashed in previous years.

Â

“While the additional funding to Coastwatch is welcomed, 
if the funds for many of the agencies involved in coastal surveillance 
had not been cut in the first place, the Federal Government would probably 
not be in this mess.

Â

“This year has seen 27 illegal boats arrive carrying 
hundreds of illegal immigrants, risking lives and costing Australian 
taxpayers millions.

Â

“The arrivals have highlighted weaknesses in Australia’s 
coastal defences and demonstrated how quickly the nation’s resources 
are stretched beyond capacity.

Â

“Some significant damage has already been done to 
our international reputation,” Mr Kerr said.
