MISSION TO STUDY HUMANITARIAN NEEDS

IN WEST AND EAST TIMOR

Â

Â

Officials from the Australian Government’s overseas aid agency, 
AusAID, will visit West and East Timor this  week to assess the 
current humanitarian situation, particularly as it affects internally 
displaced people.

Â

The AusAID officials will meet with provincial authorities 
in Kupang (West Timor) as well as district authorities in the West/East 
Timor border area where many IDPs are reported to have gathered. They 
will also have discussions with local communities and non-government 
organisations, as well as representatives of UNAMET, the United Nations 
High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) and the International Committee 
of the Red Cross (ICRC), along with other agencies involved in providing 
relief assistance to IDPs and others.

Â

The problem of malaria was raised during my recent 
visit, and I have asked the AusAID mission to identify other activities 
that Australia could support to tackle the disease. Up to 150 UNAMET 
staff have been affected. Australia has already provided supplies of 
Doxycycline for UNAMET personnel as part of medical kits as well as 
individual mosquito nets.

Â

The AusAID mission will review current arrangements 
within UNAMET for the screening, diagnosis and treatment of malaria 
amongst UN staff and, if appropriate, make specific recommendations 
for additional Australian support.

Â

The health sector is a key component of the Australian 
Government’s development cooperation program for East Timor, and a 
number of planned initiatives will assist more broadly with malaria 
care and prevention in the future, particularly in rural areas.

Â

This mission is part of Australia’s continuing program 
of assistance to the people of East Timor in the lead-up to the ballot 
at the end of this month on East Timor’ s future status. Australia 
has already provided relief assistance to internally displaced people 
to the value of $500,000 through Caritas and local non-government organisations 
following an assessment mission in March this year. This has assisted 
some 11,000 people.

Â

More recently, $176,000 was provided to an Indonesian 
NGO, the Kalyanamitra Foundation, for relief assistance to IDPs. In 
addition, three vehicles have just been shipped for use by the United 
Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) as part of their assistance 
program for displaced persons.
