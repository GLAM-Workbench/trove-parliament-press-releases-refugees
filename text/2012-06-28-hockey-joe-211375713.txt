PRESENTER:

The Shadow Treasurer joins me now from Canberra. Mr Hockey, good morning to you. This  is close to your heart I know; your father came to Australia as a refugee from Palestine in  the late 40s. Tell me about your thoughts on this issue.

JOE HOCKEY:

Ben, we had a policy that was in place that worked to stop the boats, it involved three parts.  Number one, offshore processing of applications and in the case of Nauru only 40% ended  up in Australia, about 30% ended up overseas and 30% went back to countries from which  they came. Secondly, we had Temporary Protection Visas which said that if you get here  you are not guaranteed permanent residency at any rate and thirdly where possible we turn  back the boats. That was working, it stopped the boats. The Government chose it. They  have had numerous different policies and now they are offering a people swap with  Malaysia that would see the most vulnerable people, children that have come under our  guardianship being sent to a country that has a very poor record in the treatment of  refugees. Frankly, I will not support it. The Coalition will not support it. It will fail. It is bad  policy trying to solve a bad political situation for the Government.

PRESENTER:

It has become all very urgent considering what is going on at the moment. Yesterday off  Christmas Island and the other boat capsizing a week earlier, although it has been two  years in to making, hasn't it? Julia Gillard, when she became Prime Minister, said she  would fix it two years ago, she could have adopted Nauru. Let's go to where we are today.  You look at the headlines - ‘lives not politics’. You are in the situation today Joe Hockey

and also Tony Abbott as the Opposition Leader where you can come up with a deal today,  you can - the Coalition Senators can allow this Bill to go through which would have offshore  processing - so if offshore processing is the answer why not just cop this deal even if it is  not the one you wanted?

JOE HOCKEY:

Offshore processing is part of the answer. But dumping people in another country and  accepting from that country, being Malaysia, five refugees for every one that is dumped  there is a bad outcome and it is limited to 800. It will not stop the boats. The bottom line is  that you have to have a package, a package that involves basically stopping the boats from  coming by saying that the boat traffickers, the people traffickers, have no product because  the people you try to sell Australia to are not guaranteed the right of passage to Australia.  Now that is what we have said. For some reason, for hubris, for political gain, for political  expediency, the Government does not want to go back to a policy that worked. Give it a go.  If the same policy does not work again, then come up with other solutions, offer others but  do not turn your back on something that worked.

PRESENTER:

You talk about the need for a package. Part of the Coalition's package is the idea you  would actually tow back boats where it is safe to do so. Indonesia says forget about it, it is  not going to happen. With all the passion that was, quite obviously, in your voice and heart  last night in Parliament, would you also say that is not the way to be towing back boats in  the middle of the ocean?

JOE HOCKEY:

It is where it is possible. Sometimes it is still possible, very close to the shore of another  country, you have got to come to agreements.

PRESENTER:

Do you have concerns about that aspect of your policy?

JOE HOCKEY:

No, because it is a significant threat and it is where possible. I mean obviously the most  significant example of a boat not being able to land in Australia is the Tampa episode which  arguably was the start of the whole Pacific Solution process but I just say to you, Ben, this  is not easy. This is not easy. But you have to have consistent principles here. Our  consistent principles are the most humane thing you can do is stop the boats and have  offshore processing together with Temporary Protection Visas. That is the solution.

PRESENTER:

Let’s have a quick listen to what Prime Minister Julia Gillard said to Georgie a little earlier.

JULIA GILLARD:

The arrangement that went through the House of Representatives yesterday combines a  key element of the Government's policy, the arrangement with Malaysia, with a key element  of the opposition's policy, having a detention centre in Nauru. This is genuinely an attempt  the end the politics, to have a true compromise and sitting here now this is the only Bill that  has the option of passing the Parliament today. This is the only Bill that is before the  Senate.

PRESENTER:

She is right about that, isn't she? Mr Hockey, this is the only one that has a possibility of  going through today but the Coalition is going to say no to it.

JOE HOCKEY:

We offered a Bill yesterday. Julia Gillard ran down to the House and grabbed the Bill of an  independent. You will remember that Julia Gillard said she would introduce Government  legislation and dare us to vote against it in the Parliament. She never introduced that  legislation, she never had the courage to do that. Instead, yesterday when she heard we  were introducing a Bill to facilitate the processing of refugees in over 147 countries offshore  - when she heard about that she ran down to the House and grabbed a Bill that had been  sitting there, sitting on the papers for more than six months - she grabbed that and said,  "We have to pass this urgently". If this is the case, why didn't she do that on Monday, if she  believed in that Bill? Why hasn’t she done it previously? That is the thing.
