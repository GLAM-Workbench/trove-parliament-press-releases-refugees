"AUSTRALIAN FOREIGN POLICY IN THE 1990'S :

THE NECESSITY OF CHOICE"

Address by Dr John Hewson MP  Leader of the Federal Opposition  to the Australian Institute of International Affairs

I am very pleased to have this opportunity to address the Institute for the first time  as Leader of the Opposition.

I am well aware of the Institute's important and constructive role over fifty seven  years in generating an informed community debate in Australia on international  issues. At this time of historic change in world affairs, that role of the Institute is  more necessary than ever. I am therefore delighted to be with you today to discuss

some alternative options for Australian foreign policy.

In just over two weeks, it will be six months since my election as Leader of the  Opposition. In my previous careers as a domestic and international bureaucrat,  Professor of Economics, government adviser, banker and Shadow Treasurer, I  became well acquainted with international economic developments and I travelled  and worked extensively in North America, Europe and particularly in the Asia-  Pacific region.

As Leader of the Opposition, of course, my international perspectives have  necessarily broadened.

Over recent months, I have met in Australia with a number of visiting Heads of  Government and Ministers.

In July, I undertook the most extensive regional visit ever by a Coalition Opposition  Leader. I visited eight countries in the Asia-Pacific region. In each country I met  very senior ministers and business leaders. I especially valued my meetings with  various Heads of Government including President Aquino, Prime Minister Lee Kuan  Yew, President Suharto and Prime Minister Namaliu.

Tomorrow, ! begin a trip to Japan, China and Hong Kong.

Since my election as Leader, I have been determined not just to comment sensibly  on day-to-day issues that affect Australian foreign policy but to reflect more broadly  on how the dramatic international changes over the past six months are affecting  Australia's international interests and how as a country we should best pursue them.

The Institute today provides me with a very appropriate forum to outline some of  the main features of the Coalition's view of Australia's role in a rapidly changing  world.

Sixteen years ago, this Institute's Annual Conference addressed itself to the  question: "Advance Australia - Where?". In 1974 that question was a most topical  one. It was a time of great international change dominated by superpower detente,

the impact of the first oil shock and rising aspirations in the Third World.

Today I want to suggest to you that in 1990, even more than in 1974, we need to  take stock of where our foreign policy is heading and what we want from it. We  need to address again the question: "Advance Australia - Where?".

2

The changes we have witnessed in world affairs over the past year or two are even  more dramatic and significant than those of the early 1970's. In focussing on what  those changes mean for the priorities of Australian foreign policy in the 1990's, I  want to address three specific questions today:

(i) What will characterise the international and regional environment of  the 1990's in which Australian foreign policy will have to operate?

(ii) Is current Australian foreign policy appropriate in such an

environment?

(iii) Is there a better alternative?

The International Environment of the 1990's

The recent end of the Cold War has signalled the beginning of a new phase in  international relations: one that is more complex but less ideological, more  integrated but less hierarchical than that which characterised the post-war era.

In the battle of ideas that lasted for over four decades, the liberal democratic  capitalism of the West has clearly prevailed over Eastern Bloc communism.

This outcome of the Cold War is not a cause for gloating or smug self-satisfaction  in Western countries. The real challenge for policy makers is to manage its  consequences productively, rather than to be involved in endless debates about its  causes.

But if the wrong lessons are learned from the outcome of the Cold War, the  possibilities for peaceful progress in the new era we are entering will not be  maximised.

And let there be no mistake : there are those, in Australia and elsewhere, who are  trying to re-write the history of the Cold War and to distort why it ended as it did.

The Cold War was a battle of ideas as well as a battle of wills.

In the battle of ideas, Western democratic liberalism has proved clearly superior to  communist centralisation. It has done so because, as an economic and political force,  Western democratic liberalism respects individual liberty, maximises individual  opportunity and achieves practical economic results.

Around the world, hopes for economic progress are now linked firmly with the idea  of political freedom. And that is the real measure of the failure of communism.

In the battle of wills, Western consistency and strength has also clearly prevailed.

In that victory, there has been no single cause.

3

The personality of Gorbachev, the courage of dissidents within the Soviet Union,  and the nationalist resentments within Eastern Europe all contributed to the  European revolution of 1989.

But fundamental to the historic changes we have seen has been the effectiveness of  Western strategies of containment and deterrence.

To an important extent, the outcome of the Cold War was the result of the  consistency of purpose with which Western countries signalled to the Soviet Union  and others that their ideological and territorial expansionism would be actively  resisted.

Put simply the strategies of containment and deterrence have proved remarkably  successful.

That is one of the real lessons of the Cold War.

It is a lesson which may be unpalatable to past critics of those strategies (including  many in Australia) who consistently portrayed them as mistaken, provocative and  doomed to fail. But it serves no useful purpose to pretend that the Western policy  of "peace through strength" didn't really matter in deciding the final outcome. The  fact is that it has been indispensable in deciding how the Cold War ended as it did.

It is a lesson which will remain relevant in the post-Cold War era. The aggressive  expansionism of Iraq is the first test case. Iraq's designs will only be successfully  resisted if the international community makes it clear, in military and economic  terms, that such aggression will be resisted.

In our own region, the Asia-Pacific region, the hallmark of the post-Cold War era  will be the primacy of economic factors in the foreign policy of regional countries.

During my July trip through Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, Thailand,  Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia and Papua New Guinea, my enduring impression  was the extent to which economic motives are now driving regional foreign policy.

Those regional countries are single-mindedly determined to improve their already  impressive economic growth performances and to expand their economic horizons.  They are doing so under the driving force of economic policies aimed at nonÂ­ inflationary growth, open markets, deregulation, privatisation, structural efficiency,

productivity and foreign investment.

Some examples highlight this fact.

. the Soviet Union and South Korea are examining economic initiatives in  Siberia

. after over two decades of diplomatic isolation, Indonesia and the People's  Republic of China have resumed diplomatic relations

4

. Singapore and China will soon do the same

. Thailand, recognising its close economic interests in Indo-China, is closely  involving itself with developments there

. Japan and the Soviet Union are exploring new political and economic  initiatives

. Indonesia has adopted impressive policies of economic modernisation over  recent years.

One of the deep impressions that was made on me during my Asian trip was the  extent to which Australia's influence in the region has become marginalised both  because of our relatively poor economic performance and because we are so widely  seen as being slow and partial in responding to these economic forces of change  sweeping the Asia-PacifiÃ¢ÂÂc region - a theme to which I will return later.

Australian Foreign Policy in the 1990's

The second question I wish to address today concerns the state of Australia's foreign  policy at the present time.

For the first time in a generation, Australians face the possibility of choice in their  foreign policy. With the withering away of the comfortable, if high-risk, certainties  of the Cold War era, many of the realities that underpinned our foreign policy for  so long have disappeared as well.

Now we face a new world in which the advancement of Australia's interests poses  fundamentally new challenges and dangers.

There is another important reason why we must face up to the realities of  international change. Australian foreign policy has currently lost its way.

This is not to say that the Government and the Opposition share no common ground  on foreign policy issues. We obviously do, including on some fundamental issues like  the US alliance, the Gulf crisis, the UN and more.

But what we do maintain is that Australia's foreign policy is currently confused.

In its rhetoric, the Government's foreign policy seeks the best of every world : more  security, more economic growth, more interdependence, more respect for the  sovereignty of states, more emphasis on international organisations, stronger  alliances, better protection of human rights, and the list goes on.

This wish list is admirable in theory but it ignores the fact that in practice a country  like Australia, with its limited diplomatic and economic influence, must confront the  necessity of choice in many of these matters.

5

The result is that Australian foreign policy currently lacks a clear sense of what national interests it should be serving. And, perhaps even more importantly, it lacks a clear sense of what our priorities among those interests should be.

The evidence of the disarray in Australian foreign policy is all around us:

. first, Australia's serious economic problems, which are largely of our own  making, are undermining our relevance to, and our credibility with, the  dynamic economies of the Asia-Pacific region;

- wherever I visit in Asia the story is the same: our bilateral trade,  especially in manufacturing, tourism, banking, education and other  services, has only scratched the surface of its potential; and bilateral  investment is modest;

- the reason is a simple one: our labour market is too centralised, our  infrastructure too inefficient and deficient, our recent economic  management is totally misguided, and our export culture is too stifled  to allow Australia to participate fully in regional economic growth;

- the result is also a simple one: Australia's capacity for constructive  economic and political influence in our region is declining significantly;

. second, our foreign policy has suffered from being reduced to the politics of  personality and mateship. Over recent years we have deluded ourselves that  what are marketed as "close" personal relationships between leaders can  somehow substitute for genuine relationships built up over time and hardÂ­ headed assessments of what we, as a nation, should be seeking out of a  bilateral relationship. Nothing epitomises this fact better than this

Government's wild swings in its policy towards China;

. third, our regional policy is also in disarray. For example, among Pacific  island countries and in particular with two of the most important to  Australia, namely Fiji and PNG, Australia's scope for constructive influence  has declined significantly over recent years

. fourth, Australian foreign policy is currently managed in a way that is too  closely linked to domestic political advantage:

- the case of Cambodia provides a good example;

- The Australian Government has made some constructive contribution  to the peace process and we in the Opposition have recognised and  welcomed it;

- but it is a delusion for the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister to  indulge in an exercise of self-congratulation about the recent  breakthrough in Cambodia;

6

- the real driving force behind recent developments has been the UN Permanent Five

: in a speech to the Foreign Correspondents Association in Singapore in July I spelt out the converging interests of the P5  in brokering a settlement

: several countries like Indonesia and Australia have played a supporting role in the P5 process that subsequently evolved

: but Australia's high profile role, however, has been limited in its potential because of the Government's political relationship with  China, a country which has been the key to a Cambodian  settlement

: to pretend, therefore, that Australia has been the central driving force of the peace process is a delusion of grandeur for domestic  political consumption.

. fifth, our immigration policy, particularly our refugee policy, is confused and  unfair. The annual immigration intake is the outcome of a series of deals  with various lobby groups and not of a rational, cost-benefit decision making  process. And as the case of the Chinese students highlighted, our refugee  policy has become the victim of the emotional and inconsistent application of  established refugee criteria to serve particular political purposes;

. sixth, in Defence policy, there is similar disarray. The recent tendency to cut  defence spending and the current Budget's provision for zero real growth in  Defence spending mean that the much vaunted 1987 Defence White Paper is  now a white elephant. The Government has consistently shown that it  simply cannot meet the minimal financial requirements that the White Paper  itself laid down for its implementation and we remain locked into some very  large equipment purchases over the next several years

. seventh, Australia's policy on defence arms exports is proving counterÂ­ productive to our foreign policy objectives. This fact is demonstrated by the  recent sale of Mirage jet fighters to Pakistan and the proposed sale to Iraq of  aircraft spare parts just prior to the imposition of UN sanctions;

. eighth, our foreign aid program is still not effectively targeted to meet the  needs of the world's poorest; it is still spread too thinly across more than 100  countries; and it can be targeted more effectively in our own region

In summary, we need clearer priorities in Australian foreign policy and we need to  pursue them more consistently. We need a new course in Australian foreign policy  partly to adjust to changing international realities and partly to overcome the  increasingly obvious inadequacies in the way our international interests are

currently being pursued.

7

An Alternative

My third question relates to a viable alternative.

Today I want to spell out what the Federal Opposition believes should be the  guiding principles of a new course for Australian foreign policy.

On previous occasions I have described our approach as one driven by "enlightened  self-interest". Today I wish to outline our purpose in more detail.

In designing its foreign policy, any nation must address the following issues:

. what is its concept of national security, or in more practical terms, what  international changes is it prepared to resist?

. what are the goals it wants to achieve?

. what resources are available for either of these purposes?

The history of Australian foreign policy shows that in seeking to address these  central issues we have oscillated between extremes.

At times, our foreign policy has been defence - dominated, driven by fears of our  vastness, our vulnerability and our relative isolation.

At other times, we have pursued a foreign policy of overblown ambition pursuing  initiatives in international diplomacy that are unrelated to our real national  interests and limited international resources.

A foreign policy of enlightened self-interest is not something especially novel. It is  something which countries such as France, West Germany, Sweden, Japan, the  ASEAN nations, and many others have actively pursued for decades.

Some critics maintain that a foreign policy of "enlightened self interest" makes  foreign policy nothing more than an extension of domestic economic policy.

That view is fundamentally mistaken. It neglects the important security and  humanitarian factors that remain relevant to any viable national foreign policy.

Such factors include the importance of our security relationships with the United  States and Asia-Pacific countries. They include the need for balanced, verifiable and  stabilising arms control reductions. They also include humanitarian issues such as  our refugee program and aid in major disaster situations. On issues such as these,  the Government and Opposition are united on ends even if we may differ on the best  means of achieving them.

8

A foreign policy of enlightened self-interest takes account of these issues. But it also  takes account of the changes necessary in Australian foreign policy in an era when  economic bargaining will increasingly drive power diplomacy.

An Australian foreign policy of "enlightened self-interest" would entail some  significant changes from the focus and direction of existing policies.

First, there needs to be a closer interaction between our domestic and our foreign  policies.

Australia needs to recognise that its capacity to influence international developments  constructively will be increasingly related to its economic strength and potential.

Let me put this point quite bluntly. We are no longer the diplomatic and economic  force we were in the Asia-Pacific region because our relative economic situation has  declined considerably leaving us in our current vulnerable and precarious position.

I have made it clear that restoring Australia's position as a leading diplomatic and  economic force in our region by the year 2000 is the objective of the next Coalition  Government. And, working back from that goal, we are developing detailed policies  to achieve it.

Our foreign policy will only once again be truly influential and respected when we  put our own economic house in order. That means reducing our record foreign debt,  bringing down our rate of inflation, realising our export potential and achieving real  reforms in our economic infrastructure.

Australia's current serious economic situation demands that these objectives be the  primary goal of both our foreign and domestic policies.

Second, our trade policy must reflect more clearly what our export industries need  if they are to achieve and maintain a high level of competitiveness.

That is why the next Coalition Government has committed itself to phased and  predictable reductions in protection levels so that by the Year 2000 they will be, at  most, negligible.

We will achieve this target on the basis of the sweeping industry reform we will  undertake in the labour market, telecommunications, the waterfront, coastal  shipping and land transport, as well as the comprehensive privatisation and tax

reform programs we have outlined.

Australia's purpose in international trade negotiations must have a more practical  edge related to a clear, hard-headed idea of what we as a nation want out of them.

For example, the Government's Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation (APEC)  initiative is a worthwhile one which the Opposition has supported.

9

But we must set clear objectives in areas such as trade liberalisation and investment  and exchanges of data against which the value of such an initiative for Australia can  be measured over time.

The APEC initiative must also be pursued in much greater co-operation with the  Australian private sector if it is to maximise practical benefits for Australia rather  than develop as another government forum for exchanging data and views.

Similarly, in the Uruguay Round of Global Trade Negotiations, Australia should  make it abundantly clear that no agreement is preferable to a bad agreement and  that a bad agreement is one that does not achieve progress on farm subsidies and  agricultural protection.

The Coalition Parties took the lead some time ago on this issue. We called for  Australia to lobby hard in the Cairns Group and with other countries to endorse a  position of linking progress in the Uruguay Round negotiations on trade in services

and intellectual property rights with progress in the negotiations on agriculture.

We have welcomed the fact that the Australian Government subsequently adopted  such an approach and we will be urging it to continue to maintain as much pressure  as possible for reform of world agricultural trade.

Let me give a specific example. Next week I will be having discussions in Tokyo, as  will the Prime Minister, with senior Japanese Government figures. I will be urging  the Japanese to take a leading role in breaking the current logjam in the Uruguay

Round. I will be emphasising to them the benefits that would flow in this regard  from the liberalisation of Japan's rice trade.

I hope that the Prime Minister will be doing the same.

Third, Australian efforts to promote democratic change and to improve compliance  with internationally recognised standards of human rights must be conducted with  greater skill and consistency. They must also be promoted with greater awareness  that the spread of democracy and the better protection of human rights must be

carefully integrated with other concerns that are vital Australian international  interests.

Taking the moral high ground in international affairs always runs the risk of being  left isolated and without any gains to show for the moral position adopted. In this,  as in so many areas of foreign policy, the issues are those of balance and method of

making the point.

Current Australian foreign policy has lost this sense of proper balance because it has  no sense of its own priorities. The result has been that Australia over recent years  has been pursuing democratic and human rights standards in some particular  countries in a single-minded way that is counter productive to Australia's broader

national interests.

10

Our relationship with Fiji provides one example. Fiji is an important country for  Australia. It is a significant partner for Australia in trade and investment. It is an  important focal point for many regional activities in the South Pacific.

Yet, Mr Hawke has managed to offend the leaders of both major political groupings  on Fiji. He has done so through a series of contradictory statements and actions  that have squandered the constructive, co-operative influence which Australia could  have.

For Australia to sit in judgement in what it deems to be "acceptable" constitutional  change in Fiji and to make our bilateral relationship conditional on such change  being implemented by Fiji has been counter-productive to our national, bilateral and  regional interests.

Australian policy would have better served those interests if it had pursued a  different emphasis - namely, the building of political consensus for the reÂ­ establishment of Fiji's liberal democracy.

The proposed new Fijian constitution does not provide for a liberal democratic form  of government. But it does have considerable support within the indigenous Fijian  community. Furthermore, liberal democracy can only be built on a common  community commitment to the constitutional protection of individual rights and  such commitment is not currently established in Fiji.

Australian policy needs to understand those realities. Australia's interests are best  served not by setting standards and passing judgement, but by promoting dialogue  for the development of support for democracy from all communities in Fiji.

Otherwise, we will see a repeat of what has happened. The Fijian Government has  largely given up on Australia in key areas of its policy and it is now negotiating  other countries, such as China, to take our place.

Our relations with South Africa provide another example of the unreality of current  Australian policy.

Australian policy has failed to keep pace with the historic changes occurring in  South Africa. President de Klerk is showing considerable courage in the changes he  is making. The African National Congress is also following the path of compromise  with its recent renunciation of violence - a course of action, by the way, which the

Hawke Government did nothing to encourage.

Australian policy needs to recognise these changing realities in South Africa. Our  sanctions policy is outdated and based on a selective morality. It should be eased  to provide incentives for further compromise and peaceful change.

11

Current Australian policy on aviation links provides an important opportunity to  provide such an incentive. Qantas should be free to determine its flight schedule to  South Africa on the basis of its commercial judgement, and not Australian  Government direction.

A further example is Australia's relationship with China.

This time next week I will be in China. I will be there because, unlike the  Government, the Opposition believes that the cause Of human rights in China, as  well as the prospects for our bilateral economic relationship, are best served by  taking our concerns and our hopes directly to the senior Chinese political leadership.

We must have the courage of our convictions on this issue.

We cannot go on deluding ourselves that the human rights situation in China will  change only if we continue to refuse to make our views known directly to China's  leadership.

We cannot go on pretending that there is some kind of choice between developing  economic relations with the People's Republic of China and developing those with  Taiwan. We can, and must, develop both. Other countries have done so for years  to their benefit while Australia has denied itself for no useful purpose.

Fourth, we need a more sensible balance between internationalism and regionalism  in our foreign policy.

We need to recognise that our security and prosperity are directly affected by global  developments and in particular by changes in the global balance of military and  economic power.

That is why Australia's current involvement in the international community's  response to the Gulf crisis is a proper one.

And that is why what happens in the Uruguay Round or the international monetary  system is so important for Australian interests.

We cannot, therefore, afford to become "regional isolationists" pretending that our  interests are defined by strict geographic limits. ,

But, at the same time, we must realise that in terms of using our limited  international influence or extending our economic opportunities or developing our  defence capabilities, we need to have a special focus of involvement with the Asia-  Pacific region.

That is why I emphasise that the goal of making Australia a major political and  economic force in the Asia-Pacific region by the Year 2000 should drive our national  policy making process.

12

That is why I have called for a 'Year of Asia" in Australia to increase mutual  awareness, to highlight trade and investment opportunities, and to broaden  educational, youth and other personal contacts.

And that is why it is fundamentally important that our relations with key regional  countries such as Indonesia and PNG are productive and predictable. In particular,  the future stability of PNG is a vital regional issue. This point was put very  forcefully to me by Indonesian Defence Minister Moerdani during my recent  discussions in Jakarta with him. It is a priority which Australian policy cannot  ignore.

Fifth, our foreign aid program must be more directly related to our national  interests in providing such aid. And those interests essentially are to help meet the  needs of the world's poor and to help build more effective bilateral relationships in  our own region.

Our current aid program is too diversified to achieve maximum effect. It is also not  effectively targeted on the most needy. In fact, in the recent Budget, the Government  cut food aid in real terms.

Our foreign aid program needs to have clearer priorities in terms of enhancing our  bilateral relationships in our region. And those priorities need to be pursued more  consistently in particular areas.

. We need to make our aid program with Indonesia more stable and

predictable.

Australia has failed to confirm an amount for its aid program commitment for  the year commencing 1 July 1990. Although multi-year commitments are  given for aid programs in many other countries, the Australian Government  has never made such a commitment for Indonesia.

This situation has delayed major projects and provided an irritant in the  bilateral relationship which is difficult to reconcile with its importance.

. We need to give greater priority to helping PNG to develop an institutional  basis for managing more tied aid programs.

The Australian Government is planning to rapidly increase such programs.  It is doing so despite the warning from the PNG Finance Minister and  Foreign Minister that PNG's capacity for managing such tied aid needs to be

more fully developed.

We believe that this more concentrated targeting of our foreign aid program should  be achieved without any need to increase Australia's total foreign aid budget.

Conclusion

I referred earlier to this Institute's 1974 Conference on the theme of "Advance  Australia - Where?" At that Conference, one of this Institute's most eminent  members, the late Professor Hedley Bull, spoke of the then Labor Government's  foreign policy as a "policy of rhetorical gestures". He referred to the "gap between

its words and its actions, between its moral professions and what it is actually  prepared to do".

I want to suggest to you today that the current Labor Government is pursuing a  similar foreign policy of "rhetorical gestures".

Its foreign policy has been based too much on mistaken views of personal  relationships, too much on domestic political considerations, too much on grand  gestures and too little on a clear view of how Australia's longer term international  interests can be most effectively advanced.

I have outlined today what I believe should be the guiding principles of a new course  in Australian foreign policy.

The challenge for Australian foreign policy in the 1990's is to assess accurately the  powerful forces of change in international affairs and to manage them productively  in Australia's interest.

Our foreign policy can achieve more in pursuing that goal if it aims to do less, and  does it better.

A Coalition Government will do so with vision and compassion, but above all, with  a clear sense of Australia's interests.
