AS BAN-AUSTRAL1A FORUM

The following is the text of the speech delivered \  by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Andrew Peacock, at the  opening of the ASEAN-Australia Forum on 30 October 1978 in : Canberra o -  ,  ,

"Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen : -  '

I am delighted to welcome you to Australia and to  Canberra for the fourth meeting of the ASEAN-Australia  ForumÂ» As well as being the arena for dealing seriously and  substantively with the important issues before you, I hope

the Forum will give' you the opportunity to renew old ,

acquaintances, and share hospitalityÂ» ’

The first meeting of this kind was in Bangkok in 1974, It marked the beginning of an era for both Australia and ASEAN= We in Australia1  were particularly pleased to establish such a  relationship with ASEAN,1  and we look back with satisfaction on

the achievements of the intervening four yearsÂ» Australia and  ASEAN have grown together in experience and in trust, in building  a structure of cooperative contacts of value to us allÂ» At the '   same time, I offer ASEAN my congratulations on its own remarkable

achievements since its 'formation in 1967, in maturing into a  cohesive and confident regional organisation, intent on finding  its own distinctive role in the region, overcoming the disparities  of history, tradition, race and culture,  and turning the

similarities of" common purpose to the benefit of all the people  of the regionÂ» The proof of the success of ASEAN can be measured  by the continually increasing international interest and support  that it is attractingÂ» Ã¢ÂÂ Â· Ã¢ÂÂ

Australia, as one of the nearest neighbours to the  ASEAN region, recognises' the substantial area of mutual interest  with your'Association-Â» We have much in common with the objectives  towards which ASEAN is workingÂ» We, like ASEAN, have increasingly

acknowledged the priority of economic relationships in interÂ­ national affairs'Â» We'share with ASEAN, and with developing  countries generally, a concern about world trade in commodities,  particularly agricultural commoditiesÂ» To this end Australia

has been working actively to achieve’a*viable and well-managed  Common FundÂ» '"We^^ill^ continue to do .'everything we can to z'':   assist in br4hgihg'"Â§Botit agreement betweenÂ·, the developed and  developing world on this important .issueÂ»

We know from our own experience,  as does ASEAN,  the damage to export earnings and growth prospects caused  by instability in commodity prices and markets. We are  therefore also working towards improvements in internationally

negotiated trading arrangements. To the extent, that these are  achieved we shall have the opportunity to become a stronger  and more vigorous trading partner in the region. If we  can achieve this we Should be better able to widen the basis of  our economic relationships in keeping with the dynamic process  of change which is taking place in our region.

In a situation of rapid economic change, one of  Australia's foremost tasks,  and one which we acknowledge as  requiring oUr greatest efforts and concentration, is to  relate by r own circumstances to this dynamic process of

growth. We regard the choices Which we Will be making in  balancing and expanding bur" relationships with' ASEAN economies .as one of the central issues facing us in the coming decade.

I have said this time and again. Many'more Australians .... are also coming to accept it. Indeed it has now become a  constant theme for many of our editorial writers and in the  main their stress is correct.

Already we can see the signs that expansion and  balance is beginnning to take place. The Australian Government  is particularly conscious that this process should be maintained  and it is taking positive steps to help its continuation. One

example alone is the staging of the ASEAN Trade Fair in Sydney  last week. This Fair successfully provided a 'showcase for  companies from the ASEAN countries to present new products to  both the Australian trade and public and to promote further  products already marketed in Australia. As well, and this  is very important, it gave the ASEAN exporters a chance to  obtain a better appreciation of the Australian market and to  gauge personally its particular requirements. The Fair was  a practical measure towards increasing trade between ASEAN and  Australia. Â·  Ã¢ÂÂ   ‘

Ã¢ÂÂ   Having said that it is only realistic to remind  you that it is inevitable in the circumstances of international  economic restraints, and with ASEAN's expanding capabilities,   that we will encounter and have to cope with competitive

situations from time to time in areas of production and commerce  upon which the livelihood of a considerable number of Australians  has traditionally depended. '  -

The aim must be to get as close as we all can to the

problem, to canvass together all the issues and to form a  realistic appreciation of how we can accommodate our mutual  needs. If we work in this way and tackle the issues facing

us without shirking the difficulties,  our efforts will  be rewarded with success,,

For Australia1s part we wish to see an intensification  and development of the relationship with ASEAN. It is clearly  in our mutual interest to.capitalise on the advances which  have been made so far, to broaden them and to maintain the  momentum of new initiativesÂ»

From the beginning of the ASEAN-Australia economic  cooperation" program, we have been committed to working  together in a direct and practical way to agreed objectives. The Protein Project and the Food Handling Project, the first

to be undertaken under this program by ASEAN' experts themselves,  with support from Australia, have achieved remarkable success'. The technological progress' made and the research which has  produced results of direct application to the situation in each

ASEAN country, have been gratifying to us all. An additional  benefit, the extent of which was perhaps unforeseen at the  time when the projects began, is the habit of contact between

ASEAN food technologists themselves, and between them and their  Australian counterparts. This has now become second nature. We will be considering at this meeting extensions and expansions,  to the Protein and Food Handling Projects, some of which are

already in the process of implementation and others which  may be added to the Projects in the future.

Other project proposals originally submitted by ASEAN  to Australia included the ASEAN Centre of Appropriate Technology,  which is now to be known as the ASEAN Materials Handling Bureau.  We have such a Bureau in Australia, and it has built up a

level of expertise which should provide a useful complement to  the work being done under the Protein and Food Handling Projects.

in addition, a regional education project has been  under discussion among ASEAN educationists, and a Regional  Co-ordinating Committee has been formed for this purpose.  Australia remains willing to consider ASEAN's agreed project  proposal in this field When it is ready.

Cooperative activities between ASEAN and Australia have  proceeded apace with these economic cooperation projects. Since the last meeting of this Forum at Solo in May 1977, and  since the post-Summit meeting, at Kuala Lumpur between the  Australian Prime Minister and the ASEAN Heads of Governments,  we have taken a number of measures in fulfilment of our ,

undertakings over a wide range of fields.

We have agreed to improve Australia/ASEAN consultative  arrangements on trade. Discussion of the procedures is approachÂ­ ing finality and, I hope, can be concluded promptly.

In another measure designed to stimulate greater  Australian investment interest in the region,  w e ,  in June 1978,  sponsored an >Industrial Cooperation Conference in Melbourne, It was  attended by leading ASEAN members of the government and the  private sector,  and proved successful in bringing them

together with Australians with a close business interest in  ASEAN. We hope to consider with ASEAN further measuies to  follow up this promising beginning.

It was largely in recognition of the problems that  would have been caused in regard to Australian investment in  ASEAN countries that the .Government decided not to proceed with  legislation to broaden the basis of.taxation of foreign earned

incomes; In discussions on this matter with my colleagues, I have been very conscious of this difficulty.

;  Another new development,  as I mentioned earlier,  was the ASEAN Trade Fair. During this meeting we will be seeking  your views on further possibilities for trade promotion. I see this as an important part of your work.

At Kuala Lumpur,  Australia offered to contribute in  several possible ways to the agreed ASEAN regional industrial  cooperation projects. As these become identified, Australia  could contribute feasibility studies, technical assistance,  design and construction and infrastructure development.

The Australia Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime  Minister, and I have taken, and will continue to take, every  appropriate opportunity to visit ASEAN countries. Furthermore,  when I was in New York earlier this month for the United Nations

General Assembly I had as regularly in the past worthwhile  discussions with ASEAN Foreign Ministers. I am looking forward  to the occasion when they can visit Australia.

As part of our assessment of the importance of a  closer mutual understanding of the economic relationship,  we are discussing with ASEAN a Joint Research Project, aimed  at establishing a sound basis of knowledge upon which the

long-term economic relationship between ASEAN and Australia can  be developed. We see this as promising important benefits for  us ail and"'Would like to see it established as soon as possible.

My colleagues and I in Government see opportunities  for broader liaison between businessmen in ASEAN and Australia,  which could have considerableimutual benefit in ensuring 1   continuing contact and in producing new avenues for economic

activity. We would welcome the early establishment of formal  links bietween the ASEAN Chambers of Commerce and Industry and  the Confederation of Australian Industry. ,

I have sought to present to you a very brief outline  on the ASEAN-Australia relationship,  and suggestions for a  program of action to take us from here to the next Forum, The Australian Government looks to you for an indication of  your priorities and preferences in relation to our current

action proposals and your own proposals about these and other  initiatives,

Â·  We are confident that, as with previous Forums,

this meeting will be a further step in the development of  understanding and cooperation between ourselves, and that the  two days of discussion will provide a framework for the progress  of this relationship in the years to come. It is in this:

confident expectation that I have great pleasure in declaring  the 1978 Australian-ASEAN Forum open. ,
