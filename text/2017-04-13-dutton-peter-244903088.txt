E&EO…………………………………………………………………………………………..

RAY HADLEY:

Minister, good morning to you.

PETER DUTTON:

Good morning, Ray.

RAY HADLEY:

Look, just first things first; I had a discussion early this week with the Deputy Premier  in New South Wales John Barilaro after I had a discussion with business leaders  about the Category C assistance for northern New South Wales. That means that  non-profit organisations and small businesses can get their hands on 15 grand for  clean-up and recovery costs. Now, that took three days to get going. The Deputy  Prime Minister and Acting Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce on TV last night talking  about the fact that the Queensland State Government is dragging the chain in  relation to Tropical Cyclone Debbie, they needed to get some forms filled in. Surely  to goodness we'd expect them to be filled in and the money to flow to the people  immediately in Queensland, as it has in northern New South Wales.

PETER DUTTON:

Well Ray, Annastacia Palaszczuk has spent every day since she's been elected  Premier employing more public servants. Now, surely this application can be put  together in a day. People need the money. They deserve the money and that's the  legal process and if you get it quickly submitted, as New South Wales did, then the  issue's resolved.

So I don't understand why Annastacia Palaszczuk wants to play games on this issue.  These people should be working round the clock to get the information required as

New South Wales has done, as Queensland has done in the past and then Barnaby  Joyce or the Minister responsible can act as quickly as possible.

RAY HADLEY:

So it's contradictory…the story in The Financial Review, which was put online last  night at about half past six, said Barnaby Joyce said he wanted me to write to him to  cut the red tape and get the money out the door. I've done that. And then she says  quote: ‘the paperwork has been finalised.’ Well, if it's been finalised last night that  means it hasn't gone to him yet.

PETER DUTTON:

Well, I mean she's just being cute with words. At the same time people are tidying up  their businesses, hosing out showrooms and all the rest of it. People need help and  they need it now and they shouldn't be held up by some game-playing by Annastacia  Palaszczuk.

RAY HADLEY:

I don't know if you've seen the vision overnight and this morning from the Prime  Minister, his last media conference, a doorstop before he left India, but it looks to me  - and the body language would suggest to me that there is a little brawl brewing with  some Cabinet Ministers over super for first-home buyers the housing package - they  say, the people who want it to happen, it would allow young families to access their  superannuation saving to help fund a home deposit. I'm getting emails from people in  the real estate industry saying Ray, that will just lift prices, that won't stop prices. But  he made it very clear when I saw the vision this morning, the Prime Minister, that he  doesn't seem to have changed his mind from his original position. So it could be a  little barney here.

PETER DUTTON:

Well I don't think the PM's changed his mind. I think the PM's got it right. He's  referred back to his previous words on this to say that it's not good policy and I agree  with him. I think the Prime Minister's made the right call. Now, people have rightly  explored options about what you could do around housing affordability, ruled out  negative gearing and the PM now has dealt with this issue as well.

So there are other ways that you can provide help, but you don't want to fuel the  prices. You don't want to create a situation that's worse than what we've got at the  moment and I was having a looking at Labor’s policy of this abolition of negative  gearing the other day. You know basically Ray, that says to anybody - I mean any  listener who's 50, 60, 70-years of age, whatever your age, if you're a homeowner  now listening to this programme, that Labor's policy is to reduce the price of your  house so that young people can come into the market - now that would be a disaster  for the economy.

Bill Shorten's resisted giving that answer five times in the last two days, but that is  their policy and we can't allow confidence to be completely and utterly zapped from

the market. If people are sitting on a house, they want a steady increase in their  price, they don't want to see the house price go down at the same time that some of  these Greens policies that Labor's presiding over would see energy prices go up. It  would be a disaster for households around the country.

RAY HADLEY:

You've got a whole range of people listening, baby boomers at the moment, who in  the late '50s, early '60s, particularly in Sydney and Brisbane where there was a  building boom, might have paid 1,500 pound or 3,000 pound for a house, a block  and land. By the 1970s that had escalated to about 25 or 30 grand in Sydney  particularly, not as expensive in Brisbane, and those people are now at retirement  age and beyond. That's their super. That's the equity. They own their home now and  say in the area where my parents were when I was a boy when we came to the city, I  think I'm right in saying through the Rural Bank they bought a home, they were in  Housing Commission and bought a home for 3,000 pound. When my Dad passed  the home sold for in the mid 20s, up to 30 grand.

That home is now worth at Dundas Valley; I suspect somewhere between 750 and a  million dollars and the people who are still in those homes that I grew up with, that's  their super. That's where they are. That's all they've got left.

PETER DUTTON:

Well Ray, people have put money into their house, they've renovated, they've added  value, they've taken care of what is a prized asset and if Labor's policy sees the four  rental properties in your suburb or your street go down in value, well you know what?  Every owner occupied house is going to go down in value as well - that is the whole  idea of the Labor Party policy.

Now they got away with this at the last election, but they won't get away with it again  because people are on to it, people realise that driving down the prices of three or  four homes in the street is going to have a flow-on impact to every other house in the  street. Who is going to buy those three or four houses, which will mean the price will  come down.

Now, as I say, if that's Labor's wish, that's their policy, they need to explain it. They  haven't. They need to because as you say people have invested a lot of money, if  they see their house price going down then confidence goes through the floor and  that is an economic disaster for this country.

RAY HADLEY:

Okay, back to your portfolio, there was a story by Kylar Loussikian in The Telegraph  I think from memory back on April three and I tried to raise it with you last week, but  you were still getting advice from the Department about these people; Jitend and  Joytika Prasad who arrived from Fiji as tourists - and we're talking about back in the  Sydney Olympic era, year 2000 - then decided shortly after they arrived here, a  month after they arrived, they wanted protection in living in Fiji - why they want it I  don't know.

They have gone to every way of appealing. They've even…I mean this is hard to  believe, but they failed at the Admin Appeals Tribunal which is usually very  sympathetic to people going to them, very sympathetic. Satisfied the applicants have  no real chance of suffering harm in Fiji. They've got three children; two who are born  here in that last 17-year period. They've racked up a sizeable debt to taxpayers to  fund law suits. We paid for every law suit. They've been on the public teat in relation  to that. Where are we up to with them today?

PETER DUTTON:

So Ray, there's been an enforcement action in relation to that particular case. Those  people have been taken into immigration detention and they are awaiting deportation  now.

As I said on the programme, people are entitled to their fair hearing, their fair day in  court, but the Australian taxpayers' aren't going to be taken for mugs and that's why  we have increased dramatically the number of deportations. We aren't going to pay  for these endless legal roundabouts. There are lots of do-gooders out there that  provide free legal support, but in the end the taxpayer funds the legal bill that I have  to pay each month as Minister and it's a real problem because people work hard,  they pay their taxes, they don't expect money to be wasted on cases where there is  no valid reason to stay and they're only stalling tactics employed.

So this still has a little way to go, but they've been taken into immigration detention  and they can expect to be deported sooner than later.

RAY HADLEY:

Is it more complicated because there are two of the three children born in Australia  or can that be dealt with?

PETER DUTTON:

No, that's not a reason as to why the parents can't be deported. All of that needs to  be taken into consideration. It has been taken into consideration and as you say,  through this separate quasi-judicial process as well with the AAT, it's had its fair  hearing, the matter has been finalised and as we always say; if people have had a  determination that they need to leave the country, they should do so as quickly as  possible.

RAY HADLEY:

And I might mention, I did target the Admin Appeals Tribunals, but prior to getting  there, they'd been to the Federal Court, the Federal Magistrates Court and the  Refugee Review Tribunal, who all arrived at the same conclusion as the Admin  Appeals Tribunal that the applicants have no chance of suffering any harm back in  Fiji. So it's denied. Okay.

Look, I've given you a little bit of notice - well not you, but your Department - on this  one and I've got to be very careful because it comes from inside Villawood Detention

5

www.minister.border.gov.au

Centre. I won't identify the church at the moment, but there's a church group, which  attends the centre on a weekly basis; Villawood and according to this detainee, who  we have spoken to strangely enough - we don't have a problem talking to the  detainee - funding solicitors and providing support for convicted paedophiles.

Now, I'd imagine there's a group of people, paedophiles awaiting deportation under  your orders or under the Department's orders and one was released as recently as  last Friday, after convicted of downloading child porn. He got a visa after this church  paid all of his legal expenses and the documentation apparently passed through the  Department.

Are you aware of this story? Does it have any legs?

PETER DUTTON:

Ray, I'm aware of it. I mean there are a few points in it. Firstly, in relation to  Villawood or any Immigration Detention Centre, it's not a jail, so people do have  access to phones, they have access to visits and many of the church groups and  other community groups decide to come in and bring gift baskets and all sorts of  things - that's their want, that's fair enough.

I am aware that this church has provided legal funding for some of these people,  including this individual that you spoke of.

RAY HADLEY:

And convicted paedophiles? Can you confirm that?

PETER DUTTON:

Well, I don't know about other cases or what they're involved in otherwise, but in  relation to this case, I'm advised that they have paid his legal bills. Now…

RAY HADLEY:

…can you confirm that this person is a paedophile?

PETER DUTTON:

Well I'll come to that in a second. So, I've given an instruction that firstly, we want to  cancel the visas of outlaw motorcycle gang members. We've done that. Over 130,  140 over the course of the last 18 months. I've also given an instruction that we want  to cancel the visas of paedophiles and people that have committed sexual offences  against children and women as a priority. Now, we've ramped the numbers up.

I've had a look at this particular case and there are extenuating circumstances in  relation to this particular matter, which involve children, the wife's medical condition  etc. It is a fairly unique case and it's not quite as has been presented to you.

6

www.minister.border.gov.au

So I've personally had a look at it and my judgement is that this is a different case to  some others. But generally …

RAY HADLEY:

…but is he a paedophile?

PETER DUTTON:

Well he's not a paedophile in the sense that, my understanding on the advice that  I've got, is that he hasn't sexually violated any child. There was an issue in relation to  taking some photos, which involved some of his family members, but again, I don't  want to go into all the details of the case, but I have looked at it in meticulous detail  and it is a peculiar case and that's been commented on in the judicial process.

RAY HADLEY:

In general, is this church generally representing paedophiles that are housed in  Villawood, awaiting deportation?

PETER DUTTON:

Ray, I don't know the answer to that question. As I say, the churches are involved in  supporting all sorts of refugees, of people in immigration detention and no doubt  including some of these people that have been charged with sexual offences.

Now, that is an issue for the church to answer. Why they would be funding that is an  issue for them and they can answer for themselves.

RAY HADLEY:

Alright, well I'm going to name the church now. I tell you why I'm naming the church;  the church is the Hillsong Church and the reason I name them is because quite a  number of years ago I had an extensive interview with the head of the church Brian  Houston. Mr Houston chose to come on this programme and explain the fact that his  father, Frank, was a convicted paedophile and that he said at the time to me and  other people, that he greatly regretted not reporting his paedophile father to police  and said other church leaders knew and did nothing about it.

I'd be very distraught if, given his background, an honourable man like Brian  Houston, was allowing his church, The Hillsong Church, to make representations on  behalf of child sex offenders via legal means, given the background of Brian and his  church. I'd be very disappointed. Very disappointed.

PETER DUTTON:

Well as I say Ray, I mean it's an issue for the church to justify their spending of  money in this space and it's not something that I understand, but it's an issue for the  church to justify and explain.

RAY HADLEY:

Well, I'll be putting those questions to Brian Houston today.

PETER DUTTON:

Well I think that's fair enough.

RAY HADLEY:

And saying to him - and again he came on this programme of his own volition and  was sickened by his father's behaviour and sickened by other senior church leaders  doing nothing about the predator, Frank, his father, Frank Houston, molesting  children back in the 1970s. At the time he told a congregation - and this is going  back a couple of years - of more than 3000; the victim - whom his late father tried to  buy forgiveness from for $10,000 - did not want the allegations investigated by  police or the church, but he greatly regretted the fact that he just simply didn't report  it to the church as he should of at the time - and things have changed in light of the  child Royal Commission, the child sexual abuse Royal Commission.

Just on this; one final thing given you and I have spoken about this quite in detail. I'm  really, really delighted that Justice Peter McClellan - and I've mentioned this before  - a Supreme Court Justice of some note comes to be the Royal Commissioner and  my words not his, paraphrasing him, says; ‘God, until I did this, I had no idea the  suffering of the victims.’ And this is a man that had dealt with these type of victims  previously, as Justice of the Supreme Court.

Today, he's talking to other legal minds about the fact that we sentence paedophiles  in 2017, if their crimes were committed 30 or 40 years ago, on the expectations of  the sentencing back then and he's saying; I don't think that's right, I think we need to  have a review of this. If someone is convicted in 2017, they need to face a long time  in jail, not the sentence that was appropriate way back in the 1970s or 80s.

PETER DUTTON:

Of course they should Ray. I mean there's no question about that.

Along time ago as a police officer, I worked as a detective in the sexual assault  investigation unit. I've interviewed countless people in relation to offences, taken  witness statements from children, from women and it is an abhorrent crime. For me,  it's always been a great frustration some of these sentences that are handed down  and it shows, in some cases, that they've not taken into proper consideration the life  that the victim has then lead, the pain that they've gone through, the suffering, the  psychological trauma, all the rest of it. It makes you more protective of your own  children, it makes you more passionate in these areas to do whatever you can, but in  the end, community expectation is that these matters are dealt with by the courts and  dealt with in a harsh way. People need to recognise that and I think he should be  commended for his comments, which I saw today, and that is the only deterrent that  we can put in place.

RAY HADLEY:

Okay, I'm having a week off. We'll catch you in a fortnight from now. I am going to  the Gold Coast if you are about during the school holidays and maybe we can catch  up.

PETER DUTTON:

Round of golf maybe…

RAY HADLEY:

Do something like that together, if you're away for a week, but I'll be replaced by  Mark Levy in fact, next week. Mark's coming in to do my programme for Tuesday,  Wednesday, Thursday, Friday. I'll be here tomorrow and Easter Monday and back  the following Monday, as well. And I'll give you a yell and we'll maybe catch up.

PETER DUTTON:

Look forward to it, mate. Thank you.

RAY HADLEY:

All the best to you. That's Peter Dutton, the Immigration Minister. Based, of course,  in Queensland.
