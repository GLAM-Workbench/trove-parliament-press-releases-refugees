TRANSCRIPT OF DR HEWSON

LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION

DOORSTOP - 22 MAY 1990

Jrnlst:

... (inaudible) ...

Hewson:

I am quite surprised, as I have been saying I think they  have had seven different policies since the beginning of  this year and in that sense I am pleased that they have  finally made up their mind. But what I can't understand is  why they have changed what has been a policy in place in

legislation for nearly ten years. And the policy was to  limit foreign ownership of licences to 20% and by way of  holding companies I think the limit was 49.9% and that was  a clear intention of the law, it is the basis on which  everyone in the industry has been operating now for the best  part of ten years, if they want to change that they need to  explain why and to whose benefit they changed it.

Jrnlst:

What do you think of the ... (inaudible) ....?

Hewson:

I sun not sure what you mean by that, sorry.

Jrnlst:

Well, the fact that there are different rules for Channel  10, for example.

Hewson:

Well, the industry has operated, as I said, under a policy  that has been there for ten years, or the best part of ten  years. Now if they are saying that there is loop hole in  that policy in the law as it has been drafted, then surely

they should just amend the law and stay with the explicit  intention of the law rather than to change policy, which is  what they have done.

Jrnlst:

But, Dr Hewson do you concede that it will protect  Australian culture?

Hewson:

I am not sure that it has got much to do with Australian  culture, the limits are on ownership, what is done by way of  Australian content and so on in our television is of course  subject to the broadcasting tribunal.

Jrnlst:

Do you suspect they are playing their mates off against each  other?

Hewson:

I have no idea. I find it rather odd that they have changed  what has been a long standing position that has been  accepted by the industry, and operated on by the industry,  all this time. As I say, if you are changing a position

like that, if you are fundamentally changing policy - which  they are - then they need to explain to everyones  satisfaction why and to whose benefit. And as you say, it  has differential effects in the industry which has been  operating on the assumption that the present law will  continue to operate?

Jrnlst:

Do you agree to the 20% limit?

Hewson:

Well, the 20% limit on licences, yes we have agreed to that,  and we thought the intention of the law as it stood was that  maximum foreign holding through holding companies would be  limited to 49.9, and as I say, if in fact there is a loop

hole to that nobody has yet demonstrated that that is the  case - and I don't think anybody has breached it either -  but if there is an argument that there is a loop hole why  not simply amend the existing law to preserve the existing

positions rather than change policy, which is what they are  doing.

Jrnlst:

Do you think that Alan Bond should be angry tonight after  all, this decision looks like it is playing into the hands  of Kerry Packer?

Hewson:

It is not for me to determine who is winning, and who is  losing out of this decision, I simply make a fairly strong  point that there was a clear cut position as we understood  the law, and that has always been the position that we have

supported, and ÃÂª can't understand why all of a sudden that  Mr Beazley and the Cabinet have decided to change. In  changing they obviously benefit some at the expense of  others and they need to explain why.

Jrnlst:

Do you believe that some networks will be further  financially disadvantaged by the decision?

Hewson:

Well, it is difficult for me to comment on the particular  situation of networks, individual networks. What I would  say is that obviously the industry is in difficult  circumstances and obviously they need to make some major  restructuring decisions and that is never helped by a  Government that can't make up its mind and as I said, had

seven policies since the beginning of the year and has now  finally decided to change policy.

Thank you.
