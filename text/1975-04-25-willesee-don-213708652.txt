The ANZUS Council held its Twenty-Fourth Meeting in  Washington on April 24 and 25, 1975. The Senator the Honourable  Donald R. Willesee,  Minister for Foreign Affairs,  represented  Australia: the Honorable Arthur J. Faulkner, Minister of Labor, represented New Zealand: and the Honorable Robert S. Ingersoll, Deputy Secretary of State,  represented the U.S. Secretary of State.  Henry A. Kissinger also participated in the Meeting.

The Ministers exchanged views on a wide range of  strategic,  political and economic issues of concern to the ANZUS  partners. They reaffirmed the enduring nature of the relationÂ­ ship among the three countries,  based as it is on a substantial  community of interests and a shared heritage of representative  a  democracy, individual freedom, and the rule of law. The ANZUS  W  Â·  Treaty and the regular consultations for which it provides are a

natural expression of this close relationship.

The Ministers welcomed the continuing process of detente  among the major powers, and efforts to work toward a more stable  and co-operative relationship among states.  They expressed hope  that renewed efforts might bring about peace in areas of continuÂ­ ing conflict such as Indochina, and more peaceful and stable  relationships in areas of recent or potential conflict such as the  near East.

The Ministers reviewed the situation in Indochina. The  Ministers noted the plight of refugees in South Vietnam and  regretted the continuing loss of life and the widespread human  misery caused by the fighting. They recognized that an early end

to the fighting, an adherence to the Paris Agreements, and a spirit  of nationalÂ«reconciliation were prereauisites to an end to the  suffering. The Council expressed the hope that the wounds of war  in Cambodia would be speedily healed,  and noted with satisfaction  the continued peaceful evolution in Laos.

The Council welcomed the emergence of a new spirit of

regional consciousness and self reliance in South East Asia and  the practical measures being taken to develop the habit of regional  co-operation. The Ministers applauded the progress made by the  Association of South East Asian Nations and indicated the desire

of their countries to assist this co-operation.

The Ministers agreed that the South East Asian Treaty  Organization and the Five Power Defence Arrangements con.trii.hnted  to the climate of confidence in the area and provided a useful  framework for practical co-operation.

The Council reviewed the world economic situation with  special attention to its effects within the Asia/Pacific region.' They discussed the difficulties caused by the present downturn in  the world economic situation and also the collective international

effort which haskdaegun to evoke a more soundly based world economic  order. The Ministers agreed on the importance of close co-operation  among themselves and with other nations on problems of international  finance and trade.  In particular, they agreed that in matters '   relating to trade in raw materials and primary products the interests

of both producers and consumers should be taken into account. The  Ministers expressed the hope that oil exporting and oil importing  countries would seek to reconcile differences between them through  dialogue. They affirmed the need for continued efforts aimed at

liberalisation of international trade.  The Ministers noted the  special economic problems faced by the less developed countries of  Asia"and the Pacific and agreed on the need for efforts to see that  the net flow of resources to those countries is not diminished.

The Council reviewed progress toward arms limitations and  the limiting of the proliferation of nuclear weapons. The Ministers  agreed that further measures of arms control are a necessary  concomitant of the continuing trend toward detente and the establishÂ­ ment of a just and stable world order. Noting the need for progress

towards reduction in nuclear weapons,  the Council expressed the hope  that the strategic arms limitiation talks between the United States  and the U.S.S.R. will make further progress.  The Council supported  the continuing negotiations to achieve mutual and balanced force  reductions in Europe as an important stage in the effort to bring  about the limitation of conventional arms.  The Ministers noted that  a conference of the parties will review the operation of the NonÂ­ Proliferation Treaty, and expressed their hope for a strengthening Ã¢ÂÂ

of the non-proliferation regime.  The Council noted the conclusion  of a threshold Test Ban Treaty and reaffirmed its support for the  early achievement of an effective comprehensive Test Ban.Treaty.

The Ministers welcomed the continued development of a  community of independent and self-governing states in the South  Pacific, including the forthcoming independence of Papua New Guinea.  They noted with satisfaction the constructive role Australia has

played, in assisting the emergence of this new state.  .
