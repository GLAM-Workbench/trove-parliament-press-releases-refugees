2018 AUSTRALASIAN AID CONFERENCE

AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL UNIVERSITY, CANBERRA

*** CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY ***

May I begin by acknowledging that we are attending the 2018 Australasian Aid Conference on  the lands of the Ngunnawal and Ngambri peoples and by paying our respects to their Elders  past and present.

It is a pleasure to speak to you all this morning. The Australian National University and the Asia  Foundation are to be congratulated for their continuing research into and contribution to  international development assistance policy. You have assembled a very distinguished panel of  *ÃÂª*ÃÂ¢*****l***ÃÂ¥*ÃÂª**Â¡*Z*}**Â¡*]*o*o*U*/*[*u**ÃÂª*Âµ*ÃÂ¥***U**ÃÂª*Z*]*v*******(*}*ÃÂ¥***v*ÃÂª*]****o*]*P*Z*ÃÂ¶**}*v***Âµ*ÃÂª*ÃÂ¶*ÃÂ¥***o*]***[*ÃÂª****Âµ*ÃÂ¥*ÃÂ¥***v*ÃÂ¶**ÃÂ¢***ÃÂ¥*(*}*ÃÂ¥*u***v***** in  delivering international development assistance.

And I trust that your deliberations will also provide a set of constructive suggestions on how our  performance can be improved.

As Shadow Foreign Minister, I have been laying out the framework for a Labor Foreign Policy of  purpose, energy and conviction that protects and advances our national interests and projects  our identity and standing in the world.

And a central element of such a foreign policy is development assistance.

Put simply, international development assistance is central to the way in which Labor will  realise its foreign policy.

And how do we do this? By building social and human capital.

For a democratic, caring and generous nation like Australia, international development  assistance has long been a central element in our foreign policy, consistent with our values and  our national interests. We have a deep interest in and commitment to the maintenance of  stability in our region, and to reducing poverty.

And if the generosity that is a natural consequence of our respect for our shared humanity is  not sufficient motivation, we should recognise the economic and security consequences of  instability and poverty. These consequences are not only borne by the individual communities  and nations affected, but in an increasingly interconnected world they impact on all of us.

Failure to recognise this is profoundly short sighted. Moreover, the decision by the Abbott and  Turnbull governments to walk away from international development assistance funding  undermines our national interests.

Australia gives just 22 cents per $100 of our national income to  development assistance. This is the lowest level since records were kept.

Labor has previously called on the Coalition to join us in a bipartisan commitment to rebuilding  **Âµ*ÃÂª*ÃÂ¶*ÃÂ¥***o*]***[*ÃÂª****]******v********Â¿***o*}*ÃÂ¢*u***v*ÃÂ¶**ÃÂ¢*ÃÂ¥*}*P*ÃÂ¥***u*ÃÂª*X*

We have sought this because we know the human costs of the Abbott-d*Âµ*ÃÂ¥*v***Âµ*o*o*'*}*Â¿***ÃÂ¥*v*u***v*ÃÂ¶*[*ÃÂª* $11.3 billion in cuts.

These cuts affect the lives of people who can least afford it.

We all understand that reduced international development assistance funding leads to less  development, poorer health outcomes, more poverty and greater deprivation. In particular, we  know that cuts to international development assistance translate into:

Ã¯ÂÂ· M ore maternal deaths;  Ã¯ÂÂ· Fewer vaccinated children;   Ã¯ÂÂ· Fewer girls in school ; and

Ã¯ÂÂ· A greater number of vulnerable communities experiencing disproportionate impacts of  climate change.

And so with this in mind, I can say with confidence that a Shorten Labor Government will  contribute more to international development assistance than the current Government. And  we will ensure more of it gets to the people who it is meant to be assisting.

We will, to the fullest extent that financial circumstances allow, rebuild and grow the Australian  aid program in a timely manner.  Our intention is once again to reflect the generosity of the  Australian community.

So I again encourage the Turnbull Government to return to a properly bipartisan approach to  international development assistance. Their current budgeted levels, which will see a relative  decline, are not defensible.

Poverty is the red column of the economic inequality ledger. A stream of studies continues to  demonstrate that, at the national level, economic inequality has grown across the globe.

As you all would know, in its 2016 study An Economy for the 1%, Oxfam showed that the richest  one per cent now own more than the rest of the world combined. In 2015, sixty-two individuals  had the same wealth as 3.6 billion people. In the previous decade and a half, the bottom half of  humanity gained just one percent of the total increase in global wealth, while fifty percent went  to the top one percent.

International development assistance will continue to be critical if structural inequality is to be  addressed effectively. Of course, development assistance alone does not fix the problem: it  needs to be accommodated within the broader framework of economic management that  takes in matters like trade liberalisation, sound lending and investment practices, transparency  and international cooperation to address multinational tax avoidance.

At the ACFID conference in November last year, I outlined how global inequality and the  poverty it generates cannot be addressed simply as a function of economic growth. In the  current climate, it is even more apparent that for growth to have wide benefits, it must take  into account distribution.

So global development assistance funding is needed more than ever. And the critical outcome  of development assistance must continue to be poverty reduction and its elimination. But the  evidence suggests that the eradication of poverty *t  or even its reduction *t  is on a concerning  trajectory, moving ever further from our grasp.

d*Z****Eh*[*ÃÂª*****Â¿***o*}*ÃÂ¢*u***v*ÃÂ¶*W*}*o*]***Â«*****v*ÃÂ¶*ÃÂ¥****ÃÂ¢*ÃÂ¥*}***Âµ*****ÃÂª****Ã¢ÂÂ*****o*o***v*ÃÂ¶**Â¡*}*ÃÂ¥*l**}*v******Â¿***o*}*ÃÂ¢*u***v*ÃÂ¶****ÃÂª*ÃÂª*]*ÃÂª*ÃÂ¶***v*****X*/*ÃÂ¶*ÃÂª* surveys suggest that, while the Australian community is uncertain about the levels of  development assistance funding and the results achieved, it continues to support public  development assistance funding.

Given the growing demands on international development assistance funding, public support is  a critical issue.

In our nearby region, demand for assistance far outstrips the capacity of development  assistance donors, both government and NGO, to deliver.

The flow of Rohingya refugees to Bangladesh imposes enormous demands on a country that is  struggling to meet its own development goals. Refugee flows resulting from ongoing armed  conflict in Syria and Yemen continue to strain international agencies and aid donors. Many  parts of Africa are in crisis as a result of civil war, consequent displacement of populations, and  drought. The 65 million people who are currently displaced globally surpass the number of  people displaced during WW2.

As I have said, meeting demand has been made enormously more difficult as a result of the  ******}*ÃÂ¶*ÃÂ¶****v***d*Âµ*ÃÂ¥*v***Âµ*o*o**P*}*Â¿***ÃÂ¥*v*u***v*ÃÂ¶*ÃÂª*[******* p funding cuts. But even when we do return to historical  levels of international development assistance funding, the need is greater than our ability to  meet the demand. It is for this reason, among others, that we see the emergence of new  development assistance donors and new approaches to financing.

Of course, it is important that new donors and new approaches are sensitive to the on-the- ground needs of the recipients, and that projects are carefully calibrated to the ability of the  recipients both to absorb and maintain the assistance provided. This is particularly important if  *ÃÂ¶*Z******ÃÂª*ÃÂª*]*ÃÂª*ÃÂ¶***v******]*ÃÂª**ÃÂ¢*ÃÂ¥*}*Â¿*]********]*v**ÃÂ¶*Z****(*}*ÃÂ¥*u**}*(**ÃÂª*}*(*ÃÂ¶**o*}***v*ÃÂª*X*^*Âµ***Z**o*}***v*ÃÂª**u*Âµ*ÃÂª*ÃÂ¶**ÃÂ¥***(*o*****ÃÂ¶**ÃÂ¶*Z****ÃÂ¥*****]*ÃÂ¢*]***v*ÃÂ¶*ÃÂª*[*  ability to service them.

The need of our neighbours for assistance and advice on the provision of all forms of  development assistance did not wane or disappear when the Australian government  abandoned the development assistance priorities laid down by successive Australian  governments since the 1970s.

If anything, the nature and pace of economic and social developments in our region accelerated  just at the time that the Abbott and Turnbull governments pulled back. So it is unsurprising that  our neighbours seek assistance from other countries and institutions.

Countries will seek support and assistance for their development priorities wherever they can,  and donors will respond to such requests as they see fit.

There is a far greater unmet demand and scope for all forms of development assistance than  can ever be met by any single country or institution, no matter how large.

What has become clear, however, is the need for greater efforts to coordinate the design and  delivery of development assistance programs across the region, both to protect against  duplication and to ensure that the programs delivered, and their associated financing packages,  meet the needs of the recipients. It is important that through-life costs are factored into the  total development investment cost.

Greater dovetailing of development assistance activities will certainly generate greater  efficiencies at a time when funding levels are under extreme pressure.

First of all, Labor accepts that the UN-mandated Sustainable Development Goals provide a  practical guide to development assistance outcomes. They offer a framework for implementing  the Grand Bargain struck by major aid organisations and donors at their meeting in Istanbul in  2016. The Grand Bargain recognised that the status quo is no longer an option. We need to find  and create efficiency, which in turn demands innovation, collaboration and changed mindsets.  And central to changed mindsets, is the focus on social and human capital.

As social and human capital increase, poverty reduces.

This acknowledges that both developed and developing countries have something to offer and  something to learn from each other when it comes to ensuring equality and prosperity. This is  the essence of social and human capital development. It is mutual, and it is dynamic.

Second, we will work to ensure that development and delivery mechanisms are streamlined.

Third, we need to recognise that the various outcomes identified by the SDGs are interlinked,  and that what happens in one target area may affect other target areas in quite profound ways.

To illustrate our approach, I want to look briefly at four particular streams of development  assistance *t  climate change, health, gender and education.

During the November 2017 COP in Bonn, Fiji and the World Bank released their Climate  Vulnerability Assessment which highlighted the fact that climate change presents poverty  reduction with even more formidable odds.

Fiji is not the only country in this position. The February 2017 OECD/World Bank report Climate  and Disaster Resilience Financing found

Ã¯ÂÂ· V anuatu, which receives $69.8 million in ODA from Australia, loses over $50 million, or  6.6 per cent of annual GDP, due to natural disasters.   Ã¯ÂÂ· To nga suffers a 4.4 per cent loss of annual GDP, amounting to over $17 million.  Ã¯ÂÂ· B oth Fiji and the Solomon Islands incur losses above 2.6 percent and 2.99 percent of

GDP respectively as a result of natural disasters, amounting to over $150 million each  year.

If our development assistance program is seeking to grow the social and human capital that lifts  people out of poverty while the consequences of climate change continue to undermine that  outcome, then disaster risk reduction must become a more prominent feature of our  development assistance planning.

Climate change impacts every aspect of the Australian Aid Program such that we cannot be  serious about tackling poverty in our region if we are not serious about tackling climate change.

In a sobering 2014 report, the World Health Organisation forecast that, worldwide, climate  change will cause an additional 250,000 deaths per annum between 2030 and 2050: 38

thousand from heat exposure, 60 thousand from Malaria, 48 thousand from diarrhoea and 95  thousand from malnutrition.

The regional effects of climate change have been ignored by the Coalition. Yet they constitute  an existential threat to a number of island and archipelagic states, and we need to invest in  building the national resilience *t  their capacity to deal with both mitigation and adaptation.

What affects the Pacific affects us.

Leaving aside the unfortunate emphasis on celebrity and an apparent fascination with  beanbags, I question whether it adds a sufficiently ambitious degree of innovation to Australi***[*ÃÂª* aid program.

There seems to be a view that innovation comprises a series of lightbulb moments, rather than  recognising the merit of creative and dynamic partnerships that bring a wide range of  perspectives to problem solving. Certainly the feedback from many outstanding research  bodies here in Australia would suggest there is much more to offer from collaboration than we  are attaining.

The innovationXchange also operates in what appears to be relative isolation, not only in its  location, but in its impact on the Australian aid program.

In Government, Labor will take a much more considered approach in how innovation is  integrated across our aid program.

Health, along with education, is a fundamental contributor to the growth of social and human  capital. Chronic but preventable ill-health is a show-stopper with respect to economic  participation, and without economic participation individuals and communities are consigned  to misery.

Investment in quality health systems not only improves individual wellbeing, but also has a  positive impact on the community in the longer term *t  contributing to both prosperity and  stability.

For example, one of the biggest challenges facing our region is child stunting due to poor and  unhygienic nutrition.

60 per cent of children in Timor Leste, 44 per cent of children in PNG, 33 per cent of children in  Kiribati and 26 per cent of children in Vanuatu are stunted.

Despite many countries and regions improving nutrition levels as they met the Millennium  Development Goals, we have seen no substantial improvement in the Pacific since the 1990s.

The Pacific and Timor Leste have incredibly young populations. Without health interventions at  an early age, the potential quality of life for individuals and the future economic development  of the region will be severely diminished before many of these children have even started  school.

Addressing the health needs of children in the region has strong return on investment and,  *]*u*ÃÂ¢*}*ÃÂ¥*ÃÂ¶***v*ÃÂ¶*o*Â«*U**]*v*ÃÂ¶***ÃÂ¥*Â¿***v*ÃÂ¶*]*}*v**]*v****Z*]*o***ÃÂ¥***v*[*ÃÂª**Z*****o*ÃÂ¶*Z**ÃÂ¥*****Âµ*****ÃÂª**(*Âµ*ÃÂ¶*Âµ*ÃÂ¥******}*ÃÂª*ÃÂ¶**}*v  ****ÃÂ¥*****]*ÃÂ¢*]***v*ÃÂ¶****}*Âµ*v*ÃÂ¶*ÃÂ¥*Â«*[*ÃÂª* health infrastructure.

Within the Aid budget, we need to sharpen our focus on child health, particularly in the Pacific,  where immunisation coverage remains lower than other areas of the Indo-Pacific. The low  availability and use of the Hib vaccine is of real concern.

When I spoke at ACFID, I said that Labor would seek to build on the work that the current  Government has done in bringing gender to the forefront of our aid program.

Our focus on the empowerment of women must address the structural factors that allow the  discrimination that causes gender inequality.  If we do not address these structural barriers, we  risk finding ourselves in the scenario we had in PNG during the election, where, despite having  ****ÃÂ¥*****}*ÃÂ¥****v*Âµ*u*****ÃÂ¥**}*(**(***u***o********v***]*****ÃÂ¶***ÃÂª*U**u***v*Â«**}*(**Â¡*Z*}*u**Â¡***ÃÂ¥****ÃÂª*Âµ*ÃÂ¢*ÃÂ¢*}*ÃÂ¥*ÃÂ¶********Â«***Âµ*ÃÂª*ÃÂ¶*ÃÂ¥***o*]***[*ÃÂª****]*** program, no women were elected.

The maternal death rate in the Pacific and Timor Leste remains unacceptably high.

We know maternal death rates can be reduced through properly funded sexual health and  family planning programs.

This area of programing has experienced turbulent changes as a result of the Global Gag rule *t   which Marie Stopes International claims has resulted in the deaths of nearly 7,000 women and  girls due to avoidable maternal health complications.

Cervical cancer rates in the Pacific are among the highest in the world.  Women in the Pacific  Islands are dying at a rate up to nine times that of Australian women due to the fact that  screening is not routinely available.  In the Pacific, the incidence of cervical cancer rests  between 13.3 (Timor) and 37.8 (Fiji) per 100 thousand. Sadly for these women, the diagnosis of  cervical cancer often comes too late, with cervical cancer mortality rates the highest in PNG at  21.7 per 100 thousand women.

Besides health, education is the second pillar on which social and human capital are built. At  present, Australia dedicates $675.3 million of its ODA funding to education.

In an  Overseas Development Assistance budget totalling $5.2 billion, education attracted over almost  $1.1billion.

In a report published in May last year, UNESCO demonstrated that, globally, development  assistance in education plateaued in 2010, and has been stagnating ever since. This is due, in  part, to the reallocation of development assistance funds to refugee assistance, permissible  under the aid rules, and in part to the decline in aid funding in the aftermath of the GFC.

The Coalition has continued with its precipitous decline in education funding by reducing its  already low contribution to the Global Partnership for Education by a further $50 million.

But if developing countries are to develop the social and human capital necessary to lift  themselves out of poverty, education must be a principal target.

They have both impugned our  reputation internationally, and have undermined our national interests.

They have harmed our efforts to alleviate poverty, and make our region safer and more secure.  They have diminished our standing in the region.

They are also, I firmly believe, at odds with the generous spirit of the Australian people.

That is why Labor considers we must, and can, do better.
