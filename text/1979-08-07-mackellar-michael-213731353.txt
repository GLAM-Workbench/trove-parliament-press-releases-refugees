DEMONSTRATION IN BRISBANE - MR MACKELLAR  APPEALS FOR RESTRAINT

The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs,

the Hon. M.J.R. MacKellar, M.P., today appeals for a

calm reaction to the presence in Australia of two

communist officials from Vietnam.

Mr MacKellar said that the attitude of the

Vietnamese in Brisbane was understandable. They had been

forced to flee repression and persecution.

"However, Vietnamese residents here should not

fall into the trap of becoming involved in incidents

because of provocative statements by the two officials,"

Mr MacKellar said.

Mr MacKellar said that almost 20,000 Vietnamese

refugees who had settled in Australia had a commendable

record of hard work, diligence and integration into

Australian society. No-one can fail to be impressed by

the way in which they have committed themselves to

making a new life in Australia.
