Australia and Jordan Cooperate on People Smuggling MPS 002/2000

The Australian Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock, concluded his visit to Jordan today announcing a range of cooperative measures to address the global problem of illegal movements of people.

During his two-day stay, Mr Ruddock had a series of meetings with senior members of the Jordanian government, including the Minister of the Interior, H.E. Mr Nayef Qadi and the Minister of Foreign Affairs, H.E. Mr Abel-Elah Khatib.

Jordan was the first country being visited by Mr Ruddock on a five nation tour to discuss a cooperative approach between countries to deal with people smuggling.

Mr Ruddock said the aim of his visit was to learn more about Jordan's experiences in dealing with large-scale movements of displaced people and refugees, as well as to exchange information on people smuggling activities in the region. He noted that Jordan had suffered considerable economic and social consequences from large-scale movements of people into its territory.

Mr Ruddock also provided information on Australia's tough new measures to curb the flow of people arriving illegally in Australia. He said Australia had taken a hard line to stop people smugglers, but it also realised that a global approach was needed to stop the growing people smuggling industry, which affected many countries.

Mr Ruddock said that Jordanian officials understood that in order for Australia to better assist international efforts to resettle those in greatest need of protection, the people smuggling industry and illegal movements of people generally must be stopped. To this end we have agreed the following measures:

"Strengthening the exchange of information on, and operations against people smugglers; Ã¢ÂÂÃ¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»

"Enhanced technical cooperation, including provision of additional training and equipment for fraud detection and tracking of suspected illegal travellers to Australia."

Ã¢ÂÂÃ¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»

Australia has also offered to provide an Airport Liaison Officer in Amman in the lead up to the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games.

"I am very encouraged by the continuing positive commitment of Jordan to work closely with us on these important issues. I am also confident that in partnership with Jordan and agencies such as the UNHCR, we can develop comprehensive and innovative solutions to strengthen the international protection framework to prevent people smuggling," Mr Ruddock said.

Mr Ruddock presented a range of information material outlining Australia's new laws to Jordanian Government officials.

The material includes information about new laws recently implemented by Australia to deter people trying to enter Australia illegally.

"Under the new laws, people found to be genuine refugees are restricted from applying for permanent residency for three years and their families cannot join them for at least three, and maybe up to five years," Mr Ruddock said.

'The legislation also includes fines of up to $220,000 and 20 years' jail for people smugglers. The message is clear. Australia welcomes legal immigrants, not people trying to enter illegally."
