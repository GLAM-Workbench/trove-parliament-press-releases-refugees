AUSTRALIAN HELP FOR IRIAN JAYANS

Australia will provide temporary residence for a group of  Irian Jayans in gaol in Vanuatu, and their families.

This follows recent discussions in Melbourne between the  Prime Minister of Vanuatu, Father Walter Lini, and Prime  Minister Bob Hawke.

The Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic  Affairs, Senator Robert Ray, said the group members and  their families - 18 people in all - would be given temporary  entry permits.

The Minister said Australia would continue its efforts to  resettle the Irian Jayans in a country outside the region.

He said the' United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees  was helping with the permanent resettlement of the Irian  Jayans.

The temporary entry permits for the group and their families  would be valid for six months.

The group members would-be allowed to work in Australia.

Members of the group are expected to arrive in Sydney today.

Their families will follow later.
