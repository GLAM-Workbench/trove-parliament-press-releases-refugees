GOVERNMENT FAILS TO CUT IMMIGRATION

The Government's announced "cuts" in the immigration program are  phoney. Although the Government claims to have reduced the  program by 31,000 places, it ignores the fact that it has found  34,000 extra places for Chinese students and their dependants.

Thirty thousand in, thirty thousand out means no significant  change in immigration.

The immigration level now contemplated by the Government is going  to make it harder for Australians already out of work to find a  job. It will result in many of the new migrants ending up on

unemployment and social security, as they have over recent years.

This situation is not good for Australia, and it is not good for  the migrants coming here.

Today's announcement also says nothing about the shambles that  has overtaken the administration of the immigration program under  this Labor Government.

None of the phoney actions announced today will conceal the fact  that only the Coalition Parties can implement substantial and  real cuts in the immigration program.

The fact is that the Government's decisions today will not  achieve the necessary reductions in the migrant intake which the  worst recession in sixty years demands.

The Coalition Parties have set the pace on the migration debate  for over two years. Today's announcement from the Government  is an attempt at political catch-up. It won't work.

Only one side of politics - namely, the Opposition - will deliver  the necessary reductions over the short-term in the level of  Australia's migrant intake and generate the economic conditions  that will sustain growth in the intake over the longer term.

Even if one accepts the Government's figures at face value, the  intake of 80,000 for 1992-93 is still too high. It will only  add to unemployment in the short term, rather than do anything  to reduce it.

But the fact is that this supposed "cut" in the migrant intake  is no real cut at all. The reductions, which the Government  highlights today, are more than offset by its blanket decision  to give de facto permanent residence to 20,000 Chinese students  and more than 14,000 of their dependants.

Mr Keating chose recently to affirm that decision. He did not  do so publicly to the Australian people - but through a Chinese  community newspaper. Today's announcement from the Government  is just one aspect of living with the consequences of that flawed  decision.

The Government has failed to act in a number of important areas  where the Opposition has been pressing for months for action.  These areas include the need for stricter bona fides testing and  restrictions on social security payments to new migrants.

Furthermore, the Government's administration of the migration  program has been a shambles. Its commitment to fixed,

unrealistic targets of migrant intakes has eroded the integrity  of the whole program.

The Government has failed to take adequate account of the extent  to which the seriousness of the current recession has reduced  Australia's short-term capacity to absorb large numbers of new  migrants and the real extent to which it has discouraged

potential migrants from coming here.

The Opposition is committed to a whole new approach to the

immigration issue, and to the debate over the level of the

migrant intake, in particular:

.  We are committed to substantially lower levels of migration  over the short-term - and lower than those announced by the  Government today.  We will achieve such reductions on the  basis of non-discriminatory principles.

.  Our reductions will affect all categories of migrant entry,  with the exception of the refugee and humanitarian

category.

.  We will give an enhanced emphasis to skills and English

language proficiency in migrant selection.

.  We will toughen bona fides testing and not extend future

migrants access to benefits for two years after they first  arrive (unless they are given refugee or humanitarian entry  status).

.  We will ensure case-by-case assessment of all applications  for refugee or humanitarian entry.

.  We will give a new priority to Citizenship, and to the

rights and responsibilities that go with it.

Our more significant reductions in the intake over the shortÂ­ term, together with the other important elements of our

FiqhtbackI program, are designed to generate economic conditions  over the longer term that will sustain an increased migrant  intake.
