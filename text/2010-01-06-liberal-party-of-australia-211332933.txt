TRANSCRIPT OF THE HON. TONY ABBOTT MHR INTERVIEW WITH CHRIS  UHLMANN,7:30 REPORT, ABC TV

The Hon Tony Abbott MP

Leader of the Opposition

CHRIS UHLMANN:

Tony Abbott if the Coalition can’t run itself, why should people trust it to run the country?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well we can run ourselves and I think that’s been pretty evident over the last four weeks.

CHRIS UHLMANN:

The evidence of the last two years is though that it can’t. You’re the third leader in two years and you only got up

with half the party vote.

TONY ABBOTT:

Yes, but as Senator Kennedy famously said a one vote win is a landslide in politics. I think everything has

changed since the 1st of December.

CHRIS UHLMANN:

Have you wasted the last two years? The Coalition that is.

TONY ABBOTT:

I think we have gone through a necessary period of introspection. I now think that we have got our act together. I

think we are holding the government to account and I think we are developing credible policies and that’s why I

think it is realistic to think that we can win the next election.

CHRIS UHLMANN:

Well the country is running fairly well, its going fairly well after the greatest financial crisis to hit the world since

the Great Depression and the government seems to be going fairly well as well. So where do you beat Kevin

Rudd? How can you beat Kevin Rudd.

TONY ABBOTT:

Yeah but I think people also understand that Kevin Rudd is all talk and no action.

CHRIS UHLMANN:

Do they?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think people understand that, sure, he hasn't mucked all that much up economically but that is because he had

a tremendous legacy to work with. He has managed to turn a $20 billion surplus into a $30 billion deficit in just 12

months. He has managed to turn a Government that was massively in surplus into a Government that is

massively in deficit. So he has done a lot wrong. But I take your point - compared to other countries we have

cruised through the global financial crisis.

CHRIS UHLMANN:

Surely the government can take some credit for that. You say they've spent all this money but of course they did

that to prop up the economy and it worked.

TONY ABBOTT:

Yes but there is always a bill to be paid. And in pretending that there is no cost to this I think the people

understand that Kevin Rudd is basically conning them.

CHRIS UHLMANN:

But you would have spent money as well. The Coalition backed the first stimulus package didn’t it?

TONY ABBOTT:

Yes, which was about a quarter of the size of the second stimulus package. Which we opposed.

CHRIS UHLMANN:

But certainly that money was necessary and appears to have done the trick.

TONY ABBOTT:

But at a high price and if you look across the Tasman, New Zealand has done just as well it seems as Australia

without going into anything like the same level of debt and deficit hat we have.

CHRIS UHLMANN:

You say the government has done nothing but they've completely remade the industrial relations system, to

nationalise the system of awards is something that your government didn't even attempt.

TONY ABBOTT:

And as even Heather Ridout said in today's paper they need to be extremely careful they don't destroy the

flexibility which both the Keating and the Howard Government put in to our workplace system and which has

been responsible for us getting through the global financial crisis without the massive increase in unemployment

which other countries have suffered.

CHRIS UHLMANN:

The economy needed flexibility because the people wanted fairness and that is something that you took from

them with work choices.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well that is not true. Sure Work Choices was a mistake. It's dead. It's buried. But the no disadvantage test was at

the death restored by the former government and there's no going back by this Coalition to the excesses of the

former policy.

CHRIS UHLMANN:

Is Work Choices dead and buried? You said at your first press conference that the phrase Work Choices was

dead. Is the idea dead as well?

TONY ABBOTT:

Of course it is Chris, W\what we do need, though, is freedom as well as fairness in our workplaces. What we

need is freedom from union bullying and that's certainly the Coalition's policy will be designed to ensure.

CHRIS UHLMANN:

Do you still think the science on climate change is crap?

TONY ABBOTT:

That’s not quite what I said. Certainly the science is not nearly as settled as the wild zealots say. But, look, we

will be releasing a strong and effective climate change policy in just a few weeks. ill ask you to restrain your

impatience and wait and see what we up with.

CHRIS UHLMANN:

But do you believe that man made global warming is a factor? Is it actually a fact?

TONY ABBOTT:

In the end this is not a question of belief, it is a question of fact. I keep saying that we need more facts and less

faith in this whole argument. We should take prudent precautions against credible threats. What we shouldn't do

is impose a great big tax on the necessities of daily life. That in the absence of comparable action from other

countries would be entirely futile and that’s why our policies will make sense in a way that the Government's

policy doesn't.

CHRIS UHLMANN:

But it won’t be cost free.

TONY ABBOTT:

Of course it won’t be cost free but nevertheless there is a lot that you can do to reduce emissions and improve

the environment that will fund itself.

CHRIS UHLMANN:

So it wont be a great big tax, it might be a medium sized tax, it’s a tax you can’t put a number on?

TONY ABBOTT:

What we will do is fund sensible action, direct action on the environment from the budget in the ordinary way.

CHRIS UHLMANN:

But that might mean you might have to change some regulation in order to force change and that will impose cost

on business and that will be passed on to people.

TONY ABBOTT:

Yeah but what we are not going to do is impose a great big tax on daily life that won't actually improve the

environment.

CHRIS UHLMANN:

Do you think you will be credible on climate change? Clearly the electorate wants something done about this.

TONY ABBOTT:

And I think that the Coalition in government, both under Mr Howard and Mr Fraser, were very credible in practical

terms on the environment. And I intend to maintain a strong record in practical environmentalism. I regard myself

as an environmentalist. My first action in Government was to create the Green corps which mobilised thousands

of young people for practical environmental restoration work and the interesting thing about the Rudd

Government is that it’s basically wasted its first two years when it comes to environmental problems here in

Australia that we can actually make a difference to because of its pre occupation with climate change.

CHRIS UHLMANN:

Will you really turn back the boats of refugees?

TONY ABBOTT:

We will take strong action on border security. Now, that is not something turning boats back is not something that

you would do lightly or necessarily frequently, but you've got to have that option at your disposal.

CHRIS UHLMANN:

What if they sink their boats?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well we would look at each circumstance, each situation on its own merits but you've got to have the option and

what you have to understand Chris is that John Howard found a problem, created a collusion, Mr Rudd found a

solution and created a problem.

CHRIS UHLMANN:

Is two thousand eight hundred refugees though really a crisis? Do you really need to launch a campaign against

these people?

TONY ABBOTT:

And I understand that the individuals themselves are in many case s decent people seeking a better life. But

sovereign countries have to control their own boarders. They cannot be exposed to what amounts to peaceful

invasion. The truth is that we have to take strong action to secure the boarders. Mr Rudd has signally failed to do.

So if we're in Government, look at us on our record. We will take strong action. strong action.

CHRIS UHLMANN:

Do you favour Chinese investment in Australian companies because it appears your Finance spokesman

doesn’t?

TONY ABBOTT:

I am in favour of appropriate foreign investment, what I am not in favour is of nationalisation of Australian

industries and if I don't support Australian Government ownership of Australian industries under most

circumstances, I would certainly be pretty wary about Chinese government ownership of Australian businesses.

CHRIS UHLMANN:

That’s the way this investment comes isn’t it? Do you want that investment in Australia or not?

TONY ABBOTT:

That’s why This takes a sensible and balanced approach to this.

CHRIS UHLMANN:

Now, I see that you have put Cory Bernadi to advise you on population policy. Kevin Rudd says that he wants a

big Australia. Thirty five million people by 2050. Is that what you want to see?

TONY ABBOTT:

I want to see a strong Australia. I want to see Australian families looking to the future with confidence and I think

that families look to the future with confidence will tend to have more kids. I am all in favour of that. If I also want

Australia to continue to be a country which is welcoming to migrants, people have got to understand that when

they come here they're joining our team. But with Australian families looking to have more kids and a continued

sensible immigration policy in Australia's national interests I think will be a bigger countries in the years to come.

CHRIS UHLMANN:

Tony Abbot we know what you are against. What are you for? What would an Australia with Tony Abbott as

Prime Minister look like?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well perhaps people who are in some doubt ought to read my book. Battlelines which came out last year.

CHRIS UHLMANN:

Those that don’t have the moment, the time?

TONY ABBOTT:

If you look at the book what you will see is that I want to see an Australia which has more confidence, more

strength, more prosperity but in particular I want to see a fair go for families. I want to see more patient-centred

health care. I want to see more patient power in our health system that means local boards running hospitals. I

want to see more parent power in our education system. That means local boards having more influence over

schools. I am in favour of democracy and of empowering the Australian public. You look at Kevin Rudd contrast,

what he likes is big bureaucracy, big unions and great big taxes.

CHRIS UHLMANN:

Finally and very briefly, Kevin Rudd is it personal between Rudd is it personal between you and him. You don't

seem to like him very much?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look he is my opponent. He might be the best bloke in the country, he might bloke in the country, he might be a

fantastic author of children's books but the fact is he is my opponent so I am not in the business of looking at his

good personal qualities. I am in the business of exposing his poor political qualities.

CHRIS UHLMANN:

Tony Abbott, thank you.

TONY ABBOTT:

Thanks Chris.
