OPENING ADDRESS FROM THE MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND

ETHNIC AFFAIRS, AT THE SECOND BIENNIAL MEETING OF MEMBERS

OF THE AUSTRALIAN INSTITUTE OF MULTICULTURAL AFFAIRS -

17 OCTOBER 1983

I WAS PLEASED TO ACCEPT THE INVITATION TO OPEN THIS SECOND

BIENNI'AL MEETING OF MEMBERS OF Ã‘ÃÂÃÂÃ‘. I REGRET THAT, DUE TO

PRESSING CABINET RESPONSIBILITIES, I CANNOT PERSONALLY ATTEND,

AND HAVE ASKED BILL MCKINNQN TO DELIVER THIS ADDRESS ON MY

BEHALF. Ã¢ÂÂ   Ã¢ÂÂ

AT THE FIRST 'BIENNIAL MEETING Of  MEMBERS,  THE NON-EXECUTIVE

ROLE OF MEMBERS WAS DESCRIBED AS VITAL IN PROVIDING A TWO-WAY

CHANNEL O F .COMMUNICATION; FIRSTLY TO SERVE AS A SOURCE OF

KNOWLEDGE FOR THE INSTITUTE ON COMMUNITY NEEDS AND PERCEPTIONS,

AND SECONDLY, TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF MULTICULTURAL

AUSTRALIA THROUGH THE PEOPLE WITH WHOM THEY MEET AND WORK IN

THEIR LIVES,  .

THESE BIENNIAL MEETINGS OF MEMBERS HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO PLAY

AN IMPORTANT PART IN THE LIFE OF THE INSTITUTE AND IN THE

EFFECTIVENESS OF ITS WORK.

THE WHITLAM LABOR GOVERNMENT QUjTE RIGHTLY, MADE THE DECISION

TO OFFICIALLY ACKNOWLEDGE AUSTRALIA AS A MULTICULTURAL SOCIETY,

AND DEVELOP POLICIES ACCORDINGLY.

THE ALP 1983 STATEMENT ON "IMMIGRATION AND COMMUNITY RELATIONS"

STATES - .  .

"OUR POLICIES ARE BASED ON THE BELIEF THAT

AUSTRALIA HAS BECOME A MULTICULTURAL SOCIETY AND

THAT EACH ETHNIC COMMUNITY HAS A RIGHT, WITHOUT

DISCRIMINATION, TO THE RETENTION AND DEVELOPMENT

OF ITS CULTURE, LANGUAGE AND LIFESTYLE AS PART OF

THE AUSTRALIAN NATION. THE LABOR PARTY IN GOVERNMENT

WILL MAINTAIN AND DEVELOP ITS STRONG COMMITMENT TO

ETHNIC COMMUNITIES' DEVELOPMENT AND TO THE RECOGNITION

OF THE SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTION WHICH IS MADE BY THEM

TO OUR SOCIETY".

THE POLICY STATEMENT ALSO EMPHASISED THAT IT WAS THE GOVERNMENT'S

RESPONSIBILITY TO ASSIST MIGRANTS IN ESTABLISHING THEMSELVES

WITH THE SAME RIGHTS, OPPORTUNITIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES AS

ALL'AUSTRALIANS. IT STATED -

"PARTICIPATION OF THESE SETTLERS IN AUSTRALIAN

SOCIETY AT THE LEVEL DESIRED BY THEM MUST BE

FACILITATED IN EVERY POSSIBLE WAY".

THE IMPORTANCE OF MULTICULTURALISM WAS ALSO STRESSED IN THE

COMMUNIQUE OF THE NATIONAL ECONOMIC SUMMIT HELD IN APRIL 1983

WHICH DECLARED THAT "THERE IS ACCEPTANCE THAT THE FUTURE

WELL-BEING OF THIS COUNTRY DEPENDS UPON THE ACCEPTANCE OF THE

CULTURAL, SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC IMPLICATIONS OF A MULTICULTURAL

AUSTRALIA".  "

. ./3

IT IS USEFUL TO RECALL THAT IN CONSIDERING MULTICULTURAL AND

COMMUNITY RELATIONS ISSUES, WE ARE LOOKING AT ALL AREAS OF

AUSTRALIAN SOCIETY AND AT THE ADEQUACY OF THOSE RESOURCES TO

RESPOND TO COMMUNITY NEEDS - THROUGH COMMONWEALTH AND STATE/

TERRITORIAL GOVERNMENTS, THROUGH LOCAL GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES,

BUSINESS ORGANISATIONS, EMPLOYER AND EMPLOYEE GROUPS,  AND

THE VOLUNTARY SECTOR.

AGAINST THE BACKGROUND OF THESE POLICY COMMITMENTS,  I WANT

TO REASSURE YOU THAT THE GOVERNMENT'S DECISION TO UNDERTAKE

THE REVIEW OF THE OPERATION AND ADMINISTRATION OF AIMA DOES

NOT DETRACT IN ANY WAY WHATSOEVER FROM THE GOVERNMENT’S

COMMITMENT TO PROVIDE POLICIES AND TAKE OTHER INITIATIVES

WHICH RECOGNISE THE REALITY OF AUSTRALIAN SOCIETY AND THE NEED

FOR GENERAL -COMMUNITY UNDERSTANDING AND ACCEPTANCE OF THAT

REALITY.

AS AN EXAMPLE OF THAT COMMITMENT, THE GOVERNMENT HAS ADOPTED

A POLICY OF MAINSTREAMING COMMONWEALTH SERVICES AND PROGRAMS

TO MIGRANTS.

UNDER THIS POLICY, THE NEEDS OF MIGRANTS SHOULD BE MET WHEREVER

POSSIBLE BY PROGRAMS AND SERVICES AVAILABLE TO THE COMMUNITY

AT LARGE. THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE TAKING ACTION TO ENSURE THAT

RELEVANT COMMONWEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND AUTHORITIES SPEED UP

ADJUSTMENTS TO GENERAL PROGRAMS FOR WHICH THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE.

. . / A  .

AT THE SAME TIME, THE GOVERNMENT RECONGISES THE NEED FOR .

SPECIAL SERVICES AND PROGRAMS FOR MIGRANTS TO CONTINUE, ’

WHERE NECESSARY, AND TO PROVIDE EQUALITY OF ACCESS TO SERVICES

AND BENEFITS FOR MIGRANTS. .

SINCE THE LABOR GOVERNMENT ASSUMED OFFICE IN MARCH 1983 I .

HAVE TAKEN A NUMBER OF MAJOR INITIATIVES IN RELATION TO .

IMMIGRATION AND ETHNIC AFFAIRS POLICIES AND PROGRAMS.

I WILL SUMMARISE THESE TO GIVE MEMBERS AN APPRECIATION OF THE

NEW DIRECTION IN MY PORTFOLIO RESPONSIBILITIES AND COMMITMENTS.

THE MAJOR DEVELOPMENTS HAVE BEEN : .

.  THE REVIEW OF PRIORITIES AND SIZE OF THE IMMIGRATION

PROGRAM; '

.  .  RESTRUCTURING OF THE POINTS SYSTEM USED FOR MIGRANT.

SEL ECTION TO ELIMINATE ITS MORE DISCRIMINATORY FEATURES;.

.  INCREASE IN AND BROADENING OF THE REFUGEE INTAKE;

.  PREVENTING VISITORS, STUDENTS AND WORKING HOLIDAY MAKERS

IN AUSTRALIA CHANGING STATUS TO PERMANENT RESIDENTS;

.  REVIEW OF THE CITIZENSHIP ACT AND DRAFTING OF AN

*Â· AMENDING BILL WHICH I HOPE TO INTRODUCE LATER IN THE

CURRENT PARLIAMENTARY SESSION;

/  5

LEGISLATION TO REFORM THE MIGRATION ACT TO PUT ALL

NON-AUSTRALIAN CITIZENS ON AN EQUAL BASIS;

INCREASE OF OVER 50Z IN FUNDING FOR THE GRANT-IN-AID

SCHEME FOR SOCIAL WELFARE WORKERS;

.  43% INCREASE IN FUNDING FOR MIGRANT RESOURCE CENTRES;

.  ACTION; TO CREATE AND STAFF PERMANENT POSITIONS IN

THE ADULT MIGRANT EDUCATION SERVICE; "

.  25% EXPANSION IN FUNDING FOR ENGLISH LANGUAGE NEEDS

OF MIGRANTS IN THE WORKFORCE;

.  LAUNCHING OF A NATIONAL WOMEN'S EMERGENCY SERVICES

PROGRAM, INCLUDING A SPECIAL COMPONENT OF $200,000

TO ASSIST MIGRANT WOMEN; Ã¢ÂÂ

.  ESTABLISHMENT OF A MIGRANT WOMEN'S DESK IN THE

DEPARTMENT OF IMMIGRATION AND ETHNIC AFFAIRS; .

.  APPOINTMENT OF A COMMITTEE OF REVIEW OF OVERSEAS STUDENTS

POLICY;

.  AND FINALLY, APPOINTMENT OF THE COMMITTEE OF REVIEW OF AIMA

AN

THE CURRENT REVIEW OF THE INSTITUTE, UNDERTAKEN BY/INDEPENDENT

COMMITTEE UNDER THE CHAIRMANSHIP OF DR MOSS CASS IS A MATTER

WHICH IS, NO DOUBT,  HIGH ON THE AGENDA OF MATTERS OF IMMEDIATE

INTEREST TO YOU.

THE GOVERNMENT'S DECISION TO REVIEW THE OPERATION AND

ADMINISTRATION OF THE INSTITUTE, WHICH I ANNOUNCED ON

24 JULY 1983, GIVES EFFECT TO THE PRE-ELECTION COMMITMENT

BY THE ALP IN THE "IMMIGRATION AND COMMUNITY RELATIONS"

POLICY STATEMENT.

THE REVIEW WILL HELP GIVE EFFECT TO THE GOVERNMENT'  S COMMITMENT*

TO MULTI CULTURAL ISM IN THE COMMUNIQUE OF THE ECONOMIC SUMMIT.

THE REVIEW ALSO REFLECTS THE GOVERNMENT'S CONCERN TO SEE THAT

THE ADMINISTRATIVE ARRANGEMENTS TO IMPLEMENT ITS MULTICULTURAL

AND COMMUNITY RELATIONS POLICIES MOST EFFECTIVELY MEET THE

NEEDS OF BOTH MIGRANT GROUPS AND THE COMMUNITY GENERALLY.

THE MEMBERSHIP OF THE COMMITTEE OF REVIEW OF AIMA AND THE

BRIEF PERIOD OF THREE MONTHS IN WHICH I HAVE ASKED THE

COMMITTEE TO REPORT,  HAVE ATTRACTED SOME PUBLIC CRITICISM.

I THEREFORE TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO CLARIFY THE GOVERNMENT'S

POSITION ON THESE MATTERS.

THE GOVERNMENT RECOGNISES THE IMPORTANCE OF THE REVIEW OF

AIMA FOR THE FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF MULTICULTURALISM IN

AUSTRALIA. THE GOVERNMENT WAS, THEREFORE,  MINDFUL OF THE

NEED, WHEN CONSIDERING THE COMPOSITION OF THE COMMITTEE,

TO OBTAIN AN APPROPRIATE BALANCE OF EXPERTISE AND INTERESTS.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Â·/?

I HAVE RECEIVED REPRESENTATIONS THAT THE FAILURE OF THE

GOVERNMENT TO CONSULT WITH ETHNIC COMMUNITIES BEFORE

APPOINTMENTS TO THE COMMITTEE OF REVIEW WERE MADE INDICATED

A LACK OF COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO EFFECTIVE CONSULTATION

THIS IS QUITE UNTRIJE.  HOWEVER, IT NEEDS TO BE RECOGNISED

THAT CONSULTATIONS WITH ETHNIC AND OTHER RELEVANT COMMUNITY

ORGANISATIONS THROUGHOUT AUSTRALIA ON APPOINTMENTS TO THE

COMMITTEE OF REVIEW WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN PRACTICABLE OR

PRODUCED A CONSENSUS OF OPINION. THE GOVERNMENT IS CONFIDENT

THAT THE COMMITTEE IS SUITABLY QUALIFIED FOR THE TASK OF

UNDERTAKING THE REVIEW, AND THAT IT IS DOING SO IN A FAIR

AND EQUITABLE MANNER.

DR CASS HAS ADVISED ME THAT THE COMMITTEE HAS RECEIVED OVER

A00 WRITTEN SUBMISSIONS AND HAS HAD CONSULTATIONS WITH IN

EXCESS OF250 ORGANISATIONS AND INDIVIDUALS. THIS IS A VERY

ENCOURAGING RESPONSE, AND ONE WHICH HAS GIVEN THE COMMITTEE

THE OPPORTUNITY TO OBTAIN AN ESSENTIAL AND VALUABLE '

CONTRIBUTION INTO ITS DELIBERATIONS.

i

I NOW REFER TO THE IMPORTANT ISSUE OF COMMUNITY RELATIONS

IN AUSTRALIA.

THE ALP POLICY STATEMENT ON "IMMIGRATION AND COMMUNITY

RELATIONS" STATED THAT -

/  8

"i m p r o v e d  c o m m u n i t y  r e l a t i o n s ;  t h e  r e l a t i o n s h i p s

OF PARTICULAR.ETHNIC 'GROUPS, WHETHER ENGLISH SPEAKING

OR N O T ,  WITH ALL SECTIONS OF THE COMMUNITY, MUST BE .  .

POSITIVELY ENCOURAGED AND ANY MEASURES TAKEN MUST BE

ADMINISTERED WITH FLEXIBILITY AND AN UNDERSTANDING OF

THE ETHNIC DIVERSITY OF THE POPULATION” .

THE CLOSE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MULTICULTURALISM AND COMMUNITY

RELATIONS MUST BE CONSTANTLY KEPT IN MIND IN THE DEVELOPMENT

AND IMPLEMENTATION OF POLICY. COMMUNITY EDUCATION HAS AN

IMPORTANT ROLE AS THE BRIDGE BETWEEN MULTICULTURAL!SM AND

COMMUNITY RELATIONS.

IN THIS CONTEXT, I INTERPRET "COMMUNITY EDUCATION" TO INCLUDE

THE PROMOTION OF COMMUNITY AWARENESS OF THE DIVERSITY OF ETHNIC

AND RACIAL COMPOSITION, THE RATIONALE FOR AND CONTENT OF

ETHNIC AFFAIRS AND MULTICULTURAL POLICIES AND INITIATIVES,

AND, COMMUNITY RESPONSES AND ACCEPTANCE OF THE REALITY OF ETHNIC

AND RACIAL DIVERSITY.

THE NEED FOR SUCH COMMUNITY EDUCATION WAS, FOR EXAMPLE,  ^

INDICATED IN THE DISCUSSION PAPER "MULTICULTURALISM FOR ALL

AUSTRALIANS", PUBLISHED LAST YEAR BY THE AUSTRALIAN COUNCIL

ON POPULATION AND ETHNIC AFFAIRS.

THAT PAPER MADE A NUMBER OF POINTS WHICH ARE PARTICULARLY

RELEVANT,  INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING OBSERVATIONS:  -

'  ÃÂ¯ Â»

../8

../9

- FIRSTLY, THERE IS STILL WIDESPREAD UNCERTAINTY

AND SOME SUSPICION, IN THE PUBLIC MIND ABOUT THE

MEANING OF MULTICULTURALISM FOR AUSTRALIAN SOCIETY;

- SECONDLY, THE NEED FOR SOCIETY TO' ACCEPT

’  IMPLICATIONS OF MULTICULTURAL!SM;

- THIRDLY, MULTICULTURALISM REQUIRES A GOVERNMENT

COMMITMENT, AND POLICIES AND PROGRAMS TO GIVE

EFFECT TO THAT COMMITMENT;

- FOURTHLY, THE NECESSITY OF COMMUNITY SUPPORT AND

PARTI CIPATION TO ENSURE THAT MULTI CULTURALISM

BECOMES MORE THAN JUST A REFLECTION OF AUSTRALIAN

DEMOGRAPHIC HISTORY OR AN ITEM OR GOVERNMENT POLICY.

THE PAST SIXTEEN MONTHS SINCE THE RELEASE OF THAT DISCUSSION

PAPER HAVE SHOWN SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE OF CONTINUING COMMUNITY

DEBATE ON THE DIRECTIONS OF MULTICULTURAL POLICIES AND

INITIATIVES.

FOR EXAMPLE, THE HON MR JUSTICE KIRBY IN AN ADDRESS GIVEN AT

A SEMINAR HELD IN JUNE 1983 BY THE ETHNIC AFFAIRS COMMISSION

OF NEW SOUTH WALES, CRITICISED THE COUNCIL'S PROPOSITION THAT

A SUCCESSFUL MULTICULTURAL SOCIETY REQUIRES EQUAL RESPONSIBILITY

FOR, COMMITMENT TO, AND PARTICIPATION IN THAT SOCIETY. INSTEAD, HE

CLAIMED THAT THE ESSENCE OF A FREE AND TOLERANT SOCIETY, SUCH

AS AUSTRALIA, WAS THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN THE COMMUNITY OR

NOT TO PARTICIPATE.

. / ÃÂ¯ ÃÂ¿  ,

MICHAEL LIFFKAN, UNDER THE HEADING ’’ MULTICULTURALISM:

WHERE.TO, WITHÂ· WHOM - AND WHY?", STATED THAT:

''MULTICULTURAL15M IS BARELY CLOSER TODAY THAN IT

WAS TEN YEARS AGO TO HAVING A COHERENT THEORETICAL

AND PRACTICAL CONTENT, OR A MEANING WHICH IS

GENUINELY UNDERSTOOD AND AGREED UPON BY EITHER ITS

ADVOCATES OR ITS OPPONENTS, LET ALONE THE COMMUNITY

AT LARGE".  v  ’

WE ALSO HAVE THE WARNING, GIVEN BY PROFESSOR JERZY ZUBRZYCKI

LAST YEAR THAT A MULTICULTURAL AUSTRALIA "IS THE ONE VIABLE

OPTION WHICH MUST BE PURSUED IF WE ARE TO AVOID THE COMMUNAL

DISORDERS THAT HAVE PLAGUED OTHER PLURALISTIC COUNTRIES".

COMMUNITY DEBATE ON THESE ISSUES IS OF VITAL IMPORTANCE FOR

THE FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF MULTICULTURALISM.

FOR THAT REASON, I ALSO LOOK FORWARD T O .THE OUTCOME OF THE

REVIEW OF AIMA AS, NO DOUBT, IT WILL ADD TO THE DEBATE ON

THE FUTURE DIRECTIONS OF MULTICULTURALISM IN AUSTRALIA.

IN CLOSING MAY I EXPRESS MY APPRECIATION FOR THE TIME AND

EFFORT YOU HAVE GIVEN TO FULFILLING YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES

AS MEMBERS OF THE INSTITUTE. .
