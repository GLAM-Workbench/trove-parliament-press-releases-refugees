AUSTRALIA’S CHANCE TO PROVIDE REGIONAL LEADERSHIP ON ROHINGYA  CRISIS

At today’s Rohingya crisis meeting in Bangkok Australia has an opportunity to provide  leadership and initiate practical steps to assist in humanitarian efforts to save lives.

“As one of the wealthiest countries in the region Australia needs to play a leading role at the  Rohingya crisis talks and not rely solely on our neighbours to help and resettle refugees  stranded in the South East Asian waters”, Greens spokesperson for Immigration Senator Sarah  Hanson-Young said.

“Australia’s initial lack of an immediate and proactive response to the crisis continues to damage  our international reputation and the crisis talks provide an opportunity to remedy this.

“The Australian Greens support the call from the Refugee Council of Australia for the  government to initiate the following five initiatives at the talks:

1: Offer logistical and financial assistance to nations rescuing boat arrivals.

2: Negotiate resettlement places for refugees:

3: Encourage dialogue and commit financial resources to addressing causes of migrant and  refugee flows.

4: Increase diplomatic pressure on Burma to address persecution of Rohingya people.

5: Advocate for the establishment of UN human rights presence in Burma.
