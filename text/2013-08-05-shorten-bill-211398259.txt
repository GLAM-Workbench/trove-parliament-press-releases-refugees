JON FAINE:                                      Bill Shorten, good morning to you.

BILL SHORTEN:                             Good morning John.

JON FAINE:                                      Why should anyone vote for the Labor Party

after what Tony Abbott says has been years of dysfunction, and a Parliament  that he says hasn't worked?

BILL SHORTEN:                             Because the Labor Party's got the best policy  to create and maintain jobs. We've got the best  policies to look after our schools. We've got the  best policies to raise people's superannuation  so they don't retire poor. And we're the ones  who are driving social justice by introducing a  national disability insurance scheme.

JON FAINE:                                      And you've got a credibility problem of

course now after the way Julia Gillard was  treated- and is it Labor Party policy to not  mention her name throughout this campaign?

BILL SHORTEN:                             Not at all. I think Julia Gillard did a great job

in a lot of areas, and in particular I've had the  privilege of taking up the baton in the relay  about getting Better Schools, which we were  able to announce yesterday morning. I mean,  what does it say about the Coalition, that after  three years of bagging our education reforms,  three years, as late as last Thursday their  Shadow Minister said that it was all a con.  Then on Friday they realised that the Liberal  Party have got a complete credibility gap in  terms of education, so the Coalition said last

Friday “oh, we'll give the money to the States  with no strings attached”.

The Federal Government - Labor - wants to  provide greater resources for our schools so  kids get the best start, but what we're also  doing is saying that we want to see a needs-based funding model. We want to see the  States put some money in. I'm pleased that  after Friday's completely implausible Coalition  policy-

JON FAINE:                                      Is it party policy to not mention her name

throughout this campaign?

BILL SHORTEN:                             Not at all. I think Julia Gillard did a great job

in a lot of areas and, in particular, I've had the  privilege of taking up the baton in the relay  about getting Better Schools, which we were  able to announce yesterday morning.

JON FAINE:                                      You've both got a credibility gap when it

comes to these sorts of issues.  Yes, they've  got a problem to explain how they've suddenly  done a U-turn on education.  But you've got to  explain how you've done such a U-turn on  asylum seeks and boats.

BILL SHORTEN:                             Well, just on your assumption that we've both  got a credibility problem on education, how can that be-

JON FAINE:                                      No, no, on different issues.

BILL SHORTEN:                             Alright, well, thanks.

JON FAINE:                                      Theirs is on education. Yours is on boats

and asylum seekers.

BILL SHORTEN:                             Well, I appreciate you recognising that we  don't have a credibility problem on education,  and that means that a parent of every child  who goes to a school in Victoria should know  that when you vote Labor, what you get is  custodians nationally who are fundamentally  interested in their kids getting the best start in  life.

In terms of the boats issue, there is no doubt  that the people smugglers are testing the

resolve of exploiting people in what could only  be characterised as mass drownings, by  holding out the promise that if you get to  Australia you'll be resettled here. It is not an  easy issue. It is not an easy issue.

JON FAINE:                                      No but aren't we entitled to ask, what do you

all stand for when you clearly-

BILL SHORTEN:                             That’s right-

JON FAINE:                                      Well, you're prepared to change whatever

you believe in on boats. They're prepared to change whatever they believe in on  education.

BILL SHORTEN:                             Well, wait a second.  In terms of boats, we

wanted to put forward a solution which would  have seen people processed in a regional  settlement in Malaysia, which the Liberals and  the Greens knocked off.  So we've been  pushing regional resettlement for quite a while.

Anyone knows that the people smugglers, the  criminal syndicates in Indonesia, are selling a  promise that yeah, you may drown.  But if you  don't drown you can get a permanent life in  Australia.  We need to break that.  I cannot be  party to a system which says that with the new  criminal syndicates pushing hard, that  somehow allowing mass drownings and call it -  it's better to be faux humanitarian and saying  people can get here and we want to be  humanitarian and instead, risk people  drowning.

If we knew that the MCG- if we knew the Grand  Final would see 4000 people out of 100,000  who attend, that they’d die on the way to  getting to the Grand Final, you wouldn’t call it  humanitarian to say keep the match going,  would you?

So we need to challenge our policies and if that  means doing a regional resettlement  agreement with PNG, in the long run that is the  most humanitarian outcome.

JON FAINE:                                      The issues on the environment, on

economy, on health, on education, all of these,

of course, pale into insignificance, compared to  leadership.  Now, you have all sorts of  confusing messages on leadership.  Sure,  Kevin Rudd is more popular than Julia Gillard.   But do you really think the electorate have  forgotten everything that went on?

BILL SHORTEN:                             I believe that when you look at the

competition between Kevin Rudd and Tony  Abbott, the people who want you to forget what  the leader is like are actually the Liberal Party  of Australia.

I think any person watching Tony Abbott knows  that everything that they say is a focus group  scripted remark.  We know that the Libs, if they  get into power nationally, the only way they can  pay for their $70 billion black hole is if they  keep making up policies and not explaining  how they'll pay for them, such as their false  position on education.

We know that the only way the Libs can do that  is by cutting, cutting services, not moderately,  but by cutting to the bone. They're proposing  thousands of job losses. They're proposing  abandoning the car industry.  They are  proposing - when they get in they will no doubt  say oh, we need to have a Commission of  Inquiry about the finances.

They'll then use that to say listen, we didn't -  we couldn't tell you before the election, but  gee, what a surprise, we are going to cut  health and education services to the bone.  These guys haven't done the homework in  Opposition. They've relied on the minority  Parliament and all the tough debates, to just  skate them into Government. They haven't  done their homework. They're not ready to  govern Australia.

JON FAINE:                                      And then in New South Wales, just finally,

the ICAC report suggests that the Labor brand  is utterly toxic. That's not been ignored around  the rest of the country and surely, that is an  inexplicable state of affairs for the Labor Party.

Every time it's raised everyone just roll their  eyes and you lose more votes.

BILL SHORTEN:                             It is completely hopeless conduct by those  people. It's more than hopeless. It's illegal. I  note that- Kevin Rudd and all of us in Federal  Labor, have made it clear that we've obviously  got no time for that corruption.

I know that several business leaders have also  been - had adverse findings against them.  Conduct by business people, politicians or  anyone else of that nature, is completely wrong  and no-one has any time for it.  I certainly don't  think that represents the whole of the Labor  Party or the Liberal Party or the business  community.

But this conduct by these people is appalling,  reprehensible.  Kevin Rudd has stepped into  New South Wales Labor.  He's intervened.  We've also changed the way we're picking our  leader. We want to be very clear that politics in  the future has to be from the ground up,  involving people. That is why we encourage  people to join the Labor Party, have a say in  your political processes. This election needs  every person who is interested in progressive  politics to get involved.

JON FAINE:                                      And just finally, finally - I know it's my

second finally.

BILL SHORTEN:                             That's okay.

JON FAINE:                                      The front page of The Daily Telegraph today

says Throw this Mob Out. The Murdoch  tabloids and The Australian, the Murdoch  newspaper empire, undoubtedly now  campaigning against the Government. What's  your response to that?

BILL SHORTEN:                             Well, just because some vested interests  don't like the Labor Party, in my opinion, makes  it more important than ever that we have a  balanced media and it makes it more important  than ever that Labor's returned.

If some vested interest wants to see Labor  thrown out, you've got to ask yourself why do  they want that?  Is it for the interests of the little  person or is it for the interests of big business?   There is no doubt that the Liberal Party have  raised a lot more money from business than  Labor can or is going to.

So what is clear to me is that part of this  election is about making sure that we have Australia  governed for all, not just the interests of some.

JON FAINE:                                      My time is up and your call is - your time is

very much required elsewhere for the meeting  that Kevin Rudd has called, somewhat oddly,  on the first day of an election campaign. Thank  you for joining us from our Canberra studios  this morning.

BILL SHORTEN:                             Thanks Jon.  I look forward to being back in

Melbourne this afternoon.
