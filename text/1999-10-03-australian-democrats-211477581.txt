New migrants denied welfare benefits

highlighted by AUSTCARE Media Awards

Â

The AUSTCARE Media Awards highlighted the positive role the media 
ca n play in enhancing understanding of the situation of refugees, 
according to Senator Andrew Bartlett, the Australian Democrats’ spokesperson 
on immigration and multiculturalism.

Â

The winner of the AUSTCARE Media Awards was Sydney 
journalist David Leser for an article about changes to the law regarding 
migrants’ access to welfare benefits including the Special Benefit, 
called “Welcome to Australia” which was printed in the Sydney Morning 
Herald Weekend Australian magazine.

Â

Senator Bartlett said the award should encourage the 
Government to reinstate Special Benefits for migrants.

Â

“Through the media Australians are made aware of 
the human impact of government decisions.”

Â

As mentioned in the article, the Democrats opposed 
the introduction of the two year waiting period for newly arrived migrants 
for all social security benefits including the ‘last resort’ special 
benefit. This measure built on the six month waiting period initially 
introduced by the Labor Party.

Â

After hearing many stories of newly arrived migrants 
suffering from malnutrition, unable to access safe or suitable accommodation 
and unable to afford to care for or adequately feed their children, 
the Democrats moved an amendment to have the Special Benefit exempted 
from the two year waiting period in the Senate. Labor and the government 
opposed this amendment.

Â

The awards, held last night, recognise outstanding 
contributions in generating awareness of the plight of refugees. Senator 
Bartlett presented the award in the radio category.

Â

“It is through the media that most Australians become 
aware of what is happening to refugees or new migrants living in their 
own communities,” said Senator Bartlett.
