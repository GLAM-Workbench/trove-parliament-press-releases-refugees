AUSTRALIA AID TO REFUGEES IN INDO-CHINA .

The Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr Whitlam, announced

today that a contribution of $200,000 was being given as an initial

response to an urgent appeal from the International Committee of

the Red Cross for funds to assist its Indo-China Operational Group

in making purchases for refugees in Cambodia and Vietnam. A

cheque for this amount was given to the President of ICRC by the

Minister of Foreign Affairs, Senator Willesee, in Geneva yesterday.

The Australian Government is giving money to the ICRC and

similar organisations because they are uniquely qualified to assist

refugees on both sides of, the existing lines of military control.

Clear information about the requirements of the vast numbers

of displaced persons in Cambodia and Vietnam is difficult to obtain.

under present circumstances but the immediate cash grant will allow

purchases of food, tents and medical supplies. As the situation

develops, Australia will look sympathetically at the possibility of

giving further aid through the Red Cross and similar organisations.

Mr Whitlam commended the extremely valuable work being carried

out by the Red Cross and by other multilateral organisations in

the very difficult conditions in Indo-China. Earlier contributions

to the Red Cross for Indo-China relief made by Australia were

$277,000 in 1973/74 and $100,000 in November 1974. Contributions

were also made in November last to the United Nations High Commissioner

for Refugees ($500,000) and to UNICEF ($400,000).

Mr Whitlam said that the Australian Government was in close

contact with all the international humanitarian organisations caring

for refugees in Vietnam and Cambodia and he anticipated that

substantial further contributions would be made by Australia if the

situation so required.
