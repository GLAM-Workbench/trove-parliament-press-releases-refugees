KIERAN GILBERT: With me this morning, the Trade Minister Craig

Emerson, also the Acting Foreign Minister. Good  morning to you.

CRAIG EMERSON: G'day Kieran.

GILBERT: We'll be joined by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition

in the Senate, the Shadow Attorney-General Senator  Brandis, in a moment. But first I want to ask you about  this vote. It's going down to the wire isn't it?

EMERSON: It is and it's an important vote fundamentally in that

obviously the world is looking to the United States to  see that it can manage its fiscal position.







The short-term effect of this Kieran is, in fact,

contractionary, because compared with the situation  that would otherwise apply they're talking about cutting  spending. So the economy in the United States is very  sluggish in any event and they're cutting spending. But  the confidence that that's expected to give to the  business community about the future is designed to  counteract that short-term contractionary effect for an  overall better result…

GILBERT: But it could be too late…

EMERSON: …not only for the US economy but for the world.

GILBERT: But it could be too late anyway for the United StatesÃ¢ÂÂ

Triple A credit rating.

EMERSON: That's up to the ratings agencies. And I'm sure that the

Administration and the Republicans will, you know,  reflect on a period of great uncertainty. I think the  Republicans put up their bill and it failed. The  Democrats put up their bill and it failed, as much to  convince their own side that their own wishes could not  be fulfilled but that a genuine compromise was needed.  And that's what this bill is, a genuine compromise.

GILBERT: And we're just … we're waiting for this vote to take

place any moment now, and we've got live pictures  from the Congress as we speak. The Wall Street  Journal, Mr Emerson, describes the deal as a Tea  Party triumph. The … the New York Times have  slammed it as a terrible deal.  Are they … very strong  criticisms in the US media. The President certainly had  to compromise a lot on this package, hasn't he?







EMERSON: Well, that's right. And while I'm not an expert in Tea

Party politics, I can't imagine the Tea Party got  everything it wanted, which would be a very severe  fiscal contraction. And the leadership of the  Republicans worked very hard to get enough  Republican votes.

Now if this went through unanimously that would be a

very pleasant surprise. But what was going on is that  neither side could muster enough votes to get the  legislation through. The very fact that they are now  debating this in full in the House of Reps - I think it was  a one hour debate, followed by a Senate debate -  would convey a fair bit of confidence that they have  now got onside a sufficient number of Democrats and a  sufficient number of Republicans to get it through both  houses.

GILBERT: So you're feeling confident about that this morning?

That's certainly the mood there.

EMERSON: Well I think the evidence … the evidence is that they

wouldn't be having these debates right now if it was  just a lottery and no-one had any idea of how it was  going to unfold. They've already been through the  processes of putting up their preferred compromised  bills and neither of those got up. And this is their sort of  compromise-compromise bill that is designed to get  enough votes to get through both houses.

GILBERT: And just reading online, a few of the analysis on The

Washington Post and elsewhere, that's certainly the  mood: that they feel that they've got the numbers.  We're going to take you to that as soon as it happens,  that vote on the floor on the House of … the House of  Representatives and the Senate in the US Congress.  So stay with us for live rolling coverage of that.







Let's … in the meantime while we wait for that vote,

Minister, can I ask you about the Reserve Bank  meeting today. Given all of the international  uncertainty, not just in the United States but the  European debt crisis and other issues around the  globe, would you expect the RBA to keep rates on hold  today?

EMERSON: Well as you know, I'm obliged as a Minister not to

speculate about Reserve Bank interest rate  movements. I can talk about some of the variables that  are in play here.

I think the global uncertainty - which is not only related,

Kieran, to the United States but to the situation in  Greece and other parts of Europe - has created a  sense of gloom around the world, which actually is  spilling into Australia; that even small businesses and  farmers are reflecting on what's happening in Greece.  And I think what that tells us is the global financial  crisis that then created a recession, a global recession,  has enlivened people here in Australia to what's going  on around the world, because they're aware of how  this contagion can spread.

The good news here in Australia is that we're not in

that sort of fiscal position. Our debt will peak at just  over 6 per cent of GDP. Across the major advanced  countries, it is 75 per cent of GDP. WeÃ¢ÂÂll be back in  surplus in 2012-13: the fastest fiscal consolidation in  Australia's history and ahead of all those other  countries. But it is true that people do look at what's  going on around the world. That could be having an  effect on retail sales here and general consumer  optimism. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs one of the matters that the Reserve  Bank will take into account.







It will also take into account the underlying inflation

figures that came out. And we've seen the commercial  banks basically split right down the middle as to  whether they're going to hold interest rates or increase  interest rates, with one bank saying that they're - not  necessarily today - but they will cut interest rates. So  that's the kind of commercial analysis which comes to  this conclusion: they don't know.

GILBERT: The Opposition Treasury Spokesman Joe Hockey says

the Government should wear some of the blame if  rates do go up today because the Government has  wasted money, he says. It's done everything it can to  possibly … everything it possibly can to waste money.  He says that puts upward pressure on inflation, on  interest rates.

EMERSON: Well Joe Hockey would say that.  But you see they've

been - depending on who you talk about …  talk to in  the Coalition - some have actually opposed any fiscal  stimulus at all.

One of the economic influences coming in to play now

is that the fiscal stimulus is actually being withdrawn …  is actually being withdrawn. Now that itself has a  slightly contractionary effect as we move to bring the  Budget to surplus in 2012-13. The fiscal stimulus was  essential, absolutely essential in keeping Australia out  of recession. We're one of the very few major  advanced countries to avoid recession.

GILBERT: But could it have been more disciplined the way that

that money was spent? We saw a lot of wastage on the  the batts ceiling insulation …

EMERSON: Well, we do know that the ceiling insulation program

was … was not a success at all. The Prime Minister







described it as a “mess”. But in terms of the overall  fiscal position in the settings, you had two basic  prescriptions. Depending on who you talk to in the  Coalition, some saying no stimulus was needed and  we should have stayed in surplus which would have  absolutely guaranteed  large levels of unemployment in  this country.

Because if we were to stay in surplus when the global

economy was contracting - and therefore putting us  into a natural deficit - we would have had to contract  even further. That's the wacko economics of Tony  Abbott and his team: that there actually shouldn't have  been any deficit at all. There was a deficit. It was  necessary to keep us out of recession; 11 million jobs  lost in Europe and North America. At the same time,  412,000 jobs gained in Australia.

GILBERT: Well, you sparring partner Senator Brandis is stuck in

Sydney traffic I'm told. It's not an issue for us in  Canberra…

EMERSON: No.

GILBERT: … but we'll chat to Senator Brandis when he joins us,

hopefully in the next few minutes. I want to ask you  about the health plan.

The Prime Minister is going to announce this

apparently this morning at 9.30am. She's visiting the  Canberra Hospital this morning. This … the  Government will be hoping this gives you a bit of  momentum. You know, the controversial carbon tax,  the controversial Malaysia deal. Both … very much …  large section of the electorate opposes both of those  measures. But this deal, you would think, would have a







majority support and should give you some  momentum.

EMERSON: It does. It does have majority support. It doesn't have

support of the Coalition. Before it was actually  announced, Tony Abbott condemned it. So again what  he knows is one word: no, no, no, no, and no.

GILBERT: Do you hope this will help turn around the momentum

politically?

EMERSON: Well obviously it's good news. But it is also a career-

limiting move on the part of Ministers to pre-empt a  Prime Ministerial announcement, so I won't do that. But  let's just reflect on this for a moment, Kieran. The  Prime Minister said this year would be a year of  decision. Well it's almost been the month of decision.

We've had the carbon-pricing details released, and so

people can have a proper informed debate about that.  The Malaysian deal has been settled. We resumed live  cattle exports and put them on a sustainable footing  within a month, which in the circumstances is a lot  shorter than it otherwise could have been. We  announced the Tasmanian forest deal which ends 30  years of conflicts in the Tasmania forest.

And now as we hope and expect the Prime Minister

announces a health deal. Well, that also is one of  those matters on which she said she would deliver. So,  five issues delivered within the space of one month. I  think you put all of those together you get this  cumulative momentum of the Prime Minister doing  exactly what she said she was going to do.







GILBERT: All right, let's take a quite break. Hopefully, after the

break we'll be joined by Senator George Brandis, the  Deputy Opposition Leader in the Senate. Stay with us  on AM Agenda.

[Commercial break]

GILBERT: Welcome back to AM Agenda. With me this morning,

the Acting Foreign Minister and the Trade Minister  Craig Emerson. And from the Sky News Centre I have  the shadow Attorney-General and the Deputy  Opposition Leader in the Senate, Senator George  Brandis.

Senator Brandis, I want to ask you about a couple of

things I've been talking to Craig Emerson about. First,  on interest rates. The Government, obviously Ministers  aren't able to suggest one way or the other, but the  Opposition's been pretty clear that the RBA should  keep rates on hold today.

GEORGE BRANDIS: Well we think so. And you know, the story of interest  rates over the last couple of years in this country has  been a story of the Government putting upward  pressure on interest rates through unnecessary debt.  Obviously, as a result of the GFC, interest rates fell  across the board and around the world.

But interest rates in Australia today are higher than

they would otherwise have been because this  Government just spends and wastes so much money,  puts the Commonwealth Government in particular into  so much debt. And, as a result, the Government has to  go into the market, has to borrow, raise money through  the bond market in particular. So, interest rates today,  we say, although they are relatively low post-GFC, are







higher than they need to be and that's entirely due to  the policies of this Government.

GILBERT: Senator Brandis, given the uncertainty around the

world, do you think the RBA … is your expectation …  the markets are pretty much split on this as to what's  going to happen today. But what's your sense?

BRANDIS: Well look, Kieran, you'll forgive me if I say I'm not an

economic commentator. I noticed that the chief  economist at Westpac Mr Evans is saying something  different from the chief economist of the ANZ Bank, so  if … if senior professional economic forecasters can't  agree you wouldn't expect a humble lawyer like me to  be able to offer a prediction.

GILBERT: Yes, okay then. Let's move on. I want to ask you about

the health plan the Prime Minister has secured with the  states after months of wrangling with Victoria and  Western Australia.

They've got huge … they've got them on board, going

to make this announcement at 9.30 here at Parliament  House. The Prime Minister said this would be a year of  decision and delivery and she's, you know, regardless  of what you think of her policy agenda, regardless of a  hung parliament, she's been able to deliver that with  this big reform today.

BRANDIS: Oh has she? I mean I don't think this is decision and

delivery; I think this is back down and falling flat on  your face. Don't forget that when Mr Rudd first  announced…

EMERSON: [Laughs] George…







BRANDIS: … this four years ago. Four years ago there was going

to be a massive reform of the health system, as a  result of which the Commonwealth was going to take  over responsibility. And the states have basically  negotiated, first Mr Rudd and now Julia Gillard and the  Health Minister Nicola Roxon, down to a situation in  which almost none of the original guarantees or  objectives that the Commonwealth sought to deliver  with this health plan have been delivered.

The states are laughing all the way to the bank.

They're getting an enormous amount of money, but  none of what was promised - whether it was the four-hour guarantee, whether it was the elective surgery  guarantee, whether it was the independent authority  that was going to oversight the delivery of health  services. The Commonwealth has capitulated on all of  these matters, so that what's being announced today.  No doubt at all it will be … it will be promoted with a lot  of flowery rhetoric and heroic language. But it doesn't  remotely resemble what either Mr Rudd or Julia Gillard  promised.

GILBERT: But Senator Brandis, there is apparently going to be a

four-hour target but it's been reduced from 95 per cent  to 90 per cent in emergency cases. Also the National  Health Performance Authority is going to provide  quarterly updates on the performance of hospitals so  there is that oversight.

Plus the, you know, the pool funding which will provide

greater transparency. There are some - while it might  not be as tough as the original reform - there are some,  you would suggest, positive reforms in this, are there  not?

BRANDIS: Well Kieran, let me just make two points about that.







First of all, because I said a moment ago if you look at

the objectives the Government set for itself, in what  was meant to be according to Mr Rudd a once-in-a-generation piece of health reform, virtually none of  those objectives have been achieved. They've been  walked away from. They've been watered down.

Secondly in re… if you lo... if you look at the structure

of the … the monitoring body, that was meant to be a  monitoring body that was going to be run by the  Commonwealth. Now, effectively, all the power in that  body is in the states.

And finally, Kieran, let me just quickly make this point.

After the series of policy failures and failure to deliver  across the whole range of public policy, does anybody  seriously believe that the Gillard Government is going  to be able to meet its objectives in the health sphere  where it hasn't been able to meet its objectives in  relation to immigration, unlawful asylum-seekers,  education, government debt? You look across the  whole range of public policies and this is a Government  …

GILBERT: Well let's…

BRANDIS: …that just doesn't deliver.

GILBERT: Let's look at asylum-seekers now, Craig Emerson. I

think we've levelled up the time on those two issues.

EMERSON: Equal time you reckon?

GILBERT: Equal time. I hope so. We'll … I'll be told by our

viewers, anyway, via email if I haven't.







EMERSON: And I won't get any more emails saying I interrupted

George.

GILBERT: No, that's right.

EMERSON: Don't talk over that nice Senator George Brandis.

GILBERT: So you did well there. Good on you.

Asylum seekers. Apparently the Immigration

Department are going to use videos on YouTube to  film every step of this first group to be, you know,  treated and dealt with under the Malaysia deal. The  Government's obviously desperate to get this message  out to prospective asylum seekers. That's the key, isn't  it, to get that message out?

EMERSON: Determined, determined to break the people

smugglersÃ¢ÂÂ model and let the people smugglers be  under no doubt as to the Government's resolve to  break that model; and to ensure that people do not pay  people smugglers to take a risky journey to come from  Indonesia to Australia only to go back to Malaysia,  from whence they came in the first place.

GILBERT: We've put this … we've got the front page of The Daily

Telegraph. We can put it up on the screen for you. It's  quite an ominous picture: the Riot Squad. Is that really  the sort of message you should be sending to people?  Many of them will be … would have suffered  persecution, you would imagine. Many of them will be  genuine refugees and then we have a riot squad to  welcome them.

EMERSON: Well, this is not a voluntary arrangement. We're not

saying to people, Ã¢ÂÂwould you prefer to stay in Australia







or to go Malaysia?Ã¢ÂÂ. We're saying, Ã¢ÂÂyou come by boat  from the date of the signature on the agreement, then  you will be going to MalaysiaÃ¢ÂÂ. That's what we're  saying. That's what the message is that we're seeking  to impart. And if that's a tough message, it's actually  designed to save lives, Kieran.

And for those people who say this is too tough, they

should reflect on the fact that people lose their lives  making this journey, have done for a very long time,  including most recently towards the end of last year.

GILBERT: Okay. Senator Brandis, I'll get your thoughts on that in

a moment. I just want to point out to our viewers that  the vote is underway in the US Congress on the debt  ceiling bill. If you want to watch all of it unfold, on  Channel 648 A-PAC, you can do that. We're going to  bring the result to you as soon as it happens, though.  We'll have that for you as soon as it happens here on  Sky News. But if you want to watch every minute of  that, you can do that on Channel 648.

Senator Brandis, on the issue of asylum seekers: the

Riot Squad on the front page of the Telegraph. It's a  picture in The Australian newspaper as well. The  Coalition used … well, I know from memory the  Coalition used the SAS once against asylum seekers  on the Tampa.

BRANDIS: Well look, Kieran, when I see these images, I'm

reminded of sitting in the Senate in August 2008 and  hearing the then-Immigration Minister, Senator Evans,  say how proud he was that the Labor Government was  going to abandon the inhumane policies of the Howard  Government. That was where the source of the  problem. The Government didn't in 2008 have the  policy courage to maintain the tough and successful







policies of the Howard Government, so it changed  those policies by weakening them. Senator Evans said  he was very proud to have done so.

And, as a result, for the last three years we've seen

this problem escalate completely out of control. So that  now, in order in a sense to play catch-up, the  Government is revert … resorting to these

extraordinary measures that it wouldn't have had to  resort to in the first place if it had had the policy  courage to maintain the Pacific Solution which had  worked so well for the Howard Government that there  were a negligible number of boat arrivals after it was  introduced in 2001.

After the Labor Party weakened the policies in 2008,

there have been about 150 boats come to Australia in  the last three years. And today, even as we speak,  there are some 6,000 asylum seekers in detention in  Australia. When the Howard Government went out of  office there were a handful.

Now, can I tell you, Kieran, the reason the Opposition

doesn't believe that all this chest-beating and pseudo  toughness that the Government has lately adopted is  going to work is because the people smugglers have  got their measure. They've got their measure because  they know that they've already abandoned tough  policies once, and they also know - because the  people smugglers follow developments in Australian  politics very closely - they know that this Government  is in hock to a political party, namely the Australian  Greens, who want to weaken our border protection  policies further.

We'll see if it works. My very strong view is …







EMERSON: Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah…

BRANDIS: … that it is unlikely to.

GILBERT: We're almost out of time. Quickly.

EMERSON: Yes, sure, George, the Greens are absolutely over the

moon about this policy. But what you've heard from  George since he came in is complete negativity. There  is not one positive word that he could bring himself.  Why? Because he's straight out of Tony Abbott's stable  - no, no, no, no and no.

GILBERT: Craig Emerson and Senator Brandis, appreciate your

time today, gentlemen. Have a good day.
