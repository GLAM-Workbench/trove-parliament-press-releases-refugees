'Undoing the Damage and Restoring Multiculturalism' Dr James Jupp, Australian National University

Race and ethnic relations have been damaged in recent years by several developments:

The election in 1996 of a government many of whose leaders, including the prime minister, had consistently criticised multiculturalism and Indigenous rights for many years. Ã¢ÂÂÃ¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»

The creation of One Nation and its securing of one million votes in the 1998 federal election. Ã¢ÂÂÃ¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â» The dismantling by the federal government of several institutions, including the Office of Multicultural Affairs and the Bureau of Immigration, Multicultural and Population Research. Ã¢ÂÂÃ¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»

An increase in tension related to terrorism and Islamic fundamentalism, especially since the attack on New York in September 2001. Ã¢ÂÂÃ¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»

The extension and privatisation of the mandatory detention of undocumented asylum seekers. Ã¢ÂÂÃ¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â» New policies towards asylum seekers, culminating in the Tampa episode and the 'Pacific solution'. Ã¢ÂÂÃ¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â» Continuous attacks by conservative politicians, journalists, broadcasters and think-tanks on 'politically correct' policies relating to multiculturalism, refugees and Indigenous affairs. Ã¢ÂÂÃ¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»

The creation of a public opinion hostile to many previous liberalisations, using 'coded racism' and, if necessary, lies and distortions. Ã¢ÂÂÃ¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»

The effects of social problems and alienation among some ethnic groups. Ã¢ÂÂÃ¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â» The failure of the ALP Opposition to campaign against these developments. Ã¢ÂÂÃ¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»

I will confine my analysis to ethnic and immigrant issues, which is my area of expertise. There is very little plausible measurement of racial or ethnic hostility and public figures regularly proclaim that Australia is not only the 'most multicultural country on earth' but also 'the most tolerant'. These are flattering to the electorate and cannot be taken at face value. Most discussion of ethnic relations in the past has concentrated on the absence of race riots and violence as found in other societies, especially the UK and the USA. By that measure Australia is tolerant - but it also lacks both a fascist tradition (common in Europe) and a history of race rioting (the last serious one being in 1934 and the most frequently mentioned being 150 years ago).

The rise of One Nation alerted Australians to the dormant inheritance of White Australia and its continuing appeal in provincial areas, among ageing Anglo-Australian men and in some declining or depressed urban districts. No party in recent years has risen so sharply in such a short time. The arguments it used - especially against Asians and Aborigines - were time honoured and recalled those used fifty or one hundred years before. Nostalgia for an

Australia which was rapidly passing away was also nostalgia for the days 'when we were all the same'. This nostalgia is shared by John Howard, who regularly states in public that 'Australians are all pretty much alike' -which was never true and is now manifestly absurd.

Neither One Nation nor the mainstream conservative parties have ever called for a return to White Australia or used the racist terminology so fashionable at Federation in 1901 and shared at that time with the labour movement. However, One Nation came mainly out of the mainstream conservative parties and current polling evidence suggests that most of its supporters have returned there. The clue to the events of late 2001 is simply that one million voters cannot be ignored and that the major parties will pander to any large constituency which so effectively mobilises its support and gains media attention. That One Nation is now almost defunct is a major step backwards towards a more civilised public debate. But the sentiments and resentments are still there and politicians will still be tempted to cater for them.

The Conservative Onslaught

Conservative hostility to multiculturalism predates the rise of One Nation and may well continue. John Howard publicly broke the consensus on immigration and multicultural policy in 1988. This consensus had effectively lasted since 1975 and included the presumption that there would be no return to White Australia. Even in 1988 Howard removed then Senator John Stone from his 'shadow' position for arguing that the end of consensus would be based on a drastic reduction in Asian immigration. The debates around national identity, which took place mainly in Quadrant during the bicentennial year, held that there was an identifiable Australian culture which was threatened and denigrated by supporters of multiculturalism. Many of these arguments came from the 'culture wars' of the United States and paid little attention to the modest reality of Australian multiculturalism. In practice the formulation of official policy from the first agenda of 1989 to the most recent one of 1999, has always stressed the centrality of commitment to Australia, its institutions, its basic traditions and the English language.

The conservative attack on multiculturalism gathered momentum with repeated criticism by Geoffrey Blainey (' a nation of warring tribes'), David Barnett ('the bloated multicultural industry'), Stephen Rimmer ('fiscal anarchy'), Katherine Betts ('the new class ideology') and Paul Sheehan ('the dividing of Australia'). Some of these were close to Howard and were duly rewarded after 1996. Talkback radio was normally hostile as well and Alan Jones gave wide prominence to Pauline Hanson on top of his regular slot reserved for Howard. The loss of Liberal leadership by Howard between 1989 and 1995 made little difference and both Andrew Peacock and John Hewson attacked multiculturalism.

Thus during the years of Labor government from 1983 to 1996 multiculturalism was official policy of the Commonwealth and all the States, while being regularly denounced by some conservative politicians and commentators. This built up a head of steam which erupted in 1996 with the election of the Howard Coalition and of Pauline Hanson. Her view was simply that multiculturalism should be 'abolished' - a position which she held until she relinquished One Nation leadership in 2002. The immediate political effect was the abolition of most national agencies for multiculturalism and the threat, and in one case the reality, of withdrawal of funding for others. Terms such as 'multiculturalism' and 'social justice' were excised from the public agendas at least until 1998, as was the expression 'non-English speaking background' (replaced by 'culturally or linguistically distinct' which did not catch on).

It could be argued that winding up a few agencies and programs at the national level did not make much difference to the reality of Australian race relations. Indigenous affairs were less directly affected although funding was seriously reduced. Previous Liberal Party threats to abolish both HREOC and ATSIC were never implemented. At the State level Liberals such as Jeff Kennett and Nick Greiner simply ignored the national approach. However the word had gone out that multiculturalism was off the agenda and this affected the behaviour of public servants and the resulting budgetary and administrative allocations. Management tools such as 'access and equity' were reduced in importance. Advocacy of ethnic diversity was replaced by small 'living in harmony' campaigns and many publicly funded agencies were instructed not to practice advocacy at all.

Restoring the Balance

The political shifts at the Commonwealth level would not have been so important in affecting ethnic relationships had it not been for several other parallel developments. These included the electoral rise of 'green' organisations and the popularity of 'ecological' critiques of immigration (for example by Tim Flannery); the steady rise in the 'non-European' population and its visibility in parts of the major cities; the growth of social problems, including unemployment and crime, among some ethnic communities, especially those of 'humanitarian' origins; the high profile of Indigenous issues; the continuing impact of media images of the Middle East; the continuing campaign by sections of the mass media against ethnic and racial diversity; the strong electoral showing of One Nation; and, finally, the series of crises around mandatory detention, asylum seekers and terrorism which preceded the general election of 2001.

Many of these impacts, and especially those with overseas origins, would have affected the local scene

regardless of public policy. Refugee impact and terrorism have seriously advanced the influence of conservative and reactionary parties in some European countries, most of them more extreme than One Nation (and more efficient!). Hopefully an Australian government consistently committed to racial equality, multiculturalism and social justice, should have blunted the impact of these influences more effectively than has been done - but this is an optimistic view. In fact, neither in the Gulf War under Labor nor the terrorist crisis under the Coalition, has there been anything like the inter-ethnic hostility that many feared (including the 'warring tribes' pessimists).

Even if the sky did not fall during 2001-2002, Australia behaved in an authoritarian manner which damaged its international reputation and revealed unhealthy xenophobia at home. The demise of One Nation and revelation of the unjustified demonisation of asylum seekers, has brought the situation back to normal. But that 'normal' situation still includes having more than 3 000 people locked away in the Australian desert or on Pacific islands; the abolition of effective national advocacy, monitoring and research to improve and maintain ethnic relations; an immigration policy which makes family reunion very difficult; a volatile public opinion which is potentially susceptible to racist or xenophobic attitudes; and a national political leadership which has exploited all of this.

To improve community relations requires changed attitudes at the national level; the recreation of viable institutions, preferably outside the province of the Immigration Department; the constant official repetition that Australia is and will remain multicultural and that this is of benefit; curriculum and media content which also repeats and develops this theme; the continued work of State level agencies and relevant local governments; and shifts away from the temptation to 'play the race card' in party politics.

All of this was attempted in the years between 1972 and 1996 and has had a long-term impact. It has to be resumed, though not necessarily in precisely the same form. Australia is not likely to go up in flames because of racial tensions. But human rights are individual rights. Among these is the ability to enjoy the benefits of Australian life with equity and free of prejudice.
