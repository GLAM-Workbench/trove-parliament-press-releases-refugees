TURNBULL JOINT PRESS CONFERENCE WITH MACFARLANE - COALITION  PLAN TO SAVE JOBS AND REDUCE COSTS

The Hon Malcolm Turnbull MP

Leader of the Opposition



The Hon Ian Macfarlane MP

Shadow Minister for Energy and Resources

Acting Shadow Minister Assisting the Leader on Emissions Trading Design

E&OE

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Tonight we are putting the ball back into Kevin Rudd’s court. The Coalition party room has agreed to sensible

amendments, practical amendments which will save thousands, thousands of Australian jobs and which will

ensure that business, particularly small business, is not unnecessarily slugged with massive price hikes in

electricity and of course everything else that uses electricity, including groceries.

So the fact of the matter is, now is the time for the Rudd Government to get real about its emissions trading

scheme. They have a scheme that is almost friendless, that has been criticised by every other political party and

pretty much every other interest group and every industry.

Now we’ve done the hard yards, Ian in particular with Andrew Robb have done the hard yards in talking to many

Australian industries and businesses right across the country, finding out what they see as the real flaws in this

scheme. And so we’ve set out a number of practical measures that will protect jobs in manufacturing, in mining,

that will lessen the price hikes in electricity, that will protect farmers and will unlock the opportunity to achieve

substantial reductions in greenhouse gas emissions through agricultural offsets which are a central feature of the

emissions trading schemes being proposed in the United States, but for some reason or other are neglected here

in Australia.

IAN MACFARLANE:

The detail of the scheme is laid out. It covers the key areas of agriculture, food processing, electricity generation,

electricity cost to consumers and also the treatment of energy intensive trade exposed industries. As Malcolm

said, we will stay on the target of five per cent reduction and if the Government accepts our amendments as they

currently stand it will be done within budget of the scheme.

QUESTION:

Mr Turnbull, every negotiation has an end but what in this is negotiable or is it a take it or leave it offer to the

Government?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Well Ian is going to be heading up the negotiations so we’ve set out our amendments. They have set them out in

some detail and we have a great deal more detail obviously to provide to the Government and ultimately to move

in the Parliament. So really the onus now is on the Government. Are they genuinely prepared to engage in good

faith negotiations?

QUESTION:

Mr Turnbull, can you explain how you can fund these amendments within the revenue of the scheme if you’re

drastically increasing the compensation for generators, increasing EITE assistance etc, etc, how that works and

whether you mean that it will be self-funded every year or sort of broadly over time?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Do you want to address that Ian?

IAN MACFARLANE:

Yes, sure. Starting with generators - there will be no added compensation in the first five years of the scheme.

We need to be aware there is a clear surplus of credits after 2015 running forward to 2025 estimated at around

$50 billion in unallocated credits.

Secondly that in terms of the emission intensity cap and trade scheme we’re proposing to flatten out the price rise

in electricity prices, that will free up money out of the amount of money required for compensation to households.

But I need to be emphatic that households will be no worse off under these amendments than they would have

been in net terms under the current government amendments. There are significant areas there where these

emissions can be also offset through offset schemes and ensure that we reach the target.

If the Government rejects any component of this then obviously we will have to look at an accrual basis where if

you look over the life of the scheme, or certainly over the life of the scheme to 2025, the scheme will absolutely

still be self-funding. You may run at a loss in a couple of the first five years but you will be back in surplus from

there on. And with $50 billion to play with, the losses that we are talking about will be easily ameliorated.

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Can I just add something to Ian’s point there. You’ve also got to take into account that the reason we’re moving,

or proposing these changes, is because we want to protect thousands of Australian jobs and vital Australian

industries.

Now if those industries are lost and those jobs are lost of course that also has a big impact on the Government’s

revenues. So you have to look at the revenue situation of the Government overall. You can’t just look at the

scheme itself as though it was independent of every other head of government revenue. And there are very big,

what economists would call, dynamic revenue issues associated with this.

I mean the problem, the fundamental problem with the Government’s scheme is that it will destroy thousands of

Australian jobs and you don’t have to take our word for that. You know there is widespread consensus on this. It

is a poorly designed and flawed scheme.

I know what the Government wants to do and they have been pretty clear about it. They want to have high

electricity prices and high emissions trading permit revenues so that they can then redistribute the money to the

beneficiaries of their choice. Right? Now what we want to see is a scheme that does not destroy Australian jobs,

does not destroy thousands of Australian jobs in vital industries and that as far as practicable keeps electricity

prices low, particularly during the period of transition from what is unquestionably an emissions intensive

economy to a less emissions intensive economy.

QUESTION:

Mr Turnbull, even though you’ve been given the all clear by this meeting today to go away and negotiate, many

or some National senators for example made clear they don’t care what you negotiate, they’re still not going to

vote for this at the end of the day. Have you resigned yourself to not being able to turn those people or do you

think that you will be able to come up with an outcome that will swing them your way?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

All we have committed ourselves to do is what we said at the outset. Ian and I have been completely consistent

about this. We have set out a series of amendments. We have sought the support of the party room to

negotiating in good faith with the Government on the basis of those amendments, and when we get to an

outcome, when those negotiations reach an outcome, as they undoubtedly will, we will consider them, Shadow

Cabinet will consider them and the party room will consider them.

QUESTION:

Sure but can you answer the question?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Well what is the question?

QUESTION:

The question was, have you resigned yourself to not being able to provide the leadership to turn around the

Nationals or others or do you think that in your negotiations…

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

But this presupposes that we would be disagreeing with the Nationals. You see, Matt, with great respect, you’re

missing the point. The whole point here is good faith negotiations which will have an outcome which we will then

consider what our response is and indeed the Government is in exactly the same position.

QUESTION:

Mr Turnbull, to put the question a different way, if you get all of your amendments passed by the Government are

you confident that you will get at least a majority of your party room to support passage of the ETS before

Copenhagen?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Look we’re not going to speculate on the outcome of the negotiations here tonight…

QUESTION:

[inaudible]

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Well, look, if we get all of our amendments then we would be delighted and we will certainly be recommending

support for it; Ian and I would be recommending support for it and I would be confident we would secure that

support but the fact that…

QUESTION:

[inaudible]

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Let’s just have a question and answer. You have asked me that question. Of course, that is the basis of good

faith negotiations, but we will come back to the party room when we have got an outcome from our negotiations.

QUESTION:

How is the environment better off under your amendments? You have continually criticised the Government for

not making deep enough cuts so where are you making more cuts in emissions?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Well I don’t think we have criticised the Government for making deep enough cuts.

IAN MACFARLANE:

We have said we will reach the same…

QUESTION:

Andrew Robb has said on many occasions that…

IAN MACFARLANE:

Sorry, with all respect to Andrew who has done an enormous amount of work on this and came forward to this

room with the work from Frontier, this is not the plan that was presented to you two months ago. This is a

different plan. It has a completely different make up across the energy sector. It has some commonality with what

was discussed last time, but in terms of the target we are saying the target is five per cent. That is the

Government target.

We are on for that target and the way we will do it is firstly, even though for instance we’ve exempted fugitive

emissions from the scheme, they will be dealt with through regulation and I will guarantee you that in terms of the

actual emission reductions that Kevin Rudd could produce from his scheme and the actual emission reductions

that we could produce from our scheme in the coal industry, they are exactly the same because our carbon

reductions are the ones that you can achieve with technology. So there is no walking away from emission

reduction in that area and what we are doing is adding to the scheme a number of areas, particularly things like

soil carbon, which Kevin Rudd has completely ignored. When our trade competitors like Europe and like America

adopt carbon abatement through soil carbon and agriculture, we will be at a disadvantage if we don’t do that and

if it is an internationally recognised process of carbon abatement then it will be included in our scheme and it will

ensure we reach the target.

QUESTION:

So what percentage of the targets will be made up of agricultural offsets?

IAN MACFARLANE:

Well we have got to sit down and do the sums on that but I am saying, why don’t you go and ask Kevin Rudd

what part of the abatement is going to come from the electricity industry? Why don’t you ask him what part of the

abatement is going to come from the coal industry? Because he cannot perform miracles.

This concept that he has got that zero emission coal is going to suddenly wipe emissions out of the stationary

electricity-generating industry is a complete myth. There is no likelihood. Treasury’s own modelling says the first

commercial scales of multiple zero emission power stations won’t be built under the late `20s. That is Treasury’s

words and the first commercial - as in without any government subsidies - won’t be built until the late `30s. So

you are talking about something that is not even going to happen in the next 20 years. And so Kevin Rudd’s

carbon abatement is no different to ours. We will be using the same technology under our scheme as he will be

under his.

QUESTION:

Mr Turnbull, you’re now on a good faith negotiation path. Will you, as part of that good faith, in the Senate

support extended sittings if they’re needed to get this through?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Well what we will do is first conclude our negotiations with the Government.

Now, as we have said right - Ian and I have said this consistently - if the question is how will we respond to the

bill when it comes up for a vote in the Senate, whenever that may be, we will respond in the light of the extent to

which the Government accepts our amendments and in the light of the political developments and circumstances

at the time both here and internationally. There is quite a lot going on internationally. Now we talked about…

QUESTION:

That wasn’t the question. …if the question was. The question was specifically will you vote in the Senate for an

extension of time if you feel you need it to get it through? [inaudible]

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

We will consider that at the time. There is no reason why other than in order to achieve an agreed outcome. I

mean, clearly, one thing that we could do, notwithstanding our very strong view that it is more prudent to finalise

the design of the scheme after Copenhagen rather than before it, one thing we can do is we can enable the

Government to finalise the legislation before Copenhagen. But that is something, that is a matter that we have to

consider very, very carefully and that is one of the chips, if you like, in the negotiating. It is one of the issues in

the negotiations. If this bill were to be debated and there were to be no negotiations, if it were just simply to be

debated with amendments coming up in the normal way, the normal debate of this in the Senate would run well

into the new year.

QUESTION:

Mr Turnbull, is it the case, just to clarify, is it the case that even if the Government were to accept holis-bolis this

package of amendments, you would still have to bring them back for a party room vote. And if that is the case,

why should the Government negotiate with you when you can’t even promise to deliver it?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Ian said it is a bizarre question and I wouldn’t say it is bizarre but we have always said that is the case so that is

a…

QUESTION:

But you can’t even promise that you will deliver the amendments that you are putting up tonight. I mean we have

got Liberal MPs saying to us, ‘oh I think we should take them out and test them but I will never vote for a

carbon…

IAN MACFARLANE:

I have got the list of who said that and I tell you it is a small minority of this party room. I can tell you. I know

exactly who said what and the thing that surprised me…

QUESTION:

Well they say it’s not a small minority.

IAN MACFARLANE:

Well I have got the numbers and they are in my little black book.

QUESTION:

[inaudible]

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Hang on, we have just got to be very practical and businesslike about this. We have a set of amendments which

the party room has endorsed which we are taking to the Government. We will have discussions with the

Government and no doubt we will reach some conclusion or other. We will then consider the best we can

negotiate with the Government and they will no doubt consider it as well.

QUESTION:

[inaudible] talk about them, not to pass legislation if they were accepted.

IAN MACFARLANE:

That’s all we asked for.

QUESTION:

Because that’s all you could get?

IAN MACFARLANE:

No, that’s all we asked for, that’s all we were ever going to ask for at this meeting.

QUESTION:

How would you characterise the debate in the party room then and are the amendments that came out of the

party room identical to the ones you took into it?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Well the debate was robust and courteous. It was a very good debate. It was a lengthy debate but it was a very

good debate and it included many, many… a large percentage of the members and senators present spoke, and

the amendments that were approved were exactly the ones we brought in.

QUESTION:

Did any members express dissatisfaction with the way the leadership came to the position?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Not that I recall. No. I don’t recall. I recall there being some very kind things but there wasn’t a lot of criticism, no.

But anyway.

QUESTION:

[inaudible]

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

George Brandis does the party room briefing.

QUESTION:

Did anyone reserve their right to not vote for [inaudible]?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Look can I just say this to you: every Member of the party room, every Member and Senator reserves their right,

as indeed does every member of the Shadow Cabinet, as to how they will respond to whatever emerges from the

negotiations.

I mean you know at the end of the day Ian will go into negotiations with the Government, he’ll do that in good faith

and he’ll see what emerges and what emerges will then be considered - and I might say, Penny Wong is in no

different a position because whatever she emerges from her discussions with Ian, she then has to take back to

her cabinet and her party room.

So neither Ian nor Penny have got some sort of plenipotentiary powers to sign-off on behalf of the Government in

Penny Wong’s case or the Opposition in the case of Ian.

QUESTION:

Do you think that Senator Wong is serious about negotiating? You said I think earlier today that she’s always

putting up tests and… play politics from the start….

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

No of course they play politics with it and here are some practical suggestions. I mean take the issue with coal

mining as a pretty straight forward example. Coal mining is our biggest export industry. It employs thousands of

Australians, generates billions of dollars of value to the Australian economy and hundreds of millions of dollars if

not billions of dollars in tax, probably billions of dollars in tax in one form or another. So it is a gigantic industry -

and yet the Rudd Government is proposing to impose a carbon tax on coal which has no counterpart, not just in

the economies with which they compete, the developing economies like Indonesia, Columbia, South Africa, but

no counterpart in the United States or Europe either.

So it is literally Kevin Rudd has decided to make Australia, the largest coal exporter in the world, the most heavily

taxed coal mining business in the world as far as carbon goes. Now that is a remarkable, bizarre position that

they take. And so what we have come back and said in a nutshell is: treat coal mining the same as it’s going to

be treated in the United States and Europe. I mean when you boil it all down that’s what we are saying. Now

that’s common sense.

Now you know Penny Wong and Kevin Rudd have got to get real. Are they going to try to penalise, make

themselves some kind of environmental heroes out of slugging our biggest export industry in a way that will do

absolutely nothing for global emissions, because obviously you know if you mine less coal in Australia, more coal

would be mined in Indonesia and Columbia - a sort of outcome for the environment probably negative overall,

but a huge negative economic impact on Australia. And there’s a host of other changes here that are similarly

practical, common sense amendments.

QUESTION:

Mr Macfarlane how many names are in your little black book?

IAN MACFARLANE:

I’m not talking about that. I just wanted people to understand that people who say that there’s no way in hell the

party room will vote for the amendments when they come back from Penny Wong are simply wrong.

They should have been in the party room. They should have heard the tone. Everyone in this party room wants

us to bring the outcome of the negotiation back. There is a very small minority, and I could give you the number,

and it is less than 10, who say ‘we don’t care what you bring back, we’re going to vote it down’.

Well last time I counted there was more than 20 people in the party room.

QUESTION:

We would be happy to come next time….

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

So the bottom line is good faith negotiations, approaching it an open mind and whatever emerges from the

negotiations, both the Shadow Cabinet and the party room will consider with an open mind and in good faith. And

as to how we end up voting on it will depend on what the outcome of those negotiations are.

QUESTION:

Mr Turnbull do you support the way Sharman Stone is prosecuting the asylum seeker issue for the Coalition?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Sharman Stone is doing a great job as Shadow Immigration Minister.

QUESTION:

Can you explain again the accrual accounting model [inaudible] taking money from future revenue to compensate

for [inaudible] today, is that right?

IAN MACFARLANE:

Well the way the scheme stands at the moment it will fund itself year-on-year. If they, the Government, reject

components out of the scheme, which means that the cost of operating the scheme in terms of dollar

compensation goes up and there isn’t commensurate savings somewhere else, then we will have to accrue

account and we’re just saying that over the next 10 years, let alone the next 15, the scheme will be grossly in

profit, that there will be literally tens of billions of dollars.

But what I’m saying is that you may find that if they change let’s say the electricity model, that the scheme will run

at a deficit, not a big deficit, maybe one maybe two billion - compared to what’s just been spent on the stimulus,

chicken feed, not that I ever thought billions was chicken feed - but it’s going to be small amounts relative to the

amount of money that will flow into the scheme which is currently unassigned as of year 2016.

QUESTION:

…reject components of your amendments, just to be clear, you’re saying that your amendments….

IAN MACFARLANE:

…under its current format….

QUESTION:

…will be self funded?

IAN MACFARLANE:

Under its current format.

QUESTION:

…that less than 10 doesn’t include the Nationals does it? There’s like 14….

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Oh look, Phil, yeah okay….

IAN MACFARLANE:

I’m not annunciating that any further Phil. I made the comment. I stand by it.

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Look the bottom line is, as I said, we have got some practical, common sense amendments here which are

workable and will save thousands of Australian jobs. That’s the key point.

The issue now, the test for Penny Wong and Kevin Rudd is are they prepared to negotiate in good faith? If they

want our support then they are going to have to give some ground, quite a lot of ground in fact.

But we will see how we get on in our negotiations. The negotiations will come to conclusion and then we will

decide - we, both the Opposition and the Government - will decide how we respond. Thank you very much.
