NATIONAL CRISIS DEMANDS PARLIAMENT RECALL: 
HARRADINE

Â

Tasmanian Independent Senator Brian Harradine today wrote to the Prime 
Minister, Deputy Prime Minister, Leader of the Opposition, Leader of 
the Australian Democrats and mino r parties urging the recall 
of Federal Parliament.

Â

“Australia faces a national crisis. In my assessment 
the crisis is of such gravity as to require the recall of the National 
Parliament,” Senator Harradine said.

Â

“The crisis is caused by the massacre of innocent 
East Timorese on our doorstep. The brutality and violence is perpetrated 
by so-called militia under the protection and direction of elements 
of Indonesian armed and security forces.

Â

“Besides the immediate humanitarian and refugee 
crisis, Australia faces a long-term crisis in our relations with our 
neighbour, Indonesia. The close friendly relationships built up over 
many years are now threatened by the apparent inability of the Indonesian 
civil power to control elements of the armed forces. This spells international 
chaos and external danger.

Â

“Australia also faces a crisis in our relations 
with the US and the UN, both of whom accepted Indonesia’s word that 
the whole process of East Timor’s expression of self-determination 
would proceed in an orderly and peaceful manner.

Â

The East Timorese people have been deceived and betrayed.”

Â

Senator Harradine said that the purpose of the Parliamentary 
recall would be to focus on the crisis and adopt united resolutions 
of support for measures to address it.

Â

A press conference will take place in Senator Harradine’s 
Hobart office today at 2.30pm
