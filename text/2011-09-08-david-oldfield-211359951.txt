LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION  THE HON. TONY ABBOTT MHR  FEDERAL MEMBER FOR WARRINGAH

8 September 2011

TRANSCRIPT OF THE HON. TONY ABBOTT MHR  INTERVIEW WITH DAVID OLDFIELD,  RADIO 2UE, SYDNEY

Subjects: Border protection.

E&OE……………………….…………………………………………………………………

DAVID OLDFIELD:

The Opposition Leader is in the Central Coast this morning and he joins me on the line. Tony, good  morning.

TONY ABBOTT:

Morning David.

DAVID OLDFIELD:

Look, you were briefed yesterday by Immigration Department bureaucrats. What did they tell you about the  circumstances of Malaysia, the Pacific Solution, what have they told you?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, there wasn’t really much detail on Malaysia. Essentially their message was that it was very, very  important that we have offshore processing in order to prevent a flood of arrivals. Now, that’s not news. The  Coalition has always supported offshore processing and I guess I wondered, as I was listening to the  briefing, if this is the advice that they were giving to the Government, why did the Government close down  offshore processing and why hasn’t the Government got offshore processing going long before this?  Because they were certainly adamant that we needed offshore processing but that’s hardly a message that the  Opposition needed to hear.

DAVID OLDFIELD:

No, indeed. It’s indeed a message you’ve been trying to convey to the Government for a long time as indeed  was seen with the great success of the Howard policies for Nauru and the Pacific Solution. Now, our  understanding is that the Government’s bureaucrats told you that the Pacific Solution, such as Nauru or  Manus, wouldn’t work a second time around. Is that correct?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, they said that it wouldn’t work on its own and…

DAVID OLDFIELD:

….right…..

TONY ABBOTT:

… the Coalition has never said that we needed just Nauru and just Manus, we’ve always said that there were  three essential ingredients: first of all you’ve got to have Nauru, then you’ve got to have temporary  protection visas and third you’ve got to have the option of turning boats around and that’s always been our  policy. Now, the Government doesn’t want temporary protection visas, it doesn’t want to turn boats around  and it hasn’t actually been able to get offshore processing going anywhere, because the one country that’s  happy to do offshore processing is Nauru, and that’s the one place that they don’t want to ask. And I thought  it was just bizarre to have the Prime Minister sitting next to the President of Nauru, but failing to mention  the one subject that must have been on both of their minds and I gather the Prime Minister’s now rushing  back home to avoid the gala dinner - perhaps she thought she might have to dance with the President of  Nauru and the very topic might have come up.

DAVID OLDFIELD:

Well, certainly PM Julia Gillard dancing with the President of Nauru might actually move us towards a  better solution for the Australian people. I mean, it does seem absolutely utterly irresponsible of Julia Gillard  whilst in the company of the President of Nauru not to discuss these matters. I said on radio the other day  that it was just an example of her extraordinary stubbornness and the fact that she was filled with pride and  just simply unwilling to go back to a policy that evidently worked. Would you think that that was an unfair  statement?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well no, I think that really summarises it pretty well, David. John Howard got it essentially right on border  protection and this Government has been really pathologically terrified of admitting that. I guess people like  the Prime Minister, spent years demonising John Howard and demonising the Pacific Solution - she called it  ‘costly, unsustainable and wrong in principle’ - and to have to admit now that basically Howard was right  does require a magnanimity that we have not yet seen from this Prime Minister or this Government.

DAVID OLDFIELD:

If you’ve just joined me, David Oldfield on 2UE, speaking to Opposition Leader Tony Abbott. The Pacific  Solution, the High Court, Malaysia, where to from here? Bureaucrats have briefed him. The Government  continues to run away from the obvious solution; look to the past for the answer. We can see that and  indeed, Tony, on that, Minister Bowen continues to run away from this but you know the figures even better  than I do. A quick check by me this morning suggested that in the five years prior to Mr Rudd coming to  power in 2007 there were in the order of less than 300 people who arrived by this means, by these  unauthorised boats; yet when he then changed the laws and put out the welcome mat we’ve since that time  something in the order of 12,000 arrive. How on earth can the Government pretend that it wasn’t them that  were completely and utterly responsible for the changes that have brought more and more of these people to  our shores?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well that’s right and now of course the Prime Minister is in denial about the need to talk to the President of  Nauru and we still don’t have a policy from the Government. The High Court torpedoed their existing policy  last week. They now need to come up with a new policy. Now, if their policy is still Malaysia let the Prime

Minister say so, if their policy is Manus and Nauru let her say so, but at the moment she’s sending officials  out to brief people on what they think, but the Government won’t tell us what it thinks and this is really yet  another failure of leadership on the part of the Prime Minister because it’s not the officials who set the  policy, it’s the Government who sets the policy.

DAVID OLDFIELD:

Given the circumstances of what the High Court has done with Malaysia and a situation that will still cost  the Australian taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars, is it correct that we are absolutely stuck with still  taking the 4,000 from Malaysia even though we won’t get to send them the measly 800?

TONY ABBOTT:

I fear we are. I think we have a moral obligation to Malaysia. Let’s face it, it’s not their fault that we can’t  send them the 800; it’s the Government’s fault that we can’t send them the 800. So, I think we do have a  moral obligation to Malaysia having entered into this bad deal. We’ve now got to honour our side of it, but  we shouldn’t blame the Malaysians for this we should blame the Prime Minister and the Government.

DAVID OLDFIELD:

History has shown the boats can be stopped. You’re willing to do that. You’ve expressed a willingness it  would seem publicly to work with the Prime Minister. Are you willing to continue in that vein? Will you  work with them if she’ll let you?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, as I’ve said repeatedly, David, if she wants to put beyond legal doubt the ability of the Australian  Government to send illegal boat arrivals to Manus or Nauru or both we are happy to cooperate in changing  the legislation because let’s face it, Manus and Nauru were part of the Pacific Solution under John Howard,  they were part of policies that worked and if the Government wants to put them beyond legal doubt in the  wake of the High Court’s decision, only too happy to cooperate.

DAVID OLDFIELD:

There are reports this morning that we could face a European style as it’s explained - and I suppose people  are talking about all the disruptions in France, in Denmark, in Holland and most specifically the terrible riots  experienced in London - that we could face that here amongst the asylum seekers, as they’re sometimes  called, and Australian citizens because of the overflow of the large numbers that would come meaning that  all of these people would have to be put into the community rather than in detention centres because of their  vast numbers. Are you concerned about the expectation of that disharmony?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, given that the Immigration Department has presumably been giving the same advice to the  Government for years now, I just wonder why they haven’t taken more decisive action sooner on the whole  question of border protection. I mean, if as the Immigration Department thinks offshore processing is  absolutely essential, why did the Government close down the Pacific Solution in 2008 and why hasn’t it  resumed offshore processing long before now? Why won’t it talk to the President of Nauru right now  because the one country which is only too happy to resume offshore processing for Australia is Nauru?

DAVID OLDFIELD:

Would you question whether the current policies, immigration wise, of this Government are actually in the  interests of our existing Australian population?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I think it’s in no one’s interest to have the kind of chaos on our borders which we now have, David.  I  mean, I think that Australia should have a strong immigration programme and I think when you’ve got a  Government that’s lost control of our borders it brings the immigration programme into some discredit and I  think that’s bad for everyone. I think that the Australian people, whether they were born here or came here,  expect newcomers to come in the front door not the back door and when you’ve got so obviously, people  coming in the back door, everyone gets very angry about it and I think the migrants that have done the right  thing are entitled to get angrier than just about anyone else.

DAVID OLDFIELD:

If you were prime minister tomorrow would we see the changes that would stop these boats as we saw  during the course of the Howard administration?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, David, look almost the first thing you do would be pick up the phone to the President of Nauru and get  that detention centre operating as quickly as possible. Obviously you’d have to talk to the Navy about what  might be done in terms of better interdiction of boats and you’d reintroduce temporary protection visas and I  believe that could be done very swiftly as well. So, you could be absolutely certain that were there a change  of government there would be swift and dramatic changes in border protection policy.

DAVID OLDFIELD:

Opposition Leader Tony Abbott, grateful for your time.

TONY ABBOTT:

Thanks so much David.

DAVID OLDFIELD:

All the best to you.
