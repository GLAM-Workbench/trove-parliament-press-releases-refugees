E&OE……………………….…………………………………………………………………

KARL STEFANOVIC:

G'day, Tony.

TONY ABBOTT:

G'day, Karl.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

Let’s start with the front page of The Australian today. Treasury is warning that the European crisis is spiralling out of  control and expects the government to dump its commitment to surplus if a new crisis sweeps the world. Is that the  responsible thing to do in light of this news out of Europe?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, Karl, the problem is that the Australian government tried to spend its way out of a crisis caused by too much  spending. Now, I accept that other governments around the world, many of them did something similar, but that's the  basic problem. You can't spend your way out of a crisis caused by too much spending and in the case of the Australian  government so much of the spending was of poor quality. You had the overpriced school halls, you had the pink batts  disaster. We are still spending money now three years after the event on the Building the Education Revolution  programme and we are, at this very moment, sending out cheques with letters headed up Cash For You on borrowed  money. Now this is the problem that we've got. We've got a government which is addicted to spending when what we  need to do is to live within our means and that's the issue for the whole world. We have to live within our means.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

Would you be comfortable though to drift into deficit in order to ride through this next crisis is the question?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well I accept that in a crisis the so-called automatic stabilisers will operate to change the overall fiscal position but what I  say, Karl, is that this government should not have got us in to this position by spending too much too soon in response to  the first GFC.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

Ok, let’s move on. These posters of which you are front and centre, the star in fact, hanging in the Health Minister Tanya

Plibersek’s office - they say I’m threatened by boats and gays, gays on boats are my worst nightmare and note to the  ladies making a sandwich. Are you offended by those posters?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well I think they're really tacky Karl. I think they’re really tacky. I think that Tanya Plibersek should be bigger than that and  it’s I think typical of the kind of nasty personal attacks that we're going to see from the Labor Party. I mean, there's a lot of  talk at the moment Karl about the tone of the parliament being lowered. By far the most vicious things that have been said  in politics this year were the things the Labor Party said about Kevin Rudd who was carpet bombed, the things the Labor  Party said about Campbell Newman in Queensland and what we see with this poster is a foretaste of the kind of election  campaign the Labor Party are going to run.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

Both sides are guilty of this though at the moment and I think it’s fair to say that everyone is sick of it.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, obviously we should try to be our best selves at all times but I just don't accept, Karl, this moral equivalence doctrine.  Look at the way Kevin Rudd was treated by his own party. Look at the disgraceful attacks on Campbell Newman which  Anna Bligh eventually admitted had no foundation whatsoever.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

Are you threatened by gays?

TONY ABBOTT:

No.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

Boats?

TONY ABBOTT:

I want to stop the boats, but all of us should want to stop the boats. And Tanya Plibersek wants to send boat people to  Malaysia...

KARL STEFANOVIC:

Are you threatened…

TONY ABBOTT:

…and that's a cruel deal for boat people as well as being a dud deal for us.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

Are you threatened by gays on boats?

TONY ABBOTT:

Come on, Karl

KARL STEFANOVIC:

Well it's ridiculous.

TONY ABBOTT:

Of course it’s ridiculous. It's tacky. It’s tacky…

KARL STEFANOVIC:

So why worry about? If it's so ridiculous, why worry about it is the call?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well Karl, you're the one asking me the questions.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

No, it was raised in Parliament yesterday and became a big deal.

TONY ABBOTT:

It’s tacky, it’s not funny and Tanya Plibersek should be better than that and the Labor Party should lift its game.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

Alright, you are battling, you must concede, the perception out there that you are negative. This was the Prime Minister in  parliament.

JULIA GILLARD:

Aggressive negativity. Reckless scare campaign. Aggressive Negativity.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

Now I’m willing to concede that she's being negative in the way that she's portraying you as being negative. However, do  you think that you are battling that and do you think that you can in fact overcome that?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look Karl, I think anyone who watched Parliament this week would know who the relentlessly negative one was. I mean  The Prime Minister dropped a bucket of bile on the opposition every day in Parliament this week.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

Right, so what I’m asking you is, do you think the public perceives you as being negative and that whatever the  government is doing in terms of accusing you of being negative is working because the public do think you're negative?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I’d ask people to look at what I'm actually doing and, for instance, my proposal for a more flexible child care system,  my proposal for a fair dinkum paid parental leave scheme, my proposals for a green army to rescue Australia from our  land care problems, my proposals for new water storages particularly in the north so that we really can be a food bowl for

Asia. Look, this is an opposition which is very effectively getting at this government and that's what they don't like. That's  why we see the viciousness in the Parliament but I think we're also establishing ourselves as a strong and credible  alternative with strong plans for a stronger economy, for a stronger Australia.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

That’s the most positive you've been all week. Now I want to finish with this one though. I want to finish with you in the  chamber but before we get to the vision and our editors have been very creative and mixed it with a lovely song. I want to  know that you're emotionally ok with me to do this with you though, because it’s not negative, it’s quite positive?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look Karl, the only thing that upsets me about the footage you're going to show is that I was beaten by Christopher Pyne.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

Alright, let’s go to the vision…Sing along Tony!

TONY ABBOTT:

Oh look it’s... Sorry, it’s too low for me, I’m a tenor.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

Do you see the funny side of it now?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well I’m always prepared Karl, as you know, to run in support of my principles.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

Very clever, Mr Abbott. Thank you for your time today. As always, have a great weekend.

TONY ABBOTT:

And you too Karl.
