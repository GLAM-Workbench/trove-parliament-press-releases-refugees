E&OE……………………….………………………………………………………………………………..

TONY ABBOTT:

I’m always happy to see more money going into health and I accept that aged care services certainly do  deserve a boost and it is important to have better aged care services if we are going to get frail aged people  out of public hospitals and into more appropriate care settings.

But it’s hard to take this announcement of Mr Rudd’s seriously. It does seem to be part of an ongoing series  of PR announcements. It seems more like a PR exercise than a well thought out health plan. If it was a well  thought out health plan, why weren’t all these announcements made together? I think it’s very  understandable that the states are saying that they really can’t consider anything more prior to COAG unless  they are given all the details on all these announcements including any subsequent announcements that he  might have in mind.

The other point to make is that this is a Prime Minister who’s big on announcements but bad on delivery.  Prior to the last election, he announced 2,000 additional aged care places - less than 300 of these have been  delivered. Prior to the last election, he announced an additional thousand aged care nurses - there are fewer  than 200 that are now in the system. So, again, this is a government which is much more talk than real  action. This is a government which is much better at making promises than actually delivering on them.

QUESTION:

Nurses a short time ago expressed their concern with the Rudd government’s plan saying that they don’t  think that it is going to deliver the extra staff necessary to create these 5,000 extra places.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I think that’s right for them to be concerned. I mean, we are dealing here with very complex issues.  We are dealing here with deep-seated problems and the idea that these glib announcements that are made  one day and forgotten the next day and every Prime Ministerial announcement leaves a trail of frantic  bureaucrats scrambling in its wake, all tripping over themselves trying to actually make some sense of all of  this. The idea that these glib announcements made one day, forgotten the next are going to solve our  problems I just think is very implausible.

QUESTION:

Have you seen Mr Roger Corbett’s comments about the Rudd health plan and are you surprised that a  comment like that would be made by a director of the Reserve Bank?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, what really surprises me is that Mr Rudd appeared not to be aware of them. Now, Roger Corbett is an  extremely senior businessman, he’s a member of the Reserve Bank Board, he’s been the Chairman of the  last serious hospital board left in New South Wales, the Children’s Hospital Board, for many years and I’m  just wondering whether Mr Rudd’s been on holidays for the last few days not knowing about Mr Corbett’s  comments.

QUESTION:

Should parents, do you think, Mr Abbott, supervise numeracy and literacy tests next month if the teachers  decide to boycott the exams?

TONY ABBOTT:

I know that parents play a big part in schools and they should play a big part in schools, but it’s wrong to  expect them to do teachers’ jobs for them and I’d expect the government to try to work out for these exams  to be fully professionally administered and supervised and asking parents to come in, in effect as strike  breakers, doesn’t sound like Julia Gillard is on top of her job.

QUESTION:

Would it be worthwhile paying the money to hire supervisors rather than surrender to the threat from the  Australian Education Union should it still exist then?

TONY ABBOTT:

I don’t think governments should surrender to threats from unions but I think governments should ensure  that services are delivered professionally and getting parents to come in and administer tests or supervise  exams doesn’t strike me like it’s a professional way of running schools.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, just on boat people, this story in today’s Tele suggesting that boats are still expected to arrive  despite the government’s suspension of its visa programme. What are your comments on that?

TONY ABBOTT:

It’s typical of this government that it would make an announcement without necessarily expecting it to bring  about a different outcome. I mean, this is a government which makes an announcement a day without ever  making much of a difference and we know that the only thing that this government did which has made a  difference was ending the border protection policies of the Howard government, which has produced the  current influx of boat people.

Under the Howard government, for the last five years we had something like three boats a year. Under the  current government we’re getting three boats a week and if these reports today are correct we can expect a  mini-Armada of boats over the next few weeks trying to beat these rule changes.

Now, even as things stood, the processing period was some months long on average unless of course you  were lucky enough to hijack an Australian boat and then get special treatment. So, I don’t imagine that the  people smugglers are going to be too scared by this latest announcement from the Rudd government.

QUESTION:

You appointed a border protection committee around February 12, 13, or so, pretty high-powered - Philip  Ruddock, Julie Bishop on it. Is it about time that they reported with a policy?

TONY ABBOTT:

We will have a comprehensive policy on this in good time before the next election.

QUESTION:

But not now when the debate is on?

TONY ABBOTT:

Not today. But we will have a comprehensive policy on this as we will on all the major matters before the  Australian public in good time before the next election.

QUESTION:

Can we go to the reason that we’re here which is you sitting on a bike for large slabs of the day. Do you shift  into a sort of zen zone when you ride or what is the feeling doing these extraordinary rides?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well it’s not such an extraordinary ride, Malcolm. I mean, this is something that I’ve been doing for 13  years and for me it’s a good way of seeing people in a different context. I suspect that the people I was  running into in the street and meeting with in Cooma this morning, I suspect that the people in Berridale  would have had a slightly different attitude to a politician who’d just rocked up in the white car in the usual  way. So for me this is a way of engaging with people on a quite different level to the usual political  engagement.

While I’m on the bike, depending on how fast we’re trying to go, I’m sometimes focusing entirely on  keeping up with the next bloke or I might be focusing on chatting to the person beside me or I might be  simply enjoying the scenery or in the case of yesterday looking at the coming weather and feeling a bit  intimidated by it all.

QUESTION:

And what’s the satisfaction like for you to do, such as yesterday?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well I think most people like to set themselves a challenge and meet it and I guess for all sorts of people it’s  different. But the idea of setting goals and meeting them I think is important for nearly all people and I guess  this is my way of setting goals and hopefully meeting them.

Ok, thanks so much.

SUBSEQUENT DOORSTOP FOLLOWING JULIA GILLARD’S BER INQUIRY  ANNOUNCEMENT

TONY ABBOTT:

After months of denying that there was a problem, the announcement of this inquiry is a monumental  backflip by the government and still it’s a Clayton’s inquiry. It doesn’t appear that this inquiry will have the  power to compel witnesses to return and to answer questions and I think this is an inquiry that is designed to  cover things up, not to get to the truth.

What we need to know is were reasonable procedures followed and has this programme been value for  money and on the basis of the evidence so far, reasonable procedures weren’t followed, money was in most  cases channelled through state education departments which don’t have a history of getting good value and  project after project just reverted to rip-off after rip-off.

QUESTION:

[inaudible] calling for a judicial inquiry?

TONY ABBOTT:

The only way to get to the bottom of this is a full judicial inquiry. This is, as I said, a Clayton’s inquiry  which is designed to whitewash this through the election.

QUESTION:

Three months time for this inquiry. That’s reasonable, isn’t it?

TONY ABBOTT:

Again, I think it’s important that the inquiry report before the election because I think this is going to be a  very important election issue but it’s got to be a proper inquiry that has very wide terms of reference, which  can compel witnesses to appear, compel them to answer questions, to compel government agencies to  surrender documents and which above all else is charged with determining whether the government got  value for money and whether the government should’ve known that it wasn’t getting value for money.

But again, this is part of a pattern of failure from this government. There is almost no major programme that  this government has announced which hasn’t either been seriously modified or is now the subject of major  inquiry because the programme just hasn’t been delivered competently.
