THE HON RICHARD MARLES MP  SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND BORDER  PROTECTION  MEMBER FOR CORIO



MEDIA RELEASE

GOVERNMENT SLAMMED FOR AXING LEGAL HELP

Shadow Immigration and Border Protection Minister Richard Marles has slammed the  Abbott Government for scrapping the Immigration Advice and Application Assistance  Scheme.

The long-standing program provides legal assistance and advice to asylum seekers,  including help completing arrival documentation.

This mean-spirited announcement from Immigration Minister Scott Morrison will  make a difficult situation even worse, ripping away assistance for people who have  been through traumatic experiences and are often vulnerable.

This is an unfair and harsh announcement from a Government with twisted  priorities.
