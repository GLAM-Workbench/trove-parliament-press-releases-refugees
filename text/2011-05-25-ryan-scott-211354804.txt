E&OE……………………….…………………………………………………………………

TONY ABBOTT:

ItÃ¢ÂÂs good to be here at the Hawker IGA in chilly Canberra. IÃ¢ÂÂm pleased to be with Robert Krnc who is the  store owner and also with Senator Scott Ryan who is the Parliamentary Secretary for Small Business. There  are thousands of items in this IGA, in the stores that local people are buying every day and every single one  of them will go up in price under Julia GillardÃ¢ÂÂs carbon tax.

The Food and Grocery Council has estimated that the price of groceries will go up by five per cent under a  $26 a tonne carbon tax. That means for the average person who spends $200 a week on groceries theyÃ¢ÂÂll  need $10 a week more in their wallets just at the checkout. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs a $10 a week hit on the average person  thanks to this toxic tax, this toxic and unnecessary tax from this Government. So I think thereÃ¢ÂÂs a very strong  message that is going out to the Prime Minister from the shoppers of Australia: Ã¢ÂÂlisten to us and donÃ¢ÂÂt  proceed with this toxic tax.Ã¢ÂÂ

Now, the Prime Minister is running around the countryside saying Ã¢ÂÂoh, donÃ¢ÂÂt you worry because thereÃ¢ÂÂll be  compensation.Ã¢ÂÂ Well, there is no compensation for small business. There is no compensation for people who  lose their jobs and any compensation that this Prime Minister gives is going to be eroded over time. The tax  will be permanent, the compensation will be temporary and the tax will just go up and up and up. I think the  Prime Minister will want to start it low but donÃ¢ÂÂt believe that it will stay low. Any promise that she makes  about compensation, any promise that she makes about the tax staying low is as believable as her promise  before the last election “there will be no carbon tax under the government I lead” because the two constants  about this Prime Minister and this Government are incompetence and untrustworthiness. It is a  fundamentally incompetent and a fundamentally untrustworthy Government.

Now, IÃ¢ÂÂm going to ask Scott to say a few words then I might ask Robert if he could just say a few words.

SCOTT RYAN:

Thanks Tony. What weÃ¢ÂÂve seen today from this great local business is how every shopping trolley of every  Australian is going to be hit every day and every week by LaborÃ¢ÂÂs carbon tax. Every product in there is

going to go up in price, particularly fresh food and particularly domestically produced food.

TONY ABBOTT:

Robert?

ROBERT KRNC:

Yeah, just at the end of the day everyone is going to suffer if this gets passed and we just donÃ¢ÂÂt need it, I  donÃ¢ÂÂt think. We need to live the way weÃ¢ÂÂre going and we need to keep on doing what weÃ¢ÂÂre doing, I think.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, thanks Robert. Thank you so much and let me just say that this shop has been beautifully renovated at  great expense over the last 18 months or so and one of the very sensible changes that Robert has made has  been to put in freezers and fridges with doors. That is sensible, intelligent direct action, energy saving,  emissions reducing measure thatÃ¢ÂÂs been taken but despite this, this is a business which has an electricity bill  of almost $150,000 a year, a $26 a tonne carbon tax is going to hit this business with an extra $35,000 or  more extra every year.

Ok, any questions?

QUESTION:

The Greens have pulled back somewhat on their hardline stance on the $40 a tonne for carbon. Does this  mean that, you know, people are going to be paying less once this gets through?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I think itÃ¢ÂÂs clear that the Prime Minister is going to try to start the carbon tax as low as she can but no  one should believe that thatÃ¢ÂÂs where itÃ¢ÂÂs going to stay. Once this tax is in, if it comes in, it will go up and up  and up and whatever reassuring noises the Greens make now be confident of two things. First of all, they are  running this Government because Julia Gillard canÃ¢ÂÂt do anything without getting the GreensÃ¢ÂÂ permission and  second, they want this tax up and up and up because whatever they might say now they donÃ¢ÂÂt like the coal  industry, there are vast aspects of our modern way of life that the Greens regard as wrong. So as far as the  Greens are concerned, no carbon tax is going to be high enough to satisfy them.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, would you support a ban on political donations from tobacco companies? The Greens are  planning to introduce a bill on that I think when the Senate next sits?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, I think that political parties should be able to receive donations from legal business.

QUESTION:

How about that cigarette packaging? Is the Coalition closer to making a decision on that issue?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, weÃ¢ÂÂll make a decision on that issue when we see the GovernmentÃ¢ÂÂs legislation.

QUESTION:

Have you spoken to Alex Somlyay and Ken Wyatt about the suggestions that they may want to cross the  floor?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, I have lots of conversations with lots of people and they stay private conversations as far as IÃ¢ÂÂm  concerned.

QUESTION:

ItÃ¢ÂÂs been reported that you spoke of a tectonic shift in the electorate yesterday in the party room. Can you  elaborate on that or confirm it?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, I donÃ¢ÂÂt comment on what may or may not be said inside the party room. But I certainly think that right  across Australia, including in what were once Labor Party heartlands, people are saying that this  Government is not listening. This Government is making our cost of living pressures worse and the most  obvious example of the fact that this Government is not listening and this Government has abandoned the  people who used to support the Labor Party is the carbon tax. Again, letÃ¢ÂÂs not forget that this carbon tax is  wrong on two counts. First, itÃ¢ÂÂs going to drive up everyoneÃ¢ÂÂs cost of living and itÃ¢ÂÂs going to destroy jobs big  time. It wonÃ¢ÂÂt clean up the environment but it will clean out your wallet and wipe out jobs. Second, it is an  absolute betrayal of the Prime MinisterÃ¢ÂÂs pre-election commitment that “there will be no carbon tax under  the government I lead,” which is why I say that if the Prime Minister is fair dinkum, if she wants to make an  honest politician of herself, she must - repeat, must - seek a mandate before trying to sneak this tax through  the parliament.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, Kevin Rudd has been criticised for clocking up enough kilometres travelling around the world to  get him to the moon. Do you think itÃ¢ÂÂs fair that our Foreign Minister should be lambasted in this kind of  way, for travelling and putting AustralianÃ¢ÂÂs position forward overseas?

TONY ABBOTT:

Jobs, emissions and Kevin Rudd. TheyÃ¢ÂÂre the three things that the Prime Minister wants to see out of the  country.

QUESTION:

The Government is saying that their Malaysia asylum seeker swap deal is far superior to anything that you  would introduce because under their plan the asylum seekers would go to the back of the queue. Would that  be the same if they were sent to Nauru, for example?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, there is no deal with Malaysia. ThereÃ¢ÂÂs just no deal and the chances of the Government ever getting a  deal with Malaysia have been dramatically reduced by the Prime MinisterÃ¢ÂÂs panicked, premature  announcement, which means that Malaysia has the whip hand. Now the one thing that is crystal clear on  whatÃ¢ÂÂs been announced so far is that regardless of whether Malaysia takes any of the 800 asylum seekers  that the Government is talking about, weÃ¢ÂÂre going to take 4,000 people from Malaysia. So this is a really bad  deal for Australia and thatÃ¢ÂÂs if it ever comes off.

QUESTION:

[Inaudible] deal is going to be signed in the next couple of weeks, so surely thatÃ¢ÂÂs a step forward? They go  to the back of the queue.

TONY ABBOTT:

And the Prime Minister said “there will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.” You just canÃ¢ÂÂt take  anything this Government says seriously.

QUESTION:

After many months of unity in the Coalition, some small signs of ill-discipline have started to emerge.  Turnbull, Hockey, climate science and also plain cigarette packaging. Are you concerned at that at all?

TONY ABBOTT:

I just think that we are doing what weÃ¢ÂÂve always done which is to get on with the job of exposing the  mistakes of a bad Government getting worse and presenting a credible alternative. Now, thatÃ¢ÂÂs what IÃ¢ÂÂve  been doing every day since I became the leader and thatÃ¢ÂÂs what I intend to continue to do every day that I am  the leader.

QUESTION:

But how do you explain the less discipline weÃ¢ÂÂve been seeing just in the last week or so?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I just donÃ¢ÂÂt accept the premise of the question. I think that what I am doing, what my colleagues are  doing is exactly the same every day. We expose the faults of a bad Government thatÃ¢ÂÂs getting worse and we  do our best to present a credible alternative to the Australian people.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, was Greg Hunt right when he said last night on the 7:30 Report that large brown coal fired  electricity generators, or the CoalitionÃ¢ÂÂs plan to pay generators, to cut their pollution will be funded by $50  billion worth of savings identified by the Opposition and thereÃ¢ÂÂd be no cost to the taxpayer?

TONY ABBOTT:

No, Greg was absolutely right. We can reduce emissions without any increase in taxes and without any  increase in prices and without any reduction in jobs. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs the fundamental difference between our plan  which is a smart way to reduce emissions, and the GovernmentÃ¢ÂÂs plan which is an extremely dumb way to  tackle that problem.

Thanks so much.
