THE AUSTRALIAN FLAG

The Australian Flag is the symbol of our nation's unity.  It  does not need me to remind all Australians that respect for  our Flag should be encouraged.

Schools, of course, play a vital role in bringing knowledge of  the Flag and its correct use to our young people.  Some time  ago I met a group of school children who told me that the  Australian Flag was flown at their school on only one day of the

school week. I found this difficult to understand. Why don't  our schools fly our National Flag with pride daily?

This has prompted me to write this week to the Premiers and  the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory,  asking them to  encourage schools to fly the National Flag every day of the  school year.

Since May 19 79 the Flag, of course, has been available free of  charge not only to schools, but to very many other community  groups. This Commonwealth initiative was designed to foster  respect and familiarity with the symbol of our national unity. In that time more than 16,500 flags have been distributed through  members of the Federal Parliament.
