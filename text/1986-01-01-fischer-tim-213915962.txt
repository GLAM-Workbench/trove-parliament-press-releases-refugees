PHILIPPINES CAMPAIGN POSTSCRIPT

The following may be of interest after the remarkable events in  the Philippines of recent weeks, days and hours:  Just one month ago after earlier attending a Marcos rally I attended a huge  rally addressed by Cory Aquino and Doy Laurel in the outer  suburbs of Metro Manila.

It was an exciting rally on a warm night with thousands present  giving Aquino and Laurel a tremendous reception with rousing  applause. As a foreigner I did not seek to duly intrude but in  the crush of the crowd I kept hearing people saying and pointing

'American out'  so I kept saying I was an Australian and as luck  would have it I pointed to the kangaroo on my tie.

I was introduced to Doy Laurel by a leading Quezon city then  Opposition MP and after a brief conversation because he obviously  had plenty on his mind I extended greetings by saying simply  '  best of luck '  .

Laurel's reply was somewhat prophetic when he smiled pointed to  the crowd and said in reply 'we will need it but I think the  people will win out'. -
