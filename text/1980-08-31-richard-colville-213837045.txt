PRIME MINISTER INTERVIEWED BY RICHARD COLVILLE FOR  "SUNDAY REPORT", CHANNEL 10 .

Question

Prime Minister, you are off to the Commonwealth Heads of Government  Regional Meeting in Delhi, and one would assume that you will  come across some problems with India.  India will presumably . take a different point of view on matters such as Afghanistan - and Kampuchea. Are you anticipating a problem there? .

Prime Minister .

Well, there is a different point of view,but I do not think that  is a problem. Because the Commonwealth is an association in which . .   different countries from different backgrounds do have differing  points of view. That has never been a bar to constructive,   co-operative Commonwealth action. Because one of the strengths  of the modern Commonwealth - where you have all sorts of different

countries, all sorts of different people involved in it - is that  in spite of their differing perspectives, differing policies on .   many occasions, they have been able to make a very real .   contribution to the peace and well-being of their members and often

to the wider world. So the fact.that some countries will have  differing views at this particular meeting is only to be expected.  That is not a problem, it is just part of the Commonwealth.

Question. _ .  .  Â·  .  .

Do you expect to come under some criticism, though, for your' . continued acceptance and recognition of the Pol Pot regime?

Prime Minister .  .  ,

Well, recognition/ but not acceptance in any way in which we would  approve of what Pol Pot has done. Because I really believe what,  the Pol Pot regime perpetrated in earlier years in relation to  the Kampuchean people, was about the loathsome thing that any  Government had.ever done.  But other governments have also been  pretty horrible: Idi Amin; the Soviet Union in the 1930s; and Vietnam now.  Vietnam has. caused more refugees, more boat people,  hundreds of thousands of. whom drowned at sea, forcibly expelled

from Vietnam; and nobody suggests that we should withdraw  recognition from Vietnam as a result of that brutality. But, I  can see that Pol Pot is a loathsome regime. I would prefer, in a  sense, that Australia did not have to have any part of it. But it

is not as simple as that. A step away from Pol Pot is a step .

towards Heng Samrin and Vietnam. If you de-recognise, everyone  would know that you are not going to recognise Pol Pot ever again,  so the Vietnamese would say: "ah, for the next step is to recognise  our puppet regime" which is kept there by over 200,000 troops

supported,by the Soviet Union to the tune of $3 million a day. Now, because a move away from Pol Pot will encourage.Vietnam - that  is one reason why it should not be done at this sf-aaR. while Vietnam  shows no sign of being prepared to have a polit

Prime Minister (continued).

The other reason, of course, is that -the ASEAN countries are .   right in the front line of the problems caused by Vietnam. There -   have, been incursions of Vietnamese forces*across the border into  Thailand. Then there are the others:  Malaysia, Singapore,

Indonesia and the Philippines. They have a view. It is one thing .   for Britain, on the other side of the world, to take a. view. It is ~ -  another thing for Australia in this part of the world.Â·'Â· Ã¢ÂÂ   ,  .  Where we can,I think we need.to support other.countries that have  a view, especially when we can understand the reasons for that and.  when, we know they are in the front line of the. difficulties, caused ’   by the Vietnamese invasion. None of that gives any element of -  approval to Pol Pot and what .Pol Pot has done, because .  .  .  -  ; Â· . . ' . that it really is one of the most horrible regimes,  perhaps the "   most loathsome regime, that ever had power over a country.  .

Question Â· .  .  Â·  .  .  Ã¢ÂÂ   .  .

Presumably, also the Heads of Government in looking at the world' .   .picture,..will be discussing.what is .going on in Poland, and d Russia's coming problems, with Poland. What is Australia's position  there? Ã¢ÂÂ   Â·  .  .  ’  . .  .  .  .  :  Â·  .  Ã¢ÂÂ   .  Â·  Ã¢ÂÂ

Prime Minister

It's the position of many other Western countries. Poland Â· ' - ' * Â· is tragically a prisoner not .only of the Soviet Union and.the ,; communist system,lit is. also, a prisoner of Polish geography;   surrounded byÂ· communist states, next door, to the Soviet. Union -  carved up in the late 30s,  early 40s, by Germany on the one side  and by Russia on the next,, and invaded by Russia for the secondÂ·   time, colonised by. Russia with a communist regime in place. What Â·  .   the trade unionists in Poland are doing is struggling for some . Â· . . Â· .   of those basic elements of human freedom which you and I, and . every other Australian, takes so much for granted;that we: do not. . even have to.think abbtit it. It is part of our.daily lives. So the courage of the...Polish people is something, to be enormously ;   applauded. I hope.that they are successful. I hope that the gains

that they have won will be enshrined and maintained* Because that  will.be perhaps the first chink in the monolithic domination of .   the communist system; over Eastern Europe...1  If they push: it too hardÂ­ or too fast - not too. hard or too far in terms’  of what is right because what they are pursuing is right in its totality - but if .

they push beyond a certain point, there is not the slightest doubt  that the Soviet Union will use her tanks and her armies, as the .  . Soviet Union did in the case of Czecholovakia and in the case of ‘   Hungary.  In an iironic sort of way, the Polish people on this Â·  Ã¢ÂÂ  Â·  '  .   occasion might be spared those Russian tanks because of the strength  of the free world, . . . .  Islamic world, Â· : , Â· . Â· Â·  Western world, and . Third World opposition to the. Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. .  -Even the Soviet Union is to some extent .  ,  . .  . . .  Â·  '

sensitive to world pressure.  There is no doubt that the reaction  against .the Soviet Union would.be overwhelming if they moved their. .   tanks and'their’army into Poland. I suspect that they are .  : conscious of that. But I am also sure if it goes too far, if -it is  going -.to damage, as they believe, the continuity and permanency  of .  communism and all the rigidity and strictures, that thateimplies

on human decency and human feeling: then, those tanks will roll. So, those sentiments can be expressed. But in terms of practical support from Western Europe or from the United States, I am sure .  the Polish people know that they really are on their own, with '

their own resources: with the moral force, of the world - but that is no help against tanks. It just indicates the enormous courage .   and tenacity of the Polish people and of the Polish spirit.
