EO&E...........................................................................................................................................

TONY ABBOTT:

It’s terrific to be here at the Whittlesea RSL with Donna Petrovich, our candidate for McEwen. I am really proud of Donna

Petrovich. Donna has given up a relatively safe seat in the state parliament to be our candidate for McEwen. It’s a big margin. On  paper it’s nine per cent. The fact that she is prepared to take the risk of running in a seat like this shows how committed she is to

our country, how committed she is to the Coalition and how committed she is to the people of McEwen who have been neglected  for too long.

We have the right team and we have the right plan. For the last three years we’ve had the same strong team and the same strong

policies. While yesterday was the fifth reshuffle from this government in just three years, there’s been a great consistency from the  Coalition for three years. Should we win the election, you’ll get the same strength and the same consistency.

This is a very, very important election. It is a very, very clear choice. On the one hand, you’ve got the government which has given

us the five biggest deficits in our history versus the Coalition who previously gave us the four biggest surpluses in our history.

You’ve got the government which jacked the carbon tax up yesterday, against the Coalition, which will abolish the carbon tax, lock  stock and barrel.

You have the government which started the boats. You’ve got the Coalition which stopped the boats.

You have got the government which is completely uninterested in the East West Link. The Coalition that will make the East West

Link happen by investing $1.5 billion in it.

So it’s a very, very important choice. It’s a choice between division and dysfunction under the Labor Party, or stability and  certainty under the Coalition.

The only thing that was certain under Julia Gillard was the election date. Even that is uncertain now under Kevin Rudd. I say to

the Prime Minister, end the suspense and name the date. End the suspense and name the date. The Australian people deserve  to know when finally the people can reclaim the government of our country, reclaim the government, determine who the Prime

Minister is, take it out of the hands of the faceless men and put it back into the hands of the people.

I’m going to ask Donna to say a few words and then I will take some questions.

DONNA PETROVICH:

Thanks Tony. It’s great to have you here in Whittlesea today. It is wonderful for this community. The seat of McEwen has been  neglected for a very long time under Labor. I think the choice is becoming clearer. An Abbott Coalition government is the right

choice for Australia. We will see no ifs, no buts but a removal of this insidious carbon tax which delivers nothing to assist our  environment. It’s just a big cash grab.

TONY ABBOTT:

Ok. Thank you so much. Do we have any questions?

QUESTION:

Kevin Rudd is meeting business leaders this morning. Is he moving in on your patch?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, it’s good that he is prepared to have that meeting but the question is, what’s changed? What’s changed? Has there been  any change announced today? Has the carbon tax been abolished? No. Has the attack on skilled migration been changed? No.

Has the government announced there will be less regulation on business? No. Nothing has changed. All that has happened is a  conversation but we know from Mr Rudd's previous record that he is all talk and no action.

QUESTION:

Do you believe you need to reshuffle your frontbench?

TONY ABBOTT:

I have a very strong frontbench. The fact that the Labor Party is constantly reshuffling its Cabinet and replacing the Prime Minister

is proof that the Coalition is more than a match for Labor's C Team.

QUESTION:

It might be too large though if you win Government, you might have to get rid of them?

TONY ABBOTT:

I am very confident that the team that I take to the election would be the team that would form a strong and stable government  afterwards should we win.

QUESTION:

What about some of the talent in your ranks. Will you look at promoting them after an election win?

TONY ABBOTT:

I am very conscious of the fact that I do have a lot of talent on the backbench. The Prime Minister was obviously really struggling

to find people to put in his Cabinet, particularly given that so many of Labor's best had refused to serve. This is the sad reality of  the modern Labor Party, the best refused to serve and to see a very significant Labor figure like Simon Crean refuse to serve in

Kevin Rudd's Cabinet and announce he is leaving the Parliament, that’s a sad day for Australia - a very sad day for Australia, but  a terrible indictment on Mr Rudd and his Cabinet.

QUESTION:

Why won’t you agree to a debate against him?

TONY ABBOTT:

I am very happy to have debates with Mr Rudd. If he wants to recall the Parliament, we will debate every day. If he wants to name

the election date, well, obviously we’ll have election debates. So I just say to Mr Rudd, if you want to have a formal debate, name  the election date and let the debate begin.

QUESTION:

Why should you limit it to the election campaign period?

TONY ABBOTT:

I am very happy to debate the issues and I’m debating the issues every day. What I say to Mr Rudd today is end the suspense,

name the date, and then of course the election debate can begin.

QUESTION:

There were some pretty racist comments put on the Facebook wall of Ed Husic, for swearing on the Koran yesterday. What did  you make of that?

TONY ABBOTT:

I respect his choice.

QUESTION:

What do you think of some of the sentiment that’s been expressed on the Facebook page since then?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I’m not familiar with it but as I said, I respect his choice and I think the Australian people should as well.

QUESTION:

Kevin Rudd is exploring ways to send home economic refugees, what is the Coalition stance on that?

TONY ABBOTT:

Four years and he has finally woken up to the fact that the vast majority of these people are not fair dinkum refugees. They are  economic migrants, pure and simple. Now, I can understand why people from horrible countries would want to come to Australia. I

can understand that, but they have got to come in the front door, not the back door. The tragedy of modern Australia, the tragedy  of life in Australia under Kevin Rudd is that the people smugglers and not the Australian people and government, are increasingly

in charge of our immigration intake. Now, let's be absolutely blunt about this, Kevin Rudd is the best friend the people smugglers  have ever had. John Howard put them out of business. Kevin Rudd put them back in business and the only person that will put

them out of business again is me.

QUESTION:

You want to abolish the carbon tax. Would you be prepared to back a switch to an ETS as a halfway measure under Labor?

TONY ABBOTT:

What people need to understand is that a tax is a tax is a tax is a tax. Whether it is a fixed tax or a floating tax, it is still a tax. If we  were to move to an emissions trading scheme, we are basically saying to bureaucrats in Europe, you can set tax rates in

Australia. We have seen the disaster of the Euro in Europe. Why would we have an environmental Euro here in Australia?

QUESTION:

Have you changed your stance on the local government referendum?

TONY ABBOTT:

This is something that has been comprehensively mishandled by the government. They ignored the advice of the Spigelman  committee. They failed to consult properly with the state governments. They were very unfair in the allocation of money between

the ‘yes’ and ‘no’ camps. The ‘yes’ camp is getting 40 times the funding that the ‘no’ camp is getting and finally, they gagged the  debate through the Senate. This thing has been done badly and undemocratically. I certainly think there is a case for ensuring

that existing federal programmes for local government can continue without constitutional doubt. I have enormous reservations  about the way the government has done this and I say to the Australian people if you don't understand it, don't vote for it. If you're

not fully persuaded, don't vote for it because our constitution is far too important to be trifled with.

QUESTION:

Are you having a bob each way because of divisions within the Coalition?

TONY ABBOTT:

There is strong support for doing things the right way but there is no support for doing things the wrong way. What this  government has done is, as so often the case, done it the wrong way from start to finish.

Thank you.
