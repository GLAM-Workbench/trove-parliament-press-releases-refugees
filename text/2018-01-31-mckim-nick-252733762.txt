Liberals game laws to deliberately harm people owed protection

Leaked cabinet documents show the extent to which the Liberals have undermined the law to deliberately cause harm to people they know are owed protection.

"Scott Morrison and his successor Peter Dutton have gamed this country's laws in order to deliberately harm refugees," Greens Immigration Spokesperson Senator Nick McKim said.

"Morrison and his department deliberately slowed applications down and put artificial barriers in the way of people whom he knew were owed protection in Australia."

"This is contrary to the rule of law and breaches the spirit, if not the letter, of the Refugee Convention."

"This is a hallmark of a totalitarian regime, not a democratic government."
