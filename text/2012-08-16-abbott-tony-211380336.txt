TONY ABBOTT:

Today is the second anniversary of the big lie, “there will be no carbon tax under the government I lead”.  The carbon tax is a bad tax. It makes every job in our economy less secure. It raises every family’s cost of  living. In the next few weeks, every Australian household will be getting their first carbon tax-impacted  power bill. As I said in the Parliament yesterday, every time power prices go up, the Prime Minister has a  smile on her face because that’s the carbon tax simply doing its job.

It’s a bad tax. It hurts jobs. It hurts cost of living and it won’t actually reduce emissions, as the  Government’s own carbon tax modelling makes crystal clear. Emissions go up by eight per cent, not down  by five per cent under the Government’s carbon tax. It is fundamentally a bad tax based on a lie. The carbon  tax is not just a broken promise. It is a breach of trust. So, when I say “there will be no carbon tax under the  government I lead” I am telling the truth.

On day one of a new government, the public service will get the instructions to prepare the carbon tax repeal  legislation. On day one of a new Parliament, the carbon tax repeal legislation will be introduced. Make no  mistake, the next election will be a referendum on the carbon tax. It will also be a referendum on Prime  Ministers who don’t tell the truth before an election and I would expect the Labor Party to respect the  mandate of any incoming Coalition government.

Also, if I may, we’ve had today a kind of reverse Tampa incident. I want to make it crystal clear that if you  want to get John Howard’s results, you’ve got to have John Howard’s resolve. John Howard met the Tampa  with the SAS. This Government has met the Parsifal with a welcoming committee. Plainly, something dire  happened on board that vessel. At the very least, it should’ve been met by the police and not simply by  officials from the Department of Immigration, waving people through into our country as this Prime  Minister has done time and time and time again.

QUESTION:

Those people are likely to go to Nauru though, Mr Abbott, aren’t they, under the new regime?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, the point I make is, with this, as with everything from this government, I’ll believe it when I see it.  This is a government which couldn’t get pink batts successfully into people’s roofs. Let’s see whether it can  successfully get illegal boats arrivals onto Nauru.

QUESTION:

Tampa stayed at sea for four days, I think, from memory, before the SAS was sent in. I think the  circumstances were a bit different, weren’t they?

TONY ABBOTT:

There was very strong resolve shown by the Howard Government and there is no stronger way of showing  your resolve than dealing with an issue such as the Tampa with the SAS.

QUESTION:

Doesn’t this point to the policy that you propose to turn boats back to the difficulty and complexity of that  policy; that it’s not a simple policy?

TONY ABBOTT:

The important thing is to make it absolutely crystal clear that the Australian Government is in charge of who  comes to our country. The tragedy of Australia’s situation over the last four years is that the people  smugglers have been in charge of who comes to our country. Under John Howard, the Government was in  charge. Under Julia Gillard, the people smugglers are in charge.

QUESTION:

These people are now on Christmas Island, so what has happened has happened. What do you think should  happen to them, to those who are allegedly, the ring leaders of alleged piracy? Should they be prosecuted or  are you happy for them now to be processed through the system?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, at the very least, this matter should be thoroughly investigated and it should be thoroughly  investigated by the police. Intimidating the captain of a ship is no light matter. It is unlawful to intimidate  the captain of a ship. On the basis of what we were told by Minister Clare today, an unlawful act has  occurred at sea and that should be dealt with by the police. As I said, the difference is John Howard met the  Tampa with the SAS. Julia Gillard met the Parsifal with a welcoming committee.

QUESTION:

Would you have sent the SAS into the Parsifal - a vessel that was 44 nautical miles away from Indonesia at  the time?

TONY ABBOTT:

What we would never do is allow the people smugglers to run our immigration policy and that’s effectively  what’s happened under this government. Now, we would use all the options that are available to the  Australian Government to ensure that we are in charge of who comes to our country, not the people  smugglers.

QUESTION:

If you were Prime Minister today, you said John Howard would’ve, would you have sent the SAS onto this  boat today?

TONY ABBOTT:

As Minister Clare made crystal clear this morning, the Government was fully aware that the Captain of the  Parsifal had been intimidated by boat people into turning his ship around. Now, this is an unlawful act and  people who come to this country through intimidation should at the very least have been met by the police,  not by a welcoming committee from the Department of Immigration.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, the government you were a part of turned the Tampa around because people had forced that  Captain to try to bring them to Australia. Nobody was ever charged with piracy, the Captain wasn’t charged.  How can you argue that this government should have these people arrested, effectively, and pursue them for  piracy, when your government never did?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, the point I make is that John Howard made it crystal clear who was in charge. He made it absolutely  crystal clear that boat people were not going to get the result they wanted and that’s how he stopped the  boats. Unfortunately, under this government, for four years boat people have got exactly what they wanted  and that’s why the boats have just kept coming and coming and coming.

QUESTION:

Why didn’t your government, though, have them charged with piracy?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, the fact is the illegal arrivals did not get what they wanted.

QUESTION:

Most of them came to Australia, Mr Abbott. Most of them ended up in Australia.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, that’s not correct. That’s not correct. If I may say so, Karen, you’re peddling one of the untruths which  the Government likes to peddle in the Parliament and elsewhere, but well under 50 per cent of the people  who went to Nauru and Manus Island ended up in Australia, 30 per cent of them went home, some 30 per  cent went to a country other than Australia and about 40 per cent ultimately came to Australia often after a  very, very long wait and the great thing about all that is that it did stop the boats.

QUESTION:

But there was no penalty for the people who were on board the Tampa for their behaviour, was there?

TONY ABBOTT:

The point I want to make is that the Howard Government made it crystal clear who was in charge. The  Australian Government was in charge of our borders. Unfortunately, under the Gillard Government, the  people smugglers have been in charge of our borders.

QUESTION:

[Inaudible] the people smugglers peddle information to the asylum seekers in Indonesia and elsewhere, are  you worried that your rhetoric about the lack of government control in this area is actually fuelling a surge  right now?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, what I’ve been saying over the last few days is that the Government has finally done something right.  It has started the process of reopening Nauru and Manus Island and that’s one out of the three necessary  ingredients if we are to stop the boats. So, I’ve given credit where it’s due, but if we are serious about  stopping the boats, there are two other essential steps that this government needs to take.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, on a non-boat related question, do you fully support Isobel Redmond as a South Australian  Liberal leader and are you concerned by the current leadership turmoil in the party in South Australia?

TONY ABBOTT:

I’m looking forward to going to Adelaide on the weekend. I am looking forward to addressing the South  Australian State Council of the Liberal Party and I’m looking forward to giving the leader my full support.

QUESTION:

Can I just ask a question on another topic? Are you concerned or otherwise about the reports out of London  this morning regarding Julian Assange and reports that police are moving in on the Ecuadorian embassy?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, I think that Julian Assange should be given exactly the same assistance that would be given to any  other Australian citizen in trouble; no more and no less.

QUESTION:

Are you concerned that the Gillard Government lacks sufficient conviction to make offshore processing in  PNG and Nauru actually work?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, this is the test which the Government has now set for itself. It’s one thing to pass legislation through  the Parliament, which is effectively the Coalition’s legislation; it’s another thing to put it effectively into  practice. That’s the challenge for this government now and the point I keep making is that if you want John  Howard’s results, you’ve got to have John Howard’s resolve and my fear with this government is that its  heart is just not in it. I’ve said for a long time now that if you want to stop the boats, almost certainly you  will have to change the Government, because what the current government has demonstrated time and time  again is that when it comes to stopping the boats, their heart’s just not in it. They don’t have it in themselves  to do what’s necessary to make this happen.

QUESTION:

So, they can’t do the job?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think that if you look at this government’s performance on a whole range of issues, but particularly on the  border protection issue, people think that it’s not only untrustworthy but incompetent.

QUESTION:

The Prime Minister’s manufacturing taskforce has brought down its report today. You’ve mentioned the  carbon tax earlier, but what things can be done to fix manufacturing, apart from carbon tax?

TONY ABBOTT:

But this is the one obvious thing which is wholly within the responsibility of the Commonwealth  Government to change; that they could do that would fix manufacturing. I’ve been to factory after factory,  workshop after workshop, business after business, over the last 12 months and the message that I get  constantly is that they don’t want to be competing against the rest of the world with this additional cost  burden and to give you…

QUESTION:

Apart from axing the carbon tax what could you do as a government?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, that would be the single most dramatic thing that the Government could do if it’s fair dinkum about  restoring Australian manufacturing’s competitiveness.

QUESTION:

Just yesterday the Opposition was quiet yesterday on the High Court decision on tobacco. Do you welcome  that decision and why was there no comment?

TONY ABBOTT:

We supported the legislation and, look, it says something about this government that they were so keen to  celebrate the fact that they didn’t get defeated in the High Court.
