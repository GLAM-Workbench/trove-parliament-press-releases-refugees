The Hon Stephen Smith MP  AUSTRALIAN MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS

Media Release

8 June, 2009

Ambassador for People Smuggling Issues  Mr Peter Woolcott will be Australia's new Ambassador for People Smuggling Issues.

The appointment, to take effect this week, underlines the Government's strong commitment  to regional cooperation to combat people smuggling, human trafficking and related  transnational crime.

The Ambassador for People Smuggling Issues is responsible for high-level advocacy of  Australia's interests in promoting effective and practical regional and international  cooperation to combat these crimes, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region.

Mr Woolcott succeeds Mr Michael Potts, who has been Ambassador since January 2007.

The Government decided in this year's Budget to establish the Ambassador for People  Smuggling Issues as a dedicated full time position.

This was done in recognition of the significant challenges that Australia is facing as a result  of difficult conditions in source locations such as Afghanistan, the Afghanistan-Pakistan  border area and Sri Lanka.

Mr Woolcott will help effect a coordinated, whole-of-government approach to Australia's  engagement with the Bali Process on People Smuggling, Trafficking in Persons and Related  Transnational Crime, which Australia co-chairs with Indonesia.

The Ambassador will work with countries in the region to utilise the Bali Process Ad Hoc  Group mechanism to address regional people smuggling situations.

This was one of the positive outcomes of the recent Bali Process ministerial meeting in Bali  on 14-15 April 2009, which I jointly chaired with Indonesian Foreign Minister, Dr Hassan  Wirajuda.

Mr Woolcott will work closely with other governments, the UN High Commissioner for  Refugees and the International Organization for Migration, to take forward practical Bali  Process measures, including regional and international cooperation between key operational

agencies.
