TEMPORARY RELOCATION ARRANGEMENTS PAUSED

Â

This morning Australian time the United Nations High Commissioner 
for Refugees, Madam Ogata, has called fo r a pause in the temporary 
relocation of displaced Kosovo Albanians.

Â

After initially requesting Australia’s involvement 
in international assistance measures, Madam Ogata has indicated a need 
to re-evaluate the humanitarian effort after arriving in the region.

Â

Australia will take heed of this call and hold all 
removal arrangements, but will maintain its readiness to participate 
in any international effort to relocate Kosovo Albanians.

Â

Department of Immigration staff will continue to the 
Former Yugoslavia Republic of Macedonia to continue to finalise preparations.

Â

I would expect Australia would be in a position to 
move people within 48 hours of the lifting of such a pause.
