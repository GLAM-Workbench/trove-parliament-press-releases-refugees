From the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, the Hon. M.J.R. MacKellar, M.P. 10 November 1979

REFUGEE BOAT SIGHTED

The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Mr

MacKellar,  said today that he was concerned that people fleeÂ­

ing from Vietnam should continue to attempt the long and

perilous voyage to Australia in small unseaworthy boats.

Mr MacKellar was commenting on the interception of

two refugee vessels north west of Broome by the Department of

Transport vessel "Cape Pilar". Â·

The vessels which are reported to have about fifty

people on board are expected to arrive in Broome at 18.30

hours ESST today. j Ã¢ÂÂ

Mr MacKellar stated that the whole Australian

Indo-Chinese refugee program would be placed in jeopardy if

refugees continued to arrive in such a manner. Apart from

"  the enormous risks involved in such a perilous journey it

was unfair to those in refugee camps who were prepared to

wait for orderly processing.

Mr MacKellar added that there were sufficient

resettlement places available to ensure that all refugees

leaving Vietnam would resettled in a reasonable time.

Mr MacKellar said that in accordance with

Australia's strict quarantine and health procedures the group

would be held for detailed checking and interview before a

decision could be taken on their future.
