DEMOCRATS  MEDIA 04/861 MONDAY 6 SEPTEMBER 2004   SENATOR NATASHA STOTT DESPOJA SENATOR FOR SOUTH AUSTRALIA FIRST TIME VOTER'S KIT LAUNCHED The Australian Democrats today urged first time voters across the country to have their say at the ballot box by enrolling to vote before the rolls close tomorrow. Launching the Democrats’ First Time Voters’ Kit in Adelaide today, Senator for South Australia Natasha Stott Despoja said first time voters would play a key role in the outcome of the upcoming Federal election. "There are about 80,000 young South Australians who will be eligible to vote for the first time on October 9,” Senator Stott Despoja said. “The aim of our First Time Voters’ Kit is twofold. It aims to both encourage young voters to enrol to vote, and help to demystify our electoral system.” The kit contains an Electoral Enrolment form, an explanation of our preferential voting system, and some information on Democrat policies. “Young people are a powerful political force and it is important they know how the electoral system works and how they can ensure their vote reflects their voting intentions,” Senator Stott Despoja said. “Every vote is important and votes are never wasted if cast correctly. Marginal seats in particular are often decided by only a handful of votes.” Senator Stott Despoja will be joined at today’s launch by former Sudanese refugee, Mr Peter Agalla, a first time voter in this election. “It is important that all citizens vote so they can help decide who will govern our country for the next three years,” Mr Agalla said. “Many people may not realise they only have till tomorrow night to ensure they are on the electoral roll,” Senator Stott Despoja said. The First Time Voter’s Kit will be distributed by Democrat candidates.   Media Contact - Kate Griffith - 0417 085 260
