ADDRESS BY

THE MINSTER FOR TRADE AND OVERSEAS DEVELOPMENT

THE HON NEAL BLEWETT MR

TO THE NATIONAL CONFERENCE

OF THE UNITED NATIONS ASSOCIATION OF AUSTRALIA

ON

DOING BUSINESS WITH THE UNITED NATIONS

CANBERRA, 13 SEPTEMBER 1991

iMONVVEALTH

T H IS  IS  THE ERA OF DOING BUSINESS. MR GORBACHEV IN  THE KREMLIN

AND MR YELTSIN IN  RUSSIA ARE INCREASINGLY ASKING US TO DO

BUSINESS WITH THEM. GOVERNMENTS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, ONCE

ENTRANCED BY CENTRAL PLANNING, ARE DISCOVERING THE NEED TO DO

BUSINESS. SO I T 'S  NOT ODD THAT WE ARE TALKING HERE ABOUT DOING

BUSINESS WITH THE UNITED NATIONS.

OUR PRIVATE SECTOR HAS FOR TOO LONG SEEN THE UNITED NATIONS AND

IT S  AGENCIES AS ORGANISATIONS HAVING L IT T L E  TO DO WITH

BUSINESS. TH IS  IS  A SHORT-SIGHTED VIEW . BUSINESS, L IK E

GOVERNMENT W ILL INCREASINGLY BE AFFECTED BY A NEW AGENDA OF

TRANS-NATIONAL ISSUES, SUCH AS THE SPREAD OF DISEASES,

POPULATION FLOWS AND THE PROTECTION OF THE ENVIRONMENT. MANY

OF THESE PROBLEMS W ILL BE ADDRESSED IN  THE UNITED NATIONS

SYSTEM, AND THE RESULT IS  LIK E LY  TO BE TIGHTER AND MORE COMPLEX

REGULATION OF A SERIES OF AREAS OF INTEREST TO BUSINESS. THE

ENVIRONMENT IS  THE CLEAREST EXAMPLE OF T H IS , AND I  WOULD DRAW

THE ATTENTION OF THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY TO NEXT YEAR’ S MEETING

OF THE UNITED NATIONS CONFERENCE ON THE ENVIRONMENT AND

DEVELOPMENT. GOVERNMENTS AND BUSINESS W ILL  BE PAYING MORE, NOT

LESS ATTENTION TO THE UNITED NATIONS SYSTEM IN  THE COMING YEARS.

BUT I  WANT TO NARROW MY FOCUS IN  TODAY'S ADDRESS, AND DEAL WITH

MATTERS OF MORE IMMEDIATE INTEREST TO THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY -

THE WAY IN  WHICH THE PRIVATE SECTOR CAN PROFIT FROM DEALING

WITH THE UNITED NATIONS AND THE MULTILATERAL SYSTEM WHILE

HELPING AU STR ALIA'S OVERSEAS DEVELOPMENT EFFORT. AND I F  THAT

SOUNDS LIK E  THE PROVERBIAL SNAKE O IL  PANACEA AT A SUSPICIOUSLY

CHEAP PRICE, I T  IS N ’ T .

2 .

THE THEORY IS  SIM PLE. MUCH OF A U S T R A L IA 'S  OVERSEAS DEVELOPMENT

EFFORT IS  CHANNELLED THROUGH THE UNITED NATIONS AND THE

DEVELOPMENT BANKS. THESE IN S T IT U T IO N S  REPRESENT AN ENORMOUS

MARKET FOR GOODS AND SERVICES WHICH COULD BE BETTER TAPPED BY

AUSTRALIAN BUSINESS. AT THE SAME T IM E , AUSTRALIAN COMPANIES

HAVE EXPERTISE, IN  SOME CASES UNIQUE, WHICH SHOULD BE OFFERED

THROUGH THE INTERNATIONAL SYSTEM TO DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. AND

I F  THE AUSTRALIAN BUSINESS SECTOR PROFITS FROM DEVELOPMENT

A C T IV IT IE S , THE AUSTRALIAN COMMUNITY IN  GENERAL WOULD GAIN A

BETTER APPRECIATION OF DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE AS THE MUTUALLY

PROFITABLE A C T IV IT Y  THAT I T  I S .  THAT WOULD TRANSLATE INTO

GREATER SUPPORT FOR THE DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE BUDGET.

AFTER A L L , THE UNITED NATIONS AGENCIES AND DEVELOPMENT BANKS

DON'T PLUCK ALL THE GOODS AND SERVICES THAT THEY USE OFF SOME

BOUNTIFUL TREE. EVERY ITEM THAT THESE AGENCIES USE AND

D ISTR IBU TE HAS TO BE PAID FOR BY SOMEONE. EVEN MORE IMPORTANT,

THEY HAVE TO BUY ALL THOSE GOODS AND SERVICES, VALUED AT MORE

THAN $ 30 B IL L IO N  A YEAR, FROM SOMEWHERE. GIVEN THE RANGE OF

THESE ORGANISATIONS' A C T IV IT IE S , THERE IS  A LARGE INTERNATIONAL

MARKET FOR A VARIETY OF MANUFACTURED PRODUCTS AND CONSULTANCY

SERVICES.

SINCE ASSUMING R ESPO N SIBILITY FOR THE TRADE AND OVERSEAS

DEVELOPMENT PORTFOLIO, ONE OF MY MAJOR OBJECTIVES HAS BEEN TO

ENCOURAGE THE AUSTRALIAN COMMUNITY IN  GENERAL AND THE BUSINESS

COMMUNITY IN  PARTICULAR TO SEE THE LINKAGES BETWEEN TRADE AND

OVERSEAS DEVELOPMENT. IN  THE CASE OF BILATERAL A ID , THE LIN KS

3 .

ARE CLEAR -  OUR DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE I S  SPENT LARGELY ON

AUSTRALIAN GOODS AND SERVICES THAT CAN HELP DEVELOPING

COUNTRIES. BUT, IN  MY EXPERIENCE, EXPORTERS THINK TOO OFTEN OF

AUSTRALIAN DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE ONLY AS BILATERAL A ID .

THEY FORGET NOT ONLY THE ENORMOUS MULTILATERAL DEVELOPMENT

EFFORT MOUNTED BY THE UNITED NATIONS AND THE INTERNATIO NAL

FIN A N C IA L IN S T IT U T IO N S , BUT THE SUBSTANTIAL AUSTRALIAN

CONTRIBUTION TO THAT EFFORT. IN  FACT, THE MARKET FOR

AUSTRALIAN FIRMS TO SUPPLY INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATIONS IS

CONSIDERABLY LARGER THAN THAT OFFERED BY THE AUSTRALIAN

BILATERAL A ID  PROGRAM.

I  WANT TO ENCOURAGE AUSTRALIAN BUSINESS TO PURSUE THE BUSINESS

OPPORTUNITIES W ITHIN THESE MULTILATERAL ORGANISATIONS. OF

COURSE, I  WANT TO SEE THE PROFITS OF AUSTRALIAN BUSINESSES

INCREASE. BUT I  BELIEVE, TOO, THAT THE SALE OF AUSTRALIAN

GOODS AND SERVICES TO INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATIONS W ILL

COMPLEMENT OUR SUPPORT OF THESE AGENCIES. IN  GENERAL, TRADE

AND OVERSEAS DEVELOPMENT ARE MUTUALLY SUPPORTING. ECONOMIC

DEVELOPMENT INCREASES THE FLOW OF TRADE AND INCREASED TRADE

ASSISTS ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. GREATER AND MORE DIVERSE TRADE

IS  IN  THE INTEREST OF A LL, AND THE AUSTRALIAN PRIVATE SECTOR

CAN MAKE A CONTRIBUTION TO IT S E L F  AND TO THIRD WORLD

DEVELOPMENT BY ASSISTING THOSE TRADE FLOWS.

4 .

OF COURSE, THE GENERAL REASONS FOR OUR F IN A N C IA L AND POLICY

SUPPORT FOR UNITED NATIONS ORGANISATIONS AND THE DEVELOPMENT

BANKS ARE THE SAME AS THOSE FOR OUR OVERALL DEVELOPMENT

ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN  THE POOREST

REGIONS OF THE WORLD I S  IN  OUR OWN SELF INTEREST IN  THAT I T

HELPS TO CREATE A MORE PROSPEROUS AND SECURE WORLD. I T  IS  AN

EXPRESSION OF THE HUMANITARIAN IMPULSE WHICH OUR SOCIETY

EXPECTS OF ITS E LF AND IT S  GOVERNMENT. AND I T  GIVES US ADDED

INFLUENCE IN  REGIONS OF IMPORTANCE TO US.

BUT AUSTRALIA SUPPORTS THESE AGENCIES TO THE EXTENT THAT I T

DOES BECAUSE OF THE PARTICULAR CONCERN THAT ALL OUR A ID  FUNDS

BE USED IN  THE BEST POSSIBLE WAY. AND THE FACT IS  THAT THE

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ORGANISATIONS CAN UNDERTAKE

DEVELOPMENT A C T IV IT IE S  ON A SCALE THAT MIGHT NOT BE POSSIBLE

FOR AUSTRALIA AS A SINGLE DONOR. OUR FUNDS CAN BE AND ARE

DIRECTED THROUGH THE MULTILATERAL SYSTEM TO S P E C IF IC  AREAS,

SUCH AS THE WELFARE OF CHILDREN, WOMEN AND THE POOR IN

DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. WE HAVE INCREASED OUR CONTRIBUTION TO

THE AGENCIES DEALING WITH THE EFFECTS OF RAPID POPULATION

GROWTH, SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND THE ENVIRONMENT.

AT THE SAME TIM E , INVOLVEMENT IN  THE A C T IV IT IE S  OF THE

MULTILATERAL AGENCIES MEANS THAT WE CAN UNDERTAKE COMPLEMENTARY

BILATERAL PROGRAMS THAT BENEFIT R EC IPIEN T COUNTRIES AND

AUSTRALIAN BUSINESS. WE NEED ALSO TO HAVE SOME INFLUENCE ON

THE A C T IV IT IE S  OF THESE IN S T IT U T IO N S , WHICH CAN PLAY A MAJOR

FOREIGN POLICY ROLE IN  AREAS OF IMPORTANCE TO US.

5 .

AND, ALTHOUGH I T  MIGHT NOT BE A REASON FOR A U S TR A LIA ’ S SUPPORT

FOR THESE MULTILATERAL IN S T IT U T IO N S , OUR INVOLVEMENT DOES GIVE

AUSTRALIAN COMPANIES MORE CHANCES FOR BUSINESS THAN THEY WOULD

FIND IN  THE BILATERAL PROGRAM ALONE. THE KEY I S  FOR AUSTRALIAN

BUSINESS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THESE OPPORTUNITIES.

OUR CORE BUDGET SUPPORT FOR THESE MULTILATERAL IN S T IT U T IO N S  WAS

WORTH OVER $ 3 0 0  M ILLIO N  LAST FIN A N C IA L YEAR. MUCH THE LARGER

PART OF THAT WAS PAID FROM THE A ID  BUDGET TO THE UNITED NATIONS

DEVELOPMENT AGENCIES AND THE DEVELOPMENT BANKS. THE REMAINDER

-  ABOUT $5 0  M IL L IO N  -  CAME FROM A FEW GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS,

CHIEFLY THE DEPARTMENT OF FOREIGN AFFAIR S AND TRADE, TO THE

REGULAR BUDGETS OF THE UNITED NATIONS AND IT S  SPECIALISED

AGENCIES.

OUR SUPPORT FOR THE UNITED NATIONS DEVELOPMENT AGENCIES AND THE

DEVELOPMENT BANKS WAS APPROXIMATELY 22 PERCENT OF OUR O F F IC IA L

DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE BUDGET OF $ 1 .2 6  B IL L IO N . T H IS  IS  A

S IG N IF IC A N T  AMOUNT FOR AUSTRALIA, BUT, AS I  HAVE S A ID , SMALL

WHEN COMPARED TO THE TOTAL EXPENDITURE ON GOODS AND SERVICES OF

MORE THAN $3 0  B IL L IO N  BY THESE ORGANISATIONS. MOST OF TH IS  IS

SPENT BY THE BANKS, AND A COMPARATIVELY SMALL AMOUNT BY THE

UNITED NATIONS AGENCIES.

THE TOTAL VALUE OF AUSTRALIAN GOODS AND SERVICES SUPPLIED TO

THE UNITED NATIONS SYSTEM AND THE BANKS VARIES GREATLY FROM

YEAR TO YEAR. SOME PROCUREMENT COMES FROM THE FOOD COMMODITIES

PURCHASED FROM AUSTRALIAN FARMERS WHICH WE PROVIDE TO THE WORLD

FOOD PROGRAM EACH YEAR AS PART OF OUR $ 4 5  M IL L IO N  OF

6 .

ASSISTANCE. IN  1 9 8 9 , UNITED NATION AGENCIES PURCHASED MORE

THAN $ 4  M IL L IO N  WORTH OF EQUIPMENT FROM AUSTRALIA, A

DISAPPO IN TIN G LY SMALL AMOUNT. WE DO BETTER WITH THE SUPPLY OF

SERVICES TO THESE ORGANISATIONS, SELLIN G  ABOUT $2 2  M ILLIO N

ANNUALLY.

THE DIRECT BENEFITS TO AUSTRALIAN BUSINESS FROM UNITED NATIONS

PROCUREMENT ARE EASY TO RECOUNT. BUT THE IN D IR EC T BENEFITS TO

AUSTRALIAN FIRMS FROM SUPPLYING GOODS AND SERVICES TO THE

DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM ARE JUST AS IMPORTANT. I T  GIVES AUSTRALIAN

COMPANIES THE OPPORTUNITY TO ESTABLISH A REPUTATION AS A USEFUL

SUPPLIER TO UNITED NATIONS AGENCIES AND THE DEVELOPMENT BANKS.

FIRMS MAY THEN FIND I T  EASIER TO WIN OTHER SUPPLY CONTRACTS,

WHETHER A ID  RELATED OR COMMERCIALLY, IN  THE FUTURE. IN

AUSTRALIA WE ARE REMOVED FROM THE DECISIO N-M AKING  CENTRES OF

THE INTERNATIONAL AGENCIES AND FROM SOME OF THEIR AREAS OF

OPERATION IN  THE DEVELOPING WORLD. WE TEND TO UNDERVALUE THE

ENORMOUS AND COMMERCIALLY VALUABLE CACHET THAT COMES FROM BEING

AN ACCEPTED SUPPLIER TO THESE AGENCIES, PARTICULARLY IN

DEVELOPING COUNTRIES.

THESE AGENCIES' A C T IV IT IE S  CAN INTRODUCE AUSTRALIAN GOODS AND

SERVICES TO THE DOMESTIC MARKETS OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. WE

SHOULD NOT UNDERESTIMATE THE IMPORTANCE OF THOSE MARKETS. THEY

CAN BE HARD MARKETS, REQUIRING THE INVESTMENT OF TIM E AND

RESOURCES. BUT THEY ARE INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT TO US.

7 .

OUR EXPORTS TO DEVELOPING COUNTRIES WERE WORTH MORE THAN

$ 1 9  B IL L IO N  LAST FIN A N C IA L YEAR. OUR EXPORTS TO THE DEVELOPING

COUNTRIES IN  OUR REGION HAVE BEEN R IS IN G  OVER THE LAST DECADE

WITH INCREASED ECONOMIC GROWTH IN  THOSE COUNTRIES. BY

PROMOTING GROWTH IN  DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, THROUGH OUR BILATERAL

A ID  PROGRAM AND OUR PAR TIC IPA TIO N  IN  THE WORK OF THE

MULTILATERAL AGENCIES, WE HELP CREATE FUTURE TRADE

OPPORTUNITIES. GOOD A ID  CAN BE GOOD TRADE.

GIVEN THESE BENEFITS, I T  IS  DISAPPO INTING  THAT AUSTRALIAN FIRMS

DO NOT HAVE A GREATER SHARE OF THE BUSINESS THAT THE UNITED

NATIONS AND THE BANKS DO. THE RECORD ON PROCUREMENT IS

UNEVEN. WITH SOME AGENCIES, PROCUREMENT FROM AUSTRALIA EXCEEDS

OUR CONTRIBUTIONS. BUT, WITH OUR POSITION IN  THE WORLD ECONOMY

AND OUR PROXIMITY TO ASIAN AND P A C IF IC  MARKETS, THAT SHARE

COULD BE HIGHER.

OUR LEVEL OF CONTRIBUTION TO PARTICULAR UN AGENCIES RANKS US

BETWEEN TENTH AND FIFTEENTH AMONG DONORS. NEVERTHELESS, WITH A

TOTAL SHARE OF ABOUT 0 . 6  PERCENT OF TOTAL PROCUREMENT,

AUSTRALIA RANKS ONLY TWENTYSIXTH AS A PROVIDER OF GOODS AND

SERVICES. THE SAME PATTERN MAY BE SEEN WITH THE DEVELOPMENT

BANKS. AUSTRALIA IS  THE NINTH LARGEST DEVELOPED COUNTRY DONOR

TO THE WORLD BANK, BUT IS  RANKED ONLY TWELFTH IN  TERMS OF

PROCUREMENT.

8 .

I  DON'T WANT TO TAKE A MECHANISTIC AND UNDULY MERCENARY VIEW OF

T H IS  S IT U A T IO N , TO SAY THAT AUSTRALIA SHOULD GET AS MUCH OUT OF

THE INTERNATIONAL PROCUREMENT SYSTEM AS I T  PUTS INTO THE

AGENCIES. INDEED, I  WOULD BE VERY HAPPY I F  AUSTRALIAN FIRMS

MANAGED TO WIN MORE THAN THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT'S

CONTRIBUTION! BUT WE GIVE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE

FOR A RANGE OF REASONS, AND COMMERCIAL INTERESTS ARE ONLY ONE,

AND NOT THE P R IN C IP A L , OF THOSE. I  AM MORE CONCERNED WITH WHAT

THESE FIGURES HAVE TO SAY ABOUT THE EXISTENCE OF IMPORTANT

MARKETS WHICH ARE NOT BEING TAPPED BY AUSTRALIAN BUSINESS, FOR

ONE REASON OR ANOTHER. INTERNATIONAL PROCUREMENT I S ,  WHEN YOU

COME DOWN TO I T ,  ANOTHER EXPORT MARKET. WE NEED TO IMPROVE OUR

SHARE OF ALL AVAILABLE EXPORT MARKETS -  ALL THE MORE SO I F ,  AS

IN  T H IS  CASE, AUSTRALIAN BUSINESS SUCCESS CAN HELP OUR BROADER

DEVELOPMENT EFFORT.

WHEN WE LOOK AT THE S P E C IFIC  ESTIMATES OF A U S T R A LIA 'S

PERFORMANCE WITH THE VARIOUS ORGANISATIONS, WE SEE JUST HOW

UNEVEN THE RECORD I S .  THE SUPPLY OF AUSTRALIAN GOODS AND

SERVICES TO THE UNITED NATIONS DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME AND THE

WORLD BANK IS  USUALLY WORTH MORE THAN A U S T R A LIA 'S  CONTRIBUTION

TO THOSE ORGANISATIONS. PROCUREMENT BY THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT

BANK FROM AUSTRALIAN SOURCES IS  WORTH ALMOST AS MUCH AS

A U S T R A LIA 'S  CONTRIBUTION. PROCUREMENT BY THE WORLD FOOD

PROGRAMME IS  VALUED AT SOME 75 PERCENT OF A U S T R A LIA 'S

CONTRIBUTION. THESE FOUR ORGANISATIONS ACCOUNT FOR ABOUT

THREE-QUARTERS OF A U S TR A LIA 'S  CONTRIBUTION TO MULTILATERAL

ORGANISATIONS.

9 .

PROCUREMENT FOR SOME ORGANISATIONS, SUCH AS UNICEF, HAS VARIED

GREATLY. FOR OTHERS, AUSTRALIAN BUSINESS HAS PROVIDED

VIR TU ALLY NO GOODS AND SERVICES. SOME OF THESE, I  SHOULD POINT

OUT, CANNOT IMPLEMENT A C T IV IT IE S  IN  THEIR OWN RIGHT AND ARE NOT

THE GOLD-MINE THEY MIGHT SEEM. FOR EXAMPLE, THE UNITED NATIONS

ENVIRONMENT PROGRAMME HAD A TOTAL PROCUREMENT OF ONLY ABOUT

$ 3  M IL L IO N  IN  1 9 8 9 .

THERE ARE SUCCESS STORIES THAT SHOW WHAT AUSTRALIAN COMPANIES

CAN DO WHEN THEY FOCUS ON THE MARKETS OFFERED BY INTERNATIONAL

PROCUREMENT. DYNEK, AN ADELAIDE COMPANY, BEGAN SUPPLYING

SURGICAL SUTURES TO THE UNITED NATIONS SYSTEM TWO YEARS AGO.

I T  HAS B U IL T  ON IT S  IN IT IA L  SUCCESS BY INCREASING IT S  EXPORTS

EXTENSIVELY WHILE M AINTAINING AND EXPANDING IT S  SHARE OF THE

DOMESTIC MARKET. CODAN, ANOTHER SOUTH AUSTRALIAN FIRM ,

SUPPLIES ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT IN  A HIGHLY

COMPETITIVE MARKET TO VARIOUS UNITED NATIONS AGENCIES. AS A

RESULT OF IT S  EXPOSURE THROUGH A ID  PROJECTS, I T  HAS SET UP AN

AGENCY IN  ANGOLA. TYRES PRODUCED BY DUNLOP P A C IF IC  ARE USED IN

EAST AFR IC A. THEIR RELATIVELY HIGH COST IS  OUTWEIGHED BY THEIR

LONGEVITY, TESTED IN  OUTBACK CONDITIONS.

I  EMPHASIZE THAT THESE ARE EXAMPLES ONLY -  I  COULD MENTION

OTHERS, SUCH AS THE SUPPLY OF WINDMILLS TO MOROCCO AND VITAM IN

A CAPSULES TO IN D IA . WHAT THESE EXAMPLES HAVE IN  COMMON IS  AN

AWARENESS OF THE MARKET OPPORTUNITIES IN  INTERNATIONAL

PROCUREMENT AND A WILLINGNESS TO WORK AT THOSE OPPORTUNITIES.

10.

THEY ALSO SHOW HOW AUSTRALIAN PRODUCTS CAN PLAY AN HONOURABLE

WHILE PROFITABLE PART IN  THE DEVELOPMENT EFFORT. DYNEK'S

SUTURES ARE USED IN  VACCINATION PROGRAMS, SAVING THE LIV E S  OF

CHILDREN IN  DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. CODAN'S COMMUNICATIONS

EQUIPMENT ALLOWS THE UNITED NATIONS AGENCIES TO DELIVER THEIR

SERVICES QUICKLY AND E F F IC IE N T LY . THE V ITA M IN  A CAPSULES USED

IN  IN D IA  HAVE SAVED THE SIGHT OF PEOPLE WHO WOULD OTHERWISE

HAVE LOST I T  THROUGH SIMPLE V IT A M IN  DEFICIENCY.

I  D O N 'T PRETEND THAT INTERNATIONAL PROCUREMENT IS  AN EASY

MARKET. EACH MULTILATERAL ORGANISATION HAS IT S  OWN PROCUREMENT

SERVICE WITH DIFFERENT APPROACHES. BUT THE FUNDAMENTAL

PR IN C IP LE  COMMON TO ALL IS  THE PROCUREMENT OF GOODS AND

SERVICES AT THE LOWEST POSSIBLE COST -  W ITH, UNDERSTANDABLY,

SOME PREFERENCE IN  FAVOUR OF DEVELOPING COUNTRY SUPPLIERS.

DEVELOPING COUNTRIES MEET ABOUT ONE-THIRD OF THE PROCUREMENT OF

THE DEVELOPMENT BANKS.

S T IL L , THE UNITED NATIONS IS  AWARE OF THE D IF F IC U L T IE S  THAT

FIRMS RIGHT ACROSS THE WORLD EXPERIENCE IN  BIDDING  FOR

PROCUREMENT CONTRACTS. THE UN HAS CREATED AN INTER-AGENCY

PROCUREMENT SERVICES OFFICE TO SERVE AS A SOURCE OF ADVICE AND

GUIDANCE FOR POTENTIAL SUPPLIERS, PARTICULARLY IN  DEVELOPING

COUNTRIES AND UNDER-UTILISED DONOR COUNTRIES. THE OFFICE

PUBLISHES A GENERAL BUSINESS GUIDE EXPLAINING HOW THE UNITED

NATIONS PROCUREMENT PROCESS WORKS. T H IS  GUIDE WOULD BE A

USEFUL FIRST STEP FOR AUSTRALIAN FIRMS WHICH HAVE NOT LOOKED

SERIOUSLY AT DOING BUSINESS WITH THE UNITED NATIONS. OTHER

11.

PUBLICATIONS PRODUCED BY THE UNITED NATIONS AND THE DEVELOPMENT

BANKS PROVIDE MORE DETAILED INFORMATION ON OPPORTUNITIES. AND

TWO UNITED NATIONS AGENCIES -  UNICEF AND THE UNITED NATIONS

HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR REFUGEES -  HAVE OFFICES IN  AUSTRALIA THAT

CAN ASS IS T WITH PROCUREMENT FROM AUSTRALIAN FIRM S.

THE UNITED NATIONS HAS BEEN ATTEMPTING TO MAKE I T  LESS

D IF F IC U L T  FOR FIRMS TO PARTICIPATE IN  THE PROCUREMENT PROCESS.

BUT I T  REMAINS A COMPLEX A FF A IR , PARTICULARLY FOR THE

AUSTRALIAN ENTREPRENEUR CONFRONTED WITH DIFFERENT BUSINESS

PRACTISES AND PROCEDURES, LANGUAGE AND CULTURAL BARRIERS, AND

UNFAMILIAR SPEC IFICATIO NS FOR GOODS AND SERVICES. A U S TR A LIA 'S

ISO LATIO N  FROM THE DECISION MAKING CENTRES OF THE UNITED

NATIONS AND THE DEVELOPMENT BANKS IN  NORTH AMERICA AND EUROPE

MEANS THAT OFTEN WE DO NOT BECOME AWARE OF OPPORTUNITIES AS

QUICKLY AS OTHER DONOR COUNTRIES.

NEVERTHELESS, THE COMPETITIVE INTERNATIONAL BID D IN G  USED BY

INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATIONS DOES GIVE SUPPLIERS WORLD-WIDE,

INCLUDING IN  AUSTRALIA, THE CHANCE TO COMPETE. GIVEN THE

CONCERN OF PROCUREMENT OFFICERS TO MATCH GOODS AND SERVICES TO

CONDITIONS IN  DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, AUSTRALIAN TECHNOLOGIES FOR

TROPICAL, SUB-TROPICAL AND DRY LAND AGRICULTURE SHOULD BE WELL

PLACED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE BIDDING SYSTEM.

12.

I  AM INTERESTED IN  LOOKING AT WAYS TO HELP AUSTRALIAN

BUSINESSES COMPETE FOR THE SUPPLY OF GOODS AND SERVICES TO

THESE ORGANISATIONS. I  HAVE INSTRUCTED THE VARIOUS AREAS OF MY

PORTFOLIO -  AID AB AND THE DEPARTMENT OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND

TRADE -  TO EXAMINE AU STR ALIA'S RECENT PROCUREMENT PERFORMANCE.

THE F IR S T  PART OF TH IS  EXERCISE IS  VIRTUALLY COMPLETE AND HAS

PROVIDED THE RATIONALE FOR TH IS SPEECH.

A ID A B 'S  BUSINESS COOPERATION SECTION ALREADY PUBLISHES

INFORMATION ON PROCUREMENT MATTERS. I T  HAS PRODUCED BOOKLETS

ON BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES WITH THE BANKS AND THE UNITED NATIONS

SYSTEM. THESE PROVIDE INFORMATION ON THE POTENTIAL FOR SALES

TO THESE ORGANISATIONS AND DETAILS ON HOW TO OBTAIN MORE

INFORMATION. AIDAB HAS ALSO ORGANISED SEMINARS IN  AUSTRALIA

FOR AUSTRALIAN BUSINESS TO HIGHLIGHT INTERNATIONAL PROCUREMENT

OPPORTUNITIES AND EXPLAIN HOW THE PROCUREMENT PROCESS WORKS.

AUSTRADE, AS PART OF IT S  HELP FOR AUSTRALIAN BUSINESS IN  THE

PROCUREMENT PROCESS, HAS REPRESENTATIVES IN  WASHINGTON AND

MANILA WHO MONITOR PROCUREMENT OPPORTUNITIES FROM THE WORLD

BANK AND THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK.

S T IL L , I  BELIEVE THAT WE CAN DO MORE TO ENCOURAGE AUSTRALIAN

FIRMS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT DO E X IS T . TO

T H IS  END, I  W ILL BE COMMISSIONING A FURTHER STUDY OF HOW WE CAN

IMPROVE OUR PROCUREMENT RESULTS. I  INTEND BEFORE CHRISTMAS TO

ESTABLISH A PORTFOLIO TASKFORCE ON PROCUREMENT FROM THE UN AND

THE INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL IN S T IT U T IO N S . T H IS  TASKFORCE W ILL

INVESTIGATE THE VARIOUS IMPEDIMENTS TO A U S T R A LIA 'S  PROSPECTS IN

PROCUREMENT, AND ALSO RECOMMEND PRACTICAL MEASURES FOR

IMPROVING OUR BUSINESS PERFORMANCE IN  T H IS  MARKET.

13.

ONE EXAMPLE OF HOW GOVERNMENT COULD HELP WOULD BE TO INCREASE

A U S T R A LIA 'S  REPRESENTATION IN  THE MULTILATERAL DEVELOPMENT

BANKS. T H IS  COULD HELP OVERCOME THE ISO LATIO N  FROM THE

DECISIO N-M AKING  CENTRES THAT HANDICAPS AUSTRALIAN COMPANIES.

STRONG REPRESENTATION THROUGH AUSTRALIANS WORKING IN  THESE

ORGANISATIONS COULD IMPROVE THE APPRECIATION OF WHAT AUSTRALIAN

FIRMS CAN OFFER.

IN  ALL THAT I  HAVE S A ID , WE MUST REMEMBER THAT I T  I S  NOT JUST A

MATTER OF SECTIONAL INTEREST THAT AUSTRALIAN FIRMS DO MORE

BUSINESS WITH THE UNITED NATIONS. PROCUREMENT FROM AUSTRALIAN

BUSINESSES COMPLEMENTS THE OBJECTIVES OF THE AUSTRALIAN A ID

PROGRAM, THE STIMULATION OF DEVELOPMENT AND THE R A IS IN G  OF THE

L IV IN G  STANDARDS OF THE POOR IN  DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. I T

REINFORCES THE IMPORTANT LINKS BETWEEN DEVELOPMENT AND TRADE.

I T  MAKES THE PROCUREMENT SYSTEM MORE COMPETITIVE AND E F F IC IE N T ,

AT A TIM E WHEN THE WORLD IS  LOOKING FOR MORE EFFIC IEN CY FROM

MULTILATERAL ORGANISATIONS. I T  IS  PART OF THE IM PERATIVE FOR

AUSTRALIA TO EXPORT OR FALL FURTHER BEHIND.

AUSTRALIAN FIRMS W ILL BE DOING NOT JUST THEMSELVES GOOD WHEN

THEY LOOK CLOSELY AT THE OPPORTUNITIES INTERNATIONAL

ORGANISATIONS PROVIDE. BY TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THOSE

OPPORTUNITIES, THEY W ILL ASSIST THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT'S

EFFORT TO HELP BUILD PROSPERITY AND SECURITY, THE VERY

CONDITIONS IN  WHICH BUSINESS CAN FLOURISH. P O L IT IC A L

S T A B IL IT Y , INCREASED TRADE AND DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE ALL FEED

OFF EACH OTHER, TO THE ULTIMATE BENEFIT OF US A L L . BOTH THE

AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT AND PRIVATE SECTOR HAVE EXCELLENT REASONS

TO DO BUSINESS WITH THE UNITED NATIONS IN  WHAT I  HOPE W ILL BE A

HAPPY M IX  OF ALTRUISM AND MUTUAL PRO FIT.
