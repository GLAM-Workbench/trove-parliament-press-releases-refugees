Michael Keenan MP - Federal Member for  Stirling More illegal boat arrivals transferred directly  to the mainland January 07, 2013

The latest boat arrival, carrying 78 people, is the second asylum seeker vessel in a row to be transferred directly to the  mainland, despite Labor’s promise to implement tough new offshore processing policies, Shadow Minister for Justice,  Customs and Border Protection Michael Keenan said.

“Not only are the latest boat arrivals not being sent for offshore processing on Nauru or Manus Island but they are also  bypassing the overcrowded Christmas Island detention centre and being sent directly to Darwin - a move that completely  undermines the point of having offshore processing laws in the first place,” Mr Keenan said.

“Every illegal boat arrival for 2013 has been transferred directly to the mainland, sending a strong and clear message to  the people smugglers that this Labor Government just isn’t serious about stopping them.

“So long as people continue to see that they have a very minimal chance of being sent for offshore processing under  Labor, then the influx of boats will continue to flood our borders.

“The Government has shown time and time again that they do not have the resolve or the will to crush the people  smuggling trade that has flourished in this region - there have already been 123 people arrive by boat in the first week of  the new year.

“Labor refuses to implement the full suite of tough Coalition border protection policies including temporary protection visas  and turning the boats back around when it is safe to do so.

“A Coalition government will stop the boats from coming - we have done it before and we will do it again,” Mr Keenan  said.
