"THE MANAGEMENT OF

AN AUSTRALIAN FOREIGN POLICY"

ADDRESS TO NEWCASTLE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE ÃÂª  INDUSTRY

MADE AT SHORTLAND ROOM, BROWN STREET, NEWCASTLE ON

THURSDAY' 15 APRIL 1982

FOR TOO LONG AUSTRALIA'S FOREIGN POLICY HAS BEEN DICTATED

BY WHAT HAD BEEN DECIDED IN LONDON, WASHINGTON AND TOKYO,

THE TIME IS LONG OVERDUE WHEN AUSTRALIA MUST PRODUCE A POLICY  ‘  _ . . Ã¢ÂÂ   \

WHICH IS MADE IN AUSTRALIA, WITH Q E  COUNTRY'S BEST INTERESTS

IN THE FOREFRONT, '

THIS DOES NOT MEAN THAT WE PLAN TO TURN OUR BACKS ON OUR

FRIENDS OF LONG STANDING, OR THAT AUSTRALIA WILL "GO IT  ALONE"

AND IGNORE WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE WORLD'S MAJOR CAPITALS.

ON THE CONTRARY, AUSTRALIA NEEDS TO BE BETTER INFORMED ON WHAT

IS HAPPENING IN THE WORLD SO THAT IT  CAN BEST FORMULATE ITS OWN.

ASSESSMENT OF INTERNATIONAL EVENTS AND DEC IDE., WHAT COURSE OF

ACTION IT  MUST FOLLOW, /

, , .2 /

THERE WAS SOMETHING FAINTLY LUDICROUS, FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE

PRIME MINISTER'S SHUTTLE V IS IT S  TO WASHINGTON AT THE BEGINNING

OF THE AFGHAN CRISIS LAST YEAR, '

AUSTRALIA IS A MIDDLE-SIZED POWER WITH LIMITED RESOURCES,

BOTH OF MANPOWER AND OF MONEY, AND WE MUST ORDER OUR PRIORITIES

SO THAT THESE CAN BE DEPLOYED AS EFFECTIVELY AND AS ADVANTAGEOUSLY

AS POSSIBLE. FLYING BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS TO WASHINGTON ON

AN ERRAND WHICH INVOLVED THE U .S. AND THE USSR AND A FAR OFF

COUNTRY WHICH IS OF ONLY MARGINAL INTEREST TO AUSTRALIA IS.

POINTLESS. THAT IS NOT TO T R IV IA LIZ E  THE SOVIET INVASION OF

AFGHANISTAN, BUT MERELY TO PUT IT  INTO PERSPECTIVE.

WE MUST CONDEMN PUBLICLY THE INFRINGEMENT OF SOVEREIGNTY, THE

DESTRUCTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS, THE CALLOUS DISREGARD FOR WORLD

OPINION SHOWN BY THE SOVIETS AND THEIR PUPPETS, AND ASSIST

WHERE WE CAN BY PROVIDING FOOD AID FOR THE MILLIONS OF REFUGEES

WHO HAVE GONE TO PAKISTAN. TO BEHAVE AS IF  WE WERE A PARTY

PRINCIPAL IN THIS AFFAIR IS S ILLY .

. . . 3 /

AUSTRALIA IS ABOUT 15% DEPENDENT ON EXPORTS FOR ITS EARNINGS,

WE NEED TO EXPORT IF  WE ARE TO GROW, WE NEED TO FIND OUTLETS

FOR OUR MANUFACTURED GOODS AND NOT JUST FOR OUR RAW MATERIALS,

THOUGH THOSE TOO MUST BE COMPETITIVELY MARKETED, ,

EXPORT MARKETING AND FINANCING IS , EACH YEAR MORE COMPLEX AND

COMPETITIVE. LOW WAGE COUNTRIES ARE BROADENING THEIR RANGE

OF EXPORTS. HIGHLY INDUSTRIALISED COUNTRIES SUCH AS JAPAN

ARE FIERCE IN THE COMPETITION THAT THEY PROVIDE.

THEY HAVE A HIGH DEGREE OF COORDINATION BETWEEN GOVERNMENT

AND INDUSTRY AND THE COUNTRY IS OFTEN REFERRED TO AS W A N

INCORPORATED." |

IT 'S  NO USE SAYING THAT THEIR SOCIETY IS OPPRESSIVE AND THAT

THEIR WAYS ARE NOT OUR WAYS. WHEN IT  COMES TO THE INTERNATIONAL

MARKETPLACE WE MUST COMPETE ON THEIR TERMS IF  WE EXPECT TO WIN,

. . ÃÂ /

AUSTRALIA, FOR EXAMPLE, IS WELL PLACED BECAUSE OF ITS .

SKILLED LABOUR FORCE, TO COMPETE IN HIGH TECHNOLOGY EXPORTS.

WHEN WE SPEAK OF FOREIGN POLICY TODAY, WE MEAN INCREASINGLY

"FOREIGN ECONOMIC POLICY". NEVER HAS IT  BEEN REALLY POSSIBLE Ã¢ÂÂ¢ ' .  Ã¢ÂÂ   e  '

TO SEPARATE COMMERCE FROM POLITICS, TRADE HAS ALWAYS FOLLOWED

THE FLAG.

TODAY, COMMERCE,. ECONOMICS AND POLITICS ARE- VERY CLOSELY INTER

TWINED AND WE NEED TO HAVE MACHINERY WHICH IS EQUAL TO THE

TASK DEMANDED OF IT . '

WE NEED TO REORGANISE FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN ORDER TO

BETTER EXPLOIT AUSTRALIA'S MAJOR ECONOMIC AND EMPLOYMENT

OPPORTUNITIES.

WE NEED TO HELP EXPORTERS TO CONFRONT SUCCESSFULLY TOUGH TRADE

COMPETITION ABROAD. WE MUST INCREASE OUR EXPORT DRIVE IN

ORDER TO ALLOW OUR INDUSTRIES TO EXPAND, TO MODERNIZE AND: TO

PROVIDE JOBS FOR YOUNG AUSTRALIANS.

5

THERE MUST BE A CLOSER COORDINATION OF ECONOMY-RELATED

DEPARTMENTS WITHIN THE GOVERNMENT IN ORDER TO MAKE THEM MORE

SENSITIVE AND RESPONSIVE TO ECONOMIC,DEVELOPMENT ISSUES IN

THE VARIOUS PARTS OF AUSTRALIA.

THESE AREAS MUST BE MADE TO WORK CLOSELY WITH THE CENTRAL

GOVERNMENT IN ORDER THAT THE EFFORT IS BETTER CO-ORDINATED SO.

THAT WE DON'T UNDERCUT ONE ANOTHER BUT CAN HOLD OUR OWN AGAINST

OUR OVERSEAS COMPETITORS.

THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF THE VARIOUS REGIONS OF AUSTRALIA

IS A COMPLEX ISSUE WHICH, IN THE SHADOW CABINET, IS RECEIVING

THE ATTENTION OF THOSE WHOSE PORTFOLIOS HAVE AN' ECONOMIC BIAS.  . f : ;Ã¢ÂÂ   .? - , , * ;

WHAT I AM CONCERNED ABOUT IS IMPLEMENTING IN IT IA T IV E S  WHICH

WILL INCREASE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S CAPACITY TO PURSUE

AGGRESSIVELY INTERNATIONAL EXPORT MARKETS FOR THE GOODS PRODUCED

BY EVERY REGION IN THIS COUNTRY, BE THEY RESOURCE PRODUCTS,

MANUFACTURED GOODS OR SERVICES, V

. . . 6 /

6

MUCH GREATER WEIGHT MUST BE ATTACHED TO ECONOMIC FACTORS

IN THE DESIGN OF FOREIGN POLICY AND THE CONDUCT OF OUR FOREIGN

RELATIONS TO ENSURE THAT THEY SERVE AUSTRALIA'S OBJECTIVES.

THIS DOES NOT MEAN THAT OUR RELATIONS WITH THE REST OF THE

WORLD W ILL.BE CONDUCTED SOLELY IN THE MARKETPLACE. IT  DOES

NOT MEAN THAT WE SHALL IGNORE THE POLITICAL, CULTURAL AND

SOCIAL ASPECTS OF OUR RELATIONS WITH OTHER COUNTRIES.

IN A COMPLEX WORLD WHERE CLEAR CUT DIVISIONS NO LONGER EXIST,

WE MUST RATIONALISE AND HARMONISE OUR EFFORTS AT FOREIGN DEALINGS

IF  WE ARE TO SUCCEED IN LOOKING AFTER OUR INTERESTS. COUNTRIES

DO NOT HAVE PERMANENT FRIENDS AND ENEMIES, ONLY PERMANENT i

INTERESTS. ' :

, *

FOREIGN RELATIONS ARE FLUID AND NEED CAREFUL MONITORING.

TRADE MATTERS ARE BECOMING,MORE CLOSELY CONNECTED WITH POLITICAL

MATTERS AS GOVERNMENTS ARE BECOMING MORE ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN

TRADE. AUSTRALIA MUST SPEAK WITH A STRONG UNIFIED VOICE ABROAD

WHEN IT  SPEAKS TO FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS ON MATTERS. OF CONCERN TO

OUR PRODUCERS AND MANUFACTURERS.

. . . 7 /

THE DEPARTMENT OF .

WE NEED TO RESTRUCTURE/FOREIGN AFFAIRS TO ENABLE IT  TO PURSUE Â·

AGGRESSIVELY AUSTRALIA'S EXPORT MARKETS SO AS TO GIVE PROPER

WEIGHT TO ECONOMIC MATTERS WHEN FORMULATING FOREIGN POLICY.

THE REORGANISATION WE PROPOSE WILL BE ACHIEVED WITHOUT INCREASING

THE SIZE OF THE GOVERNMENT OR THE COST OF THE PRESENT OPERATION.

THERE MAY EVEN BE CONSIDERABLE SAVINGS WHEN THE PRESENT DUPLICATION

OF EFFORT IS STOPPED. HOWEVER, THE MAIN OBJECTIVE IS NOT TO

REDUCE SPENDING AS SUCH BUT TO SPEND WHAT IS NECESSARY TO ENABLE

AUSTRALIA'S INTERESTSTO BE SAFEGUARDED. . ,

1  ... t h e

REORGANISATION WILL ENSURE THAT COMPETENT STAFF WILL NOT BE i ' ' '

LAID OFF OR DECLARED REDUNDANT, Ã¢ÂÂ   '

TO DEAL WITH THE ECONOMIC ASPIRATIONS OF THE STATES, THE DEPARTÂ­

MENT OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS WILL ESTABLISH A BRANCH RESPONSIBLE

FOR CO-ORDINATION WITH THE STATE GOVERNMENTS, WHICH WILL BE PERÂ­

SUADED TO CLOSE THEIR OVERSEAS O FFIC E S .Â· .

. . . 8 /

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ - 8 “  .

THESE PSEUDO-EMBASSIES COST THE AUSTRALIAN TAXPAYER DEARLY

THOUGH THE STATES ARE NOT FORTHCOMING IN REVEALING WHAT

THESE MISSIONS COST.

AUSTRALIAN STATES NO LONGER NEED AGENTS-GENERAL IN LONDON.

FURTHERMORE, THE STATES WHICH HAVE OFFICES IN TOKYO -  (NEW

SOUTH WALES, VICTORIA, QUEENSLAND, SOUTH AUSTRALIA AND WESTERN

AUSTRALIA) -  DO US A DISSERVICE, AS THEY 'COMPETE WITH ONE

ANOTHER INSTEAD OF PRESENTING TO THE JAPANESE A UNITED AUSTRALIAN

FRONT. Â·

IF  WE ASK THE STATES TO CLOSE DOWN THEIR OFFICES, WE MUST ENSURE

THAT OUR EMBASSIES ARE ADEQUATELY STAFFED TO PROVIDE THE

SERVICES WHICH THE STATES NEED TO DEVELOP THEIR EXPORT ECONOMIES. Ã¢ÂÂ   ' ‘ÃÂ¯ "

THE DEPARTMENTS OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE MAINTAIN SEPARATE

OFFICES IN EACH OF THE STATE CAPITALS.

THE STATE FOREIGN AFFAIRS OFFICES AND TRADE OFFICES SHOULD BE

COMBINED AND GIVEN A REAL ROLE TO PLAY. . . ' .

9

THE STATES HAVE TO KNOW WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND

AUSTRALIA ARE DOING AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MUST KNOW WHAT

THE NEEDS OF THE STATES ARE,

THIS WILL ALSO ENSURE THE MAXIMUM COORDINATION BETWEEN AID

PROGRAMMES AND AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRY. A LARGE'NUMBERS OF AUSTRALIAN

PRODUCED GOODS ARE ALREADY SENT OVERSEAS AS A ID , BUT WE MUST

ENSURE THAT THIS VALUABLE TOOL OF FOREIGN POLICY IS CLOSELY

GUIDED TO BENEFIT AUSTRALIAN MANUFACTURERS AND PRODUCERS AS WELL

AS THE AID RECIPIENTS. .

THE TRADE COMMISSIONER SERVICE SHOULDBE MOVED TO FOREIGN AFFAIRS,

THUS STRENGTHENING THE OVERSEAS SERVICE AS A WHOLE AND BRINGING ' * *  Ã¢ÂÂ

Ã¢ÂÂ   Â£  Ã¢ÂÂ

UNDER ONE ROOF THE ADMINISTRATION?OF OFFICERS WHO SERVE ABROAD.

TRADE COMMISSIONERS AND FOREIGN SERVICE OFFICERSWOULD HAVE THE

ONE DESIGNATION AND WORK CLOSELY TOGETHER BOTH ABROAD AND

IN STAFFING THE DEPARTMENT AT HOME. THIS WOULD. ENSURE THAT

THERE IS A GREAT DEAL OF COHESIVENESS IN COMMERCIAL AND ECONOMIC

WORK AND THAT POLITICAL CONSIDERATIONS ARE KEPT IN MIND. -

...1 0 /

WHAT AUSTRALIA WOULD EVENTUALLY HAVE IS A UNIFED PROFESSIONAL

OVERSEAS CAREER SERVICE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL THE

MAJOR ASPECTS OF AUSTRALIA'S DEALINGS WITH THE REST OF THE

WORLD -  COMMERCIAL, ECONOMIC, POLITICAL AND CULTURAL.

IN ORDER TO STAFF THE DEPARTMENT WITH THE COMPETENT PEOPLE WE WOULD

NEED, THERE WILL HAVE TO BE AN EXTENSIVE PROGRAMME OF SECONDMENTS

FROM DOMESTIC DEPARTMENTS AND FROM STATE GOVERNMENTS, AS WELL

AS FROM PRIVATE ENTERPRISE.

OFFICERS WITH EXPERIENCE ABROADW0UL1 BE TRANSFERRED IN TURN TO

THE HOME DEPARTMENTS AND SECONDED TO BUSINESS FIRMS. HOWEVER,

THE JURISDICTION AND CONTROL OF AUSTRALIA'S BUSINESS ABROAD

WOULD! REST'WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS .

PERMANENCY OF TENURE IN KEY POLICY DEPARTMENTS MUST END. JOB

SECURITY CAN BE GUARANTEED ONLY AT THE LOWER ECHELONS AS THE

MANAGERS OF THE PUBLIC SERVICE MUST, LIKE ALL MANAGERS, EARN > Ã¢ÂÂ   Ã¢ÂÂ  . *  Ã¢ÂÂ

DIVISIONS IN FOREIGN AFFAIRS SHOUIDBE GEOGRAPHICALLY ORIENTED

WITH DESKS OPERATING AS POLITICAL/ECONOMIC/CULTURAL ONES SO

AS TO LOOK AT THE TOTALITY OF AUSTRALIA'S RELATIONS WITH A

REGION . Â·. . * . /

COORDINATING BODIES WOULD OVERSEE THE WORK OF THE EXPANDED

FUNCTIONAL DIVISIONS TO ENSURE THAT THE LEFT HAND KNOWS WHAT

THE RIGHT IS DOING. .

THE REGIONAL OFFICERS WOULD PLAY KEY ROLES IN PROVIDING FEEDBACK

FROM THE CONSUMERS IN THE STATES. .

AN AUSTRALIAN COMMERCIAL CORPORATION SHOULD ALSO u BE SET

UP TO ENABLE AUSTRALIA TO TRADE ON A GOVERNMENT TO GOVERNMENT

BASIS. Â·

A' FEW LARGE MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS HAVE BUDGETS LARGER THAN

SOME COUNTRIES WITH WHICH AUSTRALIA EXCHANGES AMBASSADORS.

...1 2 /

12

WE PROPOSE SENDING "AMBASSADORS" TO THE MAJOR CORPORATIONS

SO THAT WE KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING AND CAN MAKE OUR INTERESTS

KNOWN TO THE MANAGEMENT OF THESE CONGLOMERATES.

THE EFFICIENT MANAGEMENT OF FOREIGN POLICY IS ESSENTIAL AND

THUS WE SHALL NEED TO ESTABLISH REVIEW TEAMS TO AUDIT IMPLEMENTATION

OF OUR PROGRAMMES AND EVALUATE THEIR COST/BENEFIT. REPORTS WILL

HAVE TO RECORD FAILURES AS WELL AS ACHIEVEMENTS. IT  IS NOT

DISHONOURABLE TO F A IL , PROVIDED IT 'S  DONE IN AN HONEST ATTEMPT

TO DO A JOB, BUT IT  IS STUPID AND USELESS NOT TO LEARN FROM OUR

MISTAKES.

BEFORE I TURN TO THE SPECIFIC ISSUE AFFECTING THE HUNTER VALLEY,

I WANT TO EMPHASISE THE VITAL ISSUE OF FOREIGN POLICY:DISARMAMENT.

UNLESS WE CAN BRING THIS ABOUT, UNLESS WE CAN STOP THE MADNESS

OF THE OVERKILL CAPABILITIES OF THE NUCLEAR WEAPONS POWERS, WE

SHALL CONTINUE TO LIVE IN FEAR OF TOTAL DESTRUCTION. WHAT IS

THE POINT OF TALKING ABOUT TRADE OR ANYTHING ELSE, IF  WE ARE

ALL TO BE CONSUMED IN A NUCLEAR HOLOCAUST?

...1 3 /

DURING 1981- IT  WAS EXPECTED THAT DURING THE 1 9 8 0 's  AUSTRALIA

WOULD EXPERIENCE A MINERALS AND ENERGY BOOM.

THE FEDERAL AND STATE GOVERNMENTS PROUDLY PRODUCED STATISTICS

SHOWING A MASSIVE UPSURGE IN PREDICTED INVESTMENT IN MINERALS

AND ENERGY PROJECTS, INCREASED EXPORT REVENUE, AND SIGNIFICANT

NEW EMPLOYMENT P O S S IB ILITIE S .

IT  WAS EXPECTED THAT THERE WOULD BE MAJOR ADDITIONS TO AUSTRALIA'S

ALUMINIUM SMELTING CAPACITY, PARTICULARLY IN THE HUNTER VALLEY,

AND THAT A VERY LARGE NUMBER OF NEW ENERGY PROJECTS WOULD

EITHER BE INITIATED OR EXPANDED. . .

FOR EXAMPLE, ACCORDING TO THE NEW SOUTH WALES DEPARTMENT OF

INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT AND DECENTRALISATION, RESOURCE-BASED .

INVESTMENT IN THE HUNTER VALLEY WAS ESTIMATED TO BE OVER

$7 BILLIO N IN JANUARY 1981 , INCLUDING $ 1 .3 5  BILLIO N IN ALUMINIUM

SMELTERS, $ 2 .6  BILLIO N  IN COAL MINES, AND $ 1 .8 5  BILLIO N  IN

POWER STATIONS.

-13-

-14-

THERE WERE A NUMBER OF REASONS FOR THE EXPECTATIONS THAT THERE

WOULD BE A MAJOR UPSURGE IN RESOURCES-BASED PROJECTS.

AUSTRALIA IS A POLITICALLY STABLE COUNTRY, WITH VAST MINERAL

AND ENERGY RESOURCES, AND A GENERALLY UNCRITICAL ATTITUDE

TO FOREIGN INVESTMENT.

FOR THE LARGE COMPANIES WHICH DOMINATE THE WORLD MINERAL AND

ENERGY INDUSTRIES, AUSTRALIA LOOKED LIKE A VERY PROFITABLE

PLACE TO INVEST.

THIS WAS ACCENTUATED BY TWO FACTORS. THE RISING PRICE OF LIQUID

FUELS IN OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD HAD BEGUN TO MAKE INDUSTRIES

BASED ON SUCH FUELS LESS ECONOMIC,-- NOTABLY ALUMINIUM SMELTERS

RELIANT ON ELECTRICITY GENERATED IN O IL-FIRED POWER STATIONS.

-15-

WITH ITS VAST AND RELATIVELY ACCESSIBLE COAL RESOURCES, AUSTRALIA

WAS A LOGICAL PLACE TO SHIFT SUCH INDUSTRIES. AS A RESULT,

WE SAW PLANS FOR A MAJOR RESTRUCTURING OF THE JAPANESE ALUMINIUM

SMELTING INDUSTRY AND ITS PARTIAL RELOCATION IN AUSTRALIA.

THE OTHER FACTOR WAS THE GENERALLY MORE CRITICAL ATTITUDE TAKEN

TO TRANSNATIONAL COMPANIES IN OTHER MINERAL/ENERGY-PRODUCING

COUNTRIES. .

MANY OTHER COUNTRIES HAD MOVED TO GAIN A GREATER SHARE OF THE

BENEFITS PRODUCED BY FOREIGN COMPANIES, EITHER THROUGH HIGHER

TAXATION AND ROYALTIES, GOVERNMENT OWNERSHIP, INTERVENTION

IN MINERAL MARKETING, OR.NATIONALISATIONS,

IN ADDITION, STRICTER CONTROLS RELATING TO THE ENVIRONMENT WERE

BEING IMPOSED ON THE COMPANIES, WHICH CONSIDERABLY INCREASED  Â· Â·  .  i  '  .  :  Ã¢ÂÂ   ' '

THEIR COSTS OF PRODUCTION,

AUSTRALIA, ON THE OTHER HAND, AS NOTED, HAS GENERALLY ADOPTED

AN UNCRITICAL ATTITUDE OT FOREIGN INVESTMENT, BOTH AT A FEDERAL

AND STATE GOVERNMENT LEVEL.

-16-

STATE GOVERNMENTS, IN PARTICULAR, HAVE VIED AGAINST EACH OTHER

TO ATTRACT FOREIGN INVESTMENT, AND HAVE OFTEN, AS A RESULT,

ERODED THEIR BARGAINING POWER AND ULTIMATELY THE BENEFITS

ACCRUING TO THEM. .

NO SERIOUS ATTEMPTS HAVE BEEN MADE IN AUSTRALIA, (UNLIKE IN

OTHER COUNTRIES) TO BECOME DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN THE MINERAL

AND ENERGY INDUSTRIES, TO INTERVENE IN THE INTERNATIONAL.

MARKETING OF OUR NATURAL RESOURCES, AND TO ATTEMPT TO PROMOTE

A GREATER TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER FROM FOREIGN CONTROLLED PROJECTS.

DESPITE THESE ATTRACTIONS, HOWEVER, IT  HAS ALL STARTED TO

GO SERIOUSLY WRONG. THERE HAS BEEN A SIGNIFICANT SCALING DOWN

OF THE PREDICTED INVESTMENTS, A DEFERRAL OF MANY OF THE NEW

PROJECTS, DELAYS IN THE.SIGNING OF CONTRACTS FOR ALREADY COMPLETED

PROJECTS, AND MAJOR REDUCTIONS IN;THE EXPECTED NEW EMPLOYMENT ' y . Â·

OPPORTUNITIES.

-17-

EVEN AS LATE AS LAST WEEK ALCAN ANNOUNCED HAT IT  WAS DEFERRING

THE COMMISSIONING OF THE THIRD POTLINE AT ITS KURRI KURRI SMELTER,

DUE TO THE : STATE OF THE WORLD ALUMINIUM INDUSTRY.

THIS IS NOT TO SAY, OF COURSE, THAT THERE WILL BE NO NEW

MINERALS AND ENERGY PROJECTS, BUT CERTAINLY THE PREDICTIONS .

OF A YEAR OR SO AGO ARE ALREADY.VERY MUCH OUT-OF-DATE.

PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR HAS BEEN THE STATE OF THE

WORLD ECONOMY.' , . '

MANY OF THE NEW PROJECTS WERE TO BE BASED ON EXPORT PRODUCTION, /

BUT ALREADY THE MAJOR EXPORT MARKETS ARE IN RECESSION. EVEN

THE USUALLY RESILIENT JAPANESE ECONOMY IS  BEGINNING TO DETERIORATE

AS THE WORLD RECESSION DEEPENS. THE POLICIES BEING PURSUED

BY THE PRESENT REAGAN ADMINISTRATION IN THE UNITED STATES, NOTABLY

ITS HIGH INTEREST RATE MONETARIST POLICIES, CAN ONLY MAKE THINGS

WORSE.

/

-18-

IF  THE WORLD ECONOMY DOES INDEED SINK INTO A DEEP DEPRESSION, t

AS SOME COMMENTATORS ARE NOW PREDICTING, THEN THERE ARE

GOING TO BE SOME HARD TIMES AHEAD FOR AUSTRALIA.

WE ALREADY HAVE A DISASTROUSLY HIGH LEVEL OF UNEMPLOYMENT AND

UNDER-EMPLOYMENT, WHICH COULD GO HIGHER DURING THE REST OF

THIS YEAR AND IN 1983. ... '

IMPORTANT SECTIONS OF AUSTRALIAN MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY ARE IN

DEEP C R IS IS, AND HAVE BEEN SO SINCE THE M ID -1 9 6 0 's .

FOR THE HUNTER VALLEY REGION, AND NEWCASTLE IN PARTICULAR, IT  IS

LIKELY THAT HARD TIMES L IE  AHEAD. BHP IS ALREADY EXPERIENCING

MAJOR DIFFICULTIES WITH ITS STEEL OPERATIONS, AND WE ALL KNOW THE

DIFFICULTIES THAT THIS WILL CREATE FOR THE WORKERS AND BUSINESSES

IN NEWCASTLE AND SURROUNDING AREAS. .

SOME NEW PROJECTS IN THE HUNTER VALLEY WILL GO AHEAD, BUT THESE

ARE UNLIKELY TO SOLVE THE SERIOUS SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC PROBLEMS

OF UNEMPLOYMENT ALREADY PREVALENT.

1

AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENTS, STATE AND FEDERAL, ARE GOING TO HAVE

TO BECOME MORE AWARE OF THESE ISSUES. IN THE 1 9 3 0 's  and

1 9 4 0 's , THIS COUNTRY FINALLY DECIDED THAT IT  COULD NO LONGER

RELY ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY ON THE EXPORT OF PRIMARY PRODUCTS, AND

MOVED TO DIVERSIFY ITS INDUSTRIAL BASE, TO CATER MORE TO A

GROWING DOMESTIC MARKET. . .

WE NEED TO LOOK TO THIS SORT OF REASSESSMENT IN THE 1 9 8 0 's  ‘

OR ELSE THIS COUNTRY IS GOING TO FIND THAT ITS PEOPLES' LIV IN G  -

STANDARDS WILL CEASE TO RISE, AND MAY INDEED BEGIN TO DECLINE*

WE WOULD HOPE THAT WITH AUSTRALIA'S TWO* LARGEST STATES UNDER

LABOR GOVERNMENTS, AND WITH A FEDERAL LABOR GOVERNMENT, THAT

CO-OPERATION COULD COME TO THE FORE.

THE CONFRONTAT ION IST APPROACH OF THE PRESENT FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

IS NO WAY TO DEAL WITH THE VERY SERIOUS PROBLEMS OF THE 1 9 8 0 's .

WE WOULD HOPE THAT GOVERNMENTS COULD FOSTER NEW INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT,

AND ENCOIJRAGE GREATER AGREEMENT BETWEEN TRADE UNIONS AND EMPLOYERS.

-19-

- 20-

A FORWARD LOOKING INDUSTRIAL STRATEGY IS  REQUIRED. IT  IS

IMPORTANT THAT WITH MANY OF THE EXISTING INDUSTRIES, PARTICULARLY

THE STEEL INDUSTRY, EXPERIENCING SUCH D I F F I C U L T I E S ^  THE VERY

HIGH LEVELS OF UNEMPLOYMENT PREVAILING AT THE PRESENT TIM E,

THAT CONSTRUCTIVE IDEAS FOR NEW INDUSTRIES BE DEVELOPED.

I BELIEVE WE SHOULD ESTABLISH AN INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT COMMISSION

SOMEWHAT ALONG THE LINES OF THE SECONDARY INDUSTRIES COMMISSION

ESTABLISHED DURING WORLD WAR 11.

I WOULD SEE THIS NEW COMMISSION OPERATING, AS DID ITS PREDECESSOR, Ã¢ÂÂ   ‘  - Ã¢ÂÂ

ALONG THE LINES OF INDUSTRY COUNCILS. SUCH INDUSTRY COUNCILS

WOULD INCLUDE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE MAJOR GROUPS ASSOCIATED WITH

THE INDUSTRY AND CONCERNED ABOUT ITS FUTURE DEVELOPMENT, INCLUDING . ?  Ã¢ÂÂ

STATE GOVERNMENTS, EMPLOYERS AND TRADE UNIONS.

# Â·

-21-

SUCH COUNCILS WOULD NOT ONLY DISCUSS THE PRESENT STATE OF THE

INDUSTRY BUT PROPOSALS FOR ITS FUTURE DEVELOPMENT AND GROWTH

PROSPECTS. THIS WOULD INCLUDE DISCUSSIONS OF NEW TECHNOLOGICAL

DEVELOPMENTS,_ MARKETING ARRANGEMENTS, POSSIBLE SUPPORT TO BE

GIVEN BY THE GOVERNMENTS AND ISSUES OF CONSIDERATION TO '

CONSUMERS. .

SUCH COUNCILS COULD BE USED FOR BRINGING NEW TECHNOLOGY INTO

AUSTRALIA AND STIMULATING THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW AUSTRALIAN

TECHNOLOGIES.

RECOMMENDATIONS COULD BE MADE FOR THE PROVISION OF VENTURE

CAPITAL FOR NEW INDUSTRIES OR COMPANIES, WITH NEW TECHNOLOGY,

TO ENABLE NEW DEVELOPMENTS TO PROCEED. .

ENCOURAGEMENT COULD BE GIVEN TO THE INVOLVEMENT OF TRADE UNIONS  .  .  .  i- Ã¢ÂÂ

IN THE PROVISION OF VENTURE CAPITAL TO NEW COMPANIES, PARTICULARLY

THROUGH THE SUPERANNUATION FUNDS OF TRADE UNION MEMBERS. .#  Â· '

&

FINALLY, ENCOURAGEMENT SHOULD BE GIVEN FOR COMPANIES AND

INDUSTRIES TO BE BROUGHT INTO AGREEMENTS WITH THE TRADE UNION

MOVEMENT. SUCH AGREEMENTS WOULD DIRECLTY ADDRESS ISSUES SUCH

AS THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW TECHNOLOGY, WORKING CONDITIONS,

HEALTH AND SAFETY AND WORKING HOURS.

THE RECENT AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE M . T . I . A .  AND THE METAL TRADES

UNIONS REPRESENTS THE BEGINNING OF SUCH COMPREHENSIVE INDUSTRY

AGREEMENTS.

IN CONCLUSION, I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT WE WOULD GIVE ENCOURAGEMENT

FOR THE MAJOR GROUPS IN INDUSTRY TO GET TOGETHER AND FORMULATE

PLANS FOR THEIR INDUSTRIES AND THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT APPROPRIATE

GOVERNMENT MACHINERY, AS I HAVE SUGGESTED IN THE FORM OF AN

‘ INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT COMMISSION IS NECESSARY FOR CO-ORDINATION Ã¢ÂÂ   Ã¢ÂÂ   Ã¢ÂÂ

-22-

OF SUCH PLANS. I
