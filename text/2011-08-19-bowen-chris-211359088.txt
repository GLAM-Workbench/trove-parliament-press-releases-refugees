AUSTRALIA AND PAPUA NEW GUINEA SIGN MEMORANDUM  OF UNDERSTANDING

The governments of Australia and Papua New Guinea have signed a Memorandum of  Understanding for the establishment of an assessment centre on Manus Island, the  Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Chris Bowen MP, said today.

The Papua New Guinea Minister for Foreign Affairs and Immigration, Ano Pala, and  Australia’s High Commissioner to Papua New Guinea, Ian Kemish, signed the  Memorandum of Understanding in Port Moresby this afternoon.

Mr Bowen said the signing was the positive next step towards establishing an  assessment centre on Manus Island.

“This is a welcome and important development in setting up an assessment centre  on Manus Island for asylum seekers and formalises this arrangement between  Australia and Papua New Guinea,” Mr Bowen said.

“Our two countries share a strong and longstanding relationship on migration and  recognise the need for cooperative measures to respond to the complex regional  challenge of irregular migration.

“This Government is committed to breaking the people smuggling trade. The Manus  Island centre will complement the Malaysia transfer arrangement and provide further  disincentive for people considering risking their lives on dangerous boat journeys.”

Mr Bowen said the Memorandum of Understanding provided a framework for  ongoing discussions with PNG on the operational details of the assessment centre.

“We are committed to working in partnership with PNG to operationalise the  assessment centre at the earliest opportunity,” he said.

“This MOU sends a clear message that countries in this region are working together  towards a lasting regional response in taking action necessary to ensure the integrity  of our borders and undermine people smuggling networks.”
