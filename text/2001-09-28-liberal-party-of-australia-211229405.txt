Community Grants to Attack Racism and Promote Harmony

MPS 168/2001

Grants totalling just over $1.5 million for "Living in Harmony" projects designed to attack racism and promote community harmony were announced today by the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock.

The grants to 37 new recipients are for projects to address a wide range of issues including a lack of understanding regarding some ethnic and religious groups.

"Several projects will work with Muslim communities, refugee and migrant support organisations to promote harmony and address misconceptions about Islamic culture. A number of others incorporate reconciliation themes and work with indigenous communities," Mr Ruddock said.

"The community grants program is the core of the Government's Living in Harmony initiative as it enables communities to find locally relevant solutions to local problems.

"There is no place for racism in Australia and everyone has a role to play in achieving social harmony, which is the hallmark of our successful, diverse society."

Mr Ruddock said the grants helped people to work together. It was extremely pleasing to see so many funding applications from young people focusing on their role in spreading the message of a successful, harmonious and diverse society.

The Minister said the grants were Australia-wide and in addition to capital cities covered many regional and remote areas such as Carnarvon, Kalgoorlie, Karratha, Whyalla, Coober Pedy, Morwell, Ballarat, Alice Springs, Yeppoon, Condobolin, Lachlan, Casino and Nambucca Heads.

Projects use many formats including youth theatre and forums; arts based projects; radio shows and talk back forums; sports policy and mentors; and work with students and school

communities to strengthen positive attitudes. The Council for Multicultural Australia takes a particular interest in the grants and will work with successful organisations to further promote and extend the harmony message.
