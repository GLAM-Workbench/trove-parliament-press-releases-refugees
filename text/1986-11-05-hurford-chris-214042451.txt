VISIT BY FORMER IRIAN JAYAN RESIDENTS

I have been asked to respond to claims allegedly made by  Mr Jacob Prai,  a visitor from Sweden who was formerly a  resident of Irian Jaya,  that he would not have been  allowed entry had we been"aware of his visit. This is not

correct.

Mr Prai and his associates,  who are Swedish citizens,  were  issued with visitor visas in Stockholm. Their visit was  approved.

As with other visitors,  they were required to sign  declarations stating they would not seek change of status  while in Australia. We expect them to keep to their word  and leave Australia before their visas expire.

They are free to move and speak openly while here -  provided they do not promote or incite violence.

I have always defended freedom of speech and will continue  to do so. I believe this is a mark of a democratic  society. The Opposition, however, advocates strict  censorship and the banning of entry of people who hold  views contrary to their own.

Mr Prai has been a resident of Sweden since 1979. He has  Swedish citizenship and travels on a Swedish passport. It  is absurd to suggest that he could successfully claim  refugee status in Australia.
