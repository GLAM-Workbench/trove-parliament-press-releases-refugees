BOTTOM LINE - ANOTHER BOAT ARRIVES

Â

The Opposition’s prediction that the next boat carrying illegal 
immig rants could arrive as far south as Sydney Harbour has proved 
true with the discovery of a cargo boat carrying a suspected 80 illegal 
immigrants off Jervis Bay, Shadow Justice and Customs Minister, Duncan 
Kerr, said ‘today.

Â

Mr Kerr congratulated authorities for swift action 
to apprehend the vessel before it came ashore, but this, like previous 
incidents, leaves substantial questions yet to be answered.

Â

“These arrivals appear to be occurring on a regular 
monthly basis,” Mr Kerr said.

Â

“It’s as if they are operating on a timetable 
- next stop Bateman’s Bay, then all stops to Melbourne.

Â

“While this boat was apprehended, the last two slipped 
through, arriving at Cairns and near Coffs Harbour.

Â

“Air Vice Marshal Alan Heggen’s secret report 
on the previous landings must now be released. The Australian public 
was told the Minister could not comment on what had gone wrong until 
she had the report. Senator Vanstone has had the report for some time. 
She has run out of excuses.

Â

“Yesterday’s arrival of yet another vessel reinforces 
the Opposition’s argument that a quick fix is no fix.

Â

“Senator Vanstone was nowhere to be seen during 
the last two beachings.

Â

“This time, her department detected a boat and called 
in the Navy to apprehend it - and Senator Vanstone is now all over the 
place claiming credit.

Â

“Senator Vanstone must use her new-found visibility 
to develop a proper and coordinated response to these arrivals - and 
she must release the Heggen report.”
