BUDGET STATEMENT BY THE MINISTER FOR SOCIAL SECURITY,  SENATOR THE HON. F M CHANEY - 18 AUGUST 1981

The Government has allocated $9865 million in the Budget to  pensions, benefits and other welfare payments and services  provided through the Department of Social Security.  This is  $1265 million more than was spent in 1980-81, representing

an increase of 14.7 per cent.

The main reason for this rise, apart from increases in the  numbers of pensioners and beneficiaries, is the automatic .   indexation of the major pensions and benefits, introduced by  the Government in 1976, to maintain the base rates of these

payments. The annual cost of pension indexation is estimated to be  $716 million for increases that will be payable from November 1981  and May 1982 and the Budget allocation includes a sum of $281 million  to provide for these rises during the remainder of the 1981-82  financial year.

These figures illustrate not only the cost but also the degree of  the Government's commitment to its policy of protecting basic  pensions against inflation.  The Government regards automatic  rises in the basic rate of pensions and benefits in line with  consumer price index increases as a crucial element in ensuring

social justice for people whose major or only source of income support  is their pension.

Since coming into office in 1975 the Government's application of  its indexation policy has meant that the standard rate of pension  has risen by $27.90, or over 70 per cent, in line with consumer  price index movements. Sickness benefits for people 18 years and  over and unemployment benefits for those with dependants have been

adjusted in the same way.

In the same period the upper limits at which people can receive  some pension payment have risen by $55.80 to $153.30 for a  single person and by $93.20 to $256.70 for a married couple.

Under the pension indexation policy,  the basic rate of Social  Security pensions and benefits will rise by $3.05 a week for a  single person and by $5.10 a week for a married couple from  November. Some 1.9 million pensioners and beneficiaries will

receive the increased payments.

The new rates will be in line with the increase of 4.6 per cent  in the CPI between the December quarter 1980 and the June quarter  1981. (

The standard rate of single pension or benefit will be $69.70 a  week and the rate for a married couple will be $116.20 a week.

In the case of age, invalid, wives' and widows' pensions and  supporting parents' benefits the new rates will operate from  the first payday in November - Thursday, November 5.

In the case of unemployment, sickness and special benefits the  first payment at the new rates will be made on the individual  beneficiary's first payday after 1 November 1981.

The Government has also decided to increase the rate of unemployment  benefit paid to people aged 18 years and over who have no dependants.  This rate will rise by $4.65 to $58.10 a week from the first  benefits payday in November.

In addition to the increased amounts necessary to cover rises in  the numbers of pensioners and beneficiaries and the indexation  commitment,  the Budget allocations for the Department of Social '   Security include $244 million for an extra pension  payday this year.  (There will be 27 instead of the usual 26  pension paydays in 1981-82).

The other main elements in the Budget allocations to the  Department of Social Security are to cover new Government  initiatives to: '

.  assist large families by increasing family  allowance rates for third and subsequent  children

. increase and redirect supplementary assistance  provisions towards those pensioners who are  paying higher rents

.  increase the allocations to assist handicapped  and aged people and for children's services.

In the context of its commitment to the welfare of Australian  families, the Government has decided to substantially increase  assistance to families with three or more children. In doing this,  it is recognising the special needs of large families.

From January 1982, the rates of family allowance for third and  subsequent children will be increased by 50 per cent.

The new rates will be:

First child  Second child  Third child  Fourth child

Fifth and su  children

$15.20 a month  $21.70 a month  $39.00 a month  $39.00 a month

$45.55 a month

(no change) (no change) ($13 increase)  ($13 increase)

($15.20 increase)

Other means by which the concentration of assistance to those  most in need will be pursued include:

.  strengthening the provisions in the Social Services Act against schemes contrived, through  artificial reductions in income, to qualify  people for pensions and pensioner concessions

they do not really need;

. the development of a crisis accommodation program  with special emphasis on the needs of families;

.  new arrangements about the circumstances in which  people caring for refugee children may be eligible  to receive an orphans pension.

The Government is concerned that, in the welfare area as well  as in taxation, income rigging practices are circumventing the  intent of the laws and throwing undue burdens on taxpayers  generally. In turn such practices make it more difficult to help  genuinely needy people.

The Social Services Act already has provisions aimed at  preventing people who are well able to maintain themselves from  deliberately arranging their affairs so that they become eligible  for higher rates of pension.

These provisions, like the pension income test, are an essential  part of the mechanisms for ensuring that available assistance  is focussed on those who are least protected and that the already  large demands made by the welfare system on taxpayers are not

further increased.

It has become evident that there is a growing practice of avoiding  income for pension purposes, or even more commonly for pensioner  Ã¢ÂÂ fringe benefits. There is no essential difference, so far as the  general community effect is concerned, between this and tax

avoidance. It is, quite simply, the welfare face of the income  rigging coin.

We shall therefore be moving during the Budget session of  Parliament to tighten up the relevant legislation so as to prevent  income avoidance for pension purposes by such devices as keeping  large sums of capital in non-interest bearing accounts or by  participation in other income avoidance schemes that are being  promoted within the community. For example there are schemes  which produce no 1  income1  to pensioners but enable them

to withdraw capital equal to the amount of income that would be  payable under a normal investment arrangement. In other words,  income is withdrawn in the guise of capital.

As an example, a family with four children will gain $26.00 a  month, a family with five children $41.20 a month, and a family  with six children $56.40 a month. .

The payment in respect of the 10,000 children being cared for in  institutions will be increased from $21.70 to $39.00 a month.

In total, some 540,000 families will benefit by these new  arrangements. The cost of this initiative in the current financial  year will be $62 million, representing $124 million in a full year.

The Government has given particular attention to helping other  groups in special need and in this context has decided to change,  from February 1982, the system of supplementary assistance or  allowance payable to pensioners, including supporting parent  beneficiaries, and sickness beneficiaries, who pay rent. The  changes to be made will:

. direct most assistance to those paying  higher rents in the private rental market;

. provide a higher maximum rate of assistance; and

.  introduce a more gradual income test.

The maximum rate of rental assistance will rise by $3 to $8  a week and, to ensure that assistance is concentrated on those  pensioners and beneficiaries who have to pay higher rents, it  will only be paid for rents in excess of $10 a week at the rate  of 50 cents for each $1 of rent above this amount up to a

maximum rate of $8 at rents of $26 or more.

The income test for rental assistance will be changed so that  the amount received will be reduced by a withdrawal rate of 50  per cent of the pensioner's assessable income.

Tenants of State or Territory housing authorities will not be  eligible for assistance under the new provisions because they  are already, in effect, receiving an element of government subsidy.

These new provisions, which will ensure that in future more  assistance will be available to those pensioners and beneficiaries  paying higher amounts of rent, will not operate to the disadvantage  of any existing pensioners and beneficiaries.

In cases where people would be made worse off by the changes they  will continue to receive assistance on the basis of current rates  and conditions. ,

The related income-test-free incentive allowance for all people  who receive a sheltered employment allowance will also be  increased to $8 a week.

The new provisions will not operate to penalise people if they  liquidate income-producing assets for reasonable purposes, such  as the purchase of a home, a c a r , or a holiday. Similarly, they  will not operate to prevent people from keeping reasonable amounts  of money in non-interest bearing current accounts.

In the area of crisis accommodation,  my colleague, the Minister  for Housing and Construction, and I will be taking up with the  States the development of a special program of crisis accommodation  for families for which $2 million has been allocated by the  Commonwealth in 1981-82. This will be in addition to the $6.3 million  allocated for the Homeless Persons Assistance Program which my  department administers.

The Social Services Act will be amended during the year to bring  certain refugee children within the definition of a 'double orphan1.

At present, a person who has the care of a child both of whose  parents are dead, or.-where one parent is dead and the whereabouts  of the other is unknown, is entitled to a double orphan's pension  of $55.70 a month. In the case of a refugee child, it is often a

question of not knowing whether the parents are alive or dead or  not knowing where they are. In some cases the parents are known  to be overseas, but the parent and the child cannot be reunited  and the parent cannot provide economic support.  The circumstances  of these children are similar to 'double orphans' and so the  Government proposes to pay a double orphan's pension to people  who are caring for refugee children whose parents are not in  Australia or whose whereabouts are unknown.

To correct anomalies in the provisions governing eligibility  for some pensions and benefits the Government has decided to  amend the Social Services Act in relation to the granting of  wives pension and the payment of unemployment benefit to the

spouses of certain people.

Recent legal advice to the Government has dislosed a weakness  in the operation of the Social Services Act in relation to the  administration of wives pensions. This means that these pensions  may currently be granted to women resident overseas even if they  have never lived in Australia, while other pensions require the

applicant to be resident in Australia. The proposed amendment will  ensure uniformity of treatment for applicants for all types of  pensions by bringing wives pensions into line with the broad policy  that if an Australian pension is to be payable abroad it must be

in force when the pensioner leaves Australia.

It is also proposed to amend the Act to prevent payment of  unemployment benefit to the spouse of a person engaged in industrial  action or the spouse of a person who in certain circumstances has  been refused unemployment benefit, or had the benefit cancelled  or postponed. An example would be where a person's unemployment  benefit is cancelled because an offer of a job has been refused  without good reason. Peopledwhose benefit is refused, cancelled  or postponed in these circumstances will also be ineligible for

special benefit, although their spouses may qualify for such a  payment in cases where extreme hardship would otherwise result.

With the aim of providing a better service to clients in remote  areas, my department is to experiment with the use of paid  agents as a point of contact for the receipt of pensions and  benefits and for obtaining information about social security mattersÃ¢ÂÂ

In 1981-82 a pilot program, involving the appointment of ten paid  agents, will be conducted at a cost of $27,000. While the  department has undertaken, in recent years, an extensive  decentralisation program, involving the opening of many more

local Social Security offices, there are still many remote areas  where it is not practical for an office to be established. It  is expected that the paid agents experiment will be of particular  benefit to people in such areas including remote Aboriginal  communities.

In this, the International Year of Disabled Persons, the  Government has further consolidated and developed its support for  programs to assist mentally and physically disabled people. Both  the Handicapped Persons Assistance Scheme and the Commonwealth  Rehabilitation Service administered by my department have received

increased allocations for the current financial year, of $57.33  million and $28.65 million respectively.

We have decided:

.  to expand further the successful work preparation  program for training mildly intellectually retarded  young people. The success of this program is  illustrated by the fact that during 1979-80, the  Granville Centre in Sydney placed some 75 per cent of

its clients in gainful employment, and follow-up studies  show that this high rate of employment is maintained. The Government has decided, in addition to the two new  centres currently being established in Sydney and  Melbourne, to establish a further three new work  preparation centres, one each in Brisbane, Adelaide and

Perth. .

. to provide a further $300,000 to upgrade the quality and  effectiveness of existing services for the handicapped.

.  to provide $300,000 in 1981-82 for a new permanent scheme  of assistance for the production and publication of braille  and audio books for the print-handicapped.  This is the  first time that assistance in this area has been extended

beyond braille.

. to provide taxation deductions for gifts made in 1981-82  to the Commonwealth and State Committees for the  International Year of Disabled Persons. .

We have also, as I have mentioned, raised the incentive allowance  for those in sheltered employment. '  -  i:  '  ,  .

These measures are only a limited part of the Commonwealth's  recognition of the needs of the disabled, which are regarded  as having special significance in this International Year.

In other subsidy programs through which the Government directs  assistance to groups with particular needs, allocations have been  increased to $58 million for aged and disabled persons accommodation  and $80.1 million for children's services, including pre-schools.

In conclusion I would like to re-emphasise that the Government's  attitude to the social security area in this Budget has been to  maintain a steady course, introducing whfere possible worthwhile  increases in provisions for those whose circumstances are

such as to justify a special focus of assistance.

Our approach reflects our concern to assist those in greatest  need, against a background of overall expenditure restraint, and  -is—the -approach-most likely to contribute to the overall welfare of  all Australians.
