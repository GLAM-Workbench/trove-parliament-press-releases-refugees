E&OE

ALAN JONES:

Tony Abbott’s on the line from our studio in Canberra. Tony Abbott, good morning.

TONY ABBOTT:

Good morning Alan.

ALAN JONES:

Just in relation to the fudging and these are very serious issues because the Prime  Minister was given a forum on the ABC the other night with young people at the Old  Parliament House and he was asked a question about laptop computers and he said  laptops which is Computers in Schools, “we said we’d have a computer for every  young person at secondary school from Year Nine and above I seem to recall by  2013 or thereabouts”. Now, the rollout was to be done by 2011. Have we got a Prime  Minister here who fiddles with the truth?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look I think the short answer is yes, Alan, and all of these broken promises I think  are examples of the Prime Minister squirming and sliding to try to get around the fact  that he’s misled people. The greatest broken promise of all is the promise to take  over the public hospital system if it wasn’t fixed. There’s a whole litany of them.

ALAN JONES:

The reason I am ask you this is we’re talking to young people and they’re entitled to  believe their Prime Minister. So here they are, they’ve got no way of checking the  authenticity of what they’re saying. He said we’re on track about the computers in  doing that, we’ve about 260,000 computers out there in schools now. Can I just say  that is a fact. Now, according to Senate Estimates, 154,000 are out there and there  were one million promised. What are young people to make? They believe their  Prime Minister.

TONY ABBOTT:

I have daughters that are in or have just been in senior secondary school and I’ve  got to say they didn’t appear to be getting any computers from Kevin. Now, you  could probably say Alan that they don’t need computers from Kevin but he did  promise to give it to them and yet I don’t think there’s been too much delivery, so this  is why people feel increasingly cynical towards their Prime Minister.

ALAN JONES:

You were a Health Minister, federal Health Minister. He said to these young people  on national television ‘my predecessor ripped a billion dollars out of the public  hospital system’ but, according to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare,  federal government expenditure on public hospitals went from $5.2 billion in ’95-’96  to ten years later $10.7 billion. But he says to these young people my predecessor  ripped a billion dollars out of the public hospital system. Is that a lie?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, what happened was that in 1996, long before I was the Health Minister, the  forward estimates were reduced by one billion dollars. Now, was the money going to  public hospitals ever reduced? No, it was not. But the rate of growth of funding was  decreased and that’s why Kevin Rudd keeps repeating this ‘he ripped a billion dollars  out of health’. I did not rip a billion dollars out of health. The rate of growth was  slowed somewhat but Commonwealth funding for public hospitals has increased  year-in year-out and it certainly increased fast while I was the Health Minister.

ALAN JONES:

What do you make of the Governor of the Reserve Bank’s comments yesterday at  this symposium in Sydney when he said to Australians, well look, you can look  forward to lengthy periods - his words - of rather low short-term interest rates but  only if the Government commits itself to reducing debt.

TONY ABBOTT:

It’s very interesting, isn’t it Alan? Right at the moment you’ve got the Reserve Bank  with its foot on the brake and you’ve got the Treasurer, the Government, with its foot  on the accelerator. Now what the Reserve Bank Governor said yesterday was I can  take my foot off the brake but only if the Government takes its foot off the  accelerator, only if the Government stops spending like a drunken sailor. Now, this  was I think an unmistakable warning to the Government that if it keeps spending the  way it is interest rates are going to go up and up and up with disastrous  consequences for homebuyers and for small business.

ALAN JONES:

On this climate change thing, the Government seems unprepared or unable to tell us  what will happen to prices, electricity prices and others, if the Government goes from  a five per cent emissions reduction scheme to what it’s saying, eventually 25 per  cent. I mean they’ve set a target for 2050 of 60 per cent. Don’t the public have a right  to know what the cost of these increases will be, given that the Government is  putting before the Parliament what its projections are?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well that’s exactly right, Alan, and Kevin Rudd couldn’t explain the impact of his  great big new tax on the price of a loaf of bread. Well, it seems that the price of a loaf  of bread will go up by between three per cent and seven per cent, depending on how  much electricity is used in that particular loaf’s manufacture and this is the kind of

detail that the Prime Minister has to be able to give to the public if the public are to  believe that he’s thought it through, and increasingly it’s pretty clear that he hasn’t  thought it through which is why so many Labor backbenchers are now extremely  nervous about the policy that their Prime Minister has committed them to.

ALAN JONES:

Now when you then released an alternative policy, they straight away went to the  bureaucracy to burn the midnight oil to present a response to your policy. Am I right  in saying that the Government, whether it was Kevin Rudd or Penny Wong, passed  these confidential departmental briefing documents to selected people within the  media?

TONY ABBOTT:

Yeah, Penny Wong was prowling the press gallery handing this thing out but refusing  then to answer questions on it which is understandable because this is a  Government which still won’t release modelling of its own scheme but claims to be  able to produce and release modelling on the Opposition’s scheme within 36 hours  of its release. Well, I mean there’s a con job going on here, Alan.

ALAN JONES:

Is there any likelihood of the government doing a deal do you think with Bob Brown  who now is saying he wants a carbon tax as an alternative and they need seven  votes to pass this legislation. Now you know it has very significant ramifications for  the wellbeing of the economy. Is there any circumstance under which they would  accommodate the Bob Brown demand?

TONY ABBOTT:

I doubt it. I think if Kevin Rudd tried to do a deal with Bob Brown he would totally  shred what little economic credibility he’s got because Bob Brown’s problem with  even the Government’s scheme is that it’s too friendly to business. Well, it’s not  friendly at all to business, it’s an enormous slug on business but nevertheless Bob  Brown, who is a very sincere man - he’s a man who believes passionately about  protecting the environment by his own lights - but he thinks that the Government’s  scheme is a sell-out to the environment. Of course, it is also a terrible danger to  consumers and to business.

ALAN JONES:

The new workplace laws give Fair Work Australia and its president responsibility to  ensure that the Fair Work - I’m just reading their words - the Fair Work umpire  works efficiently and “adequately service the needs of employers and employee”’ in  a way that is “fair and just” and “quick, informal and avoids unnecessary  technicalities”. It’s “open and transparent”, it “promotes harmonious and cooperative  workplace relations”. How’s this going to happen with the union movement on the  move and on the make given what’s happened in Western Australia with industry-wide claims and more strikes? Do you get harmonious and cooperative workplace  relations out of that and what is the risk to the economy?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, it’s a huge risk and plainly when you’ve got situations as we did in the west a  week or so back where you’ve got key workers striking and jeopardising a multi-billion dollar development and ultimately getting a $50,000 a year increase without  any productivity improvements and these are people who were already earning  about $150,000 a year. That is going to be extremely damaging to the economy. It  damages our reputation with our overseas customers and these sorts of wage rises  then flow through to sectors that aren’t as readily able to afford them with  consequent job losses and, you know Alan, Kevin Rudd used to say that John  Howard had wasted the boom, he’d wasted the China boom, well the way Kevin  Rudd’s going he’s going to kill the China boom by these sorts of cave-ins to the  union movement and of course one of the things that is likely to come out of the  Henry Review is a resource rent tax which will be a terrible burden on that industry.

ALAN JONES:

I’ll talk to you later, not today, about the Henry Review but I just want to pursue this  one on one more tack. The president of Fair Work Australia is allegedly, I say  allegedly going to be questioned at Senate estimates hearing today, but last October  when this same man was asked to appear, Justice G-i-u-d-i-c-e, I don’t know how  you pronounce that name…

TONY ABBOTT:

Giudice.

ALAN JONES:

Giudice. Well when Justice Giudice was asked to appear before a Senate estimates  committee to answer questions about so-called award modernisation, he refused.  The Senate passed a motion compelling him to appear. I mean here’s a bloke who’s  running the show. Isn’t he obligated to explain how he’s running the show?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, then he said that as president of the Industrial Relations Commission he had  the status of a federal court judge and therefore shouldn’t be obliged to appear. Now  of course he’s effectively running an agency of government, Fair Work Australia, and  I think that’s why it’s much more likely that he’s going to come now than before.

ALAN JONES:

Some interesting questions to answer. You’ve presented a private member’s bill into  the parliament this week to overturn Queensland legislation called Wild Rivers which  declares, for the benefit of my listeners, three major waterways on Cape York wild  rivers, and it prevents development of land near those rivers or their catchment  areas. Noel Pearson, the respected Aboriginal spokesman, has called Tony Abbott’s  private member’s bill ‘historic’. He has accused the Queensland Government of  riding roughshod over Aboriginal rights and he talks about an opposition leader  prepared to stand up for Aboriginal rights and give proper respect to Aboriginal  people and their legal right to operate their properties in the way they decide. Now

given, Tony Abbott, that this was a deal to secure Green preferences and given that  the Prime Minister apologised to Aboriginal people when he first became Prime  Minister, why isn’t he moving this legislation in the Parliament and not you?

TONY ABBOTT:

That’s a good question Alan and when I did introduce the legislation the other night I  appealed to the Prime Minister, I said, look I’m not out to gain any personal kudos  here, I just want this terrible problem fixed, and I said if the Prime Minister had been  fair dinkum in his apology about matching the rhetoric with real benefits for  Aboriginal people this is precisely the kind of thing that needs to be done because at  the moment the Aboriginal people of Cape York they are supposed to have land  rights but their land rights have been given with one hand and then taken away with  the other through this Queensland legislation. So it really is an abominable piece of  work, a terrible betrayal of Aboriginal people by the Queensland Government and if  Kevin Rudd won’t support this bill or something like it of his own, he is complicit in  that betrayal.

ALAN JONES:

Any reaction from the Prime Minister to this?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, none thus far.

ALAN JONES:

You and I addressed a rally last Tuesday in Canberra over the confiscation of  farmers’ rights. Kevin Rudd said he was scratching his head to know what it was  about. Has he any understanding of this detail or any detail?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I think the problem is that the Prime Minister is becoming a slave to the  arrogance of office and look they say sooner or later all Prime Ministers succumb to  this, but Kevin Rudd seems to have succumbed very early. I mean it took John  Howard 11 and a half years to get a bit of wax in his ear, but Kevin Rudd seems to  have that problem almost from the word go.

ALAN JONES:

It is half past 7. I will just stay with Tony Abbott for a moment. On that public rally  Canberra, where, put simply, governments, state and federal, but predominately  state, at the direction of the Rudd Government, are confiscating farmers’ land with no  compensation. Should there be in any circumstance, anywhere in this proud and free  country the confiscation of private property without compensation?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well I don’t believe there should be Alan and the Federal Government can’t do it  because it is in the Constitution, you know the just terms clause is there in the  Constitution and frankly the state governments shouldn’t be allowed to get away with

what they have. And the South Australian Liberal government, back about a decade  ago I’m pleased to say was the only state government which has provided for  compensation for these environmental protection laws, but I can certainly understand  why a lot of people feel very ripped off by them.

ALAN JONES:

The Prime Minister went strong at the last election on GroceryWatch; he was going  to do something about grocery prices. Do you concede that that won’t happen unless  de-mergers occur with outfits like Coles and Woolworths. I mean everyone out there  knows about predatory pricing and geographic price discrimination. Would you be in  favour of tightening legislation to prevent both? I mean these things are criminal  offences in the United States?

TONY ABBOTT:

Alan, this is one of the things that we’ll be looking at. Obviously this is a big issue for  small business. Small business I think is the victim of oppressive conduct by big  business and at the moment they have certain legal rights but they are very hard to  exercise in practice because the big boys can tie them up in legal knots and just  outspend them in the courts. So, I think we do need to look long and hard at how we  can make the rights of small business a reality.

ALAN JONES:

Should an outfit though like Woolworths, heavily into retail, and the public don’t know  also be building monopoly in petrol, in hardware, in hotels, in poker machines?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well look Woolworths is a great business but it is also a very, very big business and I  guess you’ve got to ask yourself to what extent is it good for our economy to have  one business in such a dominant position in so many sectors. Now the ACCC is  supposed to be policing all of this and look I am not in the business of being too  critical of the regulatory agencies, but I think these are very fair questions which a lot  of people are asking and they are not very satisfied with the answers that come back  from Prime Minister Rudd.

ALAN JONES:

Absolutely. On border protection, ASIO has now admitted that under Senate  questioning it had to fast-track security checks on 78 refugees being held in  Indonesia following the Oceanic Viking standoff in order to allow the Federal  Government to meet the terms of a special deal to resettle them. So, in other words,  ASIO is colluding that a special deal was made to bring 78 illegal people into  Australia, all medical benefits, housing, social security and permanent residency.  How do we know about the criminal checks and the health checks of these people?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well we don’t essentially and the agreement was made, it seems, to bring them in  before all these checks were made. Now, the whole point of offshore processing is

supposed to be we don’t agree to accept anyone until all these checks are made so  we know what we are getting. Now this is where I think the Prime Minister has  compromised, seriously compromised the ordinary rules to save himself from the  embarrassment that he was in because of that standoff and the fact that this  Australian vessel, the Oceanic Viking, had effectively been taken hostage by people.

ALAN JONES:

Do you understand the public concern out there about the collapse of border  protection policies?

TONY ABBOTT:

Oh yes, Alan. I mean the one thing that Australians expect of their government is  that they will maintain the security of the country. Now look, most of the people who  are trying to get in are desperate people and you can understand them wanting to  come to this place, it is a great country, and why wouldn’t people want to come  here? But Australians have a right to control their borders. We have a right to some  say over who joins us and that’s what the Prime Minister has put at risk.

ALAN JONES:

Barnaby Joyce is under attack for questioning levels of debt, saying from Australia’s  point of view we are getting to the point where we can’t repay it. Now in 2014-15  we’ll have $153 billion of debt, about 10 per cent of GDP, the Government will say  well the United States is up to 85 per cent of GDP with its debt. Britain 92 per cent of  GDP. Is the Government sensitive about its debt levels or do you have to tell  Barnaby Joyce to pull his head in?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I think the fact that they are attacking him so savagely shows that he has the  capacity to wound them. I mean Barnaby Joyce has a great gift for communicating  with people and sure the Government is trying to ridicule him but out there on the  street I think people take Barnaby Joyce a lot more seriously than they take Lindsay  Tanner who is a jumped-up union official, now posing as the guardian of public  finance. Well I mean Lindsay Tanner told us that there would be no major  government spending without a business case. Well come on Lindsay, really and  truly, there was the $17 billion Julia Gillard school hall programme - no business  case there. There’s the $43 billion national broadband network - no business case  for that. So Lindsay Tanner spouts economic responsibility but his own Government  doesn’t practice it.

ALAN JONES:

Just finally you’ve announced that you will implement if you are elected to  government a policy to provide six months paid parental leave. Labor’s 18 weeks  which begins on January 2011 is taxpayer-funded. Employers have welcomed your  initiative so long as they don’t have to pay. Who would pay for your six months  parental leave?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well Alan the Sydney Morning Herald kind of jumped the gun yesterday. We haven’t  made any announcement. I talked about this in my book Battlelines which was  released in the middle of last year and I am very committed to paid parental leave  and a much better scheme than the Mickey Mouse scheme that’s been brought in by  the Government or has been announced by the Government, but as for the details  people will have to wait just a few weeks and then they will have them.

ALAN JONES:

Okay, we’ll talk to you next week and I thank you for your time.

TONY ABBOTT:

Thank you so much Alan.
