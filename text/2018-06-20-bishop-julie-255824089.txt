HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE TO BANGLADESH

Today on World Refugee Day we announce the Australian Government will provide  additional humanitarian assistance to meet the urgent needs of Rohingya people in  Bangladesh.

The UN estimates that more than 900,000 Rohingya are now living in Cox’s Bazar,  including more than 700,000 people who have fled Myanmar since August 2017.

The additional assistance will support the delivery of food, shelter, health and  protection services through the United Nations Refugee Agency, the International  Organisation for Migration and the World Food Program.

Our latest funding package of $18.4 million will contribute to the provision of food for  more than 800,000 people and nutritious supplements for around 139,000 women and  children. It will reinforce shelters, pre-position food supplies and relocate up to  135,000 people at highest risk of landslides. It will also help reunite children with their  families, create safe areas for vulnerable women and children and provide incomes to  around 40,000 women.

With the onset of the monsoon season, conditions in the camps are deteriorating,  there are up to 200,000 people living on land that is vulnerable to landslides and  flooding. The risk of disease outbreak remains high and there are significant concerns  for the safety of women and children.

The additional funding brings Australia’s total humanitarian response to the Rohingya  crisis to $70 million since September 2017.

In 2017-18, Australia provided more than $200 million to assist with displacement  crises in nine countries.
