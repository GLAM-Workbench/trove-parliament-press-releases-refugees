E&OE……………………….…………………………………………………………………

MELISSA DOYLE:

Good morning Mr Abbott. Thanks for your time.

TONY ABBOTT:

Pleasure to be with you, Mel.

MELISSA DOYLE:

Nauru hasn’t ratified the United Nations Refugee Convention. What does that mean to your plan?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, they’re about to. That’s the whole point. You see, Labor has run out of excuses. The fact that Nauru  had not ratified the UN Refugee Convention was one of the reasons why Nauru was supposed to be  unacceptable. Nauru committed yesterday to ratify the convention and of course, Malaysia hasn’t ratified the  convention which really blows up the Prime Minister’s logic on this point.

MELISSA DOYLE:

So, if it’s ratified immediately, do you seriously think the Labor Government might back peddle and look at  reopening it?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I think that the Malaysia deal looks less and less suitable and compared to Malaysia, sending boat  people to Nauru, it’s more humane, it’s more cost-effective and it’s certainly more proven because the  Nauru solution has worked in the past, particularly when coupled with temporary protection visas.

MELISSA DOYLE:

It needs quite a bit of TLC I understand. Is it a big cost to get it functioning again?

TONY ABBOTT:

Mel, look, it’s a lot cheaper than refurbishing or building a centre from scratch. I toured the island on  Sunday and the basic infrastructure is sound, it just needs a bit of cosmetic refurbishment. There’s a good  school, there’s a good police station, no rattans in the police station in Nauru, I have to say, Mel. There’s a  good hospital, the power and the water is good and most importantly, the Government of Nauru and the  people of Nauru want to help out Australia if we need it by taking these boat people.

MELISSA DOYLE:

Both sides of politics seem very adamant that their plan is right in this situation. Do you agree that  Australians, I guess, have got to the point where they really don’t care about the nuts and bolts, they just  want this situation sorted out?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think that’s true and that’s why they’re so frustrated with the Government because the Government  inherited a solution, it created a problem entirely of its own making and then they’ve floundered constantly  in an attempt to deal with it. First of all we had East Timor which was never going to work, then we had  PNG which won’t work because apparently Foreign Minister Rudd won’t help out the Prime Minister here.  Now we’ve got this Malaysian people swap and I just think that the public regard any deal where they take  one of ours, we take five of theirs, where boat people from Australia are going to be tagged in order to  protect them from being caned, it’s just not acceptable.

MELISSA DOYLE:

Right. Can I ask you quickly while we have you, reports today say that you’re about to dump your paid  parental leave policy to give more money to pensioners. Are they correct?

TONY ABBOTT:

Those reports are completely false. I’m all in favour of doing the right thing by pensioners and the best thing  we can do for pensioners is not hit them with a carbon tax, Mel. This carbon tax is going to drive the cost of  living for vulnerable pensioners up and up and up.

MELISSA DOYLE:

Ok, so are you dumping your paid parental leave policy?

TONY ABBOTT:

No I’m not, no I’m not. Look, it’s very, very important that we do the right thing by Australian families. I’d  like to help Australian families, not hurt them. I’d like to help them with a decent paid parental leave  scheme, not hurt them with a carbon tax.

MELISSA DOYLE:

Alright Tony Abbott, thanks very much for your time this morning.
