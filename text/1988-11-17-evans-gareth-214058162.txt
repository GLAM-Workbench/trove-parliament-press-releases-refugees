AUSTRALIA'S FOREIGN AID; OBJECTIVES AND AGENDA

Address by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator

Gareth Evans, to the Ideas Centre Fifteenth Anniversary Dinner,

Sydney, 17 November 1988. .  .  .

The Fifteenth Anniversary of The Ideas Centre - established in

1973 by the Freedom from Hunger Campaign as the first

development education resource of its type and now run as a

Library/Resource Centre by six non-Government aid organisations

- is a particularly appropriate occasion for my first address

on aid issues -as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.

Coming into a portfolio as incredibly diverse and challenging

as this one, where just about every area, including foreign

aid, regularly raises daunting issues of policy and priority, I

am always willing to listen to well-researched and thoughtful

new approaches.

I would like to take the opportunity tonight to sketch out my

initial thoughts on Australian aid policy: where we are at,

and where I think we may be going. I will begin by outlining

some trends in the world economy, which point with worrying

clarity to the reality that global problems of poverty and the

need for development will remain with us well into the next

century. Then I will come to the implications,  as I see them,

of all this for the Australian aid program.

World Economic Trends

From one point of view,  trends in the world economy during 1988

have been quite encouraging. This situation has come as

something of a surprise to many policy-makers, because it is

little more than 12 months ago - in October 1987 - that western

economies were reeling in The wake of the Great Crash. At that

time the cartoonists had stockbrokers falling like confetti

from upper-storey CBD ledges, and many economic forecasters

were saying that a fall in economic growth - and perhaps even a

recession - was very much on the cards.

In the event, there was no recession. The main Western

economies, particularly the American economy, continued to grow

strongly after the stockmarket crash. By mid-1988 most of the

worry about the effects of the crash had evaporated. In

particular the American economy, notwithstanding a few jitters

in recent days, has now been on a sustained upswing for close

on six years, which is the longest period of expansion in

post-War history.

This strong growth in the US economy has been a remarkable

feature of the world economy during the 1980s. It is likely, I

suspect, that historians will come to see it as one of the most

extraordinary aspects of the Reagan era. There are, however,

three aspects of this unusual period of expansion that I think

are worth mentioning in the context of the issues that bring us

together this evening.

The first is .that the sustained boom in the US, and in other

Western countries, has brought very few benefits to developing

countries. The developed and developing nations have

effectively been on separate growth paths. During the 1980s,

despite a few ups and downs, the rich have got richer, while

many of the poorer nations have found the going harder than

e v e r .

The results of slow growth in many developing countries - and

in some cases, actual falls in income per capita - have often

been a deterioration in nutrition standards anti increases in

poverty. For example, tlie Fj, r.s.t__R_epp_rt...of.t he_.Jgo.r.ld....Nut r i  t.i.on

S ituation issued by the United Nations in November 1987, stated

"In the 19 7 0 s there: wo re b ro&ek improveii ionts global I .  y iti

nutrition. Hut since the early 80s, widespread economic

recession and droughts in ÃÂ f . "  r i CA have reversed this tvendL

No further improvement: has occur red overall, and the

situation has worsened in many CiUn t i  < .  " .

Similarly, the World Development Report 1988, issued by the

World Bank in July 1988, observed that:  .

"Poverty in the developing countries is on the rise..

Between 1970 and 1980 the number of people with inadequate

diets in developing countries (excluding China) increased

from 650 million to 730 million. Since 1980 matters have

turned from bad to worse: economic growth rates have

slowed, real wages have dropped, and growth in employment

has faltered in most developing countries."

According to estimates from the International Labour

Organisation, the number of people living in extreme poverty in

developing countries increased from 819 million in 1980 to 881

million in 1985.

The second noteworthy aspect of the sustained boom in the

United States is that it was characterised by a real imbalance

in America between an expansionary fiscal policy on one hand,

and a restrictive monetary policy on the other.  What this

particular mouthful of economic jargon means is that,  as a

consequence more than anything else of US economic policy,

interest rates have risen a round the world, and developing

countries have been plunged into a debt crisis that is still

very much with us.

The third aspect of the boom to note is that it is hard to

believe that it can last. Because Ã¢ÂÂ   of the enormity of the

American budget deficit problem, American living standards have

exceeded the level of national production for some time now:

Americans have, simply, been living beyond their means.

Clearly this situation cannot go on indefinitely. It might last

for another year or so. It might last for another three, or

even five years.  What is certain is that unless America puts

its house in order, sooner or Later tlie rest: of the world will,

become tired of financing the US deficit. When that; time comes

- and it would be premature to read too much into the currency

movements of this week - the American dollar will slide, and

world interest rates will tend to rise..

4

Unfortunately, the likelihood is that all of this will be bad

news for developing countries. Developing countries will

probably lose in two ways: world commodity prices are likely

to fall, and interest rates are likely to again rise. These

trends will make worse their debt burdens, and place new

strains on the fragile political and economic systems in of

those countries. In short, it' is hard to see how world

economic trends during the next three or four years are likely

to help developing countries at all.

The potential human effects of all this are enormous. What

much of the developing world now needs is a return to healthy

economic growth.  Certainly, a return to growth is critically

needed in Africa.  In Asia, the picture is more mixed because

many countries - including Thailand, Malaysia and the Peoples’

Republic of China, as well as the "four tigers" (ROK, Taiwan,

Hong Kong and Singapore) - are either experiencing,  or on the

verge of, their own economic boom.  But in other parts of Asia

- in the Philippines, and of course in Indochina - growth rates

have been low during the 1980s.  It was no doubt countries in

this latter group that the President of the World Bank,  Mr

Conable,  was thinking of when,  in speaking to the World Bank

Meetings in Berlin just two months ago,  he said:

"The stubborn fact of the eighties is that growth has been

inadequate. Poverty is still on the rise and the

environment is poorly protected."

Closer to home,  in Papua New Guinea and the South Pacific,

growth is needed as well. Indeed, in many countries close to

Australia income per head has actually been falling in recent

years. We cannot afford to be relaxed about these trends.

Steady falls in income per capira, in any country, are a

formula for disadvantage and unrest.

what implications do these w o Y M  economic trends hold for

Australia's aid program? The SUl^v Â· . Â· . Ã¢ÂÂ  ;  1  1  rest; in part on how

5

Australia defines its aid objectives, so let me begin by

spelling them out.

First and foremost, Australia's aid effort is founded on the

commitment of the Australian population to basic humanitarian

concerns - the desire to help alleviate poverty, hunger and

suffering wherever it occurs. Within that humanitarian

framework it should come as no surprise for me to say that the

primary objective of Australian aid is to promote growth and

economic development in developing countries. Economic growth

is the surest long-term means "  of reducing and ultimately

eradicating poverty in any given country, as well as freeing up

aid funds for application to more pressing cases of human

disadvantage elsewhere.

While the development objective is the most important,  it is by

no means the only goal of our aid program. Another is to

advance or reinforce Australian political and strategic

obectives, provided that activities carried out within the

aid program are consistent with development goals.

A third main objective is commercial:  as far as possible,

Australian aid activities overseas should be carried out by

Australians, using Australian goods and services.  Some people

are, naturally,  suspicious of what they regard as so-called

"commercialisation" of the aid program. But in practical

terms,  what I have in mind by referring to the commercial

objective of aid is quite simple and sensible. What I want to

see, for example, is Australian wheat (rather than wheat from

anywhere else) being used in our food aid program; Australian

education institutions being involved in our scholarship

programs for overseas students;  and Australian consultants

being encouraged to compete amongst themselves when tendering

for Australian aid projects in places like Indonesia, the

Philippines and Thailand.

There is no reason why any of this should lead to the

undesirable subsidisation of uncompetitive Australian

producers: to take just one obvious example, Australian wheat

6

producers are already amongst the most efficient in the world.

In talking about the commercial goals of the aid program, my

main concern is to ensure that the Australian aid program is

just that: aid provided by Australians.

Moving from objectives to the process of providing aid and

planning aid programs, there is much to be said for maintaining

realistic expectations. No-one should pretend that any aid

program is going to change the world overnight. .

Developing countries in all parts of the world are grappling

with development problems of immense complexity which require

enormous resources. The plain truth is that world aid volumes

are really quite small, at least in comparison to any sensible

measure of needs. "

From one perspective it might be surprising to hear aid funds

being described as lean - after all, world flows of foreign aid

will be about $US50 billion in 1988 (just over $1 billion of

which is provided by Australia) .  This sounds at face value

like a huge amount of money. But it isn't when one considers

the following matters.

.  In the first place, total world expenditure on defence and

armaments in 1988 will be around $US1,000 billion. In

other words, for every dollar spent on foreign aid, $20

will be spent on defence.

.  Aid flows also look relatively small when compared with the

effect on developing countries of developed country

protectionism. The World Bank recently estimated that such

protection reduces developing country national income by

about twice the amount of official development assistance

that is provided.

.  Another way of looking at the issue is to compare foreign

aid flows with the annual investment needs of developing

countries. The total GNP of developing countries will be

around $US2,300 billion in 1988. A reasonable goal would

7

be to invest about 20 p e r .  cent of this amount at home - say

$US450 billion. Bearing in mind that some foreign.  aid

expenditure (such as disaster relief and refugee

expenditure) is not available for investment spending, it

is not too far from the mark to say that foreign aid

usually does not make up more than 10 per cent of the

investment levels in developing countries. Or, to put it

another way, even with foreign aid, developing countries

still must fund about 90 per cent of their investment

programs from their own resources.

. Another useful point of reference, to which I hope the new

US Administration will be more alert than its predecessor,

is the US deficit which, at around $US150 billion, is three

times the world's total foreign aid.

These illustrations make it clear, I hope,  that relative to the

scale of the needs and challenges that developing countries are

facing, foreign aid volumes are modest.  Clearly, foreign aid

can help the growth process, but it can't in most cases be

central to it. The appropriate role for aid is essentially to

be supportive of the efforts of the peoples of developing

countries to tackle their own problems in their own way.

I am not suggesting, however, that the Australian foreign aid

program in any sense is not worthwhile. The point is, rather,

that the Australian aid program needs to be very carefully

focused.

Where long-term development is the principal goal, as it is for

most of our aid program, we need to spend the limited amounts

of foreign aid funds carefully in ways that will best promote

this development.

In some cases,  this will be to support improvements in

education. In other cases,  specific projects will need to be

designed to achieve specific development goals, such as

agricultural development in a particular area. in- other cases

it may be best to work with multilateral development

8

institutions, such as the World Health Organisation, as part of

a broader international effort. In an environment whesre the

needs are so great and the funds relatively few, the worst

approach would be to spread our programs around so thinly as to

make the overall effort ineffective.

Non-Government Organisations

Where do the Australian non-government aid organisations fit

into the Australian aid effort? '

One obvious area, particularly appropriate to stress in the

context of the Ideas Centre, is that of development education.

Australians should not forget that we live in a developing

region, and in that sense, are quite unlike most other major

aid donors in Europe and North America. It creates for us

certain special responsibilities: to reach out to our

neighbours and to try to narrow the economic and social

differences that lie between us. And to do so effectively we

have to encourage an appreciation in the wider Australian

community of the development process, to help ordinary

Australians understand why it is in our interest to narrow

those differences.

This Ideas Centre and the other resource centres established by

Australian Non-Government Organisations (NGOs) are committed to

that process. I commend your efforts and urge you to continue.

But the process of development education is only one small part

of actual and potential NGO activities in Australia. NGOs,

like those represented here tonight,  by their nature are very

good at working with people, especially those particularly

disadvantaged, and on smaller scale local-level projects; and

because they are non-government,  they are good at operating in

areas where official programs are difficult to implement.

NGOs are able to work in places like Kampuchea,  Sudan and

Namibia where for political or other reasons, there is no

9

official program. They are able to focus more effectively on

disadvantaged groups, such as minorities and refugees, because

governments are not alarmed by the modest size of their

activities. Over the years, NGOs have built up specialized

local knowledge in the countries in which they work. Voluntary

aid workers have a well-deserved reputation in many countries

for understanding the people - because they work with them. .

I see it as recognition of these qualities - and as recognition

of a growing maturity and assurance in the agencies themselves

- that NGO activities are attracting more and more government

support, a trend I hope to be able to continue. This applies

to those programs where NGOs and government funds are mixed.

It applies increasingly to NGO activities which are completely

government funded. Multi-year commitments of official funds

and more flexible official guidelines in the allocation of

funds are evidence of the increasing sense of trust by the

government in what the NGOs are doing. It is also an

acknowledgement that we share the same objectives.

The Forward Agenda

Although I have had Ministerial responsibility for aid for less

than three months - and have had one or two other

preoccupations during that period - people have been keen to

wring out of me my agenda for aid policy over the next few

years. It is a little premature to be doing that, and my own

views will undoubtedly refine and develop over time, but let me

offer at least a sketch of the main priorities in the area of

aid policy as I see them at present.

First, I would like to see a steady increase in the volume of

aid, both in dollar terms and as a proportion of G NP.  I am

concerned that we are slipping back, both in absolute terms and

relatively to other major aid donors, and I would certainly

like to see a significant movement in the aid ratio, back

towards at least 0.4 per cent within the next few Budgets.

No-one should underestimate the difficulty of achieving this in

a Budget climate that will continue to be very tight. The

f i g u r e .  '  of

10

$1,147 billion for ODA in the current Forward Estimates

represents only the maintenance of 1988/9 funding in real

terms. Just to maintain aid at 0.36% of GNP would, on present

estimates, require the allocation of another $39 million, and

to increase the proportion to 0.37% will require another $72

million. So it is going to be hard to even maintain the

present ratio, let alone get any major improvement in it, but I

am hopeful that we will be able to at least start moving in

this direction.

My second priority is to encourage other developed nations to

expand their "aid programs as well, working through such

organisations as the Development Assistance Committee of the

OECD. In recent years, some countries - such as Japan and

Italy - have expanded their aid programs relatively quickly,

but in several other countries aid volumes have been falling.

Australia should, as a matter of policy, work to combat

so-called "aid-fatigue". Furthermore, the time is fast

approaching when several of the so-called Newly Industrialising

Economies (NIEs) - especially those in Asia which are running

very large balance of payments surpluses at present - could

initiate their own aid programs.  A number of these countries

received substantial amounts of development assistance in the

1950s and 1960s. It will soon be time for them to set aside

some of their balance of payments surpluses to help other

developing countries which are not as far advanced along in the

development process.

Thirdly, as a necessary complement to aid programs,  we should

continue to press vigorously in the international arena for an

open world trading environment. The vigor with which Australia

is already, pursuing such liberalisation through the Uruguay

Round process stems not only from self-interest,  but also from

the fact that progress in this area would be of great benefit

to many developing countries. We need to urge the governments

of major trading nations such as America and Japan to keep

their domestic markets as open as possible, and we need to work

to ensure that 1992 does not see a so-called "Fortress Europe"

become inward looking behind new trading barriers.

Ã¢ÂÂ¦ )

. ÃÂ *  * ,  ,

Finally, we should support developing countries in a wide range

of ways to improve their own domestic development performance.

As I noted earlier, around 90 per cent of the resources for

investment in developing countries will need to be from within

those countries, so ultimately, it is the decisions taken

within developing countries which are more important than those

taken anywhere else. We need to support better investment

policies, measures to improve law and order, improved

education, well-planned agricultural development programs,

population control activities, and so on. That is, we need to

ensure that the Australian aid efforts are supportive of

improved decision-making processes within recipient countries.  (

This, then, is my preliminary broad agenda for aid policy.

There are many aid issues I have left untouched tonight -

bilateral programs in particular countries, the crisis in

Africa, aid and the environment and so on - but I hope that it

has been useful to touch on the broader picture at this stage.

I also hope that the aims I have outlined dovetail with your

own objectives, and I certainly look forward to continuing to

work with Australia’s NGOs in pursuit of those shared goals.

May I finish by I congratulating the Ideas Centre very

sincerely on its achievements over the past 15 years. The

^  Centre has been one of the forerunners in community education

about development issues. While originally conceived by the

Australian Freedom From Hunger Campaign, the Centre now

provides a very effective link between a number of agencies at

both a State and National level.

The Centre has more recently expanded its operations from being

merely an information service to playing an active role in

reaching even wider into the community. I applaud your efforts

and wish you every success in the future.  Happy 15th

Anniversary.
