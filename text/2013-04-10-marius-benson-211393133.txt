Topic: Asylum seekers



SANDY ALOISI:                     The Gillard Government is under new

pressure today over asylum seeker arrivals  following the appearance of a boat  carrying 66 Sri Lankans on the West  Australian coast. The boat went

undetected until it arrived at the regional  port of Geraldton and that's prompted  claims from the Opposition that the  government has lost all control of our  national borders.

Jason Clare is Home Affairs Minister and is

responsible for border security. He's  speaking here to Marius Benson.

MARIUS BENSON:               Jason Clare, good morning.

JASON CLARE:                      Good morning, Marius.

MARIUS BENSON:               How did this boat make its way - all the  way to Geraldton undetected? Does that  mean something went wrong with Border  Protection?

JASON CLARE:                      I was briefed by Border Protection

Command last night and I've spoken to  them again this morning. Their initial  advice is they believe the vessel travelled  directly from Sri Lanka to Geraldton, which  meant that it travelled in a way which is  south of the main surveillance area, south  of where most of our planes and most of  our patrol boats are focused.

But we'll have more information, we'll

know more about this, when the people  that were on the boat have been

interviewed by DIAC officials as well as  Customs and Border Protection officials.

MARIUS BENSON:               Will you be reviewing that surveillance  given this arrival?

JASON CLARE:                      I've asked Customs to have a look at this.  I've asked them to review the

circumstances of this case. And if changes  are required to the way in which they  patrol, then that should occur. I've got to  say Customs and Border Protection do a  very good job. This is the first case of a  vessel making the mainland in now about  five years.

They do a very good job of intercepting

vessels but this case deserves review to  see if any change in patrolling activities is  required.

MARIUS BENSON:               Colin Barnett, the West Australian Premier,  calls it a serious unprecedented and  unacceptable break of border security. Do  you agree?

JASON CLARE:                      Well, we've been in contact with Mr

Barnett's office yesterday giving him  information on this case. Obviously it's a  concern and I can understand that people  would be concerned about this. We've got  a big coast line and Customs and Border  Protection do a good job of intercepting  vessels based on intelligence and based on  the surveillance work that they do.

We need to interview the people on the

boat to understand what direction they  came in. We saw that sign that said they  were heading for New Zealand. They were  on the boat, we believe, for up to 44 days.  So it seems like a very unusual

circumstance in which people have  travelled directly from Sri Lanka to the  southern coast of Australia, which means  that instead of heading towards Cocos  Island or Christmas Island, which 99.9 per  cent of vessels do, they've travelled in a

southerly direction and arrived at  Geraldton.

MARIUS BENSON:               What will happen to these people now?  Will they be processed in Christmas Island  as is being reported or are they - because  they landed on the mainland - entitled to  be processed on shore?

JASON CLARE:                      No, Marius. My advice is that DIAC intends  to fly these people to Christmas Island and  they'll be screened and processed there.

MARIUS BENSON:               So it's just the same as arriving on

Christmas Island? The mainland gives them  no different entitlement?

JASON CLARE:                      Well, I think that's right. There's - most of  our processing facilities are at Christmas  Island so there's a logic in flying them  there. The other point is they'll be

screened by DIAC officials. If they don't  meet the requirements to be treated as  refugees, then they'll be flown home to Sri  Lanka.

You'll know that last year a lot of Sri

Lankans were flown back to Sri Lanka on  the basis that they didn't meet Australian  requirements to be considered -

international requirements to be  considered  - a refugee and they were

flown home. The same tests will apply to  the individuals on this vessel.

MARIUS BENSON:               In fact, the Sri Lankan High Commissioner  says just send them home. There's no  reason for anyone to be a refugee from Sri  Lanka.

JASON CLARE:                      Well, one of the most successful things

we've done in this wretchedly difficult area  of public policy is say that if you don't meet  the test of being a refugee then you're  flown home. And a lot of people were  flown back to Sri Lanka last year and it  helped us to significantly stem the flow of  boats from Sri Lanka. It's been very  successful.

What I have argued is that the Malaysian

Agreement is something very similar. A lot  of people come to Australia via

Afghanistan or Iran. It's very difficult to fly  people back to Afghanistan or Iran but you  can fly them halfway back by sending  people back to Malaysia. It's an important  part of a regional solution to stop people  risking their lives and getting onto boats.

MARIUS BENSON:               Jason Clare, thank you very much.

JASON CLARE:                      Thanks very much, Marius.
