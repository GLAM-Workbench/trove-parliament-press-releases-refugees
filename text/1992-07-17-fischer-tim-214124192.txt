TIM FISCHER PROMISES SEVEN BILLION DOT JAR PLUS 'JOBS BACK' BOOST

(EXCERPTS FROM A SPEECH GIVEN BY TIM FISCHER MP TO THE ANNUAL CONFERENCE  OF THE QUEENSLAND NATIONAL PARTY - FRIDAY 17 JULY 1992).

Net benefits flowing from the Federal Coalition's 'Fightback!'  package  (taking into account the cost of GST) are:-* Agriculture: over $1 billion * Mining: nearly $700 million

* Manufacturing: almost $5.5 billion

The Coalition will deliver a comprehensive 'Jobsback strategy'  which will  include:Â­

* Abolition of seven taxes including Wholesale Sales Tax, all petrol  and diesel Fuel Excise and all Payroll Tax.

* Deliver largest income tax cuts in our nation's history (an average  of 30%).

* Create a Department of Sustainable Development to centralise decision making on major development projects. (The aim being to  decide on projects within 12 months). '

* Vastly improve tax write offs of plant and equipment to encourage  investment in the latest technology and the meeting of best  international practice standards.

* Re-categorise drought status as a national disaster and ensure  relevant assistance to those in drought affected areas.

* Deliver an enormous boost to the tourism industry. No GST will be  payable on out or inbound travel products and whilst GST will be  payable on goods and services consumed by tourists they will no  longer have to pay Sales Tax, Fuel Excise etc.

* Lift an enormous taxation weight off the productive sector.

* Ensure that there are no extraordinary tariff cuts.

Whilst these elements will completely change the way we think about our  industries and change our views about international competitiveness to  fully capitalise on these changes we must also have industrial relations  reform.

In addition, the 'Fightback!'  Package includes:-* Major improvements to education and training including spending an  extra $3 billion. Austudy payments will be boosted by 6%.

* Requiring future migrants to contribute to the nation's tax base  .  before they draw social security benefits, the exception being .  migrants who qualify for refugee or humanitarian status. ENDS 17 July 1992
