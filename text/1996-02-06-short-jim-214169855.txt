COALITION’S PROUD IMMIGRATION AND  MULTICULTURAL1SM RECORD

The record of the Liberal National Party Coalition in immigration and ethnic affairs is  without parallel.

The Labor Party, and in particular Paul Keating, has taken every opportunity to rewrite  the history of Australian immigration in a dishonest and shameless attempt to denigrate  the superb record of the Coalition.

This has been part of a campaign to enhance what could only be described at best as  Labor’s superficial and expedient interest in immigration and ethnic affairs, and at worst  blatant manipulation of Australia’s multicultural communities for base political  advantage.

The major initiatives in the establishment of multicultural policies came from the Fraser  Coalition Government’s adoption of a wide range of new initiatives recommended in the  Galbally Report on migrant settlement services in 1978, including: Ã¢ÂÂ¢ comprehensive orientation programmes for new arrivals;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ English language instruction for new arrivals; Ã¢ÂÂ¢ multicultural education programmes in schools; Ã¢ÂÂ¢ significant boosts to child migration education programmes; Ã¢ÂÂ¢ the extension of specialist welfare schemes to ethnic groups Â· including grant-in-aid

social workers; Ã¢ÂÂ¢ the development of a systematic network of Migrant Resource Centres; Ã¢ÂÂ¢ the establishment of the Australian Institute of Multicultural Affairs (which was  subsequently abolished by the Hawke Labor Government);

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ the extension of ethnic radio services; and Ã¢ÂÂ¢ the establishment of the Special Broadcasting Service (SBS).

Many of these programs continue today to underpin Australia’s multicult ural policies.

In the area of immigration, it was the Coalition Government of Prime Minister Harold  Holt that in 1966 that effectively abolished the obnoxious White Australia Policy (which  had been progressively weakened by the preceding Menzies government) and introduced

, a lion-discriminatory policy based on an inclusive and totally anti-racist philosophy for  the first time in Australia’s history since Federation,

The Whitlam Labor government in the early 1970s slashed the immigration intake,  abolished the Department of Immigration, and in 1974, after the Vietnam war had  concluded for Australia, refused to grant asylum to the thousands of people in that  country who sought entry to Australia.

The Fraser Coalition Government’s decision to accept the Vietnamese “boat people” in  late 1977 under a newly announced comprehensive refugee policy was taken despite  strident opposition from the Labor Party, of which Paul Keating was a senior member,  and sections of the trade union movement, including (lie then ACTU President and

subsequent Labor Prime Minister, Bob Hawke.

'Hie Coalition is as committed today to a multicultural Australia as it was in the 1970s  and early 1980s. That commitment is sincere and principled, unlike Labor, whose  conversion to multiculturalism was always, and remains still, predicated not by a genuine  concern for ethnic Australia, but by a desperate and cynical attempt to gamer votes.
