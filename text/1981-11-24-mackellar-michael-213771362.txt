GRANTS FOR HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

The Minister for Health, the Hon. Michael MacKellar,

today announced details of twelve grants totalling $455 570

awarded for the research and development of health services in

Australia.

Mr MacKellar said the grants were available for reÂ­

search into the efficiency and effectiveness of health care deÂ­

livery and for the development of improved health services.

The awards include $266 817 for four continuing grants

and $188 753 for eight new projects approved by the Minister.

Funding for the third year of operation of the National

Perinatal Statistics Unit is included in the continuing grants.

The Unit was established in October 1979 to develop and maintain

a national monitoring system for birth defects, and has started

publication of a regular quarterly report series.

The effectiveness of programs for teaching self-help

skills in reducing the number of visits to doctors and the use

of medicines for common chronic complaints is being assessed under

an ongoing grant to the University of Western Australia. The selfÂ­

management of insomnia will now be tested following the examinÂ­

ation of headache during the past year.

Mr MacKellar said he was pleased to be able to announce

among the new grants an award to Dr J. Cummine,  at the Westmead

Centre Hospital, for a study in association with the Sub-Normal

Children's Welfare Association of the rehabilitation needs of inÂ­

tellectually handicapped children in this International Year of

Disabled Persons.

A further two grants are for research into health

outcome measures.
