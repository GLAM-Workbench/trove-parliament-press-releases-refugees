BUDGET 2002-2003

Media Release

SENATOR THE HON. CHRISTOPHER ELLISON

Minister for Justice and Customs

Senator for Western Australia

14 May 2002

STRONG FOCUS ON CUSTOMS

An extra $218.1 million over four years will provide Customs with more Coastwatch flights around Australia, more crew for its marine fleet and more shipping container x-ray machines as well as contributing to Australia’s counter-terrorism capabilities, the Minister for Justice and Customs, Senator Chris Ellison, said today.

“The Government’s Budget funding for Customs is another strong sign of its commitment to delivering on its Protecting Our Borders election commitments and the priority this Government gives to the security and sovereignty of Australia’s borders,” Senator Ellison said.

The new funding will also enable Customs to trial high frequency surface wave radar technology in Australia’s north for civil maritime surveillance purposes, and will give Customs access to international airline computer reservation lists to improve counter-terrorism measures.

“The funds allocated in the 2002-03 Budget demonstrates this Government’s commitment to ensuring Australia’s borders are protected and that we are serious about defending Australia against terrorist attacks,” Senator Ellison said.

The measures include:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ An additional $77.4 million over four years to double the number of at-sea days for Customs’ fleet of eight vessels to 2400 annually.  Providing additional staff for the vessels to enhance maritime surveillance and response capability (see Fact Sheet 3);

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ $28.5 million over three years to increase annual Coastwatch surveillance hours. The additional 1600 hours allowing for the maintenance of surveillance in north-west Australia as well as raising the capacity to respond to other taskings from law enforcement and government agencies (See Fact Sheet 3);

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ An additional $39.8 million over four years expanding the container x-ray procurement program to Brisbane and Fremantle, and $9.2 million over four years to purchase additional pallet x-ray machines.  This improves our capacity to detect prohibited goods, including illicit drugs, that may be illegally transported via shipping consignments (See Fact Sheet 3);

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ An extra $42.3 million over four years to obtain access to international airlines reservation systems to allow better screening of arriving and departing passengers for counter terrorism purposes (See Fact Sheet 2);

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ An additional $12.8 million over four years to trial, in conjunction with Defence, High Frequency Surface Wave Radar technology to increase surveillance coverage beyond capabilities of conventional microwave radar (See Fact Sheet 3); and

Page 2

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ $8.1 million over four years to improve communications between airborne aircraft and the Coastwatch National Surveillance Centre (See Fact Sheet 3).

“These measures represent a significant increase in muscle-power at the Australian border,” Senator Ellison said.  “They provide better technology, more staff, and more operational hours at our border.

“The Protecting Our Borders program will help control illegal movement of people and goods while at the same time ensuring law-abiding citizens and traders suffer minimal disruption as they go about their business at the border.”

THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL'S PORTFOLIO

COUNTER-TERRORISM MEASURES

The Howard Government is committed to protecting Australians and Australian interests from the devastating effects of terrorism. It has committed $426.6 million over the next four years for a raft of measures to safeguard our nation.

The Government reacted swiftly to the terrorist attacks on the United States last year and announced measures to strengthen our already well-coordinated and well-practiced national security arrangements.

New measures in this Budget include upgrading counter-terrorist capabilities at all major airports, engaging and training more air security officers, and increasing the number of explosive-detection dogs at airports.

ENHANCED AVIATION SECURITY

Budget 2002-03 provides $128.5 million over four years to provide greater deterrence against potential attacks on Australian airports and the aviation industry, building on those security measures implemented by the Government after the September 11 terrorist attacks.

Advanced First Response

As previously announced, counter-terrorism capabilities will be upgraded at major and capital city airports in Australia. Currently, the Australian Protective Service (APS) provides Counter Terrorist First Response (CTFR) services at eight airports in Adelaide, Brisbane, Cairns, Coolangatta, Darwin, Melbourne, Perth and Sydney. The number of APS personnel will be expanded at each of these locations and a similar presence will also be established at Alice Springs, Canberra and Hobart airports. In addition, the CTFR capabilities at all these airports will be upgraded to Advanced First Response level. Sydney and Melbourne airports already have an Advanced First Response capability.

Advanced First Response means APS personnel will receive self-loading pistols (instead of the current use of revolvers), upgraded bomb appraisal equipment, and chemical, biological and radiological protective equipment. Those officers will also be required to achieve higher levels of tactical training, skills and fitness.

Through the APS, there will be a greater uniformed security presence at airports to maintain the integrity of passenger terminals, cargo and restricted areas; provide rapid response capabilities; and assist with the development of security policies and contingency plans.

More than 150 officers will be added to the ranks of specially-trained APS personnel at Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, Perth, Canberra, Darwin, Hobart, Cairns, Brisbane, Coolangatta and Alice Springs airports.

Air Security Officers

The Air Security Officer program, which began at the end of last year, will be bolstered with funding for the recruitment of another 90 officers. The program covertly places specially trained officers to deal with in-flight terrorist threats, providing increased protection for the aviation industry and greater reassurance for the travelling public.

By the end of August, 110 air security officers will be trained and able to cover domestic and international flights. They will operate on flights from airports in Adelaide, Alice Springs, Brisbane, Canberra, Cairns, Darwin, Gold Coast, Melbourne, Perth and Sydney.

Explosive-detection dogs

To complement the upgraded physical security at airports, the number of explosive -detection dog teams will be increased from seven to twelve.

Budget 2002-03 will provide $4.4 million over four years to increase the number of teams - a team being one dog and one handler -already based at Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane airports and to expand the program to include Canberra and Perth airports.

The Australian Protective Service, in conjunction with the Department of Transport and Regional Services, will manage the teams.

INCIDENT RESPONSE CAPABILITY

Emergency Management Australia (EMA) receives a $17.8 million boost over four years for specialised equipment and training for agencies and officers who first respond to chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear and explosive incidents. This is part of the cross-portfolio allocation of $150.2 million over four years to enhance incident response capability.

EMA is a division of the Attorney-General’s Department and is dedicated to promoting a national approach to emergency management in Australia. The agency works with States and Territories in the areas of prevention, preparedness, response and recovery for all types of disasters affecting communities and the environment.

While funding and capability will be controlled by the EMA, the new equipment will be located in the States and Territories where it will be on-hand for response to any chemical, biological and radiological incidents. There will be consultation with the States and Territories to ensure the most appropriate equipment is acquired.

In addition, further training for emergency service personnel in the States and Territories will be conducted, as these personnel will be the first to attend the scene of an incident.

IMPROVING COUNTER-TERRORISM COORDINATION

The 2002-03 Budget includes an extra $14.4 million over four years to enable the Protective Security Coordination Centre (PSCC) in the Attorney-General’s Department to improve the coordination and management of Australia’s counter-terrorism arrangements.

The PSCC is the primary agency responsible for coordinating and managing the Commonwealth’s protective security and counter-terrorism arrangements.

In line with the initiatives agreed at the 5 April 2002 Leaders’ Summit on Terrorism and Multi-Jurisdictional Crime, the PSCC will also assume a greater role in coordinating all Commonwealth, State and Territory counter-terrorism resources responding to national terrorist situations.

The PSCC will also provide greater support to the National Counter-Terrorism Committee (formerly the Standing Advisory Committee on Commonwealth/State Cooperation for Protection Against Violence). This will include the administration and management of counter-terrorism equipment procurement, training and exercise programs, the on-going review of national counter-terrorism policy, and the development of improved mechanisms for greater cooperation between the Commonwealth, States and Territories.

The PSCC will also maintain a dedicated security coordination and response management facility known as the Watch Office. Under the National Anti-Terrorist Plan (NATP), the Watch Office performs a critical role in the national crisis management arrangements which operate in the event of a terrorist incident. The Watch Office also provides the Commonwealth with the daily ability to deliver after-hours coordination of dignitary protection and other protective security arrangements.

IMPROVED DATA ACCESS FOR BORDER CONTROL AGENCIES

The September 11 attacks have increased the need for coordinated national counter-terrorism resources to ensure a quick and effective response to any threats.

The Government has allocated $42.3 million over four years to enable the Australian Customs Service to access international airline computer reservation systems to assist Australia’s counter-terrorism measures.

This measure will strengthen the ability of Customs to regulate the movement of people and goods across borders and screen arriving and departing passengers for possible terrorist situations and other threats to border integrity.

The funding will cover system infrastructure and connection devices, licence and ongoing fees associated with the system and additional Customs staff required to develop and operate the system and analyse passenger data.

Attorney-General’s Department and ASIO will work with Defence and the National Office for the Information Economy (NOIE) to create a secure and trusted electronic operating environment for the public and private sectors.

The agencies will develop systems to protect, detect and respond to any attacks directed against Australia’s National Information Infrastructure (NII).

The strategy responds to a growing demand from the public and private sectors, international law enforcement agencies and the general community to e-security incidents by expanding NII incident analysis and response capability.

THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL'S PORTFOLIO

PROTECTING OUR BORDERS

Delivering on its ‘Protecting Our Borders’ election commitments, the 2002-2003 Budget provides for an additional $177.3 million over four years to improve Australia’s capacity to protect its borders. This includes $1.5 million in funding to help Indonesia patrol its coastline, which is serving as a haven for people smugglers.

The extra funding will enhance Australia’s ability to detect unauthorised arrivals, drug smugglers, illegal firearms, illegal fishing and a range of other border threats. It also allows Customs to access international airlines’ computer reservations to provide better screening of arriving and departing passengers, thus improving our counter-terrorism capability.

DOUBLING CUSTOMS’ NATIONAL MARINE UNIT CAPACITY

Customs will receive an extra $77.4 million over four years to double its National Marine Unit surveillance and response capability.

Customs has a fleet of eight 35-metre Bay Class vessels that operate for a total of 1200 sea days per year, or 150 sea days per vessel per year. With the boost in funding, the fleet’s capacity will be doubled to 2400 sea days per year, or 300 sea days per vessel per year.

This additional capacity will allow Customs vessels, some of which have been operating in north western Australia to support operations relating to Unauthorised Boat Arrivals, to respond effectively to requests from other law enforcement and government agencies around Australia.

The funding will also provide for additional sea-going crew and support staff as well as vessel running costs. A recruitment and training campaign is currently underway to increase the number of sea-going crew from 90 to 168. Most of the additional crew will be in place by June 2002.

ADDITIONAL CONTAINER X-RAY MACHINES

Customs will receive an additional $39.8 million over four years to expand its container x-ray procurement program to the ports of Brisbane and Fremantle. This builds on the funding already provided under the Tough on Drugs program, which provides for the capital cost of container x-ray facilities in both Sydney and Melbourne.

Container x-rays improve capacity to detect prohibited goods, including illicit drugs and illegal firearms that may be illegally shipped in containers. They also help identify non-compliance with import and export requirements.

Each facility will have the capacity to x-ray up to 100 containers per day and staff can provide follow-on physical examination when required of both import and export cargo. A 12-metre container will take approximately 10 minutes to scan, providing faster cargo examination.

In the 2002-03 Budget, the Government is providing $9.2 million over four years to purchase additional pallet x-ray machines.

Pallet x-rays are used to screen cargo containers without requiring the contents to be completely unpacked. They reduce the need for physical examination, providing faster and more efficient cargo examination and greater coverage of sea cargo entering and leaving Australia.

Customs has already purchased pallet x-ray machines that will work in conjunction with container x-ray facilities in Sydney and Melbourne.

INCREASED COASTWATCH SURVEILLANCE

Customs will receive $28.5 million over three years to increase annual Coastwatch surveillance hours. This will allow Customs Coastwatch Dash-8 aircraft to fly an additional 1600 flying hours per year.

This funding follows the establishment last year of Customs Operation Eddington to provide surveillance operations for unauthorised boat arrivals in northern Australia. Operation Eddington operates in support of Defence’s Operation Relex. It has required redeployment of some Coastwatch surveillance aircraft and air crew, traditionally based on the east coast, to supplement operations out of Darwin and Broome.

The additional funding will allow Coastwatch to resume key parts of its standing national surveillance program which were reduced following the establishment of Operation Eddington. It means Coastwatch will increase its capacity to respond effectively to requests for assistance from other law enforcement and Government agencies.

HIGH FREQUENCY SURFACE WAVE RADAR

Customs will receive an extra $12.8 million over four years to trial, in conjunction with Defence, High Frequency Surface Wave Radar (HFSWR) technology to increase surveillance coverage beyond capabilities of conventional microwave radar. This will significantly increase surveillance coverage of offshore high threat approaches to Australia.

HFSWR is a long-range/wide-area radar system that can detect targets beyond the horizon. The Australian version of HFSWR is a derivative of the Jindalee (over-the-horizon radar) research and has the potential to provide detection and tracking of surface vessels and aircraft to 300 kilometres and over an arc of 90 degrees.
