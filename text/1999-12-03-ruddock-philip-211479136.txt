Nation-Wide Public Consultations 
on Australia's Immigration Program Commence

MPS 171/99

Â

The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock, 
today marked the start of his annual national consultations on the Government's 
migration and humanitarian programs with the release of a package detailing 
many facets of immigration and population movement.

Â

Mr Ruddock said a nation-wide series of public meetings will be held 
again this financial year as part of the consultations on the Government's 
migration and humanitarian programs.

Â

To mark the launch, he released a package of four documents providing 
an in-depth look at Australia's migration program as well as the consultation's 
discussion paper.

Â

"These documents are a valuable resource to ensure an educated, 
informed discussion on our population directions and on our immigration 
and humanitarian program," Mr Ruddock said.

Â

Mr Ruddock launched the documents at the first round of consultations 
in Melbourne.

"These public meetings are consistent with the Government's promise 
to administer Australia's immigration program in an open and accountable 
manner.

Â

"They will provide an ideal opportunity for all Australians to 
contribute their thoughts, ideas and comments."

Â

"During the consultation process I will be meeting representatives 
from more than 2,000 groups including State, Territory and local governments, 
business and industry groups, unions, environmental bodies, welfare 
organisations, church groups, and representatives of Australia's migrant 
communities.

Â

"Their views on the migration and settlement process are vitally 
important."

Â

Mr Ruddock said his consultation program helped ensure Australia was 
eliciting the expertise it needed, and that the community could be confident 
it was getting a migration program that would benefit the nation.

Â

Mr Ruddock said 35,000 skilled migrant visas 
were is  sued 
during the 1998-99 financial year.

Â

"Skilled migrants represent 52 per cent of Australia's total 
migrant intake for the year - up from 23 per cent in 1996-97.

Â

"These figures are the best proof that changes made by this Government 
to Australia's migration program are successfully attracting highly 
skilled migrants - migrants who generate enormous benefits for the Australian 
community."

INFORMATION SHEET

New settlers have their say 
- how immigrants fare over the early years of settlement

Â

The Longitudinal Survey of Immigrants to Australia (LSIA) provides 
an intriguing first hand look at the challenges facing new immigrants, 
and how they deal with them. The study follows 5000 new settlers for 
the first five years in Australia, the most comprehensive survey of 
immigrants ever undertaken in this country. A CD-ROM on the full data 
from the survey will be released early next year.

Â

The Atlas of the Australian 
People - National Overview

Â

With some 23 percent of Australia's population overseas-born, this 
report, based on information gathered in the 1996 Census, provides a 
valuable insight into our community. It includes an analysis of socio-economic 
characteristics of overseas-born, Australian-born and the Aboriginal and 
Torres Strait Islander population. As the authors note, 7he rate of 
arrival and the composition of the incoming population itself has had 
an enormous impact on our evolving national character. Australian society 
is unabashedly multicultural." It is also available on CD-ROM.

Â

Community Profiles: Italy and 
Viet Nam born

Â

The first two in a set of 20 reports on the largest overseas-born communities 
in Australia, based on country of birth, these reports contain a broad 
range of demographic and socio-economic statistical information. The 
profiles show that more recent arrivals tend to be more skilled on average 
than longer-standing groups. Many community groups are young and highly 
educated, and are successful in finding employment in highly skilled 
professions. On the other hand, many of our older communities, including 
Italians, arrived with little or no formal educations and worked in 
blue-collar occupations. Some of our recent communities are in a similar 
situation, as many have arrived as refugees. In both cases, the profiles 
show the second generation is achieving much improved educational qualifications 
and labour market performance.

Â

Population Flows

Â

Population Flows offers a fascinating look at the ebbs and flows of 
Australian's population.

Population Flows maps who lives here, who comes 
here, and who leaves.

The report shows, for instance, that Australia 
gained nearly twice as many   skilled people through immigration than it lost though emigration 
in 1998-99.

It analyses the labour market and demographic impact of these flows 
of people at national and state level.
