Second Man Removed To Afghanistan Under Returns  Agreement

Another Afghan man has been sent home involuntarily under the returns agreement  between Australia and Afghanistan.

The man, who originally arrived in Australia by airplane in 2010, returned late yesterday on  a commercial flight.

He was the second person removed under the returns agreement between Australia,  Afghanistan and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.

The Afghan man was found not to be a refugee, which was upheld on review at the Refugee  Review Tribunal, and at further judicial review.

The Government removed the first Afghan under this agreement - who had also failed in his  claim for a Protection Visa - late last month.

People returned involuntarily do not have access to reintegration assistance.
