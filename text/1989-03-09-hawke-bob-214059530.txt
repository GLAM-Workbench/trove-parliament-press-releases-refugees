TRANSCRIPT OF NEWS CONFERENCE, PARLIAMENT HOUSE, 9 MARCH  1989

E & ÃÂ E - PROOF ONLY

JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke what were the factors that caused ...  to state your concerns about the Protocols?

PM: ... let me make clear what the Protocol 1 of the Geneva  Convention does. It relates to the treatment of civilians  and civilian targets in war time and it's designed to  prevent attacks on them. The decision to sign it was taken  by the previous Liberal Government.  This Government took a  decision in principle to ratify some time ago but we delayed

a final decision pending very extensive consultations with  our friends in the United States. Six NATO countries have  already ratified it and others are expected to. We expect  to make an explanatory statement at the time of ratification

to clear up any possible residual problems on  interoperability. Our military advisers are confident,  lfm  advised,  that Australia's adherence to the Protocol will not  adversely effect interoperability and they strongly endorse

ratification. I think if you consider each of those points  you'll see why we've adopted the position we have.

JOURNALIST: What do they mean by interoperability?

PM: What do they mean by interoperability? It's not a  complex - I mean I must confess Milton that at times when we  get into the area of military strategic discussion I have to  think a bit about some of the terms,  they get rather  esoteric. But interoperability is not a difficult one,  it  doesn't come into that category. It means the way in which

the forces of one type of the alliance actually operate in  war with another.

JOURNALIST: Well isn't that a matter of major concern to  Australia? Â·

PM: If it hadn't been a matter of major concern as to the  possible impact upon it then we wouldn't have had all these  discussions. I guess if it was a matter of such concern  that it made it questionable as to whether you could have

effective interoperability I guess 6 NATO countries wouldn't  have signed. I guess if it had been a fact that it would  have adverse impacts on interoperability our Defence Force

people wouldn't have been in favour of signing it. They  are.

JOURNALIST: inaudible

- 2-

PM: There's not much more in that one is there.

JOURNALIST: Are you concerned at all Mr Hawke about the way  your Minister, Mr Punch, has handled the Sydney Airport  issue,  and do you think that there has been at least some  scope for improvement in his performance?

PM: No the only criticism I would have is of what would've  appeared at one stage in public, not in the Parliament, to  have been a pre-emption of a consideration by the Cabinet of  all the options. Now that was the only criticism and I've  mentioned that to him as I thought it was not wise to have

conveyed an impression that all the options wouldn't be on  the table. But apart from that no I have no reason to  question his performance. I have confidence in him. I  thought he handled himself very well in Parliament  yesterday.

JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke what is you view on third runway -PM: It will be expressed in the Cabinet.

JOURNALIST: Will that decision be finalised today?

PM: I don't know whether it will be finalised today  Michelle. It is an extremely - I mean there won't be any  argument about this, it's an extremely complex issue. It's  one which I want to allow to all my Ministers a full

opportunity for discussion and consideration. If I judged  that there hasn't been enough time by the end of this  evening - when we will be considering it tonight in the  Cabinet - then more time will be given. But I can assure  you and the Australian public that the decision will be made

in the very near future. If it's not made this evening it  will be made within the week.

JOURNALIST: ... that the Government here is driven by  politics rather than considerations of national interest?

PM: I repudiate it completely. It is an obscenity of an  argument because with a thing like this there is no way I -  or would I allow any of my Ministers - to make a decision  simply on political grounds. I mean all decisions that

governments make - it would be dishonest to say that some  elements of political considerations don't come into it - of  course they will. But as far as I'm concerned the decision  will be made on the basis of what is best for this country

and I can assure you that in regard to this issue those who  would seek to paint it as one which is made simply in terms  of which decision offends the least people or gets the most  kudos from others, are completely on the wrong runway.

JOURNALIST: Was it not unwise to put Mr Punch in that job?

- 3-

PM: .  Of course it was not unwise to put him in that job. I  was conscious when I was allocating the portfolios that his  interests and involvement in this area - and I referred to  it at the time - and indicated that all these things had to

be handled according to their merits. Now the fact that he-  has a view will have nothing to do with the decision of the  Cabinet ... I think Laurie that you appreciate the political  realities of knowing the make-up of the Cabinet. I don't

think you would believe that the Cabinet and the people in  the Cabinet would have their position determined by the  attitude of Mr Punch.

JOURNALIST: ... vested interest than a view?

PM: Well he obviously has an interest from his own  particular point of view as a member ... It would be stupid  to deny that.  But this submission has been prepared by and  will be presented to the Cabinet by Mr Willis. As a member

of the portfolio Mr Punch will be in the Cabinet but he will  not be making a decision on this. Mr Willis has the  carriage of it in the Cabinet.

JOURNALIST: Is the third runway still an option?

PM: Well let me put it this way. It is an option which I  insisted - there was no problem about insisting on it -  we've accepted that that's the way it had to be. But I want  every option and the arguments for and against before the

Cabinet.  There is no way that this matter will be decided  on the basis of simply saying "well someone has a preference  for one and doesn't like the other so only the one will be  there". All the options,  as I say, with all the pros and

cons will be there.

JOURNALIST: Do you believe Badgerys Creek can be built in  four years or three years or whatever ...?

PM: If you have some doubt let there be no doubt as to  what's been said. No-one is saying that from the point of  decision that Badgerys Creek could be built in three years.   No-one is or has said that. It could not be.

JOURNALIST: You'd be well aware of the history of the whole  thing -PM: But make it ... also clear nor could the third runway.

JOURNALIST: But you'd be well aware of the history of the  whole episode going back at least to the Whitlam Government  in considering -PM: And before,  yes.

JOURNALIST: Would you concede that this decision should've  been made actually a long time ago?

- 4-

ÃÂ¡ÃÂÃÂ¯ .It should've been made before this Government came into  office.  Let it be said this is the first government which  has made a relevant decision in respect of the expansion of  airport facilities to meet the needs of Sydney. That is by

the decision that we have taken and which we've already  acted upon to acquire land at Badgerys Creek.  A decision  like that should've been taken before hand. Because  remember this,  it seems to be overlooked and it certainly

was overlooked in the discussion and debate and observations  of the Parliament yesterday, no-one,  no-one involved in this  discussion and debate is arguing that you will not need to  have Badgerys Creek. The arguments are simply whether it is

a third runway plus Badgerys Creek at some time.  It was  this Government which was the first and should've been done  before hand by previous governments,  to take some steps to  acquire the additional land for additional capacity.  Because no-one and I repeat no-one is arguing that Badgerys

Creek will not at some stage have to be built. It will.

JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke if neither of those options can be  done quickly is there anything that you can do in the  interim .  .  .  ?

PM: Yes there are some things that will be done and they'll  be announced.

JOURNALIST: Can Sydney afford - and indeed Australia - afford the economic cost of waiting until Badgerys Creek is  ready when a third runway at Sydney must be a quicker  option?

PM: Well on what do you base that? There is no evidence  whatsoever.  I mean that's nice to say and I don't intend to  be ... in saying this. But one of the unfortunate things in  this discussion has been the mindless,  uninformed

assumptions that are made by many people, and that's on both  sides of the argument.  The mindlessness hasn't been  confined to one side. Now there is no evidence available to  support the assumption that the third runway can be built  quicker than a facility at Badgerys Creek. Because you've  got to take into account the period - and quite considerable  period - that would be involved in an environmental impact

statement in regard to a third runway at Kingsford-Smith. I  repeat there is no basis for the assumption which seems to  be explicit or implicit in so many positions on this.  The  third runway at Kingsford-Smith, click you fingers, there it

is, Badgerys Creek much longer.  It's not accurate.

JOURNALIST: Can the Government afford to fast track  Badgerys Creek?

PM: There are ways, I believe, in which this would be capable of being done. But it involves questions not only  of government but there's a limit to how far obviously I can  go in all of this discussion. I mean I don't want to be not

forthcoming in regard to your questions.  As you can see I  have been responding to your questions. But an amount of

(PM .cont)  the detail which is involved in that particular  question but I'm not prepared to go to it in any detail. But let me simply say this in regard to fast tracking,  that's one element that's on the table.

JOURNALIST: On another subject Prime Minister. What's the  Government going to do about militant Muslims that are  threatening Australians in Australia?

PM: The position - let me repeat the position Laurie.  If  any Australian citizen or group of Australian citizens  infringes the law in terms of their atttides to others in  the position of my Government - and I'm sure it would be the  postion of the State Governments - and it does seem to have

arisen more particularly in Sydney, I'm sure it would be the  attitide of Mr Greiner and his Government,  but if any  citizen or group of citizens infringes the law then the law  should take its course. You have the difficult and fine

line position which I think you'll appreciate Laurie - and  this is in the sense at the heart of the Rushdie affair  itself - that what distinguishes our country from others,  including Iran for that matter,  is our total commitment to

the right of free expression, and that expression of oral  and written, provided as I say it's not infringing the law.  Now provided that individual groups express their view on  this issue without infringing the law then an essential part

of our position is ... that that should be allowed.

JOURNALIST: What about the comments of Mr Javed Chaudry  last night? How do you react to those -PM: Well I must say I was offended by them, reading them  this morning. It would be a question however of the law.  Simply because I'm offended by what someone says is not a  basis for action. After all, if that was the case, half of  you wouldn't be here because you've offended me at times.  But to be offended is not a cause for legal action. I mean  God where would we finish up?

JOURNALIST: Is there clause to protect the booksellers who  have been threatened by ....

PM: Well look Laurie,  I mean there's obviously the legal  question involved here.  I can't pretend just standing here  at the forum in answer to a very legitimate question that  you put, to answer whether there has been an infringement of

law, it ought to be looked at. If there is an infringement  of law, action ought to be taken.

JOURNALIST: But there has been a threat.  Are you going to

- 6-

PM: ..Well obviously in the area involved here it is more  probably a matter of State jurisdiction and that's not said  to avoid the issue. If there is any infringement of a  Federal law which could involve Federal action, then that

should be taken. i'll obviously, when these things happen,  I get reports coming to me. There'll be a report to me  today no doubt and I can say to you quite clearly, if I was

advised that there is an infringement of Federal law then I  would expect action to be taken. Similarly, Laurie, I would  expect that if there is an infringement of a State law, I  would expect.action to be taken.  We are in this area of

fine line where expressions of view are not necessarily an  infringement of the law. I mean probably you - it may not  have happened in your case - but you at times may have said  things which of course .... thump you in the bloody nose.

I'd be surprised if they had because you're such a  reasonable bloke in what you say. But threats can be made  which don't necessarily involve a breaking of the law. But  I repeat, because this is a matter of fundamental

importance,  the right of Australians themselves to have, to  be able to speak freely, to write freely and to disseminate  freely. I mean that is something that I regard as  fundamental.  If anything has happened against the law in

that respect then I would want action to be taken.

JOURNALIST: Just looking beyond the law for a moment to the  immigration program are you concerned at all that you may be  recruiting people to come to this country who have very very  different sets of values and that this may pose some sort of  problem?

PM: Well the question of different sets of values of course  of itself is a difficult thing because this country is not  going to become one under this Government in which we are  demanding adherence to one set of values. I mean,  the  majority of people in this country would be adherents to the

Judean-Christian ethic and practice and beliefs. A very  significant proportion of this country have either none orÂ·  different so we are not going to have uniformity. The  critical test Paul is this, that if there was an evidence of

recruitment of people committed to the processes of  violence, then that would not be acceptable. If I had such  evidence I would require action to be taken to see that that  sort was stopped.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister would you adopt Mr Saunderson's  suggestion that in anticipation of any ruling by the ABC  next week about transition legislation to the Bond network?

PM: No this Government hasn't operated on the basis of  moving legislation following speeches made by backbenchers.  That's not the way we go about forming legislation.

JOURNALIST: Could it be a problem though Sir if Mr ....

PM: Well that's a different question. It's a hypothetical  one which I'm not going -

- 7-

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister you've had a chance now to ....  Senate report on the ATSIC legislation, will the Government  go ahead with that body, do you anticipate the changes that  will be made to the Bill to be major changes or minor

changes and when do you think those decisions will be taken?

PM: I have had a chance to have a preliminary look, but I  still to have discussions in detail with the Minister,  Michelle, and I am not going to make any statement or  foreshadow any positions until I've had that opportunity of

both discussing it with him and with other Ministers. But  let me say this, it would be my presumption and intention  that the legisation should proceed with whatever amendments  we, as a Government, decide are appropriate in the

circumstances. After whatever consultation may in the  circumstances, further consultation, it may be necessary  with the Aboriginal community.

JOURNALIST: Do you think another major round may be  necessary?

PM: I'm not sure at this stage. I simply repeat I haven't  yet had detailed discussions with the Minister and I can't  answer that until I've done that.

JOURNALIST: Are you concerned about the very strong  criticism in the majority report about the lack of adequate  consultation?

PM: Yes, one must be concerned. I must say that on the  basis of my knowledge the consultations were extensive. I  mean the Minister reported to me on a number of occasions,  both on the number and the nature of the consultations and I

certainly form the impression from those discussions and  from the comments of others who are involved in them that  they had been extensive. There does seem to be some  difference of view on this but I find it very difficult, on

the basis of my knowledge, to be critical of the Minister as  to the extent and nature of the consultations on the  knowledge that I have. They were both extensive and, as far  as I could judge, effective.

JOURNALIST: Do you see any need for consultation with the  States on this legislation?

PM: Well there has been forms of consultation. The  Minister discussed a whole range of matters with his  counterparts in the States. As to whether further  consultation is necessary that would be something that I  would need to, .... conclusion which I'd need to come on the

basis of further discussions with him. I can't answer the  question, authoritatively, until I have discussed the matter  with the Minister.

JOURNALIST: Have you told Paul Keating not to dispute  rulings by the Speaker?

- 8-

PM: .No I haven't told Paul Keating how to behave himself in  the Parliament.

JOURNALIST: If there was a situation such as the Cope  situation and one of your Ministers was named,  would you  back the Speaker?

PM: That seems to me, just prima facie,  to be a very, very  hypothetical question Laurie.

JOURNALIST: Not too hypothetical after yesterday is it  Prime Minister?

PM: Well I don't know. Let me just, as yesterday's events  have been raised,  let me just make this point which I think  is appreciated by those of you who have watched the affairs

of this Parliament now over some period of time.  The  fundamental point that has to be understood is that by  deliberate decision, by deliberate decision, the Opposition  has decided to attempt to create a different form of

Parliamentary proceedings. I am not a member of the  Parliament for an extraordinarily long time, others are, but  I have been a close follower,  listener to Parliamentary

proceedings for a very long time,  and to the best of my  knowledge there has never been a situation as that which the  Opposition has attempted to create.  They are totally  incapable of handling Question Time as all preceeding

oppositions have been capable of handling it. That is that  all preceeding oppositions have been able to use Question  Time effectively to probe Ministers by asking questions  about policies based upon the fact that they themselves have

policy positions. Oppositions have said 'well here's our  position, there's the Government position, we're going to  hammer the Government on questions of policy from a basis of  our own policy position'. Now that's been the basis of the  way in which Question Time has operated in this place from

day one.  But now we have,  for the first time, an Opposition  which has demonstrably proved itself incapable of operating  as every other opposition before it has. Why? The simple  reason is, it has no policy positions. None.  Let's look at

the existing critically important area of economic policy.  What's the essence of economic policy? When you get down to  the guts of it, it's a question of what's your fiscal

policy, what are you going to raise from the public either  for personal tax, company tax or other forms of tax and how  are you going to spend it and how are you going to adjust  the relationship between the two? That's the very guts of  Government. Now on that critical area, not only do you have  no policy on the part of the Opposition, but more

importantly than that you have now exposed a fundamental  difference of view within the Opposition. You have the  Shadow Treasurer who seems to be really a Shadow, Shadow,  Shadow Treasurer because you have Hewson,  the Shadow Finance  Minister saying 'well we' with the obvious compliance of his

leader, 'we probably won't really reach our position, final  position on tax or on what we do on the outlay side. We'll

- 9-

(PM cont)  probably leave all that in some sort of a limbo  until after the election'.  But the Shadow Treasurer who  presumably in these matters should have the real running,  saying 'well that's not right, don't talk to Hewson, talk to  me'.  So there you have the public indication of their  unreadiness, their lack of preparation, compare it with what  was being said last year, both by their leader and by their

external Party President Elliott. Unequivocal commitments  last year to have their positions publicly stated by August  of last year, August of 1988. We're now March of 1989, no  further down the track. Indeed, regressed because now

saying 'well"we mightn't have our policies prepared at all  before the election'.  So there is the core of the problem  which differentiates this Opposition from every previous  opposition. Having no policy position themselves, they have

no basis, no basis whatsoever to do what every previous  opposition has done. To question the Government from their  policy position, probe weaknesses. What have they decided  to put in its place? For the first time ever, they have  decided to put in place, not being able to do or perform the

traditional function of an opposition, organised  pandemonium. Ministers can hardly start an answer before  the cacophony of hee-haws and mindless laughter, giggles  based on ignorance start. Points of order, manifestly not  wellfounded. Now obviously that position places strains on

the rest of the organisation and not least upon Madam  Speaker. I accept that our behaviour in six years of  Government hasn't been perfect and you know I'm always  prepared to say that we're not perfect, we make mistakes.  We have made mistakes including myself, but what I want to

say is that those mistakes are made within an historically  unique situation and may I say, I want to say in regard to  the Speaker that I feel very sorry for her that she is, in a  sense, the victim of the basic inadequacy, incompetence and

historically unrivalled incompetence and unprincipled nature  of this Opposition.

JOURNALIST: I'm not trying to do a Tuckey and harp on  relevance but you haven't really answered the question.  Will you give a guarantee that you will back the Speaker  even if she felt it necessary to discipline one of your

ministers?

PM: I believe that that would be the appropriate course of  action.

JOURNALIST: That's a guarantee?

PM: I don't in advance Laurie answer hypothetical questions  and I don't really think that you would expect me to. I  would need to know every circumstance that was involved at  the time but certainly what you put is what I would expect

to happen.

- 10-

JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke,  did your Government receive  representations from either Mr Kelty or Justice Maddern  about Justice Staples and if judges of the Industrial  Relations Commission aren't really judges as you said last  week are you still going to continue to pay them the same

salary and allowance as Federal Court judges?

PM: I didn't receive any submissions from Kelty or the  Commission about Staples. I don't know whether any of my  Ministers did, I certainly personally didn't receive any.  Let's make it quite clear, don't let's have the discussion

muddied in any way Milton by the use of the word 'judge'  implying that he held a judicial position. He didn't, and  he doesn't, never held a judicial position, not a judicial  body. So don't let's muddy the waters by reference to

judicial positions. Secondly let's make it clear, the fact  that Staples was, as it were, unemployed was not a decision  of this Government or of the previous government. It was as  a result of successive decisions by successive presidents of  the tribunal. It was their decision and as you know and as

I said in my answer in the Parliament, the previous  government had not only acknowledged but facilitated these  positions, first of all by sending him off on some overseas

trip and then secondly by an amendment of the legislation to  facilitate the action of the president of the commission in  making the decisions affecting Staples. So those are the  facts. Not judicial and not action of the Government -

decisions of the Commission. In those circumstances we took  the legislative action that's been involved and out of which  comes this controversy. Now in those circumstances the  results are automatic.

JOURNALIST: The others aren't judges either - that follows  from what you said. Will you continue to pay them the same  rate of pay as Federal Court judges?

PM: The question of the remuneration of High Court judges,  Federal Court judges and members of these other tribunals is  something that will be decided by the Cabinet in the  relatively near future.

JOURNALIST: You've emphasised Mr Hawke that your tax  package is particularly directed at families. Is it  possible that you could look at, in this context, family  allowances as well as the tax structure itself?

PM: Yes, it's conceivable it will have to be looked at  Michelle but I'm obviously not going to say in advance what  it is we're going to do. But the answer to your question is  yes it's conceivable that that can be looked at as well.

JOURNALIST: Have you had a chance to look at yet and do you  have an opinion on the Industrial Relations blueprint  released last Friday by the Greiner government?

- 11-

PM: No, it probably doesn't come as any surprise to you  Paul that in the massive material that I have to read that  decisions of the Greiner government don't come very high on  the list and it hasn't quite got onto the agenda yet.

JOURNALIST: Do you accept that the self government system  that your Government has put in place in Canberra has now  become a joke?

PM: The which?

JOURNALIST: The self government system here. Do you accept  it's now a joke.  Is there anything that can be done about  it?

PM: I don't accept that it's a joke. I must say it's  becoming rather difficult to foretell the outcome of the  electoral processes.

JOURNALIST: Will you do anything about it? ...

PM: No, I don't think that point's been reached. Let's  wait until you get the outcome of the vote and the  discussions between the parties and non-parties.  ... going  to happen.

JOURNALIST: On another parliamentary question Prime  Minister,  how soon can the television audiences of Australia  expect to see what you say in Parliament as well as hear?

PM: I don't know the answer to that question. I haven't got anything before me at the moment,  any proposals before  me on this issue. Just expressing a personal view and  that's all I'm doing, not a Government view -

JOURNALIST: Would you like us to give you a proposal?

PM: I'm not quite sure what Cabinet ... Laurie but I'd be  more than happy to receive one - but I'm expressing a  personal view. I think it would make sense for it to be  televised but not imposed. If people want to watch us in

action, and I think there are probably a lot of people who  would like to, then that's a decision which stations ought  to be free to take.  This is purely a personal view but I  don't think it's something that ought to be imposed on an

unwilling public.

JOURNALIST: What do you think of yesterday's Senate  Education report that most Australians don't know how this  place works, and does it matter so long as they're kept in  touch with the issues?

- 12-

PM: That doesn't distinguish them from some people who are  here all the time. I mean when I read some of the things  that some of you reporters say about what has happened,   which hasn't happened, what hope is there? The answer to  your question is it's disappointing but I have no doubt that

you've seen material in regard to the United States, the  lack of knowledge in the United States about their  governmental processes,  the institutions,  even names of  presidents and senior positions like this. It just does

seem to be a feature of political life in most countries  that the people don't attach the same importance to us as we  attach to ourselves.

JOURNALIST: Just getting back to the Speaker Mr Hawke,  when  you said the Government has made some mistakes in the  Parliament over the last six years,  has Mrs Child also made  some mistakes and have you and other members of the

Government ever had any doubts about her ability to handle  the position?

PM: Mrs Child would admit she's made some mistakes. I  suppose she would be upset that on a particular occasion she  hasn't readily identified a member and his constituency, his  or her constituency. I don't think that that's something to  get terribly excited about but she may regard it as a  mistake. No, in regard to Mrs Child I've regarded her as a

good Speaker.

JOURNALIST: Do you think there's a case to follow the  British system where the Speaker is removed from a political  role and doesn't need to belong to the party or go to Caucus  meetings or whatever to politically neutralise the role?

PM: It sounds good, easier to do in a House of Commons of  the best part of 600 members.  Not so easy to do in  Australia I would think.  Conceptually it sounds attractive  but I doubt given the relatively much smaller size of our

House of Representatives that parties would be able to come  to an accommodation on it.

JOURNALIST: Was it premature to disallow Japanese  involvement in the Woolloomooloo Bay redevelopment project?

PM: There wasn't a disallowance of Japanese investment as  such. It was a disallowance made on environmental grounds.  I'm glad you asked that question because it gives me the  opportunity of affirming once again my own and the  Government's very strong position. We will not be party to

any discrimination in investment on grounds of race or of  nation and it wasn't the case in the particular project to  which you refer.  It was a decision on environmental  grounds.
