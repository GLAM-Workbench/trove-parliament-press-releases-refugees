The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Bill *  Hayden, M.P.,

today announced that Australia was contributing $1.045

million to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees

(UNHCR) following an appeal for assistance for Ethiopian

refugees in Somalia.

Mr Hayden said that since December 1985 about 71,000

Ethiopians had entered north-west Somalia and were being  accommodated at a transit centre near the border. There  were severe and immediate food shortages as well as an

urgent need for better facilities, for example drinking

water has to be trucked in from about 50 km away.

UNHCR hopes soon to obtain permission from the Somali

Government to relocate the refugees in more suitable sites.

Funds for trucks to enable such movement have been included

in the latest UNHCR appeal.

Mr Hayden said that Australia's assistance consisted of

an $800,000 accountable cash grant for the purchase of

food and an accountable cash grant of $245,000 for other

relief needs, such as medical supplies and trucks.

Mr Hayden said that this financial year the Australian

Government would contribute a total of $31.495 million

in food and emergency humanitarian assistance to Africa.

The grant forms part of the Australian Government's

humanitarian response to disaster situations throughout

the world, and is provided from aid funds administ red by

the Australian Development Assistance Bureau.
