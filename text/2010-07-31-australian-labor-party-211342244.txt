E & O E - PROOF ONLY

Subjects:      Polls; Australian Labor Party

CURTIS:        And welcome. It also is the Competition Policy Minister Craig Emerson  who I spoke to a little earlier today.

EMERSON:   Well, I think Kevin can handle all that. I think we would be very happy  to utilise Kevin's talents and his standing in Queensland, and he's made that offer.

If and when he's well enough to take up the mantle of going around  Queensland working with the Labor candidates and members, we’d very much  welcome that. It'll be a good development.

But priority goes to recovering from the operation and we do wish Kevin  all the very best.

CURTIS:        The latest Nielson Poll in the Fairfax papers shows the Coalition in an  election winning position and your primary vote at 36. You need it to be in the 40s to  win don't you?

EMERSON:   Well, I'm not going to comment on the details of polls. It's a long way to  Election Day - three weeks today.

CURTIS:        But do you accept that you haven't had the best campaign so far, and  there are signs that the Labor Party may be in some trouble, particularly in  Queensland?

EMERSON:   Well, I was going to comment that this election is on a knife edge.  There's no doubt about that.

And if Australia wakes up to a Tony Abbott Prime Ministership on the  22nd of August they will wake up to cuts in Trades Training Centres. There will be no  more computers in schools. There will be no more GP super clinics.

Tony Abbott as Prime Minister would pull the plug on the National  Broadband Network.

CURTIS:        But how do you intend to turn your campaign around? It's been beset  by leaks, by question marks over your polices on asylum seekers and emissions  trading. Do you need to do something different?

EMERSON:   Look, campaigns are about choices. And there's a choice between a

Gillard led Labor Government and an Abbott led Coalition Government.

Tony Abbott this week confirmed that he will apply a great big new tax  on everything you buy. He's also confirmed through the cuts that he would swing a  great big new axe on everything you use.

CURTIS:        If he would be so bad, what does it say to you that it seems from the  Nielsen poll that voters are willing to take that option?

EMERSON:   Well, let's go to polling day. We're three weeks out. This election will be  on a knife edge. The campaign is about a choice between Tony Abbott as Prime  Minister and his polices and Julia Gillard as Prime Minister and her policies.

And in the end elections are about policies, about who's best to manage  the economy and who's best to provide services.

CURTIS:        You faced another damaging leak this morning that Julia Gillard didn't  turn up to all the meetings of the National Security Committee.

Is this a tit for tat leak responding to the story that Kevin Rudd didn't  turn up to all the meetings of the National Security Committee, and is it again  damaging your cause?

EMERSON:   Well, Cabinet confidentiality requirements mean that we can't talk  about the contents of Cabinet meetings or Cabinet Committee meetings or those who  attended Cabinet meetings or Cabinet Committee meetings.

CURTIS:        Are the stories damaging for Labor?

EMERSON:   Well, you have to play with… play what's in front of you and sometimes  these things happen. Newspaper reports occur. They will occur for us, they will occur  for the Coalition and it's a matter of how you handle them.

And I know just that Julia Gillard earlier in the week drew a lot of  support and accolades for the way that she handled some rather challenging issues.  She was very Prime Ministerial. She showed her resolve. She showed her toughness.  She showed her determination to govern this country in the national interest.
