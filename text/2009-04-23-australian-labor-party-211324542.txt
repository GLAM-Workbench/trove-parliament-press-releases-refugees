TODAY SHOW, CHANNEL NINE

SUBJECTS: IMF Report; Budget; Interest Rates; Asylum Seekers

STEFANOVIC:

The Treasurer joins us from Canberra this morning. Good morning to you, Treasurer.

TREASURER:

Good to be with you, Karl.

STEFANOVIC:

What do you make of those figures from the IMF, particularly unemployment numbers  topping out at around 7.8 per cent?

TREASURER:

Well, there's certainly a bleak outlook for the global economy and it certainly means that we  are producing a Budget in the toughest circumstances since the Great Depression. So, it will  certainly have an impact on growth in this country, and you can see that in the forecasts -  a negative forecast for '09 for Australia in the IMF forecasts. But the other point we have to  keep in mind here, Karl, is that we are doing better than just about any other advanced  country, as you said in your introduction. Growth in advanced economies across the globe  will contract by -3.8 per cent. So, Australia's better placed than most, but very, very big  challenges for the Budget and certainly very, very big challenges for government revenues.

STEFANOVIC:

Alright. In particular reference, though, to that unemployment figure - 7.8 per cent - a little  further advanced to what you had been predicting in Treasury. Are you prepared to concede  that it may go beyond 7.8 per cent at this point?

TREASURER:

Well, certainly the figures and forecasts will be in the Budget. I certainly can't speculate  about those. But when growth slows so dramatically internationally it does have an impact  here and it certainly means unemployment will be higher here than we had previously  forecast. That's why the Budget is just so important. We have to continue to stimulate our  domestic economy in the face of this global recession, and also make the critical  investments for the future so that when global growth returns we maximise the

opportunities from that global growth, and in particular the employment opportunities that  will flow from domestic stimulus, investment in the future, and also leveraging off a faster  growing international economy when growth recovers there.

STEFANOVIC:

Okay. So, if we are to assume that unemployment is going to move beyond 7.8 per cent,  even beyond that, and having been through two stimulus packages already, and it looks like  there's going to be a third stimulus package, it could be argued quite conceivably that the  stimulus packages have not had much of an impact on jobs, haven't had any effect at all.

TREASURER:

I completely reject that, Karl. This report shows pretty conclusively that fiscal stimulus of  the type that we've put in place from our stimulus packages back in October last year and  again in February this year have made the Australian economy much, much better placed  than any other economy.

STEFANOVIC:

How many jobs have been created?

TREASURER:

Well, certainly it's been supporting employment in the retail sector very strongly and that's  where over one million people work. We can see the impacts in the housing sector, and or  course, Karl, something like two-thirds of our Nation Building and Jobs package is now  beginning to flow through in terms of investment in schools, in energy efficiency and in  housing. That stimulus package is flowing through the economy right now precisely at the  time that it is needed because of this dramatic collapse that's occurred in global growth in  the March quarter this year, and that has come on top of a dramatic collapse in global  growth in the December quarter last year.

STEFANOVIC:

Just on that, it's a good point. The UK has posted a Budget deficit, as you would've seen in  the last 12 or so hours, of $175 billion for the coming financial year. How big will our deficit  be, and do Australians need to prepare themselves for having a large deficit and for a long  period of time?

TREASURER:

Well, certainly we will have a larger temporary deficit in this country as a result of this  global recession.

STEFANOVIC:

How big?

TREASURER:

Well, those figures will there, Karl, on Budget night. All those forecasts will be presented for  everybody to see. But compared to the forecasts for deficits and debt in other advanced  economies, our figures will be much more modest because our underlying fiscal position is  much, much stronger than many other developed countries in the world.

STEFANOVIC:

Mr Swan, a question on mortgages. Do you have a mortgage, incidentally?

TREASURER:

No, I don't but I did have one for 20-odd years but I don't now.

STEFANOVIC:

You are fortunate, though, in this position.

TREASURER:

I am very fortunate.

STEFANOVIC:

Would you go, at this point, for those people who have an average income, an average  mortgage out there, would your recommendation to stay on a variable rate or go to a fixed  rate at this point?

TREASURER:

Karl, I cannot give financial advice. There are financial advisers out there thatâ€¦

STEFANOVIC:

Yeah, but you're a smart bloke and you know the economy. You know the economy better  than most and you know what the forward transition is going to be, what the outlook is  going to be. What would your advice be for people?

TREASURER:

My advice would be to shop around. That's what my advice would be for people to go out  there and compare the rates from the various banks. I mean, you did a great job on the  program a few days ago highlighting what one particular bank had done with deposit rates  on savings accounts. I think people need to shop around in this environment and get the  best deal and seek out the best advice.

STEFANOVIC:

The problem is exit fees of course.

TREASURER:

There are a series of problems out there and there is no doubt we need to keep a pretty  strong eye on competition in the banking sector. The Government has been doing that and  putting forward a number of initiatives to reinforce competition in the banking sector. I  reckon people ought to shop around, particularly when they're looking at those rates.

STEFANOVIC:

One final question for you, Treasurer, and this is to do with not your portfolio but in general,  asylum seekers. The latest boat with asylum seekers on it got within 60 kilometres of the

shoreline. That's pretty tight, isn't it?

TREASURER:

Well, certainly we know there's been an upsurge in activity around the globe and in this  area because of circumstances in countries such as Pakistan and other countries in the  region. It just means we have to be out there with all of our forces as quickly as we can  detecting them.

STEFANOVIC:

Alright, Treasurer. Thank you very much for your time today. We appreciate it. Good luck in  the coming months.
