OPPOSITION ASTRAY ON [MOZAMBIQUE

Criticism by the Leader of the Opposition, Mr John Howard,  of   the $6 million emergency aid package for Mozambique 'reveals   little understanding of what is happening in that country',

Russell Rollason. the executive director of the Australian   Council for Overseas Aid,  said today. And he also criticised   some media editorial opinion on the issue.

The package was announced by^Mr Bill Hayden J Minister for  Foreign Affairs and Trade,  when he was in Maputo last month.   Mozambique will also be receiving some aid from the $100 million   three year aid program for the front-line states of Southern   Africa. *

Mr Rollason made his comment when announcing ACFOA1s   Parliamentary Brief on the situation in Mozambique, which went   to the Prime Minister, Mr Bob Hawke,  Mr Hayden, and all other   MPs today. He commended the Government's judgment of   Mozambique's acute suffering and needs.

Mr Chester Crocker,  the US Assistant Secretary for African   Affairs 'could hardly be accused of being a Marxist sympathiser   or easily hoodwinked in Africa', said Mr Rollason. He drew   attention to Mr Crocker's testimony to the US Senate Foreign   Relations Committee in June last year:

Mozambique had made its break with socialism because it had   become disillusioned with statist economic policies and with no   guarantee in advance of significant Western help. It was a myth   to argue that Mozambique was seeking Western help to bail out a   failed experiment in socialism, according to Mr Crocker.

Mr Rollason said about half of Mozambique's population of 14   million are in dire need.  The country's infant mortality rate   (375 per 1,000) is the highest in the world. Drought and the   ravages of South African-backed rebels have caused severe hunger   and suffering among hundreds of thousands of homeless men, women   and children.

AUSTRALIAN COUNCIL FOR OVERSEAS AID

PARLIAMENTARY BRIEF 1/88 March 1988

MOZAMBIQUE

Close to seven million people in Mozambique are in  dire need. That’s about half of the country’s populaÂ­ tion. Drought compounded by the war being waged  by South A frican-backed rebels have caused

widespread food shortages and forced thousands to flee  their homes in terror. The infant mortality rate in  Mozambique (375 per 1000) is the world’s highest.

Many of these desperate refugees have no clothes, inÂ­  stead they wear bits of sack or bark. Food production  is in chaos. They need food, trucks, seeds and tools  or thousands may starve. They also need greater interÂ­

national understanding.

During his visit to Mozambique, the Minister for  Foreign Affairs and Trade announced a A$6 million  emergency assistance package for Mozambique.  Mozambique will also receive assistance under the new

three year A$100m aid program for Southern Africa.

Misplaced criticisms Criticisms of Australias’s aid package to Mozambique  and of the Mozambican Government by the OpposiÂ­  tion and the media reveals lit tie understanding of what

is happening in Mozambique. In June last year, Mr  Chester Crocker,US Assistant Secretary for African  Affairs appeared before the Subcommittee for Africa  of the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee and  much of the following information is drawn from his  testimony. Mr Crocker could hardly be accused of  being a Marxist sympathizer or easily hoodwinked in  Af rica.

Moza mbique' s turn t o  t h e  W e s t Mozambique achieved independence from Portugal in  1975 under a government comprised of the national

liberation movement Frelimo (Revolutionary Front for  the Liberation of Mozambique).

At independence Mozambique lacked even the rudiÂ­  ments of a modern economy. The new government  inherited a large external debt and a currency that was  virtually worthless abroad. With independence, most  of the 250,000 Portuguese inhabitants fled, taking with  them Mozambique’s limited fund of administrative and  technical expertise. Mozambique’s workforce was unÂ­

trained and uneducated; the illiteracy rate at  independence was 96%. Given this dismal legacy, it is  not surprising that by the late 1970’s, factories were  running far below pre-independence efficiency and  agricultural production had dropped sharply in many  areas.

By 1983, faced with economic collapse, a suffocating  and unproductive link to Moscow, and a growing inÂ­ surgency, Mozambican leaders made a fundamental  decision to reorient their country’s foreign and domesÂ­

tic policies. Under the leadership of the late President  Samora Machel, the Government of Mozambique began  to change drastically its economic policies, reduce its  dependence on Moscow, reassert its independence and

nonalignment, and reach out to the West. In 1985,  President Reagan received the late President Samora  Machel in the White House. Ã¢ÂÂ

Despite President Mach el’s death in an October 1986  plane crash, the positive momentum of US-MozamÂ­ bican relations has continued - and even accelerated -  under his successor, President Joaquim Chissano.

Economic m a n a g e m e n t As Mr Crocker told the US Senate Committee, another  myth about Mozambique holds that the Government is  seeking Western economic assistance to bail outa failed  experiment in socialism. In reality, Mozambique made

its break withsocialism because of disillusionment with  statist economic policies and with no guarantees in adÂ­  vance that significant Western help would be  forthcoming.

At a time when many other governments are retreatÂ­  ing from economic reform programs, Mozambique has  reached agreement with the IMF (International  Monetary Fund) and World Bank on a tough and senÂ­ sible economic recovery plan that is the most  far-reaching such program undertaken by any African

country. Since 1984, at least 30 firms in the light inÂ­  dustry sector have been privatized. In the same way,  the Government has returned large tracts of land from  state farms to private farmers.

In an impressive vote of confidence in Morambique’s  new economic course, the Paris Club has just granted  Mozambique some of the most favorable terms it has  ever offered for the rescheduling of external debt

Growing W e s t e r n  s u p p o r t Western economic assistance to Mozambique dwarfs  that of the Soviet bloc. In 1986, the British began  training Mozambican army personnel and conducted a

very successful naval ship visit to Mozambique. Other  NATO governments have also developed productive  security relationships with Mozambique.

President Chissano’s first trip to Europe was to LonÂ­  don and Rome, not Moscow. Chissano met with Prime  Minister Thatcher on May 6 1987, for talks described  by the British as’exceptionally warm’. During the visit,

the British Government announced that it would  provide US$25m in additional economic assistance to  Mozambique.

S o u t h  African backed terrorism Chester Crocker provided the US Senate Committee  with a short history of Rename or the Mozambican  National Resistance (MNR).

Renamo was created by the Rhodesian secret service  in 1977 to punish Mozambique for that country’s asÂ­  sistance to Zimbabwean liberation movements. With  Zimbabwe’s independence in 1980, sponsorship of

Renamo was taken over by the South African Defence  Force. South Africa’s direct support for Renamo  diminished after the Nkomati accord and as Renamo  capture of weapons and equipment inside MozambiÂ­ que reduced its requirements for South African  hardware. However, there is credible evidence that  South Africa remains a reliable supplier of high-  priority items that Renamo is not able to acquire on its  own.

The highly respected Australian doctor, Julie Cliff,  who has lived and worked in Mozambique for the past

12 years recently co-authored a report on the impact  of MNR sabotage on the health care system in MozamÂ­ bique. Her report pointed out that the MNR has  destroyed over 30 percent of the country’s health  centres. As a result, more than 2 million Mozambicans  have been cut off from the country’s health service.

UNICEF estimates that there were 84,000 child deaths  in Mozambique in 1986 alone due to ’war and  destruction’.
