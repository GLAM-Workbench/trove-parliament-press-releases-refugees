Symposium: A Decade of Howard Government

After Howard’s decade, is Australia  more conservative?   Gabrielle Meagher, The University of Sydney  Shaun Wilson, Macquarie University

As he conceded to John Howard’s victorious Coalition, the last Labor prime minister,  Paul Keating, said: ‘if you change government, you change the country.’ In the four  preceding years, the political life of the country had been enlivened by Keating’s bold  hope of an Australia transformed—of an economy locked into Asia, and of a  multicultural society that had transcended its English heritage and was genuinely  aware of Aboriginal injustice.

Has Keating’s weary prediction proved right? There’s little doubt that a conservative  wind has blown across John Howard’s Australia. The country has lost its focus on  Asian rapprochement, gone through a traumatic ‘race debate’ that saw up to a quarter  of Queenslanders vote for One Nation in 1998, rejected a republic at referendum, and  watched by as refugees became political targets in the 2001 election campaign. At all  times, Howard has been at the centre of these reversals, and his conservative agenda  has now well and truly repudiated the Keating legacy. Howard’s Government has  gone on to ban same-sex marriage, to pursue the building and maritime unions, to  reinvigorate the role of churches in social policy, and to tailor welfare to breadwinner  families.

Should any of this come as a surprise? After all, Howard is  a proud conservative, and has never hidden his ambitions  for Australia. Have his changes been endorsed by the  Australian public? The short answer surely lies in the Government’s repeated  victories at the polls. But a longer answer—and one we pursue here—seeks to  discover how much of Howard’s success is a public endorsement of his brand of  conservatism.

IS AUSTRALIA BECOMING MORE  CONSERVATIVE?   Howard’s agenda reads like the list of conservative ‘hot-button’ issues that have  helped rebuild Republican fortunes in the United States: family values, small  government, Christian morals, and the virtues of free enterprise and self-reliance. We  can add to this list Howard’s own convictions for Australia: monarchism, pro-Americanism, and a blokesy version of Australian nationalism.

Have these convictions translated into public policies, and has the public supported  them with an equal conviction? Let’s look closely at three policy areas—family  policies, economic reform, and immigration—where there’s decent public opinion  data to check whether policy change under the Coalition is reflected in Australian





social attitudes. (Readers will find a guide to our primary sources at the end of the  article.)

There’s no doubt that Howard’s ‘family values’—which emphasise the traditional  roles of male breadwinner and female homemaker—find ever clearer expression in  social policy. In one area of expanding welfare, the Family Tax Benefit system, ‘stay-at-home mums’ now receive payments without means testing in an otherwise highly  targeted social security system. Meanwhile, working mothers in low and middle  income households face strong economic disincentives to participating in work (Apps  2004; Hill 2006). Policy analysts are now speculating that pro-breadwinner welfare is  feeding into real-world changes in women’s workforce participation (Kelly et al.  2005).

Yet public opinion is moving against the conservative values that underlie this policy  direction. A large proportion of Australians now understand ‘family’ as a much more  inclusive institution than the ‘man and stay-at-home mum’ combination that  conservatives extol; as Ann Evans and Edith Gray show, more than half of all

Australians under 50 now believe that a same-sex couple with children is a family  (2005, p. 19). In fact, support for traditional gender roles has fallen precipitously in  recent decades. In 1980, nearly two thirds of Australians agreed that ‘It is much better

for everyone involved if the man is the breadwinner and the woman takes care of the  home and family’ (Age Poll 1980). By 2002, less than a quarter agreed (ISSP 2002).  And opposition to mothers working—even those with preschool children—is now a  minority view. In 1994, half of all Australians agreed that ‘preschool children suffer if

the mother works’ (ISSP 1994). By 2003, this had fallen to around a third (AuSSA  2003). Although these questions don’t ask about policy preferences, these findings  suggest that there is no longer majority support among Australians for values that  prioritise traditional families.

There is no doubt that the Government has staked its reputation on its day-to-day  economic management and a majority of Australians agree that the Government is  best to handle the economy (Newspoll 2006). And on the major economic issue of the  2004 election campaign—the future direction of interest rates—the public strongly  sided with the Government over Labor (AES 2004), who seemed hopelessly tagged  with the high interest rates of the late 1980s.

However, when we turn to matters of economic reform, a gap between policy and  public opinion emerges. Industrial relations deregulation, privatisation, and smaller  government have become mainstays of the Howard reform agenda. We might debate  whether these are genuinely ‘conservative’ or ‘neoliberal’ policies and whether they  are uniquely Coalition initiatives or continuing directions established under previous  Labor governments. Either way, most Australians don’t  support them.

Opposition to recent industrial relations changes is strong at  around 60 per cent (AC Nielsen Polls, cited in Wilson 2005,  p. 290). Privatisation attracts as little support. A majority of Australians prefer public  ownership for Telstra (57 per cent), electricity (60 per cent), public transport (63 per  cent), Australia Post (67 per cent), and for prisons (67 per cent) (see Pusey &  Turnbull 2005, pp. 165-66). And even though tax cuts have been consistently  promoted by the Government, their popularity has fallen against other priorities for





government. Support for income tax cuts over increased spending on social services  has fallen steadily from 65 per cent in 1987 to 36 per cent in 2004 (AES 1987-2004).  In sum, the public endorses the Government’s economic management, but wherever  conservative ideology appears to be shaping economic policy, public support falls  away.

Assessing immigration policy and attitudes is particularly complex. Prime Minister  Howard has fostered an inward-looking nationalism, which we might expect to be  reflected in a smaller immigration program and strong anti-immigration sentiment.  Certainly, several Howard ministers and the Prime Minister himself manipulated  perceptions of the ‘children overboard’ and Tampa incidents, thereby blurring  distinctions between refugees, terrorists and Muslims to their electoral advantage  (Marr & Wilkinson 2003; Weller 2002).

Yet the Howard Government has not been consistently ‘anti-immigration’ (see Gittins  2003). On the contrary, immigration has increased under Howard: total settler arrivals  in 2003-04 were 60 per cent higher than they were a decade before (Commonwealth  of Australia 2004, p. 9). What has changed is the balance between different kinds of  immigrants. The program now emphasises business’s interest in attracting more  skilled labour, as opposed to unpopular family reunion component of the program  (see, for example, Business Council of Australia 1999).

How has the public responded to immigration under Howard? Focusing on one  headline measure, public support for immigration is higher than it has been for a  generation (AES 1990-2004; Goot & Watson 2005, pp. 183-185). But does this  represent agreement with Howard’s policy changes or a rejection of conservative anti-immigration politics? The answer is likely to be a mix of factors in criss-crossing  directions. The stronger economy has undermined one traditional source of hostility to  migration: a lack of jobs for Australian-born workers. Howard’s high profile in the  immigration and refugee debates may have instilled greater confidence among  conservative Australians in the immigration mix. But other Australians probably now  feel uncomfortable with anti-immigration politics, coming to see that immigrants are  good for the Australian economy and society. There is, moreover, little evidence to  support the proposition that Australians are willingly turning their back on  multiculturalism (Goot & Watson 2005, p. 184), even though the Prime Minister  himself has explicitly criticised it.

What the immigration policy illustrates is the complex relation between public policy  and public opinion. Political scientists in the United States are vigorously debating  whether public opinion ultimately determines the direction of policy or whether  politicians selectively ‘pander’ to the public in pursuit of their political goals—even  when those goals are not widely supported (Erikson et al 2002; Hacker & Pierson  2005, Jacobs & Shapiro 2002). What we cannot say, however, is that the Howard  Government has ‘made’ Australian public opinion more  conservative.

Certainly, it is reasonable to say that the Government has  pandered to some prejudices in the community, crafting its  policy responses and increase its popularity. But in a raft of areas, from the role of  women in the economy to the place of public services, and even in the immigration  debate, we find no evidence of a uniform trend to a more conservative Australia.





Indeed, the countervailing pressure of public opinion may have occasionally forced  the Government to accommodate opposition to a privatisation of healthcare (the  public strongly endorses Medicare) and to major cutbacks in the social safety net.  Like all governments, the Howard Government remains subject to both the cycles of  public opinion that punish governments for moving too far in one direction, and to  secular trends in social attitudes that have generally produced a more open and  tolerant society.

IF NOT, WHY IS THE GOVERNMENT  POPULAR?  We have shown that Australians have not moved ‘off center’ to borrow Hacker and  Pierson’s (2005) useful phrase. If anything, the public has drifted leftwards in their  attitudes in major policy areas, supporting working women, public spending, and  immigration. So we can’t confirm that the Government remains popular because it has  succeeded in finding the true centre of gravity in Australian politics. If Howard’s  ultimate goal is to instil more conservative values, then he is unlikely to succeed.

So why is the Howard Government still popular after a decade in office? Before  offering some alternative answers, perhaps it’s sensible to qualify the extent of the  Government’s popularity. The previous Labor government won five elections,  something the current government is yet to do, and governed for thirteen years. The  record for the conservative side of politics—23 years— is unlikely to be matched.  Although it seems possible that a Howard-led government will narrowly win in 2007,  which would mean the Government holds office for at least fourteen years, a change  of leadership this year would make the 2007 contest more difficult to call.

Although we argue against the belief that the Howard Government is unusually  popular, we do not dispute that the government is well positioned as it enters its  second decade in office. We contend that its strong position does not depend so much  in a shift to the right in Australian values, but on three other factors: the prosperous  economy, the solid state of the Coalition electorate, and Labor’s present travails.  We’ll try to show that the latter two factors are closely related.

After a decade and a half of economic growth, Australia is a wealthier country, and  the benefits have been spread widely enough to shift Australian’s fundamental views  of the economy. While some voters are swayed by non-economic factors, many are  influenced by the performance of the economy. Goot and Watson report that pride in  Australia’s economic achievements has risen from 48 per cent in 1995 (Labor’s last

full year in office) to 80 per cent in 2003 (2005, p. 190).

Results from the Australian Election Studies reveal much the same thing. The number  of Australians saying that their household’s financial situation had improved over the  previous year has increased continuously during Howard’s tenure, from 19 per cent in  1996 to 28 per cent in 2004. The largest jump (7 per cent) took place between the last  two elections of 2001 and 2004. Even stronger have been general perceptions of the  economy; when asked if the economic situation in Australia was better or worse than  the previous year, voters are increasingly positive. In 1990, as few as 8 per cent  thought better; by 2004, this number had risen to 42 per cent.

Has the public attributed the economy’s turnaround to the  Howard Government? The short answer appears to be yes— and this holds for personal finances as well as the economy  overall. In 2004, around one in five voters were prepared to  say that the Government had a good effect on their personal finances. While this  doesn’t seem high, but it represents a strengthening trend since 1993, when only one  in twenty voters thought so. When it comes to the overall economy, voters are equally  sanguine about the Government’s impact; in 2004, 35 per cent of Australians thought  the Government had a good effect on the economy, compared with just 13 per cent  under Keating in 1996. Labor’s complaint about the Government cruising along on  the benefits of their reforms in the 1980s appears lost on voters. True, it’s been an  economy run on debt and consumption—but enough people have benefited to keep  any big problems at bay, probably left for the next Labor government to deal with.

Recent commentary on Howard describes him as a man with ‘a genius for politics’  (Wade & Garnaut 2006). Columnist Gerard Henderson calls him Australia’s ‘most  significant Liberal leader’ (2006) and ‘the most successful politician since Robert  Menzies’ (2005). Assessing all the claims about the contribution of Howard’s  leadership skills to the Government’s electoral success lie beyond our brief. We limit  our assessment to the results of voter responses to two questions in the AES 2004.  The first question asks: ‘Would you say that any of the individual party leaders in the  last election represents your views reasonably well?’. Some 41 per cent chose John  Howard, compared with just 25 per cent for the inexperienced Mark Latham. Another  21 per cent chose ‘No leader’.

These results mean that a majority of those expressing a definite opinion identified  with Howard, a clear sign of his connection to voters. But when asked how well  individual political parties represent their views, some 44 per cent of voters chose the  Coalition and 27 per cent chose Labor. No doubt, it’s a big lead for the Coalition, but  if Howard’s leadership abilities are critical to the Government’s electoral fortunes, it’s  surprising that his personal standing among voters is lower than that of the Coalition.

Howard’s gloss of success can be attributed partly to the strength of the Coalition’s  electoral base (which he certainly has contributed to) and to Labor’s weakness. When  we look at party identification (a ready measure of voter loyalties) among Australians  between 1987 and 2004, we get a glimpse at the structural shifts in voter alignment  favouring the Coalition. While the National Party has lost the loyalty of 4 per cent of  voters, dropping from 7 to 3 per cent, the Liberals have actually gained new  supporters over this time (up from 34 to 42 per cent).

But the real story lies on the other side of politics. Labor has suffered a huge decline  since 1987, from 49 per cent to just 32 per cent in 2004. The beneficiaries of this  fragmentation appear to be the Liberals and the Greens, who now attract 5 per cent of  voters. But the largest increase is registered among voters without political  attachment, who now count for 16 per cent of the electorate. Among these voters  without a party loyalty, many must count as disillusioned Labor voters or potential  Labor voters who have never developed an attachment to  the party.

Although we compare unweighted data over several time  periods, the trends in voter loyalty are unmistakable: the









ALP has lost part of its base electorate. And although the focus has been on Labor’s  leadership problems—four different leaders in ten years—the Coalition suffered  similar leadership instability during the 1980s without the additional problem faced  by Labor: erosion of their core constituency.

One source of Labor’s decline is the falling level of union membership. Union  members are loyal Labor voters, so the 50 per cent decline in union membership over  the last twenty years has surely injured the ALP. The economic reforms of the 1980s  and 1990s championed by Labor contributed to a weaker labour movement (Peetz  1997, chapter 4). Viewed in this light, the Party’s commitment to fast-paced reform  seems like an act of political martyrdom.

Chart 1 compares the number of Australians identifying as Labor voters with the  number of union members (AES 1987-2004). We can see that the decline in union  membership closely tracks the decline in ALP identifiers. Here’s the point: a weak  labour movement means a weaker Labor party, and thus a Coalition and Prime  Minister who appear stronger than they might otherwise be.

There may be some better news on the way for Labor, even if they are yet to realise it.  The decline in union membership, measured in both the AES and more systematically  by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (2005), has stopped. Although Labor reformers  seek to further distance the party from organised labour, they might be overlooking  the value of strengthening links to their longstanding ally. Coming off historic lows,  public opinion towards unions is more favourable than it has been for a generation.  And in its recent campaign against industrial relations reforms, the union movement  again proved that it is the strongest social force in Australia politics.

MAKING SENSE OF THE PRESENT   Something of the essence of Howard’s claim to history for his conservative agenda is  captured in statement he made in 2004:

I can’t think of any policy of Federal Labor that would do more damage to the  Australian economy that a restoration of trade union control over industrial relations.  There has been an historic shift in this country over the last decade, and there can be

no turning back, our economy has changed forever as a result of industrial relations  deregulation. Our economy has forever, if that deregulation continues, become a more  productive economy. In 1986, 35 per cent of the Australian workforce employed in  the private sector were members of the trade unions. That figure is now 17.5 per cent.

Howard’s conservative agenda has assumed many guises—monarchism, family  values, the threat of Islam, Australian nationalism, and individual choice—but his  2004 statement reveals its ‘historic’ commitment: to ‘freeing’ the economy from  union control. Antipathy to unions runs so deeply that the Government was prepared  to eliminate student unions to prove it.

The Government could hardly hide its pride last year when  it passed legislation dismantling the industrial relation  system. Its victory was full of symbolism, aggressive  potential and, perhaps, a distasteful overconfidence. Its aim is not to just to keep  productivity high, but to further weaken the standing of unions in the workplace,  which, as we have suggested, brings tangible political benefits.

Although not easily or obviously linked, Howard’s conservative agenda keeps any  real focus on progressive alternatives—best articulated by unions—at the margins of  political debate. This is not to say that Howard’s cultural conservatism serves no other  purpose—it clearly does—but rather it recognises what Hacker and Pierson say of the  American political scene: ‘there is little question that conservatives often use cultural  messages to trump economic ones’ (2005, p. 195).

We have argued that although the Howard Government has pursued a conservative  agenda that it is unlikely to change the deeper aspirations and values of the Australian  public. We claim its success is not found in Australia’s ready adoption of its  conservative ambitions, but rather in the current strength of the economy and the  declining electoral foundations of its main opponent. We have suggested that the  weakness of the union movement lies at the core of Labor’s electoral problems. Union  decline means that the structural conditions for expressing political alternatives have  been undermined. Labor must hope for a resurgence in union vitality in response to  industrial relations reform, or seek out new constituencies to rebuild its voter base.  That he has forced Labor to compete on his territory—the conservative politics of  prosperity—tells us a lot about Howard’s success.
