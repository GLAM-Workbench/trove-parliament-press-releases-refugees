The Hon Richard Marles MP   Parliamentary Secretary for Pacific Island Affairs



Interview with Adam Spencer, ABC 702 Sydney  Transcript, E&OE

10 October 2011

ADAM SPENCER: The situation is quite dire on the tiny Pacific island of Tuvalu. They are  literally running dry, water supplies are at desperate lows. What's Australia doing to help?

Well, Richard Marles is the Parliamentary Secretary for Pacific Island Affairs, he joins us  now.

Mr Marles, thank you very much for your time. Let's start — where is Tuvalu, for people  who don't know?

RICHARD MARLES: Tuvalu is in the — well, in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. It's in  the south-western Pacific, just this side of the date line, and it's kind of between Fiji and  Samoa.

ADAM SPENCER: And at the moment it's desperately short of water?

RICHARD MARLES: Yeah, this is a very small coral atoll nation. It's hard to imagine these  countries, but they're very thin slithers of land. There's no height to them, the highest level  above sea water would be about three or four metres. There's no rivers in Tuvalu, there's no  capacity to have dams and they're incredibly exposed to the effects of climate change. The  most obvious of those, or the first challenge, is about water security. They've had the second-worst drought they have experienced and that has now led to a critical shortage of water.

ADAM SPENCER: How little water do they have? How much water are they trying to get  through on a day, at the moment?

RICHARD MARLES: At the moment they're trying to survive on about 40 litres a day per  household.

Now the international recognised minimum is about 25 litres per day per person, so this is  less than that.

I spoke to our person in Tuvalu about 10 minutes ago, and morale there is obviously not  good. That's not much water at all to deal with.

But, we are hopeful that we'll be able to get, in combination with our friends in New Zealand,  a portable desalination plant through to the main island of Funafuti today.

An RAAF C-17 Globemaster will be taking off from Auckland today with that desalination  plant on board. As I say, in tandem with a New Zealand Air Force plane, the plan is to get  that unit to Funafuti today.

ADAM SPENCER: Is it true that there are already desal facilities on the island, but they're  in disrepair?

RICHARD MARLES: Yeah, that is true, and so we're also working with the authorities in  Tuvalu to get the expertise on the ground, to make sure that those desal plants are fully  operational.

We did get a portable desal plant, thanks to an Australian-provided patrol boat, through to the  island of Nukulaelae, which is probably the island which has been most severely affected.

There's about 5000 people on Funafuti, that's the capital of Tuvalu. Nukulaelae, which is  nearby, has about 300 people on it, and they do have a desal plant at the moment.

ADAM SPENCER: And is it true that the Government's also been planting mangroves  around the island?

RICHARD MARLES: Look, I haven't heard that, but that wouldn't surprise me, because  mangroves for these coral atoll nations are a kind of natural sea wall.

They also filter the water, so there have been mangrove planting campaigns in places like  Kiribati, which is very similar to Tuvalu, to provide something of a barrier to storm surges,  which is one of the effects of climate change being experienced by these islands.

ADAM SPENCER: I'm talking with Richard Marles, he's the Parliamentary Secretary for  the Pacific Islands. You recently toured with the United Nations Secretary-General, and I  believe the first time the Secretary-General had been to this part of the world, so I guess it  shows in some ways it's on the agenda.

RICHARD MARLES: Yes, it is on the agenda, and I think it was a really important thing to  get Ban Ki-moon out to the Pacific. We went to the Solomon Islands and then to Kiribati.

I think Kiribati and Tuvalu are the two countries really on the front line of climate change. As  I say, there is no height to these islands, they're very thin. For most of the islands, where you  stand, you can see water on both sides. In fact, there are parts of the island of Funafuti where

the width of the island is literally the width of the road, and sea erosion is a big issue there.

We, with the Secretary-General, visited a town where on the king tide, the tide actually  comes into peoples' living rooms, that's a regular event now.

ADAM SPENCER: So, is it likely, in a worst case scenario, could we see climate change  refugees leaving these places, and wanting to come to Australia?

RICHARD MARLES: That is often talked about as a prospect. But I think the priority at the  moment, and certainly the priority when you speak to people from these countries, is to try  and do everything we can now, to make these islands habitable for a very long time to come  and I think that can be achieved.

But we do need to get global funds flowing, to enable that to happen.

Australians should feel proud because there is a thing called the Fast Start Climate Change  Adaptation Program. Around the world, donor communities are committed to that. We've  now committed 80 per cent of the money that we've promised, which is way ahead of the  global average.

But we've got to see the rest of the countries starting to spend money, because they do need to  build sea walls, they do need to deal with that kind of erosion. But most of all, they need to  secure their water supplies, and that's the biggest challenge which we're now experiencing in  Tuvalu today.

ADAM SPENCER: Okay Richard Marles, thank you very much for your time.

RICHARD MARLES: It's a pleasure.

ADAM SPENCER: Richard Marles is the Parliamentary Secretary for the Pacific Island  Affairs. He's been overseeing Australia's relief efforts to Tuvalu, desperate for water.
