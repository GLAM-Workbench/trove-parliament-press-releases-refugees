PM’s chief hatchet man to chair Coastwatch task force

Â

13th April 1999

Â

Â

The Prime Ministers 
Task Force on Coastwatch is hamstrung from day one because its chairman, 
Max ‘the axe’ Moore-Wilton, is the man who slashed funding to law 
enforcement only two years ago,” Shadow Justice and Customs Minister, 
Duncan Kerr said today.

Â

Mr Kerr said appointing 
Mr Moore-Wilton to this important role is like sending the accused In 
as the judge.

Â

“While an inquiry 
may be useful, it could cause further delays in fixing the problem — 
a problem of funding and resources.

Â

“The Government’s 
handling of this entire matter so far has been sloppy. Now, the man 
who slashed law enforcement funding is being asked to report on why 
the performance of Coastwatch is inadequate. The answer would seem obvious 
- even to Mr Moore-Wilton.

Â

“The Government already 
knows what is going on at Customs. It is a crisis of its own creation. 
To further compound the error, it was revealed last night the Federal 
Government had been warned that changes to immigration raised the bar 
so high it would encourage boat people.

Â

“This comes on top 
of a high-level interdepartmental investigation into Coastwatch and 
an Auditor General’s report calling for clear protocols between Coastwatch 
and its client departments.

Â

“But it doesn’t 
stop there. Last year’s Customs Annual Report highlights the reliability 
problems with Coastwatch radars.

Â

“And what do we get 
from the Government - another inquiry.

Â

“This is the inquiry 
into the inquiry, which was called, then broadened, lost its independence, 
and will now be referred to as a Task Force. What a mess.

Â

“By calling yet another 
inquiry, it is clear that the Prime Minister is doing to Amanda Vanstone 
what he did to Philip Ruddock last week - hanging her out to dry.”
