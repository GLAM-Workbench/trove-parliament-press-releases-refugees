STATEMENT BY AUSTRALIAN VOCATIONAL  AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION MINISTER  THE HON GARY HARDGRAVE, MP  September 6, 2006

The Australian Government has no intention of establishing a TAFE  facility or indeed anything resembling it in Africa.

It is however desirable that as much English and other instruction  relating to the Australian lifestyle is provided to refugees chosen for  resettlement in our country before they arrive here.
