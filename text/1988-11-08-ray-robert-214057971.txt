STATEMENT REGARDING BURMESE DIPLOMATS

The Opposition Foreign Affairs spokesman, John Spender, has  released a statement regarding applications from three staff  members of the Burmese Embassy for "political asylum and/or  refugee status".

The Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic  Affairs, Senator Robert Ray, said it was normally Government  policy neither to confirm nor deny the existence of such  applications.

Senator Ray said however that prudent policy had been  pre-empted by Mr Spender's release of copies of  refugee/political asylum applications from the three Burmese  diplomats.

"I only hope Mr Spender had the full consent of the  applicants to release this material and that he fully  explained to them the consequences of its release," the  Minister said.

Senator Ray said to publicise such applications might  prejudice their outcome, or affect the situation of the  people involved.

He said applications for refugee status wereÂ· dealt with on  an individual case by case basis.

Applications for political asylum are considered by the  Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.

Applications for refugee status would be considered by the  Determination of Refugee Status (DORS) committee.

The DORS committee consists of representatives of the  Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic  Affairs, the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, the  Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Attorney

General1s department.

The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for  Refugees also participates as an adviser.
