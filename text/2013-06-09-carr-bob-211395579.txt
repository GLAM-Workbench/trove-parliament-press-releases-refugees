Subjects: issues of people smuggling, Chinese cyber threats and  other foreign affairs matters.

9 June 2013

KATHRYN ROBINSON: The leaders of China and the United States  have held talks in California in a bid to shore up relations amid  allegations of cyber-attacks and surveillance. A Pentagon report has  pinned recent cyber-security breaches on the Chinese Government  and military.

But there are also concerns about China's actions in Australia in  recent weeks, with reports ASIO was targeted in an online attack,  something the Government has refused to confirm.

Joining us now is Foreign Minister Bob Carr, Minister thank you for  your time this morning.

BOB CARR: Pleasure to be with you.

KATHRYN ROBINSON: Now can we address the elephant in the  room? You agreed to come in on this program today if we didn't  speak about the Labor leadership.

BOB CARR: Yes.

KATHRYN ROBINSON: Have you taken a vow of silence, what's going  on?

BOB CARR: Look, anything I say in this atmosphere, with the sort of  stuff you read in the Sunday papers, is going to be elevated on the  news tonight. I want the focus to be in this interview on the  Australian position on foreign affairs.

I try to steer away from talking about domestic politics. If I so much  as nod in the direction of any suggestion you give me on domestic  politics, that's a headline, not only on 10 but on all the other stations  tonight.

KATHRYN ROBINSON: Okay, so we probably won't go any further  with that one. Let's talk about the US China talks which are  happening at the moment, just how important are these for Australia  and what do you expect to come out of them?

BOB CARR: Well that's a good starting point, because Australia has  got a deep interest in good relations between the United States and  China. And we're not unique in that, so do the other countries of the  region. Indeed it could be said that a nightmare for Australia, for  nations of ASEAN, would be to have a breakdown in what is the most  important bilateral relationship in the world today, between China  and the United States.

So when we say we're pleased that these great powers are meeting,  we're really saying the same thing that someone in Singapore or

Indonesia would be saying - someone anywhere in the ASEAN world,  the 10 nations to our north.

STEFANIE BALOGH: We've obviously worked on our relationship with  China. In April the Prime Minister signed a historic pact to have direct  talks with Beijing. Has a date yet been set for the first sort of historic  meeting that will come out of that?

BOB CARR: No but the agreement was to have that guaranteed  meeting, at the highest levels of our respective leaderships, once a  year. It'd be a little premature to settle on that.

But the point is that it's a recognition by China of how serious the  relationship with Australia is. They have this understanding with very  few other countries. There was one view I had from a thinktank  once, that the Chinese regard us as little more important than New  Zealand, a good deal less important than Canada. And when I read  that I thought this couldn't be the case.

So what the Prime Minister put to the Chinese leadership over the  last six or nine months, was going to be a test of it. Whether the  Chinese would concede that Australia's more important than some  of us were advised we were being regarded as.

And so we were very pleased, the Prime Minister and I were very  very pleased to have the Australia-China relationship elevated to  strategic partnership.

DENNIS ATKINS: Will the Australian people see real benefits from  that? Will there be things that we can point to and say, this is the  product of this kind of increased importance in the relationship?

BOB CARR: I think you'll see an enhancement of the relationship  across the board. I rang our ambassador Frances Adamson only two  days after I returned from China. And she told me there was a vice-

chancellor of an Australian university up there, and he said that even  within that week of the Prime Minister's meeting with the Chinese  leadership, he noticed he was being treated very differently. The  Chinese bureaucracy takes its cue from the stance of its leaders, and  with its President and its Prime Minister saying we regard the  relationship with Australia as this important, right across the  bureaucracy you get a different response.

I think business will notice it, universities will notice it, the whole  service sector, which is growing more important. And without a  doubt the Australian companies that are embedded in the Chinese  economy, meeting their need for resource security will notice it.

STEFANIE BALOGH: Foreign Minister one of the talking points for the  US and China talks is cyber-security. If I could just move to the  revelations out of the US on the data mining, should Australians be  concerned?

BOB CARR: We've got to have cyber-security as high on our list of  concerns. Our white paper on Australian security earlier this year  spelt that out. For the first time, in a white paper on security threats  to Australia, we were designating cyber as a matter of real and  present concern.

STEFANIE BALOGH: Would Australians' information - they use,  obviously they use the big technology companies that have been  handing over data to the national security in America, should  Australians be concerned that their data could have been spied on?

BOB CARR: I wouldn't think so. We've all got to assess this  controversy out of America for what it is. I think America is striving to  meet the balance between the demands of security in the wake of  September 11, and the demands of privacy. There's no country that

takes the right of its citizens more seriously than America, with that  focus through its bill of rights and its Supreme Court on where  individuals stand in relation to government.

I think Americans will always struggle to get this balance right. But in  the end it's a lively political system in America, and a congressman or  a senator standing up saying the rights of my constituents have been  violated here, is a very strong voice.

DENNIS ATKINS: But the US President has said that American citizens  have nothing to fear from the national security agency going through  the material from the internet companies?

He says it's only foreigners. Now, wouldn't that include  Australians…?

BOB CARR: I'd need to get advice on that, I don't want to make a  snap judgement. I sense this controversy has got a long way to go in  America, and it would give us an opportunity to thoroughly examine  that.

DENNIS ATKINS: Well in Britain, just overnight, there have been  questions raised about the role of the GCHQ, the British intelligence  centre. The joint facilities at Pine Gap in Australia, one of the major  tenants there is the National Security Agency, will you be seeking  advice on whether the NSA is using Pine Gap in any of these Patriot  Act related activities?

BOB CARR: Well just to repeat what I said a moment ago, this  controversy has got a long way to go. We'll examine carefully any  implications in what has emerged for the security and the privacy of  Australians.

STEFANIE BALOGH: Foreign Minister can I ask you about Syria, you  have a proposal where you could breach a peace deal leaving the

Assad regime in place. Have you received any support for this? How  are the Americans…?

BOB CARR: Yeah I think it's being absorbed. In the lead-up to what's  called Geneva two, the important thing is to get Russia and America  comfortable with negotiating. Therefore in a position to bring the  domestic parties to this shocking civil war together for negotiations.

If it is necessary to accept that Assad will be there for the start of the  process, as opposed to being entrenched in government at the end  of the process, then I would think this is something that the west  ought to be conceding to get Russia there. And with Russia, the  Assad Government.

I've been in refugee camps in Jordan, I was there last year, Al-Za'atri  refugee camp, it must have grown by 100 times since I was there. I  spoke to refugees in Lebanon, and I think the Lebanese people  deserve to be praised to the skies for the burden they are carrying. If  Australia were carrying the refugee burden that Lebanon has got,  we'd have five and a half million refugees on our soil. And the  Lebanese are looking after these people, getting them food, giving  them emergency accommodation, even taking them into their  homes. The Lebanese deserve to be praised to the skies for what  they're doing.

But my conversations with these refugees just confirm that this is an  unparalleled humanitarian catastrophe. These people don't know  whether their homes are standing. Their homes are probably not  standing. You saw the photos out of Qusayr the other day; street  after street of ruined, collapsed housing. They say that by the end of  this year the homes of 9 million people, out of a population of 22  million, will have been demolished.

And you've got a huge displaced population in the country as well as  a population streaming over the borders in Jordan and Lebanon and  Turkey every night.

KATHRYN ROBINSON: Mm, it's a terrible situation there at the  moment. Senator…

BOB CARR: I'll just share with you my impatience with the way the  world views it. I've gone hoarse in the last six months saying to world  leaders that given that there's still a deadlock over a political  solution, let's agree on a bare minimum agreement to get medicine  into the country.

Because people - someone in Aleppo or Damascus whose got an  ordinary medical condition, quite apart from a wound or a trauma -  are not able to get the medicine for the heart disease, or an  inoculation for their youngsters. 90 per cent of the medicine used to  come inside the country, but now that's been destroyed and doctors  and nurses are being shot dead in the foyers of hospitals because  they're alleged to have treated someone from the other side the day  before.

This is - they're simply not getting medicines, doctors and nurses are  being slaughtered, they're forced to flee the country. There used to  be thousands of doctors in Aleppo, there're now 35 left.

I want the world to arrive at a pact that says before we agree on a  ceasefire, or a democratic political transition in the country, let's at  least agree that medical convoys can get in, that doctors and nurses  won't be slaughtered, and that hospitals won't be used as bases, or  targeted.

KATHRYN ROBINSON: Okay Senator we do need to take a break right  there. But do stay with us, we look at the issue of turning back the  boats with Foreign Minister Bob Carr.

KATHRYN ROBINSON: You're watching Meet the Press. A rescue  mission is still underway off the coast of Christmas Island where an  asylum seeker boat has capsized with 70 people on board. Nine  bodies have already been recovered. The vessel was first reported  missing almost two days before authorities began the search,  prompting fresh criticism of the way Australia responds to boats in  distress.

Our guest today is Foreign Minister Bob Carr. Senator, you said that  under a Tony Abbott-led government of turning - the policy of  turning back the boats, that would create a foreign policy disaster.  Don't we already have a foreign policy disaster on our hands with  these lives being lost at sea?

BOB CARR: Well first of all the information about this is just coming  in. Let's express the hope that people are rescued and we haven't  got this tragedy that's being described to us now as a possibility.  Let's hope the number of lives lost can at least be minimised.

Let's analyse what's going on here, and that is we've got a people  smuggling racket that's entrenched. And people are coming here, not  now as a result of persecution, but because they're economic  refugees who've paid money to people smugglers. There's been a  spike in people coming from Iran for example. Not claiming  persecution, it's the economic pressure of the sanctions in Iran and  the squeeze on living standards. People in these circumstances think  if we give $10,000 to a people smuggler in a port in Indonesia, he will  get us into Australian waters. That is the essence of this, that's the  essence of it.

STEFANIE BALOGH: Given that, given the push factors have changed  slightly, isn't Laurie Ferguson correct in saying that Labor's dead in  Western Sydney unless this issue's addressed?

BOB CARR: The people want this resolved, there's no argument  about it. They want it resolved. They don't like the idea of Australia  having a big and generous immigration program, something that's  served this country well, and it being disrupted by people smugglers.

As by people who are saying don't worry about the regular process  of immigration, we'll get you into Australian waters if you give us the  money. In all of this the wretchedness is being caused, is being  delivered by people who are running sophisticated businesses. This is  not amateur-land, this is people who have got a business model of  recruiting economic migrants who want to come into Australian  waters.

DENNIS ATKINS: It's been now over six months since the  Government began implementing the recommendations of the  Houston Panel on this issue. But we haven't seen any slowing down  in the rate of the boats arriving and the numbers on the boats, there  are now regularly boats with more than 200 people on them.

When will we start to see some results from those recommendations  that Angus Houston and his panel put forward?

BOB CARR: Well Dennis you've got about 4 million people on the  loose in Asia - 4 million people who are displaced or in the hands of  people traffickers. The pressures are great, and they're not going to  go away.

The Government could be changed tomorrow, Tony Abbott could be  made prime minister tomorrow, and the problem of people  smugglers bringing desperate people into our waters will continue.

Now, I've got to say, without those recommendations of Angus  Houston's panel that we put into place, the message we sent  through the offshore processing, this would be worse than it is.  There'd be more people risking their lives on boats. We sent a  powerful message, but of course the pressures at the other end, the  push factors, continue to be strong.

DENNIS ATKINS: And with Tony Abbott's approach, Kevin Rudd said  on Friday that his message that he will turn back the boats was just a  lie. Is Kevin Rudd right there?

BOB CARR: He is right, it is a lie. The idea that a boat with 200 people  on it, delivered into Australian waters be a people smuggler, can  simply be told to turn around and go back to Indonesia. Or that  Australian border security forces are going to be able to cart it to an  Indonesian port, is a fantasy.

Now, the key is whether Tony Abbott has pressed on with this. I've  seen him beat a retreat to say they'd do it only when it's safe, they'd  do it only in some circumstances, they'd give it a try. Now that's a  whole lot weaker than that simple slogan that he's trying to gull the  Australian people with, "I'll turn back the boats."

STEFANIE BALOGH: Does that slogan come up in discussions that you  or DFAT have with the Indonesians? Do they discuss Tony Abbott's  plans and tell you anything…

BOB CARR: Well no, they've said publicly Stefanie what their position  is. Namely, that they won't accept it. The Indonesian position is that  they see themselves as a transit nation. You've got Iranians  increasingly, people from Afghanistan, people from elsewhere,  coming through Indonesia to reach Australia. And they think it unfair  to them if Australia, by some mechanism - I don't know how Tony

Abbott pretends he's going to do it - simply directs boats back to  Indonesian ports.

DENNIS ATKINS: Another issue which is reportedly causing some  concern in the region is the Australian Government's crackdown on  457 visas. Is that ever raised with you in your talks with…?

BOB CARR: I've never had it raised with me, no. I think all countries  have got their own immigration procedures, and they recognise that  Australia's got a high humanitarian intake. Higher than any other  nation except the United States.

I think they recognise as well that Australia's got a non-discriminatory immigration program. Australia gets good marks for  being a multicultural society and for running a strong immigration  program over the years. We've got nothing to be defensive about.  And it hasn't been raised with me.

KATHRYN ROBINSON: Senator before we go this morning we'd like  to get your comments on Nelson Mandela, I would imagine that your  thoughts are with his family with the news that he's been readmitted  to hospital overnight, and I guess his contribution to South Africa and  the global community?

BOB CARR: The thing that stands out about Nelson Mandela is his  commitment to reconciliation. People put him in jail where he was  cruelly treated, especially in the early years on Robben Island. And  yet he was able to walk out of that experience and not direct  thoughts of hatred or vengeance at the representatives of a white-supremacist regime.

And I think that's a beacon of hope to those of us who'd like to get  peace in the Middle East. If it could happen there after the decades  of Government based on racial discrimination, then surely there's

hope on the Westbank, on the Gaza Strip and, to be very ambitious,  hope for a reconciliation in Syria.

KATHRYN ROBINSON: Foreign Minister Bob Carr thank you for  joining us today on Meet the Press.

BOB CARR: My pleasure, thank you.
