TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW - SKY NEWS AM AGENDA WITH KIERAN GILBERT

SUBJECT: BUDGET 2011; REGIONAL COOPERATION FRAMEWORK.

E  & O E - PROOF ONLY

JOURNALIST:  We've got with us in the lead up to Mr Swan's news conference, the  Finance Minister Penny Wong, who has worked very closely with the Treasurer over the  last few weeks.

Senator, thank you very much for your time.

WONG: Good morning.

JOURNALIST: You've had to obviously stand up to your ministerial colleagues who come  up with spending proposals in the lead up to this Budget, including also the Prime Minister,  you've had to stand up to her apparently.  Did you win those arguments?

WONG: Well, I don't think the Prime Minister ever needs convincing about the need to  come back to surplus.  It's something she has articulated very clearly and she's absolutely  been committed to do that. Both in terms of the decisions we have made but also to explain  to the Australian people why we need to come back to surplus, as we see this mining boom  gather pace in the years ahead.

JOURNALIST: But in terms of the ministerial colleagues, obviously they have plans within  their portfolios.  We'll come back to you in just a moment Minister Wong.  We're going to  cross now to the Treasurer, Wayne Swan.

[cross to the Treasurer’s press conference]

JOURNALIST: Treasurer Wayne Swan there on the eve of his fourth Budget. With me  before and still here in the studio, the Finance Minister, Senator Penny Wong. So let’s go -  if we can go through some of those issues first. The Low Income Tax Offset, bringing it  forward. How much does that hit the bottom line, if at all?

WONG: Oh well, what it is, is bringing forward the tax offset so that people get more of it  each week, rather than just at the end of the year. So currently this tax break, which is for

2



low income Australians, you get some of it in your weekly pay, or fortnightly pay, and you  get some of it at the end of the year. What we’re doing is increasing the amount that you  can get each week.

Now it’s not - we’re not pretending this is an enormous amount of money. It is a modest  amount to help with the weekly, fortnightly and monthly bills that people get, so people get  more - can get more money in their pocket.

JOURNALIST: And is there any shift to the bottom line or it doesn’t cost anything or is it  just reworking the money?

WONG: Obviously, you’re bringing forward the effective tax expenditure because you’re  bringing forward it during the year rather than the end of the year. But it’s a sensible  measure. Look, we doubled this Low Income Tax Offset since we’ve been in Government.  And that’s a good thing because it’s about directly targeting low income families and low  income Australians.

JOURNALIST: It is modest though, isn’t it? It’s not a lot of money. Is this more symbolism  to say, look, we get it, we understand that there are cost of living pressures?

WONG: Well I think for someone on $30,000, it’s about $300 through the year. And as I  said, it is a modest amount. But you know we understand that every bit counts, particularly  if you’re a low income family. And this is our policy which is about trying to make sure  people have more money as and when they need it.

JOURNALIST: But this is the first Budget in eight years that there haven't been tax cuts.   You need to show you’re doing something, don’t you?

WONG: Kieran, I don’t think we have pretended that there aren’t difficult decisions in this  Budget.  The cost of living pressures that people are experiencing out there, we have done  a lot within our means to assist them in past budgets.  We’ve delivered tax cuts, we’ve  delivered increases in the Child Care Rebate.  And also, as Jenny Macklin reminded us,  we’ve ensured the Family Tax Benefit can be paid to those families where there are  teenagers who are studying. That’s a participation - a learning or educational incentive as  well as support for families.

JOURNALIST: It’s a re-announcement though, isn’t it?  That was a re-announcement  because it was committed to the election.

WONG: It was delivering on an election commitment.

JOURNALIST: Yeah but really that was budgeted previously wasn’t it?  So it’s not -

WONG: We still have to find the room for it. You see, unlike Mr Hockey, we actually have to  offset our spending. And this goes to the issue, I think you were starting to ask me before  we broke to go to Wayne’s press conference; the Treasurer’s press conference. We’ve had  to make room for these spending initiatives.  That’s our commitment.

Just as we offset new spending during the campaign, that’s the approach we’ve taken  through this Budget.  And you’ll see tomorrow the fact that we have, in accordance with our

3



priorities as a Government - Labor priorities - made the room for the spending  commitments that we’ve made.

JOURNALIST: Minister, that’s obviously your job in a large part to find the cuts.  Was it  difficult or, you know, was it difficult to rein in the colleagues in spending portfolios or did  they understand that, yes it is a tough climate, they’ve got to rein it in?

WONG: I think colleagues, the caucus, understands why we have to come back to surplus.   It’s a responsible thing to do.  We don’t want to add to price pressures as this mining boom  gathers pace.

JOURNALIST: But ministers are still going to pitch up ideas, aren’t they?

WONG: Well having said that, having said that of course everybody would like their policy  funded. And we’ve had to make choices that are based on our priorities, and the priorities  which are economic priorities and Labor priorities.

JOURNALIST: Joe Hockey says that there’s one big hole in this Budget and we heard the  Treasurer respond to it.  But really we’re not going to get the detail till the Mid-Year  Economic Outlook, which is at the end of the year, on the carbon tax.  So this is a Budget  with a shadow hanging over it.

WONG: Joe Hockey says a lot of things and very few of them actually have any substance  and this is one of them.  And the Treasurer’s outlined the history for example of Prime  Minister Howard who didn’t put the GST or his emissions trading scheme into his Budget for  prior to the election.

JOURNALIST: So because he does it, you can do it?

WONG: No, no because the point is you need to put the numbers in after you have made  decisions about the design of the scheme, including what will the carbon price be and so  forth.  And we will do that just as we have previously done it.

This is just another furphy from Mr Hockey.  He was trying to distract attention from two  things.  One is his $11 billion black hole.  The fact that he would be in deficit were he the  Treasurer of this country in every year of the budget estimates.

He also is trying to distract attention from his boast earlier this week that the Coalition will  bring back the budget to surplus - bring the budget back to surplus a year early.  Well we  look forward to Mr Abbott on Thursday showing us how that will happen.

JOURNALIST: But Joe Hockey’s comments to one side, if you look at the substance of  this, it’s a Budget that’s coming in the lead up to one very significant reform.  It does mean  that there is a shadow over the revenue projection, the expenditure, the inflation forecast.

WONG: I simply don’t agree and remember we have -

JOURNALIST: But the carbon tax’s going to have a significant -

WONG: Hang on, hang on.

JOURNALIST: ...impact on inflation, on everything.

WONG: Kieran, I don’t agree. I think that is a proposition that Mr Hockey puts forward  because he has no sound costings and savings to put forward of his own.  We know he is  delivering a black hole, that’s what he as shadow Treasurer is delivering.

We have said as the Government our intention on the carbon price is that it is broadly  budget neutral.  And as the Treasurer said again today, when decisions are made we will  account for it.  We will be responsible.

JOURNALIST: The first priority the Treasurer also said was to train Australians first.  But  given the unemployment forecast down to 4.5 per cent apparently over the next couple of  years, and given the demand for skilled workers in Queensland, WA - the mining states.   The reports today that you’re going to boost skilled migration to regional areas, it was  almost inevitable that you had to do that, wasn’t it?

WONG: Well as the Treasurer said, we’ll announce the details of our migration program  tomorrow.  But I would say this: these are some of the examples of the sort of capacity  constraints and the pressures that the mining boom will impose. And that’s why we have to  do what we’re doing, bring the budget back to surplus but train Australians and get more  Australians in work.  And that is very much what this budget is focused on.

JOURNALIST: But skilled migration’s also a very important part isn’t it to satisfy the  capacity, the demands for labour in the mining sector particularly?

WONG: We’re very conscious of the needs of the mining sector, the needs of the economy  when it comes to workers and this is a Budget that’s very much focused on that.

JOURNALIST: So is it all done and dusted, the Budget?  This is your first.

WONG: This is my first, yes.

JOURNALIST: And how did you find it?  Much sleep, is it all wrapped up?

WONG: Look it’s the day before so I think it’s pretty much set; set to go.

JOURNALIST: And how was it in terms of the workload - must have been quite a rugged  few weeks?

WONG: There’s a lot of things to get across but you work very closely with the Treasurer  and he works enormously hard.  And while I’m able to say something on TV, I do want to  say there are staff and public servants in my Department, in Treasury, and across the  Government who’ve worked extraordinarily hard and we do thank them for their work.

JOURNALIST: One last issue if I can before you go and this is a story that emerged over  the weekend, the deal with Malaysia on asylum seekers.  You were born in Malaysia.  What  do you think of their track record on human rights?

WONG: On this issue I think Chris Bowen has made very clear the nature of Malaysia’s

5



agreement in terms of how it will treat these asylum seekers, including not returning those  who return to Malaysia to countries where they may be persecuted.  Now that is an  important undertaking and agreement from Malaysia.

This is a tough policy area and the only person who pretends there’s an easy solution is  Tony Abbott because he wants people to believe it.  But I think people know this is a tough  policy area, we need a regional approach because no one country can deal with this on its  own.  So this agreement with Malaysia is a very important part of that regional approach.

JOURNALIST: But their human rights record isn’t that good is it?  And also they’re not a  signatory to the UN Convention on Refugees?

WONG: One of the principle things in the UN Convention is the principle of not returning  people to places where they may be persecuted.  And as I’ve said, Malaysia’s made  undertakings on that basis.  We also have the UNHCR involved in dealing with those  asylum seekers who are returned to Malaysia.

JOURNALIST: Finance Minister Penny Wong, thanks for your time.

WONG: Good to be with you.
