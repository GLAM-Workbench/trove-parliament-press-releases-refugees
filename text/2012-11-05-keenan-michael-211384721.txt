Michael Keenan MP - Federal Member for  Stirling 6 BOATS CARRYING 429 PEOPLE IN 72  HOURS  November 05, 2012

Boat arrivals continue to escalate at an unrelenting rate with six boats, carrying 429 people, arriving illegally on Australia’s  shores in the last three days alone, Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and Border Protection Michael Keenan said.

“In the first five days of November the people smugglers have already managed to successfully smuggle 486 people and  seven boats to Australia - that means the Government’s estimated budget for the month has been filled in just seven  days,” Mr Keenan said.

“This Government has proven to the people smugglers time and time again that they do not have the resolve or the  courage to put an end to this lucrative criminal trade that has overrun our borders.

“Labor does not have the credibility to enforce the necessary tough border protection policies to stop the boats from  coming.

“The Labor Party themselves are the road block to getting any resolution to this border protection crisis,” Mr Keenan said.
