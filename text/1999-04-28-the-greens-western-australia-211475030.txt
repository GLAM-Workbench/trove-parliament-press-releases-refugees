SENATOR MARGETTS ASKS WHAT GOVERNMENT WILL 
DO WITH EAST TIMORESE REFUGEES

Â

28 Apri l 1999

Â

Today in the Senate, Senator Margetts asked the Minister 
representing the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, 
Senator Amanda Vanstone:

Â

Can the Minister tell me, given the deteriorating 
human rights situation in East Timor, and give  n the Government’s current policy of not accepting people fleeing 
from East Timor as eligible for refugee status in Australia, what intentions 
does the government have in relation to East Timorese people arriving 
at Australia ‘s borders seeking refugee status in this country?

Â

Can the Minister guarantee that East Timorese 
fleeing the Territory

will not be automatically detained or deported 
on arrival in

Australia if they have inappropriate documentation? 
And what plans does the Australian Government have to   facilitate the processing of visa applications in East Timor for 
those seeking protection in Australia, given the need for an expedited 
process?

Â

It was indicated that answers will be given on notice.

Â

“Whilst I recognise the need for the Minister to 
receive advice before answering my questions, I am looking forward to 
a positive response from the government”, Senator Margetts said.

Â

“Currently the Australian government would be in 
a bind to receive refugees from East Timor, since the government considers 
East Timorese people to be able to avail themselves of the protection 
of Portugal.

Â

“Australia should be opening its doors to those 
fleeing persecution in East Timor, and now is the opportunity for a 
change in government policy to bring this about.”
