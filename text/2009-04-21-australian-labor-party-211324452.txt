INTERVIEW WITH SABRA LANE  ABC Radio AM Program

21 April 2009

E&OE

SUBJECTS:       Recession; IMF Forecasts

LANE:                  When you forecast information, does the Government have to make a  recession declaration now?

TREASURER:      Well, what we can say is that growth is slowing dramatically.  We won’t  see the official figures for some time.

LANE:                  Well, the Prime Minister has signalled he wants to talk about a recession  now.  He raised it yesterday.  You’ve backed his admission, but you don’t want to talk about  the specifics. Why?

TREASURER:      We have had a regular and frank discussion with the Australian people  over months.  I said back in March, as the Prime Minister said back in March, that it was  almost inevitable.

LANE:                  Well, how long and deep will the recession be?

TREASURER:      What we can do is put our forecast out, as we do in the Budget.  What we  can do is to take into account the forecast from bodies such as the IMF, and we are having  further forecasts from the IMF later this week.

LANE:                  How long and deep will the recession be?

TREASURER:      I can’t do those forecasts on your program this morning.  What I can be is  frank with the Australian people about the magnitude of the global recession, the fact that  seven of our 10 largest trading partners are already in recession, about the fact that the IMF is  about to further downgrade its growth forecast.  It’s important we talk to the Australian

people about the impact of this global recession on our domestic economy.  But it’s also  important in the context of that discussion that we underline the strengths in the Australian  economy, because out of all the developed economies in the world, there’s one that most  people would want to be in - and it still remains the Australian economy.

LANE:                  Mr Swan, Mr Rudd uttered the recession word yesterday after carefully  avoiding it for months.  His office issued a partial transcript of that speech yesterday  afternoon to draw attention to it.  You admitted late last week the Government’s financial

forecast issued in February will be substantially worse off on Budget night.  The Opposition  says the Government’s admitting all this information now to deflect attention from the  asylum seeker issue.  Is that what you’re doing?

TREASURER:      That is completely ridiculous and demonstrates just how desperate the  Opposition have become.  You know, they don’t get up very early in the morning, this  Opposition.  Both the Prime Minister and I have been saying for some time that it’s inevitable  there will be a period of negative growth.  But what we have to wait to see are the official  forecasts on Budget night, are the official figures for the National Accounts which come  later.  But what we can do is acknowledge the forecasts of international bodies, and we’re  about to see further forecasts from the International Monetary Fund.  All of those are likely to  further downgrade growth in the Australian economy.
