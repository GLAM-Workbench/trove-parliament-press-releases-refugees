E&OE……………………….…………………………………………………………………

STEVE PRICE:

Good morning to you.

TONY ABBOTT:

G’day Steve.

ANDREW BOLT:

Is this the return of the Pacific Solution, Tony?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, it’s a very selective and partial return and while I suppose it’s good to see the Gillard Government  dragged kicking and screaming in the direction of better policies, on its own it’s not going to stop the boats  and it’s not going end the protests because we’ve got 6,500 people in immigration detention at the moment.  There’s no way that all of them can go to Manus Island and the boats will keep coming, unless in addition to  Manus we’ve got Nauru reopened, we’ve got temporary protection visas reinstituted to all people who come  illegally by boat and we reserve the right to turn boats around where it can be done safely.

STEVE PRICE:

What about the gross hypocrisy, though? You will well remember the vitriol that the former government  under John Howard copped for having a Pacific Solution at all. Do you think all of those critics - Julian  Burnside and people like that - will be out today, screaming from the rooftops about how inhumane it is?

TONY ABBOTT:

I suspect they might find good pragmatic reasons to support it but it is interesting, I mean, Julia Gillard was  the loudest of all in her condemnation of the absolute racism of the Howard Government, the fact that this  was an absolute affront to human rights, it was a betrayal of everything that was decent and true and good  and of course, now it will be justified in the name of protecting our borders. So, you’re right. This is a

complete confession of failure and it’s really an admission that everything they said for years was hopeless  sanctimony.

ANDREW BOLT:

Well, it’s interesting you raise the thing. We’ve got 6,500 people in detention. What are they going to do? Is  there going to be huge ships and jumbo jets flying them all over to Manus Island or wherever Papua New  Guinea agrees to build this new place?

STEVE PRICE:

I don’t think they can move those that are existing, already on the mainland. I don’t think they can do that,  can they Mr Abbott?

TONY ABBOTT:

Let’s see what they’ve got in mind. As I said, this is an admission of failure. It’s a confession that they got it  wrong all along. Let’s wait and see what evolves but the point I make is that in the end the only way to  address this problem is to stop the boats and you can’t stop the boats by cherry-picking one or two good  ideas from the Coalition’s policies, you’ve got to adopt the whole lot, holus-bolus, and if you are going to  adopt the Coalition’s policies, why not just admit defeat, surrender and hand over the government to the  Coalition?

ANDREW BOLT:

Well, we would actually laugh about this but the fact is, of course, that in the meantime up to 200 people  have died at sea since the Government relaxed the boat people laws and encouraged the boat people trade  again, so that’s really a tragedy.

TONY ABBOTT:

This is so right, Andrew and look, this is the horrible things that can be done in the name of compassion and  here they were, beating their chests and rending their garments and saying that they were going to be so  much more compassionate than the former government and consequences of the boats coming again have  been people…

STEVE PRICE:

Well I have a suspicion that Andrew might find some of those quotes from back then.

ANDREW BOLT:

They’re on the blog already. I wouldn’t delay it for a second. Can I just ask you, Tony, it’s not in your  particular beat but I’m really fascinated by this kerfuffle about whether the US should release the photos of  Osama bin Laden to settle the debate. I mean, they’ve really stuffed up the public relations, first saying he’d  been armed and then he wasn’t armed and then he’d hidden behind a wife and then it wasn’t, that they’d  watched it, they didn’t, the link was down. Do you think now the controversy should be ended by showing  the photos?

TONY ABBOTT:

Andrew, in the end, I think the good news is that Osama bin Laden has been brought to justice. That’s the  good news and all the rest of it is just, I think, well, you know, it’s sort of the post-match shouting, if you  like. Now, I mean, the question of releasing the photos should be determined by what’s in the best interests

of the democratic countries; what’s in the best interests of those who are prosecuting the war against terror,  because if releasing the photos is going to help the cause of terrorism, it shouldn’t be done. If it’s going to  help the cause of the fight against terror, well, do it…

ANDREW BOLT:

Your gut feeling?

TONY ABBOTT:

My gut feeling is that it’s not necessary and I would trust the judgement of the people who’ve seen the  photos who are prosecuting the fight and I’d let them make the call.

STEVE PRICE:

I was just talking to Climate Change Minister Greg Combet. He announced yesterday they are going to cut  their solar panel benefits scheme by $1,000 per household because it’s making electricity too expensive.  How absurd is that?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, there is a real problem and look, you know, renewable energy is a good thing but it is much more  expensive than coal-fired or gas-fired power and I think we’ve got to face up to that fact and there is no  doubt that the Government’s policies have driven up the price of power and this is even before the  imposition of the carbon tax, which will make a bad situation so very much worse.

STEVE PRICE:

Well, they are saying that we’ve got to have a carbon tax and you’ve all got to think about using solar power  and alternative energy but at the same time it’s going to make it more expensive. That’s just the crux of the  whole argument, isn’t it?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, it’s a very, very good point. I mean, if they can’t have solar panels because that’s going to make  electricity more expensive why are they whacking on a carbon tax, which is going to make electricity more  expensive?

ANDREW BOLT:

That’s the whole point of the damn thing.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, that’s right. I mean, if they don’t make electricity more expensive, they don’t drive the change away  from emitting activities and this is the, I think, the folly at the heart of the Government’s policies.

ANDREW BOLT:

I was really struck by the picture of you going up to the Pilbara, literally drinking Labor’s beer, Tony, and  you know putting the squeeze on the unions to say, well look, you’re not representing your own members  who are very upset about this carbon dioxide tax. I saw Doug Cameron, who is a Labor senator, used to be  head of one of the unions, the AMWU, in a speech, I think it was overnight, saying he’d been bombarded  with letters from union members saying they don’t want this tax. He goes on to say, we should have it. I

4



mean, Labor seems to be squeezed here, dreadfully imposing on its members they very thing that they  oppose.

TONY ABBOTT:

And decent union officials are starting to stand up for their members. I mean, large sections of the Australian  Workers’ Union, the regional officials are in revolt against the Labor Government’s policies and I think  parts of the AMWU, parts of the CFMEU are starting to come around to that position as well because in the  end a decent union official is interested in the welfare of the workers. He’s not interested in his Labor Party  preselection. He supports the workers, more than he supports his future Labor Party preselection and these  are the people who are now starting to speak out. The interesting thing is we’ve even got some of the state  Labor premiers expressing reservations. We had Premier Bligh in Queensland say that she could understand  why people had reservations and so did she. Lara Giddings in Tasmania has refused to back the carbon tax.  We had the Northern Territory Parliament, including Labor members, vote to exempt the Northern Territory  from the carbon tax for 50 years. Now, plainly there is a grassroots revolt breaking out inside the Labor  Party and it’s spreading to some of the more aware leaders of the party.

STEVE PRICE:

I know you’ve got to go. Andrew just wants to know whether you can help him out on a little TV show on  Sunday. Is there any chance?

TONY ABBOTT:

Yeah, look, I think, I’m looking forward to it. I’m in the Mothers Day run but I think we are going to talk  before the run, so I am looking forward to it, Andrew.

ANDREW BOLT:

Well, I am very grateful to you. I’m working on really hard questions to prove that I’m not a Liberal stooge.  Boy, have T got a snooker for you.

TONY ABBOTT:

Oh, God. Now you’ve got me worried.

ANDREW BOLT:

Oh, no, no. Wait, wait, I’m going to let you have the floor. Please come on.

TONY ABBOTT:

Ok. Alright.

STEVE PRICE:

Good on you. Thanks for your time

TONY ABBOTT:

Thanks, Steve.
