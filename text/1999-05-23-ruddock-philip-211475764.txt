TRANSCRIPT 23/5/99

Re: Potential Somali Boat Arrival

Â

Minister:

Â

I wanted to talk to you all about a very serious development 
involving people smuggling.

Â

At the end of last week we received creditable reports 
that people smugglers were engaged in putting together a very large 
clandestine voyage to Australia involving something of the order of 
2,000 people. They were selling places at $2,300US, almost $3,000 Australia 
in Mogadishu, Somali and we put together a strategy to ensure that people 
who were I think being seriously mislead as to what the nature of such 
a voyage would do and achieve. That strategy involved our Australian 
High Commission in Nairobi and a number of other agencies briefing media 
in Somalia and particularly Mogadishu as to what was happening and as 
to what people’s entitlements were if they were intent on entering 
Australia. We encourage people to apply if they thought they had a lawful 
basis of entering Australia at our mission in Nairobi Kenya.

Â

We alerted people that if they did seek to enter Australia 
clandestinely, that is without authority, they were liable to detention 
and if they had no lawful basis for remaining in Australia they would 
be removed and that those that were suggesting otherwise, and I have 
to say they were, were seriously misleading.

Â

Our objective was to ensure that people were properly 
informed were discouraged from this endeavour. There have been, according 
to information available to use, previous attempts, one involving 180 
people who sought to leave via Mogadishu and Yemen and that vessel sank 
- 180 people lost their lives. We believe there was another attempt 
involving a large number of people but it never proceeded.

Â

What we know of our attempts over the weekend to alert 
people to the situation is that there have been large numbers of people 
demanding a return of the money that they had paid. I don’t want to 
describe 1,000 people rather angry in terms that you might imagine, 
but I’m told that it was a large number of people over a thousand, 
seeking the return of funds that had been paid because they had been 
mislead that here were some shots be believe fired at the vessel in 
the port which is some 30 kilometres from Mogadishu. The vessel had 
departed the port.

Â

Now I can’t say that has bought the matter to an 
end, but our efforts have severely hampered any ongoing arrangements 
and I want to make it very clear that people smuggling is a very serious 
matter, the government regards it seriously. We are intent on identifying 
ventures of this sort and ensuring were we can that people don’t depart 
for Australia. We’re also intent on ensuring that we have a comprehensive 
system in place to deal with these matters if we are confronted with 
them. That includes the prompt assessment of claims and the removal 
of people who have no lawful basis to be here. We have demonstrated 
that in the way in which we’ve handled a number of other cases of 
unlawful arrivals of late.

Â

it is important to have in place a comprehensive system. 
It’s of fundamental importance let me say this, top have a system 
in place to ensure that we honour our obligations, because we do have 
certain obligations, but do so quickly and expeditiously and there is 
no place for a system which involves people being detained over a long 
periods of time while we await the decisions of courts where tribunals 
were the appropriate bodies set-up to establish whether or no people 
have bona fide claims. One of the major difficulties we have faced as 
a nation dealing with these matters is the extent to which the unscrupulous 
will point to delay that can sometimes be occasioned by the steps that 
people take to try and test the system as achieving a successful outcome. 
It hasn’t achieved in most cases a successful outcome for the applicant 
but if the fact is that people are here for a period of time they are 
able to distort what is in fact occurring and suggest that they are 
able to obtain outcomes that the system is not delivering.

Â

Tape ends...

Â

In relation to many matters involving people who have 
entered Australia in the past the outcomes that they are able to achieve, 
particularly when the refugee convention is being the subject of very 
considerable testing does lead to unrealistic expectations and does 
mean that people who are here are often involved in providing information 
that is distinctly unhelpful to those abroad.

Â

Question:

Â

Is this the beginning of the people-smuggling season?

Â

Minister:

Â

It is fair to say it ebbs and flows and when we are 
able to deal with these matters promptly and quickly it does have a 
significant impact and that if you look at the decisions that were taken 
in relation to the two boat arrivals that arrived clandestinely in Nambucca 
Heads and in Cairns Holloway’s Beach, in both cases people were unable 
to make claims that gave them any lawful basis to be here and we were 
able to remove them within a period o three weeks.

Â

Now the message I think to people smugglers which 
will get through in the next few months from the Fijian Province is 
that that will not work. It certainly worked in relation to Bay High 
and as the word seeps through I think it will work in relation to Fijian. 
But in relation to Somali there have been attempts from there for people 
to come in relatively small numbers. People smuggling has occurred largely 
through use of false documentation, largely through air. I have outlined 
to you the two previous attempts by sea and I have outlined to you what 
has happened in this instance. I think it will be a very salutary lesson 
to those that have been involved in trying to promote this sort of venture.

Â

Question:

Â

Boat of 180 people - were they on their way to Australia?

Â

Minister:

Â

That was in 1992 I believe and involved 180 people. 
Reports in Somalia was that their destination was Australia but their 
immediate destination was the Yemen and the vessel sank between Somali 
and the Yemen as I understand it.

Â

Question:

Â

How was intelligence gathered?

Â

Minister:

Â

We have some information of an intelligence character 
which I think it’s important that we maintain confidential but obviously 
in relation to this matter we have engaged a number of interlocutors, 
people in various international organisations with whom we work particularly 
the UN organisations and they have confirmed a great deal of the information 
that was bought to our notice and certainly we had first hand information 
from contact that we made without identifying that it was Australia 
that was in touch with them that quite deliberate and misleading statements 
were being made to people about their entitlement to enter Australia.

Â

Question:

Â

Would you describe it as a professional operation?

Â

Ruddock:

Â

I would describe it as an operation involving a lot 
of money. People who have a considerable wealth who were intent upon 
an illicit purpose and exploiting a number of very vulnerable people. 
You don’t have a vessel of that size available for this purpose without 
a great deal of money being involved.

Â

Question:

Â

What can you do with local authorities to stop this 
sort of practice occurring?

Â

Minister:

Â

The only pressure that we can put given that such 
Governance that occurs in Somalia occurs largely on a regional basis 
the arrangements that we have brought to bear in this case and which 
I think have been successful is knowledge. Knowledge to in order to 
get to Australia you don’t embark on a hazardous voyage that can put 
your life at risk., that the people that are holding out that they have 
some authority to bring you are misleading you and that if you are paying 
money, and it’s a lot of money in a country like Somalia, in expectation 
that you obtain a lawful basis for entering Australia it is important 
that people know that that is not possible.

Â

Question:

Â

Officially we can’t do much then?

Â

Minister:

Â

No. Officially, we have taken steps which have had 
a very very significant impact in relation to these plans. The fact 
is they have been very very severely disrupted, if not thwarted. They 
are the words I have used very deliberately, we will see how matters 
go. Obviously this is a very important and significant development and 
one which I will be giving very serious consideration to a range further 
steps which need to be taken both legislatively as well as administratively 
to deal with the issues.

Â

Let me say that in my judgement the only way in which 
you deal with these issues is to be able to ensure that where people 
come they are not able to use a system which allows people to remain 
in Australia over a long period of time. That can be misused by people 
who are intent on another purpose. It urgently needs to be addressed. 
Secondly, you can not run-down, as we saw occur under the previous Government 
the system of compliance, the system of apprehension of people who are 
unlawful to the point where people believe that there is little prospect 
of them being caught once they are here. One of the very important steps 
that this Government has taken has been the enhancement of the compliance 
regime where we now have locations running at something like 13,000 
per year, almost double what they were previously, and something of 
the order of 20 per cent of the total number of people who are estimated 
to be in Australia unlawfully.

Â

Question:

Â

Why has Australia suddenly become such a target?

Â

Minister:

Â

What you find is that the framework of law that is 
operating, particularly in Europe and the United States of America has 
been the subject of considerable review and tightening, quite contrary 
to some of the observations that have been made in recent times about 
some leniency being taken in regards to particular people in China for 
instance in the USA. Their position is that they routinely ensure that 
people do not land in America where claims can be made and by essentially 
requiring people when they meet landfall to go to a country where international 
obligations are not engaged they effect very prompt and quick return 
to China.

Â

In the case of the United Kingdom, if you look at 
some of the cases, and I don’t intend to detail those today, but if 
you look at some of the cases under which the UK High court has been 
interpreting the Refugee Convention and compare it to decisions that 
have been taken by our courts looking at the same issue you find that 
their regime is much more rigorous that ours.

Â

Question:

Â

Their courts are tougher than ours?

Â

Minister:

Â

Their courts give I think, in precedential terms because 
you are talking about the highest courts in the land, they give a very 
different view of the refugee convention to that which some the judges 
in Australia have come to.

Â

Question:

Â

Why has it taken so long for our officials in Beijing 
to get to Fijian Province and get this message out?

Â

Minister:

Â

The Fijian endeavour has involved me, as well as officials, 
and me working with some of the Chinese press, that is the Chinese language 
press from China on these issues and I’ve been bringing to their notice 
our legal regime and the outcomes and they are in the process of being 
reported widely in China. We have the utmost cooperation from the Chinese 
Government. I met almost a month ago now with the Chinese Foreign Minister 
where they gave a continuing assurance to be vigilant in relation to 
clandestine departures but they have a very long coastline as we do. 
They gave assurances about accepting back those people that have no 
bona fide claims from Australia promptly and quickly and they have demonstrated 
that from the two accounts that I gave to you earlier. Officials from 
my department will be in Fijian Province this week, again ensuring that 
we are involved with Chinese not only at a national level but also at 
a provincial level.

Â

Question:

Â

In the Somali matter, who was shooting at who?

Â

Minister:

Â

I only have advice that shots were fired at the ship. 
Now if you are asking me if I knew who they were I don’t. One could 
surmise that it could be, law enforcement may well be a fairly generous 
term in relation to Mogadishu, but you could surmise that it were those 
who were involved in the administration of the particular area. It could 
be those who were disappointed at the fact that they had been mislead 
and were endeavouring to identify the people who were involved in the 
organisation.

Â

Question:

Â

The passengers themselves?

Â

Minister:

Â

Could well be.

Â

Question:

Â

Inaudible about ship?

Â

Minister:

Â

I don’t know that I can speak to you at length about 
the ship. I understand there are certain Somali interests that own it 
and they are not without resources and they are not without some power 
in the Somali administrative arrangements.

Â

Question:

Â

Are they untouchable?

Â

Minister:

Â

I don’t know I and would not purport to comment. issues in relation 
0 Somalia and where power lies are somewhat confusing but the people 
involved in this are not without influence .

Â

Question:

Â

Inaudible regarding broadcast.

Â

Minister:

Â

There was broadcast on the BBC and there was broadcast 
I understand on other local media and there was publication in newspapers 
and I think the French have also been bringing to notice the information 
that we have made know.

Â

Question:

Â

When was that?

Â

Minister:

Â

During the course of yesterday.

Â

Question:

Â

Other areas you are keeping an eye on?

Â

Minister:

Â

The fact is there have been a number of arrivals over 
time through Indonesia involving people who travel to Indonesia and 
engage Indonesian fisherman to bring them to the West Coast of Australia 
now that practice has occurred over a period of time and we have sought 
to deal with it in a number of ways. Firstly by prosecuting in Australia 
the Indonesian fisherman that we apprehend and quite significant penalties 
have already been imposed and we are strengthening these penalties in 
legislation that will be introduced shortly. We have in addition engaged 
Indonesian officials to see if we can have them detain people in Indonesia 
before they seek to depart. At various times they have been able to 
do that.
