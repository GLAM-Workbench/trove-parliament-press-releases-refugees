Media Release: Labor's first steps on a compassionate approach to refugees  November 8, 2016

Labor's crawl towards a more compassionate approach to refugees does not change their continued  support for cruel and ineffective policies, Greens Spokesperson for Immigration Nick McKim says.

"These are baby steps only, and Australia needs this to be the beginning of a more compassionate and  humane approach to people seeking Australia's protection," Senator McKim said.

"It’s time for Labor to add some vertebrae to their newly formed spine and reject offshore detention  and boat turnbacks."

"The old parties’ consensus on offshore detention and boat turnbacks has created a humanitarian  disaster."

"There are still people languishing in offshore detention on Manus Island and Nauru because of Labor-  Liberal cruelty."
