TRANSCRIPT OF DEPARTURE STATEMENTS BY PRIME MINISTERS HAWKE  AND THATCHER, 10 DONNING STREET, LONDON, 21 JUNE 1989

B 6 ÃÂ E - PROOF ONLY

HAWKE: Mrs Thatcher has invited me to make the initial comments. The first thing I say is to express to Mrs  Thatcher the appreciation of the Australian Government for  the catalytic role which she's taken to put a new vigour

into the Australian/United Kingdom relationship. I think it  commenced with a visit to Australia last year and upon her  return she has ensured that the preparations for our visit  have left nothing at all to be desired. We are now

participating in an historic meeting by which I mean that  never before has there been a delegation at a level of Prime  Minister and so many Ministers, reciprocated on you side.  That of course will be followed up tomorrow by the meeting  of more than 300 high level businessmen from my country and

from the United Kingdom, so we are engaged at this time in  as I say an historic enterprise to increase the level of  economic and trading relationship between our two countries  but it would be a misapprehension if it were to be taken

that it is merely bilateral matters with which we are  concerend. As important as they are, the United Kingdom and  Australia share common perceptions on matters of

international and regional importance. I think it's fair to  say Margaret, that tragically at this time an issue which  has taken up a fair bit of the discussion between yourself  and myself and between our Ministers is what has been  happening in China. We are at one in expressing a sense of

almost immeasurable tragedy as to what has happened there  and what has been further compounded by the most recent  evidence now of the execution of the Chinese who were

involved in the train incident in Shanghai. We both deplore  the decision of the Chinese authorities in taking that sort  of action which is out of all sort of relevance to what

those people were involved in. So we have talked about the  issue of China. We've talked about regional issues. We've  talked together about the challenges that confront us in a  world now where Europe is moving closer together after 1992,

where in our part of the world the region Is developing at  an enormously rapid rate offering for us and British

2.

(HAWKE cont): companies who come to operate out of Australia, enormous opportunities. We are also living in a  time where the changes within the Soviet Union led by  President Gorbachev are also presenting their own  opportunities and challenges and I think that Mrs Thatcher  and I share a fundamental perception about those  developments. That is that we welcome them. We believe  that is it appropriate that the West should, with caution,

assist in those changes that are happening but, as I say,  that that should be done with an appropriate sense of  caution. So you can see that I think we have covered a wide  range of subjects and our discussions will continue now over  what I think will be a useful working lunch Margaret. But I  conclude as I began by expressing my appreciation to you and  your Government for the thought and the preparation that has  gone into this meeting, which I believe can properly be

described as historic.

THATCHER: Just a few words because Mr Hawke has said almost  everything that there is to say about this. We give him a  very warm welcome to the united Kingdom. The invitation was  extended when 1 was over there for the bicentennial last  year, when I think we all realised that we were entering on

a new era of contacts. We must have more consultation about  global matters and much more consultation between Ministers  so that we may work for better on things like defence  matters, on things like trading matters, on things which

affect the whole world. Australia's position is very  prominent and the very thing about talking to her and her  Ministers is that our approach is the same. It starts on  human rights, the desire to extend those the world over and

as we now have great problems to face in the Pacific and  things happening which we never thought to see, it is very  good that we and Australia should have the time to talk  about those and other matters that Australia's very keen on,

such as the environment. I may say it is very easy to talk  with Australia, with all her Ministers, because of this  similarity of approach which is not just a one off meeting,  it is the beginning of a course of meetings which we'll

pursue regularly. There is a special one tomorrow between  trading ministers. While we have a conference at the Queen  Elisabeth Conference Centre to enhance the trading contacts

and to enhance investment both ways. We have long been high  investors in the United States. The United States is also a  very high investor in Britain, which we welcome. There has  been a very, very successful start and I'm sure that that  atmosophere will continue through the rest of the visit.

Thank you.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister can I ask you what your reaction is to the first reported executions of people involved in  the unrest in China?

3.

THATCHER: Utterley appalled. Just exactly as Bob Hawke pointed out, the punishment is totally out of proportion to  the crime and we are calling on them not to persecute those  who are merely trying to have better arrangements for

democracy. It just shows you that the depth of what has  happened in China is something which we hoped would never  happen and which we still can#t quite believe has to the  extent that they are repressing anyone who merely wants to

enlarge human relations. ~-

JOURNALIST: Did you make any progress on reassurances you  might offer the Hong Kong people?

THATCHER: we obviously talked about the Hong Kong people because we both feel the same way and understand how they  must be feeling. We cannot go any further than that at the  moment. We also have a very avid difficulty in Hong Kong  which we are working together on the Vietnamese boat people

and Australia has been really very, very help about that.  Australia has also had a considerable number of people from  Hong Kong, particularly those involved in industry and  taking up residence in Australia, which has been of great

comfort to the Hong Kong people and I think also of big  benefit to Australia.

JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke what about Hong Kong. What do you  think should be done about desires to have the right to come  out of the country if things get worse?

HAWKE: Obviously as far as this is directly a matter for decision by the United Kingdom as to the request by those  people to exercise what they may perceive as their right to  come here, that is a matter for decision and judgement by

Mrs Thatcher and her Government. All that we are concerned  to say is these things. First, that we express our  understanding of the pressures, the problems that confront

the United Kingdom in a situation where they had properly  thought that through detailed, unremitting negotiation with  the Chinese authorities that a position of being reached in  which you could have, confidence for the future of the people  of Hong Kong. Well that basis of confidence has gone after

the 4th of June and what has transpired since then. Now  I've said to Margaret that we will do what ever we can in  the approach together that we will adopt towards china to  try and create the basic improvement that is necessary. That is to try and create a situation whereby the time we  get up towards '97 there can be a much sounder ground for

saying to the people of Hong Kong, have confidence in the  future. That's what constructively must be the basic  approach. But in the meantime we have indicated for  instance in this financial year which is just concluding,  we've doubled our intake of people from Hong Kong. We will

look sympathetically at any approach on this matter in terms

4.

HAWKE (cont): of that other aspect of the question that Margaret has referred to, that is the Vietnamese refugees.   our assessment is identical. There shouldn't be any doubt  about this because there are amongst our friends a

reluctance to understand the realities. The realities are  these, that the people that are flooding into Hong Kong now  from Vietnam are not political refugees, they are economic

refugees. And as that is the case, then a different  approach is required and ye are at one on that and I believe  that as a result of the approach that we are adopting in  consultation with others, and including what's happened in  Geneva recently, we can have a more appropriate response to  what is an unacceptable influx of these people into Hong  Kong.

JOURNALIST: I just wanted to ask Prime Minister, whether  you've both thought about how you ought to be reacting to  china now, given that the united States are taking some  measures?

THATCHER: we have in fact spent I think about an hour  talking about that subject alone because it is so important  and of course we also keep very closely in touch with the  United States.

HAWKE: May I just add to that. It's not as though it is  just the United states that's taken decisions. The  Government of Mrs Thatcher has already taken decisions in  the area of supply of arms and so on, they've taken  decisions, so have we. It's not a question of the United

States being in front. If anything they are catching up  with us.

JOURNALIST: ... on the environment. Did you discuss Antarctica and what is your attitude now in light of the  agreement between the French Government and the Australian  Government to oppose mining there?

THATCHER: We both have the same objective in Antarctica.  It is a very important environmental area. There ... of  different. France did of course build a very considerable  air strip there compared to ... recently which is not

necessarily the best thing to do.

JOURNALIST: Can I take this opportunity about why you did so badly in the European elections?

THATCHER: Because ... insuff ienct of our supporters came out. The time when we did best in the European elections  was in 1979 when a far bigger proportion of those supporters

came out. Just exactly what I said to you the day before it  happened, it's an organisational election, it depends on  which side can get most of their supporters out. That's an  absolutely correct judgement-

5.

JOURNALIST: Did you get it wrong ...

THATCHER: The message we had was the bigger proportion of  our people were intending to come out but it did not turn  out to be the truth on a very hot, nice warm day.

JOURNALIST: Did you yourself get it wrong over Europe, do you think? .

THATCHER: No, no. Not at all.

HAWKE: You ought to try the Australian system Margaret. We make them vote, it's compulsory.
