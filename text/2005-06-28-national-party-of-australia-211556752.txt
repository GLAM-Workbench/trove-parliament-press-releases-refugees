RECOGNITION FOR CATHERINE OKERENYANG’S SUCCESSFUL  ASSIMILATION INTO LIFE IN WAGGA WAGGA



The Nationals Member for Riverina, Kay Hull, today congratulated Catherine  Okerenyang, a Ugandan refugee now living in Wagga Wagga on having her story  recorded in the booklet entitled “Refugee and Humanitarian Issues - Australia’s  Response.

“Catherine’s is a wonderful story of a successful assimilation into life in Australia  following her escape from Soroti in Uganda in 1987 when rebel forces took over the area  where her family lived,” Mrs Hull said.

Living in constant fear for their lives, Catherine’s family fled Uganda into Kenya where  they stayed in a refugee camp for eighteen months before being assessed as refugees by  UNHCR.  Catherine started a design and hairdressing course in Kenya before successfully  applying to resettle in Australia.

In 1991 Catherine’s family came to live in Wagga Wagga where they were the only  African family.  Catherine completed her High School Certificate at TAFE and an  Advanced Certificate in Fashion.  Today Catherine runs her own African store in Wagga  Wagga and lives a very busy life with her husband and two young boys.

Catherine says that she happily calls Wagga Wagga home and just loves her life in  Australia.  “Thanks to the refugee program, my children will never fear for their lives as  we did back in Uganda,” said Catherine.

“I find Catherine’s story quite inspirational and I congratulate her on overcoming the  difficulties of settling into another country and on adapting so successfully to a new way  of life in Wagga Wagga,” said Mrs Hull.
