Vol. 1 Those of you in New South Wales would not have heard much

No. 3 from this office by way of the Sydney Press. The Sydney Morning

June 1980 Herald seems to have lost interest in serious issues in Ethnic

Affairs. Even the Minister doesn't seem to get much in the way  K E E P I N G  YOU I N F O R M E D  of copy in the Herald! But never mind, other ways of keeping you informed will be found.  This newsletter is one way. In future, Media Statements will

be sent to more of you though it is time andresource consuming.

.  Also available, as a result of discussion -(see next item) is a

number of discussion/green papers on topics of interest to the  ethnic communities. Here is a list:

- "A Discussion Paper on Consumerism and Consumers from  a Non-English Speaking Background".

Only a limited number of these papers are still available - . they have been distributed to the press in most cases - so  please ask for a copy only if you have a specific use for it.

Finally, please let me know your "favourite neglected topic1 '  so  that I am forced to do something about it - and please let  me have constructive criticisms and suggestions for inclusion  in future newsletters.

Immediately after the 1977 elections, discussions were initiated  with ethnic groups and workers in the ethnic communities, in  ALP ethnic advisory committees in most States and at meetings  of Labor Ministers and Shadow Ministers for Immigration and

Ethnic Affairs. These discussions resulted in a redrafted ALP  policy on Immigration and Ethnic Affairs which was submitted  to,and with minor modifications, accepted by the ALP,Federal

Conference in Adelaide 1979.

This was further improved and expanded and after final consideration  by Caucus,  the ALP policy on Immigration and Ethnic Affairs for  the 1980 elections was formulated.

The Policy is due for release on Monday 23 June 1980.

In the financial year 19 79/80 , Australia will take 21,000  refugees. They are from the following regions/countries:

Indo-Chinese 15,000

East Europeans (mainly Poland and.Czechoslovakia) 3,000

Jews from U.S.S.R. (Special non-refugee programme) 1,500

Timorese (non-refugees) 500

All other countries (incl. 200 Cubans) 1,000

A Departmental "Working Party" is presently in Europe processing  the European refugees (and Jews in Austria). It’s also worth  noting that - as the Department puts it - "because of staff  shortages" European refugees are not included in the general

refugee category. Only the "Indo-Chinese" are considered to be  refugees in tabulations by "source regions" by the Department of  Immigration. Is this a nostalgic note for the "good old" policies  ("White Australia" and all that?) ... It seems that refugees are  being used not only as factory 1  fodder* but also as a statistical

"gap filler" to replenish the deficiencies of the Government's  immigration policy. .

A new group, the "High Court of Australia Fan Club", (from  Melbourne) has recently published a leaflet in Canberra. According  to the leaflet, the cost of the May 26 1980 official opening of the High Court by the Queen has exceeded $1 million. This.

amount included (they say):

3.

* $400,000 to pay for a plane to transport the Queen from  England to Australia and backÂ·

* $40,000 for new uniforms for Commonwealth car drivers;

* $12,000 for commemorative medallions.

"It is also necessary",the leaflet points out, "that this $1 million  be compared to the $175,000 provided annually by the Federal  Government for all of Australia's community legal centres."

According to the A.B.S. figures published on 21 May 1980, the  unemployment rate (%) in April 1980 among overseas b o m  were  as follows;

Male Female Persons

B o m  in Australia 4.8% 2.9% 6.0%

B o m  outside Australia .  5.3% 9.6% 6.4%

Arrived before 1971 4.2% 7.2% 5.0%

1971 to 1978 6.7% 11.8% 8.4%

1979 to survey date 20.4% 30.0% 23.9%

According to the Minister for Transport, Qantas has indicated  that there are no accurate figures available on how many  incidents are related to alcohol abuse. In the 12 months to  the end of March 1980, Qantas cabin crews reported 127 incidents  related to the handling of "difficult" passengers on board flights.  The Minister assures us that "Qantas does also have some,

strategies to minimise the reported abuse to passengers and crew".

The British Government has published a White Paper containing 1   Government proposals for revised immigration rules.  The new  rules, which, became effective in February 1980, reflect the  British Government ' s desire to tighten entry provisions to the  United Kingdom.

The main changes embodied in the new rules are:

(a) People who are admitted for temporary purposes such as visitors,  students and working holidaymakers, will not be eligible to remain for another, temporary, purpose if this carries with  it the purpose of eventual settlement.

(b) Husbands and fiancees of women who are U.K. citizens but  who were not b o m  in the U.K. will no longer qualify for  admission to the U.K. for settlement with their wives or  fiancees.

(c) Age limits for working holidaymakers will be reduced from  30 to 25 years and the period of stay reduced from five to  two years.

The British authorities have stated that the working holidaymakers  scheme as it will now be applied will still be broadly comparable  to the reciprocal Australian working holiday rules.

Some sections of the media frequently complain that we are overÂ­ taxed; that this overtaxing supports over-expenditure on social  security and that the welfare system is exploited by vast  numbers of 'bludgers'.  Reference to OECD figures on taxation

as a percentage of GDP puts the Australian position into persÂ­ pective. This table shows total taxes as a percentage of GDP  in 1977: .

4 .

Sweden 53.4

Norway 47.5

Netherlands 46.3

Denmark 42.0

France 39.6

Germany 38.1

Italy 37.6

Britain 36.6

Ireland 35.2

New Zealand 34.5

Canada 32.0

Switzerland 31.5

U.S.A. 30.3

Australia 30.0

More highly taxed countries have performed better in the present  economic crisis than we have, in coping with inflation, and  unemployment. Furthermore, our expenditure on welfare is not  high when compared with other OECD countries.,

This might be the reason why many immigrants find our social security  system quite inadequate compared to their countries of origin.

There are some 9,850 German social security beneficiaries  now living in Australia. They include Jews, (compensation  payments), war pensioners, age pensioners, etc. It is estimated  that in 1979, the sum of $29,550,000 was paid in various benefits

to ex^German residents now living in Australia. In pensions  alone it is estimated that $19,800,000 was paid by the German  Federal Republic to Australian residents.

By comparison, at .31 March 1979, under the portability provisions,  Australia was paying 279 pensions in the German Federal Republic  this is equivalent to $697,500.

Temporary entrants to Australia of all categories including  visitors, people admitted for periods of temporary residence and  illegal entrants, such as ships' deserters, who applied for or  were granted change to resident status in 1977*78 and 1978-79

totalled:

Year Applications Lodged Applications approved*

1977- 78 14,000(est) 12,000(est)

1978- 79 5,903 6,024

*The number of applications approved includes some lodgements  from previous years.

1. 1977-78 figures are not known precisely due to deficiencies  in the statistical reporting system.

Within the 1978-79 totals, 2,863 applications and 2,732 approvals  were for applicants who came to Australia with visitor visas.

The current cost of production of From the Ethnic Press

including purchase of ethnic newspapers, translated summaries  of selected items, printing and distribution and direct labour  costs, is about $1,300 per week or $1 per copy.

That adds up to $67,600 a year..

The cost of production of For the Ethnic Media,, including  printing distribution and direct labour costs, is about $500 per  week or 52c per copy.

Do you really think it's worth $25,000 a year?

The Australian assets of "Life" and "General Insurance" companies  operating in Australia are in excess of $19 billion.

The Tertiary Education Commission has estimated that the average  cost of training a teacher is approximately $13,000 at December  1979 cost levels.

The total number of unemployment benefits terminated in 1978-79  for Australia are estimated at 785,000. In New South Wales alone  there were 244,000 benefits terminated.

*The time taken.to deal with an application for citizenship fromÂ·  the date of lodgement until the date of decision according to  recent information,averages three (3) months. .

*The February 1980 "Quarterly Survey of Unemployment Benefit  Recipients" published by the Department of Social Security  indicate that 21.8% of all beneficiaries were b o m  overseas. Of  those, 7.8% (24,900) were b o m  in the U,K. and the remaining 14%

(44,600) in other countries.

* The Government has approved the provision of'  a total of $295,000  in the financial year 1979/80 for the purchase of special"free-  issue"items.  These include the Australian National Flag, cassette  recordings of "God Save the Queen" and "Advance Australia Fair"  and coloured photographas of Her Majesty the Queen.

As the table below indicates, there has been a considerable  decrease in the number of both Government and private dwellings  constructions commenced in 1978/79, compared to 1975/76.

In the "Hansard" of 20 May 1980, there is a reply by Mr Peacock  to a question asked by Mr Hodgman regarding the "Moscow Olympic  Games11 Â· .  Here is a reproduction of the question and reply:

Moscow Olympic Games  Question No. 6062. Mr Hodgman asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice,  on 30 April 1980:

Has the Government formulated contingency plans for the release  and repatriation of Australian competitors who may be taken  hostage by the Soviet authorities should the Australial Olympic  Federation determine to send a team to the 1980 Moscow Olympic  Games in defiance of the express wishes of the Government; if so,

(a) what powers does the Government possess to enforce its plans  and (b) is there any guarantee that the Government coild force  the U.S.S.R. to set free competitors who may be forcibly detained?

Mr Peacock - The answer to the honourable member's question is  as follows:

The Government has not formulated any such contingency plans. It  considers the contingency raised as remote in the extreme.

On the same page, the Minister for Defence assures us that  "H.M.A.S, Melbourne" will be stationed on a temporary basis (for  3 monhts), in the Indian Ocean.

The maximum T.E.A.S. allowance in 1980 is $2,348 (per annum). This is payable in the case of a married person where the income  of the spouse did not exceed $9,400 in the 1978-79 financial  year.

The minimum T.E.A.S. allowance is $300 per annum, which is payable  to a married person if the spouse’s income is $13,497. '  Â·  t - Ã¢ÂÂ

In 1976 the Committee on the Teaching of Migrant Languages in  Schools estimated that there were approximately 600 "Saturday"  and "Sunday" schools (part-time ethnic schools) in Australia.  There has been no nation-wide survey conducted since but all

the indications are that the number of such schools has increased  markedly (especially among the Greek and Italian communities).   Currently they would number about 1,000.

These schools presently do not receive any direct financial ;   assistance from the Federal Government. Â·

On 7th February 1980, allied war veterans ;became eligible for  a service pension, provided they satisfy the following  requirements: (a) served as member of a formally raised force;

(b) served in a theatre of war; "

(c) resided in Australia for at least 10 years; (d) satisfies income test requirements; and , (e) has reached 60 years of age if a male and 55 years of age if a female. .

To 30 April 1980, 639 applications were received. Of those, 401  were approved and 61 refused. The break down of the approved  pensions by country is as follows: .

The average payment per month Is 118,000 Italian lire  (Aust.  $118) over a period of 13 months, (in Italy, there is a  so-called "tredicesima” scheme under which a one-month - thirteenth  month —"bonus" payment is made). Therefore the amount paid by

the Italian Government to persons residing in Australia is  approximately Aus. $13,950,196. .  .

Under the "portability provisions" there are 2,335 persons eligible  for Australian pensions living in Italy. At a rate of  approximately $2,500 per annum, that means that a total of  $5.Smillion was paid by the Australian Government in Italy (to  the 31 March 1989). -

Can you understand it? If you don't you are not alone. Survey  after survey has shown that Australians are utterly confused  about the health insurance system. With all likelihood not  even the Minister knows that "ins-and-outs" of it. Advertisements  by Government and private agencies have no doubt contributed  to the general confusion. .

Just for the record, the following sums have been spent by the  Federal Government in order to advertise the changes from a  perfectly "healthy" medibank to a "Tower of Babel" health ,   insurance scheme.
