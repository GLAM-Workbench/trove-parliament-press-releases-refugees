25TH ANNIVERSARY OF UNITED NATIONS ASSISTANCE MISSION IN

RWANDA



A national service to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the United Nations

Assistance Mission in Rwanda will be held at the Australian Peacekeeping

Memorial on Anzac Parade in Canberra today.



Shadow Minister for Veterans’ Affairs and Defence Personnel Shayne

Neumann paid tribute to Australia’s Rwandan peacekeeping veterans from

Operation TAMAR.



“Following inter-ethnic violence in Rwanda in 1994,Australia heeded a UN call

to contribute personnel to a peacekeeping deployment, sending two

contingents of medical and support units to Rwanda in August that year,” he

said.



“Australian peacekeepers worked in the Rwandan capital Kigali and travelled

throughout the country, providing medical help to civilians, including those in

internment and refugee camps. Australian personnel remained in Rwanda until

August 1995.





Members of both contingents were confronted with scenes of unimaginable

horror and brutality, the like of which few other Australian peacekeepers had

experienced,” Mr Neumann said.



Mr Neumann said it was important to acknowledge all Australians

peacekeepers who deployed to Rwanda on Operation TAMAR.



“Today I attended a national commemorative service at the Australian

Peacekeeping Memorial on Anzac Parade in Canberra, where I represented

Labor Leader Anthony Albanese and laid a wreath to honour those who

served.



“The ceremony was an opportunity to recognise the service of those involved in

support of the UN’s peacekeeping efforts and thank them for their service,” Mr

Neumann said.
