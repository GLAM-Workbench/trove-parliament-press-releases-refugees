L A B O R 'S HEALTH PLAN .

The details of Labor's health policy were released by Bill Hayden  and Neal Blewett on 4 February 1982. .  .

The principles are simple and very close to the original Medibank  scheme proposed by the Labor Government in 1973.

Main.features

There will.be a 0.75% levy on taxable income above $5,720 a year  for a single person and above $9,000 a.year for a family (plus  $1,040 for each dependant). .

This will pay for: '  Ã¢ÂÂ   .  .

.  a return to free treatment in public hospitals;

.85% of all medical and optometrical bills,  with a maximum of  Ã¢ÂÂ¢  $10 a service. If a patient attends a doctor who, bulk-bills  there will be' no charge. If a patient attends a doctor who  does not bulk-bill, that patient can claim 85% of the bill,

directly from the Government; .  ,  .

.  increased funds for community health, and no charges for  medical services at community health centres;

.  free pharmaceutical benefits for those on unemployment or  special benefit, as an extension of the present pensioner  scheme; .  .  .  .  .  .

.  .  reduced rate of pharmaceutical costs for some patients with chronic illnesses or specified disabilities. .  :  ,

Main changes

Private fund medical insurance will, be abolished.  .  It will no  longer be necessary because payment of doctors' bills will be  made either directly by the Government to doctors (bulk-billing)  or through the Government fund. Private insurance funds can

still offer insurance for ancillary services, such.as physiotherapy,  dental treatment and chiropractic.

Hospital insurance for treatment in public hospitals will no .   longer be necessary because that treatment will once again be  free of means test. It will also free public hospitals of the  need to hire debt collectors:to.chase unpaid bills.

Private hospital insurance will be available for. people who want  to ensure treatment in private hospitals or from their own  doctors in the private wards of public hospitals. This will be .   cheaper than at present because we will give greater subsidies

to private hospitals to keep insurance rates down. .

The tax rebate on private health insurance, will be scrapped,, with  that money going directly to the States for public hospitals and  to directly reduce the price of private hospital insurance. ,  .

2. .

Pensioners, beneficiaries and low income earners

No pensioner with a health card or low income person or family  with a disadvantaged card will pay the 0.75% levy.

All pensioners.and beneficiaries in our scheme will have the  same right to care, as all other Australians.

They will no longer have to prove *  1  poverty1  to get free health  care. They will be patients, not 1disadvantaged people1.  There  will be no stigma and no first- and second-class services.

If some pensioners and low income people wish to pay for  private hospital insurance, they may, and it will cost them  less than at present. ,  But this should not be necessary when .   public hospitals again receive sufficient funding to operate  without charge.. .  .  :  .  .  .

It is expected that pensioners, beneficiaries and chronically  ill patients will, be bulk-billed and will not have to handle  patient accounts. .  .  \

The expensive system of processing and mailing 10 million  1  disadvantaged1  cards will stop. .  .

Payment changes

The 0.75% levy on taxable income has been set at a level, above  the current means test for pensioners and people classified as 1  disadvantaged1, so those people will pay nothing.

The levy cuts in when a single person's income is $5,720 a year and a family's is $9,000 a year,  that sum rising by $1,040 for each dependant.  These lower limits, will be indexed annually

Even at the highest income levels no one person of family will  have to pay more than $449. a year health levy, and. this ceiling  will also be indexed annually. In families where more than: one  adult is working, each will pay 0.75% of their annual income

up to the $449 a year level. .  .

This will be taken automatically as is taxation, eliminating,  the need for time-wasting payments at health fund offices.

Dependent students and overseas students in Australia for over  six months will be covered without, payments. ..

Nine out of ten Australians, will be better off if they have  just health levy cover (free hospital and 85% medical).

Three out of four Australians will be better off even after  taking private hospital insurance. For example -.  a family whose income is below $173 a week at present .

would have' a health card, no health insurance, and .  . ‘  therefore receive no rebate.  They will be below the .  .   levy starting point, so. will pay nothing. . '  No change.  .

.  a family whose income is $200 a week (just outside the . pensioner fringe benefit and 'disadvantaged1.level) . .  now average $10 a week private insurance.  Under our  scheme they will pay only $1.50 levy a week (plus

$3.00 private insurance if required)..

'3.

.  a family whose income is $300 a week now average $10 a week  . .  private insurance. Under our scheme they will pay only  $2.25 levy a week (plus $3.00 private insurance if required)

.  a family whose income is $500 a week now paying $10 a week  private insurance will pay only $3.75 levy a week (plus  $3.00 private insurance) .  .  ;

.  a family whose income is $900 a week pays $6.75 a week  levy plus $3.00 private insurance. Above that level  the few families on $1,000 or more a week will pay the  maximum of $8.63 levy plus $3 private insurance.

Health cost changes .  .  .  :  Â·

The cost to Government: of our new proposals will, be no greater  than the. present Liberal scheme,.although under Labor the  funding willÂ· be more equitable and the service universal.

Funds will come from .  .  .

.  the 0.75% levy on taxable income $590m .

.  redirecting tax rebate on health insurance $660m

.  reducing the Commonwealth subsidy to the .

reinsurance pool .  $80m

$1,330m

Costs will b e .  - .  Â·  .  '

.  .  universal 85% benefit .  $710m

.  extra hospital funds to States. ... .  $520.m

.  increased subsidies to private hospitals , .  (another $30 a day bed day subsidy to private .  .

hospitals; and an expected $40 a day reduction  for private beds in public hospitals) Ã¢ÂÂ  '  '  $30m

.  immediate addition to. community health funding $20m

.. extension of pharmaceutical benefits .  .  $30m

.  additional administrative expenses $20m

$1,330m

General ‘  .  .  . .

Labor's scheme i s .simple, universal and carefully costed. People will pay according, to their incomes instead of the  present system where all except pensioners and those classified  as 'disadvantaged' pay the same private health fund rates  whether they are rich or poor. .  ...

Under the/current Liberal scheme it is estimated that well over  a million people have neither cards nor health insurance, and  therefore, no'protection against;chronic or catastrophic illness  If they miscalculate,, they are. in for crippling debt and the  horror of being chased by debt-collectors. Labor's scheme,

in covering everyone, ensures that families need not gamble  with their health. .  .

A universal health insurance scheme operated by a single fund  is less costly to administer than dozens of competing funds. It will also enable it to more easily identify fraudulent  claims and over-servicing of patients. .

We would also have an overhaul of the medical benefits  schedule in co-operation with the States and medical  profession. Cost containment would be assisted by the  development of hospital audits, accreditation and peer review.

Finally, all evidence shows that bulk-billing.is not only  cheaper to the patient, but costs the Government less. Costs  go up when private insurance increases. .

When 1  user pays' - thie Fraser philosophy - applies,  the 'user',  encouraged by the medical profession, uses more services. .  .

UNEMPLOYMENT PICTURE REMAINS GRIM

The latest statistics from Social Security show that on  22 January this year 351Â·, 425 people were receiving unemployment .   benefit, the highest January figure ever. There are .9.0% more.,  on unemployment benefit than there were when Malcolm Fraser  became Prime Minister, and the February figure is expected '

to be even higher. .  .  . Â· Â·

Though unemployment under this Government has seriously . worsened, that fact is regrettably receiving little public .  ,. attention. . Ã¢ÂÂ  Ã¢ÂÂ  Â· . Ã¢ÂÂ  . Ã¢ÂÂ  Ã¢ÂÂ   .

No Government has tried harder to reduce the unemployment rolls  (while doing little about unemployment). It has stopped the .   release of embarrassing C.E.S. figures, though it Still collects  them. It has cut out unemployment benefit to school;leavers,   taken people it classifies as ..voluntarily,  unemployed off payments'

for three months,  and found a dozen.other ways of harassing the  jobless. It has. increased its fraud squads and identity checks  - but the figures remain, high because unemployment in this. .  .   country is little short of catastrophic. Moreover,  these are .  .

real people, these 351,425 on benefit, not notional estimates  based on a restrictive survey. .: . Â· Â· .  :  .  .

In addition to those paid unemployment benefit, at. last count '   another 3,731 were receiving special benefit, as unemployed Â·   people, either because they were long-term unemployed, or were  outside the age limits. No doubt some of ..those would be.

receiving invalid pension if the Government had not made, those  rules so tough. .  '  .  Ã¢ÂÂ   .  Â·  .

Not only are there more people on unemployment benefit because  they can't get work, but they are on benefit for longer.

.  .  In 1975, 11.5% were on benefit for under 2 weeks, but  in 1981 that had fallen to. 3%. .  .  .  , .

.  In 1975, 19.3% of the unemployed had been on benefit for more than 6 months, but in 1981 that figure had more than .   doubled to 40.6%. .  .  Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ Â·.Â·Ã¢ÂÂ Â· ,

5.

.  Between 1975 and 19.81 the highest growth in the numbers on unemployment benefit has been in the 25-44 year range, . a group in the workforce which is normally experienced and  stable, but has been adversely affected by economic conditions.

Â·, Between 1975 and 1981 the number of men over 65 and women  Over 60 in the workforce declined by 42,000, representing  another group of the .  'hidden unemployed1.

.  Between February 1980 and February 1981 there were 127,700  people who had looked for work all year and found none. Only about 70,000 of them were on unemployment benefit for  the year.,  . . .  .

The Government's Report,on Poverty Measurement singles out .   lone parent families and unemployed families as particularly  disadvantaged. It said: .  .  .

Ã¢ÂÂ¢Of social security pensioners and beneficiaries, those  whose principal source of income is unemployment benefit . (the long-term unemployed) .are particularly likely to .  . have low.incomes in relation to need." (August 1981)

One way in which that need could be overcome would be to .

reduce the discrimination between pensioners and the unemployed .   by paying the latter rent assistance. .  .  .

At present unemployed and special beneficiaries are not  eligible for supplementary (rent) assistance paid to pensioners  and to sickness beneficiaries after six weeks on benefit. However, a survey in 19,79 showed that 75% of unemployment  beneficiaries paid rent. .  .

It is no longer possible to use the same slippery reasoning  that Senator Guilfoyle did .in 1979 when she said:

"Many unemployment beneficiaries receive ..unemployment.   benefit for only part of a year - for the remainder of .

the year they are in^receipt of normal wages which are  considerably higher than the rates of. pension or benefit," .

As we have seen above, 40.6% of. the unemployed, have been on benefit for more than six months. Around 77% have been on. benefit for more, than two months.  .  ;

Other changes to assist unemployed families should be .  . made in the next,Budget, for- example - .  .  Â·  .

.  raise permissible earnings in line with those for  pensioners (i.e., $20 a week with a $1 reduction for  every $2 income); .  .  .

.’  eliminate taxation on the spouse and children's . . .  allowances; '  .  .  .  .  :  .  .  .

.  give pharmaceutical benefits to the.unemployed.  .

Single pensioners, deserve recognition too as a group which  has. been shamefully disregarded - the under-18 because they  do. not .  vote, and the over-.18 because the Government believed  they could successfullyÂ· 'blame.the victim'. .

The Labor Party will support, all campaigns to obta,in  economic and social justice for the unemployed.  '  .

INFORMATION NOT GETTING TO THE RIGHT PEOPLE

The Report of the Task Force on Departmental Information has  unaccountably been kept from the public since the Government  received it in July 1980. .

Our particular interest, is in the ..terms of reference

'.requiring the Task Force to report and make recommendations  on particular areas of departmental information activities  including (a)(v) information for disadvantaged groups'. .

In discussing this reference the Report notes.that the Henderson  Poverty Commission..found that in 1973 some 17,000 poor households  entitled7  to social services were not receiving one whether  '  through ignorance or pride'.' It also found that .

'the language, length and format of many application forms  are such as to hamper severely the poorly educated potential  applicants' .  ' : Â·  .  ,  Ã¢ÂÂ   .

The Task Force states that socio-economic and. information  disadvantage usually go together, and have a mutually .   aggravating effect, on each other. .  .  .

As it is estimated that $40 million a year is spent on public  information services, with,444 public..servants engaged full-time  in churning it out, we should ask what the disadvantaged are  gaining from it. .  Â·. \ ^  Â·

To quote the Task ‘ Force Report: Ã¢ÂÂ   .

'Traditional government communication practices have tended  to reinforce disadvantage rather than overcome it;. Bureaucrats.usually write for. bureaucrats.. When journalists  are employed specifically to prevent this, they often find Â·

themselves... under, pressure to. write like bureaucrats.. . .  . The specific needs of disadvantaged groups are often :  .  .  . Â· overlooked.'  .  Ã¢ÂÂ   .  .

A survey of the government public relations staff gave their . views. ’.  '  '  '  '. -  '  Â·  ’  Â·  .  Ã¢ÂÂ

.Â· 56% said there was too much emphasis on print media;

.  69% said disadvantaged groups were more difficult to reach  .  than other groups in the community; .  .

.. 60% said there was too little use of radio in government  information activities; .

.  80% said they would reach people more effectively if TV  were used more in their information programs.

According to the 1978 South Gippsland Social Survey, a study  supported by the Department of Social Security, only somewhere . between 5% and 11% of respondents had obtained information  about social security from leaflets. .  ...

/

Moreover a readability study.of selected government publications  reported that '  .  .  ,

'it is.reasonable to assume that many within the target  audiences for Government information would find much of  the information incomprehensible'.

The Task Force Report states that, routine attitudes are either  not changing at all or are.changing sluggishly. It described  as an 'inadequate response'  the tendency, noted by Galbally, to  produce multilingual pamphlets by translating existing material

into selected ethnic languages * and to regard the task of  reaching migrant groups as thus accomplished.

So much for the description of the negative aspects of . .  government information. In attempting to approach the  problem more positively the Task Force states:

.  'It is difficult to see other than marginal improvements in communicating with disadvantaged.groups without . additional expenditure..

'Reaching, the disadvantaged effectively costs more than  . .  reaching the general public... ultimately more money would .   need to be spent on whichever supplementary devices were  .  found most desirable, such as increased media advertising,

interpreters', fees, audio-visual aids, liaison officers,  mobile display units,  or community based advice and  referral centres. '  .Â·..Ã¢ÂÂ Â· "  . .  '  .. .

These findings have been echoed by reports from the National  Women's Advisory Council (on disadvantaged women), the Survey  into the Information Needs of. Migrants, the House of Representatives  Report on Aboriginal Legal Aid, and the Report of the National  Consultative Council on Social Welfare, in recent years.- .

The Department of Social Security has ignored all of this. .

Its record under the Fraser Government proves how unwilling it  is to spend money to reach its disadvantaged; clients.. .  ,

In. 19 76 its publicity budget was $550,00:0. Five years later,  excluding.extra expenditure involved with the health care  card and I.Y.D.p., the publicity budget is $586,000, an .   effective cut of over 50%. . . .  .  . . . .

It has authorised no.paid radio or television advertising  because of what Senator Guilfoyle called the."substantial,  cost". .  in short, it has. shown complete contempt, for the  socio-economic and. information disadvantage of the people .  .

for whom it should be accepting responsibility.

The Task Force quoted a study which noted.- .  .

'Among government officials especially we detected a fear that, people would "take.  advantage" of the services, offered . if they were publicised "too widely". .  .

Senator Chaney would doubtless commend the timidity and .

callousness of.the approach of those officials. He has not . taken one action to appropriate additional funds to carry out  the extremely sensible and modest recommendations of the Task Force,. so that essential information gets to our. most disadvantaged people.
