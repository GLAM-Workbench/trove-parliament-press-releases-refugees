E&OE.........................................................................................................................................

Peter Van Onselen

As you can see when the Labor leadership isn’t circus dominating the headlines in Canberra it has been border protection  and national security; and to discuss that, Michael Keenan, the Shadow Minister, welcome to the program.

Michael Keenan

Nice to be here Peter.

Peter Van Onselen

Can I just ask you straight up, what would have been done differently had your side of politics been in power rather than  the Labor Party as far as this Egyptian terrorist goes?

Michael Keenan

There are a whole series of things. Firstly we wouldn’t have our security agencies under the enormous pressure that  they’re under at the moment to make assessments just about the sheer volume of illegal arrivals who are streaming into  Australia.

Peter Van Onselen

Why’s that?

Michael Keenan

Because we won’t have the situation where we are having 3,000 people arrive on illegal boats per month. Now ASIO are  doing a very difficult job trying to clear people but when your dealing with such an enormous volume of people then clearly  it is very very difficult for them to make a sensible assessment about the risks that any individual might pose to the  Australian community.

Secondly Peter, and very importantly, if we had a national security concern about someone who arrived here on an illegal  boat, you would not find them surrounded by a pool fence in the Adelaide Hills. You would find them within a maximum  security facility, which is certainly appropriate for someone who has been convicted of charges of this nature.

Peter Van Onselen

Can I ask you: As many months before the Government was even aware that this particular individual was being housed,  as you say, behind a pool fence, is there anything procedurally that you’ve got planned to ensure you as the relevant  Minister will know about this earlier than this Government and this particular Minister knew about it in this instance.

Michael Keenan

Absolutely, because what we found out this week is that the Gillard Government has a completely chaotic approach to  national security issues, and the Government was notified remember, it was notified by their own department in  September last year. Now a briefing went up to the Minister and we don’t even know what happened to that briefing. So  what has happened is just a whole series of failures here but the Government are the ones who must take responsibility  for that. The immigration department was notified by both ASIO and by the AFP that they had this very dangerous  individual behind a pool fence in the Adelaide Hills. And at every single time they were notified, nothing at all happened.  And that 100% goes to the heart of how the Gillard government deals with national security issues.

Paul Kelly

Given that we’ve got 3,000 people arriving a month at the moment, do you think it is possible and are you confident that  ASIO is doing proper security checks?

Michael Keenan

No I’m not because ASIO are an agency of about 1700 people, they apparently have hundred of people working on this  and it is incredibly difficult for them to do those assessments in a proper and thorough way. The director general of ASIO  practically admitted that to estimates when he all they can do at the moment is have a very, very light touch approach to  this. People are arriving here without documents; it’s very difficult to verify anyone’s identity let alone go back and look at  the history of the people who are coming here.

Peter Van Onselen

Can I ask you just on that though, because following from Paul Kelly’s editorial - if it is going to take the Coalition time to  stop the boats, then presumably this same problem of over work for ASIO is going to exist for quiet some time at least  even if you get done [the stopping of the boats] for the initial year or two of the Abbott Government before you can stem  that tide.

Michael Keenan

We are going to inherit enormous challenges, if we do get a chance to govern, from the Labor Party in this area. One  we’ve got to make sure ASIO are properly resourced to deal with it and two, we’ve obviously got to try and reduce their  work load and we’ll do that when we stop the boats. The Gillard Government incidentally actually cut the budget that ASIO  had to do these security checks unbelievably.

Peter Van Onselen

Will you reinstate that?

Michael Keenan

We will always prioritise frontline law and order services and frontline national security services. Certainly we will make  sure that ASIO are properly resourced to be able to do this job because it is vitally important that we have an  understanding about who it is that is arriving here and who might pose a national security risk.

Paul Kelly

What are your own views about that? I mean to what extent do you think that there are a number of people coming into  this country who are security risks?

Michael Keenan

13/09/2013 http://www.keenan.net.au/DesktopModules/DnnForge%20-%20NewsArticles/Print.as...

I think the vast majority of people don’t pose any threat to the Australian community, but when you’re dealing with  upwards of 43,000 people, then what is going to happen is that criminals will seek to take advantage of that weakness and  of course people that might seek to do Australia harm could also see this as a way of coming into the country. Now we  know about the case of the Egyptian terrorist and we also understand that there was a Sri Lankan accused of murder, he  was released into the community on a bridging visa. We know of the case of an accused Iranian drug smuggler, there are  55 people within the security network that ASIO think are security threats and these are only the cases that we know  about Paul, so clearly, when you’ve got such a volume of people the risks are that when you’ve got someone who might  seek to do Australia harm could come to Australia in this way.

Simon Benson

You’ve isolated this particular case and it does appear to be an isolated case so far, as much as we know, last week you  launched a three pronged attack on the Government, Accusations of Ministerial failure, an immigration failure and an  intelligence failure. Which is the most concerning to you?

Michael Keenan

Of most concern to me is the way the Gillard Government handles these national security issues. There has been a whole  series of failures but it is the Government that must take responsibility because they are the ones who are supposed to  provide this sort of leadership. We’ve had a whole series of incidents when the Government was notified but nothing  happened - they were actually notified about this individual by two separate agencies and of course the Minister at the  time was also notified and at no stage did they actually act to do anything.

Simon Benson

But does a Minister need to be notified of this at the first instance if ASIO are aware of this and the Department of  Immigration are aware of it, shouldn’t they be acting in the first instance to rectify it and then to go - I mean where does  the ministerial vetting of these things come into the process?

Michael Keenan

If someone arrives in Australia who has been convicted of murder and has been convicted of explosive offences, fire arms  offences, convicted of being a member of the Egyptian Islamic Jihad, which later merged with Al Qaeda, if were the  Minister I would like to be notified instantly.

Paul Kelly

Do you think we need to do more in terms of working with Indonesia on the question of border protection and in particular  the role of the Australian Federal Police in Indonesia? I think you’ve got concerns about that.

Michael Keenan

Working with Indonesia on this issue will be pivotal and astonishingly in the last budget the Gillard Government actually  cut the AFP presence in Jakarta by 40 per cent.

Peter Van Onselen

Will you re-instate that?

Michael Keenan

13/09/2013 http://www.keenan.net.au/DesktopModules/DnnForge%20-%20NewsArticles/Print.as...

We will always prioritise these sorts of services.

Peter Van Onselen

You said that to my last question about that. Lets be honest that’s rhetoric. If needed will you put the resources into this  because that’s a budget question, I mean obviously the Coalition wants to run on a tight fiscal policy but you are saying  that resources are being cut.

Michael Keenan

We will certainly prioritise these agencies Peter, I can give you that undertaking; and in terms of the AFP presence in  Jakarta, it is vitally important that we have office up there dealing with and liaising with their Indonesian counterparts; and I  might say that the AFP have been very successful in establishing a working relationship with their Indonesian counterparts  and to cut their presence their was an incredibly foolish decision.

Peter Van Onselen

Can you stop the boats without the cooperation of Indonesia or is that an absolute necessity?

Michael Keenan

I think we can stop the boat by destroying the pull factors from Australia, but we will certainly work to cooperate with the  Indonesians and that relationship will be pivotal. I think that we will establish a very good working relationship with them.

Peter Van Onselen

What about turning boats around? Is that something that can be achieved without the support of the ports from which you  intend to send them back to?

Michael Keenan

Australia can do that and in the past we have done that with the acquiescence of the Indonesians, but it wasn’t by a formal  arrangement. Remember when it comes to turning these boats back around it would be sending Indonesian flagged boats  with an Indonesian crew back to the Indonesian port from which they’ve left; and there’s absolutely nothing from stopping  that.

Peter Van Onselen

So you don’t need Indonesia for that very reason - that seems logical to me, you don’t need their cooperation you can just  turn them around because they are after all from Indonesia.

Michael Keenan

We don’t need a formal arrangement with the Indonesians to do that and when we have done that in the past we did not  have a formal arrangement in place.

Paul Kelly

13/09/2013 http://www.keenan.net.au/DesktopModules/DnnForge%20-%20NewsArticles/Print.as...

OK, is what your saying is that you wouldn’t seek a formal arrangement, I mean John Howard didn’t have a formal  arrangement so is that how you would operate in office?

Michael Keenan

We would seek their cooperation but we don’t need a formal agreement to do that, as I said we are returning Indonesian  boats to Indonesian ports and we can do that as we’ve done it in the past, without a formal arrangement with the  Indonesians.

Paul Kelly

The Government is saying this is nonsense, you can’t do it, you can’t turn the boats around, Indonesia won’t allow this to  happen. So what’s your response to that?

Michael Keenan

This was Labor Party policy. Both Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard are on the record saying that we should do this. When  they got into Government, like so many other things they said prior to the election, they didn’t implement it; they didn’t  have the courage to implement it. Now when people say that it can’t be done, the evidence to suggest that it can be done  is that we have actually done it. We did it during the Howard years and we did it very successfully because it sent a  message loud and clear to people smugglers that we were serious about stopping them.

Paul Kelly

Now what about the Australian Navy? I mean the Navy has reservations about this; how do you handle the fact that the  Navy may well be concerned about doing this.

Michael Keenan

The Navy did it very professionally in the past and I’m sure they’ll be able to do it very professionally in the future as well.

Peter Van Onselen

But they’re not so sure that they can and someone for example like former New South Wales Liberal Leader, Peter  Debnam, who spent I think about a decade as an officer in the Navy says it simply can’t be done because circumstance  have changed.

Michael Keenan

Again I point to the evidence when people say it can’t be done and that is it has been done.

Peter Van Onselen

But his point is it has changed because there is now an awareness that if they sabotage the boats when boarded they  therefore have to go to an Australian port or a Australian planned offshore arrangement rather than be able to be turned  around.

13/09/2013 http://www.keenan.net.au/DesktopModules/DnnForge%20-%20NewsArticles/Print.as...

Michael Keenan

I’m not going to go into the operational details but the Navy can certainly do this professionally and they tend to face  challenges when they implemented this policy under the Howard years but they certainly managed to do it and I have  every confidence that the Australian Navy will be able to do it again.

Simon Benson

Can I take the, what appears to be another tragedy at sea overnight have you sought or are you going to seek a briefing  on that incidence as far we know perhaps up to sixty people may have died at sea. Have you obtained any information  about it yourself?

Michael Keenan

We haven’t got any information other than what I have been able to derive from the media this morning. We will definitely  seek a briefing from the Government at the earliest possible time and this is just another reminder about this is another  terrible human tragedy on top of the other terrible human tragedies that have unfolded on our borders over the past six  years.

Simon Benson

That’s true but if the Coalition is elected in September you’ll have direct responsibility for incidents like this and when we  talk about the idea of turning back boats and whether or not that is possible you’ll be directly responsible for incidents like  this. What can you possibly do to prevent these sorts of things happening because turning back the boats clearly wouldn’t  have been a saved this or prevented a tragedy like this?

Michael Keenan

No, well what we need to do is smash people smuggling that is the problem whilst people smuggling …

Simon Benson

People have been talking about smashing people smuggling for years and it hasn’t worked.

Michael Keenan

It has worked Simon, between 2001 and 2008 we had an average of 3 boats arrive per year we had an enormous spike in  illegal boat arrivals towards the end of the 1990’s but we had a Government that showed some resolve and they were  prepared to do whatever it took to close down people smuggling and they were successful.

Peter Van Onselen

Are you prepared to do what ever it takes?

Michael Keenan

Absolutely, nobody should doubt our resolve to stop this.

Paul Kelly

13/09/2013 http://www.keenan.net.au/DesktopModules/DnnForge%20-%20NewsArticles/Print.as...

Lets take a particular example here you’ve got an asylum seek boat in international waters heading to Australian waters  and the Australian Navy intercepts the boat with the purpose is to turn it around and the boat is damaged and it starts to  sink what do you do in that situation with that boat and those asylum seekers?

Michael Keenan

I’m not going to go through all the operational things that might occur but obviously the commander on the ground will  need to make a decision and it will always be primarily concerned with safety of life at sea. The Navy and the people on  the ground will need to make judgements about how this is going to work and this is of course what they’ve done in the  past when they’ve implemented this policy and we would obviously never seek to turn a boat back around at sea where it  endangered somebody’s life but it can be done safely and it has been done safely.

Paul Kelly

How in that situation can it be done safely?

Michael Keenan

Look Paul, as I said the commander on the ground would need to make a judgement and as they have done in the past  and the evidence to show that it can be done safely is the fact that it has been done safely.

Simon Benson

Sorry, Tony Abbott last election suggested that he would take overall command of a situation like this and get on the  phone and ring the commander of a vessel on the water and order them to turn back a boat has that been abandoned or  is that still going to be your policy?

Michael Keenan

What we’ll do is the decisions will need to be made on the ground at the time

Peter Van Onselen

Will Tony Abbott have the red phone because that’s when he talked about ahead of the last election, is that still the plan  he’ll have that ability to have as Prime Minister to have a direct line to particular Captains of patrol vessels?

Michael Keenan

That’s not exactly what he said Peter, but look what we’ll do is we will issue orders for the way the Navy needs to proceed  with these things and I can obviously say we will never turn around a boat at see where it endangered anybody’s life but I  go back to the point I made before the evidence that this can be done and that it works is in the history of this issue  because it was one of the key planks we used to smash people smuggling and that’s why we are going to return to that  suite of policies.

Peter Van Onselen

So you don’t accept that circumstances are different now that there’s a more professionalised operation of people  smugglers, that there’s a greater set of push factors, all of that you reject and say its happened before and we can do it  again?

Page 7 of 13 Australian Agenda with Peter Van Onselen, Simon Benson & Paul Kelly > Michael K...

13/09/2013 http://www.keenan.net.au/DesktopModules/DnnForge%20-%20NewsArticles/Print.as...

Michael Keenan

No I don’t reject that, I think the challenge that we will inherit from the Labor party if we were to win the election is  enormous. We can’t shirk that responsibility because we can’t have a situation in Australia where we have 3000 people  arriving per month, where we have people dying at sea, where we have the Australian tax payer paying billions upon  billions of dollars to deal with the consequences of Labor’s failure and where we have a risk to our national security by not  being in charge of who comes to Australia.

Peter Van Onselen

Are you in unison with Tony Abbott and Scott Morrison that you will stop the boats by the end of the first term?

Michael Keenan

We’ve always said that we believe the measures we will implement will have an impact form day one.

Peter Van Onselen

Scott Morrison during the week repeated I think three times on Sky News “we will stop the boats” and he was talking about  that in a context of a first term. Is that an absolute commitment? At the moment we’ve got the kind of flood of arrivals that  we do, if you halve it or even bring it down by 75% is that failure because you haven’t stopped the boats?

Michael Keenan

What we’ve said is that we believe the policies we implement if we do when the election will have an impact form day one  and the Australian people will of course have the chance to judge us by the results that we achieve by the end of the first  term.

Simon Benson

So one of ASIO’s main concerns has been documentation which has been a particular problem for people arriving by boat  and I think David Irvine singled that out as a major issue particularly when comparing it to people arriving by aeroplane for  example. Scott Morrison’s policy on this is ‘No Documentation, No Assessment’ do you agree with that? Do you think  that’s fair?

Michael Keenan

That’s not Scott’s policy of course it’s our policy to presume against people who arrive here with out documentation.

Simon Benson

You’re in complete support of that? I mean people may lose their documentation, how do you know, how can you prove  whether someone’s lost their documentation or deliberately threw it over board?

Michael Keenan

This is a deliberate part of the people smuggling trade, you need documentation to have arrived in Indonesia for example  if you’ve arrived there via a plane as people often do. Now people smugglers instruct the people who are using their  services to destroy their documentation and that’s why the vast majority of people who arrive courtesy of a people  smuggler don’t have that documentation.

Page 8 of 13 Australian Agenda with Peter Van Onselen, Simon Benson & Paul Kelly > Michael K...

13/09/2013 http://www.keenan.net.au/DesktopModules/DnnForge%20-%20NewsArticles/Print.as...

Peter Van Onselen

I think the essence of Simon’s question is how do you distinguish between someone who as you say deliberately  destroyed their documentation versus someone who is an asylum seeker who quite understandably doesn’t keep papers  on them that would probably see them persecuted as they flee the nation where they have been persecuted. How do you  draw that distinction?

Michael Keenan

What we are saying is that we will presume against people who don’t have their documentation, now if they can provide a  reasonable rationale for why they don’t then that’s the case but an important part of the way people smugglers do  business, they instruct people to destroy their documentation and that means this case for example like the Egyptian

terrorist who came through is its very difficult for ASIO to confirm peoples identities even to confirm their date of birth and  look clearly we need to have an understanding about who it is that is arriving here.

Simon Benson

Not to labour on your point too much, it’s a good point. When you talk about people destroying documentation there is  evidence that that occurs but there’s also pretty strong evidence that people deliberately don’t take documentation out of a  country like Afghanistan, Hazara they obviously face severe persecution if they are caught. So how do you distinguish  again how do you distinguish between someone who legitimately arrives having no documentation for one reason or  another and someone who deliberately throws their documentation overboard?

Michael Keenan

We would need to make that judgement but can I tell you if somebody has left Afghanistan, well can I just say if somebody  has left Afghanistan and they don’t have any documentation then they would have done incredibly well to arrive in  Indonesia because you would have needed documentation along most of the points, along all of the points in that journey.

Simon Benson

That’s not necessarily the case, but a lot of the people in Afghanistan don’t have documentation to begin with.

Michael Keenan

You would not be able to get to a jumping off point to get to Australia without documentation.

Paul Kelly

If I could just ask you about the refugee determination process, the oppositions made it clear that it thinks that this process  needs to be tightened up. To what extent are you concerned that a lot of people are being approved and found to be  refugees who aren’t refugees?

Michael Keenan

We are concerned to make sure that if somebody is owed protection by Australia as a refugee that they receive it.

Paul Kelly

Well that’s not the question I asked, to what extent do you think people are getting entry and are not actually refugees?

Page 9 of 13 Australian Agenda with Peter Van Onselen, Simon Benson & Paul Kelly > Michael K...

13/09/2013 http://www.keenan.net.au/DesktopModules/DnnForge%20-%20NewsArticles/Print.as...

Michael Keenan

Australia has a very high rate of acceptance of refugees higher than if you are assessed by the United Nations. We need  to make sure we have a proper rigorous approach to that. We will give protection to people who deserve it but if people  are coming here and they are not genuine refugees then we need to be I think sensible enough to face up to that and  clearly we need to make sure the processes we have in Australia are as rigorous as possible.

Paul Kelly

Will you maintain all the current appeals base systems or will you alter that?

Michael Keenan

There’s an enormous layer of appeals that you can take in Australia.

Paul Kelly

Will you change that?

Michael Keenan

We will certainly have a look to make sure were …

Peter Van Onselen

You can only change it with a referendum cant you?

Michael Keenan

No you wouldn’t need a referendum to change that.

Peter Van Onselen

My understanding was that there is constitutional protection in place for the appeals process which Australia would need  to, that’s why we do such offshore processing to keep people away from that because Governments can’t just simple  change the appeal rights.

Michael Keenan

I think you make a good point. First of all we would have a rigorous approach to offshore processing and that means that  we don’t want people to set foot on mainland Australia. Of course that does change the way that their claims are assessed  in a legal way. Look, we believe that it’s fair you have your assessment checked, we don’t believe that you should be able  to use a constant legal process to remain in Australia when you don’t have a valid claim.

Paul Kelly

How do you stop that? How do you stop that? I mean people stay here for years because of the appeals system.

Page 10 of 13 Australian Agenda with Peter Van Onselen, Simon Benson & Paul Kelly > Michael...

13/09/2013 http://www.keenan.net.au/DesktopModules/DnnForge%20-%20NewsArticles/Print.as...

Michael Keenan

Look Paul, you stop it by having a rigorous approach to offshore processing which means the goal of offshore processing  is that people don’t set foot on mainland Australia.

Peter Van Onselen

Presumably you hope that all your offshore centres don’t get full to the point where you have to house them back here in  Australia because that’s what’s happening under Labor.

Michael Keenan

That’s why the heart of this problem always will be stopping the boats from coming in the first place.

Peter Van Onselen

Can I ask you about the international conventions? Because I think I think that most voters look at people coming via  Indonesia and consider them economic refugees because they’re jumping from Indonesia to Australia. That seems to be  an implicit part of the Coalitions narrative because you want to turn boats back to Indonesia, how does that work within the  refugee conventions that Australia has signed on to, because Indonesia is technically not a signatory nation to the UN  conventions you are technically allowed to bypass Indonesia and come to Australia because you don’t have any rights  recognised in Indonesia why or how can the Coalition continue to be a signatory to a convention which allows that, yet  turn people back to Indonesia?

Michael Keenan

I don’t quite follow the premise of your question, the refugee convention means that we owe protection to people who are  genuine refugees and we are perfectly within our rights to make a judgement whether someone is actually fleeing  persecution or they want to come to Australia because they would like a better life. Now I can understand why people  would want to do that but of course we don’t owe people protection in those circumstances.

Peter Van Onselen

The way the international law works on this is that if you get to Indonesia unless if they become a signatory nation to the  refugee convention, no problem they’re not allowed to jump from there to Australia but because Indonesia doesn’t  recognise them they are still theoretically persecuted because they have rights there. Under the conventions which may

well be antiquated this being the case, they are allowed to then keep coming to Australia. Isn’t that a reason for Australia  to pull out of the convention or try and sign Indonesia up?

Michael Keenan

I think there are problems with the convention, the convention was drafted to deal with a whole different set of  international circumstances, it was drafted to deal with a huge population flows that were left in limbo after World War  Two. I don’t think the convention ever thought about a set of circumstances where people would self select to come to  Australia from half way around the world, now I think we should work with like minded countries to make sure the  convention is up dated to reflect the fact that we live in a very different world in terms of people movement.

Paul Kelly

But do you accept the proposition that the convention doesn’t give people the right to self select the destination point?

Page 11 of 13 Australian Agenda with Peter Van Onselen, Simon Benson & Paul Kelly > Michael...

13/09/2013 http://www.keenan.net.au/DesktopModules/DnnForge%20-%20NewsArticles/Print.as...

Michael Keenan

Absolutely, yeah I think the convention-

Paul Kelly

Well that’s what’s happening isn’t it?

Michael Keenan

There is a lot of evidence to suggest that is the case. People are coming from half way round the world. It’s not like they  just crossing over the border to seek shelter. They are self selecting to come to Australia and clearly when they are doing  that we have a right to test their claims to persecution and whether we owe them protection or not.

Peter Van Onselen

Before we run out of time can I ask you about temporary protection visas, now this is something that isn’t implemented  under the current Government that is planned to be implemented under an Abbott Government, how long would you be  prepared to leave people on temporary protection visas?

Michael Keenan

The whole point of temporary protection visas is that is doesn’t translate in to permanent residence to Australia.

Peter Van Onselen

Is that ever the, so for example if you’ve, the whole point of them is you flee somewhere where you are being persecuted  but you are here as a temporary resident and upon such time as that place you’ve fled becomes safe you can be returned.  Now how long is that? There must be a time limit to it presumably.

Michael Keenan

The whole point of temporary protection visas is it undermines the people smugglers ability to sell permanent residence to  Australia. That’s why we do it because that’s the product they are selling. That’s why there …

Peter Van Onselen

How long can people be on TPV’s?

Michael Keenan

The nature of them is that it’s a temporary protection and if the circumstances within your home country change then we  would rightly expect you to return home.

Peter Van Onselen

But for what period of time, I mean if you flee a country that for ten years is in turmoil and its not safe for you to return but  then it becomes safe after ten years do you and your three children that were born in Australia over that period all head

13/09/2013 http://www.keenan.net.au/DesktopModules/DnnForge%20-%20NewsArticles/Print.as...

back or is that the end of the TPV because of the amount of time that’s passed?

Michael Keenan

The whole point of the policy is it undermines people selling permanent residence to Australia, clearly putting a time limit  on temporary protection visas is not going to have the policy effect that we want. Now if the circumstances change within  your home country and you no longer require Australia’s protection then I think it’s perfectly reasonable that you return  home. I sight Sri Lanka as an example.

Peter Van Onselen

But is that reasonable indefinitely? Because I would have thought once a person has been here for a certain length of time  it becomes incredibly disruptive to them, there children and there entire approach to life to be sent back. Not to mention  the difficulty of them actually being here during that time wondering whether its six months or six years when they might  be leaving their job here to go back to this homeland that they have fled.

Michael Keenan

Peter, we want to stop people smuggling and you stop people smuggling by undermining the product they sell and the  product they sell is permanent residence to Australia ane we want to make sure they can’t sell that product anymore.

Peter Van Onselen

Alright Michael Keenan, its been great having you on the program. We will hopefully speak to you again before the  election, this is a big issue thanks for your company.

Michael Keenan

It’s my pleasure, thank you Peter.

Peter Van Onselen

We are going to take a commercial break, when we come back wider issues in the mix this week including Kevin Rudd.  Back in a moment.
