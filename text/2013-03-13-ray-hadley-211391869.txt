E&OE……………………….…………………………………………………………………

RAY HADLEY:

Mr Abbott is on the line. Mr Abbott, g’day.

TONY ABBOTT:

G’day Ray.

RAY HADLEY:

A couple of things. You wouldn’t have heard this. I’ve just gone through an article published by Paul  Sheehan last year in light of Tanya Plibersek’s comments yesterday and today about you being to blame for  the behaviour of some people in the public gallery yesterday and the things that have been said about you  over a course of time in 2012 and I won’t repeat them, people have heard them, you know what they are.  Can you take any responsibility for some of the behaviour yesterday in the gallery?

TONY ABBOTT:

The short answer is no. Look, people should be polite to the Prime Minster. It doesn’t matter what they think  of her policies or her government, they should be polite to her. That is the respect that the senior leadership  of this country ought to be given and people certainly shouldn’t be disruptive of the Parliament. So, I  deplore any disruption, but on the other hand I think people are certainly entitled to express an opinion and  one of the things that really upsets me about this government is that it seems to be trying to bully people into  silence if they are critics of the Government and the media changes that were rushed out yesterday appear to  be a blatant attempt to bully the media - particularly to bully the News group - into going soft on its quite  justifiable criticism of this government.

RAY HADLEY:

Ok, well that’s why I wanted to talk to you. Let’s just pretend that Senator Stephen Conroy gets this  nonsense through despite the fact that Messrs Oakeshott and Wilkie look like they will oppose it and it may

well be opposed in the Upper House anyway. What will you do if you are presented with this sort of  legislation if you become Prime Minister in September?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, we will furiously oppose any attempt to impose additional regulation on the media in opposition and  we’d rescind it in government, Ray.

RAY HADLEY:

So, it would just go?

TONY ABBOTT:

It would just go. You see, what Stephen Conroy and Julia Gillard want to do is to impose an additional level  of regulation. Essentially, it is a government official vetting media coverage. Now, this is an extraordinary  step for a liberal democracy to take. I think it’s the first time in peacetime we’ve seen any such draconian  attempt to regulate the media.

RAY HADLEY:

Ok, now if I could just get to the ASADA legislation very quickly. The first reading of this was the day  before that media stunt involving Jason Clare, Kate Lundy and the Australian Crime Commission and  ASADA and the compliant chief executives of various sporting bodies, but I notice from Mr Brandis’  comments and those of the Greens overnight, it’s most unlikely that this legislation will pass the Upper  House.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, we are very concerned and the problem with what the Government has done is that they came out,  made a dramatic announcement - it was supposed to be the blackest day in Australia’s sporting history - and  yet there’s been very little evidence come out to justify it and, as things stand, it looks like this is a  government which is prepared to trash sport for the sake of getting a headline.

RAY HADLEY:

Well, you see, the thing about it is, as far as I know, we’ve had no positive tests and if there was someone in  rugby league or AFL or any other sport using performance-enhancing drugs, I’m all for getting rid of them  from sport for a long, long period of time.

TONY ABBOTT:

Exactly right, Ray. If people are using banned drugs, they should be dealt with and they should be dealt with  very harshly but you don’t go out and trash sport without hard evidence. You particularly don’t try to run  trashing sport as a smokescreen for what was happening that same day at the ICAC investigation in New  South Wales.

RAY HADLEY:

Ok, very quickly, I started the programme talking about boats. We’ve created new records. January 2012 -  308 people; January 2013 - 483; February 2012 - 887; February 2013 - 947. We’re only up to the 12th of  March and as of yesterday - 302 already compared with 115 in total in March of 2012. Nothing is working  in relation to their policy.

TONY ABBOTT:

That’s exactly right and  now you’ve got the Prime Minister running out to western Sydney talking about  457 visas as a smokescreen against her failed border protection policy. Now, there’s a world of difference  between people who come illegally to this country by boat and go on welfare and people who come legally  to this country and are contributing, working and paying taxes from day one and this is a Prime Minister and  a government which has just got its priorities all wrong. They can’t stop the illegal arrivals, so now they’re  demonising the legal arrivals. I mean, what madness possesses this government?

RAY HADELY:

Ok. Thanks for your time, as always.

TONY ABBOTT:

Thanks so much, Ray.
