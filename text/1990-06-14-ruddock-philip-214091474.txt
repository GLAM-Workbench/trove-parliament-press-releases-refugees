PRESS RELEASE

WHERE IS GERRY HAND ?

It ia now over a week since the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic  Affaire had his chat to the Prime Minister and offered advice on  how to handle the problem of Chinese Students.

Since that time the Prime Minister has stumbled almost daily with  his incoherent statements in an area of great sensitivity.

The Minister's only response to date has been to refer enquires to  the Prime Minister's office.

Now we have the Prime Minister's office minders adding comments  ostensibly to clarify the statements of the Prime Minister. By  these comments they regrettably have raised more essential  questions which need to be answered in a full and complete policy

statement.

To suggest that after some four years temporary residency (still  not confirmed by the Prime Minister), all students of the  Tiananmen Square class will be eligible for permanent residency if  desired, runs totally counter to existing policy and regulations.

Change of status applications after the 19th December 1989  Regulations can only occur within a very narrow band of  circumstances, such as family reunion (marriage to, or a de-facto  relationship with an Australian citizen or permanent resident),

skilled occupational grounds or after acceptance as a refugee.

Are these unnamed minders foreshadowing a law change which would  create a special class of status change, unavailable to other  long stay students, visitors, or illegal immigrants?

Minister Hand must now come out of the bunker.

He needs to tell usi

* how many PRC Nationals are in the pre Tiananmen Square category * how many have already left Australia, and their destination * how many have applied for grant of resident statue before the

19th December changes and in which categories * how many have applied formally for refugee status  * how many additional PRC Nationals have arrived in Australia  since the 4th June 1989  * how many in the post Tiananmen Square category have left

Australia since 19th December 1989

When the answers to these questions are upon the table it will be  readily seen why case-by-case determination of claims is absolutely  essential.

There is no justification for postponement of consideration of  claims which have already been lodged. Failure to process such  claims leaves many PRC Nationals in positions of considerable  hardship.

The Minister must now urgently address this policy issue in a  comprehensive, sensible and sensitive way. Perhaps then the Prime  Minister will be sufficiently briefed to be able to set the record  straight.

Already much harm has been done to the credibility of Australia's  immigration program and our bona fides in relation to the questions  of refugee issues is now open to question. The urgency of this  salvage operation must be apparent even to the Prime Minister.

Philip Ruddock can be contacted on (02) 858 1011 for further  comments.
