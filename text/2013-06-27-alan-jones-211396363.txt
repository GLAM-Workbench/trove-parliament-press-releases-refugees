TRANSCRIPT OF THE HON. TONY ABBOTT MHR,  INTERVIEW WITH ALAN JONES,  RADIO 2GB, SYDNEY

Subjects: Labor’s soap opera.

E&OE……………………….…………………………………………………………………

ALAN JONES:

Tony Abbott, good morning.

TONY ABBOTT:

`Morning, Alan.

ALAN JONES:

What do you make of this almost reality TV show last night?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, the chaos just gets worse. The sad thing for the Australian people is that in 2007 we voted for Kevin  and we got Julia; in 2010 we voted for Julia and now we’ve got Kevin and in 2013, if we vote Labor who  knows who we’ll end up with? This is the problem with the contemporary Labor Party. It’s poisonously  divided. It’s incompetent and it’s untrustworthy.

ALAN JONES:

We’re all over the news internationally for all the wrong reasons. What must the world be thinking of us?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, that’s a very fair question and I think they would be shaking their head in wonder and bewilderment at  a country which appeared to be very well governed for so long - that was the envy of the earth in so many  ways; was, in some respects, the miracle economy under John Howard and Peter Costello - now appears to  be reduced to this. But the problem, Alan, is that in recent times the Labor Party has been hopeless at  government but they’ve been brilliant at low politics and we saw low politics in the political execution of  Kevin Rudd three years ago and we’ve seen him return the compliment to Julia Gillard last night.

ALAN JONES:

But this is the man who began the asylum seeker fiasco. This is the author of the mining tax that produced  no money. This is the bloke who said that climate change is the greatest moral crisis of our time.

TONY ABBOTT:

And these are the things which he now has to fix. He is responsible for so many of these problems. Now, in  a very short space of time he’s got to deal with them and, you’re right, the ultimate disaster which can be  sheeted home to Kevin Rudd is the border protection chaos. He created this problem. John Howard stopped  the boats, Kevin Rudd started them up again and under Julia Gillard of course it’s got worse and worse and  worse, but Julia Gillard was much tougher on border protection than Kevin Rudd.

ALAN JONES:

You’ve never taken the electorate for granted. In fact, in all the time I’ve known you, you’ve never taken  anything for granted. You’ve had a party meeting last night. Does this require, the new leader, a change of  strategy or tactics?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, Alan, the political execution of Kevin Rudd three years ago vindicated the Coalition’s critique of him  and last night’s political execution of Julia Gillard vindicates our critique of her. So, what I think it indicates  is that our criticism of the Labor Party has been accurate all along. The Labor Party has, in a sense, accepted  our criticism of them by getting rid of their leaders.

ALAN JONES:

You go into parliament today, there is really no government. Do you fire questions at the climate change  minister who answers them? At the Education Minister? There is none. The Treasurer? There is none. Cattle  dying in Northern Territory and Queensland, there’s no Agriculture Minister. Broadband is a mess, asbestos  and the rest, and there’s no Communications Minister.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, you’re right Alan, there’s going to be an empty frontbench essentially because something like a third  of the Cabinet resigned last night and presumably there will be more resignations today. It’s hard to see how  people like Gary Gray can sit on the frontbench with Kevin Rudd after what they’ve said about him in the  last week or so. So, the only way to get strong stable government is to take the choice of the prime  ministership off the faceless men, the powerbrokers of the Labor Party, put it back in the hands of the people  and that’s why the one thing Mr Rudd really must do today is tell us when the election will be. The one  announcement that Julia Gillard successfully made over the last few months was the election date. Now  even that’s up in the air.

ALAN JONES:

A motion of no-confidence in the parliament means the parliament and through it the people believe that the  government has ceased governing effectively to the point that you can’t have confidence in it. If today  Gillard and Swan, Emerson, Garrett, Combet, Ferguson, Ludwig, Conroy, Crean are all gone from the  ministry, how could Kevin Rudd seriously claim the country is being properly governed and how could he  then defend himself against a no-confidence motion? Will you be moving no-confidence?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, Alan, I think the public are sick of the prime ministership being determined by squalid deals behind  closed doors and by parliamentary manoeuvrings. I think the best way for the Prime Ministership to be  determined is through the people’s choice at an election and the honourable way to become prime minister,  should that happen, is through an election. So, I’m not going to be pulling any parliamentary stunts today. If  there are any parliamentary stunts they’ll come from the Labor Party, but I think the public are just yearning  to take control of their country again; the public are yearning to see all of these decisions restored where  they should be, to the people.

ALAN JONES:

Just finally, because I know you’re busy and I thank you for your time, what five key points of difference  will you take to the voters?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, we will stop the boats - that’s a very big difference. We will abolish the carbon tax - that’s a big  difference. We will abolish the mining tax - that’s a big difference. We will return the workplace relations  pendulum to the sensible centre; the unions won’t be running the country - that’s a very big difference, and  we’ll get the regulatory monkey off the back of small business - because in the end what we need are  dynamic small businesses if our economy is to grow and our people are to prosper.

ALAN JONES:

Good to talk to you. Thank you for your time.

TONY ABBOTT:

Thanks so much, Alan.
