PRIME MINISTER

TRANSCRIPT OF NEWS CONFERENCE, PARLIAMENT HOUSE, 16 MAY  1990

E & 0 E - PROOF ONLY

JOURNALIST: Well, how are you feeling, Prime Minister?

PM: I'm feeling very well indeed and I'm very pleased to  report that my specialist and physician report that I'm  in excellent health and I'm just going to go and have

this routine operation which is a subject which has  caused a certain amount of ribaldry, if I may say so,  amongst my staff who are showing in these matters even  less discipline than Ministers and they are putting up  alternatives as to whether it requires the, as they put

it, the introduction of a Private Member's Bill or,  alternatively, the suspension of Standing Orders.  So the  talk such as this I find should be kept off the record,  but there's no chance of that is there? Now, OK, I'm

afraid I'll be back amongst you even more vibrant than  ever before.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, how many lives does Senator Button have to have?

PM: Does he have to have? Now that assumes that there  is -JOURNALIST:  (inaudible)

PM: Well, I think he is like all of us. He only has the  one. I had reason to have a yarn to John last night and  I believe that he will adhere to injunctions I gave and  issued and that we won't be having any further public  airing of the differences that had occurred between him  and the Treasurer.

JOURNALIST: But nevertheless he's guilty though, Prime Minister, of telling truths not lies. Things aren't,  things aren't too good.

PM: Well none of us have tried to say that things,  in the economic sense, are perfect.  But if we, if we go  into the question of the state of the economy, just let  me make a few points about that.  Two issues of course,  which are properly concerning all of us and not only in  Government, but amongst the commentators, are current

account situation and inflationary pressures. Now you've  got to understand that there are certain fundamentals  against which those questions have to be considered and  those are that in recent years, as both the Treasurer and

I have been stressing, we've been seeing record  investment levels, we've seen the public account ...  public sector in surplus and we've seen a very  significant decline in real unit labour costs. Now those

fundamentals reflect the strategy that we have been  pursuing and also another factor which both Paul and I  have been referring to, we made the point before and  during the campaign, is the very significant increase in  Australian investment overseas which has gone as, I think

I recall the figures precisely, some $7 billion when we  came to office and have gone up to $49 billion. Now, of  course, if that hadn't taken, taken ... account,  hadn't  occurred, the impact upon the current account figures  would be and our debt situation would be very, very  different. But I'm making the point that if you're

saying things aren't good and particularly that's in  terms of inflationary pressures and the current account  situation, those observations need to be against the  background of those formidably impressive and favourable  circumstances. And let me say this, that we in fact  believe and not only do we believe but the OECD  observations that have been made about the Australian  economy, we expect this situation to improve.  The OECD,

for instance, has made these observations - it's said in  respect of the savings investment imbalance, which is at  the heart of the current account problem, said firstly in  regard to housing that you could have a situation in  Australia where housing investment as a proportion of GDP  could fall in Australia and still meet your underlying  demand and they've also recently said that our, our  capital stock could continue to grow faster than GDP. In  other words, have a significant addition to your capital

stock, but with lower business investment figures than we  have had in relation to GDP at the present time. Also,  looking to the savings situation, let me say that as a  result of two factors, we expect the private saving

situation to improve in the period ahead. Firstly  because of the impact of the changes that we've made in  regard to superannuation and I and the Treasurer have  spelt those out in considerable detail before and we also  expect there 'll be a more sober use of credit in the  years ahead. So, when you take into account the fact

that we are going to see continued public sector  restraint, we believe that the current account has  considerable scope for improvement in the period ahead.  You've got to remember that, as I've said, that the  public sector is in surplus compared with what has  historically been something like two and a half percent  of GDP demand upon community savings and that fundamental  shift in the public sector, of course,  has fundamental  significance for the current account deficit. So I  apologise, in a sense, for taking so long, David, in  going to what you're saying but it's not a question, in  other words, of Senator Button having a view that things

3

are tough and others not acknowledging that fact. I am  saying that this Government has a strategy to deal with  the two fundamentals of the current account and inflation  and we believe that that strategy is going to work and  that has, of course, implications for us presently. It

means that we, if we are going to continue to be able to  claim the benefit of those circumstances, there's the  obligation which is upon us now to ensure that in this  period ahead fiscal policy remains tight. And, of  course, that's the very period we're getting into now as  we begin the preparatory processes for the Budget and I  can assure you that fiscal restraint will be continued.

JOURNALIST: Did you find it surprising that Mr Keating  did not consult with you before launching his attack on  Senator Button -PM: No -

JOURNALIST: And what was the explanation if you didn't  find it surprising, why not ...

PM: Well, I didn't regard it as an odd thing to do.  Paul and I have a very, very close and, I believe,  effective working relationship which has been  demonstrated particularly in the area of economic

management over the seven years that we have been in  office and it wasn't as though we haven't had discussions  about these sort of issues more generally and I felt that  he was entitled to make the observations that he did and

I 've said that before - I'm not now saying something new  - but it having happened I've tried to make clear to all  of the Ministers in terms of what I said in the Caucus,  Michelle, that I think the time has come for an end to  this public airing of differences of emphasis.

JOURNALIST: ... get back to Warwick's question. If  Senator Button is again publicly critical of the  Government’s performance or policy, will he stay in the  Ministry?

PM: I would think that the Senator understands full well that there is to be no repeat.

JOURNALIST: Do you expect ... to be in your Ministry at the end of the year, Mr Hawke?

PM: Yes, I would expect so.

JOURNALIST:  Mr Hawke, ...

PM:  Sure.

JOURNALIST: ... Rand Corporation report in the Telegraph  this morning.  Would your Government be prepared to speak  with the United States Government on possible relocation  of equipment and personnel to Australia -

4

PM: Well, I notice, Amanda,  that your paper headlined  the story today as though they'd found something new and  exclusive and I - with the great respect which I mean  that I have for your paper, I must point out and I hope

it's done gently and is a bit of a ... down that not only  am I aware of the report,  but I'm advised that that Rand  report is more than a year old and has been available  publicly since last December.  Ã¢ÂÂ

JOURNALIST: (inaudible)

PM: No, no but nor however is it quite entitled to  receive the, the exclusivity of a scoop that was  suggested by today's headlines. Let me just make these  points about it before going directly to answer your  question, Amanda. Let me make the point, the obvious  point that the Rand Corporation is, of course, a private  organisation and it doesn't, can't speak for the United  States Government and in any case the report does not  identify Australia as a preferred option, but it  dominates Australia as a number,  as one of a number of  possibilities. But the fact is this, Amanda, that there  have not been any approaches to the Australian Government  by the United States Government on the issues raised in  the report. No approaches at all and the negotiations  between the United States and the Philippines Government  are at a very, very early stage of discussion. There is  no reason to believe at this point, no reason to believe  at this point, that they won't lead to a conclusion that  would mean a continuation of agreement for United States  bases in the Philippines beyond 1991. But this is a  totally hypothetical question.

JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, do you accept the OECD's view that  Australians spend too much on their houses?

PM: Well, the, from the OECD perspective I can  understand that because Australians have a, as those of  you and that includes all of you who have travelled to  Europe will have noticed we have a quite different  perspective about housing. We essentially have been  brought up on the tradition of the separate quarter acre  block and, by definition, that involves expenditures and

outlays greater than a pattern of housing which is more  of a medium density type. Now I don't think it's a  question really of saying ... for the OECD to say we  spend too much, but I have said before - as you know, I'm  on the record, so are some of my other Ministers as

saying it makes a lot of sense, I believe, for Australia  to examine whether we should so automatically almost be  locked into the traditional housing approach.  Now we've  gone further than to say it's a sensible thing to look at  it. We, in discussion with the States and Local  Government who share that view with us, have initiated  processes whereby we will be testing out in Australia the  acceptability for people of more medium density housing.

This has obvious advantages of placing people closer to  places of employment and closer to places of recreation

5

and entertainment.  Now I don11 mean by that that for  those for whom this is the, the only acceptable form of  housing that it won't be the way for them, but I think if  there's one thing that's certain, it is that in the  period ahead in Australia - the rest of this century and

as we go into the next - you will see a change in the, in  the pattern of housing. You'll still have separate  quarter acre blocks, but I think you'll have more medium  density, density housing.

JOURNALIST: You are reported as having told Caucus  yesterday that because you didn't kick heads, this was  not to be seen as a sign of weakness. Would you say that  that was the case and why you felt the need to say it?

PM: Yes, I've examined with a great deal of amusement,  particularly of course in the Financial Review whose  writer in particular has a propensity to raise this issue

about leadership more often than others, been doing it,  people have been doing it for seven years.  But this  gazing at the entrails picking over the words,  now why  did he say that? Why ... this amuses me, but I, when I  go into Caucus usually have a few notes prepared. Notes

that were prepared had nothing on this subject - I just  scribbled a couple of things on the bottom of that myself  as a, just ... thought prompters to lead me to say a few  words to the Caucus at the end of my comments on the  economy. Now that was it, you know, just a couple of  notes. There was no premeditation in making the  observation about my style of leadership. It was just in

the course of making what I thought was required of me as  leader in talking to my Caucus some observations about  recent events.  And I just wanted all of the Caucus,  including Ministers, to understand in the course of  making that point that although, as was now well  established after seven years, I am not a person who is a  martinet, I don't try and get the best out of my  Ministers in that way, nevertheless that I was concerned

about this issue and that people should know. Now that's  the beginning and the end of it, but I suppose anything  for a headline and anything for a story.

JOURNALIST: On the bases question, Mr Hawke, is the  Government open to approaches from the United States on  the upgrading of military facilities here or relocation  of facilities ...

PM: Look we have a very close relationship with the United States. They can raise any matter with us they  like, they can raise any matter they like, but on this  issue just let me make the obvious point if you are

talking about bases - just one obvious point apart from  anything else because I don't think the issue will arise.  Let me make that quite clear. I don't think there will  be any suggestion of the United States approaching us.  But if they want to raise any question, the nature of our  relationship is that they can and should raise any  question on it. I don't think they will, I don't think

6

the question of bases in Australia will arise. Let me  make one obvious point that our adherence to the South  Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty would preclude, as you  would appreciate, the stationing of nuclear armaments on,

on Australian soil.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, one of the unfortunate  aspects of Monday’s slapping-down of John Button by Paul  Keating is that in saying that the Minister has failed  with his car plan he's really saying that the Government  itself has failed in this key area of microeconomic  reform.

PM: Well, no, Paul if you're going to say that you've  got to look at everything that Paul Keating said, both at  that conference and what he said subsequently. On the  Monday itself Mr Keating went out of his way - admittedly

it was on the third page of the transcript and not the  first, but nevertheless it was there in the same  conference - he went out of his way to be laudatory of  Senator Button's achievements, including in the car  industry and in industry generally. And of course as you  know in the Parliament yesterday he went further. So

there has been significant achievements in the car  industry. You'll recall the figures that the Treasurer  used yesterday that when we came to office effective  protection in the motor vehicle industry was 250% and  we've brought that down from 250% to under 100%. I think

it's about 80-odd per cent. Now you can't have that  massive reduction and talk about a lack of achievement.  But the important point for the future is that all of us  recognise, not only Paul and myself but Senator Button

and the rest of the Cabinet, that more has to be done.  And more will be done.

JOURNALIST:  ... you haven't spoken to Senator Walsh in  the same ... as you've spoken to Senator Button, why is  that given the -PM: A very simple reason. Senator Button is a Minister.  Senator Walsh is not.

JOURNALIST: But he made some very damaging comments  about ...

PM: You do understand that there is a certain thing  called Cabinet solidarity and so on and Cabinet  responsibilities which by definition don't have the same  application as someone who's not a member of the Cabinet  or the Ministry. I've had a discussion with Senator  Walsh and I made clear at the time that discussion, as

far as I'm concerned,  is private. I said to Senator  Walsh the things that I thought were appropriate to be  said to Senator Walsh.

JOURNALIST: Are you satisfied that Mr Keating  understands that distinction too, Cabinet solidarity and  all that?

7

PM: Indeed. If you want to look at Mr Keating's record,  Mr Keating's record I think is impeccable in the seven  years of this Government in terms of confidentiality

about proceedings of Cabinet and of public as well as  private commitment to the decisions of the Cabinet.

JOURNALIST: But you acknowledge that he breached Cabinet  solidarity on Monday.

PM: You can describe it that way if you wish. I'm  saying that, as I said before, I understood the  circumstances in which, confronted with what he was  confronted with, he felt it necessary to make a  rejoinder. I've said that.

JOURNALIST: Do you concede that all this could have been  prevented if you'd stepped in earlier and silenced your  Ministers?

PM: Well, if I'd attempted to impose in the first,  second, third, now into the fourth Hawke Government some  trappist,  vow of trappist silence, if I'd attempted to do  that - it was open to me to attempt to do that - but itÂ·' s  simply not my style of leadership. I believe that it's  appropriate for Ministers to be able to speak. But I've  tried to impress upon them that they should essentially -

it's not always the case - but essentially they should  adhere to their own area of responsibility. I simply say  here now as I go into my eighth year of Prime  Ministership that I '11 stand on the record of how that  has worked.  It has worked well in terms of the processes  of decision-making, the actual decisions themselves, and  generally speaking the communication of those decisions

to the public. Obviously you can always do better in  communications than you have actually done. There’s  always room for improvement. But over the seven years  it's, I think, been remarkably successful. And may I say  basically there's been a remarkable cohesion in the  Cabinet.  Importantly that's not only my judgement but

it's the judgement of your comrades.  In fact if you read  the press in the last day or so they are saying really  why this sticks out at the moment is because it's against  the background of a remarkable degree of cohesion in the  period of the Hawke Government,  and it stands out the  more. Now it having been a strength in the past, I'm not  going to see that strength dissipated. Enough is enough

and I've made it clear and I won't tolerate any egregious  breaking of the injunction that I've given to my  Ministers.

JOURNALIST: Why do you think it has happened at this ...  Prime Minister? Why do you think this lack of discipline  has occurred?

PM: Well as I said, we're now going into the, as I put  it to the Caucus, the unchartered waters of a fourth  successive government.  I don't know whether some

8

Ministers may have felt that there was an invincibility  about us or that now we didn't have to exercise the same  sort of disciplines we had in the past. It may have just  been the post-election let down - probably the answer  more than anything else. But it's not going to be

accepted by me, it's got to come to an end.

JOURNALIST: What are you going to do if the wool  industry decides to leave the ... exactly where it is

PM: Well I would hope Paul that the wool industry will understand that they have a responsibility to the whole  of their members and to this country and that they have  got to be making decisions which are valid for the medium  and to long term. That's what underlies the approach

that we've taken in decisions we made and which I  understand that the Opposition now supports. Mr Kerin  will be talking with the industry and I would rather at

this stage assume that they are going to see good sense  in this matter. If they don't well then we'll have to  consider it at that time. But I would hope that when  they're confronted, as I understand they will now ...

situation of a common Government and Opposition position  that they will understand what needs to be done.

JOURNALIST: Post-election, did you offer Senator Button  the position of High Commissioner to London and is that  offer still open?

PM: The answer to that is, very simply, whatever  discussions I have with my Ministers on this or any other  sort of matter is confidential between the Minister and  myself.

JOURNALIST: Returning ... medical.

PM: Oh yes, yes.

JOURNALIST: Very often when these reminders of our mortality come to us we take a longer term perspective.  Now you are committed to what will be ten years in the  Lodge.

PM: Yes.

JOURNALIST: It's a long time, hard yakka. You've got an  able replacement ... Time for a rethink ...?

PM: No not at all. I'm thrilled actually with the diagnosis that's been made of me by the gentlemen who are  professional and expert in this matter and -JOURNALIST: Are you talking about doctors here or politicians?

PM: I'm referring to the guts, if I may say so, of your  question. It's a matter of pride to me the diagnosis

9

they made of my physical condition. Modesty forbids me  from telling you exactly, either in the general or in the  specifics, about their diagnosis. But I'm an  extraordinarily fit 60 year old. So there is not only no  reason, medical reason for rethink, but on the contrary  the analysis that they've made of my physical condition  gives me cause to, if anything,  to think of longer

reflectives.  But not necessarily in The Lodge.

JOURNALIST: ... don't have any spine problems ...?

PM: No, they discovered one and they thought it was in  very very sound condition.

JOURNALIST:  ... stay full term.

PM: Yes.

JOURNALIST: But Prime Minister has it been troubling  you, did it trouble you during the election campaign?

PM: Amanda,  these things get somewhat delicate, and you  know I have a long record of delicacy. Let me put it  this way. There was one very very crowded function where  I couldn't give them my immediate attention. I needed a

little bit of relief before I was able to concentrate  fully upon them.

JOURNALIST:  (inaudible)

PM: It was at a hospital. It was at the Repat Hospital  in Sydney. ...

JOURNALIST: Do you have any advice to Paul Keating as to  how to handle the ... of Acting Prime Minister?

PM: I think low-key is what - well did he not act low- key. I mean he's done it once and I think he did an  excellent low-key job while I was representing the  country in Gallipoli. I would imagine that he would, I  would be very surprised if he wasn't low-key actually.

JOURNALIST: Is it going to be possible for the  Government to ... living standards generally and real  wages in particular in this next three years and ... you  find any specific point that Senator Button made over the  weekend objectionable?

PM: I'm not - just going to the last part of your  question first - I'm not reviving the weekend's events  ... It would be a very unintelligent thing for me to do.  But as to the first part of your question, what you've  got to understand is that as far as the question of

living standards is concerned,  they are determined by  essentially these matters.  They are determined by  employment - whether you've got a job or not. Secondly  by wages.  Thirdly by taxes. Fourthly by pattern of  social service expenditures. If you look therefore in

1 0

respect of those in employment, we are in the midst of  the '89-90 wage-tax deal and so with the combination of  the wage increases that will flow out of that and the  reduction in taxes for those in employment and given the  assumptions about prices, which is of course the other  element in real living standards, one can see some  marginal real improvements taking wage movements,  tax  movements,  prices together.  Now if you therefore want to  move to the next step and try and get some sort of

aggregate figure you’ve got to ask yourself what is going  to happen to employment. Well obviously there is going  to be a slowdown in the rate of employment growth.  We  had a situation 12 months ago where employment was  growing at five per cent per annum. That's not  sustainable. The 12 months to April figure are 2.7%.  That's the latest annualised rate of growth. So it's  still a significant rate of growth and is consistent of  course with the analysis that I and the Treasurer are  making of how we see the soft landing outcome.  That is  consistent with some marginal increase in the  unemployment rate. You can't in the end be dogmatic  about that because it depends, you know, the bit variable  in that is the participation rate which is quite a  volatile figure and which is currently at a very high

level. So those in employment, you would see a marginal  improvement in living standards. And of course as far as  the rest of the community is concerned, you are aware of  what we have in inflation terms of the significant

improvements over the past in the value and then the  maintenance of the value and the real benefits of those  entitlements.

JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, the changing pattern in housing  that you mentioned, over what period do you see this  happening and do you foresee redevelopment in ... areas?

PM: That's in fact going on and I referred to decisions  that we've made with the State Governments actually to  fund pilot projects of that sort. Now this is in fact  happening and the interesting thing from my point of view  is that there has been a positive response both from  State Governments and Local Governments to the need to  make the changes necessary to facilitate this sort of  development.  Barriers to it in the past have been  regulations of Local Government and some attitudes of  State Governments.  But there is an acceptance of the  need for change in that area and there is cooperation  with State and Local Governments in the development of

these pilot projects.  Now my assumption is that as pilot  projects come into being and are seen to be successful, I  think you will see a growth in this movement. Now to try  and put a precise figure on the rate of change is not

sensible other than to say I'm sure that it will move in  the direction that I've been talking about.

JOURNALIST: Will you sack Senator Button if he steps out of line again?

1 1

PM: That question's already been asked and answered.

JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, do the recent comments by Senator  Button and any number of other Ministers reflect a  growing uncertainty or loss of faith in the Cabinet about  the effectiveness of the Government's economic policy?

PM: No, I don't believe so. Let me say that, as I think  I indicated before, Julie, that there is no doubt that  the country faces the sorts of problems that I talked  about which essentially come under the headings of the  current account problem and the inflationary pressure  problem. I think Ministers are aware that it's a bit  disconcerting to them that it is the case but they are

aware of the fact, I think, that we face in this upcoming  Budget round some more difficult decisions in expenditure  restraint.  It is the case that they get harder each time  by definition and we've done the relatively easy  expenditure cutting in the early years and so each year  you get on and you've got to do some more, it gets harder  and I think they find that a little bit upsetting and  disconcerting. But I think there is a basic faith in the  members of the Cabinet and indeed of the Caucus that the  essential strategy that we've got is right and we're just  going to have to have the courage to keep on making the  necessary decisions in the current period to sustain that

strategy and an essential part of that is a maintained  fiscal restraint, and we'll do it. We'll require it of  ourselves and of the States.

JOURNALIST: Not including fiscal restraint.

PM: Continuing fiscal restraint.

JOURNALIST: Does that mean a Budget surplus of more than  the current -PM: It means a significant Budget surplus.

JOURNALIST: Do you think you've .... out Senator Walsh  in that process?

PM: If you've got a question about Senator Walsh's physical condition then you should address the question  to him.

JOURNALIST: One of the other problems that's been  getting more of an airing is the -PM: One of the?

JOURNALIST: Immigration's been getting an airing by  Senator Walsh and others. Do you welcome any new public  debate and what about the suggestion that the ethnic  groups have got too much power with the ...

PM: I welcome any informed and unprejudiced debate in this country about immigration. Probably more than any

1 2

one in this Parliament, I have been associated with the  development of Australia's immigration policy. I say  that on the basis of the fact to my earliest days of the  ACTU as a research officer then as president. I was very  much involved with the trade union movement, in

cooperation with the then conservative governments, in  trying to have a bipartisan policy. I did a lot of work  both as research officer and then as president of the  ACTU in ensuring that the labour movement, in its broader  sense, would be supportive of an expansionary immigration  policy. I played an important role in that and as you've  heard me say before, indeed one of the things that  impelled me into joining the Labor Party back in 1947, my

first year at university, was the sense of excitement  that I had as a young man then in what the then Labor  Government was doing in undertaking that vast immigration  policy. I saw it as something in which was going to be

fundamental to the future of this country. So more than  anyone in this Parliament I have a commitment to  immigration and what it has meant for this country. But  that doesn't mean that I think that there is a sacredness  about this issue which precludes debate - that this is  merely a matter for the Government on high saying here's  what the figure is, all the rest of you people accept it.  On the contrary it's because I understand what the

importance of immigration has been to the very nature and  quality of Australia that I welcome discussion and  informed and non prejudiced debate in the community. I  will expect my Minister to come to the Cabinet with  detailed proposals about next targets and I look forward

at the end of the year, it's in November, to the  conference which is being organised by the research unit  of the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. We  can only as a country, in my judgement, be improved as a

society if, as a society, we discuss this issue,  understand what the contribution of immigration has been  in the past to Australia, to understand that that  contribution has been not merely economic but it's been  social, it has gone to the whole question of what sort of  country we are. We are a richer, more diverse, better  country now because of the fact that we have been a  country of large immigration. Now we've got to ask  ourselves what's the best way on that magnificent basis

that we've built in now getting on for half a century of  this sort of approach, what's the sort of decision that  is best called for now and always in that debate economic  considerations are going to be important. From the very  beginning when the concept of massive post-war

immigration was conceived by the Curtin and Chifley Labor  Governments, economic capacities and economic  implications were at the very centrality of their  consideration and they must remain so. There is

legitimate room for difference about the economic  implications of immigration both in the immediate term  and in the medium and the longer term, very legitimate  grounds for differences of opinion as to economic

implications.  We'll be better off as a society if we  have these discussions out in the open without rancour

13

and with respect to the opinions of one another, there is  only one factor in which I will ... no discussion and  that, as far as I'm concerned, and that is any  proposition based upon racism. Any proposition, any  element in the debate that some people, some group of  people are second class or third class human beings.  That element of the debate as far as I'm concerned will  not be tolerated. Everything else is legitimately and  properly on the table and I will encourage it.

JOURNALIST: How well informed and unprejudiced is the  current level of debate?

PM: I think generally speaking it is unprejudiced. I  think those who have a racial prejudice are in a minority  in the country. In the area of economic debate, there's  always room for improvement and indeed it is the case  simply that economists are divided upon the issue and  that's why as far as I'm concerned the more debate, the  better about this.

JOURNALIST: What about the second part of Amanda's  question when she ... apparent influence of the ethnic  lobby?

PM: I'm sorry, yes I overlooked that. No I don't think  they have an undue influence. It is appropriate that  governments and oppositions as they have in this period  which is ... now nearly half a century old in this  country, I think governments and oppositions have always

listened to what representatives of their community have  got to say, I think that's a proper part of the  democratic process and indeed this should be of special  encouragement to our newer citizens to make them know

that we want to hear what they've got to say. But as far  as I'm concerned they won't have an undue influence. I  and my Minister will want to hear what they've got to  say. In the end their voice will be one of several in us  coming to our final decision. I must go I'm sorry.
