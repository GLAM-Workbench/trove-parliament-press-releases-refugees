PETER DUTTON’S REGIONAL RESETTLEMENT DISASTER



Immigration Minister Peter Dutton has today set a new benchmark in  incompetence.

DUTTON: We've been anticipating the Supreme Court decision in PNG  and we've been planning for this since late last year.

STEFANOVIC: Gee, I tell you what, when the Prime Minister finds out  that you've said that you've known for months this was coming and  made the announcement yesterday that you had no road map. It  doesn’t say much about your planning does it, doesn’t say much about  his planning.

DUTTON: Well Karl, I just don't know how you can draw that conclusion  though…

STEFANOVIC: Well, because you say you’ve known for months this  ruling was coming and yesterday he said we have no road map. How  long does it take the Prime Minister does to come up with a road map?

DUTTON:  Well the Prime Minister's has been part of these discussions  for a long period of time.

STEFANOVIC: And how long does it take you to come up with a road  map, if you've known for months?

DUTTON: Well, the point that we were making yesterday was that the  PNG Government itself had said that they hadn't yet had time to  contemplate the individual judgements that were made. Now, we  respected and that's why it was appropriate for the Prime Minister to say  what he said.

This is a critical moment for Australia’s regional resettlement program.





Labor has been on the record calling for the urgent need to secure a third  country arrangement that offers refugees a viable long term settlement future.

Peter Dutton should be in Port Moresby dealing with this issue and articulating  his contingency plan.

Whatever decision the Australian Government takes, it must not risk sending a  green light to people smugglers that they can revive their deadly trade.
