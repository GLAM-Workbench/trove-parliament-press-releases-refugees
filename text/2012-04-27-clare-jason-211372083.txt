23 BOATS AND TONY ABBOTT STILL SAYS ‘NO’

The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Chris Bowen MP, and Minister for Home  Affairs, Jason Clare MP, said the latest asylum seeker boat intercepted - carrying 60  passengers - is the 23rd since Tony Abbott and the Coalition said ‘no’ to offshore processing.

“It’s no surprise that Mr Abbott keeps saying ‘no’ to the national interest, as he’s only  interested in negativity and cheap slogans rather than workable policy solutions,” Mr Bowen  said.

“We all know that turning back boats is dangerous, Nauru won’t work to prevent boat  journeys on its own, and temporary protection visas led to more women and children risking  their lives at sea.

“As all the expert advice to Government has said, we need a genuine deterrent - such as  the Malaysia Arrangement - to stop people from taking these dangerous boat journeys.”

Mr Clare said Mr Abbott needs to stop playing politics on this issue and act in the national  interest now.

“Working together we can help stop people dying at sea. We can pass legislation to  introduce offshore processing,” Mr Clare said.

“If Mr Abbott is serious about stopping the boats he must stop saying no and pass our  legislation to allow asylum seekers to be processed offshore in Malaysia and Nauru.”
