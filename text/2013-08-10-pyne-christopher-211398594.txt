TRANSCRIPT OF THE HON. CHRISTOPHER PYNE MP  INTERVIEW WITH DAVID LIPSON  SKY NEWS  Subjects: Polls, Education, Indigenous Policy, Labor candidates



E&OE...............................





PRESENTER: The polls out today suggest that the honeymoon for Kevin Rudd is  over, that must be heartening for your side of politics.



PYNE: Well the polls will come and go David and that old clichÃÂ© “the only poll that  counts is the one on election day” is now worth saying because, in four weeks the  Australian public will have the chance to make a vote and determine who should  lead the country.

So obviously it’s - the Rudd honeymoon has well and truly come to a shuddering halt  and that doesn't surprise any of us who have known him for a long time because the  more you get to know Kevin Rudd the less people like him, the further you get away  from him the more he seems like a reasonable person so the Australian public are  starting to remember all the reasons why they wanted him gone in the first place.

Three years ago things like the pink bats disaster, the fact that he makes promises  people know he will never keep, his constant over egging of the pudding; but the  polls themselves I'm going to dismiss most of those until election day.



PRESENTER: Well Tony Abbott is doing very well in the issues of trust and the  economy, but on education the coalition is still trailing by about 20 points, that’s your  portfolio area, does that suggest that perhaps the Coalition, or do you regret I should

perhaps ask, the coalition going so hard against the better schools funding  arrangement initially, is that part of the reason for the difference there?



PYNE:  David this is an election about the economy, it’s about border protection, it’s  about cost of living, job security, economic management, it is not an election about  education because whoever gets elected they will deliver exactly the same funding  envelope for schools.

The difference between Labor and Liberal on education is that we believe there  should be more local authority in both government schools and non-government  schools and we believe that there should be a relentless focus on teacher quality.  Now the overall election though will be an election about whether people believe  they can afford to re-elect Labor for another three years after the last six years of  chaos and dysfunction and division and hopeless economic management.



PRESENTER: OK well moving on; Tony Abbott is heading to Arnhem Land today  where he will announce that Warren Mundine will take up an advisory role for  indigenous policy, why is Warren Mundine needed in that area?



PYNE: Well Warren Mundine has a long history in Indigenous Issues in Australia and  he obviously crosses the political divide having been a president of the Australian  Labor Party, so what Tony Abbott is doing is ensuring that indigenous issues  become a bipartisan issue and is making it a personal crusade of his own. I’ve been  with Tony Abbott in the (...inaudible.. ) here in south Australia, I’ve seen how he  interacts with Indigenous people,  and I’ve seen how he has a genuine and real  concern to address the issues in indigenous Australia like health and education  school attendance, employment rather than focusing on symbolism, he wants to  focus, he wants to get the symbolism right of course but he wants to focus on  outcomes for Indigenous Australians that make our lives safer, and give them jobs  and give them education.



PRESENTER: Has the Department failed to provide adequate advice, is that why  Warren Mundine is needed?



PYNE: Well Tony Abbott wants to bring a real focus on Indigenous issues if he's  elected as Prime Minister and therefore having a Prime Ministerial advisory council  headed by Warren Mundine seems a very smart way to go.



PRESENTER: Well the Government says on another matter that its asylum seekers  ads need to be continued because they are starting to work, its unconventional of  course during caretaker period and it could in the end benefit Labor, but if it also  stops drowning at sea, is it worth it?



PYNE: Well David they're not just prepared to controversially run ads that are  blatantly politically ads, they are trashing the caretaker convention we are into the  fourth week, or the fourth week from the election, and there is absolutely no basis for  the government to run their party political advertising campaign in Australia about  their new people smuggling policy. If that was being run in Afghanistan or in Iran or  Iraq or Sri Lanka then you would think that would have an impact; by running in  Australia there is one reason to run it and that is its for vote people not boat people  and it’s a disgraceful trashing of the caretaker conventions when the government  effectively is no longer in government unless it is rejected on September the 7th, but  its typical of a government that is desperate and prepared to throw the rule book out  to try and cling to power with more dodgy deals and more arrangements for the  Labor party to stay in power.



PRESENTER: Taxpayer funded ads did run under john Howard in caretaker period  though?



PYNE: But they weren't in this kind of political charged area where the ads  themselves have been criticised as being designed for vote people not boat people  and therefore the Labor Party should have avoided the controversy especially  compromising the public services they are by running these ads.



PRESENTER: OK, well you've raised a couple of concerns to me about a number of  candidates for the ALP, one in Kennedy and one in the seat of Hotham, just explain  to us what your concerns are about these two ALP candidates?



PYNE: Well Kevin Rudd has some explaining to do today when he's questioned in  Tasmania when he arrives there this afternoon about whether he genuinely has a  view about reforming the Labor party to make it a better party, or whether it’s just  more of his all talk and no action because the candidate for Hotham has admitted  today that he abused a woman in a wheelchair some years ago, swore at her and  threatened her and also that he stalked a political opponent; and the candidate for  Kennedy has said Tony Abbott would bring back the white Australia policy in a flash,  essentially accusing him of being a racist, what I want to know is what is Kevin Rudd

going to do about both of those candidates today? What actions is he going to take  about the candidate for Hotham and the candidate for Kennedy, will they be  disciplined or will they be dis-endorsed or will no action be taken because if no action  is taken...



PRESENTER: What do you say he should do?



PYNE: Well that’s a matter for Kevin Rudd, but he needs to put his money where his  mouth is.  Does he genuinely believe in trying to make the Labor Party a better party  or is it all just more of his all talk no action policy which the Australian public are so  used to, and as you saw in the polls earlier are starting to see through again, if Kevin  Rudd does nothing just dismisses it as he has the pink bats fiasco then he is just  proving Kevin Rudd has not changed and a leopard doesn't change his spots.



PRESENTER: Also today reports Anthony Albanese the Transport and the  Infrastructure Minister allowed a number of Virgin flights to land at Sydney airport,  the allegation that it was because there were politicians on board, MPs on board,  what do you make of that and those reports?



PYNE: Well I think Anthony Albanese has some serious questions to answer today  and he needs to come out today and explain what the story is behind these reports  on the front page of the Daily Telegraph, the curfew in Sydney as most people would  know is something of a taboo subject, so if Anthony Albanese has waived the curfew  in order to benefit members of parliament, then that needs to be explained if it’s not  true he needs to deny it, if it is true he need...  (video break)

Anthony Albanese is having a shocker of campaign and he needs to come out today  and explain what he truth is behind the story in the Daily Telegraph.



PRESENTER: Christopher Pyne, we're out of time but thanks very much for that.



PYNE: Always a pleasure.
