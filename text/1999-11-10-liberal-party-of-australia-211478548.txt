SCHOOL STUDENTS SAY AUSTRALIAN TROOPS IN EAST 
TIMOR ARE CONTINUING THE ANZAC SPIRIT

Â

Â

The contribution of the Au stralian troops serving in East Timor 
was one of the major themes in this year’s Simpson Prize Essay Competition, 
the details of which were today announced by the Minister for Education, 
Training and Youth Affairs, Dr David Kemp.

Â

“Young people want to learn more about Australia’s 
history as well as the current events shaping our future. It’s heartening 
to see that our young people appreciate the clear link between Australia’s 
contribution to the International Force operating in East Timor and 
the great ongoing traditions of the ANZAC spirit," said Dr Kemp.

Â

The Simpson prize is awarded annually to Year 9 secondary 
school students from each State and Territory in honour of John Simpson 
Kirkpatrick, the man with the donkey, whose bravery and compassion has 
become known as epitomising the ANZAC spirit.

Â

Students entering the competition were required to 
submit essays focussing on the significance of ANZAC Day and how they 
believed ordinary Australians during wartime demonstrated the qualities 
of courage, mateship, determination and sacrifice and how those qualities 
are still relevant today.

Â

“The Commonwealth Government created the Simpson 
Prize to encourage students to think and talk about what ANZAC Day means 
to them and to their country. At this time of year we remember all those 
who have died defending Australia during times of conflict and I have 
been extremely impressed with the level of interest our school students 
have in our ANZAC history,” said Dr Kemp.

Â

“Over 1,000 essays were submitted to the competition. 
In addition to the theme of East Timor, many students believed the values 
of the ANZAC spirit manifested itself in everyday life as shown through 
the support many local communities provided for the Kosovar and East 
Timorese refugees.”

Â

The winning students and their teacher chaperones 
will travel to Turkey from 19 27 April 2000 to attend the dawn service 
and other activities.

Â

Dr Kemp also announced prizes for the runners-up in 
each State and Territory. Their prize will be to join the study tour 
winners in Canberra in February 2000 for a two-day forum based at significant 
national institutions such as the Australian War Memorial and Parliament 
House.

Â

A list of the prize winners and runners up is attached.
