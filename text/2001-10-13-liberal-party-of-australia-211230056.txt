TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER THE HON JOHN HOWARD MP VETERANS’ AFFAIRS POLICY LAUNCH, EPPING, SYDNEY

E&EO…………………………………………………………………………………………

Well thank you very much Bruce, to my other parliamentary colleagues, Senator Bill Heffernan, Senator Maurice Payne, senators from New South Wales, Kerry Chikarovski the leader of the New South Wales opposition, Andrew Tink the shadow minister for police and correctional services and the member for Epping, and Brian Pezutti a member of the New South Wales upper house.  Can I also again thank Charles Brown and Peter Strachan of the Epping RSL club for making this magnificent facility available for this launch.  I really do appreciate it very much.

The Epping RSL club in the tradition of all RSL clubs in Australia is a great community organisation and makes it facilities available to all shades of political and community opinion. And it is a great credit to its leadership and to its membership.

I am particularly pleased to be able to launch this veterans’ affairs policy of the Coalition here in my own electorate.  I do so with a great deal of pride and a great deal of conviction.  And may I say how particularly pleased I am to launch this policy in front of a flag for which I have always had unwavering support.

It has always been the policy of my party and always will be, without qualification, without bowing to temporary fad or fashion to support the retention of the Australian flag as a proper expression both of the history, the contemporary experience and the future of our nation.  I’m also conscious that I launch this policy at a time when inevitably our thoughts may well turn to people who in the not too distant future might become on behalf of our country and in the name of freedom, veterans of military combat and military participation.  It is therefore an especially poignant time to be launching a veterans affairs policy.  It is an opportunity for me again to record my admiration and respect and gratitude for my generation on behalf of all of those of earlier generations and of future generations who served their country and put their lives on the line to preserve the freedom that we enjoy.

The world does face an enormous challenge at present.  The fight against terrorism is difficult, it is new, it is unprecedented in its scale and the future is difficult to know with certainty.  But one thing we can be certain about and that is this, that history tells us if we turn

away from threats in the vain hope that they will disappear of their own volition, we will be sadly mistaken. And as the generation I look out on and that is the generation of World War II, knew and learnt far better than any generation in the history of Australia, indeed the history of the world.  It was the refusal of free peoples and free men and women to recognise the nature of the challenge in the 1930s that bought about the terrible events with such awful consequences of World War II.

Now although the circumstances and the scale is different, the principle involved is the same. We must and we will stand with our American allies and our American friends in defence of the things that we hold so dear and we hold in common.  And we think at a time like this not only of people who were veterans of World War I and World War II, of Korea, of Vietnam, of Malaya, but also those that in more recent times have served with such great distinction in places such as Bougainville and East Timor. We think also of the magnificent service under very difficult circumstances of the men and women of the Royal Australian Navy who have served on vessels such as HMAS Manoora which has taken some of the illegal asylum seekers to Nauru.  We think of those who are serving on HMAS Adelaide and all the other vessels and we think particularly of those who may at some time in the not too distant future be asked to serve the cause of liberty, the cause of freedom and the cause and the defence of their own country as part of allied activity against terrorism.

We are very proud of the policy launched today, entitled “Supporting Those Who Served”. Because what this policy does is to build on five and a half years of improvements to the support available to our veterans and to our war widows.  And it also commits the Coalition to further extending recognition health care and compensation to these Australians who have a very special place, not only in our community but in our hearts.  And at a time when Australia has once again committed itself to international efforts against aggression we are reminded of the contributions of earlier generations.  And it is the acknowledgment of this proud tradition by a grateful Australian community since World War I that has ensured that we have the most comprehensive and best repatriation system in the world.

Over the last five and a half years there have been a number of initiatives of the Coalition Government.  And in recording these initiates let me also pay tribute to initiatives of earlier governments of both sides of politics that have contributed to looking after the veterans of Australia.  As many of you will know I have always endeavoured as far as it is possible in the nature of political combat and political rivalry to ensure that attitudes towards benefits for veterans is kept on as bipartisan a basis as possible in accordance with the very proud bipartisan traditions of returned service men and women all around Australia.

Over the last five and a half years the Gold Card has been extended to provide comprehensive free health coverage to a further 38,000 Australian veterans aged over 70 with World War II qualifying service.   In the last budget the Coalition provided a $25,000 tax free cash payment to Australian service personnel and civilians held prisoner of war by the Japanese during World War II and to their surviving widows.  The Coalition Government legislated to link the service and war widows pensions to 25 per cent of male total average weekly earnings when consumer price index increases failed to maintain that benchmark.  We also restored the pension rights of thousands of war widows who had their pensions cancelled when they chose to remarry.  And can I on a personal note say that it was in the boardroom of this very club some six or seven months ago that I met two constituents of mine representing the interests of that category of Australian war widows and it was that conversation that in the end proved conclusively to me that this was a priority that ought to be dealt with in the last budget.

In the area of health, $3.2 million has been provided to support Vietnam veterans and their families addressing the validated findings of the Vietnam veterans health study. We’ve also spent over $391 million since 1996 to help older veterans stay in the family home through initiatives like veterans home care.  For the 150,000 veterans living in remote and regional areas of Australia we have spent over $40 million in health and counselling initiatives and opened more than 70 veterans affairs regional offices.  In the last budget we extended the repatriation pharmaceutical benefits scheme to up to 47,000 British, Commonwealth and allied veterans who are aged 70 or over, have qualifying service from World War II and have lived in Australia for more than ten years.

In the area of commemoration this government has of course has been an active and generous supporter of the Australian National War Memorial and I was especially touched and proud when some eight weeks ago during the Ausmin talks attended on behalf of the United States by the Secretary of State Colin Powell and the Secretary of Defence, Donald Rumsfeld and the Commander-in-Chief of the American Forces in the Pacific Admiral Blair, we had dinner at The Lodge with them as our guests and my two ministerial colleagues Alexander Downer and Peter Reith.  Admiral Blair and the Secretary for Defence remarked to me how tremendously impressed they had been with our War Memorial.  In fact Admiral Blair said it is without doubt the best War Memorial in the world and one for which Australians should be particularly proud.

Now we will continue our generous support of plans to expand the War Memorial.  I recently opened the commemorative ANZAC Hall and I expect to have discussions with the Chairman of the Council of the War Memorial and also with the Director to discuss further plans for the development and expansion of what remains the outstanding point of attraction for Australians who visit our national capital.  We also funded the $5 million documentary series Australians at War.  We provided $1.2 million for the new ANZAC commemorative site at Gallipoli which I opened along with the Prime Minister of New Zealand on ANZAC day in the year 2000 and $6 million for a new memorial to Australian servicemen and women which is scheduled to be opened in London on ANZAC day in the year 2003 and it will be the first permanent and significant memorial in the United Kingdom to those tens upon tens of thousand who put their lives on the line in the defence of Great Britain particularly during World War II.  Those are the things that we have done and they are an earnest of our commitment to the support of the veterans’ community in Australia.

I am very pleased to announce three new initiatives that will be implemented by the Coalition Government if it is returned to office at the election on the 10th of November.  We are of course particularly concerned to meet the health needs of veterans within our community and therefore this policy commits the Coalition to extending the Gold Card to Australian veterans of Post World War II conflicts who are 70 years of age or over and who have the necessary qualifying service.

Secondly and of equal importance the Coalition will also ensure that our war widows receive more appropriate compensation.  We therefore intend to unfreeze the income support supplement that was frozen in 1986 and to index the payment to increases in male total average weekly earnings or the Consumer Price Index which ever is the greater.  This measure, which will cost some $70 million over four years will directly benefit about 85 000 war widows in Australia.

Ladies and Gentlemen, the Coalition is also aware that some groups of ex-servicemen and women may have a claim to entitlements under the Veterans Entitlement Act but are currently denied access to benefits because of perceived anomalies and injustices in the definition of

qualifying service.  These groups include some World War II veterans currently without qualifying service.  Veterans of the British Commonwealth Occupation forces of Japan, participants of British atomic testing in Australia and servicemen engaged in counter terrorist and special recovery training.  The Coalition is committed to a high profile and independent review to consider anomalies within the current eligibility criteria for veterans’ entitlements. This review will be conducted in the early New Year and in close consultation with the ex-service community.  It will seek to focus on perceived anomalies and injustices in the current provisions determining access to veterans’ benefits.  We’ll continue ladies and gentlemen to encourage younger Australians to learn more about and commemorate the sacrifices made by Australians of earlier generations who secured for the young of today the freedoms they now enjoy and I know to all of us whether we are veterans or not, one of the most pleasing things about the evolution of Australians’ attitudes towards this country and its history and its past and its achievements is the way in which the young are taking to themselves an understanding and an affection for what the men and women of earlier years did in the defence of this country.

I have said before and it is appropriate that I repeat it again this morning that probably as moving a day as I have had in the five and half years that I have been Prime Minister of this country was on ANZAC day last year when Janette and I attended along with the Prime Minister of New Zealand and her husband, the ANZAC Commemoration on ANZAC Cove and opened the new commemoration site.  It was a very moving service, it was a magnificent day made absolutely unforgettable by the 12 000 to 15 000 young Australians and New Zealanders who packed the shores of ANZAC in a robustly Australian but always totally respectful commemoration of what those deeds long ago meant to them and meant to our country.  It has almost become to that generation a rite of passage as an Australian young man or woman. It was moving, it was different and it was something a generation ago I don’t think many of us would have thought was likely to come about.  And it is a reminder of the great affection in which a generation of Australians that the great body of his room represent.  It is a reminder of the great affection in which you are held by your fellow Australians and I hope the repatriation programs that have been put in place by successive Australian Governments of both sides of politics and I hope these policies which I have announced today if the Australian people re-elect us and we therefore have the opportunity of implementing them.  I hope that they will be part of a long continuum of the never ending gratitude that Australians feel for those who put their lives on the line.  Many of those lives were lost, thankfully so many were not, and the least we can do is to honour their service for the rest of their lives.

So again to you Charles thank you for making Epping RSL Club available.  I commend this policy to the Veteran community.  I reaffirm my strong personal support for you, my great respect for what you have done and the ongoing desire of the Government to help you.  And very finally can I think Bruce Scott for the tremendous job that he has done as the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs.  Bruce is a very good friend.  Bruce is a very good friend to veterans and I know and I can assure you he is a powerful advocate for your cause.

Thank you very much.

Executive Summary





In the five and a half years since coming to Government, the Coalition  has demonstrated a strong commitment to extending the care and  benefits available to Australia’s Veterans and War Widows.  In that  time, the budget for the Veterans’ Affairs portfolio has grown from $6.2  billion to $8.7 billion.  Many of the anomalies and injustices left behind  by Labor have been addressed.

Supporting Those Who Served will continue this support.  It commits  the Coalition to extending health care entitlements, improving  compensation arrangements and reviewing the fairness of the current  Repatriation system.  These initiatives will guarantee the special level  of entitlement and recognition for the service and sacrifice of these very  special Australians, our Veterans and War Widows.

Part 1 Better Health Care for Veterans

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ A  third  Howard  Government  will  extend  the  Gold  Card  to  provide   comprehensive  free  health  care  to  Australian Veterans who are 70  years of age and with qualifying service.  This extension of the Gold  Card will cost $73.5 million over four years.



Part 2 Better Compensation for War Widows

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The War Widows Income Support Supplement - frozen since 1986  - will be indexed to increases in Male Total Average Weekly  Earnings (MTAWE) or the Consumer Price Index (CPI), whichever  is greater.  The ‘un-freezing’ of the ISS will cost $70.3 million over  three years.



Part 3 Reviewing the Access to Veterans’ Entitlements

Ã¢ÂÂ¢  A third Howard Government will conduct a high profile and  independent review to consider anomalies within the eligibility  criteria for Veterans’ entitlements of certain servicemen and  women.  This review will include an examination of qualifying  service and the guidelines for granting a Veterans’ Affairs Service  Pension.

Labor’s Alternative

In 1996, Labor left behind a system of Veterans’ benefits with many  anomalies and injustices.

Labor largely neglected Veterans and War Widows living in regional,  rural and remote areas, although they account for 30% of the total  Veteran population.

Labor also ignored the health problems of Vietnam, Korea and Gulf  War Veterans and those service personnel and civilians who  participated in the British atomic tests.

Labor has attempted to weaken the principles underpinning the  Repatriation system with a proposal to extend the provisions of the  Veteran Entitlement Act to civilian groups.

Labor has wavered in its support for maintaining the Australian Flag,  keeping Anzac Day separate from Australia Day and retaining a  separate Department of Veterans’ Affairs to meet the specific needs of  the ex-service community.

Labor has attempted to politicise the Honours and Awards system by  bringing forward legislation for retrospective bravery awards.

Highlights of the Government’s Achievements

The Coalition Government is strongly committed to providing generous  support, care and compensation to Australian Veterans and War  Widows through a simple, fair and responsive Repatriation system.

Since coming to government in 1996, the Coalition has increased the  Veterans’ Affairs budget by 37%, from $6.2 billion to $8.7 billion.

The Coalition believes firmly that the sacrifice and service of our  Veterans should always be acknowledged by a proud and grateful  Australian community.  Younger Australians in particular should be  encouraged to learn about and commemorate the sacrifices made by  those older Australians who secured for future generations the  freedoms we enjoy today.

That’s why, since 1996, the Coalition has improved the compensation,  health care and commemoration of our Veterans.



Compensation

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The Gold Card has been extended to provide comprehensive free  health coverage to more than 38,000 Australian Veterans aged over  70 with World War II qualifying service.



Ã¢ÂÂ¢ A $32.3 million package of support for Vietnam Veterans and their  families has been delivered, addressing the validated findings of the  Vietnam Veterans’ Health Study.  This builds on the extensive  range of benefits, treatment and counselling services already  available to Veterans and their dependants through the Department  of Veterans’ Affairs and the Vietnam Veterans Counselling Service.



Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The Coalition Government provided a $25,000 tax free cash  payment to Australian service personnel and civilians held prisoner  by Japan during World War II, and to their surviving Widows.



Ã¢ÂÂ¢ We have addressed anomalies in Repatriation benefits and  medals for Australian Defence Force personnel who served in  South-East Asia between 1955 and 1975, and extended full  Repatriation benefits to an additional 2,600 Veterans.



Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The Coalition Government legislated to link the service and war  widow’s pensions to 25% of Male Total Average Weekly Earnings  when Consumer Price Index increases fail to maintain that  benchmark.  This ensures that the Veteran community benefits from  improved standards of living.



Ã¢ÂÂ¢ We restored the pension rights of thousands of War Widows who  had their pensions cancelled when they chose to remarry.



Veterans’ Affairs   5

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Interest rates on Defence Service home loans were reduced to a  rate that is 1.5 percentage points below the average market rate.   This rate will never exceed 6.85% to provide both savings and  security.



Ã¢ÂÂ¢ We established more than 70 offices or agencies in rural and  regional locations, expanded health services in rural areas and  provided more mental health counsellors.

Health Care

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The Coalition Government introduced the Veterans’ Home Care  program - designed to reduce the need for hospitalisation and other  medical services by providing a range of home services to improve  the general health of Veterans and War Widows who want to  continue living in their own homes.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ We extended the Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme  to up to 47,000 British, Commonwealth and Allied (BCAL) Veterans  who  are aged 70 or over, have qualifying service from WWII and  have lived in Australia for 10 years or more.  Under this initiative,  eligible BCAL Veterans can also claim the DVA Pharmaceutical  Allowance.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Veteran partnering with private hospitals was introduced to  provide Veterans with a wider choice of hospital care at locations  convenient to them.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The Coalition Government is undertaking a comprehensive study of  the health of Australian Veterans of the Gulf War.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ We released the long overdue nominal roll of Australian Veterans of  the Korean War and commissioned a mortality study and a cancer  incidence study of Korean War Veterans.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The Residential Care Development Scheme has been  established to assist ex-service organisations and community-based providers seeking to deliver high quality aged care services  to members of the Veteran community.



Commemoration

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ $6 million has been allocated to construct a major new memorial in  London, commemorating the service of Australians in the two world  wars.  The new memorial a t Hyde Park Corner should be completed  by Anzac Day 2003 and will be the focal point for Anzac Day  services in London.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The Coalition Government funded the $5 million documentary  series Australians at War, which was broadcast on ABC Television  from Anzac Day 2001.  The eight episode series is the most  comprehensive visual record made of Australia’s wartime history,  exploring how our experience of war has helped to shape the





6  Supporting Those Who Served

nation.  It will provide a valuable educational tool for all Australian  students.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ $1.2 million was provided for the new Anzac Commemorative Site  at Gallipoli, dedicated on Anzac Day 2000 in the Gallipoli  International Peace Park.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The highly successful Their Service - Our Heritage   commemorative program was introduced.  The program has  supported a range of initiatives and projects in local communities  around the country, leading to growing interest in, and a better  understanding of Australia’s wartime heritage and the service and  sacrifice of its Veterans.  The 2000 Federal Budget provided $17.2  million to extend Their Service - Our Heritage for a further four  years.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ More than $700,000 has been contributed towards the construction  and dedication of the Australian National Korean War Memorial,  unveiled in April 2000.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ $600,000 was allocated to the construction of the Australian  Service Nurses National Memorial, unveiled in October 1999.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The Coalition Government provided $5 million through the  Centenary of Federation fund for a new development at the Shrine  of Remembrance in Melbourne.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ $11.9 million in Centenary of Federation funding was provided for  the construction of ANZAC Hall at the Australian War Memorial.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ $5.1 million has been spent to establish a nominal roll of almost one  million Australians who served during World War II.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Australian memorials have been erected at the significant  battlefields of Rethymno, Crete, and Fromelles and Le Hamel in  France.  A museum and information centre at Sandakan in  Malaysia has been established to commemorate the Australian and  Allied PoWs who suffered and died in the Sandakan-Ranau death  march during WWII.  The Prime Minister opened a memorial  museum at Hellfire Pass, Thailand.

The Way Forward:



Part 1 Better Health Care for our Veterans

Extension of the Gold Card to Australian Veterans over

70 Years of Age with Qualifying Service

The Gold Card provides health care, including travel assistance, for all  conditions irrespective of whether they are service-related or not.

The Coalition will extend the Gold Card to all Australian Veterans who  have reached the age of 70 and have qualifying service, at a cost of  $73.5 million over four years.

The Coalition believes this is an important commitment to those  Veterans who served in conflicts after World War II and were exposed  to the unique hardships and deprivations of combat.

The Gold Card was last extended by the Coalition Government in  1998, when it was given to 38,000 Veterans aged over 70 with World  War II qualifying service.  Other holders of the Gold Card include all ex-POWs, Veterans on high levels of disability pension (from injuries  sustained during their military service), and all World War One  Veterans.



Part 2  Better Compensation for War Widows



Improving Benefits for War Widows: Unfreezing the  Income Support Supplement (ISS)



In 1986, Labor decided to ‘freeze’ the income and assets tested  income support supplement paid to War Widows.  Since then, the ISS  ceiling has remained frozen at $124.90 per fortnight for the 85,000 War  Widows receiving income support.

The Coalition Government will reverse Labor’s unfair decision and  introduce twice yearly indexation of the ISS to increases in Male Total  Average Weekly Earnings or the Consumer Price Index, whichever is  greater.

The ‘un-freezing’ of the ISS will cost $70.3 million over four years and  will ensure that income support supplement payments for War Widows  keep pace with improvements in community standards of living.

Part 3 Reviewing the Access to Veterans’

Entitlements



An Independent Review into Eligibility for Veterans’

Benefits



The Coalition Government is concerned that some groups of ex-Servicemen and women may have a claim to entitlements under the  Veterans’ Entitlement Act but are currently denied access to these  generous benefits (including service pension and the Gold Card)  because of perceived anomalies in the definition of qualifying service.

These groups could include some World War II Veterans without  qualifying service, Veterans of the British Occupational Force of Japan,  participants of British atomic testing in Australia and servicemen  engaged in counter terrorist and special recovery training.

A third Howard Government will conduct a high profile and independent  review to consider anomalies within the eligibility criteria for Veterans  entitlements.  This review will be cond ucted in close consultation with  the ex-service community and will include an analysis of qualifying  service provisions and access to the Veterans’ Affairs Service Pension.
