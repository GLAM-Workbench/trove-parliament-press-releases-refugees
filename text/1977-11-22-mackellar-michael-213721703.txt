MINISTER COMMENTS ON WATERSIDER'S ACTION ON REFUGEES

The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Mr M.J.R.

MacKellar^ said today that he had been advised about a motion passed by .  '

the Darwin Branch of the Waterside Workers' Federation.

The Federation had decided to stop work for two hours on

each shift to highlight the illegal entry of alleged Vietnamese into

Australia.

.  The Minister said that he understood the Waterside Workers'

Federation was concerned about the adequacy of Australian defences and

possible flaws in the quarantine operation and that the Federation did not believe

that these immigrants were refugees some 2\ years after the Vietnam War had

ended.

Mr MacKellar said the Waterside Workers' Federation was also

protesting about the extra burden on social services which the boat people

caused and the possibility that they would compete for jobs.

Mr MacKellar said, he well understood that there could be

differing views held about the movement of refugees into Australia by

these means. '

The small boats did strain the available surveillance resources

but he was satisfied that up to the present time immigration and quarantine

control actions had been effective. .

There was no question that a rising flow of small boat migration

would require a continuing review and tightening of the surveillance procedures.

But, at the same time, there was no doubt about Australia's

obligation to deal in the most sympathetic terms with people who, to the

best of the ability to determine the facts,were genuine refugees.

The Minister said that it would be regrettable, and indeed

deplorable, if obstacles were placed in the way of giving.humanitarian .

treatment to these people in need, as was now being suggested by the

Waterside Workers' Federation.
