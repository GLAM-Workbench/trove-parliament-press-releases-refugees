JULIA GILLARD’S FAILED MALAYSIAN PEOPLE SWAP

The Coalition will consider any legislation put forward by the Government in relation  to offshore processing.

However, today Julia Gillard has not come up with a better policy. She has come up  with a legislative excuse to implement an already failed and flawed policy.

The Malaysian people swap is a proven policy failure. Nauru is a proven policy  success.

Since the agreement with Malaysia was announced earlier this year, almost 1,000 boat  people have arrived and, since it was signed, 400 people have arrived.

When Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard unpicked the Howard Government’s border  protection policies, they put the people smugglers back in business.

The people smugglers only have a “business model” because Kevin Rudd and Julia  Gillard gave them one.

If the Prime Minister is serious about stopping the boats she will put an end to her  political stubbornness and she will pick up the phone to the President of Nauru.

Only the combination of Nauru, the re-introduction of temporary protection visas and  a willingness to turn boats around where it is safe to do so will stop the boats.

Malaysia is not offshore processing; Malaysia is offshore dumping.

Julia Gillard is once again breaking her pre-election promise not to send boat people  to a country that hasn’t signed the Refugee Convention. (“I would rule out anywhere  that is not a signatory to the Refugee Convention.” Julia Gillard, Radio 6PR,  8/7/2010)

The Coalition looks forward to a comprehensive briefing from the Government on its  planned changes to section 198A of the Migration Act. Any legislation that comes  forward will be considered in the usual way.
