NEW ETHNIC ORGANISATIONS DIRECTORY LAUNCHED

The latest edition of a Government directory giving details  of ethnic community organisations throughout Australia, has  been released by the Minister for Immigration, Local ,   Government and Ethnic Affairs, Senator Robert Ray.

The updated Directory of Ethnic Community Organisations in  Australia. 1989 gives details of some 2700 organisations  representing more than 130 national,  ethnic, and religious  groups.  Â·

Senator Ray said stocks of the previous edition had run out  quickly and there had been considerable demand for a new  edition. .  Â·  .

He said the revised Directory would be useful to both newly  arrived and well-established ethnic communities.  .

It would also be a help to those providing services to. and  working with migrants and refugees,  including government,  academic and private organisations.  ,  ,

Senator Ray said the Directory was a good advertisement for  the valuable work undertaken in the community by ethnic  groups and their representatives. Â·  .

It included such details as addresses,  names of contact Â·   officers and women's representatives.  It also listed the  major activities of each organisation and gave information  about newsletters and other publications put out by them.

The 1989 Directory will be sent free of charge to all  organisations listed. Copies may also be bought from  Commonwealth bookshops. .  .
