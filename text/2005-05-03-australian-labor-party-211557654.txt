Speech to the Australia-Papua New Guinea Business  Forum, 3 May, Cairns   By  Bob Sercombe MP, Shadow Minister for Pacific Islands



Australia and Papua New Guinea:  Can we forge a 21st century partnership?  3 May 2005

Introduction

[Thank you to the organisers]

I’ve just returned from two weeks travelling across Papua New Guinea. You can’t spend  any amount of time in PNG without being simultaneously aware of the great challenges,  and the great opportunities facing the country.

If we were to look thirty years hence, will Papua New Guinea’s population have been  devastated by HIV/AIDs?

Or will Papua New Guinea be a Pacific powerhouse, having harnessed its resource  potential to ensure economic opportunities for a large population?

I’ve come away convinced that Australia and Papua New Guinea need a new, 21st  century partnership.

A new partnership to tackle challenges like HIV/AIDs, sustainable economic  development and the preservation of environmental integrity.

A new partnership, so we can together lead the Pacific to embrace 21st century  opportunities like regional integration.





Challenges

The challenges in Papua New Guinea are familiar to all of us.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Developing a nation from such diversity.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The invisibility of the state in many rural areas.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The ongoing urban drift.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The need to lift employment levels in the formal economy.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The need to promote environmental sustainability, particularly in the forestry  industry.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ And the great threat looming on the horizon, of a HIV/AIDs epidemic to rival  sub-Saharan Africa.

According to a recent AusAID study, by 2020 measures of economic welfare in PNG  could fall by between 12 and 48% due to HIV/AIDs. The labour force could be 13 to  28% lower, and the budget deficit could increase by 9 to 21%.

The high rates of tuberculosis and malaria are also critical health challenges.

The recent Australian Strategic Policy Institute’s report on Papua New Guinea suggested  that PNG was one of Australia’s three top foreign policy priorities, along with US-China  relations and Indonesia.

You wouldn’t think this was the case from Australia’s current policy settings, and from  Australian interest in Papua New Guinea. We’ve all got a problem when the main story in  the bilateral relationship is Brisbane airport’s security procedures.



The idea that Australia could somehow remain immune from an economic collapse in  Papua New Guinea, or an HIV/AIDs epidemic, is nonsense.

In 2003, Trevor Kennedy, the former chair of Oil Search, put it this way:  “There are an estimated 5.2 million people in PNG… What do you do  if half a million of them… turn up in their canoes on Cape York  Peninsula? A bit more preventative medicine is worth thinking about.”

Given the government’s attitude to boat people, we better start working on this  preventative medicine now.

These are the challenges.

But we have a great opportunity before us.

In the space of a generation, so many countries in East Asia have been lifted out of  poverty. It took the right government policies, it took good business people, it took hard  work, but it is possible.



Papua New Guinea has the resources, and the people, to make it happen too.

ASPI puts it in these terms:  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ in thirty years time, Papua New Guinea could be a middle-income country with a  GNI per capita of, say, US$1,920 per year, in today’s terms

o this compares to its current GNI per capita of US$510 per year  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ It could be a clear asset as a partner in regional stability  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ It could be a profitable field for trade and investment  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ And it could be a place Australians and others would love to visit - and having

just been there, I can testify to its tourism potential.

It’s been thirty years since Papua New Guinea’s independence. But recent events suggest  we’re still carrying the baggage of the colonial and post-colonial period. We need to  leave that mutual burden behind.



We need to forge a 21st century partnership. Our eyes need to be firmly fixed on the  prize, thirty years hence, of a stable, prosperous Papua New Guinea, with far more Papua  New Guineans having broken free from poverty.







A 21st century partnership

The recent ASPI report emphasised that the essential first step in bringing Australia-PNG  relations into the 21st century is, simply, to work on strengthening the bilateral  relationship.

Since I’m addressing an audience of business leaders, let me use some management  lingo, to explain what I see as one of the big problems in the relationship at the moment.

You know yourselves, that the successful companies in the 21st century are the flexible,  adaptable ones.

The companies that are hierarchical and slow-moving, that restrict the flow of  information and ideas, are destined for the scrap-heap.

What does this mean when applied to inter-state relations?

When an airport shoe incident can disrupt the bilateral relationship, the relationship is too  brittle.

We need a model for our bilateral relationship that is more organic, where there is  flexibility and two-way learning.

Labor supports the Enhanced Cooperation Program.

One of the problems at the moment, though, is that the Australian government has  approached this program in a very top-down, hierarchical manner.

I don’t believe this sort of approach works anyway, but there’s an even greater danger of  it failing when you’re the former colonial power.

As a result, the ECP has not maximised its support amongst PNG policy-makers and the  community.

That’s a worry when we’ve committed $800 million.

We need to change the dynamic here.

Let’s get other members of the Pacific Islands Forum involved. If you look at RAMSI,  eleven members of the Forum have been involved at various points. With the ECP, it’s  just us, the former colonial power.



Instead of us just sending Australians to Papua New Guinea, let’s have Papua New  Guinean police and public servants come to Australia and work with our police and  public servants.

This would convey a much better sense of partnership and shared learning, and I believe  it would remove a lot of the current angst about the ECP.

This is what I mean by a more organic approach, where the flow of ideas and people  works both ways.

Currently, we have a PNG Australia Treasury Twinning Scheme (PATTS), which  arranges staff exchanges, but this needs to be much broader.

Let me give another example.

Now, as a loyal AFL supporter, it hurts me a bit to talk about this, but since I’m in  Queensland, I feel I’m playing to the right audience.

Let’s start talking about a Papua New Guinea team in the Australian National Rugby  League.  We could initially look at an interim arrangement, with PNG participating in,  say, the Queensland competition.  But in time we should be aiming to create a real

Australasian competition.

We need to think creatively - anything we can do to improve the sense of national  identity amongst Papua New Guineans is worth pursuing.

More aid isn’t necessarily the answer in Papua New Guinea.

But smarter aid is definitely part of the answer. I suggest to you that developing much  better people-to-people links will do far more to improve the bilateral relationship, and to  improve Papua New Guinea’s development prospects, than bucketloads of extra aid  money.



These are the sorts of issues we need to be thinking about at a government-to-government  level. But governments, as you know, can only do so much. Ultimately, it is business that  will be the engine of economic growth in Papua New Guinea.



The PNG Gas Project is an exciting opportunity, and one which I fully support.

It has the potential to create thousands of jobs in Papua New Guinea through direct and  flow-on employment, and with potential significant benefits to the energy market in  Australia.

But Papua New Guinea’s challenge is to move beyond just relying on mining and  resource projects for its national revenue.

The revenue that the PNG Gas Project will bring will ease fiscal pressures and allow the  national government to invest more in infrastructure.

But no one project can address the challenges facing a country.

The drivers of economic growth need to be more broad-based.

We need to see thousands more successful small to medium sized enterprises in Papua  New Guinea.

We need to think about how small companies can contribute to development in rural  areas, where 85% of Papua New Guinea’s population live.

We need a combination of government investment in rural infrastructure, and small  companies fuelling rural development, if we are to reduce the pressures contributing to  urban drift.

This is why a gathering such as this is so encouraging, particularly if it can serve as a  catalyst for the contacts, and the plans, needed to ensure economic growth in Papua New  Guinea becomes much more broadly based.





Shared leadership in regional integration

Many other regions around the world are pursuing regional integration, to realise  common solutions to common challenges.

The European Union is the most obvious example. Whatever its flaws in its agricultural  policies, the way it has worked with the countries of Central and Eastern Europe over the  last ten years to entrench democracy, economic development and security, is to be

commended.



There are some encouraging signs that the Pacific might be finally ready to pursue  regional integration.

In 2003, a bipartisan parliamentary committee released an important report, A Pacific  Engaged: Australia’s relations with Papua New Guinea and the island states of the  south-west Pacific.

The Committee’s key recommendation was that the idea of a Pacific Economic and  Political Community was worthy of further research, analysis and debate.

The Committee envisaged that such a Community would, over time, result in close  economic and institutional integration.

I have been encouraged by the Papua New Guinean reaction to this report.

In the last week, I have had extensive discussions with Ian Ling-Stuckey, the Governor of  New Ireland.

Ian is chairing a Parliamentary Committee into ‘A Pacific Economic Community’, to  investigate what the issues and opportunities of regional integration might be from the  PNG perspective.

And, as you know, all members of the Pacific Islands Forum are currently developing the  Pacific Plan, exploring what government functions could be managed on a regional basis.

The rewards of regional integration would be great, but I am not going to pretend the  journey would be an easy one.

If Papua New Guinea did get to the point where it seriously wanted to explore using the  Australian dollar, we would have to talk carefully about the sort of fiscal discipline this  might involve.



But we could be supportive of such a step - for instance, by sharing some of the  seigniorage, the money that Australia makes from the use of its currency, with a country  that was prepared to use the Australian dollar.

As you can appreciate, too, the idea of Pacific workers coming to Australia on short term  visas presents various issues.  Any arrangement would have to protect the job  opportunities and working conditions of Australians - as well as protecting the working  conditions of Pacific Islanders in Australia.  Any scheme should include skills

development for Pacific workers.

In the last couple of weeks, I have been disappointed that Amanda Vanstone hasn’t been  prepared to even start talking about how a trial could work, and the issues that might be  involved.



Instead, she has extended the working holiday visa program.

According to Senator Vanstone, some 100 000 working holiday visas have been granted  in 2004-2005 - and she is now proposing to extend this scheme.

The government would obviously prefer to keep inviting backpackers from rich European  and North American countries.

I believe the exclusion of Pacific states from the phenomenon of regional integration  around the world, including in the wider Asia-Pacific, is a key 21st century challenge.

But, if Australia and Papua New Guinea are prepared to demonstrate shared leadership, it  could also serve as a tremendous opportunity. But shared leadership means shared  responsibility, and we must both be prepared to seize this opportunity.







Conclusion

There’s no doubt that there are challenges in Papua New Guinea, and challenges in our  relationship.

But, every now and again, you get hints of the tremendous potential in our partnership  when we get it right.

If you’d said to a Bougainvillean a number of years ago, your national authorities and  Australia will be working together to assist you in bringing peace to your island, they  may well have been extremely sceptical.

And now look where we are. Alongside Bougainvilleans’ own courageous efforts, we  have worked together to assist the Bougainville peace process. Peaceful elections for an  autonomous local government are occurring. Bougainville’s development prospects are  improving.

That’s what we’re capable of when we work together.

Australia has legitimate security interests in Papua New Guinea. But a genuine  partnership can’t just be based on fear of security threats.

Both governments need to be talking much more about how we can bring hope to the  many Papua New Guineans who are currently without it.

We should be aiming to be a model for the rest of the world, of how a developed and  developing country can work together to reduce poverty.

You hear a lot about three-year plans, five-year plans and exit strategies in our  relationship with Papua New Guinea.

When two neighbours are only a few kilometres apart at their closest point, it’s useless to  be talking about exit strategies.

Our 21st century partnership should be guided by a long-term strategic vision.

It’s been thirty years since independence.

Let’s start working together on where we want to be in another thirty years time.

Thank you.
