The Hon Peter Garrett MP [link:/garrett]

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Minister for School Education Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Minister for Early Childhood and Youth

ISSUES:   Labor leadership

PETER VAN ONSELEN:  Welcome back.  You're watching Australian Agenda in this 90  minute extended edition to cover the Labor leadership crisis and we're joined now by  School Education Minister Peter Garrett.  Mr Garrett thanks for your company.

PETER GARRETT: Good morning.

PETER VAN ONSELEN: I should say right off the bat that we had a whole education  special lined up at the start of this week before the leadership crisis broke out.

PETER GARRETT: You did Peter.  That's good.

PETER VAN ONSELEN: We were planning to talk about the Gonski Report.  Have  yourself on and Christopher Pyne later in the program.  You've very kindly kept your word  of being here despite that.  So I just wanted - I think the viewers deserve to know that.

First question on the leadership crisis.  I just want to play you some footage that Julia  Gillard said during the week about Kevin Rudd and get your reaction.

JULIA GILLARD: What Kevin obviously struggled to do when times were a little bit  politically tough, particularly in 2010, was to run a government with any sort of method or  purpose or discipline or internal process's ability to get things done.  That's what I have  sought to rectify as Prime Minister.

PETER VAN ONSELEN: In a word, do you agree with you that?

PETER GARRETT: Look, the Prime Minister is laying out very clearly what the  circumstances were when the caucus made a decision that she should be both the leader of  the parliamentary party and the Prime Minister and in doing that, she's reflecting both on  what happened at the time and subsequently what has been on the record. So of course I  do.

I think that by the time that Mr Rudd's Prime Ministership was reaching its latter stages, it  was clear to both the Deputy Prime Minister and to others that the order and function and  purpose that are the necessary constituents of stable government, weren't being expressed

in a way which was giving people the confidence that they needed to do the job that they  had to do and the caucus made the call on that accordingly.

PETER VAN ONSELEN: It's concerning then though, isn't it, that somebody that's so  dysfunctional, particularly at that pointy end of things, the end of his Prime Ministership,  would then be put in charge of Australia's foreign policy.

PETER GARRETT: Well I think the thing is that both Mr Rudd and Prime Minister  Gillard are people of considerable ability and they've exercised their abilities in the roles  that they’ve had and, you know…

PETER VAN ONSELEN: But you say considerable ability. But the words that we just saw  then, not to mention Wayne Swan and others, suggests otherwise or perhaps considerable  ability in theory but not in practice. In practice, dysfunction.

PETER GARRETT: Well, you know, you don't ever really know until you get into the  business of Government, how you're going to proceed. I think the fact of the matter is that  the caucus took a view and it gets the opportunity to take the view again this Monday on  who is best placed to provide the leadership necessary to implement the reforms that we  have underway, and that's where we are at this point in time. It's absolutely critical for us  not to sort of rehash every aspect of what's really on the public record. But recognise we've  got an opportunity as a party to make a decision and then to move forward.

PAUL KELLY: But Minister, given what you've just said about the caucus lack of  confidence in Kevin Rudd before, could you, as a minister, work under Kevin Rudd as  Prime Minister?

PETER GARRETT: Well, that's a hypothetical Paul.

PAUL KELLY: No, it's not.  It is a very relevant question.  You've just said that the party  had no confidence in Kevin Rudd before.  So I ask, as a senior minister, can you work  under Kevin Rudd?

PETER GARRETT: Well Paul, if Mr Rudd were to prevail on Monday, I wouldn't seek to  serve in his ministry, even if he chose to ask me.

PAUL KELLY: Okay.  Now why is that?

PETER GARRETT: Because I believe that Prime Minister Gillard is the best person to  lead the party. I'm supporting Prime Minister Gillard.   spent my time as a loyal and  disciplined minister in the first term of the Labor Government and I did the job that was  required of me.  I now believe very clearly that Prime Minister Gillard is the best placed  person, not only to lead the party, but to be Prime Minister of the country.

PAUL KELLY:  I understand the point you are making. I understand the point you're  making about Prime Minister Gillard.  But what you've said is that you would not serve  under Kevin Rudd. Why wouldn't you?

PETER GARRETT: Paul, I don't believe that I need to say much more than I've already  said to you this morning. I think that there has been significant amount of debate about the  latter terms of Kevin's Prime Ministership. I think at that period of time I displayed all of

the disciplines and loyalties that a senior minister should. Now, you've asked me the  question and I've answered you truthfully. I think it's a hypothetical question, but I've  answered it truthfully. I don't propose to say any more.

PAUL KELLY:  Do you think as Prime Minister that Kevin Rudd was disloyal to you?

PETER GARRETT: Well again, I’m not going to start re-going into what may or may not  be conjecture.

PAUL KELLY: [Interrupts] it’s a critical question.  Do you think he was disloyal to you?

PETER GARRETT: Well, what I would say is this. I discharged my responsibilities,  loyally and with discipline. I have an expectation Paul, and I think everybody in the  Ministry and the caucus does, that for you to be able to govern effectively, you do need to

be able to secure the discipline necessary to do that over time. Now, I've done that. I'll  continue to do that. I'll be clear as to what I think we need to do as a Government and I  think that's the most important thing that I can say at this point in time.

DENNIS SHANAHAN: Mr Garrett. You've received a lot of criticism over the roofing  insulation scheme. Isn't it the case that your department and you, as part of your exercise of  discipline and loyalty, warned the Prime Minister's department of the difficulties,  impending difficulties, with the roofing insulation scheme? We've seen a report released  publicly this week which said it could have been prevented. Isn't it the case that you did in  fact warn Mr Rudd about the difficulties with the roofing insulation scheme?

PETER GARRETT: Well, the letters that were written by me to the Prime Minister are on  the public record Dennis and through all of that period, I always believed that I had acted  absolutely properly as a Minister. I continued to discharge my responsibilities. The Prime  Minister at the time, Mr Rudd, saw fit to give me a partial demotion. He made that  decision. I accepted that decision, as I think a minister should and I continued to work in a  collegiate and collaborative fashion with ministers, as I do to this day. Those matters are  on the record. My response is on the record.

But what I think's important now is to recognise that in politics there are any manner of  interactions, both within a ministry and between a Prime Minister and Ministers. What's  crucial is that Ministers have the confidence that the Prime Minister is the right person to  lead them to do the job that we're all here to do and in that case, what I've said previously,  and what I'm saying today as well, is that I think Prime Minister Gillard is the right person  for that job.

DENNIS SHANAHAN: What you've said though is - and quite correctly - that your letters  are on the public record. But isn't there material which is not on the public record, which  backs your position and which vindicates your position as being both a loyal and  disciplined minister and isn't that part of why you feel that you cannot serve in a Kevin  Rudd cabinet?

PETER GARRETT: Well Dennis, what I think is this. There are a number of matters on  the public record there. There was a senate enquiry. There was evidence given by officials  and the like. But really the question here is who you think is the best person to continue the

leadership of the Labor Party and the Government? Now, the caucus had the opportunity to  make that decision and they chose Julia Gillard to do that job. I supported that view. When  it was put to me at the time, if there was going to be a spill, who would I support? I said  immediately I would support the Deputy Prime Minister if she was a contender.

Now, she's taken that role. I think she's done a very good job under pretty difficult  circumstances and I actually think that she has the capacity and ability to secure not only  the confidence of the caucus, but the country as well in the job that we have to do.

PETER VAN ONSELEN: But Mr Garrett the reason why you took that decision then and  are now continuing to stand by Julia Gillard over Kevin Rudd, I think is a really important  and a really interesting one. Do you think that his dysfunction, former Prime Minister  Kevin Rudd's dysfunction and his office's dysfunction, contributed to some of the  problems that you faced as a minister trying to act responsibly in relation to pink batts?

PETER GARRETT: Well Peter, what I would say is this. I think that there's a high bar of  loyalty that goes with the exercise of power and responsibility in a political party and then  a Government and I think people can make their judgements about whether that high bar of

loyalty has been reached in the circumstances that you've addressed. For my purposes, I  exercised the loyalty that I thought was necessary.

I'll let the commentators take a view about other matters, because I agree with my  colleague Chris Bowen. We've got two contenders, two people who are basically putting  up their hand on Monday morning to be judged worthy of leading the Labor Party. I know  who I'm going to be supporting and I know why. But I’m not going to spend a lot of time  rehashing ancient history, because I believe we've got a job to do for the Australian people  in the future.

PETER VAN ONSELEN: But be that as it may though, the reality is, I think, isn't it, that  whilst you exercised that loyalty at the time to Kevin Rudd, he didn't give it back to you?

PETER GARRETT: Well, I'm very aware of the circumstances of what took place then.  I'm not seeking to elevate them around this question of the leadership, because I think that  both the Prime Minister and Mr Rudd have had ample opportunity to both lay out what  they think their future vision is for the party and the country and also to be assessed by the  actions  that have happened in the past and what they want to do in the future.

PETER VAN ONSELEN: It's an interesting decision though. I mean if you step back from  it and we don't talk about pink batts. But we look specifically at why you're backing Julia  Gillard over Kevin Rudd. Kevin Rudd is talking - or at least a large body of his supporters  are taking a different view to Julia Gillard on things like asylum seekers. The Labor left,  for example. Now, you've got strong views on this. You talked about them at the Labor  National Conference. But you are nonetheless sticking with Julia Gillard, even though  some of the decisions that she takes are perhaps a little bit too conservative for your liking.

Now, it strikes me calling a spade a spade, that you're doing that because you just have a  straight up problem with Kevin Rudd as Prime Minister.

PETER GARRETT: Well Peter, you've used the perhaps there. I'll just let that drift over  my right shoulder. Here's the point though and let's move onto something else, even  around this issue. I showed and displayed the appropriate loyalties that a Minister should  in the Government and I supported Prime Minister Rudd through those decision making  processes, whatever they may have been. When the opportunity arose for a spilled position  to lead the Labor Party, I made the decision the on basis of who I thought the best person  to lead the party was.

Now, I've worked closely with both people. I understand, as we all do in politics, our  respective qualities. What I would say is this. No one doubts the fact that people have got  strong motivations to lead political parties. No-one doubts that for a second. The question  is how do they exercise the judgement? How do they exercise the leadership and what are  the fruits of that exercise of leadership?

Now, I think we can see, after a pretty difficult week, what some of those issues really  reflect around and for me, what's absolutely vital is to settle this issue for once and for all,  to unite, to show the discipline that's necessary when you're in Government with the  responsibilities that go with it, and lay out that agenda and attack Tony Abbott on a range  of issues including their economic competency.

DENNIS SHANAHAN: Mr Garrett, just on a final point, you have indicated that you can't  work with Kevin Rudd. Do you think at the time when loyalty clearly wasn't exercised for  you, that you should have resigned at the time?

PETER GARRETT: No I don't Dennis, because I thought that I'd behaved and acted  absolutely appropriately as a Minister. I believe events have completely borne that out over  time and you know what, I get an opportunity that very few people get, to be in the

parliament, to serve in the Ministry, to serve the party and the Government. I take that very  seriously. I always have. Now, I take it seriously now as School Education Minister. I want  to do the best job I can and I think most people in my case would be the same.

PETER VAN ONSELEN: Peter Garrett, one final question before we let you go and I'd  like to move past the politics of the leadership contest and really just get an honest answer  from you about this. You're not a Labor insider. You came to politics with your own  reputation, your own career, a significant one at that. You've lived through in your time in  politics the Mark Latham debacle. You've now seen all of these problems with the back  and forth between Gillard and Kevin Rudd. Do you have any regrets choosing this course,  given what you've seen on the inside with the Labor Party?

PETER GARRETT: Peter, I don't. I think the fact that we have got such a big agenda in  education out there and I'm a part of that is fantastic.  Some of the things that we were able  to do when I had the environment portfolio I hope will be seen in time to have been  positive for the country. You know, I think about someone like Kim Beazley. A great  Labor leader who didn't achieve what I think was within his grasp and certainly within his  ability, to be a Prime Minister in time. Mr Beazley chose, after those disappointments, to  go to the back bench. He chose to mentor young MPs. He chose to give the parliament the

benefit of his deep knowledge about foreign policy issues and defence issues and he  continued to make a real contribution and, you know, I take some solace and some comfort  from that and I hope my colleagues do as well.

PETER VAN ONSELEN: Well, I'm going to ask one more follow up then, which I'm sure  you won't mind, which is education. In terms of the decision to stay in the game of politics  as a Minister, despite some of these internal ructions that you probably didn't sign up for.  The Gonski Report, it was out at the start of the week. It was what we were going to be  talking about in this interview. How important is it to you to see the Government adopt  significant policy from that so that in your time in politics whatever happens at the next  election, win or lose, you'll have implemented something that you feel you're proud, of  that's an important policy in an important policy area?

PETER GARRETT: Well mate, I don't know whether that's a free kick or a hospital pass.  But what I would say is this. We've got to get education right in the country. We've  provided significant additional support, both in spending and, you know, national

curriculum, the BER. But what Mr Gonski's recommendations have shown us is that we  need to do it much better and I think our future prospects as a nation are entirely tied to  doing that. A high skilled workforce. People with the capacity, not only to fulfil  themselves, but also to help the country.  So I'm very much looking forward to doing that  work and I know it'll be led by Prime Minister Gillard. I very much hope that's the case  and I think it can make a big difference to the country.

PETER VAN ONSELEN: Alright.  Peter Garrett we appreciate you joining us on  Australian Agenda.  Thanks for your company.

PETER GARRETT: Thanks Peter.
