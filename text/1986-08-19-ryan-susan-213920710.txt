NEW STUDENT ASSISTANCE ARRANGEMENTS

AUSTUDY ANNOUNCED

<

W

W

The Minister for Education said tonight that, with the introduction of

AUSTUDY, the Government was realising one of the key elements of its Priority

One strategy for young people.

AUSTUDY is the name for the new allowance arrangements to be introduced in

1987_for students aged 16 and over engaged in full-time secondary or tertiary

study. Under AUSTUDY, age-related allowances will replace the current

assistance schemes for students on TEAS, ASEAS and SAS, which are based on the

type of institution attended. '

"In 1987, most categories of eligible students will see immediate benefits

from AUSTUDY through increased allowances," Senator Ryan said. "This is in

keeping with the Government's commitment last year that education allowances

will be progressively aligned with unemployment benefits. By 1989 the process

of alignment will be complete. ,

w

"The significant increases in allowances being implemented by the Government

provide.a much stronger incentive for young people to study and secure

qualifications which will help them find and keep employment.

"The scheme with its much improved allowances for students will remove the

disincentive to study which arose from the fact that the unemployment benefit

outstripped the basic rates of education allowances for young people. This

was a legacy of the years of Liberal Government from 1975 to 1983."

Senator Ryan emphasised that, once the scheme is in place, education

allowances will be indexed.

/

M134/86 2 .

"The Government has given a commitment that, from 1989 when the new structure

is fully in place, both allowances and income test levels will be indexed to

ensure the real value of benefits is not eroded.

"That indexation has been sought for many years by student organisations and

parents."

For 1987, income test levels will be increased by 5 per cent.

In addition, AUSTUDY for higher education students in 1987 will include a

special payment of $250 to cover the new administration charge for higher

education courses. Â·

The needs of special groups have also been reviewed. Country families, in

particular, will benefit from changes to the Assistance for Isolated Children

(AIC) scheme to make it more consistent with provisions of the AUSTUDY scheme.

Senator Ryan said that, in line with the Government's wish to encourage

children from rural areas to complete secondary education, the most

substantial increase in benefits will go to isolated students aged 16 and

over. They will now qualify for the same benefit as those receiving AUSTUDY.

As well, the income test level for AIC allowances has been increased by a

substantial 15.6 per cent on the 1986 levels to bring it into line with that

applying to AUSTUDY.

The Young Homeless Allowance introduced on 1 July 1986 will continue,

reflecting the Government's special concern that young people unable to live

at home because of exceptional circumstances such as domestic violence should

be allowed to continue their studies.

The income provisions for Aboriginal students have also been reviewed. While

Absec and Abstudy will remain as separate schemes, from 1988 their conditions

will be brought more in line with those of AUSTUDY, though with a more

generous income test in recognition of the special needs of Aboriginal people

in education.

Senator Ryan said that, as part of the overriding need for the Government to

reduce expenditure, some aspects of student assistance which did not stand up

to rigorous economic scrutiny have been discontinued. The Government has

decided to remove dual eligibility of pensioners to full education benefits as

well as social security benefits, and to remove from AIC benefits the $120 a

year special allowance for pre-school children studying by correspondence.

Social Security beneficiaries, however, may receive a $15 a week education

allowance.

Full details of the schemes are in attached documents. - *

AUSTUDY: THE NEW ALLOWANCE FOR SECONDARY AND TERTIARY STUDENTS

The major changes announced in the 1985-86 Budget to allowance provisions

for secondary and tertiary students aged 16 years and over will continue

in 1987 with the introduction of the AUSTUDY scheme from the beginning of

the year.

AUSTUDY will replace three former schemes: the Tertiary Education

Assistance Scheme (TEAS), the Adult Secondary Education Assistance Scheme

(ASEAS), and the Secondary Allowances Scheme (SAS).

Expenditure on secondary and tertiary student allowances will be $487.7

million in 1986-87. Under AUSTUDY the number of students assisted is

expected to reach almost 238,000 compared to an estimated 187,000

receiving benefits under SAS, ASEAS and TEAS in 1986.

Major features of the new scheme include:

. provision of allowances to students aged 16 and over undertaking

full-time secondary or tertiary study;

. * progressive alignment of maximum allowance with unemployment

benefit so that by 1989 the relevant rates for young people of the

same age wi11 be equal; '

. indexing of allowances and income test levels once the new

structure is in place to ensure the real value of benefits is not

eroded.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ /2

M134/86 AT.TCH 1 t . 2 .

From 1988 there will be three basic sets of age-related rates of

Commonwealth financial support for young people:

. A common basic rate for 16 and 17 year olds whether in secondary or

tertiary education or unemployed. This rate will be indexed for

movements in the consumer price index. A living away from home

allowance will continue to be payable to eligible 16 and 17 year

old tertiary students, and secondary and tertiary students in that

age group will be able to qualify for independent allowance under

identical conditions. Â·

. A common rate for unemployed 18 to 20 year olds and students aged

18 and over who are independent or, in the case of tertiary

students, who live away from home. The unemployment benefit rate

for 18 to 20 year olds will subsequently be indexed annually and

the student independent/away-from-home rate will be equated with it

. A common rate for secondary students aged 18 and over and for -

tertiary students who live at home will operate from 1989.

Appropriate relativities and the real value for this rate will be

maintained by setting it at 63 per cent of the 18 to 20

unemployment benefit rate from 1988 (see attached table). *

Changes between AUSTUDY and existing schemes include: '

. Increased allowances

- In 1987, every rate of allowance under AUSTUDY will be

increased except for tertiary students aged 16-17 years who are

living away from home or independent who will continue to

receive $73.28 per week. In 1988, there will be further

increases in all rates as part of the move towards consistency

with unemployment benefits.

../3

M134/86 ATTCH 1 . 3 .

Increased income test levels

- The qualifying limits for maximum income-tested benefits under

Ã¢ÂÂ  AUSTUDY will be raised in 1987 by 5 per cent to ensure that

rising income levels do not penalise applicants.

Special supplementary payment

- Higher education students on AUSTUDY allowance will receive a

special payment of $250 to cover the new administration charge

applying to students undertaking higher education courses from

1987. '

- The incidentals allowance of up to $100 a year currently paid

to TEAS and ASEAS students will no longer be available under

AUSTUDY but will be absorbed into living allowance payments.

Dependent child rate

- In 1987, the dependent child rate will increase to $17 a week,

an increase of $1 on the 1986 rate.

'  '  9 Â·  '

Removal of dual eligibility for pension and full student assistance

- The Government has reviewed the relationship between Social

Security pensions and the new AUSTUDY allowances, both of which

have living and child allowance components. As a result of

that review, pensioners will no longer be able to get almost

full student assistance in addition to their pension.

- Instead, sole parent beneficiaries, widow pensioners Class A,

recipients of carer's pension and invalid pensioners may

qualify for a special allowance of $15 a week, free of income

test. The $15 will no.t be treated as income for the purpose of

the Social Security income test.

./4

M134/86 ATTCH 1 . 4 .

- Student pensioners will be exempt from the new administration

charge applying to enrolment in higher education.

- Special arrangements will be made to preserve existing

entitlements for a small number of pensioners who have been

receiving both a pension and an education allowance and who

continue their course in 1987.

Changes to existing conditions

- SAS benefits are currently payable only to students in Years 11

and 12 of secondary school. AUSTUDY will be made available to

all secondary students aged 16 and over.

- Senior secondary students under 16 years willÂ· no longer receive

assistance. A special transitional arrangement for students

assisted under SAS or TEAS in 1986 who are still under 16 at

the beginning of 1987 will enable them to receive AUSTUDY as

long as they are continuing in their secondary or tertiary

course.

- Secondary AUSTUDY payments will become taxable in the hands of i e ht

the recipients (payments to tertiary and adult secondary

students under TEAS and ASEAS are already taxable).

- Secondary AUSTUDY payments will be paid to the student rather

than to a parent. .

- A personal income test for secondary students will apply in the

same way as for tertiary and adult secondary students.

- Payments will be made fortnightly instead of monthly (as in

TEAS and ASEAS) or by term (as in SAS) .

AUSTUDY: RATES AND ELIGIBILITY

Benefits under AUSTUDY will be available to students aged 16 and over

(or, in the case of homeless students, above minimum school leaving age)

undertaking full-time secondary or tertiary study. Students will become

eligible on their 16th birthday, with higher rates becoming payable when

they turn 18.

RATES

The maximum weekly rates of living allowance payable in 1986 and 1987 are

as set out in the following table:

Notes

. Family allowances absorbed into the secondary allowance from 1986.

. Young people without family support are eligible for the independent  rate under the strict conditions of the young homeless provisions.

To be regarded as adult secondary, a student-must have turned 19 by 1  January 1987. Students in this category must meet certain criteria  relating to previous secondary studies.

There will be no separate away-from-home rate under AUSTUDY for  secondary (other than adult secondary) students. Isolated secondary  students needing to live away from home will be assisted under the

Assistance for Isolated Children scheme.

M134/86 A T T C H  2 . 2 .

ELIGIBILITY

“The major thrust of AUSTUDY allowances is towards students from low

income families. Students will, as now under TEAS and SAS, face a

parental income test. This is based on the adjusted family income, which

is gross parental income for the previous financial year less deductions

for other dependent children ($450 each) and for certain business or

property expenses incurred in gaining the income. For 1987, the level of

adjusted family income, up to which maximum allowances are paid will be

relaxed by 5 per cent, from $14,995 to $15,745.

Where income exceeds,$15,745, allowances will taper off gradually. The

rate of taper will be modifed where there are two or more students in a

family in the same sector of the scheme. It will not apply to a

combination of students in both sectors. .

The following tables give an indication of the allowances payable in 1987

at various levels of adjusted family income. .  .

Some students, such as those who are married, are over 25 or have

previously spent a considerable period in the workforce, will be regarded

as independent and will not have to face the parental income test. These

independence provisions previously applied only to tertiary and adult

secondary students under TEAS and ASEAS but they have been extended from

1 July 1986 to general secondary students in SAS as well. They will

apply to both tertiary and secondary students under AUSTUDY.

The criteria for independence will include three new categories brought

in from 1 July 1986. These are homeless students, wards of the

Commonwealth, and refugee students without parents in Australia. The

inclusion of homeless students reflects the Government's special concern

that young people unable to live at home because of exceptional

circumstances such as. domestic violence should not be forced to

discontinue their studies. Strict qualifying criteria are applied to the

grant of independent status on these grounds. Ã¢ÂÂ¢

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ >/4

M134/86 A T T C H  2 . 4 .

Where a student is married, an income test is applied to the income of

the spouse in the previous financial year. The level of spouse income up

to which the maximum benefits are payable will be increased by 5 per cent

from $14,995 to $15,745 for 1987.

Other benefits provided under AUSTUDY are an allowance of $42.70 a week

for a dependent spouse and $17 a week for each dependent child (an

increase of $1 over the 1986 rate). Tertiary and adult secondary

students qualifying for the away-from-home rate of living allowance may

also receive a fares allowance entitling them to up to three return trips

a year between home and place of study. This form, of assistance is not

available to independent students except where they have to live away

from their spouse to undertake their studies.

Ml34/86 ATTACHMENT 3

ASSISTANCE FOR ISOLATED CHILDREN (AIC) SCHEME

The AIC scheme provides financial assistance to the parents of children

who, because of geographic isolation or a disability, must live away from

home to attend school, study by correspondence, or live at a second

family home which provides daily access to schooling.

In 1987, the scheme is to be significantly changed to make it more

consistent with the mainstream provisions of the new AUSTUDY scheme.

Expenditure under the AIC scheme is expected to increase from $22.6

million in 1985-86 to $26.3 million in 1986-87. The number of children

expected to qualify for benefits in 1987 is 21,000.

The essential elements of the new scheme arrangements are as set out

below: .

All eligible boarders

- There will be a guaranteed minimum payment of $989 a year,

regardless of family income. .

- Income test provisions will be substantially relaxed to

bring them into line with those of AUSTUDY. Maximum

allowance will be payable on adjusted family income of

$15,745, a 15.6 per cent increase on the 1986 qualifying

level.

The income levels beyond which only the minimum of $989 will be

payable are shown in the following table:

Boarders aged 16 years and over

Parents of these students will receive the same allowances as

tertiary students living away from home receive under AUSTUDY.

This will mean a maximum of $3,821 ($73.28 a week) for students

aged 16 and 17, and $4,171 ($80 a week) for those aged 18 and

over. '

- These allowances will be subject to the same conditions as

those for AUSTUDY. Entitlements will no longer depend on the

actual level of boarding costs incurred, but will be income

tested on the student's own income, with the benefit being

reduced $1 for every $2 of income exceeding $2,000 a year.

- As for all AUSTUDY students, family allowance payment will be

absorbed into the AIC allowance, which will be taxable in the

hands of the recipient. At the same time, to minimise the risk

of loss of benefits to the family through taxation, the parent

applying for the allowance will have the option of re-directing

payment to the student. .

Boarders aged below 16 years -

- Allowances will rise for those in secondary and primary

school. The maximum payable for secondary students will rise

to $2,607 ($50 a week) unless they are in year 11 or 12, in

which case it will be $2,851 ($54.68 a aweek). For primary

boarders it will be $2,346 ($45 a week).

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ */3

Ml34/86 ATTCH.3 . 3 ..

- Allowances will remain dependent on boarding costs, but the

amount that can be claimed to cover incidental expenses has

been increased from $100 to $250 a year.

Short-term boarders .  '

- There will be a guaranteed minimum payment of $22 a week for

eligible students required to live away from home for short

periods up to a term. However, from 1987 such students will

have access to higher benefits by being able to qualify for the

normal income-tested boarding entitlements for the relevant

period. '

Correspondence students or students living in a second family home

- Those aged 16 or over will no longer be catered for under AIC

provisions but will instead have access to AUSTUDY allowance of

up to $40 a week (aged 16-17) or $45 a week (aged 18 and Â·

over). If the level of family income, however, does not permit

payment of a sufficiently high level of benefit under that

scheme, the parent may instead choose to receive an

income-test-free AIC payment equal to its 1986'equivalent. As

with the boarding allowance for students at the same age, this

payment will be taxable, but parents will have the option of

re-directing it to the student.

- For secondary students aged under 16 and primary students,

there will be an income tested allowance of up to $1,000

($19.20 a week) per student. The income test will be the same -

as for boarding allowances but, regardless of family income,

1  there will be a minimum payment for each eligible student of

the same level as is available free of income test in 1986.

This will be $500 for a correspondence student, and will varyN

according to the number of students in the family for second

home students.

../4

M134/86 A T T C H  3 . 4 .

Payments

- All payments for students boarding in schools, hostels or other

institutions will continue to be paid in advance at the

beginning of each term. ,

- For those in private board, studying by correspondence or

living in a second home, payments will be made fortnightly over

the whole calendar year from 1 January to 31 December as long

as the student is eligible.

Pre-school benefit ^

- The Government has decided that it is no longer appropriate to

extend benefits under the scheme to pre-school children

studying by correspondence and from the beginning of 1987 the

$120 a year special allowance will be discontinued.

M134/86 ATTACHMENT 4

POSTGRADUATE AWARDS IN 1987

Commonwealth Postgraduate Awards assist people studying full-time fqr Master1

and Ph.D degrees at universities and colleges of advanced education.

Awards are competitive and are tenable for up to two years for a Master's

course and up to four years for a Ph.D. They are not income tested, but

benefits are taxable.

Expenditure on Postgraduate Awards is expected to rise from $19.3 million in

1985-86 to about $21 million in 1986-87.

The essential elements of the scheme remain unchanged. The living allowance

will remain at $8,126 per annum.

However, a special supplementary payment of $250 will be made to compensate

award holders for the new administration charge on higher education students

to be levied from 1987.

In addition, the dependent child allowance will be increased from $16 to $17

per week. .  .

Unchanged are the dependent spouse allowance of $42.70 per week and

incidentals, thesis and establishment allowances.

An Award holder may continue to receive (or will now be able to receive)

$1,000Â· from an award provided by ari education institution and $5,000 from an

award provided by private sector sources without affecting the entitlement.
