LYNDAL CURTIS: Welcome to Capital Hill. I'm Lyndal Curtis.

Well, it's been a busy week in federal politics. The Prime Minister started the week in Perth  for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, and has ended the week in France for  the G20 meeting.

The mining tax has been introduced into parliament, although its passage is not guaranteed.  The carbon tax will go through the parliament next Tuesday. And the government managed  to get the planes back in the air during the Qantas dispute although it's still having

ramifications.

Joining me to discuss the week's events are frontbenchers from the Labor Party Richard  Marles, and from the Coalition Michael Keenan.

Welcome to you both.

RICHARD MARLES: Good afternoon.

MICHAEL KEENAN: Good afternoon Lyndal.

LYNDAL CURTIS: Richard Marles, has this been a good week for the government?

RICHARD MARLES: I think it has been a good week for the government.

We saw a very changed attitude towards industrial relations compared to the former  government in that we had a significant dispute affecting the whole country. We acted  straightaway in relation to that: a Fair Work hearing within five hours of the announcement  that the Qantas fleet would be grounded, and the fleet was back in the air 48 hours later.  Now, compare that to the period of the Howard government when we had a maritime dispute  which went for months and our wharves were shut. That was a stark contrast.

And, of course, in parliament we've seen the beginning of the debate around the MRRT, and  that's a real boost for superannuants throughout Australia as it is for small business.

LYNDAL CURTIS: Michael, the Coalition will see next week the carbon tax going through  the parliament but the mining tax isn't certain for the government, is it?

MICHAEL KEENAN: No, and it shouldn't go through because it's a very bad tax in the idea  behind it, but it's also being implemented terribly. The Labor Party sat down and did a deal  with the three biggest resource companies in Australia, and those resource companies  completely ran rings around Wayne Swan and his officials. And so what happened is they  managed to push all of that tax liability onto junior and mid-tier miners, particularly in my  home state of Western Australia, which of course is going to be a terrible thing for the mining  industry and the whole of the country. It's actually going to drive a dagger through the heart  of those small mining companies in Western Australia.

It's a terrible idea to just look for one particular industry which is making a good profit at the  moment and say we're going to tax it in a different way than other companies around  Australia. But the way the government has gone about it is just diabolically bad and in line  with the incompetence they always show on these issues.

LYNDAL CURTIS: One issue which crosses both of your portfolios is that of asylum  seekers. We've seen more boats arrive. We've also seen the tragedy off Java where at least  eight lives have been lost. Both your sides of politics agree with the question of offshore  processing. Do you think there's a very good reason for the Australian public to say why can't  you both just sit down and figure it out?

RICHARD MARLES: Well, what we want to see is a stop to the boats coming. And that  means we have to have a robust policy in place to provide a disincentive to boats coming and  that's what the Malaysian arrangement represented. In that sense, it is very different to Nauru,  which simply wouldn't be the disincentive that the Malaysian arrangement is.

Now, of course, that's the government's view. We understand the Opposition have a different  view in relation to that. But in order to implement either view, we actually need to return the  law in this country to the position that everyone understood it to be before the High Court  decision and that's the proposition that we were seeking to put through the parliament.

So I think the government would love to see the parliament act on this issue, but we actually  need to see the Opposition come forward and say they're willing to engage in that process as  well.

MICHAEL KEENAN: Well, we need to understand why it is we're actually here. The  reason we've had 251 boats carrying 13,000 people arrive in Australia illegally is because the  Labor Party abolished offshore processing when they came to government. They broke the

system of robust border protection that they had inherited when the Australian people  changed government in 2007.

So they broke it, and now apparently they are the ones who are going to fix it, even though  they've had every single policy position on this issue, apart from one that we know actually  works.

RICHARD MARLES: Well, can I make…

MICHAEL KEENAN: It is very important that the parliament does address this issue, and  all it will take is for the Labor Party to agree to one very minor amendment to the changes  that they're proposing, and which will give them 150 countries in which they can process  people offshore, just with one minor safeguard, that those countries are signatories to the UN  Convention on Refugees, something the Labor Party used to believe was terribly important.  But now they seem to have abandoned it in their rush to embrace…

RICHARD MARLES: Well it's something that, to be fair…

MICHAEL KEENAN: …this diabolically bad Malaysia solution.

RICHARD MARLES: Nice line, but a bit cute. One minor amendment, of course, puts a  line through the government's stated policy on actually dealing with this issue, so there's no  sense in which that represents a meaningful compromise…

LYNDAL CURTIS: It…

RICHARD MARLES: And we shouldn't say that the Opposition have somehow got this  new-found commitment to countries which are signatories to the Refugee Convention,  because of course it remains their policy to tow boats back to Indonesia which is not a  signatory.

LYNDAL CURTIS: It does seem like we won't be able to solve this now. My hopes have  been dashed, so we'll move on.

Unsurprisingly, not a week has gone by without mention of the Labor leadership. There was a  story this morning in the News Limited paper The Daily Telegraph about it, and this was the  response.

[File excerpts]

DOUG CAMERON: And my view is that the inquiry we are having into the media, we  should widen it to make sure that we've got a decent press in this country. The Murdoch press  are an absolute disgrace. They are a threat to democracy in this country, and we should  absolutely be having a look at them. They are absolutely outrageous.

ERIC ABETZ: It is no secret around this building that Kevin Rudd is trying to make a  comeback, and here we have Senator Cameron blaming the Murdoch press for it. I ask you, if  that is what he actually believes, he is hugely deluded.

[End excerpts]

LYNDAL CURTIS: Richard Marles, stories in newspapers, stories in the media will come  and go. Whatever the merits of them, do you need to go to the extent that Doug Cameron  suggests of actually formally inquiring more deeply into the Murdoch press or do you just  brush off the story?

RICHARD MARLES: I think the first thing to say is that the story we saw on the front page  of The Daily Telegraph this morning was silly. It was completely baseless and really, in my  view, was a kind of fish and chip wrapper story.

You know, Doug can explain his own comments. I don't think we're about to see any new  inquiry into the media. In a way, we don't need any inquiry to understand the rubbish that was  printed on the front page of The Daily Telegraph this morning.

LYNDAL CURTIS: Michael Keenan, the Coalition in the past has had its own leadership  woes and seen stories like this come and go. Do you have any sympathy for the Labor Party?

MICHAEL KEENAN: Well, no I don't, because these are problems all of their own making.  And look, there's something quite sinister I think about Doug Cameron coming out and  saying, when the media are reporting what everybody in this building knows, in fact surely

everybody in Australia knows, and that is Kevin Rudd is making another run for the  leadership of the Labor Party.

And when the media reports on that speculation from Labor sources, the response of the  Labor Party is to say that the - is to attack the media and say that the parliament should use all  the resources at its disposal to intimidate the media into not reporting these things that  everybody knows are happening.

I really think that was quite a sinister contribution from Doug Cameron. And Labor Party  members should, quite frankly, and Richard should as well, come out and say they don't  believe that that's an appropriate response from the government when they're rightly criticised

in the media or when the media is just reporting on things that we all know are happening.

RICHARD MARLES: Well, as I said, I don't think we're about to see any inquiries in  relation to the media. But, frankly, what we have seen is a whole lot of reporting which is  based on media talking to media, or talking to the Opposition.

When it comes to the question of leadership, Julia Gillard is doing a fabulous job in what are  obviously difficult circumstances in terms of the challenges which are facing this country  today. But she's meeting those challenges.

The carbon price has now passed the House of Representatives. This is an important reform  for the country. We've seen the Minerals Resource Rent Tax entered into the House of  Representatives this week. Again, a really difficult issue dealing with a patchwork economy,  but we're dealing with it.

She's doing a fantastic job in that role and her leadership is, frankly, not on the agenda within  the Labor caucus.

LYNDAL CURTIS: Michael, your - there's also talk about whether Tony Abbot should get  on the front foot more, put out some positive policies. Your party room heard this week that  most of the policy work has been done. Should those policies start seeing the light of day?

MICHAEL KEENAN: Well, we have done a lot of policy work and a lot of them are  already out there. And we do have policy consistency between what we took to the Australian  people last time and what we'll take this time because, unlike the Labor Party, we actually  believe in certain things and those core beliefs don't constantly change…

RICHARD MARLES: Well, not offshore processing.

MICHAEL KEENAN: The problem we have with the Labor Party is that they have no idea  what they believe in, there's no agenda coming from Julia Gillard and the Labor Party about  where they want to take Australia. And of course all they are is completely obsessed with  who they're going to get to be their next leader.

The Prime Minister can't do any serious governing because all she has to do is watch her back  whilst the faceless men of the Labor Party decide whether they want Kevin Rudd or Stephen  Smith to be the next leader.

LYNDAL CURTIS: This morning the Leader of the House, Anthony Albanese, briefed the  House on the arrangements for the visit by the US President Barack Obama. He'll address the  House on 17 November. Christopher Pyne, the - his Opposition counterpart got up and gave a  speech where he talked about the Labor leadership changing before George Bush came out  here. Was that an appropriate thing to bring up in the context of this visit?

MICHAEL KEENAN: Well, it was a few factual things and - which are beyond dispute.  And I'm not sure why the Labor Party was so precious about it. The last time we had a US  President come and give the Australian parliament the honour of addressing it was George  Bush, and at that time the Labor Party got up and the then Manager of Opposition Business  Mark Latham moved amendments and said how outrageous it was and what a waste of  taxpayers' money it was, that the US President would come and address the Australian  parliament. And of course we know that Mark Latham had also made some very anti-American remarks before that.

So I thought it was just a few factual comments from Christopher. I'm really not sure why  Labor is so precious about it.

RICHARD MARLES: I'm utterly astounded that Michael and the Liberal Party are now  taking a leaf out of Mark Latham's book when it comes to the ways in which to deal with a  presidential visit to this country. I mean, seriously…

LYNDAL CURTIS: But doesn't it just show that Oppositions of all sides will play politics  when they get the chance?

RICHARD MARLES: What it shows is that they're working from the Mark Latham  playbook when it comes to dealing with a visit from the United States President. And I  absolute…

MICHAEL KEENAN: [Interrupts] [Indistinct] campaign for Mark to be prime minister of  Australia.

RICHARD MARLES: Well then I'm not exactly sure why you're supporting the way in  which he behaved then, in the way in which Christopher Pyne is behaving today.

The thing is this: our relationship with the United States is unquestionably the most important  bilateral relationship that this country has. The alliance is a cornerstone of our foreign policy.  And a visit by a United States President to this country is both a rare and significant thing and  it must be above politics. And I note that the Shadow Foreign spokesperson, Julie Bishop, I  think gave a very dignified speech in the parliament today.

But what Christopher Pyne did was utterly outrageous and it formed part of a tradition,  actually, that we've got on the part of the Liberal Party now in criticising Barack Obama. We  heard the former prime minister, John Howard, equate a presidential win by Barack Obama  as being a win for terrorism. We've heard the current…

LYNDAL CURTIS: But that was some time ago in very different circumstances.

RICHARD MARLES: But we've got the current Leader of the Opposition saying that  Barack Obama sounds better than he really is. I think its incumbent on the Opposition to treat  this visit with the absolute dignity that it deserves and the importance that it has for this  country's foreign policy.

LYNDAL CURTIS: Michael, what do you think an address by a leader like a US President  does mean?

MICHAEL KEENAN: Well, I think it's a great affirmation about the relationship that we  have with the United States. And of course in the Coalition parties we don't have any qualms  about that relationship where of course in the Labor Party what you'll find is that there'll be a  whole diversity of views…

RICHARD MARLES: We founded the relationship, Michael.

LYNDAL CURTIS: Please let Michael answers.

MICHAEL KEENAN: And [indistinct] the Labor Party of course traditionally they have not  supported the relationship as strongly as the Coalition does.

It is our most important international relationship on so many levels and the idea that we  wouldn't support a visit by the President of the United States is clearly ludicrous.

A few political jibes against the government hardly represent the hysterical things that  Richard was saying about it. And, quite frankly, I don't think that this is a serious debate. The  Coalition obviously supports our relationship with the United States and we're very pleased  that President Obama is visiting to reaffirm the importance of that relationship.

LYNDAL CURTIS: Now, just finally and quickly, we're racing towards the end of the  parliamentary year. It's been very rancorous in parliament. Any chance of a bit of goodwill  and bonhomie as we go towards the Christmas season?

MICHAEL KEENAN: Richard and I will certainly be having a drink after this program…

RICHARD MARLES: [Laughs]

MICHAEL KEENAN: But I'm not sure it will extend further than that because  unfortunately we have the most incompetent government in Australia that anyone can  remember in living memory. And it's not good for this government to be continuing until  2013. They're making all the wrong decisions. They're completely internally focused. And the  best thing we could have in Australia is an election so that people can decide whether they  think this experiment in minority government has worked or not, and I think the resounding  answer will be no.

RICHARD MARLES: Well, I think what we've got on the part of the Opposition is a  policy-free zone. I mean, they say no to everything and in the process change their positions  on absolutely anything 180 degrees; climate change, offshore processing, you name it. They'll  do whatever they can to say no to the government.

LYNDAL CURTIS: With that, I think the chance of Christmas card exchange is very  limited, but thank you very much for your time.

RICHARD MARLES: Thanks Lyndal.

MICHAEL KEENAN: Thank you.
