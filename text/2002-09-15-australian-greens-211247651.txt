Annual National Conference Marks the 10th Anniversary of Australian Greens

Greens address the likely war on Iraq, the Cunningham by-election, Greenhouse and Labor’s policy failure on asylum seekers

The Australian Greens annual national conference in Brisbane, marking the 10th anniversary of the party, has adopted a set of dynamic polices and electoral plans that will assist the party in the forthcoming national and state elections as well as the federal by-election in Cunningham.

“In particular discussion of the looming war with Iraq has been high on our agenda. The Greens have determined to oppose such a war and will be active in ensuring a lively community protest movement is mobilised against any possible Australian involvement in a war on Iraq,” Greens Senator Bob Brown said

“The Greens in the Senate will push again next week for a Senate inquiry into the possible war similar to inquiries already underway in the US.

“The Greens will also start contingency plans for a possible early double dissolution ‘war’ election which John Howard could call on the back of a US led invasion of Iraq,” Senator Brown said.

“On the back of this weekend’s record Greens opinion poll of 9% nationally the Greens will be running a strong campaign in Cunningham by-election with local preselection to occur on Monday,” Greens Senator Kerry Nettle said.

“The Greens conference expressed alarm that the ALP is set to adopt a new refugee policy that would imprison asylum seekers on the excised Christmas Island. This would simply turn the Pacific solution to an Indian Ocean solution effectively reviving a Pauline Hanson proposal.

“The Greens also undertook to push for a 60% reduction in Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions as well as ratification of the Kyoto protocol as a small step on the path to halting global warming,” Senator Nettle said.

“The Greens conference expressed alarm that the ALP is set to adopt a new refugee policy that would imprison asylum seekers on the excised Christmas Island.  This would simply turn the Pacific solution to an Indian Ocean solution and is reviving a policy Pauline Hanson proposed before the last election.
