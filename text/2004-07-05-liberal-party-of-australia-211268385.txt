Unauthorised Boat Arrivals: One Child in a Detention Centre

Minister for Immigration, Amanda Vanstone, today announced that as at c.o.b. today only one  child, whose parents were unauthorised boat arrivals, is in a mainland detention centre.

“His mother was offered a place at the Residential Housing Project in Port Augusta but chose  to remain at Baxter with the father at least for the first few months of the child’s life.

“Many people do not realise that out of the thousands of unauthorised boat arrivals  from 2000/2001, over 8,500 people are out in the community on protection visas.

“Those few who remain in detention do so because they have been found not to be refugees  and are currently challenging that decision in tribunals and Courts.

“Nonetheless, the Government has consistently worked over the past three years to find better  alternatives for women and children in detention.

“The consistent aim of the Government has been to reduce the number of women and  children in detention centres. This is highlighted by the announcement in this year’s Budget of  $27.4 million over 4 years for new Residential Housing Projects in Sydney and Perth and other  alternative detention arrangements.

“The alternative detention options offered by the Government are much greater than those  ever offered by Labor and include:  Ã¢ÂÂ¢  Residential  Housing  Projects   Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Foster care arrangements with state welfare authorities

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Community care placements for people with special needs

“Aside from the one remaining child at Baxter, there are around 30 children of routine  compliance cases in mainland detention centres. These children’s parents either overstayed  their visa or breached their visa conditions and are awaiting removal.

“There are 11 Vietnamese children on Christmas Island who are appealing decisions that they  are not refugees.

“Following the Government’s agreement with the UNHCR last year to review the Australian  Afghani caseload 146 Afghanis, including 55 children, were reassessed as being refugees  after changed conditions in Afghanistan. All will be resettled in Australia.  Some have already  arrived.  The remainder are expected to have arrived by  week ending Friday 16th July.  That  will leave 19 children in total on Nauru.”
