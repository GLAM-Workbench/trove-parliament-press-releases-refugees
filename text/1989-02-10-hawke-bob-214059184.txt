PRIME MINISTER

CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY

SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER  3RD INDIRA GANDHI MEMORIAL LECTURE  NEW DELHI - 10 FEBRUARY 1939

Indira Gandhi was a leader of indomitable tenacity and  courage.

I had the privilege of knowing her,  working with her -  indeed, even enjoying some differences of emphasis with her -  here in this city at the 1983 Commonwealth Heads of  Government Meeting.

Tonight I salute her as a leader who left an indelible  imprint on the political, economic and social life of India,  and ensured that India's voice was heard with force and  clarity in world affairs.

So to deliver a lecture in memory of Indira Gandhi - and to  deliver it in the capital of the India which she loved so  dearly - is an honour which I greatly appreciate.

Just as today you Mr Prime Minister derive strength from the  achievements of your predecessors, so Indira Gandhi drew on  the rich heritage of leadership bequeathed by her father  Jawaharlal Nehru and before him, by Mahatma Gandhi.

Part of the greatness of these leaders was that their ideas  and their policies and their actions had a resonance and a  relevance that went far beyond the borders of their own  country.

Mahatma Gandhi gave us the noble doctrine of non-violent  stfrbggle in the face of oppression, the belief that human  dignity should not be demeaned by violence even >in mobilising  the masses to overthrow colonial rule.

His visionary campaign against racial discrimination has  become an international crusade.  Australia, India and other  nations have come together in particular to bring pressure to  bear on the South African authorities to rid that country of

the ugliness and inhumanity that is apartheid.

2 .

Nehru, the centenary of whose birth we mark this year,   bequeathed a different and equally rich heritage of political  leadership. Nehru forged a nation- with his unyielding  adherence to principles of humanism, secularism, democracy

and equity.

The forty years after the Second World War have been among  the most turbulent,  certainly the most dynamic, in human  history.  Massive social,  economic, political, and scientific  upheaval has transformed our world.

In all these turbulent times, there has been one constant  which has dominated the world scene - the East/West '   confrontation.

The influence of East/West tension has been felt everywhere.   The extraordinary achievement of decolonisation became  entangled in it. Regional conflicts were fought as  surrogates of the wider confrontation.

The United Nations, founded with high hopes and with a sober  consciousness of the need for nations to work together to  avoid the scourge of war,  and to seek some common ideals of  justice and equity, became to some degree another  battleground for what was seen as a bigger dispute. It was

unable to play as full a role in international security as  was envisaged by its founders.

The best efforts of the international community to cope with  poverty,  hunger,  human rights, economic growth,  refugees  were,  to a greater or lesser extent,  diminished by the  injection of the East/West rivalry.  Even the Non-Aligned  Movement, founded precisely as a reaction to this crude

divide, has itself not been free of internal disputes over  the relative merits of East and West.

What is remarkable is that so much was achieved in that  period - in decolonisation,  in the UN system, and elsewhere.   But that so much less was accomplished than should have been  accomplished was due in no small part to the a11-pervasive  nature of East/West hostility.

And, most ominously of all, inherent in the East-West  confrontation was the danger of nuclear war,  of global  annihilation. .

Mrs Gandhi saw these problems,  and as a leader of one of the  great nations of the world, she worked to help overcome them.   But even a leader as far-sighted as Mrs Gandhi would have  shared with us a sense of astonishment at how remarkably the  world has changed in the four years since her tragic and

untimely death.

3 .

In arms control and disarmament,  the superpowers have forged  the INF agreement, the first arms control agreement to cut  the number of nuclear weapons, rather than to mandate a  stipulated level of increase.

Although much remains to be done, much has already been done  towards the conclusion of an agreement to cut by about 50%  the number of strategic nuclear warheads.

Almost as spectacular has been progress in resolving regional  conflicts. During the seventies and early eighties we heard  much of an arc of instability. We see now, if not an arc of  peace, then at least an arc of peace-making, stretching from

southern Africa, through the Persian Gulf, through  Afghanistan and South Asia and on to Indochina.

The United Nations is being revitalised and is playing an  indispensable part in resolving regional conflicts.

This transformation in the world scene has taken place in  breathtakingly short time. What has brought it about?  The answer in large measure is a change in attitude, a  reassessment of interests, a response to new realities by  East and West.

Speaking as the leader of a Western alliance country  unalterably committed to the system of liberal democracy, I  consider that it is very important to recognise that the gap  between the political values and social and economic systems

of the US and the Soviet Union remains profound.

Nonetheless, I believe it is already clear that the  superpowers no longer see their competition as having only  one possible outcome - to be victor or vanquished, winner or  loser.

The relationship is today a far cry from that of two cold  warriors. Rivalry yes, competition yes, differences yes; but  not implacable hostility, to be played out to check mate on  some global political chess board.

To understand why this transformation has occurred, clearly  one half of the equation is what is happening in the policies  of the Soviet Union.

4 .

Soon after General-Secretary Gorbachev took office,  he began  a process of root and branch change in the economic, social,   political and cultural life of hrs~nation. In international  affairs, Australia will judge by deeds, not just words. But

I do acknowledge this - there have been deeds, including in  arms control,  regional conflicts and human rights.  I draw  encouragement from this.

Of course there have been premature declarations in the past  that the Cold War is over - not least at the beginning of the  last decade.  But there is good analytical reason,  not just  hope, that what we are seeing now will not prove to be

another false dawn.

My view, informed by ray own conversations with Mr Gorbachev  and his colleagues, is that what we are seeing in Soviet  developments is far more fundamental than earlier efforts at  Soviet reform.

Mr Gorbachev has said - and there is reason in Soviet  behaviour to believe he means it - that the Soviet Union's  world view is no longer dictated by conceptions of  international class war and the inevitable defeat of

capitalism.

Above all, it is absolutely clear that highly centralised  command economies can no longer compete in the international  economy.

As you fully recognise, Mr Prime Minister,  modern economies,  to be viable, must place a premium on adaptability, on free  flows of information, on entreneurship,  on dissent and  debate,  on unfettered scientific research and technological  change.

These in turn require the freeing up of political  institutions and economic and social controls.

Without these, the Soviet Union will, as Mr Gorbachev has  himself said repeatedly, inevitably decline.

So it is for these more objective reasons that I am perhaps  more confident than many that the course on which the Soviet  Union has embarked is one which it is likely to stay on for  the foreseeable future.

The indispensible other half of the equation in explaining  the improvement in superpower relations lies with the United  States.

5.

Paradoxically, President Reagan, deeply conservative in so  many of his attitudes, showed himself capable of finding  common ground with his Soviet counterpart,  of establishing a  basis of trust with him on important areas of mutual concern,

and of taking a truly radical path on arms control.

From what I know of President Bush and his colleagues, I am  absolutely confident that a continuation of the new approach  from Moscow will find a co-operative spirit of good will in  the United States.

In devoting this amount of time to East-West relations as the  dominant factor in world affairs now and for many ye'ars to  come,  I do not want to ignore other developments which are  also driving forces for change.

China's modernisation program is entering its second decade.  From Australia's perspective,  it has had an enormously  favourable impact on the Asia-Pacific region.

"Perestroika‚Äù is much newer.  The economic problems facing  China and the Soviet Union are far from identical. But the  fact that both countries are giving priority to the urgent  agenda of economic reform over the pursuit of strategic and

idealogical rivalry goes a long way to explain the current  improvement in their relations.At the same time, the dynamic  economic performance of the newly industrialised economies  has shattered many prejudices about the developing world in

general and about Asia in particular.

The spectacular economic successes of countries such as the  Republic of Korea, and, now, countries like Thailand, are  illustrating - as I have seen again only last week - that the  Asia-Pacific region has become the most important focal point

of international economic dynamism.

Its impressive growth strategies are being studied and  emulated, and it is being courted by prospective investors,  joint venturers and exporters from all.corners of the globe.  Increasingly, its growth is becoming more self sustaining and  less dependent on access to affluent Western markets.

And with economic success comes greater political self  assurance.

Indeed it could be said that where we were,  in the Cold War  years,  used to assessing the clout of a nation by its  political or strategic significance, nations can now exercise  great influence based solely on their economic strength.  We

see in Japan an example of a new phenomenon - an economic  superpower.

6.

So all these developments would surely have surprised and  gratified Indira Gandhi.

But as the leader of a great democracy, she would perhaps  have been encouraged by nothing so much as by the wider  spread throughout the world of democratic rule.

This has its roots in a number of different factors.

In Latin America, in South-East Asia, and most recently next  door to you in Pakistan,  authoritarian regimes have  discredited themselves and have been replaced by democratic  leaders governing with popular consent. '

Elsewhere in the world - and particularly in Asian economies  such as the Republic of Korea - the rising living standards  that are the fruit of dynamic economic growth are being  accompanied by a liberalisation of political structures.

And perhaps most encouraging of all, we see even in China,  the Soviet Union, and parts of Eastern Europe, the efforts of  a new generation of leaders who understand that for their  efforts to be successful a simple, old-fashioned reliance an  authoritarian command is no longer sufficient. They realise

that for positive economic change to succeed, political self  respect is an essential precondition.

That is a fact that Australians and Indians,  proudly and  unshakeably democrats, know to be a profound and undeniable  truth.

Ladies and gentlemen. √Ç¬∑

To review as I have done all these welcome trends - the rapid  transformation of relations between the superpowers;  the  economic dynamism of countries that were once only limited  players in the world economy; the spread of democracy -  provides sufficient evidence for the conclusion that we are  on the verge of a new era in world affairs.

My judgement is that this will be an era in which the  rhetoric of the Cold War will be out of date and misleading;  an era in which building prosperity and peace must be our  prime task, not building the arsenals of war;  an era in which  we may,  at long last, begin to balance what is today a

puzzling asymmetry between the seemingly boundless  technological skills of humanity and our much less developed  social skills of feeding the hungry,  sheltering the homeless  and protecting the natural environment of the planet we  share.

7 .

In speaking in this optimistic way I do not seek to pretend  that all is well in the world today or that we can afford to  be complacent as we enter this new- era.

For all that we have reason for'satisfaction with the  progress that has been made across all the areas I have  outlined, our confidence for the future must be conditional  on the performance of four critical tasks.

They are these:

We must achieve greater flexibility in the organisation and  operation both of our domestic economies and of the global  economy.

We must achieve further cuts in the levels of nuclear and  conventional arms.

We must strengthen the practice and institutions of  multilateralism.

And underpinning all those tasks, we must see the  entrenchment and the futher spread of democracy,  tolerance,   individual liberties, and respect for human rights.

It is no accident that I put at the head of my list economic  factors in both their international and domestic dimensions.

Increasingly, the economic process has a global base. Capital has a worldwide mobility, as increasingly do skills,  entrepreneurship and the adaptation of technology.

These are major changes,  and they are already having a  profound impact on the behaviour and inter-relation of  states. These changes mean that domestic economic policy  making can no longer proceed for any country in isolation

from that global base.

Ultimately, the poverty or prosperity of any one nation  depends on the poverty or prosperity of us all - just as,  ultimately, the physical security of each nation is enhanced  by an environment in which all nations feels secure.

Even the superpowers are having to alter their domestic  economic policies in order to maintain their standing in the  world and to keep up with the pace of change.: I have already mentioned Mr Gorbachev's reforms. In the United States,  President Bush faces twin budget and balance of trade

deficits which, if not addressed effectively, could call into  question its past position as the overwhelmingly dominant  economic power and its capacity to sustain long-standing  global political and strategic policies.

8.

Likewise, a major area of activity for us in Australia, and  for you in India, has been the restructuring of our domestic  economies to adapt to the changing global environment.

But at a time when international financial markets and  exchange rates are being freed up, and at a time when  individual nations, be they capitalist or socialist, are  making efforts to improve their efficiency and

competitiveness, one fundamentally important area is being  pushed in the opposite direction.

International trade, which if it too were liberalised'on a  multilateral basis would provide a massive boost to  prosperity everywhere,  is increasingly being subjected to  ever more restrictive and inefficient measures.

Here on the one hand is a growing recognition by nations of  the need for economic adjustment - and on the other hand  their refusal to apply that insight to an area of central  importance to the wellbeing of us all.

Thus we are witness to the major paradox of our time.  Precisely at the point when the world has greater cause for  optimism arising from the increasingly intelligent political  relations between the superpowers, the realisable vision of a

saner world, using its resources more productively for the  betterment of mankind, is being put at risk by the  intransigence and shortsightedness now characterising the  relations of the most powerful market-based economies on this

issue of international trade.

Economies which have built their prosperity on co-operative  free trade now put that principle in jeopardy, while  superpowers which had become accustomed to the habits of  their dangerous rivalry now adjust to the challenges of  constructive rapprochement.

If history teaches us anything, it teaches us that where  economic deprivation and injustice go, instability and even  hostility tend to follow, whether within countries or between  them.

So a fair and open international trading regime is vital not  only to prosperity but to sound and harmonious relations  between nations. :

Australia, as a nation whose exporting capacity has  traditionally relied heavily on agricultural commodities, has  sought, and continues to seek, positive and constructive  outcomes in the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade  negotiations.

9.

The benefits of success in this endeavour will not of course  be limited solely to agricultural‚Äúexporters.

They will be shared by the consumers within those heavily  subsidising developed economies,  the European Community,  the  United States and Japan.

Agricultural trade liberalisation would bring particular  benefits to developing countries.

Freer world trade would provide a means whereby they can  directly benefit from the prosperity of riiore fortunate  countries.

It would also encourage developing countries to integrate  themselves more with the world economy.  They cannot prosper  while their price structures do not reflect those prevailing  internationally.

In this sense the alleviation of world poverty requires  policy flexibility both internationally and in the developing  countries themselves.

It is vital that this alleviation occur,  not just for the  humanitarian benefit to those currently living in poverty -  although this is certainly sufficient reason - but also  because the world will never be stable and secure while we  have intolerably stark contrasts in national living

standards.

And may I add how galling it must be for developing  countries,  as it is for Australia,  to hear the leading  industrial nations preach to others the virtues,  indeed the  necessity, of practising policy discipline and budgetary

restraint, which they give little indication of following  themselves.

The √É¬é√Ç¬Ø  second key area in which there must be progress as we  enter this new era is arms control and disarmament. Certainly there has been unexpected progress,  and more may be  in prospect.

But, even if the START talks bear fruit, I do not think it  churlish to say, "Good.  We want more.  And quickly".  Even  with both the INF and START agreements in place, the Soviet  Union and the United States will still possess at least

12,000 strategic warheads,  to say nothing of the thousands of  tactical weapons not covered by agreements,  and the nuclear  weapons of the United Kingdom,  France and China.

10 .

To me, then,  while these present and prospective agreements  are enormously welcome,  they should not lull us into  complacency about the nuclear-danger.

Nuclear deterrence, vital though it is while nuclear weapons  exist, is unacceptable as a permanent feature of our world.

The consequence of this is that the goal of arms control must  be nuclear disarmament.

It is true that this path will be a long and difficult one -  but it is the path we must deliberately and consciously  tread. '

I would not accept any view that declares the elimination of  nuclear weapons to be ultimately pointless because of the  impossibility of locking up again the secret of nuclear  weapons manufacture.

Many countries have the technological and industrial base for  developing nuclear weapons,  if they so chose.

Many have security interests which they consider to be just  as important as the security interests of the existing  nuclear weapons states. They have rejected the nuclear  option.

No matter how pressing immediate political or military  considerations may seem, no matter how understandable may be  frustration at the pace of progress towards nuclear  disarmament,  no matter how galling may be the existence of  nuclear weapons exclusivity, it is supremely in the interest

of the survival of our world that no other countries acquire  nuclear weapons.  Once the nuclear taboo is broken - once the  dike of nuclear proliferation is breached - the odds that  someday, somewhere nuclear weapons will be used rise

dramatically.

It is for this reason that we consider the Nuclear  Non-Proliferation Treaty to be the most important single arms  control agreement in existence. I know, of course, that  √É¬¢√Ç¬ñ√Ç¬†Irldia has criticisms of the Treaty.  I understand India's

view but I must say that Australia does not agree.  Whatever  criticisms may be levelled against the Treaty cannot begin to  warrant putting it in jeopardy.

We cannot let the best, which is the goal of nuclear  disarmament,  become the enemy of the good, which is the NPT.

\

11.

India is the one non-nuclear weapon state which has  demonstrated a nuclear explosive capability. I frankly wish  that capability had not been developed, but given the reality  I urge that you continue firmly* To reject the production of  nuclear weapons.

Without any reservation we encourage India to support the  maintenance of the NPT regime.

Against this background, we welcome as a positive step the  recent agreement between India and Pakistan prohibiting  attacks against each other's nuclear installations. We very  much hope that further practical confidence-building; measures

exemplified by this agreement will lead to the ultimate,  accession to the NET. and_-acceptance of the full scope of  International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards by India and

Pakistan.

The nuclear weapons states, who have a vital interest in the  NPT, must play their part in its maintenance by fulfilling  the obligations they have undertaken under Article VI of the  Treaty to move towards nuclear disarmament. Specifically -

and you know Australia and India are fully in agreement on  this - they must move towards the conclusion of a.. Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty as a matter of urgency.

It will be apparent from all that. I have said so far that  many crucial international economic and security issues by  their nature are susceptible to resolution only through the  multilateral process.

As we move into the next decade, we will have to cope with  new problems - such as the scourge of narcotics, other  international forms of crime including terrorism, as well as  other non-military threats to security. These problems

require global solutions, and frankly we have been slow to  mobilise to meet them.

The third point then to which we will need to devote time and  effort over the coming years is the revitalisation of  existing multilateral institutions and, where necessary, the  creation of new ones.

Our commitment to multilateralism is based on our belief in  the importance of establishing and enforcing acceptable norms  of international behaviour. As international law. extends,  beyond traditional land boundaries to cover first the sea and  now outer space as well, we are concerned to seek that the

totality of interests of humanity are well protected.

1 2.

wnr Australia and India,  this will be a welcome task,  because  we have been among the most prominent multilateralists in the  international community. ___

The multilateral dialogue between India and Australia in  diverse fields - arms control, decolonisation,  economic and  trade issues,  apartheid and human rights - represents a  substantial component in the sum of contacts between our two  countries.  Our differences on some key issues make this  dialogue all the more important,  not less.

Among the problems requiring urgent multilateral action  perhaps the most serious is the growing threat to our natural  environment.  Greatly increased emission of greenhouse gases  is threatening to bring about potentially cataclysmic global  climatic change.  Tropical forests are being destroyed at a  disastrous rate.  The ozone layer is thinning from the

release of large quantities of chlorofluorocarbons into the  atmosphere.

With the threat of nuclear holocaust diminishing as arms  control negotiations continue,  the equally potent but more  insidious threat of environmental disaster is quite rightly  generating growing community concern around the world.

Likewise,  the negotiated reductions of the nuclear arsenals  prove that, with good will and mutual trust, mankind can  consciously enhance the prospects for environmental  protection.

At a time when economic growth is so vital to raising living  standards,  especially in less developed nations,  there is a  genuine and growing belief - sometimes bordering on fear and  despair - that economic growth is jeopardising our capacity

to bequeath to our children their rightful heritage: the irreplaceable beauty and value of the forests and jungles,   the rivers and oceans,  even the air we breathe.

I reject the doctrine of despair that the twin goals of  economic growth and environmental security are incompatible.

√Ç¬´But I recognise resolution of the dilemma will require  co-ordinated action of the most careful,  and yet the most  decisive, nature by governments and individuals.

For Australia's part,  we have these issues firmly on my  Government's policy agenda.  Last year I initiated work by my  Ministers to develop Australia‚Äôs strategy to contribute to  international environmental action.

13.

I: believe we are seeing a greater responsiveness,  a greater  preparedness to act, throughout the world, and that political  commitment to environmental protection will intensify during  the year.

I;  am.also pleased that the environment will be a major theme  at our next Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting.

Ladies and gentlemen,

As we prepare to enter the 1990s and to face the three tasks  I have outlined so far,  the network of friendly international  relations, such as exists between Australia and Indi'a, will  continue to be a great asset.

India and Australia have always been friends.

Now it is time to consolidate our relationship.

It is my belief that, in this changing world of growing  economic interdependence,  we are going to need each other  more.

Australia and India must do more to exploit the great  potential of our economic relationship.  I am delighted that  in our talks over the past two days,  Prime Minister Gandhi  and I have agreed on steps to accomplish this.

Closer links between Australia and India will serve not only  the interests of our two countries, important though that is.  They will also make a contribution to the stability and  wellbeing of the region and to our ability to work together

in helping shape the international environment.

Ladies and gentlemen,

There is one other important bond between India and Australia  and it should not be overlooked in this attempt of mine to  review the opportunities and challenges faced by the  international community in the decade leading to the 21st  century.

I said before that there were four essential tasks for the  future. So far I have only given you three.

The fourth is the keystone to them all: the n e e d  to preserve  and expand the practices of democracy.

14.

In the capital city of the world‚Äôs largest democracy, I can  say with conviction and pride that Australians,  like Indians,  place absolute confidence in--the abiding qualities of a  democratic society: individual liberty, the just rule of xlaw, tolerance of diversity and free and fair participation

lin the machinery of representative government.

You know as well as I do, Prime Minister,  the occasional  frustrations of democratic leadership.  But robust debate and  time consuming negotiations are essential elements of  democratic government and provide the best way towards the

formulation and implementation of effective policy.

It was your grandfather who put it this way: ‚ÄùDemocracy is good. I say this because other systems are worse."

Our peoples are fortunate indeed to be entering the 1990s  equipped in the best possible way for the tasks ahead -  equipped with the knowledge,  based on our deepest experience,   that those societies built on the principles and practices of

democracy will be the most successful and will foster the  greatest good for its people.

I feel profoundly privileged to have been given the  opportunity of leadership of a democratic nation at this time  of immense global change, of breathtaking opportunity,  of  profound challenge.

We are here to celebrate Mrs Gandhi - her memory and her  achievements.  Hers were harsh and dangerous times - times  when the nuclear danger seemed to grow almost with a life of  its own,  despite the best efforts and intentions of men and  women of good will - times when great concepts of liberty,

justice,  and equality, manifested in the struggle for  decolonisation and against racism, became snared in the  entangling web of the East/West conflict - times when the  scientific and technological fruits of man's labours did far  less than they could to overcome the poverty and suffering of  millions.

We who have come after her are privileged to live in a  -different time, a new era. We can do no better for her  memory than to seize these new hopes and new possibilities  with the same largeness of heart, generosity of spirit, and

single-minded determination which she showed throughout her  life and work.  "
