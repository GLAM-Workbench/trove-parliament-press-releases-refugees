Sky News AM Agenda with Kieran Gilbert



26 July 2011

E&OE

Subjects: Malaysia asylum-seeker deal, Norway massacre: video games and gun  laws.

KIERAN GILBERT: We'll be joined shortly by the Shadow

Attorney-General Senator George Brandis.  First, though, the Trade Minister Craig  Emerson with me here in the Canberra studio.

Minister, thanks for your time.

CRAIG EMERSON: My pleasure.

GILBERT: The Malaysia deal: there's a lot of uncertainty

still around, even though the deal's been done.  There's, you know, question marks as to  whether it will work once that 800 quota is full.  What does the Government do then?

EMERSON: The idea here is to break the people

smugglersÃ¢ÂÂ commercial cycle; if you like, the  offering that they have to make. And it would  be a rather poor offering from this day on,  where the people smugglers effectively would  be saying to clients, Ã¢ÂÂget on a boat, pay a lot of

2



money to us - the people smugglers - take a  risky journey to Australia, Christmas Island,  and within a matter of days you'll be in

MalaysiaÃ¢ÂÂ, which is where many, if not most of  the people came from in the first place.

So for this cycle to go from a country of origin,

through Malaysia, through Indonesia, to  Australia and back to Malaysia, doesn't sound  like a really attractive commercial prospect.

GILBERT: But the Government for so long argued that it

was the push factors that were to blame, not  the pull factors. Now it seems there's a much  heavier focus on what's described as the pull  factors, the attractiveness of the proposition  once people get here.

EMERSON: Well, of course, people are fleeing from

different countries and it wasn't only Labor  people who said the push factors are

enormous; that's actually a direct statement of  Malcolm Turnbull's, that the push factors are  enormous. Having lobbed into the region, the  question then is what are the incentives from  this day on; for people to get on that boat, take  a real risk with their lives, to turn up in

Australia, just to go to Malaysia?.

GILBERT: But there's been a shift in tone from the

Government as well on this.

EMERSON: I think that there's general community

consensus on this…

GILBERT: The sort of realise … sort of realisation that

your other policy just simply didn't work.

EMERSON: I think there's a general consensus on this:

that neither political party wants to see people  risking their lives on these dangerous  journeys. What we need to do is to break the  people smugglersÃ¢ÂÂ model and that's what this  is designed to do.

GILBERT: Politically, the ideal scenario for the

Government would be to have this off the  agenda, wouldn't it; just to not be having to  discuss this issue, because it's been such a  weakness for Labor for so long?

EMERSON: Well, again, we have consistently said that we

don't want people arriving by boat, making that  risky journey, risking their lives as we saw late  last year, losing their lives. And that's not the  first time in the last decade or so that asylum  seekers have lost their lives. This has not  been an issue marked by partisan support.  However, I think it is true of all political parties  that we don't want to see people making that  risky journey and losing their lives.

GILBERT: And obviously no bipartisan support on this

issue. In fact, you don't even have the support  of the Greens. Let's hear Senator Hanson-Young, the Greens spokesperson. She was on  Late Agenda - spoke to Helen Dalley last  night.

[Start of excerpt - interview with Senator Sarah

Hanson-Young]

SARAH HANSON-YOUNG: How are these protections going to be  implemented and overseen? And what  happens if there is a breach of these

protection mechanisms? What happens if  children, who we're seeing there, are not going

4



to get the protections that in this document  we're being asked to believe will happen.

[End of excerpt]

GILBERT: Senator George Brandis with us now from

Brisbane.

Senator Brandis, this is an argument similar to

what Scott Morrison's been making as well,  that the government can't guarantee protection  of the asylum seekers once in Malaysia. But  more broadly, if the government stops the  boats - it's already slowed the boats - if it stops  the boats, the Coalition will have to accept that  this was a successful policy.

BRANDIS: Well, a couple of points there Kieran. First of

all, the Government hasn't slowed the boats.  Let's put this into the context that this is a  problem of the Labor Party's own making. And  so I heard Craig Emerson crying crocodile  tears about the fate of asylum seekers. The  fact is that it's almost three years since the  Government abandoned the tough policies of  the Howard Government, which had solved  the problems.

In six years, until the tough policies of the

Howard Government were abandoned, there  were only 18 boat arrivals, an average of three  a year. The problem had become negligible.  But this Government, the Labor Party, didn't  have the policy courage to stick with those  tough policies. They re-opened the floodgates  of the people smugglers. And in the years  since we've had about 150 boats arrive. We,  today, have more than 5,000 people in  detention, including some 1,000 children.

5



So, you know, the crocodile tears don't wash

with me, given that this is a problem that the  Labor Party created. It replaced a solution with  a problem.

Now in relation to what Senator Hanson-

Young has said - what Senator Hanson-Young  has said is no different from what Andrew  Metcalfe, the Secretary of the Immigration  Department, told a Senate Estimates hearing  about two months ago. And don't forget,  Kieran, that although the politicians go to the  signing ceremonies and make the

announcements, the details of these  agreements are negotiated at an officialsÃ¢ÂÂ  level.

Mr Metcalfe, the Secretary of the Department,

who was primarily responsible for this  negotiation, said without any hesitation, Ã¢ÂÂthere  is no capacity to enforce Australian law in  MalaysiaÃ¢ÂÂ. That once … that if this deal were to  be done, these asylum seekers would be  subject to Malaysian law, just like everybody  else in Malaysia.

GILBERT: I will … I'll ask…

BRANDIS: And there is no enforcement capacity at all.

GILBERT: I'll ask the Minister about that in a moment.

But let me ask you just another thing on the  broader issues Senator Brandis. If the  Government can lock in a deal with Papua  New Guinea - they're still in talks with PNG -  and get a substantial regional approach to this  problem which, of course, is cross-border in its  nature, that would be … that would be a  success rather than the one-off unilateral  policy that the Coalition had with Nauru.

6



BRANDIS: Well, you know, I think one thing that after

nearly four years of Labor Government the  Australian people are well used to, is you  judge this Government by their performance,  not by their promises. The performance of this  Government on border security has been  lamentable. As I said before, a 100 …  approximately 150 boats have arrived in the  last three years.

There is a solution available: the Nauru

solution, which worked for the Howard  Government, and it is … in which the people,  the refugees, would be in immensely more  favourable circumstances than the risks to  which they are being exposed in Malaysia.

But it …  merely because of the stubbornness

and wilful pride of this Prime Minister…

GILBERT: Okay.

BRANDIS: …not to … not to be seen to be admitting that

the Howard Government got it right. That  obvious solution is not being considered.

GILBERT: Is Nauru … is it anything but Nauru, this

policy, as Senator Brandis is alluding to there.  And the other question that he put - I think it's  a fair question:  what can the Government do  once the asylum seekers are on Malaysian  soil? There's only … there's very little the  Government can do to ensure that the deal  done yesterday is going to be in force?

EMERSON: One of the defining features of this deal is the

involvement of the United Nations High  Commission for Refugees. Now, George has  just said Ã¢ÂÂwell, you know, Nauru was

7



completely humaneÃ¢ÂÂ. The United Nations High  Commission for Refugees, when Nauru  closed, actually said Ã¢ÂÂthis ends an unfortunate  chapter in Australia's treatment of asylum  seekersÃ¢ÂÂ. The United Nations High

Commission for Refugees never supported the  so-called Pacific Solution. It was expensive  and people were left there for very, very long  periods of time with impacts on their…

GILBERT: They actually don't support …

EMERSON: …mental health.

GILBERT: Their support for this plan isn't outright, either.

They'd rather the Government … they've said  they'd rather the Government process the  asylum seekers here. So their support for this  …

EMERSON: Look, they…

GILBERT: … is lukewarm as well.

EMERSON: All I'm saying is they are co-operating with the

Australian Government on the Malaysian deal.  They did not co-operate with the Coalition  Government. They actually criticised the  Coalition Government. So much for George's  sense of humanity.  And by the way,

something in the order of 70 per cent-plus of  those who went to Nauru ended up in Australia  anyway.

So there was a so-called “Pacific Solution”, to

a regional problem. What we are seeking and  we are obtaining is a regional solution to a  regional problem. That's what we've  consistently said.

GILBERT: David Speers, my colleague, spoke to Chris

Bowen yesterday after the announcement in  Malaysia, and about one of the back-flips that  the Government has undertaken in the last 24  hours: and that is to process the 500 or so  asylum seekers that have arrived here in the  last couple of months, in Australia, and not in a  third country.

This was the Minister in response to that.

[Start of excerpt - interview with Chris Bowen]

CHRIS BOWEN: It's a change of position, but it's the

appropriate thing to do; the only responsible  decision. Papua New Guinea, it's well known  we've been in discussions with them. They  have taken longer than people might have  expected, but the Malaysian arrangement, we  thought, was very clear. We agreed with  Malaysia that it's appropriate we send a neat  and clear signal that from today the next 800  arrivals are liable to this arrangement.

[End of excerpt]

GILBERT: Chris Bowen talking to us from Malaysia late

yesterday.

Senator Brandis, given the Government is

wanting to pursue that PNG option, is this  really a hanging offence, the fact that they've  decided to process those asylum seekers  here? It was the only real option, wasn't it?

BRANDIS: Well I don't think that's right at all. I mean the

fact is that the Government's policy has been  mired in confusion and back-flips from start to  finish on this. And I heard what Craig Emerson

9



had to say about Nauru. The fact is that Julia  Gillard, in one of the many twists and turns in  the argument that she is… in the position is  trying to maintain, said Ã¢ÂÂwell, look, we can't  send asylum seekers to Nauru, because  Nauru is not a party to the Refugee

ConventionÃ¢ÂÂ. But neither is Malaysia. And what  Craig Emerson said before is quite misleading.  This arrangement has not been endorsed by  the UN High Commissioner for Refugees …

EMERSON: I said, George…

BRANDIS: The UN High Commissioner … the UN High

Commissioner for Refugees…

EMERSON: Don't misquote me.

BRANDIS: Well you said…

EMERSON: Don't misquote me.

BRANDIS: … you said that the UN High Commissioner

for Refugees…

EMERSON: I said that the United Nations High

Commission…

BRANDIS: …has been involved in this process…

EMERSON: George, don't misquote me, as you do every

week. What I said…

BRANDIS: Craig …

EMERSON: … is that the United Nations High Commission

for Refugees is working with the Australian

10



Government on this matter. The United  Nations High Commission for Refugees  condemned, condemned the so-called Pacific  Solution. That's a big difference, George.

BRANDIS: Let's … let's get this straight. Let's get this …

let's get this straight. When you use those  weasel words Craig, “working with the  Australian Government…”

EMERSON: “Condemned” is a strong word.

BRANDIS: “…working with the Australian Government”,

the UN High Commissioner for Refugees has  not endorsed this deal. And if you saw their  spokesman on Lateline last night, she has  very serious reservations about it; about its  human rights consequences; about its  consistency with the Refugee Convention to  which, as I said before, Malaysia is not a party;  and as to its operability. So please don't try  and invoke the UN High Commission for  Refugees…

EMERSON: And Scott Morrison … and Scott Morrison

advocated an Iran solution, on the basis that  Iran is a signatory to the Refugee Convention.  Now you talked earlier George about how  Australian laws wouldn't apply in Malaysia.  Well I can tell you…

BRANDIS: Well they don't.

EMERSON: …this: they wouldn't apply in Iran, that's for

sure. So …

BRANDIS: Look, the fact…

11



EMERSON: … much for Scott Morrison's creative thinking.

So much for Tony Abbott's deep concern  about …

GILBERT: Okay, let's…

EMERSON: …asylum seekers…

GILBERT: …let's give Senator Brandis a quick response.

EMERSON: … where he actually said to Andrew Wilkie

he'd double the humanitarian intake. And  when we say we'll take an extra 1,000 a year,  he says this is a really dud deal.

GILBERT: Craig, we've got to go to a break. Just Senator

Brandis quickly - your response to that?

BRANDIS: Well, I think what we're hearing from Craig is

an attempt to paper over the fact that this is a  non-solution. It's limited to 800 people. It's …  there is no capacity of the Australian

Government to enforce it. Australian law… the  writ of Australian law doesn't run in Malaysia,  indeed in any other country. So what we're  depending upon is the goodwill and good faith  of a Malaysian minister who happens to be in  power at the moment and in the nature of  things one day will no longer be in power.

This is a shocking position of peril in which to

place these people.

GILBERT: Okay. We've got to take a break. We'll be right

back. Stay with us on AM Agenda.

[Unrelated item - advertisement break]

GILBERT:  Welcome back to AM Agenda.

In the wake of the Norway tragedy, the

Australian Christian Lobby is calling for a  crackdown on violent video games. I spoke to  the Christian Lobby managing director, Jim  Wallace, earlier this morning.

[Start of excerpt - previous interview with Jim

Wallace]

Jim Wallace, thanks for your time, off the back

of this…

JIM WALLACE: Thanks Kieran.

GILBERT: … tragedy in Norway. What are you calling

for? You're calling for some games to be  banned; for tougher restrictions? What exactly  do you want?

WALLACE: Yeah, we already have a situation, Kieran,

where we have games which should not be in  there, because of the gratuitous violence in  them, slipping into MA15.

And if we are going to increase the likelihood

of those games being available - and

remember this Modern Warfare 2 that this man  claimed was the best simulation he had in  preparation for what he did - this Modern  Warfare 2 is already there, available at MA15,  which it should never be. Because this game  has, for instance, a scenario - and as soon as I  heard the reports of the victims who said that  this man walked around methodically, just  shooting people as if they were not human-beings; he'd clearly dehumanised them - this  was exactly what you see the shooter do in

13



this airport theme of Modern Warfare 2, where  he even goes to the point of shooting …  pumping bullets into people who are clearly  wounded, you know.

GILBERT: But isn't there conjecture as to what sort of

impact a game would have on someone that  was clearly deranged already?

WALLACE: Yeah, I suggest to you that the weight of

professional opinion is very much in favour of  there being a connection. We have the  American Psychological Association, the  American Paediatrics … or Academy of  Paediatrics. And we had - and I presented this  at the standing committee for Attorney  Generals only last December - that we have  112 signatories of professionals and  academics in the field, from right around the  world, who have said there is a link, you know;  who have said, among other things - and this  really resonates when you think of what  happened in Norway - that it desensitises  people to violence, you know. It dehumanises  people.

GILBERT: But did you want the games … do you want

the games banned outright, or given a tougher  classification, or do you want them…

WALLACE: I want them … I want them…

GILBERT: … gone altogether?

WALLACE: No. I want the games banned, or those parts

of them that contain gratuitous violence. Those  parts of them that provide the training  simulation for someone as deranged as this  man in Norway, again, will be taken out, you

14



know. I mean it's just a nonsense for the  games industry to suggest that if this is done  suddenly people will stop gaming. What we've  got to do is we've got to provide the games,  but we've got to make sure that the games are  acceptable in a civil society.

GILBERT: You're a former …

[End of excerpt]

Jim Wallace there from the Australian

Christian Lobby.

Senator George Brandis - and Craig

Emerson's with me here as well - Senator  Brandis, tell me what do you make of what Jim  Wallace had to say there. Are you sympathetic  to his views?

BRANDIS: Well let me make a couple of points Kieran.

First of all I haven't seen the game that Jim  Wallace has been describing, so I obviously  reserve any comment about that specific  instance.

I've got a degree of sympathy with what Jim

Wallace has to say. I think that although my  natural disposition is against censorship, we  do have a classification system which the  Opposition supports. And that classification  system includes the .. a … the capacity of the  Classification Authority to refuse release in the  case of extremely violent video games, or  games that are otherwise so out of keeping  with community standards that they ought not  to be released.

15



Now how the authority applies that standard to

individual games, really you have to look at it  on a case-by-case basis. But, finally, let me  make this final point: that the terrible events  that happened in Norway were, as far as I can  see, an act of cold-blooded political terrorism.  This man was … behaved as much like … as  a terrorist, as much as the people who blew up  the London Underground of some years ago,  or the Madrid train bombers, were political  terrorists.

He sought to use violence in a deliberate,

purposeful, cold-blooded way in order to  achieve political outcomes. So I wonder - you  know, these events always have many causes  - but I wonder whether in this particular  instance the availability of a video game was  the proximate cause, or whether the cause  was, in fact, that this man, in a cold-blooded  and wilful way, decided to commit an act of  terrorism.

GILBERT: Trade Minister Emerson, what do you think

about this idea of the Government being more  vigilant on violent video games? And also Bob  Brown calling for a restriction on hand guns -  tougher laws on Glock pistols and so on.

EMERSON: Congratulations to George Brandis, in what

he's just said. I absolutely agree with him and  this was an act of terrorism. And to see those  young children lose their lives, it was just  appalling … absolutely appalling.

On the video game issue, the Justice Minister,

on behalf of the Gillard Government, is  seeking state agreement on an 18-plus  classification for violent games. And George is

16



right that, you know, there is capacity to ban  extremely violent games.

Thank you George for describing this man as

a terrorist - because he is. I don't care what a  person's ideology is, if they, for their warped  beliefs, go around killing people, including very  young people like this, they are terrorists and  they are damn bastards for doing it.

GILBERT: And what about the idea of a ban to  … a ban

on semi-automatic pistols? This is something  being pushed by Senator Brown of the  Greens; also the National Coalition for Gun  Control arguing, today, that there should be a  ban on semi-automatic pistols.

EMERSON: Yeah, look, I'd take that on notice. I'm aware of

that proposal. Again, while I'm in the mode of  congratulating Coalition members,

congratulations to John Howard for what he  did on gun control. I think it was in 1997,  following the Port Arthur massacre. So look, I  think…

GILBERT: But you'd be open to the idea of Glock pistols,

for example, tougher rules on that?

EMERSON: Yeah, it would be wrong for me to make a

determination on that here. Just suffice to say  that I think the use of weapons that enable  people to commit mass murder, in the name of  religion - whether it's Christianity, or Islam or  any other religion - is a terrible thing. And that  to see these young people lose their lives  because they actually had a belief in

fashioning a better world, a more decent  world, is just horrible and it was an act of  cowardly terrorism.

17



And I finally say this: we should not give any

publicity to this bloke who did this, because  that's what he wants. He wants to stand up  and share his crazed, violent ideology with the  world; seeking to convert them to his bizarre,  vicious cause, and we should not give him that  satisfaction.

GILBERT: Craig Emerson and Senator Brandis,

appreciate that.
