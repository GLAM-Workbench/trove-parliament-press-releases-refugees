Subject: Kevin Rudd’s visit to Papua New Guinea, Manus Island, polls

E and OE

MORRISON:

Once again Kevin Rudd has got on another plane, he has gone to another meeting,  he’s talked some more and all he’s come back with is more talk when it comes to  border protection.  It seems to me that the more Kevin Rudd gets on planes and  keeps talking, all we get is more boats turning up.  That seems to be the outcome  each time he comes.  He went to Papua New Guinea talking up a deal with Papua  New Guinea and all he’s ended up with is more talk. Maybe we should have a no fly  zone for Kevin Rudd because every time he seems to get on a plane all he turns up  with is nothing and just more talk. As the boats keep arriving we see again today the  announcement of yet another one that this time got within sight of the coast of  Broome.  This has been a prolific period of arrivals yet again under this government.   Kevin Rudd is on track to beat even Julia Gillard’s record for the most arrivals in a  month with people turning up at the rate of almost 1,000 per week.  In the last five  days we’ve had eight boats carrying almost 900 people.  We had three boats turn up  on one day with almost 350 people on board and of course we had that terrible  tragedy last week which is amongst those that arrived over this period of time.  Now  at the rate of arrivals that we are seeing once again the prospect if this was  continued over the full term of a re-elected Rudd government we would have in  excess of 100,000 people turn up if Kevin Rudd was re-elected as Prime Minister  and you’d get him for the whole term according to the rules that he’s putting out  there, which would mean that that record of failure of being a soft touch for people  smugglers would continue to act as a magnet for the people smugglers to send  people to Australia.  Kevin Rudd has no policies in this area.  His only policy is to  keep getting on planes and committing to talk more and that’s not the response we  need to what is an increasingly urgent problem under his stewardship.  Kevin Rudd  likes to talk about it being everybody else’s problem; he likes to say it’s a regional  problem of people smuggling.  Well the region has a Rudd problem when it comes to  people smuggling and it was the Rudd decision to get rid of the policies that worked  all those years ago that has put the region in this very difficult problem today.  His

unilateral action to roll out the Rudd carpet to people smugglers is the reason the  region today is dealing with the consequences of his poor judgement, his poor  decision making and the fact that he is a soft touch for people smugglers.  So it really  I think does draw into focus the need for us to have the election solution when it  comes to border protection so Australians can decide finally to get the policies that  worked back on our borders rather than having more talk and more  flying from Kevin  Rudd that never delivers anything other than just more talk.

QUESTION:  Kevin Rudd says PNG and Australia remain committed to a regional asylum seeker  solution.  Are you surprised Rudd hasn’t made more of a concrete announcement at  this point?

MORRISON:

It was Kevin Rudd that talked up the big deal that would occur in Papua New Guinea  as he jetted off once again to talk up his credentials and yet again he’s walked out of  it with nothing but talk.  I mean, Kevin just talks endlessly about this topic but you  can’t talk the boats away, Prime Minister, you need to put in place firm policies that  have worked and will work and that’s what the Coalition stands ready to do if we’re  elected.

QUESTION:

Is there any hope that there will be a permanent detention facility built on Manus  Island?

MORRISON:

Well that remains for the Prime Minister to explain.  But what is important is that we  have people who implement offshore processing policies that believe in them.  This  is the problem with border protection and Kevin Rudd; he doesn’t believe in stronger  border protection policies.  That’s why he got rid of the John Howard policies at his  first attempt and failed attempt at being Prime Minister.  You can’t trust Kevin Rudd  to implement policies he doesn’t believe in.  He doesn’t believe the boats can be  stopped and that’s why it’s important that you can choose a party and a team led by  Tony Abbott that believe in these policies and believe that the boats can be stopped  because we’ve done it before and we know we can do it again.



QUESTION:  Would a Coalition government deliver a permanent detention facility on Manus  Island?

MORRISON:

It was the Coalition that put permanent detention facilities and processing facilities in  place particularly on Nauru on the last occasion and these are the policies we  believe in, together with turning boats back where it is safe to do so and restoring  temporary protection visas that deny those who come on boats permanent residency  and ultimately citizenship because of that form of visa and that when it’s safe to go  home, people can be sent home.  The government doesn’t believe in any of these  policies.  Kevin has no policies when it comes to border protection other than getting  on more planes and having more talks.

QUESTION:

Just a couple of questions on polling, can a Coalition government win given the  latest polls?

MORRISON:

Sorry I couldn’t hear the question.

QUESTION:

Just a couple of questions on polling, can a Coalition government win given the  latest polls?

MORRISON:

Well I’ll let others commentate on the polls, other than to say this.  We’ve seen the  Kevin Kardashian approach to politics over the last two weeks.  What Australia  needs is a Prime Minister who’s going to act rather than one that’s just going to walk  through shopping centres and get on planes and talk.  That’s the choice that’s there  for the Australian people.  So if Kevin Rudd is so confident he should call the election  and he should get on with it.



QUESTION:

Were you surprised [inaudible]?

MORRISON:

What we’ve seen is the sugar hit that has come from Kevin Rudd’s taking over the  leadership but you can’t run a government on sugar hits.  Kevin should decide  whether he’s going to campaign or he’s going to govern and it’s clear that he wants  to campaign so he should call that election so we can have the election solution on  our borders.  What’s clear is Kevin Rudd has no policies for the problem he has  created on our borders other than just talking more and more and more.  And he  should be held to account for that and he should be held to account for it by the  Australian people at a poll where people can decide the policies they want on our  borders.

QUESTION:

But why do you think Labor’s polling has improved, aside from that?

MORRISON:

I’ll let others commentate on that.  Our view is very strong when it comes to border  protection and that is the government has failed manifestly, completely and that  failure continues even more strongly under Kevin Rudd than even occurred under  Julia Gillard.  What you can be assured of as long as Kevin keeps flying and Kevin  keeps talking, the boats will keep coming.  Thanks for your time.
