MEDIA RELEASE MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS ALEXANDER DOWNER FA83           24 May 2002

VISIT TO INDONESIA

My visit to Jakarta from 23-24 May was another indication of the commitment of Australia and Indonesia to move forward towards a positive and realistic bilateral relationship.

During the visit I met again with my counterpart, Dr Hassan Wirajuda, as well as the Coordinating Minister for Political and Security Affairs, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, the Coordinating Minister for People’s Welfare, Jusuf Kalla, and the State Secretary and Cabinet Secretary, Bambang Kesowo.  We discussed foreign policy, strategic and cultural affairs, including the war on terrorism, illegal immigration, East Timor, our trade and investment relationship, and Indonesia’s efforts to resolve the conflict in Maluku.

Together with Dr Wirajuda, I attended the final session of the inaugural Australia-Indonesia Young Leaders’ Dialogue in Bogor.  The Dialogue, which the Prime Minister announced during his visit to Jakarta in February, brings together a new generation of leaders from `politics, business, the media, NGO, and academia from both countries to discuss key bilateral and regional matters.  Its objective is to contribute ideas aimed at building the bilateral relationship and strengthening people-to-people links.

The Dialogue is funded by the Australia-Indonesia Institute and organized by the Asia-Australia Institute at the University of New South Wales in conjunction with the Habibie Center in Jakarta.

The AII is an Australian government-funded institute established to develop relations between the people of Australia and Indonesia by promoting greater mutual understanding and expanding areas of contact and exchange.
