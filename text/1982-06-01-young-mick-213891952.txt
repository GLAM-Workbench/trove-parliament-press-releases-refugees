”IN OTHER W O R D S ” From: MICK YOUNG m . p . Shadow Minister for Immigration   and Ethnic Affairs

No. 3, June 1982

Editorial -ALP NATIONAL CONFERENCE

The 35th Biennial National Conference of the  Australian Labor Party will be held in Canberra,  5-9 July 1982. This Conference will review the  Party's platform. Following wide consultation

and discussion with groups from the community  and the Party, national policy committees have  prepared recommendations for the Conference.

In my capacity of Shadow Minister%for ImmigraÂ­ tion and Ethnic Affairs, I was of course a  member of the platform committee concerned with  this portfolio. I take this opportunity to

thank all those dedicated members of that comÂ­ mittee for the time and effort they gave to  coming up with recommendations that, hopefully,

reflect not only the aims of the Party but also  the wishes of the migrant and refugee communiÂ­ ties in our country.

I am now in a position to inform you of some of  the recommendations the immigration platform

2.

committee will be putting to the National Conference. These are that a Labor Government will

- establish a National Population Council to conÂ­  sider and make recommendations on the relationÂ­ ship between population growth, immigration, the  economy, and the quality of life;

- support immigration at a level which is consisÂ­ tent with the national interest and Australia's  humanitarian obligations;

- give high priority to family reunion;

- abolish maintenance guarantees;

- ally immigration policy with the future needs of  the labour market;

- accept refugees without discrimination, but place  greater emphasis on initiating or supporting  political settlements to ease the plight of  refugees;.

- rex'iew the Australian Citizenship Act to remove  present anomalies;

- review laws relating to deportation; .

- introduce efficient and speedy mechanism for the  recognition of overseas trade, technical and  professional qualifications;

- provide for comprehensive ethnic media  programming;

- assist ethnic communities to develop their own  cultural, educational and welfare projects;

- improve the access of non-English speaking people  to public service employment;

- promote the provision of bilingual government  information and interpreter services;

and under-represented in  the higher classifications  especially those leading  to permanency.

The Task Group concluded  that, despite the existÂ­  ence of a broad equal  employment opportunity  policy "there was no

systematic program  presently in existence to  ensure implementation of  this policy or to provide

the management ... with  guidance for development  of properly based equal  employment opportunity  programs for migrants".

There are, of course, no  formal barriers within  Commonwealth employment to

migrants having equality  of opportunity, but - so  the report patronisingly  states - they (the  migrants) often lack the

comprehension of the proÂ­ cess. Then, as an afterÂ­ thought, the report points  out that lack of underÂ­ standing and acceptance by  workmates and supervisors  may form an invisible

barrier.

When the report considers  the "merit principle" for  gaining access to public  service employment, it  fails to mention that  migrants are not given

credit for a whole range

of "merits" when they  apply for entry into the  service; e.g. language  skills, overseas experiÂ­ ence, etc.

I hope that the Public  Service Board will take  note of some of the less  explicit discrimination

that this report shows up  and acts on these  findings in the future.

AUSTRALIAN-GREEK  PRESIDENTIAL AWARDS

The Department of EmployÂ­  ment and Industrial  Relations announced on 3  June that Australians

aged between 15 and 30  years are now eligible  to apply for grants to  study or work in Greece

for up to 12 months.

A spokesman for the  Department said the  awards aimed "to foster  the maintenance and  development of Greek

culture within  Australia's multiÂ­ cultural society ...".

The awards were first  announced by the Prime  Minister in March in  honour of the visit to

I will try to attend personally as many of the public  forums as possible, and look forward to meeting -with  community representatives there.

MIGRANTS IN THE PUBLIC  SERVICE

The Commonwealth Government  has released a report on  the employment of migrants  in the Australian Public

Service and Commonwealth  Statutory Authorities. The report, which was  actually written in 1980,

is entitled "The CommonÂ­ wealth as an Employer of  Migrants".

It was prepared by an  Ethnic Liaison Officer Task  Group with representation

from 12 Commonwealth  Departments and  Authorities. Its 21 recomÂ­ mendations are claimed to

be directed towards ensurÂ­ ing that migrants have  equal access to employment  in the Commonwealth sphere  and equal opportunities  within Commonwealth

employment.

One of the problems with  such a study is what preÂ­ cisely is meant by  "migrant". The examples  of migrant public servants

cited in the Public

*  *  *

Service Board's Equal  Employment Opportunities  Newsletter seem to  indicate that, for a  migrant to "make it" in

the public service, he  or she has to be more  highly educated than

their Australian counterÂ­  parts in the same jobs. On the whole, they

appear to have been in  Australia for several  decades and speak

English as well as  several other languages  fluently.

Hence it comes as no  surprise that the report  has to admit that the  Australian public

service employs only 14%  of overseas born, comÂ­  pared with 27% overseas

born in the total workÂ­ force. Among these 14%  British migrants predomÂ­  inate to a far greater  extent than they do in  the total workforce.

Migrants are also disÂ­  tributed more unevenly  within the service: they  are concentrated in the

lower classifications

3.

- oppose all forms of racial discrimination and  provide proper and adequate machinery to deal  with such discrimination;

- be committed to a national language policy;  extend and improve the teaching of English as a  second language to children and adults; provide  for the study of community languages and  cultures for all Australians; act in conjunction  with employers to seek the establishment of

English courses for non-English speaking persons  at the work place during working hours;

- will, in accordance with our belief that responsÂ­ ibility for settlement services rests with the  Government, establish consultative machinery beÂ­ tween the States and the Federal Government to  determineÂ·^ the-3 evel of.immigration intake and of  Federal financial support to ensure the States  can provide adequate facilities, services and  opportunities for all new settlers;

- ensure that migrants have equal access to welfare  services;

- establish a tripartite committee consisting of  Government, management and unions to develop comÂ­ prehensive strategies to overcome the human  problems of a multicultural workforce, covering

such matters as language problems, safety  practices, workers compensation, recognition of  overseas qualifications, and problems associated  with unemployment and the exploitation of migrant  workers;  and

- support comprehensive exchange programs, particuÂ­ larly with countries from which migrants have  come to Australia.

In addition to the above, the committee dealing with  education has made the following recommendations:

Concerning the education of ethnic groups and multiÂ­  cultural education, a Labor Government, through the

4.

Education Commission,  will

- recognise the value of ethnic diversity within a  framework of democratic values and of sexual and  racial equality;

- recognise the special needs of ethnic minority  groups;

- promote equality of opportunity across ethnic  groups;

- provide special support for the teaching of  ethnic languages;

- provide in major population centres opportunities  for learning the languages of ethnic minority  groups;

- make provision for a diversified program of  English language teaching; and

- in all of the above, insist upon the maximum  participation of ethnic communities in the  development and implementation of policies. Â·

Naturally, all of these recommendations will have to  be passed by the National Conference, but it is my  sincere hope that with such a policy we will be able  to give the best possible service to ethnic communiÂ­

ties in Australia.

Whilst, in principle, the concept of "national conÂ­ sultation" seems a good one, because it opens up  the decision-making process to public scrutiny,  there is always the danger that it can be reduced  to mere tokenism. Obviously, the Government hopes  to enhance its popularity by being seen as consultÂ­

ing with the community on matters affecting them  directly. However, the Government must also be  seen to be acting on the views of those it consults.  Therefore, it is important for all of us not only to  put our views on citizenship to the Government, but .

also to monitor the Government’s progress in passing  the necessary legislation to make the present Act  more relevant to the times.
