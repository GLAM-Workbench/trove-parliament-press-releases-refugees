Transcript:                  Interview with Kieran Gilbert, Sky News PM Agenda

Main topic:                   Ministerial appointment





KIERAN GILBERT:        There was only one big winner and that is the former Labor leader,  Simon Crean.  I spoke to him a little earlier.

Simon Crean, thanks for your time.

First of all, congratulations on the new appointment.  Your job - the area that you're taking  over - there have been a lot of controversies surrounding the Building the Education  Revolution.

Is that your top priority when you start the new role?

SIMON CREAN:        Well I think the top priority, quite frankly Kieran, is ensuring that we  continue to build the solid foundations on which we value the importance of education as a  government.

It is the enabler for individual opportunity.  It's the enabler for ensuring that the nation  develops its skill needs going forward and getting the foundations for that right is the key  priority quite frankly, because nothing can be more important than ensuring that everyone  has the opportunity to a decent education and to recognise that lifelong learning becomes a  very important part of the equation.

KIERAN GILBERT:        Do you not feel that you're simply warming the seat given we're so  close to the next election?

SIMON CREAN:        Well we're certainly close to the next election.  How close remains to  be seen, but I can assure you, I've never been a seat warmer.

KIERAN GILBERT:        Well what about this portfolio though?  It's a super portfolio and the  Government was under pressure to break it up, but before Julia Gillard took the leadership  that she had too much on her plate, don't you think that this is asking too much of one  person?



SIMON CREAN:        Well I've held the position, the portfolio, for more than two and a half  years Kieran, of Employment, Education and Training.  Let's get that right to begin with.  I've  done that in a previous government.  I've also had a fair bit of experience in industrial  relations.

I don't believe the size of this portfolio and the overlap is going to daunt me one little bit.  It's  true that there are many challenges in this, but every portfolio one comes to has its  challenges.  The question is, how do we best respond to them and I will give it my best.  I  think I've shown my determination and persistence, my preparedness to get across the  detail to come up with some creative solutions when the [indistinct] appear.  I will apply that  same dedication, determination, persistence and creativity to all of the aspects of this  portfolio, but interestingly, Julia has laid an incredibly solid foundation, and so what I want to  do is to build upon that.

Now it's true,  the timetable going forward is very short.  I'm not looking beyond the election.   What I'm doing is looking for taking the agenda and reinforcing the importance of education  in the upcoming election, because if we get our message right, why these issues are  important then I think the public will respond positively to us and of course that's what we  have to achieve.

KIERAN GILBERT:        Okay.  You're very close to Julia Gillard, Mr Crean.  Why should  this not be seen as a reward for your friendship and loyalty?

SIMON CREAN:        Well nice try.  I - I'm close to her but I'm close to every leader.  I have  shown absolute loyalty through all of my time in whatever role that I've played.

Friendship comes with that loyalty if you deliver the loyalty, but I don't have any qualms at  all about the circumstances in which she has sought my willingness to fill this role and I'm  delighted to do it.

KIERAN GILBERT:        The polls show an immediate bounce for the new Prime Minister.     Do they vindicate the change of leadership?

SIMON CREAN:        Look, the change of leadership has happened.  We're not driven by  polls, we're driven by good policy.  I've been in parliament now over 20 years.  I didn't come  in to follow polls.  I came in to implement good policy, and every time I've had the  opportunity to apply myself to the development of that policy, I've grabbed it.  That's what  I'm looking forward to in this new role.  Polls or no polls, from me you'll get determination,

commitment to good policy.

KIERAN GILBERT:        Do you think there should be a role for Kevin Rudd in the Cabinet  post election if you do win?

SIMON CREAN:        The Prime Minister has clearly signalled that view.  I support her  judgement on this completely.

KIERAN GILBERT:        Last week in the lead-up to the challenge, you said that there  wasn't a challenge at play, that it was just - that it was just gossip and there was no  foundation to it.  What changed so quickly?

SIMON CREAN:        Well it did change quickly as you know.  I think you were reporting  how quickly the changes happened.  If anyone knows how quickly it changed Kieran, you  should know it.

But I came back to my office at 7 o'clock.  I was told that a newspaper - news report had  said the ballot was on - I knew nothing of it.  There had been no discussion with me and  that's the statement that I made.  I didn't have a discussion with Julia until much later that

evening, and the events just took over.

So I was not aware nor supportive of any challenge, but ultimately the talks that took place  between the two of them resulted in the challenge.  That's history.  Let's get on with the  future.

KIERAN GILBERT:        You know it's a tough game.  You've experienced the highs and the  lows yourself.  Did you feel for Kevin Rudd when you watched that news conference last  week?



SIMON CREAN:        Well not only that, I felt for him in the Caucus meeting and I said so.  I  said it directly to him at -  when he said he wasn't standing again.  It didn't surprise that he  made that decision, because that's precisely the same sort of judgement I had to make on a  previous occasion.

But of course I felt for him.  I felt not just sympathy, but empathy, great empathy.  These are  hard issues for leaders who have given a great deal to the nation.  He has done enormous  things for the country.  I believe history will treat him extraordinarily well and he deserves it.   But the situation has changed.  We move on.

KIERAN GILBERT:        Okay, just finally.  What is your advice to your friend and your  Prime Minister now as to what her focus needs to be, what her top priorities need to be to  mop up essentially before she goes to the polls?

SIMON CREAN:        Well clearly, we've got to sort out the mining tax and I think there are  important discussions continue to take place around that.  I think the positioning in terms of  climate change and the asylum seekers, they're the ones that everyone talks about.  I think

the statements she's been making so far clearly indicate that she's got a handle on all of  those, but I think most importantly Kieran, what we've got to get is a coherence in our  narrative.



This is a government that saved this nation from recession.  We are the envy of the world.   People want to know how we did it, what was different about us from other countries, and I  think we've got a great story to tell.

But we didn't just save the country from recession.  We set the nation up for prosperity and  we did it because much of the stimulus package didn't just go to consumption spending for  keeping the economy going, but investment in our future, investment in education,  investment in innovation, in skills and infrastructure.  These are the sorts of things that are  going to set the nation up for prosperity.  We've got to tell that message and we've also got  to tell the message that in setting a nation up for prosperity, the benefits have to be shared  fairly to the people of Australia, and that also is a great message we've got.

But most of all it's Labor as the builders of prosperity.   I believe our opponents have always  never understood - never properly understood the importance of building the basis for  prosperity and that's a distinction we're going to have to make, but it's very important for us  to get our narrative right because we have got a very good story to tell.

KIERAN GILBERT:        Simon Crean, appreciate your time.  Thank you very much.

SIMON CREAN:        My pleasure Kieran.
