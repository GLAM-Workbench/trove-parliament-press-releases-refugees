Border Protection Command intercepts vessel

ACV Triton, operating under the control of Border Protection Command, intercepted a  suspected irregular entry vessel west of Ashmore Islands late yesterday.

Initial indications suggest 43 passengers and three crew are on board.

The people will be transferred to Christmas Island where they will undergo security, identity  and health checks and their reasons for travel will be established.

While their nationality is yet to be confirmed, if these asylum seekers are Afghans, the  processing suspension introduced by the Government on 9 April 2010 will apply.

The Government yesterday announced a decision to end the suspension on processing claims  for Sri Lankan asylum seekers that was introduced on 9 April 2010. This decision was based  on a range of country information, including the revised UNHCR Eligibility Guidelines for  Sri Lanka, that confirmed the improving human rights and security situation in Sri Lanka and  that displaced people continue to return to their homes.
