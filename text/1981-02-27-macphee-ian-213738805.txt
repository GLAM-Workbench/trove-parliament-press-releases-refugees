LILIANA GASINSKAYA

The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Mr Ian Macphee,  said today that he had asked the D.O.R.S. (Determination of  Refugee Status) Committee to interview Miss Liliana Gasinskaya  next week.

This action was being taken in the light of reports that she  had visited the U.S.S.R. since being granted refugee status in  Australia.

Mr Macphee said that in 1979 the D.O.R.S. Committee had recommended  refugee status for Miss Gasinskaya under the provisions of the 1951  Convention relating to the Status of Refugees. Article 1(c)(1) of  that Convention states that "This Convention shall cease to apply  to any person who has voluntarily reavailed himself of the  protection of the country of his nationality".

If Miss Gasinskaya has either visited the U.S.S.R. or travelled  on a Soviet Passport there would be grounds for the Committee  to reconsider her status.
