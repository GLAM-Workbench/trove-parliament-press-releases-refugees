Oakeshott’s offshore processing bill is Malaysia deal in all but name: Greens

The proposed offshore processing bill announced by independent MP Rob Oakeshott is the  Malaysian solution in all but name, the Australian Greens said today.

“No amount of spin from Mr Oakeshott can cover the fact that in his noble attempt to play  peacemaker he is simply winding up doing the Government’s dirty work,” Greens’ immigration  spokesperson, Sen. Sarah Hanson-Young, said today.

“This bill is essentially no different than the Government’s Malaysia legislation as it strips away the  limited protections that exist in the Migration Act that the High Court said are important for asylum  seekers and which Australia must uphold.

“Mr Oakeshott’s bill would allow the government of the day to dump vulnerable asylum seekers and  refugee children in Nauru or Malaysia, exporting our humanity to another country without approval  by or the oversight of parliament.

“The Greens remain, again, the only members in parliament with a consistent position that  Australian’s treatment of asylum seekers must be humane and legally sound.

“The Greens will not support Mr Oakeshott’s bill and urge other MPs to reject it on the grounds of  human rights and the huge expense to tax payers of offshore processing.”
