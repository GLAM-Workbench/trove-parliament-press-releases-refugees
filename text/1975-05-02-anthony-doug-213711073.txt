MEDIA RELEASE: 2nd MAY 1975

NATIONAL COUNTRY PARTY OF AUSTRALIA

The following resolution was carried unanimously this

afternoon by a meeting of the Federal Council of the National

Country Party of Australia.

This Federal Council deplores the attitude of the

Australian Government in showing a bias towards the Communist

side in the Indo-China conflict, and calls on the Government

to reconsider its approach to the plight of refugees from

South Vietnam.

Council declares its support for the call by the Opposition

for the immediate return to Australia of the Prime Minister

to answer in Parliament the apparently well-founded allegations

made against him involving deception of the Parliament and

the Australian people, and the adoption by the Government of

double standards in its attitudes to the Communist and nonÂ­

Communist sides in Vietnam.

The Council expresses deep concern over what appears to

be a most serious breach by the Prime Minister, and believes

that, if he is unable to satisfactorily reassure the Parliament

and the people as to the correctness of his actions, he

should give serious consideration to his position as head of

government.

The Council urges the Government to adopt a much more

humanitarian attitude to the plight of refugees who have Â·

managed to escape from South Vietnam, and suggests that the

guidelines for admission of refugees to Australia be widened,

particularly so as to allow people who have been evacuated

to be reunited with members of their families already in

Australia, and to help those South Vietnamese who worked for

the Australian Embassy in Saigon.

The Council calls upon the Government to use the channels

it has established with Hanoi to urge the Communist authorities

to act with humanity and magnanimity towards those whose

lives it now controls.
