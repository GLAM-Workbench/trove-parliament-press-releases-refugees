TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER  THE HON JOHN HOWARD MP  DOORSTOP INTERVIEW   TOWNSVILLE, QUEENSLAND

Subjects:  Election campaign

E&OE…………………………………………………………………………………

PRIME MINISTER:

Well, ladies and gentlemen, this will be my last full news conference of this election  campaign and I do want to address a number of issues to those of my fellow  Australians who are still to make up their minds how to vote.  Can I say to them that if  you believe that our country is fundamentally heading in the right direction, you  should not vote for a change of government.  Because if you change the government,  you will change the fundamental direction of the country.  It always happens.  You

will alter its economic settings with consequences for the living standards of all  Australians.  So if you believe that our nation is fundamentally heading in the right  direction, there is no case for change.

I’m very proud of what the Coalition has done over the last eleven and a half years.   This nation of ours is prouder, stronger and more prosperous than it was eleven and a  half years ago.  We have laid out a plan to maintain that prosperity and strength for  years into the future.  We have, in the Coalition, the people with the experience, with

the track record, with the ideas and, importantly, with the strength to maintain the  prosperity of the Australian nation years into the future.

Can I also make the additional comment that if Labor wins tomorrow, for the first  time in the history of this country, we will have Labor Governments in power at every  level, both State and Federal.  And a Labor Government elected tomorrow will  become the least checked and balanced of any Federal Government this country has  had.  That will not be good for the accountability which is so important in a  Federation, and it will not be good for the governance of our country.

And can I also, because I’m here in Townsville, can I address some remarks  particularly to my fellow Australians who live in Queensland.  As I travel around the  great State of Queensland, I find overwhelmingly people want this country to remain  strong, they want it to remain optimistic and Queenslanders want an economy that’s

friendly to small business.  Queensland is the great small business State of Australia  because of its structure, the distribution of its population and the nature of its  economy, the contribution made by recreation and hospitality; the dispersed nature of  the Queensland population means that small business, more than any other part of  Australia, is central to the ongoing prosperity of this State and, therefore, any policies  that threaten the viability of small business - and Labor’s policies do - threaten the  economic prosperity and strength of the State of Queensland.  Queenslanders want to  maintain the prosperity they now have.  They want it to remain a friendly State for  small business, and that can be achieved through a return of the Coalition.

Any questions?

JOURNALIST:

Some of the newspapers have come out against you and some for you. What are your  thoughts on that, and will you go seeking payback against the ones if you win?

PRIME MINISTER:

Certainly not.  I mean, I read editorials sometimes.  I think people make up their own  minds, and the Australian people will make up their own minds, but I’m not into  payback.  I think you have found, in my dealings with you over the years, that whilst I  strongly disagree with positions taken by some journalists and newspapers, I’m not  into the payback business.  That’s the stock-in-trade of the Australian Labor Party.

JOURNALIST:

Mr Howard, visiting seats like Leichhardt on the day before the election with a ten per  cent margin is that a desperate move, does show that you’re desperate?

PRIME MINISTER:

No, I don’t think it’s desperate to spend the last day or the last 24 hours of the  campaign in Queensland, which I’ve done.  I’ve visited Blair, I visited Bonner, I  visited Moreton, I visited Leichhardt, I’m now in the seat of Herbert and I think you’ll  find me in a couple more before the day is through.  And I have deliberately come to  Queensland for the last day because I want to appeal directly to the people of  Queensland, to remind them of the benefits in this State of a strong economy and the  lethal impact Labor’s bringing back the unfair dismissal laws will have on the  viability and prosperity of many small businesses in Queensland.

JOURNALIST:

Mr Rudd, Mr Howard, has done an interview where he said he doesn’t believe in  pursuing a referendum on Aborigines having a special place in the Constitution, he’ll  turn back boats, he said.

PRIME MINISTER:

He said he doesn’t believe in referendums.

JOURNALIST:

Well, he won’t push for it.

PRIME MINISTER:

No, no.  But I thought he agreed with it a few weeks ago.

JOURNALIST:

Well, this is what I’m asking.  Do you think this agenda that he’s set out, which is  against symbolism I suppose and taking a hard line on asylum seekers, is that to cover  up certain weaknesses on his front?



PRIME MINISTER:

Well, once again, you should look at what Labor has done when they’ve been put to  the fire.  When they were put to the fire on asylum seekers, they were weak.  When  they were put to the fire on the Pacific solution, they were against it.  When they were  put to the test on excising islands to protect our borders, they were against it.  I’m  very unconvinced by an election eve statement by Mr Rudd, and in relation to the  referendum, I thought Mr Rudd said a few weeks ago that he agreed with it, and he  seems to be changing his position.  I mean, you wonder in these matters, does he  really believe in anything?



JOURNALIST:

Prime Minister, should Queensland voters look beyond the fact that Kevin Rudd is  Queensland born and bred and so is the Shadow Treasurer?

PRIME MINISTER:

I think the people of Queensland should look to the interests of Australia, and also to  the interests of Queensland, and the interests of both Australia and Queensland are  served by maintaining a strong economy and I have always, in the time I’ve been  Prime Minister, spent a great deal of time in this State.  I think I’ve probably visited  Cairns on about 16 occasions and Townsville about the same in the time I’ve been  Prime Minister.  And, in the end, it’s not where you live, it’s what you believe in.  It’s  not where your address is, but rather what you’re prepared to do when you’re really  put to the test.  And I can say to the Australian people, we have done things - this  country is stronger and prouder and more prosperous because of what we have done.   We say to the Australian people we’ve got the men and women to deliver the best  years yet to this nation and they’ve got experience, they’ve got strength and they’ve  got ideas and plans in order to do that.

JOURNALIST:

Mr Howard, do you feel that more voters now are flirting with the prospect of  change?

PRIME MINISTER:

I beg your pardon?

JOURNALIST:

Do you feel as though your voters now are feeling more enthusiastic about your  message and flirting less with the idea of change?

PRIME MINISTER:

Look, I have certainly found, especially in the last 24 hours - I found it last night and I  found it this morning, a lot of enthusiasm for the Coalition, a lot of enthusiasm for our  candidates, for Charlie McKillop and of course for Peter Lindsay the Member for

paradise who is a wonderfully popular member here.  I do find that there is something  of a flowback if I can put it that way, we’ll all of course know tomorrow, but what I  am saying to people and what I say again in answer to your question that if you  believe this country is fundamentally going in the right direction you shouldn’t  change the government, because if you change the government you will alter that  fundamental direction, you’ll compromise it, you’ll alter the economic settings and

there’ll be consequences for the living standards of Australians and that, when I get  the opportunity, that is a message I address to my fellow Australians.

JOURNALIST:

Mr Howard, Kevin Rudd’s pledge to…

PRIME MINISTER:

I’m sorry could you speak up.

JOURNALIST:

Kevin Rudd has pledged to end what he calls a culture of secrecy surrounding your  Government by doing things like holding a press conference after every Cabinet  meeting, I think touring the Cabinet once a month in regional areas like in Queensland  and Western Australia.  What would a re-elected Howard Government do to raise  levels for accountabilities to the public?

PRIME MINISTER:

Well I don’t think anybody would say that I have been an unavailable Prime Minister.   I mean it’s very interesting that Mr Rudd is promising scrutiny and accountability in  Government, but he’s avoided it and set out to avoid it during the election campaign.   There’s a conflict.  I mean Mr Rudd during this election campaign has made an art  form of avoiding direct scrutiny, I mean I have no objection to him, he can go on any

4

programs he likes, I go on a whole variety of programs, but Mr Rudd has deliberately  avoided a lot of the programs where there’s a fair amount of additional scrutiny. I  mean it is odd that the alternative Prime Minister of this country in this election  campaign has chosen not to go on the Insiders program.  Now, I don’t always agree  with what the Insiders have said, as you know, but at least it has to be said of that  program that it is a very dedicated, serious Federal political program.  Now I think it  passes strange that having behaved like that, you then ask the people to believe the  complete opposite if you happen to be elected, I mean it’s a bit like behaving not as a  fiscal or economic conservative when you’re actually asked to vote but saying I am an  economic conservative.  I mean it really raises question marks about his sincerity.  I

have had a lot of news conferences, as you all know, I’ve had them in this campaign,  I’ve had them as Prime Minister, I’ve had very open relations with the media in the  whole time that I’ve been Prime Minister and I’ll continue to do that if I am re-elected.  Yes Paul.

JOURNALIST:

You said yesterday that you believed you could win…

PRIME MINISTER:

Yes.

JOURNALIST:

The bookies have you well behind in a two-horse race…

PRIME MINISTER:

Yes.

JOURNALIST:

What makes you…

PRIME MINISTER:

Have they closed their books yet?

JOURNALIST:

Not yet.  What makes you…

PRIME MINISTER:

No they should keep them open, they should keep them open until six o’clock  tomorrow night.





5

JOURNALIST:

What makes you believe you can win?  Do you know something we don’t?

PRIME MINISTER:

Meeting people, talking to them, looking them in the face, looking at their reactions.   I’ve been doing this for a long time and I know when I’m struggling and I know when  I’m well in front, and I know when I could be coming back.

JOURNALIST:

Mr Howard, do you think there’s a phenomenon though…

PRIME MINISTER:

Beg your pardon?

JOURNALIST:

Do you think there’s a phenomenon though because you’re the Prime Minister and  you’re well known around the country that people want to see you, want to shake your  hand because you know you’re the Prime Minister, but then walk away as we found in  some cases - I’m not going to vote for him but I wanted to shake his hand.  Do you  think that…

PRIME MINISTER:

Well look that is true, the celebrity thing is true with anybody in my position, and but  I compare this with other election campaigns when I’ve been equally well-known as  Prime Minister.  I mean I was well known before I became Prime Minister, because  I’d been Opposition Leader and I’d been Treasurer, so I’m not a complete unknown  so I’ve, there’s an element of that but the response of which I speak is different again  to that. Yes Ashleigh.

JOURNALIST:

Can you clarify that voters of Bennelong once and for all if you lose the election but  win your seat, how long until you retire?

PRIME MINISTER:

Look Ashleigh, I am not going to hypothesise about defeat.  I am wanting to win and  my every waking hour is directed towards persuading people to support the  Government, so I’m therefore not going to hypothesise about defeat, I’ve said and I  repeat now that if the Government is returned I will serve my full term in Bennelong.   Paul.

JOURNALIST:

Prime Minister, Mr Rudd’s told the Australian newspaper that a Labor Government  under him will turn around asylum seekers, in seaworthy vessels, in international  waters. Given Labor’s position on the several incidents that have happened in the  past, do you think he’s lying?

PRIME MINISTER:

Well, he is unconvincing. I’m not going to use the other word, but he is unconvincing,  and why he’s unconvincing is once again they have not behaved in a supportive,  cooperative way when we have done these things. They have sniped from the  sidelines, they snipe from the sidelines and they blocked excision when they had the  numbers in the Senate. They have opposed the Pacific solution; they have derided the  Pacific solution. I mean, I can respect a principled opposition, consistently held, to  our attitude to asylum seekers, I don’t agree with it, I don’t think it’s in the interests of  Australia, but Mr Rudd, on the eve of the election, is trying to have it both ways. He is  - what he said today was totally inconsistent with the stances that his party’s taken in

the past. That’s my point.

JOURNALIST:

You underscored the importance of your press conference at the beginning, the last  one of your campaign. The opening statement you chose to make was about the  problem of all Labor Governments around the country.



PRIME MINISTER:

Yes.

JOURNALIST:

The problem of Labor’s effect on the economy, you stand in front of don’t risk our  economy with Labor. Isn’t Kevin Rudd justified in saying the message you want to  sell is overwhelmingly negative?

PRIME MINISTER:

No, he’s not justified because I also spoke of the great strength, the great prosperity  and the great pride there is in Australia over the last 11 and a half years. In fact, that  was my opening statement. My opening statement was a positive assertion of what my  Government has done. My opening statement was that this is a stronger, prouder more  prosperous country than 11 and half years ago, and that is still my strongest claim for

re-election, that we have done the job. We haven’t been perfect, but we have been a  Government that has brought the Australian economy to a record level of strength.

By any measurement, this economy is performing in a remarkable fashion.  Unemployment at a 33 year low, debt paid off, four per cent or more annual growth,  seen by the OECD as a model economy and it’s not as if we haven’t had to contend  with adversity over the last 11 and a half years. We had the Asian economic  downturn, we had SARS, we had the end of the tech bubble, we have the backwash of

7

the terrorist attack in 2001 and we also had an obstructive Opposition, of which Mr  Rudd was a senior member, who voted against all of our major reforms. As an  Opposition, Labor did not display the responsibility that we displayed when we were  in Opposition about important reforms.



JOURNALIST:

Mr Howard, do you worry…

PRIME MINISTER:

Can we have, just to give a…

JOURNALIST:

Do you have any regrets about this campaign? Have you made any mistakes?

PRIME MINISTER:

Look, I’m now into retrospectives of the campaign. I’m still talking to people who  haven’t made up their minds how to vote and if you’re speaking on their behalf in any  way, or through you, I just remind them again of just how important it is if you  believe the country’s heading in the right direction, not to risk and it is a risk, if you  change a government when the country is heading in the right direction,  fundamentally, you run the risk that it will stop heading in the right direction,  fundamentally. I’ll have one more question from somebody - no, one more question  from Allison, isn’t it?

JOURNALIST:

Thanks Prime Minister. This morning your favourite Sydney paper called on the  people of Sydney to vote Labor. Given that the Daily Telegraph is the people’s paper  and represents the people’s views, are you concerned that Sydney has turned its back?



PRIME MINISTER:

Look I love all Australians in all cities. Of course I love Sydney, but no one  newspaper ever speaks for the soul of a city. The only people who speak for the soul  of a city are the people who live in it and in the end the people of Sydney, like the  people of Perth or Townsville or Cairns or Brisbane, will decide and I just say to all of  them, if they’re undecided, if you like the direction in which the country is heading,  don’t risk a change of Government because you’ll alter that direction. Thank you.
