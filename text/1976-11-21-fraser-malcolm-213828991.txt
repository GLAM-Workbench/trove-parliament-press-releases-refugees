ELECTORATE TALK

Australians who believe in the right of elected Governments   to make decisions that affect the welfare of each citizen   will applaude the Victorian Government’s decision to proceed   with the Neivport Power Station.

It is a question of who controls the vital power supplies   for Melbourne and the rest of Victoria.

The Federal Government supports Mr Hamer's stand, and it's   clear that his government's resolution in this matter has   won wide support throughout the State. '

Mr Hamer has been most patient, reasonable and very willing to   listen to argument on this issue. The question of union   activities in the area of vital services has been canvassed   in other parts of Australia over the past week or so.

Mr Wran has. indicated a real degree of frustration with what has been happening in New South Wales. Clearly, this question is not just confined to one side of the political arena.

Governments from both political views are thoroughly fed up   with being held to ransom by a few militant union leaders.

I believe also that the great bulk of the trade union movement   has become disillusioned with the irresponsibility of a few   union officials who are often in communist dominated unions.

Our secret postal ballot legislation, in operation since August,   places a powerful weapon in the hands of union members,  who   become convinced that the actions of their union are contrary   to their own interests. .

Most trade unionists know that no section of the community can   adopt attitudes, or try and force attitudes, in isolation from   the rest of the community,  without causing lasting harm.

People rightly demand that both business and unions recognise .   that they are part of a community, and that they must be   concerned with the^impact of their actions upon other people in   that community.

Today,  unions and management have clearly defined social  responsibilities..  Union responsibilities extend much beyond  wage issuesÂ·for their members.  Management responsibilities  extend much beyond providing a place of employment.

Rejection of unreasonable strikes of all kinds - from political  strikes to strikes that come from inter-union disputes -  are part of the trade union movement's social responsibility.

These strikes do nothing more than raise costs, inhibit production   and destroy job opportunities.

But their responsibilities go further.  For example,  union   journals are almost invariably published in English. This   happens despite the large numbers of non-English speaking   employees in many industries.

Until the union movement does more to close this information   gap between themselves and their migrant members, they can hardly   claim to be adequately representing those members.

Managements, too, have an equal responsibility. Only a few   employers, for example,  provide multi-lingual information on   award provisions, working conditions, and company information   for migrant workers. The lack of multi-1ingual safety signs   could also.well contribute to industrial accidents among   migrant workers.

The needs of other disadvantaged minorities - working mothers,   youth and Aboriginals - must also be considered in a practical   way by unions and management. Ã¢ÂÂ

Government, of course, has significant responsibilities in   these areas.  We have taken positive and effective action in   these areas,  but much can be done by unions and management   who have the. will to help. i Â· Â· :  -  .

The Government looks for future signs, from both unions and   management, that they will recognise the great social responsibility   they must bear if this nation is to prosper as we would all want.

This week the Government made a significant decision that will   provide for more effective management of the business of   Government - particularly in relation to the national economy.

The Government announced that the financial management activates   of the Treasury Department will be separated from its role as   an economic policy analysis and advice source.

In future the financial management and control functions will   be carried out by a newly created Department of Finance. In effect,  the decision means that more concentrated attention   will be given to budget management,  development of forward

estimating, the analysis of economic issues and the creation   of economic strategy.  .
