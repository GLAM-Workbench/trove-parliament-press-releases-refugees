AUSTRALIA AND THE UNITED NATIONS

Address to Che 43rd General Assembly of the United Nations by  Senator Gareth Evans,  Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, New  York, 4 October,  1988

I warmly congratulate you, Mr President, on your election to  the important post of President of this General Assembly.  Out two  countries share important objectives in relation to Antarctica and  the liberalisation of trade in agricultural products. I also

acknowledge the courageous role you personally have played in the  consolidation of constitutional democracy lti Argentina. It is a  great pleasure therefore to see you presiding over our

deliberations at this particularly auspicious time for the United  Nations. .

This year of 1988 is not only a special one for Australia,  marking our Bicentenary, but also for the United Nations, marking  as it does the fortieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of  Human Rights, a landmark in the struggle of the international

community to guarantee individual rights for all people. Not  entirely coincidentally, it is also the fortieth anniversary of the  Presidency of this Assembly of one of the founding fathers of the  United Nations, and one of its strongest voices on behalf of the

small and middle powers - Dr Herbert Vere Evatt, then Foreign  Minister of Australia, who worked strenuously for, and who  announced during his presidency, the adoption by the General  Assembly of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

In preparing to address this Assembly for the first time, I  turned for a little encouragement to the wisdom and writing of my  distinguished Labor Government predecessor, and I was not  disappointed. A very great deal that Dr Evatt did, and thought,

and that was important to him, stands the test of those forty years.

Twice in his lifetime Evatt had seen the world tear itself  apart. In the First World War, both his brothers were killed. He  had seen the League of Nations collapse into impotence and  irrelevance. In the Second World War he had been Foreign Minister  when Australia was in grave peril.

To him, therefore, the introduction to the Charter - "We,  the people of the United Nations, determined to save succeeding  generations from the scourge of war" - was not just a resounding  piece of rhetoric, but a commitment born of despair and necessity.

Fortunately we have all been spared a third world war since then.  But this period has seen tragedy and suffering wrought on our  fellow human beings by a continuous epidemic of conflicts - both  regional and internal - which have blotted the world's

landscape. We have seen the return of chemical weapons. War has  filled the refugee camps of the world. Violence has been father to  suffering, poverty, homelessness, on a scale that indicts us all.

Peace-making and Peace-keeping

The United Nations has performed indispensable work in dealing  with the tragic consequences of these conflicts. But the sad  reality is tnat for most of the last four decades it has largely  been blocked from performing the task for which it was  pre-eminently created, the peaceful resolution of conflict itself.

So it is with a profound sense of hope for the future that we  look back over the last eighteen months. From Southern Africa to  the Western Sahara, through the Middle East, the Mediterranean,  across to Afghanistan and Cambodia, we see the United Nations, led  by its Secretary-General, at last bringing to bear the collective  will and commitment of the nations of the world.

The Secretary-General and the United Nations Peacekeeping  Forces thoroughly deserve their award of this year's Nobel Peace  Prize. The prize is a very timely recognition of the commitment  that this organisation must continue to assert:  that deep-seated  ,  and genuine differences must be resolved without blood and agony

for ordinary men and women caught up in conflicts not of their  making.

In Afghanistan, despite many problems,  the Geneva Accords are  holding. The Soviet Union has met the target for the withdrawal of  50 per cent of its forces and we urge that it maintain the.agreed  target for the complete withdrawal.  Withdrawal will provide the  conditions for the essential next step of allowing the people of  Afghanistan to decide for themselves their form of government.

The international community has a responsibility, through the  United Nations,  to assist in the reconstruction of this land  devastated by invasion and war,  and to help provide for the  millions of refugees it has created.

We have all greeted with immense relief the cease-fire between  Iran and Iraq, another extraordinary achievement of the United  Nations. But we are deeply concerned that although the fighting  has stopped, there has been little apparent progress in talks

between Iran and Iraq under the auspices of the Secretary-General.  Australia urges both Iraq and Iran to bring about an enduring  peace, in accordance with Security Council Resolution 598.

In Southern Africa there is a distinct prospect that .   independence for Namibia is at hand. But it is still only a  prospect. As a traditional supporter of the UN's peacekeeping  activities, Australia reconfirms its willingness to participate in

Che United Nations Transitional Arrangements Group for Namibia.

Australia also fully supports che efforts of the  Secretary-General towards resolving the conflict in the Western  Sahara.

3.

In recent weeks,  the most promising meetings in many years have  occurred between the President of Cyprus and the leader of the  Turkish Cypriot community, under the auspices of the  Secretary-General.

There have also been encouraging signs in our own region. My  visit to New Caledonia three weeks ago and my discussions there  with all major parties confirm that the process set in train by the  Matignon and Oudinot accords is not only workable but has generated

a whole new spirit of reconciliation and optimism. The process to  which .the Rocard Government and all the major groups in New  Caledonia have committed themselves has Australia's support and  that of the South Pacific Forum. We in the Sou.th Pacific share

with Prance a determination to assist the peaceful evolution of New  Caledonia to self-determination in a way which ensures that the  legitimate interests of all the people of New Caledonia, including  its indigenous Melanesian population, are fully protected, and  their aspirations are given a chance to be realized.

i  Once again, after many years, Korea is on the agenda of the  ‘General Assembly - but for the first time as a single item.  Australia heartily endorses the common goal of this new item;  peace, reconciliation and dialogue in the Korean peninsula.

Australia finds encouraging the recent willingness by both South  and North Korea to consider resuming dialogue. We believe there is  now a real opportunity to bring to an end 35 years of confrontation.

There have also been important recent developments relating to  the conflict in Cambodia. Talks are taking place among concerned  parties. The Jakarta Informal Meeting, ably presided over by  Indonesian Foreign Minister Alatas, realistically noted that a  solution will not only require the withdrawal of Vietnamese  Military Forces, but also the prevention of the return of the'

genocidal policies and practices of Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge. The draft ASEAN resolution this year makes that point, and we  welcome that statement.

There remain, regrettably, a number of regional conflicts and  tensions where there has been less progress.

Australia is especially concerned about the seemingly  intractable nature of the Arab/Israeli dispute. Australia's  commitment to the State of Israel is firm: it traces back to Dr Evatt's time and has not wavered since. The right of Israel to

exist within secure and recognised boundaries is and must remain an  indispensable condition of peace.

It is from this firm basis of commitment and friendship to  Israel Chat we say that peace and justice for Israel will only be  found when there is also peace and justice for the Palestinians.

4.

The right of self-determination for the Palestinian people  including, If they so choose, the possibility of an independent  Palestinian State, must be recognised. Israel's friends can only  view with concern the continued occupation of the West Bank and  Gaza. Recent events there put at stake its reputation and future  as a liberal democratic state, and risk increasing isolation from

traditional friends and supporters,  like ourselves, who place  priority on respect for democratic ideals and fundamental human  rights.

It. is also time for the Palestinians to take historic decisions  regarding their relations with Israel.  The PLO must reject,  unequivocally, the use of terror, accept the process of  negotiation, and be prepared, clearly and without equivocation, to

recognise Israel. To be durable, any negotiated settlement must  take account of the legitimate interests of Syria, Jordan, Lebanon  and other countries of the region.

In Burma we have witnessed tragic loss of life as the Burmese  ,  people have struggled for their political and economic rights. The  Burmese people have our deepest sympathy and I offer to them  Australia's support in the period of reconstruction and

reconciliation which must follow the resolution of the current  crisis.

Mr President, while there is much still to be done, recent  events do hold out prospects for peace that only a few years ago  would have been thought of as naive fantasy. Who among us two  years ago - even one year ago - would have envisaged, for example,

that President Reagan would be able to stand before us at this time  and say that in many regional conflicts the Soviet Union had shown  a "spirit of constructive realism"?

The U.N. itself has been a crucial contributor to the improved  East-West atmosphere. The United Nations needs the great powers,  but the great powers also need the United Nations. There is a wide  and growing agenda of issues that cannot be resolved by the great

powers acting unilaterally or bilaterally. The great powers, alone  or together, can hamstring the United Nations; but alone or  together, they cannot by themselves make it work. ,

An effective United Nations requires the collective will and  commitment of the whole international community. It is only when  this is fully accepted by everyone that the recovery of the United  Nations, with all its potential, will become permanent.

Disarmament and Arms Control

There can be few areas where this is better exemplified than  disarmament and arms control. The conclusion by the United States  and the Soviet Union of the INF agreement, the first arms control  agreement eliminating an entire class of nuclear weapons, is a

truly significant development,  as is the acceptance under that  agreement of highly intrusive provisions for verification, which in  turn make further agreements possible. Great progress has been  made towards concluding an agreement to cut by 50 per cent

strategic nuclear arsenals. For all these developments Presidents  Reagan and Gorbachev deserve the gratitude of us all.

But nuclear disarmament and arms control are not matters  exclusively for those great powers which currently possess nuclear  weapons. For if there is a nuclear conflict, it is not just the  peoples of the nuclear weapon states who will suffer. The peoples  of the world will be devastated. As the potential victims of  nuclear catastrophe, the peoples of all nations have the right to  ,  demand real progress and the eventual elimination of nuclear

weapons. They have the right to demand that the nuclear arms race  not take new forms, including its spread into outer space.

One of the few things that has given the people of the world  some confidence that nuclear catastrophe will not occur is that  almost all the nations of the world have undertaken not to acquire  nuclear weapons. Australia considers the Nuclear Non-Proliferation  Treaty, which embraces this commitment, to be perhaps the single  most important arms control agreement in existence. We consider

its preservation to be of paramount importance to peace and  security.

We understand and have shared the frustrations many countries  feel at the glacial pace of progress towards nuclear disarmament,  but we do not believe this frustration is well-served by bringing  into question the Non-Proliferation Treaty itself. Does any nation

really believe that its security, or the safety of the world, would  be served by a world where yet more states have nuclear weapons?  Further nuclear proliferation would bring about an even more  desperately dangerous world than the one we now inhabit.

So we appeal once more to those countries which have not yet  become parties to the Treaty to do so without delay.

And, remembering as we always must the terms of the compact  chat lies behind the Non-Proliferation Treaty, in which the nuclear  weapons states undertook to negotiate nuclear disarmament in good  faith and at an early date, we appeal once again to those existing  nuclear weapons states to accelerate the progress they have been  making towards the elimination of these weapons.

6.

The urgent conclusion of a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty - to  prohibit all nuclear tests by all states in all environments for  all time - would be a major barrier to the further refinement of  nuclear weapons and it would be an additional obstacle to  prospective proliferatocs.  I hope this Assembly will once more

resoundingly call on the Conference on Disarmament to resume work  on its nuclear testing item.

Chemical Weapons

The most immediate threat is posed by chemical weapons. The  Secretary-General, after careful investigation, has found repeated  use of chemical weapons in the Gulf region. We condemn such use,  without qualification or equivocation. '

We are convinced that the only solution to the increasing use  and spread of these abhorrent weapons lies in the early conclusion  by the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva of a comprehensive  Chemical Weapons Convention. Australia actively supports all  practical measures to advance the negotiations for a convention and

to prevent the further erosion of international norms against the  use of chemical weapons.

In this context the proposal for an International Conference on  Chemical Weapons use, made last week in this Assembly by President  Reagan, has the support of the Australian Government and, we hope,  of all member states of the United Nations. To give effect to that  proposal we must seek to ensure that the International Conference

is open to participation by all States, is convened as soon as  possible this year and is attended at a very high level.

The conference must have a clearly defined central purpose: a  declaration that chemical weapons must never be used and a  commitment to bring into existence a universal chemical weapons  convention, as currently being negotiated in Geneva, which would

rid the world of chemical weapons for all time.

One of the clear messages to come from the Third Special  Session on Disarmament in June was that we all have a  responsibility for disarmament. We cannot lay the blame for the  state of the world only at the door of those who possess nuclear  arsenals.

The quest for greater security through higher and higher levels  of conventional arms is only too well known to us all. The  International Conference on Disarmament and Development provided  ample evidence. It is a simple proposition that more arms do not  equal greater security. They feed the appetite of instability and

the coffers of those who choose to supply arms at levels that are  well beyond those needed for self-defence.

7.

The only way that peace and security will ultimately be  guaranteed is by universal acceptance of the principles of Common  Security so well articulated by the Palme Commission in 1982: the  thrust of which is that no country can guarantee its own security

by threatening others, and that real security is achieved not  against other countries but with them.

Human Rights

While the founders of this organization saw immediate issues of  peace and security as the pre-eminent role of the United Nations,  they also understood clearly that the root of many of the world's  conflicts lay in poverty, suffering, and abuses, of human rights.

Australia insists that human rights know no boundaries. Human  rights must always be high on this organisation's agenda.

The repulsive and contemptible system of apartheid in South  Africa is the most serious instance of institutionalised abuse of  .human rights facing us today, and we continue to urge the United  Nations Security Council to adopt comprehensive mandatory economic

sanctions as an effective means of bringing it to a peaceful end.

In the absence of such mandatory UN sanctions, we have worked  within Che Commonwealth to develop an effective pattern of economic  sanctions aiming particularly at the banking and finance system, as  well as strategies to meet South African propaganda and strengthen

the economic security of the front-line state in meeting  destabilisation by South Africa.

Australia also recognises that all countries must be answerable  to the nations of the world on these issues - and we are willing,  ourselves, to answer to the nations of the world for Australian  policies and actions.

Every year sees an anniversary of one kind or another, but 1988  is a very special one for my country. Two hundred years ago,  Europeans arrived to establish permanent settlement in Australia.  Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders of course were there

before us: they are celebrating at this time not their  Bicentenary, but their Bicentennial Bicentenary - some 40,000  years of habitation on Australian soil. All too many of the 200  years of European settlement have been, for our original  Australians, years of discrimination, cruelty, and oppression.  Australians today cannot reverse that history, but nor are today's

Australians responsible for it. Our duty today is to acknowledge  the truth of our history, and to redress it.

In the last twenty years, significant progress has been made.  Aboriginal and Islander Australians have the same legal and civil  rights as other Australians. We are taking special"measures to  accelerate access to services and to provide a basis for further  economic, social and legal advancement. We are seeking to complete

a compact or agreement with our Aboriginal people and Islanders  acknowledging their rightful place, not only in the past of our  ancient continent, but in its present and future.

8.

Although much has been done to improve the position of  Aboriginal Australians, much remains to be done. We have  undertaken to the descendants of our original inhabitants - and I  repeat that undertaking to the United Nations - that we will leave

undone nothing that can be done to right this great wrong of our  past.

Racial prejudice and discrimination have no place in any  contemporary society, and have none in my country today. Over  twenty years ago, bipartisan agreement was achieved within  Australia to bring to an end the abhorrent but long

officially-sanctioned racially restrictive immigration policy. I  bring here now on behalf of my Government the solemn undertaking,  recently confirmed by resolution of both Houses of our national  Parliament, that never again shall we allow race to be used as a  criterion in the exercise of our sovereign tight to decide who  shall enter our country. That undertaking is made not only as a

reflection of deeply held principle, but also because if Australia  were to do otherwise, we would deserve the censure of the world.

Trade and Development

Australia shares with developing countries the conviction that  Che UN has a major role to play in the areas of international trade  and development.  We have a commitment second to none in ensuring the success of  the Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations in the GATT.  The Round is an historic opportunity for the world to demonstrate

conclusively its commitment to the multilateral trading system and  to forestall the fragmentation into hostile trading blocs that  damaged us all in the 1930s. .

The potential benefits of liberalisation are great, and the  need is urgent. Results in key areas are very important at the  Mid-Term Review of the Uruguay Round to be held in Montreal in  December. Early results will enhance the confidence of the

participants in the Round and establish a solid base for its  ultimate success.

As efficient producers of agricultural commodities, Australia  and its fellow members of the Cairns Group of Fair Trading Nations  in Agriculture have a natural common interest in promoting a more  liberal trading system in agriculture. The benefits, however, can

be far more widely shared. Recent research indicates that food  importers would benefit from liberalisation and the removal of  distortions in international agricultural trade. The adoption of  market oriented agricultural policies in the industrialised

countries lies at the heart of the agricultural trade reform  issue.

9.

Nor are Australia's interests confined to agricultural trade  reform. Australia strongly supports efforts to strengthen the GATT  framework, secure a broaobased liberalisation of trade and extend  multilateral discipline into new areas such as services and

intellectual property rights. The Uruguay Round provides an  opportunity for us all to tackle these persistent and serious  problems: an opportunity that might not come again soon.

The Environment ~~ The value^ of the UN is demonstrated particularly when it helps  resqlv.e problems which respect no national boundaries. One such  problem is the environment, especially changes to the world's

climate. .

Australia and our island neighbours in the Pacific and Indian  Oceans have already pointed to the potentially serious consequences  of the warming of the earth's atmosphere. The very existence of a  number of our fellow countries in the world is at stake. It is  only by a total international commitment that we can protect  ourselves, and we look to this General Assembly to give a stronger  '  focus to international measures for dealing with this threat to our

environment.

The Antarctic Treaty is a good example of international  cooperation embracing environmental and disarmament concerns. It  has grown from the original twelve signatories in 1959 to .   thirty-eight with the accession in May of Canada. The disarmament

provisions of the Antarctic Treaty ensure that the territory is  used only for peaceful purposes. The Treaty has promoted  scientific research, environmental protection and conservation, has  kept the continent free from international tensions, and deserves

continuing support.

Administrative Reform

This General Assembly has commenced on a note of high optimism,  not least because of the commitment of the United States to meet  its financial obligations to the United Nations and to repay its  arrears.

Australia has always maintained that all member states must  abide by their obligations to the Charter of the United Nations.  All should pay their assessed contributions in full and on time,  and Australia has always done so.

The decison of the United States to meet its financial  obligations should not give rise to complacency about the need for  reform. Much has been done to make the United Nations more  efficient since the Group of 18 intergovernmental experts submitted

their report of reform in 1986, but there is still much to be done  - especially in implementing an improved budgetary" process,   ordering priorities and avoiding duplication.

10.

A strong, efficient United Nations is the best guarantee that  the organisation will be able to meet the new and different  challenges it confronts. And it is only if the UN is strong and  efficient that continued support can be guaranteed from the  parliaments and taxpayers of its member states. This is especially

the case at a time when new peacekeeping operations are likely to  place much greater burdens on all of us.

Australia will not shrink from its share of that burden, now  that /  the UN is succeeding in its pre-eminent role of peacemaker and  peacekeeper. We have contributed personnel and financial resources  to the peacekeeping force in the Gulf.  We have, committed funds for

the rehabilitation of Afghanistan. We have committed ourselves in  principle to providing 300 personnel to UN transitional  arrangements in Namibia. It is against that background and with  those credentials that we urge the Secretariat to ensure rigorous

economy in developing its peacekeeping plans.

,  The reform process should proceed at many levels. There is an  urgent need for rationalisation of the economic and social areas of  the United Nations. The Secretary-General must have greater  flexibility to adjust the human resources of the organisation to  meet emerging priorities such as peacekeeping,  human rights,  drug  control programs and the status of women.

I began my remarks today by referring to Dr Evatt, and.let me  conclude the same way.

Evatt was a towering figure in Australian life. He was one of  our greatest lawyers, a Judge of our High Court,  and Chief Justice  of a State Supreme Court.  He was Attorney-General, Foreign'  Minister, and Leader of the Opposition. He was a journalist and a

writer - not always the same thing' .  For decades he was at the  centre of political, social and economic change in our nation,  often its most controversial figure. He was an ardent nationalist.

But to this ardent nationalist, nothing in his life's work was  more important than this international organisation, here in New  York. For all his many achievements, titles and honours,  his  modest grave in our national capital has inscribed on it only his

name and the words "President of the United Nations Assembly".

He once described in his characteristically straightforward way  what he saw as the objective of the United Nations.  In 1948 he  pleaded for governments to keep faith with their peoples. They  wanted, he said,  "not very much;  just peace and justice and decent

standards of living for themselves perhaps,  but mainly for their  children".

Those words are simple and modest.  They remind us that this  place does not belong to the powerful or the wealthy; that it does  not exist for diplomats or officials or statesmen. This  organisation belongs to the ordinary men and women of our world.

It was founded on a promise to those men and women that never again  would their leaders Bring upon them war, injustice and poverty. That promise has not to date been honoured.

We have today a second chance - a chance to fulfil that  40-year-old promise to our peoples, to bring them "peace, justice,  and a decent standard of living".

Let’s get it tight this time. .
