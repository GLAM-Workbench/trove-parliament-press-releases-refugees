Ã¢Â‘ Ã¢Â‘ BOAT PEOPLE

Since November 1989, 6~ people have afrlved ln  Au.srralia by small boat. This Fad Sheet canvasses some  of the issues associated 'Nith t.helr arrival.

How did they travel to Australia?

- Early arrivals ~cd a'bÂ¢ut 1,000lan from the;Kompoog Som re~ou ot CAmbodia to Singapore and then to Io "dolle~ia and Australia, w.:lng between 20 - 30 days aboard boats about 20 metresÃ¢Â‘ in length. Later aniva4 came !rom locations in the southern provinces of China, such as Behai,Nanning and Ol..nzh()u in Guan~ Province, taki.n~ around 30 days to sail via Indonesia . \Vho are the boat people? The people have come from i variety of backgrounds including clerical worker' a..od mechanics. In addition.., some were self employed while others were under "employed. Mo~t ~id they paid money for the right to m.U:e the boat trip. Ã¢Â‘ Why have they been detained? None o( the boat people had authority to enter Australia. In most cases, they carried no formal identification documc;nt.s. Under the Migration Ac.t, people detected enterini Australia without authority are rcquirc:d to be detained while any claim to stay is W~$$ed. The legality of detention A Hi!i:h Co!lrt jud~~m~nt i.n December 1992 upheld rhe validity of boldini boat peopl~ i.o. ClJstody u.o.til their status bas been deterrnin~d. There is a question that people beld before speciflc.legislation was passed mAY h:we be.e.n held illegally; some boat people are c\ltl'tntly setli.ng damages based on this claim. 'Vhere are they housed? Temporary accommodation was provided to bouse boat people until the Port Hedl~d Rue!'ltlM 8..!1d :Process "ing Centre was cotM1l.ssloned 1n October 1991. Tbe Port Hedland facility, formerly a min.ing company's sin~le persoc.s quarters, w~ .selected bocause o! its proximity to boat arrival points, the quality of its accommodation, and because its location allowed a low security environ "ment to be established without compromlsift~ custody  ~ues. As a temporary measure, one group bu ~o.

housed at the Westbridie mi~&Dt centre in Sydney  pending the .fin.al.isatlon of their refugee c.Wms. Part of  this centre was commissioned i.e. Augu.U 1991.

What are the conditions for boat people?

At each of the centres., families are grouped together,  ~ually i.o one-bed or two-bed rooms. Food is provided

~d boat people usht in its preparation and servini- to

encourage food preparation and presentation that is  cY-ltw~y appropriate to the particular group.

MediOll facilities include an on-site nuno !or immedlate  medical c.are, wilh norrual medical, dental and phar " maceutical sen-ices provided by professionals at no cost  to the residents. Where a medlw practitioner recom "

mends. counsellin~ or trtatment not readily available  locally, the servite is arr~d usually by tr~ferrin~ the  person co a clcy where it is available.

Edu01tion facilities include pre-primary, primary and  secondary classes provided under contract at both  facilities at no cost to the residents; English classes for  adults are provided by voluntary groups. Some vocation " al ciasaeA have been offered.

Counsellors are made available on an Ad hoc bi!.$i$. A  welfare officer is also provided most of the tl.tne.

Re~Uon facilities at Port Hedla.od include gudcniog.  ball sports, pool facilities (snook~r), &ome gymnasium  equipment and $CwUl~

~1 QS!il~tance is Government-funded and is available  to all boat people to help them with their claims for.  rdu~cc status . This ~ista~ce incl'.locs preparation oÂ£

initial claims a.nd applieatiOD.$ for review under the two " stage re~gee det~rml.n.a.don process. Applicants are, of  cours~, free to obtain assistance from other sources such

a.S private $Â¢licit Or$ or community groups.

land a.nd Westbridge.

\Vhat is th~ nf.\lgt " ptocess?

Australia is a party to the 1951 U~ed Natior:l.S Conven " tion and the 1967 Protocoll~l~tWi to refugees. Under  the Convention, Australia has an obligation not to return  someone to a country where they have a well "founded  fear of persecutio11.

is the only standard for assessing clai.m.s . The ass.ess " mect.! arc biLScd On ~ person's present circumstances.  Past events, eve11 though they may have been 'traUID>ltk,  may or may not be relevant; what ~ being assessed iJ  whether the person would face persecution if they

r~lurned to cheit homeland.

Giving refugee status is desi~ed to give protection Â£o  those wbo o.etd it rather than be an alternate way of  m.ign.ti.oi to Australi~ .

The refugee Qetcrroioation process and tht criteria used  by AU$tralian decision makers is based on United Na " lion..s guidelines and has been developed iu close consult " ation with Austr;illa.a rcpn~stntatives of the UN High

Comm~.sioner for Refugees (UNHCR).

Initially, a boat person w:ill be interViewed by a refugee  officer or chc Dc~artment oC lmw.igraclon, Local  Government and Ethnic Affairs, whQ \\ill either rec~;~ta "  mend acceptance or rejection of 1\ refugee claim. If a

person's claim is not accepted, they can appeal the  decision to the Refugee Statl)..$ Re\iew CotWl11ttee. The  Committee has representatives Cro.m DILGEA, Foreign  Affairs 3..nd Trade and the Attorney-General's Depart " men~ a community representativ~; n_omln;~~cd by the

Refugee Council of Australia, and a l,JNHCR observer.  Tbe Committtcc rc,~ews an applicant's case and makes  recommendations to a final decision maker. This  decision-maker is a DILGEA officer. (This appeal

process will be replaced on lJuly 1993 by a statutory  body, l.hc Refug~e Review Tribunal).

\Yhat does gettln~ refuiee status mean?

Boat people getting refugee status are ~ven authority to  live in Australia for four y~ar~. and Utually tnove from  the processing centre into the co=uruty withill about  24 hours.

In.itially they may get accommodation in self-contained  DILGEA flats., or they may establish themselves in the  co=unit:y with the help of support ~oups. The Depart " Qlent nf Social Security treats refugees the same as other  Australian residents when dedding their eUgibility for

benefits. As temporary residents, they can sponsor im " mediate family men:abers to Australia. At the end of four  years. they may be given permanent rÂ¢$ideacy.
