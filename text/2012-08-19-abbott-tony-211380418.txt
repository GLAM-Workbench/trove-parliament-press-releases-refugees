TONY ABBOTT:

It’s terrific to be here at Sydney Olympic Park to help celebrate the friendship between Australia and India.  It’s great that we’ve got almost a half a million Indian born people living and working in Australia today.  They’re making a terrific contribution. They’re model Australians. It’s great that India is the emerging  democratic superpower of the 21st Century and I’m very determined on behalf of the Coalition to do  everything I can to make Indian people feel welcome in our country and also to strengthen the relationship  between India and Australia.

Of course, there are some other issues around today and in particular what we see today is a Prime Minister  in full damage control mode after the latest revelations on Labor’s new independent school hit list.  Modelling of the Gonski review, even a fully funded Gonski review, shows that fully one-third of  Australia’s 9,500 schools will be worse off. That’s what the modelling shows. There is a new hit list and  one-third of Australia’s schools are on this hit list. Now, it’s absolutely imperative that the Prime Minister  immediately release the Government’s official modelling and until such time as she releases the  Government’s official modelling, parents can have no certainty that their school's funding is safe. So on  behalf of the parents and pupils of Australia, I say to the Prime Minister: you’ve got to release the official  modelling because as things stand, fully one-third of the schools of Australia are on Labor’s new hit list.

QUESTION:

Apparently that response won’t be for another few weeks at least. Do you think the Government has left its  run too late with that response?

TONY ABBOTT:

Yet again, this is a chaotic government that has the Midas touch in reverse. They’ve had the Gonski report  for months now. They were obviously going to release the Government’s response today. They’ve had to  withdraw the Government’s response at the last minute because of the revelation in today’s papers, based on  modelling done by the schools and by the states, that fully one-third of Australia’s schools will be worse off  even if Gonski is fully funded. Even if the Government can find an extra $5 billion a year, still, one third of

Australia’s schools will be worse off. This is a real disaster for the Government. It’s another sign that this  Government is both untrustworthy and incompetent.

QUESTION:

There have been some other revelations. The Prime Minister has refused to discuss accusations regarding  her resignation at Slater & Gordon. What are your thoughts on that?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think there are real issues the Prime Minister needs to address and if she would like to make a statement to  the Parliament this week, the Coalition will gladly facilitate it.

QUESTION:

Do you think she has done anything wrong?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think there are questions that she does need to address. Let’s not forget that these issu es were most recently  raised in the Parliament not by the Coalition but by a member of her own Cabinet, Robert McClelland. I  think there are questions that the Prime Minister does need to answer.

QUESTION:

And what are those questions?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, as I said, this issue was most recently raised not by the Coalition but by a member of the Prime  Minister’s own Cabinet, Robert McClelland, and I think the Prime Minister does need to answer those  questions.

QUESTION:

But you’re saying she should make a statement to the Parliament. What questions do you think she needs to  answer?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think she does need to make a full statement about the circumstances under which she left the law firm.

QUESTION:

Does it look like she’s done something untoward to you?

TONY ABBOTT:

As I said, this issue was raised not by the Coalition, not by the Coalition, but by a member of her own  Cabinet, Robert McClelland. That’s why it’s a perfectly legitimate issue for the media to pursue.

QUESTION:

The Coalition had said that Nauru and Manus Island were ready to go. It appears that’s not the case. Does  this proposal still have the Coalition’s support?

TONY ABBOTT:

I have given the Government credit this week for finally adopting just one of the three important policies  that are necessary to stop the boats. Having belatedly come to the acceptance that Nauru and Manus Island  are an important element in the comprehensive policy to stop the boats, the Prime Minister should just get  on with it. She should stop complaining. She should just get on with it.

QUESTION:

So it still has your full support?

TONY ABBOTT:

Oh, yes. If we want to stop the boats. We need three things. We need vigorous offshore processing at Nauru,  we need temporary protection visas to deny the people smugglers a product to sell and we need the option of  turning boat around where it’s safe to do so.

QUESTION:

Are asylum seeker boats going to slow in the coming weeks with this new offshore processing regime?

TONY ABBOTT:

If the Government vigorously pursues offshore processing at Nauru and Manus, certainly that will send a  very strong signal to people smugglers. It would send an even stronger signal to the people smugglers and  their customers if the Government was also to adopt temporary protection visas and show a willingness to  turn boats around where it’s safe to do so.

QUESTION:

Do you think the US has been open about any plans it has to extradite Julian Assange?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think that it’s very important that Julian Assange should be given the ordinary assistance that’s given to  Australians in trouble abroad. No more, no less.

QUESTION:

Ok, but do you think the US is being open about any plans it has to extradite him?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I think the issue for Australia is what assistance are we giving Julian Assange and we should be giving  him the ordinary assistance which is provided to Australians in trouble abroad. No more and no less.
