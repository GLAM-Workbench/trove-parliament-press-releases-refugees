E&OE TRANSCRIPT  TELEVISION INTERVIEW  SKY NEWS AM AGENDA INTERVIEW WITH KIERAN GILBERT   WEDNESDAY, 7 MAY 2014

SUBJECT/S:  Budget; Tony Abbott’s new tax; asylum seekers; Australia’s  relationship with Indonesia

KIERAN GILBERT: With me on the program this morning the Shadow Immigration  Minister Richard Marles and also the Parliamentary Secretary for the Environment  Simon Birmingham, Senator Birmingham first to you on this issue of a debt levy  apparently there is division within the cabinet but also pretty public within the party  as well as you’ve seen this morning from your LNP counterpart Teresa Gambaro.

SENATOR SIMON BIRMINGHAM, PARLIAMENTARY SECRETARY FOR THE  ENVIRONMENT: Kieran, in this Budget we’ll be taking difficult decisions and  they’re difficult decisions that we don’t take lightly, but we take out of regard for the  future of Australia and how we address our priorities such as getting the Budget  back under control.  Now it was always to be expected that there would be a level of  debate about a number of the measures that might ultimately end up in the Budget,  everybody as Jamie (Briggs) rightly said, everybody would be wise to wait until  Tuesday and see the final shape of the Budget, but what they can have confidence  what it will do is firstly is it will seek to bring under control the future projections of  Government debt, which without change, without change are scheduled to run to a  gross debt in excess of $600 billion dollars for Australia, something quite  unsustainable, we will bring that under control by getting spending under control, by  making long term structural adjustments to programs to make sure that we don’t  see continued ballooning of expenditure growth, and of course by having a look at  anything else we can sensibly do to ensure the Budget not only drives us towards  balance as fast as possible but is as fair as possible as well.

GILBERT:  Richard Marles do you concede that that was their overriding, the  Coalition’s overriding commitment to get the Budget back on track?

RICHARD MARLES, SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND BORDER  PROTECTION: In terms of the deficit levy, the proposed deficit levy, Teresa  Gambaro has made the very obvious point, she has hit the nail on the head, and  she’s a very honourable MP, in making it clear that if that is put in place it is a clear  broken promise, it is in effect an increase in income tax.

Now this is a Government, a party which went to the last election saying they were  about reducing taxes rather than increasing them, they were about getting rid of  taxes rather than introducing new ones, and in their very first budget they are in  effect increasing income tax.  And it’s not surprising that you’re seeing Coalition MPs  horrified of what that represents at so many levels, but principally, what it  represents in terms of the dishonesty with the Australian people, saying one thing  before an election and doing another thing after.

But can I just say Kieran, on the question you ask, if there is a budget emergency  and if it’s about getting the books back in shape, well you can judge that budget  emergency by the paid parental leave scheme which seeks to put in place out of the  public purse a measure which will give more to the people that earn more, which  goes completely contrary to all we understand about how social safety nets should  be put in place.

So this is a Budget which has been messed up in terms of the public expectation and  the preparation for it and the lead up to it, it is a budget which is purely going to  have twisted priorities right through it, and I think it’s not surprising that Australians  are looking with a great deal of scepticism towards next Tuesday night.

GILBERT:  It’s not just backbenchers Senator Birmingham who are raising  concerns, as I mentioned earlier, it is understood that there are significant  differences of opinion within the Cabinet, but we don’t need to speculate on that, we  saw very publicly one of the Liberal party heroes, we discussed this yesterday, Peter  Costello saying it would have no economic impact in fact would hurt growth, Teresa  Gambaro today has basically used very similar words, she said it would have a  devastating impact on the economy, that is the debt tax idea, and peoples’  confidence.  What do you say to that critique, that argument, that a debt tax not  only goes against promises, but that it would actually be counter-productive?

BIRMINGHAM:  Kieran one of the reasons why it’s so important to wait until the  Budget on Tuesday, is because what people should be looking at is the totality of  the Government’s policy agenda, and what we have of course is a range of policies  like getting rid of the carbon tax and the mining tax, like reducing red tape and  green tape, and stripping some one billion dollars of regulatory burden for business  out of the Australian economy, that are all about driving a growth agenda, that are  all about making it more competitive for Australian businesses, that will make in  axing the carbon tax Australian households around $550 dollars per annum better  off on average -



GILBERT:  But the problem is you’ve got convincing to do, it’s not about convincing  myself or even our viewers, you’ve got your own colleagues to convince, that’s the  issue here with a number speaking privately and even some as we’ve seen this  morning speaking publicly.

BIRMINGHAM:  Well that’s the beauty of the Liberal family Kieran, we have robust  debates, but I’m convinced that they will be convinced, I believe that when people  do see the type of measures that are being framed in this budget they’ll understand  that overall our Government policy to absolutely bring down taxes overall, and make  sure that Australia is more competitive, but also to bring the Budget back under  control, while building the roads of the 21st Century, all of these things will be being  addressed in this Budget.  Now it’s complicated, it’s complicated framing of course a  multi-billion dollar budget of the size and scale as it is, it’s made all that much harder  by the fact that we had five record deficits under Labor, that we have an enormous  trajectory of growth in Government spending as demonstrated by the Commission of  Audit, all of these things necessitate what are very difficult decisions, but we won’t  squib the difficult decisions, we’ll take decisions in the long term nationally.

GILBERT:  Senator Birmingham uses the word squib, and I think it’s a fair way to  describe what’s happened from Labor. In 2008 Richard Marles, Labor had talked up  a tough budget, didn’t deliver it, and the rest is history.  This Government says  they’ve got to get the books in order, if they’re going to deliver a tough budget,  you’re going to anger some people that’s the bottom line isn’t it?

MARLES:  In terms of history, what history will record is that Labor gave to this  Government an economy with a AAA credit rating which wasn’t delivered to us by  John Howard, AAA credit rating by all the international credit rating agencies -

BIRMINGHAM:  You had money in the bank Richard - 2007, you had a clean set  of books why don’t you admit that?

MARLES:  Well that is what we bequeathed to the Abbott Government and what we  have is one of the lowest public debt rates in the developed world, but can I just  make the, take time up on the question of robust debate within the Liberal party. I  don’t think it’s that robust, we’ve just heard the Member for Brisbane, a Member of  Parliament make some comments and be very publicly told by her party colleagues  to shut up until next week.  There’s nothing robust about that debate, but she’s  making the very important point that if you put in place an effective increase in  income tax that will have a deleterious effect on economic growth.

And we’ve already seen the OECD come out and say that the kind of cuts that are  being talked about by the Government’s Commission of Audit, will represent a  pressure downwards on economic growth within Australia, all of that is of enormous  concern, and this is in the context of this budget emergency which the Government  talks about, so much of an emergency that they are putting in place a measure, the  paid parental leave scheme which will pay more money to people the more you

earn.  That’s the extent of the emergency that ought to be judged by the  Government’s actions.

BIRMINGHAM:  Which is funded -

MARLES:  Funded out of the Budget -

GILBERT:  Now I spoke to Jamie Briggs as well this morning about the Costello  critique, I want to play what he had to say about Peter Costello let’s have a listen:

“Former footballers always claim that football is a better standard when they played  and thus their comparative performance was always better, you know, it’s not  surprising that you know, people are entitled to their view but at the end of the day,  we are dealing with the contemporary situation, we are dealing with the situation  that we were left “

GILBERT:  Senator Birmingham a bit of a whack there as well for the former, well  the longest serving Treasurer in the nation’s history, what do you say to that?

BIRMINGHAM:  Peter is a very experienced Treasurer, a very experienced  commentator, which he is nowadays, and he’s welcome as a commentator to of  course say what he wants to say. We are framing a budget though in very difficult  circumstances, we’re framing a budget though and it shouldn’t be forgotten that it  sits in the context of all of our other of our policy priorities as well which I spoke of  before, and this is a Government that is going to go very hard for economic growth,  and in all of the speculation that I’ve seen and it does all remain speculation, about  different types of tax levies, it should not be forgotten that in getting rid of the  carbon tax - that is of a far greater impact across the Australian economy and that  will of course reduce costs for so many households and provide a real stimulus to  the Australian economy and to the competitiveness of Australian businesses.

GILBERT:  Well that’s going to be the debate over coming months until we see the  new Senate, Richard Marles on the issue of tax cuts generally, the Abbott  Government according to The Australian today is going to firewall the commitment  to reduce company tax by 1.5 per cent, as part of its growth agenda, as described  by Senator Birmingham this morning.

MARLES: And doing that, in the context of putting in place a levy to fund the Paid  Parental Leave scheme and increasing income tax, I mean that’s the extent to which  that’s being firewalled, this is not a Government which is reducing taxation, this is  not a Government that is living up to the commitment that it made before the  election that it was going to reduce taxes rather than increase them, in its very first  budget it is doing exactly the opposite.

But can I say this Kieran, I mean you’ve got to love Jamie Briggs and you know that  as a partner on this show with you I actually do, but the thing about Jamie is for the  last few years in Opposition we have heard him laud Peter Costello as the greatest  Treasurer ever, get into Government and within six months he’s giving him a

massive whack and telling him to shut up as well.  It says everything about the fact  that this is a Government which was doing one thing before the election, finding it  much harder to govern the country after, and is doing a hash of a job in terms of  managing its first budget.

GILBERT:  Ok let’s take a break and we’ll talk about foreign policy and immigration  policy.

-  BREAK  --



GILBERT:  Richard Marles to you on the issue of Indonesia, clearly a discussion was  had on the phone the by Prime Minister and the Indonesian President. SBY issued a  statement subsequent to that saying he is keen to get this code of conduct new  protocol in place by August, so while there are some difficulties as there always are  in this relationship, it seems from the very top it remains the focus of President  Yudhoyono to smooth things over, you’d welcome that.

MARLES:  Well this Indonesian President has been a great friend of Australia  throughout his presidency, and it’s a wonderful thing for both countries and for the  relationship that he’s been able to perform his functions in the way he has and of  course that is good news.  Kieran it comes on the back of what we’ve seen over the  weekend of our Prime Minister turning back a visit to Indonesia, that’s not a small  thing to do in fact it’s a very large thing to do, we’re still not completely clear about  why the Prime Minister cancelled his visit to Indonesia, but it would appear that the  major reason is because of the on water operations that occurred over the course of  the weekend, we’ve heard -

GILBERT:  What’s wrong with that though? Because clearly Mr Abbott doesn’t want  to embarrass the Indonesian leadership, this is a policy that’s working, can you pin  point what’s wrong with that?

MARLES:  Well very clearly, if what we’ve got is a situation where on water  operations are resulting in the Australian Prime Minister having to cancel a visit to  Indonesia, there is no bigger indication than that about the negative impact that this  policy is having on our relationship with Indonesia, and any suggestion that it is not  a big deal in the relationship with Indonesia has now been clearly scotched by our  own Prime Minister’s actions over the weekend, and we see the Indonesia Foreign  Minister making this point even more clearly in the last 24 hours , that he has come  out and made the criticism that he has about Australia’s policy here is of deep  concern.

GILBERT:  But the Prime Minister’s already agreed to talks next month so it’s been  pushed back a few weeks, so it’s hardly a massive development is it, given they’ve  already locked in for a visit in June?

MARLES:  Well I don’t think we can use the phrase locked in, they are talking about  the possibility of a visit in June, but to cancel a Prime Ministerial visit to a country on  such short notice, I can assure you, is a massive step for a country to take, in terms

of our diplomatic relationship with Indonesia it’s deeply significant, everything about  the impact that this policy is having on our relationship with Indonesia, you describe  that it as a success - I make this point, it’s not just about seeing an end to the flow  of boats last month and this, it’s about having a sustainable policy in place this year  and next year.

BIRMINGHAM:  You couldn’t keep a policy in place for a year -

MARLES:  Well we’re not going to have a sustainable policy in place which sees a  long term reduction in the flow of asylum seeker vessels, a long term reduction in  the loss of life at sea unless we have a cooperative, productive relationship with  Indonesia, and the events over the last few days make it clear that this policy is not  generating that.

GILBERT:  I want to play a little of the Indonesian Foreign Minister, this was  responding to suggestions by the crew of an asylum seeker boat that Australian  personnel had put on three additional people onto an asylum seeker boat before  they turned the boat back and that was a concern to Marty Natalegawa, the  Indonesian Foreign Minister let’s have a listen:

“Any detail, explanation, apparently some additional three individuals were added to  the boat which was forced back to Indonesia, obviously this is a very serious  development. “

BIRMINGHAM:  Well Kieran I think we just heard a lot of hysterical innuendo and  from Richard before, really take a look at what President Yudhoyono has said in his  media statement which is a demonstration to his commitment alongside our  commitment to make sure we have the strongest possible relationship with  Indonesia going forward.  It was a very cordial telephone conversation between  Prime Minister Abbott and President Yudhoyono yesterday, they restated a mutual  commitment to resolve outstanding matters between our two countries, Prime  Minister Abbott will continue those discussions with President Yudhoyono, what we  are seeing is a strengthening of the relationship with Indonesia at present that’s  exactly of course what President Yudhoyono wants to see, what we want to see, and  that will continue to be strengthened and underpinned in part, by the success of our  border protection policies.

GILBERT:  What about the allegations made -

BIRMINGHAM:  It is of mutual benefit to both countries.

GILBERT:  What about the specific allegation made about Australian personnel  putting on three additional individuals onto an asylum seeker boat, how does that fit  with our international commitments?

BIRMINGHAM:  Kieran I don’t know anything about that specific allegation, what I  do know is that our policies are working and they are working because they have a  long term resolve to them.  I couldn’t believe that Richard could be talking about

whether you could keep policies in place for more than a year or two from a  Government that flip flopped continuously when it came to border protection  policies.

GILBERT:  Ok I want to ask -

BIRMINGHAM:  The reason our policies are working so well is our deep resolve to  make sure to make sure they work, and that is why we have effectively stopped  unauthorised arrivals to Australia.

GILBERT:  I want to ask Richard Marles about this allegation that has been made  that Australian personnel placed three additional people onto an asylum seeker boat  what implications does it have for Australian commitments internationally?   If it is  true because we don’t know if it is true.

MARLES:  See this is an untested allegation we don’t know that it is true, but if the  substance of the allegation was right, this would throw into serious question whether  Australia was abiding by its international obligations and particularly the protocol  against the smuggling of migrants by land, sea and air.  And we need to hear an  assurance from the Government today that the way in which it’s conducting its  operations on the high seas is consistent with that protocol and is consistent with  our international obligations.

But what we’ve heard from the Government and what we’ve just heard from Simon  as a Member of the Government is a deafening silence on this issue. There’s no  denial of these allegations that have been made, this would represent a really  significant and worrying development in the tactics of the Government if in fact  you’re seeing people, additional people, put onto an asylum seeker vessel and then  pushed in the direction of Indonesia.

But the silence from Scott Morrison has been utterly deafening and its entirely  consistent in the way in which this Government has gone about its approach from  day one, they’ve been treating the Australian people with contempt in not letting us  know what’s going on, and can I just say Kieran, having a strategy of chest beating  on good days but silence on bad is hardly a strategy which is going to see  responsible Government.

GILBERT:  I want to get your response just quickly Senator Birmingham to  conclude.

BIRMINGHAM:  Kieran, Richard is right, we are consistent, we are consistent in  not talking about operational matters and that consistency along with our  consistency in regards to the policies we’re implementing on border protection is  working, that’s why we have effectively stopped unauthorised arrivals. It is a long,  long time now since we’ve seen a boat successfully make its way to Australia.  It’s  that level of consistency in implementing policy that is making a difference which  stands in stark contrast to the record number of arrivals that occurred under the

previous Government, under Richard’s Government, because of their policy  inconsistencies and their constant flip-flopping.

GILBERT:  Gentleman we’ve got to go, Richard Marles and Simon Birmingham,  appreciate it.
