Â

Â

Customs Coastwatch today detected a vessel carrying 117 suspected 
illegal immigrants  at Ashmore Islands off north-west Australia, 
the Minister for Justice arid Customs, Senator Amanda Vanstone, announced 
today.

Â

The vessel, a motorised Indonesian boat, arrived this 
morning at Ashmore, 600km north of Broome and 800km west of Darwin, 
with a crew of six. The boat people consist of 97 men, nine women and 
11 children.

Â

The Navy patrol boat, HMAS Wollongong, has formally 
detained the vessel and its occupants. The Customs vessel, Botany Bay, 
will arrive tomorrow to provide support.

Â

It is expected that officials from the Department 
of immigration and Multicultural Affairs will process the people once 
they arrive on the mainland. Arrangements for the people’s removal 
from Ashmore have yet to be finalised.

Â

The vessel is the first Australian arrival of boat 
people in 2000.
