AUSTRALIA ACCEPTS POLITICAL PRISONERS FROM EL SALVADOR

The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs,  Mr Stewart  West, announced today that a number of El Salvadoreans had  been accepted for settlement in Australia under the  Government's Refugee and Special Humanitarian Program. They

should arrive within a few days.

The Minister announced the diversification of the Program on  16 May 1983 to include those people suffering human rights  problems in their home countries, with some emphasis on  Central and South America, and the Middle East.

The group of 77 El Salvadoreans, selected from 500 political  prisoners, were recently released under an Amnesty granted  by the El Salvadorean authorities.

The selection process was carefully undertaken by officers  of the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, in  conjunction with the Department of Foreign Affairs and  Canadian "officials.

The group selected include tradesmen, students, trade unionists  and administrative workers,  together with their families.

They had been detained for disseminating anti-Government  information, or engaging in anti-Government political or  trade union activity. They were released under the Amnesty  because investigations confirmed no terrorist or political

extremist links.

"These people feared for their lives if they remained in El  Salvador. It has been alleged that already some political  prisoners released have been shot by extremist groups.

"Our acceptance of these people under our Special Humanitarian  Program is in answer to a real humanitarian emergency in El  Salvador. This is precisely the situation our Program is  designed to address" Mr West said.
