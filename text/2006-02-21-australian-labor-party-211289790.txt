Our generation’s challenge



Speech to launch Labor’s policy discussion paper on  Australia’s development assistance



Our generation has a unique opportunity.

We can be the generation that ended extreme global poverty.

Unfortunately, Australia has been on the sidelines in the fight against poverty.

In  recent  years  the  global  community  has  committed  to  eliminating  absolute,  extreme   poverty by 2025.

Today, Labor’s team for international development is announcing: Labor is joining the  fight, to help make extreme poverty history.

The extremely poor are defined as those who have to live on less than one US dollar a  day.  This  is  the  poverty  that  kills  30,000  people  every  single  day,  because  they  cannot   eat,  because  they  lack  access  to  safe  drinking  water,  because  they  cannot  afford   medication for even basic afflictions like diarrhoea.

We  can  accept  this  challenge,  and  be  the  generation  that  helped  to  secure  a  peaceful,   prosperous world for future generations. Or we can be the generation that failed to make  a difference, through lack of imagination and lack of commitment.

Labor knows what the Australian people would choose.

The Australian people are committed, to help make extreme poverty history.

The Australian people demonstrated their generosity following the tsunami.

The Australian people want us to lend a helping hand.

800,000 Make Poverty History wristbands have been sold. Donations to NGOs involved  in overseas work continue to grow.

We need the imagination and the passion to make Australia a leader in the global effort to  stamp out extreme poverty.



Unfortunately, the Howard Government has treated the aid program like a slush fund.

AusAID is now tied up in the wheat for weapons scandal.

AusAID  spent  almost  $700,000  sending  Trevor  Flugge  off  to  Iraq  to  take  photos  of   himself with guns.

Every  dollar  spent  on  Trevor  Flugge  is  one  less  dollar  for  spending  on  children  in   developing countries.

For  helping  these  children  to  avoid  the  diseases  and  living  conditions  that  children  in   Australia, for the most part, never have to worry about.

It is an absolute disgrace that AusAID money was spent sending Trevor Flugge to Iraq.

But it just gets worse.

AusAID  also  paid  AWB  over  $400,000  to  provide  advice  to  the  Iraqis  on  agricultural   issues.

Giving $440,000 to AWB for advice on agricultural issues is like paying Dick Cheney for  advice on safe hunting practices.

There have been many failures in the Howard Government’s aid effort.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The  collapse  of  the  initial  billion-dollar  Enhanced  Cooperation  Program  with   Papua New Guinea.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The  failure  to  lend  a  helping  hand  in  the  Solomon  Islands  when  first  asked  in   2000, leading to the billion-dollar RAMSI intervention in 2003.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Using the aid budget to pay for asylum seekers on Nauru.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Shutting down funding for NGOs in East Timor.

The Howard Government’s performance on aid is a disgrace.

The smoke and mirrors in the aid program must end.

It’s time to clean out the closet.

We  need  a  government  that  will  commit  to  working  in  partnership  with  developing   countries to substantially reduce poverty.

We  need  a  government  that  will  commit  to  the  Millennium  Development  Goals  as  the   framework for Australia’s development assistance.

We  need  a  government  that  will  commit  to  the  right  institutional  framework  for  our   development  effort,  so  that  development  policy  is  at  the  centre  of  government,  not   relegated to the sidelines.



This is why Labor has a team for international development.

I of course am focused on our overseas aid.

Kevin is focused on trade and development issues, and of course all the other foreign  affairs issues that impact on development, from conflict to arms control.

Peter is focused on getting young people involved in our development effort. This helps  to build the constituency for development issues in Australia, which is the first step for  ensuring greater accountability.



Our team represents a coordinated, cohesive approach to development issues.

Labor has a number of innovative new proposals that we will be discussing with  stakeholders in the lead-up to the next election.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Labor believes the aid program must be guided by a single, clear objective -  helping developing countries to reduce poverty. An independent, transparent  OECD Review of AusAID in 2005 stated, ‘poverty reduction receives lower  prominence in Australian programming than AusAID’s policy statements would  suggest. This concern was raised by a number of Australian observers, and is  shared by the review team.’ The days of using AusAID as a slush fund must end.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Labor also believes we need a Legislative Charter to avoid situations like our aid  money being paid to AWB

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Labor  also  believes  that  we  need  a  ‘whole  of  community’  effort  if  Australia’s   development assistance is to be successful

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ To  this  end,  Labor  is  proposing  an  Australia-Pacific  Foundation,  to  facilitate   twinning  arrangements  between  local  communities  in  the  eastern  states  of   Australia and our Pacific neighbours

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ We are also proposing an Australia-Peace and Community Team

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ We believe the Government also needs to establish Civil Society Partnership  Agreements to ensure NGOs are at the heart of our efforts

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ We want to see more support for Africa, and we have proposed the establishment  of sister country programs where Australia will provide more substantial funding,  and in-depth support, for one or two African countries

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ In  terms  of  institutional  arrangements,  we  will  consider  whether  Australia’s   development assistance would be made more effective and efficient by separating

AusAID from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and establishing it as  a  separate  Department  for  International  Development,  with  responsibility  for   development policy generally

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ We also believe AusAID needs to establish an Innovation Development Fund, to  support ground-breaking new ideas to improve aid effectiveness

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ We are also proposing a Pacific Development Trust, which has already been  endorsed by the Foreign Minister of Papua New Guinea. The Trust’s aims would  be to assist individuals and families at the grassroots level to access microcredit,  and to provide training and mentoring for those managing microenterprises.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Finally, Labor also believes we should establish a Global Development Institute,  modelled on the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, to introduce greater  contestability into our development policy.

Australia should be a leader on development issues.

This is a moral imperative, and it is enlightened self-interest.

We have a clear choice as Australians.

We can say a world where so many children die each year because of extreme poverty is  acceptable, that that’s just the way of the world. Or we can say we’re better than that.

Labor  is  committed  to  doing  everything  we  can  to  end  extreme  global  poverty  this   generation.

Labor has a proud tradition of reaching out to those less fortunate than ourselves. When  Chifley gave his ‘Light on the Hill’ speech he wasn’t just talking about helping people in  Australia. He said, ‘We have a great objective - the light on the hill - which we aim to  reach by working for the betterment of mankind not only here but anywhere we may give  a helping hand.’

It’s time for Australia to be a leader on development issues.

It’s time for Australia to help make extreme poverty history.



Thank you.
