E&OE……………………….…………………………………………………………………

TONY ABBOTT:

Thank you for coming out today. I want to particularly thank my friend and colleague Steve Irons, the local  member, for his hard work in getting together a wide range of community representatives to talk to me about  their issues.

As I tried to make clear at the forum today, government can’t solve everyone’s problem but it can and must  avoid making people’s problems worse, and that is the real problem with the Government’s tax agenda. This  is a big taxing Government and it’s a Government which is going to punish the people of Western Australia  in particular with its carbon tax and its mining tax and I really think that the Government must think again  about the impact of its taxes on the people of Western Australia, on their cost of living and on their jobs  because they’re at risk from this Government’s carbon tax and mining tax.

I probably should also say that things are looking grim on Christmas Island. It does seem that we have a  detention system in crisis. It’s bad and it’s getting worse. It’s getting worse because this Government can’t  stop the boats. Now, the only way to avoid the kind of problems that we are seeing in our detention centres  is for the Government to change policies, to put in place the kinds of policies that have worked before -  policies that weren’t always popular but they did stop the boats, they did prevent the deaths, they did prevent  the riots. The only way to stop the deaths and stop the riots is to stop the boats, and that’s the policy that we  recommend to the Government.

QUESTION:

Are you concerned that by setting up the onshore detention facilities, they’ll be simply importing the  problems from Christmas Island?

TONY ABBOTT:

It doesn’t matter where the detention centres are; if they’re full of unhappy people, there are going to be  problems. Now, I think it’s much better to have these detention centres offshore than onshore but the only  way you can start closing down detention centres everywhere is to stop the boats and that is what the

Howard Government did. That’s what this Government could do if it was prepared to put the right policies  in place.

QUESTION:

The Australian Federal Police has used tear gas on asylum seekers during a violent protest there. Do you  think that’s appropriate?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think that the police would be acting in accordance with the ordinary standards of policing. Now, I’m not  going to be critical of the AFP. I just think that when you’ve got very difficult situations inevitably they’re  difficult to respond to and the only way to handle this, as I said, in the end, is to try to ensure we have far  fewer people in detention, eventually no-one in immigration detention, and that means taking much stronger  action, that means changing policies to stop the boats.

QUESTION:

Do you understand the concerns of Northam residents about the facility there given what’s happened on  Christmas Island?

TONY ABBOTT:

I very much understand that the people of Australia were told going into the election that there would be no  new onshore detention centres, that there would be this big new offshore detention centre in East Timor.  That’s what the Government said before the election. That’s turned out to be yet another act of deception by  the Gillard Government because since the election, plainly there isn’t going to be an East Timor detention  centre but there are detention centres opening all the time onshore in flagrant breach of an election promise.  It’s another act of political dishonesty by this Government.

QUESTION:

The latest Nielsen poll shows the Government still down in the doldrums but that you’re being outpolled by  Malcolm Turnbull as preferred leader. Do you feel secure in your job?

TONY ABBOTT:

I don’t comment on the polls. I prefer to look at the field evidence and the field evidence is that the  Australian public know that this is a wasteful, incompetent government which doesn’t keep its promises and  I know, because the Australian people are telling me this, that above all else what they don’t like is a bad tax  based on a lie. I think that’s what the field evidence is telling me and that’s what I’m focused on.

QUESTION:

Your party is getting traction but it doesn’t appear, according to the polls, that you are.

TONY ABBOTT:

As I said, my job, which I do every day, is to be an effective critic of bad policy and to be a credible  alternative and I’m doing that every day.

QUESTION:

Do you think the Coalition could win if Malcolm Turnbull was leader?

TONY ABBOTT:

As I said, my job, every day between now and the next election, is to be an effective critic of bad policies  and to be a credible alternative. Now, I’m happy with the way things are going and I’ll keep doing that job.

QUESTION:

[Inaudible] the situation in Japan, Mr Abbott, with the problems that they’re having with their nuclear  reactors, do you believe that this is going to have some sort of detrimental effect on the uranium industry  and, also, the prospect down the track that nuclear may be the way to go in Australia?

TONY ABBOTT:

I obviously support Australia’s uranium exports and I think they should continue. I don’t have any policies  for nuclear power in this country.

QUESTION:

[Inaudible] are we doing enough to help Japan?

TONY ABBOTT:

I’m really pleased to see that we’ve already got search and rescue teams in Japan. They are highly trained  professionals. Many of them have been hard at work, both in the floods here in Australia and more recently  in Christchurch and I think that they’re eager to continue to be of assistance and I’m sure they’ll be doing  everything they humanly can to help people in Japan.

QUESTION:

Do you think that the situation in Japan with their nuclear reactors will influence the debate in Australia  about nuclear power?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, that’s a debate that will unfold but, as I said, the Coalition has no policy to promote nuclear power in  this country.

QUESTION:

Does the fact that Malcolm Turnbull is outpolling you and he supports an ETS, does that show that the  Australian public does have an appetite for wearing some of the hardship when combating climate change?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think the public will want to see us with a strong environmental policy and the Coalition does have a strong  environmental policy. We will reduce emissions by planting more trees, by fostering better soils and by  using smarter technology, not by putting a great big hit on people’s cost of living, not by adding $300 a year  to people’s power bills, not by adding six and a half cents to people’s petrol bills.

QUESTION:

On a local issue, airport noise, you said in the forum that the people of Perth should get the same solutions  as the people of Sydney but a couple of weeks ago Premier Colin Barnett basically said that the people who  live there need to just deal with the noise. Will you be speaking with him about that?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, this is a federal issue. It’s not really a state issue and I think that where you’ve got the same problems,  you should have the same solutions.

QUESTION:

Why do you think your approval rating has dropped and Julia Gillard is still preferred as PM?

TONY ABBOTT:

As I said, my job every day between now and the next election is to be an effective critic of bad policy and  I’ve got to say there’s been a lot of bad policy to criticise. A hell of a lot of bad policy to criticise, a hell of a  lot of deception and dishonesty, waste and incompetence from this Government and I’ll be out there every  day between now and the next election criticising that which deserves to be criticised but also presenting  effective policies so that the Australia public can be sure that if there is a change of government, they can  trust the Coalition with their future.

Thank you so much. Thanks very much.
