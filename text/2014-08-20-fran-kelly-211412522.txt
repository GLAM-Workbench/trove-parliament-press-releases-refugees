THE HON RICHARD MARLES MP  SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND BORDER  PROTECTION  MEMBER FOR CORIO

E&OE TRANSCRIPT  INTERVIEW with FRAN KELLY - ABC RADIO NATIONAL - BREAKFAST  WEDNESDAY 20 AUGUST 2014



SUBJECT/S: Children in detention; Reports of people being charged over  the death of Reza Barati



JOURNALIST - FRAN KELLY: Richard Marles is the Shadow Minister for  Immigration and he joins us now, Richard Marles thank you very much for joining us  on Breakfast.

RICHARD MARLES, SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND BORDER  PROTECTION:  Good morning Fran how are you?

KELLY:  I’m well thank you, yesterday you described Scott Morrison’s  announcement that children will be removed from detention as baffling, I would  have thought a better word was welcome?



MARLES:  Well having kids out of detention is obviously a welcome development,  the truth is Fran, every government should be doing all that it can to get kids out of  detention and from 2010 Labor was doing that and as a result of the steps we took,  literally hundreds of children were taken out of detention and put in the community,  I make the point that at the time Scott Morrison was critical of those effort as a

waste of resources.  What I find baffling is that it has taken Scott Morrison 12  months to realise that his Government should be doing precisely the same, and if  there is an admission in all of this, that there’s been nothing happening on this front  over the last 12 months, well then that’s actually a total disgrace.



KELLY:  Well there’s no such admission, we just heard the Minister last night say  that the hold up has been getting in place the supports that children need, the  supports that Labor didn’t put in place, things like support for housing for instance.

MARLES:  Well what we heard yesterday was a lot of spin, it is not clear to me  exactly what decision was taken by the Minister yesterday that he was announcing,  there’s no detail around on what extra support there is, there’s no extra detail about  what extra capacity there is, I heard that clip that you just played then, I mean  transport, schooling, all of this ought to be provided already, and nor do we have  any explanation of why or what is the advice which suggests that this should only be  applying to children who are under ten, I think what we’re seeing here -

KELLY:  Is that a change, children under 10 is a new benchmark in this area?

MARLES:  Well I’ve never heard that age be used before in determining whether or  not people should be taken out of detention so I’d be very keen to understand  exactly what is the advice which is focussing on that age group, but this is a man  who seems to be making a lot of noise, there’s a lot of movement, and it’s all  happening in the very weeks that for the first time he is appearing before the  Human Rights Commission’s Inquiry into Children in Detention.

KELLY:  Do you think that’s what this announcements all about?

MARLES:  I have no doubt that this is what’s going on here, I mean we’ve heard  nothing from this Minister in the last 12 months which indicates the slightest shred  of compassion on his part for the plight of children in detention until he is to face  this inquiry on Friday and we see effectively a confected announcement which really  ought to be business as usual and it’s not business as usual and it’s baffling.

KELLY:  But what about Labor’s compassion though, it’s qualified, I mean the  obvious problem for those concerned about children in detention is the fact that all  those kids that arrived after Labor’s offshore processing policy was announced last  July will be left to languish on Christmas Island or in Nauru in conditions we know  absolutely now for a fact are not safe for children, are doing children harm, but you  continue to support that policy.

MARLES:  Well we support the model of offshore processing -

KELLY:  Which allows children, which means that children stay in detention for  indefinite periods in places like Nauru.

MARLES:  Well it ought not be indefinite and let me answer the question you’ve  asked Fran, we do support  the model of offshore processing because it’s playing a  very important role in saving lives at sea and we saw lots and lots of people, more  than 1000 die, over a period of about 30 months, many of whom were children and  offshore processing touch wood we hope, has got to a point now where the deaths  at sea have ended.  But none of that is a licence for those facilities to be operating  as hell holes, if there are circumstances such as this where children are in detention  then these facilities need to be operating at world’s best practice.

KELLY:  It is impossible though for us to ever, I mean the experts tell you, the  psychological experts will tell you that children kept in detention in places like

Christmas Island and Nauru, it is not good for them, are you as the Shadow  Immigration Minister at ease in your mind and in your conscience that we Australia,  the Government, is leaving kids in these kinds of conditions?

MARLES:  The conditions that children are in now offshore, leave me with a great  sense of concern, and when you use the word indefinite, I completely agree that for  children to be in indefinite detention is an appalling situation -

KELLY:  Well it was Labor’s policy the no advantage policy.

MARLES:  Which is absolutely not the same as indefinite detention, but the  important point to make here Fran is that these facilities need to be operating at  world’s best practice, they need to be providing children with schooling, with  counselling, it’s got to be clear that there is an end point in children being in  detention and we can have no sense of confidence that that’s what’s occurring right  now and this is a Government which has a woeful track record when it comes to  transparency in the area of asylum seeker policy, what we need to be hearing from  the Minister is an assurance that the way in which Nauru is operating is providing  facilities and services which are at world’s best practice.

KELLY:  Richard Marles the Minister Scott Morrison also made it clear last night that  he has some hope that the cross benches will support him in re-introducing  temporary protection visas, let’s have a listen

“The cross benches are very well aware of the terrible legacy the Government  has been left with in this area, they want to see children out of detention,  they want to see the detention population reduced, so we can process  people, find out whether they’re refugees or not, if they are refugees, be  putting them on a what the Government says should be a temporary visa and  if they’re not, well obviously they’ll be removed from Australia.”

Now Labor doesn’t support TPV’s have you been speaking to the cross benches  about this policy?

MARLES:  We’ve begun the process of speaking to the cross benches in relation to  this Fran but I make the point that there is nothing stopping the Government right  now from getting people out of detention in Australia and beginning the system of  processing, determining as the Minister said, whether or not people are genuine or  whether or not they ought to be facilitated back home, all of that could be occurring  right now and the only reason it isn’t, is because when Labor said that we did not  warrant temporary protection visas as an acceptable policy, essentially what you  had, was the Minister, in an act of petulance closing up shop and refusing last year  to engage in any kind of processing at all.  Now nothing stopping the Minister other  than his own pride from doing this right now and we know that the policy of  temporary protection visas is a flawed policy, it was effectively abandoned by John  Howard towards the end of his time in Government, it puts people in a suspended  state of limbo, and it prevents people from actively engaging in our society and it is

a recipe to have a large number of marginalised people within our community which  is in no one’s interest.

KELLY:  Richard Marles just finally can I just ask you about the other news in this  area, the news yesterday that two people that were employed by the security  company G4S have been charged with the murder of Reza Barati, the asylum seeker  in Manus back in February, there is some confusion whether one of those is the  Salvation Army worker the Minister referred to at the time, there’s also news this  morning that they are also, the police are also looking for two ex-patriots, in relation  to this murder, can you shed any light on these facts?

MARLES:  No I can’t, well no extra light than what is in the media, and again we  need to be hearing from the Minister in relation to this, but this is a welcome  development that we’re hearing from PNG, it is really important that those who were  responsible for the death of Reza Barati be held to account, I think it appalled every  Australian to see somebody lose their life in a facility that is being funded and in  large measure being run by the Australian Government, and it is very important that  ultimately people are brought to justice in regard to this terrible event.

KELLY:  Richard Marles thank you very much for joining us.

MARLES:  Thank you Fran.
