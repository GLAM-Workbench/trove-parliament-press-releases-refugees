Michael Keenan MP - Federal Member for  Stirling 6PR Interview with Rod Tiley December 27, 2012

Topics: illegal boat arrivals / 2013 election

Rod Tiley

The Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and Border Protection Michael Keenan is going to join us in a moment to talk  about his favourite subject, the asylum seeker boats and they keep on coming don’t they. Federal Labor this year  embraced some tough new asylum seeker policies in a bid to stop the boats but so far they haven’t worked. Michael why  not? Good afternoon.

Michael Keenan

Good afternoon Rod good to be with you. I think they haven’t worked for two reasons. I think firstly they introduced  offshore processing, which is a policy they demonised for over a decade and they have done it in a half hearted way. I  think when you have so stridently opposed a policy and then you turn around and implement it then there is a bit of a  credibility gap there and people smugglers pick up on this sort of thing. Secondly they haven’t gone as far as they need to  go, which is to embrace all of the suite of policies that the Howard Government used to stop people smuggling and  unfortunately offshore processing alone is just not going to do the job.

Rod Tiley

But in August the Government did adopt all 22 of the panel’s recommendations? Many of them calling for a return to the  Howard Government era policies?

Michael Keenan

They haven’t adopted all the Howard Government policies and that is the problem.

Rod Tiley

No but they adopted all 22 of the panel’s recommendations didn’t they?

Michael Keenan

No they didn’t. You can argue about how many they have adopted but the panel for instance recommended that they  could turn the boats back around and that would be a very good disincentive for people smuggling if they did that. The  panel said they would need to talk to Indonesia further about that yet they haven’t done anything to progress that  particular recommendation and that is a very important one if you want to send a strong message that we are going to

close down people smuggling. The other thing they must do is temporary protection visas because when the people  smugglers go out into the Middle East and the rest of the world to sell their product, what they are actually selling is  permanent residence to our country. When we say that we will protect you but we will do it on a temporary basis and when  we deny people permanent residence it really does undermine what the people smugglers have to sell.

What about these bridging visas? Wasn't there an announcement in November about bridging visas?

Michael Keenan

What that means is that they are going to release people into the community inexplicitly to live on welfare with no  entitlement to work, which I think is the worst of all worlds for Australia. But it is not a temporary protection visa, there are  some aspects of the temporary protection visa but not the important ones because it is still a stepping stone along the way  to permanent residence to Australia. What you have to do is completely remove the ability for people to get permanent  residence to Australia because that is the reason people are coming her and why they are paying these enormous sums  of money to people smugglers.

Rod Tiley

So you are saying that the anomalies in the policies are the real problem areas and people smugglers are just cashing in  on them?

Michael Keenan

People smugglers are making the sort of money that drug smugglers make. They are not just going to give that up unless  they understand that the Government is deadly serious about stopping them. The problem for the Labor Party is that they  have had so many different policies in Government. They have tried so many different things. They have made a lot of

threats to people smugglers almost all of which haven’t been followed through with and until the people smugglers, who  are making these millions of dollars, look to the Government and say these guys are actually serious about stopping us,  which happened under the Howard Government, we are going to see this continuation of unprecedented rate of arrivals.

Rod Tiley

Yes well this unprecedented wave of arrivals continued yesterday and the day before?

Michael Keenan

That’s right. We had an arrival yesterday on Boxing Day and another one on Christmas Day and as I said these guys are  not going to let up until they look to the Government and see a seriousness of resolve and a determination to implement  policies that are actually going to stop them. Whilst they see half measures and whilst they see people doing things that  they don’t think they are going to back up then they are going to continue to take advantage of that weakness.

Rod Tiley

Talking with Michael Keenan, Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and Border Protection about the onrush of people  smuggling into our country and our waters. Two boats arriving as I said in the last couple of days as the people smugglers  seemingly cash in on the anomaly of policies in the Government. Michael this is going to be no doubt a red-hot election  issue and one that quite justifiably you and other members of the Coalition will keep hammering on in 2013. Do you fear  as we approach the election and people smugglers and there clients realise that the likelihood that we will have a  Coalition Government in Australia after that election period that in the weeks running up to the election that we could see  a lot more boats arriving?

Michael Keenan

That is certainly a possibility. People smugglers are part of very sophisticated criminal networks and they fully understand  what is going on in Australian politics and they understand what the implications of Australian Government decisions are  going to be on their business. They will know all about the election, they will know all about our policies and hopefully they  will get a sense that we are serious about stopping them and they should get that sense because we are. If they think that  is the case then there is the possibility that they will run something of a closing down sale in the lead up to our election

and that could have bad consequences for our country but also for the people who seek to come here.

Rod Tiley

If you get in at the next election and it seems that you are likely to, how quickly can you turn these boats around? Or at  least turn the policy around to try and stop the people smuggling?

Michael Keenan

We will issue orders on day one of the Abbott Government to turn the boats back around. That is just a matter of issuing  orders to the Navy. It doesn’t need to go through the Parliament. The Government will just issue orders to the Navy that  this is now our policy and as soon as that is done the Navy can start implementing their new orders and we would  certainly do that as soon as the government changes, if we get the chance to govern.

Rod Tiley

But you can’t turn all the boats around can you? It just wouldn’t be necessarily able to do that on each and every occasion  there may be people in dire need.

Michael Keenan

No the decisions would have to be made on the ground and that is what happened when it was implemented last time  when the Howard Government implemented this policy and they turned around half a dozen boats which doesn’t sound  like a lot but that of course is in the context of 3 boats arriving on any given year. What it did was send a very strong  message when a boat left Indonesia and was returned to that same port within a short space of time. That sends an  enormous message to would be people smugglers and the people that might use their services that the Australian  Government was now really serious about stopping them from getting to Australia. It is a very powerful deterrent but you  are right it cannot always be done and clearly we would never do it if it was going to adversely affect somebodies safety  but it can be done safely and when it is done safely it sends a very powerful message.

Rod Tiley

Michael how confident are you about winning the election?

Michael Keenan

I get a lot of feedback from my electorate that people are pretty disenchanted with this Government. The Labor Party  hasn’t even been about to do simple things effectively. I think it is very important that we win this election but clearly it is  going to be a good fight because it always is in the Federal election. It is a tough contest and this year will be a battle  between us and the Labor Party.

Rod Tiley

Does it concern you that Tony Abbott doesn’t appear to be as popular as you would like him to be or need him to be going  into the election?

Michael Keenan

No it doesn’t. I think Tony is a very effective Opposition Leader and he has done a very good job at unifying the Party and  making us a competitive force. The fact is that we are ahead in the polls, we don’t obsess about the polls, but the fact is  that we are ahead in most of the published polls and I think that is a testament to Tony’s skill.

Rod Tiley

But if he was more popular personally then you would be even further in front?

Michael Keenan

It is a tough gig being Opposition Leader and the nature of the job is that it is quite a negative job in a sense because your  job is to hold the Government to account and that involves a lot of criticism of what they are doing. I think he has done that  very effectively and he has led an Opposition that has done that very effectively. We have been able to highlight where the  Government has gone wrong and of course we haven’t had a shortage of material there because they are the worst  Government in living memory.

Rod Tiley

Yeah but because of the fact that he has to do that negative role he has earned the nickname of doctor no and that may  well have played against him as far as the polls are concerned because people see him as doctor no don’t they?

Michael Keenan

That is the way the Government has tried to frame him. There has been a lot of things for us not to agree to in this minority Parliament because a lot of the suggestions coming out of the Government such as the Carbon Tax were not good  suggestions for our country so we were never going to support them. It is a tough job. It is inevitably takes a toll on the  person who is doing it in the sense that if you are constantly holding the Government to account then that can reflect on  the way people perceive you. But he is a very strong leader. He will be an excellent Prime Minister if you give him the  opportunity to be Prime Minister and I believe the Australian people will certainly warm to him over time.

Rod Tiley

This shadow portfolio that you have been carrying as the Shadow Minister for Customs and Border Protection and I think  you are also acting in Justice to or Immigration at the moment?

Michael Keenan

No my normal portfolio is Justice, Customs and Border Protection and I am acting in Immigration and Citizenship at the  moment.

Rod Tiley

Yes that’s right so you have a lot on your plate at the moment. Is this the portfolio you would want in government? Or do  you have another choice that would be your preference?

Michael Keenan

I would certainly like to see this through but in our Party that is always up to the leader so it would be up to Tony Abbott to  allocate portfolios and I wouldn’t seek to advise him about that. I just do the best job that I can and he will obviously make  those decisions if we get a chance to form government.

But do you see some brownie points for Michael Keenan as a Minister for Customs and Border Protection if all of a  sudden the boats are being turned around? Your political kudos would go up enormously.

Michael Keenan

I would like to see a result for our country. I think it is very important that we have a resolution to this because we can’t  afford this problem to spiral out of control as it has done over the last few years. The consequences are very significant in  terms of the cost to the Australian community; in terms of the perception people have to the immigration system as a  program and also for the people making the journey themselves. It is a terribly dangerous journey. Hundreds of people  have died and we need to stop people from taking it. So I do think it is very important that we get a resolution to this.

Rod Tiley

It is important for us to realise to, as you say, that hundreds of people have died. We hear about the boats but  unfortunately we don’t hear about all the boats because some of them have sunk before we even know they have been on  the water?

Michael Keenan

There is plenty of evidence that boats have left Indonesia and nobody knows what ever happened to them. There is no  question about what we do know that there has been hundreds of people lose their lives and it would probably be a lot  greater number than that.

Rod Tiley

Thank you for your time Michael.

Michael Keenan

Good to talk to you Rod.
