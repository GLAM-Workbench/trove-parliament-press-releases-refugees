STATEMENT - UPDATE ON COMMUNITY DETENTION

The Federal Government is continuing to move children and vulnerable families out of  detention facilities, with more than 1,670 people currently residing in community-based  accommodation.

As at 22 March 2012, more than 3,400 people have been granted community detention  since Prime Minister Julia Gillard and I announced the expansion of the program in  October 2010.



There are over 630 children in and transitioning into community detention arrangements  - 63 per cent of all asylum seeker children.

Of these, 193 are unaccompanied minors (UAMs) - that means all eligible UAMs who  arrived in Australia prior to 7 December 2011 have been moved into community  arrangements.

All eligible accompanied children who arrived in Australia prior to 20 November 2011  have been moved into community arrangements.

The small number of children who arrived prior to these dates and who remain in  detention are not eligible for community detention due to security, behaviour or risk  requirements.

This Government recognises the importance of the community detention program, which  has been particularly successful in providing appropriate care for people - especially  children - accommodated in the community while their asylum claims are assessed.

People who are approved for community detention are the most vulnerable in the  detention network because they are children, families with children, or because they  have serious mental or physical health issues or have suffered torture and trauma.

As always, I would like to thank organisations such as the Australian Red Cross for the  ongoing work they do with the Department of Immigration and Citizenship in  maintaining this program.
