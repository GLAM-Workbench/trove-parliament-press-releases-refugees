AID FOR 
BURMESE REFUGEES

Â

I am pleased to announce additional relief funds 
of over $1.1 million to assist refugees who have returned to Burma.

Â

The funds will support the World Food Programme's 
relief and rehabilitation activities leading to the eventual rehabilitation 
of the refugees.

Â

Since 1991, a total of 225,000 refugees fled Burma 
for the sanctuary of camps located along the country's borders with 
Bangladesh and Thailand. The vast majority of them have since returned 
with the assistance of international agencies.

Â

Australia will also contribute $169,000 towards funding 
a CARE Australia project to assist refugees returning to their homelands.

Â

These funds will be used to help the returnees implement 
Agroforestry systems which both contribute to their subsistence and 
income needs while improving natural resource management.

Â

The Australian Government is prepared to share the 
burden of refugee relief and encourages Burma's Government - the State 
Peace and Development Council - to take steps to improve the observance 
of human rights in Burma, which is the underlying cause of the refugee 
problem.

Â

In early February I announced an Australian contribution 
of $500,000 to assist 21,000 Rohingyan refugees remaining in camps on 
the Bangladesh/Burma border. These funds are being used to provide clean 
water, food, sanitation and shelter.

Â

Since the refugee problem began Australia has contributed 
$8.8 million to the international relief effort to purchase food, medicines 
and other relief items.
