Government fails own privacy laws  ***For immediate release***

Friday, February 21, 2014

DLP Senator for Victoria John Madigan has called for the government to comply with its own privacy laws and  heavily prosecute those responsible for making the personal details of asylum seekers public.

Senator Madigan said the Immigration Minister Scott Morrison was treating the security breach like a clerical  error, rather than accepting the gravity of the situation and averting the real consequences.

“It’s all good and well to pay money to KPMG to make sure this doesn’t happen again, but what is going to  happen to the families of those now in our protection,” Senator Madigan said.

“The government is not being consistent in its approach. In one breath they express concern about people  coming here and the situations they have left. But after their personal details are made public, the  government expresses zero concern about the lives of people we have consequently put in greater jeopardy.

“I think the government fails to take into account the horrors these asylum seekers have escaped from.

“Our government needs to understand asylum seekers are not a problem to be dealt with, but individuals   who need our protection.

“We are being naive if we think rebel groups and foreign governments bent on oppression are not using every  means to gather information on who has escaped their grasp. Threatening, torturing, raping and murdering  those left behind is common, and I fear this cock-up by the department has delivered information into the  wrong hands.

“Our government needs to implement a solution. This must not happen again.

“All asylum seekers in Australia deserve a guarantee the Australian Government will protect them and their  private information.”
