MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND MULTICULTURAL AFFAIRS LABOR’S SECRET IMMIGRATION POLICY

Labor is steadfastly refusing to release an immigration policy.

This is the clearest indication the Australian people have that Mr Beazley has neither the will nor the capacity to keep the Government’s tough border protection legislation.

In an insert in today’s Southern Gazette Community Newspaper, the Labor Candidate for Swan, Kim Wilkie, declares that Labor will "overhaul our border protection laws".

Mr Beazley is afraid to commit himself to a policy to match the Government’s because he knows he won’t be allowed to.

Twenty-nine identified ALP MP’s, members and candidates are backing away from Mr Beazley’s commitment to the Government’s tough measures.

Mr Beazley is saying one thing nationally, while ALP members are saying another thing locally.

If Mr Beazley wins government on Saturday, he will roll-back Australia’s tough border protection measures.

Mr Beazley will once again land illegal entrants on the mainland.

Mr Beazley will allow full access to appeals mechanisms.

Mr Beazley will roll-back the judicial review legislation and we will once again see failed asylum seekers tie up taxpayer funds and the courts time while they delay their inevitable removal.

Mr Beazley will see the immigration program blow out as the Labor Party once again returns to the failed policies of the eighties which saw high levels of unemployment and welfare dependency amongst new migrants.

Mr Beazley will wind back bona-fides testing and the immigration program will once again be characterised by rorts, scams and cheats.

Where’s your policy Mr Beazley?
