AUSTRALIA AND CHILE-----ALMOST TWO HUNDRED YEARS AFTER"

.  CHILE - AUSTRALIA

Chile has been known to the Western World a lot longer

than has Australia.

With a population (lOMillion) similar to that of Â·

Australians, Chile has had a long history of relationship

with Australia stemming from the pioneering days when ships

in routeÂ· from England, withi.pioneers, victualled at Chilean

Ports. Some, left the ships there never to continue on . '

to A u s t r a l i a w h i l e  at the same time in reverse, Australian

miners flocked to Chile after the gold mining boom faded .

here to mine silver, copper and later nitrates. . Â·  -  .

As well, early Australian scientists and pastoralists

went to Chile in the early years of Australian settlement

to bring back plants and animals from Chile. ’  .  .

Llamas care with horses cattle and sheep and its been

Chile i n  a  load of stock fodder. .  .  .  .  .

The Chilean climate and the Australian climate is very

similar onlynir rainforests are in. the north while

yours .  are in the South..  .  . .  .  ,  . . .  .  . . .  .  .  .

At. a time when Australian settlers were forcibly disposing

of its Governor of the time - Captain Bligh in 1810 -

Chile was taking its first step in the long hard road .  .  Ã¢ÂÂ¢

to National independence. ,  .

An uprising following the calling o f  a special

meeting in 1510 to seek obeisance to Napoleon

against the raninsular Spanish led to the first

concerted move for independence. The meeting

was called b y  the Governor of Chile - the Captain

General. Ã¢ÂÂ   .  '  Ã¢ÂÂ   Ã¢ÂÂ

In 1311. Chile convened its first national congress, "  ""

which issued an edict banning slavery, the first

country to do so in the Americas!', w h i l e .in Australia

the debate was just developing on the need for a separate

nation, and an end to transportation. .  ;  ,  . . .

Chile's first constitution, proposed b y  Martinez R o j a s ,.

was modelled on the US constitution, from which the '  .

Australian constitution draws many of its principles.

.Its also interesting -  to note that among.your revolutionary

Ã¢ÂÂ¢.heroes, many sons of Irish migrants played a large

The production patterns in both our countries are similar

mining development, agriculture and a widening industrial

b a s e .

vve have very similar attitudes - the opposition to the

nuclear testing programme the growth of our neighbours

through social and e c o n o m i c .development as well as the

cultivation of the Pacific as a zone of peace. .  .

In the past, Australia has looked to Europe, and to SouthÂ­

.  East A.sia. .  .  .  Ã¢ÂÂ

We have not developed enough the relationships between

our two continents.Â· '  Â·  '  Ã¢ÂÂ   '

This has been a fault of Australia. You are our neighbour

and I believe we should develop closely our relations in

foreign affairs, in trade and in the interchange of people

Some of your ccunorymen came here as refugees in recent

y e a r s .  .  .  '

As Australians we welcome them.

JThe.-1er ms Â·; and -cczri.itions, 'of 'their entry and stay' here need,

to be set out and clearly u n d e r s t o o d .  .

Recently, the Prim—  Minister has been involved in a

shoddy mistreatmerrc of refugees from Indo-China.

We see our responsibilities as an affluent c o u n t r y ’in

accepting defined numbers and under clearly stated

guidelines.

We would apply these irrespective of the country of their

origin.. .  Â·  '  .

relationships with, Chile h ave b e e n  dislocated. - "I refer

""to "the" waterside workers bah on the loading of: wheat to

Chile. .. .  .  .

Trade embargoes, particularly three on foodstuffs are

both clumsy and inappropriate weepers for censuring

disliked policies of another c o u r r r y .

Tragically, if enforced i t 's the weak and the hungry who

suffer the most. .

We would therefore seek to m a i n t a i n  free and open trade with

..all countries of the world other than those, where

U n i t e d 'Nations restraints require some other c o u r s e .

Certainly with. Chile ,  thereÂ·.is reason, t o 'develop natural

trade o p p o r tunities. ;  .  Â·

At the time of the wheat ban's a p p l i c a t i o n ,  T condemned

it and I condemn it now. Chile has always been a .

reliable trading partner of Australia and for a group .

of left wing unionists to disrupt orade with one c o u n t r y ,

even though they possess no electoral m a n d a t e ,  threatens

the stability of democracy in Au S o m a l i a ,  and, overlooks the

fact that we. h a v e  traded with Chile irrespective .

of the nature of the Government in power.. Â·  .

Wheat is ::r feeding people not for political

tomfoolery cm tie part of some power hungary unionists
