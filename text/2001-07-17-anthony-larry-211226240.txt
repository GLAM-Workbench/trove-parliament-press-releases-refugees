75 WAYS TO STRONGER FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES

Communities across Australia are starting to receive practical help under the Government's $240 million Stronger Families and Communities Strategy Minister for Community Services, Larry Anthony said today.

To date more than $8 million has been committed to 75 practical projects, including:

Ã¢ÂÂÃ¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»A national project to develop a scouting movement in indigenous communities encouraging young indigenous people to become actively involved in their communities,

Ã¢ÂÂÃ¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»A support program for men facing economic and social pressures in Nambucca Heads, NSW,

Ã¢ÂÂÃ¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»A community garden in Townsville, QLD, to help break the social isolation felt by many older people and recent migrants and refugees,

Ã¢ÂÂÃ¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»A parenting support program in Adelaide, SA, for families affected by brain injury,

Ã¢ÂÂÃ¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»A sports mentoring program in the ACT to help young vulnerable people feel part of the community.

Ã¢ÂÂÃ¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»Initiatives in the Northern Territory and Western Australia which connect young indigenous people with elders in their communities.

"There is much more to come with another 600 projects in the pipeline.

"The Stronger Families and Community Strategy is a clear example of what can be achieved when Government and the community work together. We recognise that local people are best placed to come up with solutions to local problems.

"The Strategy focuses on early intervention and prevention and will help communities to tackle issues head on before they become a big problem.

"This will empower people and communities with new skills and strengths to move forward together," Mr Anthony said.

A list of projects is attached.
