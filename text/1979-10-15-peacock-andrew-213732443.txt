.  AUSTRALIA AND SOUTH EAST ASIA Â·

The topic you have chosen for your seminar is a timely

one. South East Asia has long been important to Australia but

has become even far more so because we are now entering a n'ew

era. For this reason, I think you are right to look not just at

the present but at the future. What is happening now will set the

pattern for Australia's future relations with this vast and fastÂ­

changing region. The future is one which presents Australia with

both challenges and opportunities. We can grow and prosper in

harmony and co-operation with our neighbours or we can wither

and decline in not very splendid isolation. The choice is ours.

In looking at changes and developments in our region,

and at our responses to them, I intend to concentrate on the

five nations which make up the Association of South East Asian

Nations (ASEAN). All Australian Governments since the end of

World War II have placed a high priority on relations with these

five countries but in recent years the nature of that' relationÂ­

ship has been changing. In the 1950s and 1960s defence considerÂ­

ations dominated the relationship. There was certainly recognition

in some quarters of the need to get close to our Asian neighbours,

but Australians in general probably tended to interpret this to

mean that the neighbours should adapt to us rather than we to them.

Those days are gone.

.  Today, the ASEAN countries are taking a very hard headed

look at the world around them, including neighbours like us. As

events in Indo China constantly remind us., the- politico-strategic

elements of our relations cannot be forgotten and scope exists

for further co-operation in this field. But, despite the reality

and importance of Kampuchea and Vietnamese refugees, economic ’ Â·Â·Ã¢ÂÂ  -‘Â·Â· Ã¢ÂÂ   .

matters have become a major component of our relationship in a way

that they were not before. We should never forget that the day .

to day preoccupation of all ASEAN govestiinents is the economic and '

social development of their people and this is reflected in their

-.-/2

approach to the outside world. They want markets for their

products and investment to help build new industries. Their

political and defence policies are aimed at leaving them in

peace to get on with that job without interference from outsiders, .

Indo China

The situation in Indo China is of vital concern to

Australia and to the ASEAN countries alike. Our interests are

similar and we have worked closely together. The Vietnamese

invasion of Kampuchea, Soviet support for Vietnam, the Chinese

incursion into Vietnam and the massive exodus of refugees have

all had a most adverse effect on regional stability as well as

creating internal problems for some of the countries of the

region. The introduction of great power rivalry into South East

Asia is not a welcome development. While there are limits to

what Australia and the ASEAN countries can achieve, we must do

everything in our power to minimise the adverse effects of these

events and, above all, to help the innocent victims. It is

important that countries like Australia continue to support the

efforts of the ASEAN countries which have acted with courage

and responsibility in confronting these problems,

Australia has acted on,two fronts: the strictly

political and the humanitarian. We have made great efforts to

promote international awareness of the destabilising effects on

the region of the continued conflict in Kampuchea and of the

need for a negotiated and lasting settlement of the dispute; a

settlement which will allow the long-suffering people of Kampuchea

to determine their own future. We have also been active in trying

..... /‘ 3

to get Vietnam to cease its intervention in Kampuchea. We

supported an ASEAN sponsored resolution in the Security Council

which called for an immediate ceasefire and the withdrawal of all

foreign troops from Kampuchea and Vietnam. We are currently

working in the United Nations with the ASEAN countries to .  Ã¢ÂÂ

establish the principles and groundwork for a political solution

which will achieve the withdrawal of external forces and a

settlement worked out by the Kampuchean people themselves.. We

will continue to do what we can to prevent the escalation of

great power rivalry in the region and to bring pressure on

Vietnam to live at peace with its neighbours. The stability ot

this region is not an academic question for Australians. It is

one which vitally affects the part of the world we live in. In

addition to famine, disease, loss of life and refugees' suffering,

there is a danger that the fighting will spread into the

surrounding region either as a r'esult of the flow of refugees

into Thailand or of a deterioration in Chinese/Vietnamese relations

As well as the threat of expanded hostilities, there is a further

danger of an increased Soviet presence in Indo China.

On the humanitarian front, you will know that the

Australian Government has given relief assistance to the starving

people of Kampuchea and has been active in persuading other

countries to do so too. When I was in\lew York recently I

made strong and I think successful representations to

Mr Waldheim for him to appeal for wider support from other

countries. You will also be aware of the efforts being made by

the Australian Government, dnd by the Australian community, to

resettle substantial numbers of refugees from Vietnam and

Kampuchea. We have taken more refugees on a pro rata basis than

any other country in the world and we will continue to accept as

many as we reasonably can of these pebple both in the interests -

of humanity and in O ur own interests. .  For let us not lose

sight of the fact that they are proving to be excellent migrants

who will contribute much to Australian society. Â·

Internationally, the refugee problem rpmains the most

pressing problem facing South East Asian' governments. It has

precipitated serious political and economic tensions in the area.Â·

A

It has imposed heavy financial and social burdens on the co'untrie—

of first asylum and diverted resources from developmental .

projects. It is a threat to regional* stability. Â·  '

International pressures, in which we played a prominent

role, have slowed the outflow of refugees and Australia's policy

remains directed to solving the problem at its source. ‘  We look

to the Government of Vietnam to abide by the undertakings it

gave at Geneva and to make sustained and serious efforts to

resolve this problem in all its aspects. Australia recognises

that all people should have the right to emigrate. However,

we also recognise the right of individuals to stay in their own

country without discrimination and the right of governments to

control immigration.

ASEAN Â·

I have already referred to the importance the Government

attaches to Australia's relations with the ASEAN countries.

While these bilateral relationships are long standing and predate

the formation of ASEAN in 1967, the growth of that Association

has been one of the most significant developments in South East

Asia over the pa^st decade.

The growing custom of consultation and cooperation

between the ASEAN countries, and the international recognition

of ASEAN reinforce our need for a close relationship. Besides

broadly similar geo-political and strategic perceptions, we

share with ASEAN countries an attachment to basically free

enterprise economies and a commitment to freedom of commerce

and communication. It is thus very much in Australia's interest

to support a regional association whose success in pursuing

these objectives contributes to the attainment of our policy

goals.

Our relationship is already close. In 1974 Australia

became the first country to establish formal ties with ASEAN.

Since then a framework has been deveiop^d in which we regularly

consult’with the five members, collectively or separately on a

wide range of issues.  The Prime K Inis ter met with AS'-..AN Heads

5,

of Government after their last summit meeting in 1977.' Just

four months ago I became the- first Australian Foreign Minister

to meet collectively with ASEAN Foreign Ministers following

their annual discussions. An ASEAN-Australia Forum brings '  .

together senior officials from both sides every year and there

are a series of more regular consultations mainly on economic

matters but also, overseas, on international questions. We have Â·

recently almost doubled our commitments under the ASEAN-Australia

Economic Co-operation Program to $29 million. >

Some very welcome efforts are being made to broaden and

deepen relations with ASEAN outside the Governmental network.

Late last month an Australian Parliamentary delegation attended,

as observers, the General Assembly of the ASEAN Inter-Parliamentary

Organisation. I understand that as a result of recent efforts,

formal links are likely to be established in the near future

between the ASEAN and Australian business sectors.

Clearly then, there is a regular and ongoing pattern of

consultation which advances our relationship in a way which is

not often publicly recognised. It is the problems which get the

publicity - although I would not want to suggest that we have

no problems. I do however very strongly suggest that they are

all problems which are capable of solution and which - in many

cases - are in the process of being solved. The ICAP dispute

is one such problem. We did have differences of view with the

ASEAN countries but as a result of patient negotiation on both

sides I am confident that this problem can be solved. Australian

and ASEAN officials are to meet later this month to discuss

further the details of a package which has been agreed on in .

essence by both ASEAN and Australian Ministers. This could

permit the rapid introduction of cheap fares between ASEAN and

Australian cities. .  Â·

Economic Relations .

I would like to devote the rest of my remarks to what I

see as possibly the most important long term aspects of .

Australia's relations with the region -y the development of our.

economic and trading relations. It, is here that we face our

/

greatest opportunities. It is a topic which I feel will be of

special interest to Young Liberals. It is of interest to the

young because it is something requiring a fresh, unfettered '

approach and because it is something to be carried forward into

the future. ’  It is of interest to liberals because it deals with

matters that touch on the basic tenets of our political and

economic philosophy. .

As we move into the 1980s it. is becoming increasingly

obvious that the economic and trade difficulties experienced

throughout the world for the greater part of this decade will not

quickly disappear. We cannot necessarily assume that there will

be an automatic and rapid return to the steady growth and trade

expansion of the 1950s and 1960s. What we can expect is that

the international trading environment will become increasingly

competitive in the years ahead. We can also foresee an increasinc

tendency by nations,Â·even those formally committed to global

trading policies, to seek to strengthen their trading positions

by working through regional or bloc trading arrangements.

Japan's "economic miracle" is well known. We are now

becoming aware of the spectacular economic achievements of

South Korea and Taiwan - South Korea is now Australia's fourth

largest trading partner. What is not so well known and appreciate

in Australia are the changes taking place in the ASEAN countries.

True, some fundamental social and economic problems remain in

some ASEAN countries, but this should not disguise the advances

they are making. In both absolute and per capita terms the

ASEAN countries are in the top third of world growth figures.

Between 1969 and 1978 real GDP increased at an annual rate of

between 5.9 percent in the Philippines and 10.3 percent in

Singapore, even the lowest rate of increase being double that

of the OECD nations. "  .  .

What does this mean in practice? It means a two pronged

approach. One prong is measures to take advantage of the

opportunities offered to Australian exporters’  and the other is

measures to enable Asian countries to sell their wares in

Australia. ‘

n

7.

These countries are taking more and more of our exports,

but let me stress that the prospects for further Australian

exports are not confined to minerals .and agricultural products eve-

though these will form an important base. There are great

prospects in a' vast and expanding market for Australian

entrepreneurs who are prepared to take an imaginative look at

what changes might be made in their existing product range and

who are prepared to give up some immediate profit so as to

increase their market share. The ASEAN countries have over 250

million people whose standard of living is increasing. Because

of proximity as well as historical and political ties,

Australians have a comparative advantage in these countries.

The Government can exhort and it can help but it cannot and should

not do the job for the private sector.

All ASEAN"countries except Singapore buy more from us

than they sell. With this in mind, the Government has taken a

number of measures to help ASEAN countries improve their

penetration of the Australian market. Last year we sponsored an

ASEAN Trade Fair in Sydney and next year a second is to be held

here in Melbourne. We have sponsored an Industrial Co-operation

Conference with the ASEAN countries, and have taken steps to

ensure that there is a better understanding in ASEAN countries

of Australia’s own domestic economic problems and decision making

processes. More recently, my colleague the Minister for Trade

and Resources, Mr Anthony, announced a package of initiatives

for developing countries which will give our neighbours in

particular greater opportunity in the Australian market.

Specifically, to rectify the anomalous situation in which British

exporters have enjoyed a margin of tariff preference over

developing countries, British preferences have been removed from

some 500 tariff items. The value.of trade in these items to

Asian developing countries is around $(A)441 million. A further

expansion of the Australian System of Tariff Preferences for

developing countries will enable our neighbours 'to export to

Australia an additional 66 products under preferential tariff rat

> /8

As Mr Anthony said recently in Bangkok, the Australian Government

seeks to give every product from ASEAN the maximum access to our

market which the economic and political realities in Australia

allow.

More importantly, the Australian Government is committed

in the longer term, to structural adjustment of the economy,

especially in the manufacturing sector. As made clear in the,

Government's decisions on the Crawford Committee Report, we

recognise that this must be gradual, and a‘ t a pace which avoids

undue social and economic disruption. The Government has

accepted that it is in Australia's interests to encourage

economically competitive, export-oriented manufacturing Industrie

which make the best use of our natural resources, skills and

technology. This restructuring is inevitable in any case because

of changing technology - it willÂ· be forced on us even if we try

to resist.

There are positive economic reasons why structural

adjustment and an eventual lowering of protective barriers is

in Australia's national interests. I made earlier reference to

the industrial revolution taking place on our northern doorstep.

If we wish to share in that growth we must respond positively.

We cannot expect to benefit from the opportunities offered by

the economic growth in South East Asia and elsewhere if we do no-

allow the developing countries to expand their trade with

Australia. By gradually lowering the trade barriers on the

products which the South East Asian countries wish to export to

Australia we benefit two ways: we obtain goods at a lower cost

than we can provide them ourselves and, by locking in on a growth

region, we enhance our ability to sell goods to developing A s i a .

Those people in Australia who oppose structural adjustment and

a lowering of protective barriers fail to see the opportunities

of new markets, of new investments,  of new industries and of ne<

types of jobs. The critics forget that economic growth regions

not only export, but import. Just as Australian industries hav

benefited from the expansion of the Japanese and Korean economi

so too we can benefit from economic growth elsewhere in Asia.

If Australia does not make the most of its opportunities, other

countries will. Â· ' Â· Â· '  ' Â·  .  '

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Â· Â· /

There are also fundamental political reasons why we .

should take up the challenge. A peaceful and stable neighbouring .

environment will depend not just on Great Power policies but also

on economic and socialÂ· progress. It is obviously in our interests

to facilitate rather than frustrate sustained economic growth in

the South East Asian region, a region in which we all want to

see peaceful and stable development. If we remain inward looking

and protectionist we cannot hope to maintain forever the close

political relations we have for long enjoyed with eur neighbours.

However, perhaps of even more importance is the fact that the

choice before us goes to the heart of our perception of Australia’s

place in the world. Geographically, we are very close to the

ASEAN countries and there is not one thing we can do to change

that. We cannot move house. In -looking to the future, we must

think in terms of who we are close to not who we  are far away

from. Failure'to do so will see Australia become a largely

irrelevant, backward looking community in the midst of an

economically progressive, forward looking region. Successful

adaptation will lead to economic prosperity and harmonious

relations with our neighbours. But I stress again, that it is

up to us to show the spirit, the desire and the imagination to

achieve these things. The world does not owe us a living but it

will return us a very handsome living if we are prepared to

contribute our share.
