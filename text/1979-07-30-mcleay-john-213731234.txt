The Minister for Administrative Services, John McLeay, today

defended Federal Government emergency assistance loans to

needy Indo-Chinese refugees. .  '  .  /

Mr. McLeay said he was disturbed by Labor Party criticism Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂ¢y n  r of the loan re-settlement scheme, which would provide

assistance to geniunely needy Indo-Chinese refugees settling

in South Australia,

L-

Mr. McLeay said statements by A.L.P. members and others .  ,

criticising the scheme were based on incorrect media reports.

This misunderstanding arose from a recent Brisbane newspaper Ã¢ÂÂ   Â· v  Ã¢ÂÂ  Ã¢ÂÂ  Â·  . ' Â·  Ã¢ÂÂ '

report that $12,000 had been allocated for the Indo-Chinese

,  re-settlement loan scheme in Queensland. Subsequent public

and-media comment indicated that loans of $12,000 were to

be given to individual refugees or refugee families.

"This is not so," Mr. McLeay said, "the maximum loan for a

refugee family unit is $600 and such loans go only to

families genuinely needing them. .  k

"I believe this is the least that we as a Government can

do to assist refugees who have been forced to flee . !

Communist Vietnam, often in tragic circumstances."

Mr McLeay said that South Australia's allocation under _ .  \ '  Â·  '  .  _ '

the scheme, administered by the Indo-Chinese Refugee

Association, was $6,000.

The interest free loans are for up to two years and

repayments go into a revolving fund and therefore become Â·  n

available for other deserving cases.

Mr McLeay said the loans were intended to help IndoÂ­

Chinese refugees move away from hostels into the community

at large, making way for newer arrivals.

This, in fact, resulted in a saving for taxpayers because

it was cheaper to encourage refugees to find their own

accommodation instead of maintaining them in costly

Commonwealth Hostels. .  .

Mr/McLeay said that evidence so far indicated that the /  '  Â·  Â·  Ã¢ÂÂ   *  . Â·  '

refugees were very conscientious in repaying loans.
