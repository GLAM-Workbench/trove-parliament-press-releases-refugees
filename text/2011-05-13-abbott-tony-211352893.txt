E&OE……………………….…………………………………………………………………

JOHN LAWS:

Tony, good morning.

TONY ABBOTT:

Good morning, John.

JOHN LAWS:

A bit of criticism that you were a little light on detail and costings.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, it wasn’t dull and if I’d gone through a cavalcade of figures it might have been a bit dull but there  were, I think, 27 initiatives referred to in the speech and whilst not all of them have been detailed at great  length, many of them were election commitments and there’s certainly been a lot of work done on all of  them and the documents for many of them would be on the Liberal Party website, John.

JOHN LAWS:

Yeah, well that’s fine but not everybody bothers to go to it. It might have been a better idea if you put some  forward. Why didn’t you give specifics on how you’d help middle class Australians because they’re not  necessarily going to go to a website?

TONY ABBOTT:

No they’re not, John but I think they’re capable of understanding that a lot of what politicians say in terms  of their policy is backed up by documents and the detail is there for the people that want to go hunting for it  but I think when you’ve got a 30 minute speech to the nation - effectively, a kind of Australian version on a

State of the Union address - there’s a lot of fine print which you don’t want to read out. It’s a bit like  reading out the Book of Numbers from the pulpit, which might be a little dull but John, look…

JOHN LAWS:

You said you’d stop unnecessary new taxes. That’s a little bit vague. Give me a couple of examples of  unnecessary taxes.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well the carbon tax and the mining tax are two which I would like to stop and the carbon tax is the biggest  change since the GST and it would be just unconscionable, John, for the Government to try to sneak it  through without first getting a mandate for it at an election and this is particularly the case when the Prime  Minister said six days before the last election that ‘there will be no carbon tax under the government I lead’.  Now, we’ve discussed this on air before, I don’t want to go over old ground but I think that that this false  statement of the Prime Minister’s is really going to haunt her to her political grave.

JOHN LAWS:

Yeah well, it probably should because it was an absolute lie. There’s no other word for it.

TONY ABBOTT:

That’s right and I’d been saying it from the start of the campaign, that ‘as sure as night follows day there  will be a carbon tax if this Government’s re-elected’ and it was in response to that that she finally made this  carefully calculated and premeditated statement to try to win votes that otherwise she would have lost and  then she betrayed people.

JOHN LAWS:

Is it reasonable that a country should have to accept a prime minister who betrays them?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I think sometimes, for good reason, politicians might have to change their minds but when they  change their mind on something as important as this they should then seek a new mandate and that’s what  John Howard did in 1998 with the GST. The basic problem here, John, is that the working families that the  Government talked about incessantly in 2007 have become the forgotten families in 2011 and I think this is  why so many people feel completely ripped off by this Government.

JOHN LAWS:

Tell me, what do you define as rich? Where would you cut off things like family tax benefits? What do you  define as rich?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, a couple of observations. First, John, the changes in this budget don’t just affect people over $150,000  a year. People on as little as $45,000 a year start to be impacted by the changes in this budget. Second point  I’d make is that, sure, if I’m a single bloke with no responsibilities and I’m earning $100,000 a year, I’m  doing pretty well. But if I’m a policeman married to a nurse trying to pay a mortgage in Sydney, earning  maybe $150,000 as a family, I’m still doing it incredibly tough and that’s the thing, I mean…

JOHN LAWS:

Well, how would you and the government you led improve their lot? The policeman and the nurse.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, the best thing I could do, if don’t hit them with the great big new taxes, I make it easier for them to  pay their bills and if I cut out the wasteful government spending, I take the pressure off interest rates.

JOHN LAWS:

How would you make it easier for them to pay their bills?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, without a carbon tax, your petrol is not going to be more expensive because of deliberate action of  government and without a carbon tax, your power bill’s not going to be more expensive because of  deliberate action of government.

JOHN LAWS:

You’ve talked about cutting welfare bills, where would you start there?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I think one thing that we really need to do, and this has been put forward by Warren Mundine, the  former national president of the Labor Party and someone for whom I have a lot of respect…

JOHN LAWS:

Yes.

TONY ABBOTT:

…I mean, Warren knows a lot about welfare because he grew up with the indigenous people of Dubbo and  he says that in places where there’s unskilled work readily available and it might not always be great work  but nevertheless it is good work and honourable work, such as working on farms or in abattoirs, in places  where unskilled work is readily available he said that you’ve just got to cut off the dole for people under 30.  Now, I think this is something that the Government should do…

JOHN LAWS:

Well if they cut off, excuse me interrupting but if they cut off the dole, how do those people then survive if  work is not available?

TONY ABBOTT:

Ah yes, but it’s only in places where work, unskilled work, is readily available.

JOHN LAWS:

I see, so, you’re not talking about rural areas?

TONY ABBOTT:

No, I mean, for instance, you often hear this from farmers during the fruit picking season, that they can’t get  people to come out and pick their crop and yet you go and look at the stats in that place and there might be,  in theory, eight per cent unemployment. Now, if there’s a young person on the dole while farmers can’t get  people to pick their crops, I think we’ve got a problem.

JOHN LAWS:

Can you imagine an out of work accountant going out to pick crops?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, if that’s the only work available, it’s not going to be something that he or she would be doing forever  but I think it’s better and I think most people would feel better in themselves…

JOHN LAWS:

Oh, I agree with, believe me, I agree with that absolutely but whether or not it’s going to work at a social  level, you know, is somebody like, an accountant just jumps into mind, or a senior salesman, are they going  to go out there and pick oranges?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, we’re not talking in these cases normally about people under 30, John. But the point I make is that  there is dignity in work, John and sure, I might prefer to be employed as a senior manager in a business or  sure, I might prefer to be employed, you know, doing the job that I last had but if that job is no longer  available but there is a different job available, I think that it’s fair enough for the public to say ‘well, that job  should be done rather than people being on welfare’ and, as I said, whatever the reluctance might be, I think  pretty soon people think, ‘well, at least I have the self-respect and the dignity of work.’

JOHN LAWS:

Yeah. Well, I think most people would certainly agree with that but there’s also the point if somebody has to  take any work that comes along and they don’t want to keep doing that work forever, how are they going to  be able to look for the job they want because they’re still at work?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well that’s a fair point but there are very few jobs that require you to be at work for such long hours that you  can’t also look for work. I mean, you know, if you’ve got a job now and you want a different one, you  normally manage to find opportunities to go job-hunting.

JOHN LAWS:

You’re talking about an early election. I think you’d like one but when would you like it?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I’m saying, John, that it would be unconscionable of the Prime Minister to try to sneak her carbon tax  through this parliament given that 144 out of 150 of this parliament’s lower house members were committed  not to have a carbon tax. Now, for a parliament so constituted…

JOHN LAWS:

Sorry, just, could you just give me those numbers again? 100 and what?

TONY ABBOTT:

144. You see, there are 144 Coalition and Labor members of parliament and the Coalition was ferociously  opposed to a carbon tax and the Labor Party was committed not to introduce a carbon tax by the Prime  Minister. There was 144 members of the parliament went to the people saying no carbon tax. There was one  member, the Green, Adam Bandt, who went to the people saying there will be a carbon tax and I just think  it’s outrageous that one should trump 144.

JOHN LAWS:

It seems ridiculous.

TONY ABBOTT:

I mean, that’s what the Prime Minister’s doing to us.

JOHN LAWS:

Yeah, it does, it seems ridiculous. Listen, what would you be doing about asylum seekers?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well you know, John Howard had policies that worked. It was Nauru, Manus, temporary protection visas  and a willingness to turn boats around where it was safe to do so and I think that the Prime Minister has  already flip-flopped when she said ‘ok, we’ll try to reopen Manus’ and ‘ok, we’ll try to send people to  Malaysia’ which is not a signatory of the UN Convention on Refugees. Well, now that she’s conceded that  all of her so-called arguments of principle against what John Howard did were false arguments. She should  just pick up the phone to the president of Nauru and get the Nauru camp reopened, as well as Manus - which  I don’t think is ever going to happen under this Government - and also introduce temporary protection visas  because if people who come here illegally by boat think that they can get permanent residency, which they  can under this Government, the people smugglers will always have a product to sell.

JOHN LAWS:

Yeah. Are you on a mobile phone?

TONY ABBOTT:

I’m afraid I am, John. I’m travelling back to Sydney by car because Canberra Airport’s closed.

JOHN LAWS:

Oh yeah, with the, because of the fog?

TONY ABBOTT:

That’s correct.

JOHN LAWS:

Yeah.

TONY ABBOTT:

Wasn’t just politicians’ fog this morning.

JOHN LAWS:

The difference between the fog and the politicians is the fog will ultimately lift.

TONY ABBOTT:

Not all politicians are as bad as each other, though!

JOHN LAWS:

Well…

TONY ABBOTT:

There are politicians and politicians, John.

JOHN LAWS:

Well, we should be grateful for small mercies.

TONY ABBOTT:

Absolutely.

JOHN LAWS:

Good to talk to you Tony. Next time, try and do it through a proper telephone for your sake, not mine. I  mean, I can hear you but it doesn’t sound all that good for the listeners, but we’ll put up with it because I  wanted to talk to you but next time let’s see if we can get a solid line?

TONY ABBOTT:

That’s something I’d prefer too, John. Thank you.

JOHN LAWS:

Ok, nice to talk to you, Tony.
