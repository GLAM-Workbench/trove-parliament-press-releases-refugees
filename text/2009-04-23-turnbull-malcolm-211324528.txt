E&OE…………………………………………………………………………………...

PARIS LORD:

Joining us now very kindly from his busy tour of the Top End is the Federal Opposition Leader Malcolm  Turnbull. Good morning.

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Good morning Paris.

PARIS LORD:

Thanks for coming in. We know you’ve got a packed schedule while you’re here.

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Yes, we’ve got a lot to do, a lot of people to meet, a lot of important events to attend. Hyacinth  Tungutalum’s funeral today of course and the Dawn Service on Saturday on Anzac Day.

PARIS LORD:

One of the things overnight, the International Monetary Fund was predicting Australia’s economy is going  to contract about 1.4 per cent this year. This is part of the World Economic Outlook, and forecasting that it  may grow slightly again next year and the IMF also predicts rising unemployment in Australia may increase  to 6.8 per cent this year and just under 8 per cent the following year. What are your thoughts on where this is  all going?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Well, certainly the global economy is deteriorating and unemployment is rising. Growth is slowing around  the world and also, of course, in Australia. We went into this downturn in a better position than most other  developed countries because of the very strong economic state that the previous government, the Howard

Government left Australia in, paying off all of Labor’s debt and ensuring that we had strong surpluses, low  unemployment and strong economic growth.

Mr Rudd inherited a very good set of economic cards. The question is how well is he playing them now. We  believe that he’s borrowing too much money and spending it very unwisely. It’s all to very little effect. He’s  borrowed and spent in the last four months $23 billion for cash splashes which have not created a single job.  They haven’t stopped the slowing of economic growth; they haven’t stopped the rise in unemployment.

We have alternative policies which will involve less debt while better targeted at creating jobs and will  ensure that we weather - if our policies are adopted - we will weather this economic storm in much better  shape than we will under Mr Rudd’s policies.

PARIS LORD:

The Prime Minister was, up until this week, was unable to use the ‘r’ word, the recession word in a sentence  and now it seems to be free reign on that. He’s also said that there’s going to be a third stimulus plan in the  budget coming up and The Australian’s reported today that Wayne Swan’s going to be able to fund billions  of dollars of extra spending because raiding supposedly a ‘hollow log’ created last year. I take it you don’t  approve of the upcoming third stimulus package, another cash splash [inaudible]?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Well it depends what it is. If it’s another cash handout, it will be as ineffective as the last two. Obviously if  you send everybody a cheque for 900 bucks or a thousand dollars or 500 bucks or whatever it is, people will  say ‘thanks very much’ and most people will spend it wisely or more likely actually use it to pay down debt,  so they’ll in effect save it. And there is the problem. You see, what the Government is doing is buying itself  a lot of popularity, sending out a lot of money but it isn’t creating jobs, it isn’t effective.

Now if they were spending that money on building roads or bridges or ports, water schemes, all of that  would create employment and it creates economic activity both now and in the future. You know, I’ve been  going around Australia talking to communities in New South Wales, central Queensland very recently and  people have been saying to me, well, why is Kevin Rudd borrowing all this money and handing it out in  $900 licks and yet he’s not spending money on this railway, this road, this airport, this freeway extension.  They’re pointing to concrete projects that are literally ready to go that are not being invested in and I think  the critical obligation of any government is to make sure that the taxpayer gets value for the dollars the  government spends. So it’s not a question of whether governments should spend money or not.  Governments should spend money wisely and carefully, recognising that it’s other people’s money.

PARIS LORD:

Well from the recession to refugees and asylum seekers, the Navy intercepted a boatload of Sri Lankans, 32  men, yesterday and The Australian has reporting that there’s possibly another boat which has left Indonesia  yesterday and should be soon entering Australian waters. What are your thoughts on what’s going on?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Well I don’t think there’s any doubt about what’s going on. The Rudd Government made a point of  changing the Howard Government’s border protection policies. They made a big point about that, and as  Steve Cook from the International Organization for Migration based in Jakarta said last year, the people  smugglers will now test the envelope. They will now take advantage of this and see if they can have more  success in getting people into Australia than they did under the previous government. And that’s exactly  what they’re doing. The Indonesian Ambassador said much the same thing just the other day.

So the reality is that Mr Rudd’s border protection policies are failing. The proof is in the pudding. As every  boat arrives, as more unfortunate people get into these boats, which are criminal rackets, these people

smugglers are criminals, many of them are tied up in drug trafficking and worse. There’s great concern at  the International Conference on People Smuggling in Bali recently about the links between the people  smugglers and terrorism. This is one of the items that all the nations there present particularly addressed. So  we’re talking about a very evil, dangerous, criminal group of people smugglers and they are ramping up  their operations and the Government’s border protection policies are not working. Mr Rudd has to address  that. What is he going to do to keep our borders protected? What’s he going to do to stop this trade? So far  we’ve seen nothing.

PARIS LORD:

But no country can stop the trade. Italy’s been trying for years; it has tens of thousands of people each year.  Spain has a similar problem. There will always be poor people who are trying to transit to get into richer  countries so you can’t exactly stop it. You can only manage it, can’t you?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Well when you’re faced with a challenge, you can always just throw up your hands and surrender, say I’m  helpless. That seems to be what Mr Rudd is doing, saying there’s nothing he can do about it. Let’s just look  at the facts. People smuggling has been an issue for many, many years, for decades, many decades. There  have been nearly twice as many people arrive unlawfully by boat since August - nearly twice as many in  those few months since August - as in the previous six years. Think about that. This has been a dramatic  increase in unauthorised boat arrivals, Paris. There’s no way you can get around that. That’s the fact. So we  can debate which policy mixture is right or wrong and you can argue about this point or that point. Border  protection policies have to be looked at as a whole. Our policy package as a whole worked. Mr Rudd’s  policy package as a whole has failed. He’s the Prime Minister. What’s he going to do about it? Apparently  he throws up his hands and says oh the Italians have got more people being smuggled into their country than  we have so [inaudible] worry about it. Well that’s not good enough. Australians expect their Prime Minister  and their Government to protect their borders.

PARIS LORD:

On Saturday it’s Anzac Day. One of the reasons you’re here is for Dawn Services, and the Territory  Government’s putting on free buses to Anzac Day Services in Darwin, Palmerston and the northern suburbs.  Also free car park in the city. The car park’s run by Darwin City Council. Where will you be at the Dawn  Service?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Well I’ll be at the Dawn Service there, the same as everybody else with Lucy. My wife Lucy is up here with  me and we’ll both be very pleased to be there, reflecting on the sacrifice that so many Australians have made  in war over many generations and remembering too the sacrifices and the perils that Australian servicemen  and women are facing today.

PARIS LORD:

Will you have a chance to get out to the Adelaide River War Cemetery there, the Commonwealth Graves?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

If we can include that on Saturday, we’ll certainly endeavour to do that.

PARIS LORD:

Now we know that you’re a big fan of the republic and so on. The Territory has a bit of a problem with  statehood in that we’re not a state yet…

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

You had a bit of a problem with a referendum, as I did.

PARIS LORD:

You reckon you could help us become, because it’s been a long struggle for the Territory to achieve  statehood, so you reckon we could bypass becoming a state and just go straight to becoming a Republic of  the Northern Territory?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

What, and secede?

PARIS LORD:

Well not so much secede as stay within the overall Commonwealth but just say, we want statehood, it’s  taken far too long. Let’s just go the next logical step.

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Well look, if you want to be a republic - and I would love Australia to be a republic as everyone knows -  you have to get a referendum passed and I think you face the same challenge with statehood. Ultimately,  these changes are ones that have to be supported by a majority of the population. Changing Australia’s  federal constitution, the Commonwealth Constitution is very hard because you have to get a national  majority and a majority in four out of six states. So that’s why we’ve had very few successful amendments.  But ultimately it’s not a question of, in the Territory’s case, statehood being denied by somebody else. It’s a  question of if the majority of the people want to do something then in the final analysis they will get their  way, as they should in a democracy.

PARIS LORD:

Lastly, we know that the former Leader of the Liberal Party John Howard used to each morning regularly go  for his morning walks in tracksuits and listening to the radio and so on. I understood he used to listen to  Radio National Breakfast a lot. Do you have any sort of similar regime?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Not as regular as John. I normally do exercise in the morning. But it depends on the circumstance, depends  how early I’m starting off - often start doing radio very early in the morning. He was really admirable in the  regularity of his exercise. John Howard’s management, I guess, of his regime, of his exercise regime is an  example that all Australians should aspire to. He really set a great example of physical fitness, of practical  physical fitness which was achievable. There are some people that are super athletes and do things that the  average man and woman can’t aspire to, but I think Howard really set an example that all of us would do  well to emulate more often in terms of his daily exercise.

PARIS LORD:

I asked the question about the tracksuit because I brought along a tape measure and if my producer Zoe  Akkerman can come in and help, we’d like to take your measurements to perhaps get a Territory tracksuit  made up, one with, on the chest would be a Territory flag because, as you’re aware, it doesn’t have any signs  of Britain on it at all.





MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Alright…

PARIS LORD:

Perhaps on the back we could get a big crocodile…

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

You don’t have to measure me up. Just XL will be, XL will be fine.

PARIS LORD:

Okay. We’d appreciate if you do go for morning walks and so on, to be advertising the Territory and  crocodiles. It’d be a big help…

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Okay. Always happy to support you.

PARIS LORD:

Cheers Mr Turnbull. Thanks for dropping by.

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Yeah that’s great Paris.
