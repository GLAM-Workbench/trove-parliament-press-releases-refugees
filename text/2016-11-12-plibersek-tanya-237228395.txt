INTRODUCTION

It’s great to be back in Tasmania. And in Queenstown.

I love coming to Tasmania - both for work and pleasure. It’s a very special part of  the world.

Of course, I was also here many times during the recent federal election campaign.

In particular I spent a lot of time with the extremely hardworking Anne Urquhart,  Carol Brown and Helen Polley - part of Labor’s terrific, 100% female Senate  contingent from Tasmania.

Anne, Carol and Helen as Duty Senators helped lead our charge on the ground in  Bass, Braddon and Lyons to unseat the notorious ‘three amigos’.

With great support from Julie Collins, Catryna Bilyk, Lisa Singh and John Short.

And what a fantastic result!

Three outstanding new Labor Members of the House of Representatives have now  joined us in Canberra -

Justine Keay, Brian Mitchell, and Ross Hart.

Outstanding candidates, supported by excellent campaigns - branch members,  union members, and an unprecedented level of support from ordinary Tasmanians  who wanted to see the back of a nasty Liberal government.

Let’s give our new MPs a big round of applause.

They are already making a significant contribution to the Parliament, and advancing  the interests of their local communities.

I wanted to also pay tribute to our terrific candidate for Denison, Jane Austin. Jane -  you and your team should be incredibly proud of the principled campaign you ran -  with Labor values front and centre.

Putting your hand up to run for office is no easy decision. We thank you for it.

TASMANIAN LABOR HAS A PROUD LEGACY

Tasmania is a better place to live and work, because of people like all of you.

Because of Labor.

Because of our friends in the unions. Our party is nothing without the labour  movement.

Because of Labor -

Tasmania became an education, science and research state - huge investments in  early education through Child and Family Centres and the Launch into Learning, so  young people have the best possible chance in life; investments in the University of  Tasmania, and Antarctic research.

Because of Labor -

Tasmania got a massive infrastructure boost - the Royal Hobart Hospital  redevelopment; the irrigation schemes; the National Broadband Network, the  Brighton bypass; and the Tasmanian freight rail network rebuild.

Because of Labor -

Tasmania was transformed into a tourism powerhouse - supporting festivals like  Dark MOFO, Falls Festival, and 10 Days on the Island; developing the Three Cape  Track; and bringing AFL and test match cricket to the state. And right here on the  West Coast, the wilderness railway was saved and is back operational.

Because of Labor -

Tasmania became a more inclusive, compassionate place to live - the first Lower  House in the country to vote to legalise same sex marriage; the first state to enact a  civil union scheme and recognise overseas marriages; and in 2013 abortion was  removed from the criminal code and terminations became regulated under health  laws.

As I’ve said before, progress such as this doesn’t happen by accident. It is not  inevitable.

Progress is hard won, and we must work hard to protect it.

It takes us and our friends to fight and win this change, and to defend it.

And it takes the genuine progressive party of government - it takes Labor - to  implement it.

Generations of Labor governments have strengthened Tasmania’s economy and  built a fairer society too.

But the Liberals are all about tearing that down.

LIBERALS’ FAILURE

Having Liberal governments at both a state and federal level is a toxic combination.

They sing from the same songsheet.

And make excuses for each others’ cuts and incompetence.

Federal Liberals like Eric Abetz, David Bushby, Richard Colbeck and Eric Abetz’s  latest export to Canberra - his protÃÂ©gÃÂ© Jonathan Duniam.

Saying nothing as Malcolm Turnbull rips the guts out of services the people of  Tasmania rely on - health, education, infrastructure.

Saying nothing while this region is receiving a second rate fibre to the premises  NBN.

And cheering on Will Hodgman as he does the same at the state level.

The Abbott-Turnbull cuts are bad for all Australians, but they hit Tasmania  particularly hard.

$60 million cut from Tasmanian schools, and $125 million cut from the Tasmanian  university sector.

$1.2 billion ripped out of Tasmanian hospitals.

Funding cut from employment programs, such as Youth Connections, that worked to  get people into jobs, while youth unemployment in some parts of Tasmania is around  20 per cent.

Funding has been cut from rural health outreach programs that have dire  consequences for regional communities like the West Coast.

And the Liberals were arguing for tax cuts big business and millionaires, when nearly  nine in ten Tasmanians got not tax cut at all.

Malcolm Turnbull and the Liberals have their priorities all wrong.

THE HUMAN FACE OF THE LIBERALS’ FAILURE

Sometimes, it’s easy to get caught up in the numbers.

The scale of the Liberals’ cuts means they can sometimes be hard to fathom.

But on the receiving end of every single one of Malcolm Turnbull’s cuts is an ordinary  person - a pensioner, a student, a child, a family whose life just got a whole lot  tougher.

Like Alexandra from Devonport, who I met with Justine Keay -

Alexandra was a single Mum with a two year old, who worked in retail. She wanted  to study at TAFE, but couldn’t afford it because of the Liberals’ cuts.

Or Justine from Longford, who I met with Brian Mitchell -

Justine had suffered rheumatoid arthritis nearly all her life. She told us she would be  forced to skip doctors’ appointments and cut back on medicine because of the  Liberals plans to jack up fees.

Or the more than 20 communities in Tasmania, some represented by Ross Hart, that  still have unsafe drinking water.

While the Liberals sat and did nothing, Labor committed $75 million of new water  infrastructure for Tasmania - Ross and I made that announcement in Launceston.

Or Kelly-Ann from Hobart, who I met with the terrific Julie Collins, Carol Brown,  Catryna Bilyk, and Lisa Singh.

While the Liberals were giving tax cuts to big business, Kelly-Ann was worse off.

She said to us:

“I live [on] under $30,000 a year, and pay a mortgage, am a mother of two and  working part-time.

And [the Liberals’] cuts really dig deep for me because I rely on childcare to be able  to go to work to maintain a household.

I rely on the Government's health services and I've been using the dental service for  my child and the fact that they're going to be cutting preventative measures for  women is a really big issue for me as well.

We've already got a really, really tight budget...I'd just like to have a fair go…

I want my children to be able to grow up and not worry about $100,000 education  fees and $4 internships.

I want them to be able to grow in this state and stay in this state and have a  wonderful education…that's what's important to me.”

A TALE OF TWO TASMANIAS

These stories serve to highlight the clear task for any good government.

That is, what is the best plan for good jobs with a future. And the best plan to reduce  inequality, and increase opportunity.

Inequality in Australia is at 75 year highs. The three richest Australians have more  wealth than the million poorest.

And in the recent decades, it’s been getting worse. (Except during the Rudd and  Gillard Governments).

You see a similar pattern in the United States.

In 1985 the Australian minimum wage was $5.66 AUD an hour - in 2015 it had risen  to $17.29 - an increase of 11.2 per cent in real terms.

In the USA the 1985 minimum wage was $3.35 USD an hour - and in 2015 it was  $7.25 - a decrease in real terms of 21 per cent.

Australia’s middle class holds 40 per cent of our national wealth - the American  middle class, just 19 per cent.

I think that economic reality played a part in the result we’ve just seen in the US  election.

We must learn important lessons from the US experience.

As I’ve said before, economic insecurity gives people the feeling that the system is  stacked against them, or is broken altogether.

There is a strong sense that the rich are getting richer while they ordinary families  continue to struggle.

People are worried about insecure work, stagnant wages growth, uncertainty about  where the jobs of the future will come from.

People who believe they have been failed by their governments become open to  political figures who just reflect back their fears, claiming to have easy answers.

As a responsible party of government, Labor can’t pretend the answers are easy.

We must genuinely listen to and engage with the fears and insecurities of our  citizens - like:

Does the industry I’m working in have a future, or will it be driven out of Australia like  the car industry was?

Will I be ‘downsized’?

Where will my next job come from? Will it have decent pay and conditions?

Where is the apprenticeship for my son or daughter? What kind of work will they  have?

Will I ever be able to afford a home of my own?

How can we afford childcare fees or a university education?

What happens if I get sick or injured?

These are some of questions being asked by people right here in Queenstown too.

A close-knit, hardworking community. A community facing the challenges of  transition.

It’s places such as Queenstown that suffer most from the Liberals’ cuts to education,  health, infrastructure, and Malcolm Turnbull’s stuffed up NBN.

But it’s places such as Queenstown that will benefit most from Labor’s positive plans  for investment in jobs, education, health, and infrastructure like the NBN.

It really is a tale of two Tasmanias.

A Tasmania under the Liberals that rips apart the building blocks of prosperity.

Or a Tasmania under Labor where we encourage economic growth with investment  in education, health, and infrastructure that generates high quality, well paid jobs.

It’s a clear choice.

Sadly, the Liberals choose big business and high income earners over ordinary  Australians, ordinary Tasmanians, every time.

THE TURNBULL LIBERALS - A GOVERNMENT IN CRISIS

Not only are the Liberals making the wrong choices, they a running a chaotic  shambles of a government.

The Turnbull Government is in crisis.

A crisis of both competence, and integrity.

Malcolm Turnbull has completely lost control of his party, and is simply unable to  govern.

Just this week -

Malcolm Turnbull is embroiled in a scandal centred on former Senator Bob Day.

Where it’s been revealed the Liberals knew that Mr Day’s election was potentially  invalid long before they told anyone.

The Government introduced ridiculous, unfair law on asylum seekers - which I’m  proud to say Labor decided, unanimously, to oppose.

Malcom Turnbull caved into the extreme right of his own party by looking at plans to  weaken our race discrimination legislation.

It seems introducing ridiculous asylum seekers laws, and making it easier to be  racist are Malcolm Turnbull’s highest priorities.

That just shows how out of touch the Liberals are.

They are focussing on that nonsense when 100,000 full time jobs have been lost this  year.

And when they’ve octupled the deficit [$4.7 billion for the 2015-16 year has blown out  eight-fold to $40 billion].

And of course in the last little while we’ve also seen -

Tony Abbott and Malcolm Turnbull at war again.

Malcolm Turnbull implicated in a dirty guns for votes deal.

The Attorney-General, George Brandis, at war with the Solicitor-General, causing the  wrong man to resign.

The Turnbull Government become the first majority Government in more than 50  years to lose control of the House of Representatives.

The Liberals let the Senate run out of legislation to debate.

The Treasurer, Scott Morrison, introduce legislation containing a $107 million black  hole.

The Foreign Minister, Julie Bishop, spent more than $200,000 sending 23 public  servants to Paris to talk to each other about how to save money.

And, of course, Malcolm Turnbull arguing to spend $200 million on an unnecessary,  divisive, plebiscite on a marriage equality, that he doesn’t believe in and his MPs  have said they’ll ignore anyway.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢           I am very pleased that earlier this week, Labor led the charge to block the  plebiscite in the Senate.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢           LGBTI people, rainbow families, are incredibly relieved.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢           But, of course, this is not where the fight for marriage equality ends.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢           We can have marriage equality by Christmas, if only Mr Turnbull was strong  enough to stand up for the principles he supposedly believes in.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢           Malcolm Turnbull is now the only thing standing in the way of marriage  equality in Australia.

CONCLUSION

You see the chaos and cuts of Will Hodgman and the Liberals here in Tasmania.

You see Malcolm Turnbull with such contempt for this state, he can’t make room for  even one of his Tasmanian colleagues in his ministry.

I’ve been a regular visitor to Tasmania.

And I make a promise here today.

I will be back here, time and time again, over the coming years.

To keep making the case that’s it only Labor’s positive policies that will give the  people of Tasmania the opportunity of good jobs with a future, and to build the best  lives for themselves, and their families, in this beautiful state you are all so lucky to  call home.
