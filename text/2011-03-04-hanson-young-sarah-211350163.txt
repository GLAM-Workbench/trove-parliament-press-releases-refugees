MEDIA RELEASE

Government Gets It Wrong Again On Refugees  - Greens

News that the Government is expanding immigration detention centres is  disappointing and further evidence that it does not understand how to deal with  asylum seeker policy, according to the Australian Greens.

“Rather than abandoning the failed policy of mandatory detention, the Government is  instead building more facilities to house innocent asylum seekers,” said the Greens’  Immigration Spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young.



“Shamefully 400 of these new places will be to keep children and their families  locked up. With 900 genuine refugees continuing to languish in detention while they  wait for ASIO security assessment, the Government needs to be doing more to move  these people through the system quickly.”

“Throwing more money at detention centres is doing nothing to relieve the pressure  in the system, rather it is compounding the suffering of vulnerable asylum seekers  who have come to our country seeking our protection.”

“Sadly the Government’s ‘tough but humane’ immigration policy rings hollow once  again,” Senator Hanson-Young said.
