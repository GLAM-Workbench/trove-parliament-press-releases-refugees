TRANSCRIPT OF THE LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION  THE HON JOHN HOWARD MP  DOORSTOP INTERVIEW - FREIGHT CONGRESS ’95  WORLD CONGRESS CENTRE, MELBOURNE

Topics: Barry Jones; East-West runway; Defence

E&OE................................................................................................................................................

HOW ARD:

Well, I'd just like to open up by saying that Barry Jones has done it again. The national  president o f the ALP has given us a  very clear idea o f what the choice is in the next  election campaign. He wants higher taxation.

I mean, the Prime Minister said the other day that this was going to be a campaign on  ideas. The first idea you've had from the Labor Party is higher taxation. I'd have to  say that the last thing small business, and the last thing workers and battlers want in  Australia at the present time is an increase in taxation, and yet that is the prescription  that has been laid out by the national president o f the Australian Labor Party, the

acknowledged ideas man o f the Australian Labor Party and it represents a very clear  choice between the Coalition and the Labor Party.

The first idea they trot out is an idea which is anathema to small business, with the  anti-employment, anti-small business and clearly against the interests o f Australian  workers.

JOU RN A LIST:

M r Howard, you've detailed some o f your IR changes. Can you confirm that there will  be more than four minimum standards or not?

HOW ARD:

I can confirm that there will be a more detailed policy released at the appropriate time  but the elements are what I laid out this morning, and fm  not adding any more at this  stage.

JOU RN A LIST:

Why is that?

HOW ARD;

Because Pm choosing not to.

JOURNALIST:

Wouldn't small business like to know what....

HOW ARD:

I think small business is very happy indeed with the approach we've got. The thing  that they are most immediately worried about is this ludicrous unfair dismissal law  which actually frightens them out o f taking on staff and is actually working against  lowering unemployment.

JOURNALIST:

Could you just clarify it again this morning though - amid continuing criticism and the  scare campaign from the Government, isn't it the case that you'll keep copping this  scare campaign until you do release the ...

HOW ARD:

I think the reality is that no matter what I say the Prime Minister will tell lies about it.

JOU RN A LIST:

M r Howard some Sydney local councils have threatened legal action if the East-West  runway is reopened. Are you still sticking by your commitment?

HOW ARD:

I am absolutely committed to the re-opening o f the East-West runway and over the  past two or three days the evidence is rapidly accumulating on my side. You've had  the pilots resisting pressure from QANTAS to come out against the opening o f the  East-West runway. The pilots know more about safety, in my view, than anybody else.  They have to put their lives on the line every day. They agree with me.

We had the Government's own safety adviser in 1990 introducing evidence that the  preference for parallel runway operation is in fact more dangerous - not safer - but  more dangerous, than the proposal that I have put forward, and I make it clear that I  remain rock solid in my commitment to re-opening the East-West runway.

06-OCT-1995 10=50 FROM TO 062772055 P.04

I will support the privatisation o f Kingsford-Smith airport on condition that the noise  problem is first addressed and that must include the re-opening o f  the East-West  runway. There has been no change. There will be no change. I am absolutely  committed to that.

JOURNALIST:

You're not concerned about putting local councils off side?

HOW ARD:

Well, I am concerned about protecting people, and at the moment there are hundreds  o f thousands o f people in Sydney who are being very very unfairly treated and it has  always been an Australian view that if we've got a bit o f a problem, then if you fairly  share the burden it is an easier thing to  cope with.

At the moment, a small number o f people are getting it in the neck as the result o f a  sleazy political decision made by Laurie Brereton and Paul Keating.

JOU RN A LIST:

Mr Howard, a lot was made o f your brief exchange with Paul Keating yesterday. Are  you in fact mates outside o f the political ring?

HOW ARD:

Oh, my quarrel with my Labor opponent is a political one. He’s just been a very bad  Prime Minister and the country needs better and deserves better and I intend to offer it  over the weeks and months ahead, and it's for the Australian people at the end o f that  process to make a decision, but I am a bloke who keeps his eye on issues and the

political divide rather than anything else.

JOU RN A LIST:

M r Howard, on defence, how are you going to increase Australia's combat capability if  you don't put more money into it?

HOW ARD:

Well, you shift resources from other areas into it. And this idea, implicit in the Prime  Minister's response that we have to uncritically accept that every dollar o f the $9  billion which is now spent on defence in this country is wisely directed is typical o f his  arrogance.

I mean, the starting point with Paul Keating is always that what he's done is right and  anybody who questions it is somehow or other detached from reality.

JOURNALIST:

So you're not just hampering defence?

HOW ARD:

I'm advancing an intelligent alternative approach that will draw a lot o f support from  the defence community. It's a recognition o f  economic reality but it is also a  recognition that there has been an inappropriate balancing o f our commitment in the  defence area and we also have this problem that you really have three segments o f the  army now. You have the regulars, you have the Ready Reserve and you have the  ordinary Reserve and the tensions, particularly resource allocation tensions that have  developed as a consequence o f that, are having a negative effect on morale in all three  sections o f the Services.
