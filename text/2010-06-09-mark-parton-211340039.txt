TRANSCRIPT OF SENATOR GARY HUMPHRIES  INTERVIEW WITH MARK PARTON,  RADIO 2CC CANBERRA

E&OE…………………………………………………………………

Issues: Border Protection; Tony Abbott

MARK PARTON:

Senator Gary Humphries, Liberal ACT, did you watch that report last night?

GARY HUMPHRIES:

No I didn’t Mark, but I’ve heard about it, and it’s a bit chilling to think people are watching  the situation here and making decisions about people smuggling operations based on political  developments in Australia.

MARK PARTON:

It is a bit of a worry, we chatted with Ray Hadley before 8 and he made mention of a number  of large boats that we know are out there somewhere and heading towards Australia, but we  don’t know exactly when.  And he made the call that the Prime Minister should call that  election quick smart so that he can get it out of the way before they arrive.

GARY HUMPHRIES:

Well that would be nice, but I think the timing of arrivals is very unlikely to change any time  soon.  They’re pouring in at a huge rate, 5 in the last 5 days have arrived.  There have been  more boat arrivals, more people arrive by boat in the first 5 months of this year than arrived  in the entire 13 years following the end of the Vietnam War, when of course we had lots of  people arrive by boat from Vietnam.

MARK PARTON:

Would you be forecasting that this issue again is going to take out massive prominence in the  lead-up to the election?  I mean the Super Profits Tax is dominating things at the moment.

GARY HUMPHRIES:

Yes, I think it will emerge again as an issue of great concern to Australians, and is likely to  polarise a lot of voters.  I think people are concerned that we’re just not getting the message  across to those people who are operating people smuggling operations in Indonesia and

elsewhere.  That in fact the industry seems to have been boosted by the announcement that  they’re not processing any Afghan or Sri Lankan asylum seekers and every indication is that  the policy just isn’t working.  And even in the Government’s own terms you’d have to say  it’s not working.  Over 420 children in detention at the moment in Australia - this is a  Government which campaigned in opposition against having children in detention, but there  are now ten times as many children in detention from when the Coalition left office.

MARK PARTON:

And this is the great problem, if you put a light above the country and it says vacancy, well in  they come.

GARY HUMPHRIES:

Indeed, and the Government’s got to accept that its policies in the present arrangement are  not working, it has to rethink this approach, it has got to get tough.  Every person who arrives  by boat takes away the chance for another refugee to be resettled in Australia under a  humanitarian program, and even the Government’s admitted that over the next twelve months  they expect the number of genuine refugees among those arriving by boat to fall dramatically.   So we’re operating a very expensive system for people that even the Government says for the  most part are not going to be genuine refugees.

MARK PARTON:

Gary we were chatting earlier with Peter Van Onselen from The Australian about some  bigger picture items.  And we were talking about this fascinating election year, because it’s  game on at the moment.  The point that I wanted to bring up was now that Tony Abbott has  done the bullocking work, the hard work that was required to get the Coalition to within  striking distance of the ALP, that now ironically we’re probably in a situation where with  Malcolm Turnbull leading the party you’d probably have a greater chance of winning the  election.

GARY HUMPHRIES:

[laughter] Well that’s sort of pie in the sky speculation…

MARK PARTON:

Well it is!  But I think it’s on the money Gary.  Because so many of these people that are  leaving the Rudd train are over to the left, and although they may say ‘I won’t vote for the  Government, I’ll vote Green’, the preferences are going to go to the Government anyway,  and they’re not going to vote for Tony Abbott.

GARY HUMPHRIES:

Look, I think that remains to be seen, can I say that many elections have demonstrated that  the critical factor is the position of the party and the way in which the people see the parties.   And their record, and their potential to solve Australia’s problems.

MARK PARTON:



Tony Abbott is a polarising leader though, isn’t he Gary.

GARY HUMPHRIES:

I would have thought that the most polarising leader in Australian politics is Kevin Rudd, and  he’s polarising people away from him and away from his Government.  Even 6 months ago  Kevin Rudd was an asset to the Labor Party, today he’s almost certainly a liability.

MARK PARTON:

Would Kim Beazley have made a better Prime Minister?

GARY HUMPHRIES:

Than Kevin Rudd?  He would, yes.  He most certainly would.  I think he would have brought  more maturity and stability to the Government than the zig-zagging we’ve seen from this  Prime Minister.  And I think that’s an important factor.  Experience in Government counts for  quite a lot, and I think we’re seeing the fruits of the fact that not just the Prime Minister but  the overall majority of the Ministers in this Government have had no previous experience in  Government before they took their ministries, and I think some of that is showing.

MARK PARTON:

But back to the original point, would Malcolm Turnbull be more of a chance of winning the  Prime Ministership now than Tony Abbott?

GARY HUMPHRIES:

I don’t think we would be - and I say this as a person who did support Malcolm Turnbull at  the leadership challenge last year - I don’t think we would be in the position of being poised  to take the challenge over Labor if we hadn’t had Tony Abbott in the chair.



MARK PARTON:

You’re absolutely right, but now that we’re at that point, but as of today, if there wasn’t blood  spilt and if it was done, I think Malcolm would have a better chance of winning the big game  now.

GARY HUMPHRIES:

Well look, we’re really speculating about a hypothesis that nobody can prove.  I mean  clearly, where we are today, the position we are in today is the gift of Tony Abbott and his  work in the last 6 months to the Liberal Party.  I think he is clearly the best person who is  placed to dislodge Kevin Rudd from his perch as Prime Minister and that’s what the Liberal  Party will be focusing on in the next 3 months, whatever it is until the election is called.

MARK PARTON:

Thanks for your time this morning Gary.
