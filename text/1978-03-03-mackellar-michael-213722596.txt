STATEMENT BY THE MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND  ETHNIC AFFAIRS, THE HON. M.J.R. MACKELLAR, MP

The Government has a strong record of support for migration and '

migrants, said the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs,  the

Hon. M.J.R. MacKellar, in the House of Representatives on 1 March", in 'a

^debate on migrant services. .  ‘

Mr MacKellar said that it was a fact that unemployment among

overseas-born, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, had been

declining. The decline had been in both numerical and percentage terms. Ã¢ÂÂ   ' Â·  -Â· ... .

The May 1977 labor force survey showed that 89,100 overseas-born

people, or 5-5 per cent, were unemployed. "

The August 1977 survey showed that 86,800, or 5.4 per.cent, were

unemployed.

In November 1977 the survey showed a decline to 83,8 00, or 5.2 per

cent, of the overseas-born work force being unemployed. That was. in-a

period when the migrant intake had increased and the numbers of refugees

arriving in Australia had increased significantly.

Mr MacKellar said he believed that the figures were a tribute to

the resourcefulness of migrants in finding and keeping work. .

Naturally there was a higher unemployment rate among those people

who had arrived recently, of whom a fair proportion were refugees.  One

would expect that refugees might have difficulty in settling into a new

environment and in finding work in that new environment.

He believed that the figures showed that after a time refugees

were finding work and were settling well into the Australian community.

Mr MacKellar said that under the Labor Government immigration "

declined in 1975-76 to 52,000 people, the lowest since 1947. Since that

time the intake had been increased to just over 70,000 people.

A Â­ It should be kept in mind-that the gross migrant intake was a

very different figure from the net increase due to migration because

every year a significant number of people left Australia on a long term

basis or permanently.

Mr MacKellar said that the present Government's support for

migration had been demonstrated^ at the earliest opportunity by the

re-establishment of the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs

which had been abolished by the Labor Government. The Department had

been expanded to include ethnic affairs and subsequently other services

- settlement services, telephone interpreter services, adult education

services - had been added. .  v '  '

He said the Government had taken the initiative in developing

the role of the ethnic media in informing non-English speaking migrants

of the services which were available.

Advertisements setting out in some detail the services available

to migrants and advice on how to contact the relevant government

departments, were being placed in 57 ethnic newspapers throughout Australia

at an estimated cost of $79,000 in a program which began last November

and will conclude this month.

The Government had financed migrant resource centres in Melbourne

and Sydney, representing a marked initiative in the provision of additional

services to migrants, individually and in organisations. The centres

provided a contact and reference point with which people could develop some

affinity and to which they could go for assistance and information.

Mr MacKellar said that the Government had not cut funds available

for migrant education. The amounts spent on migrant adult and child

education under the last Hayden Budget of 1975/76 were $8,231,313 for the

adult program and $21,814,753 on the child program - a total of $30,235,066.

In 1977/78 the amount for the adult program was raised to $11,878,000

which was the largest amount ever spent in Australia on adult migrant

education, and the amount for the child program was raised to $26,005,500,

again the largest ever provided, showing a total of $37,883,500. .

Rather than decreasing the amount of money available, the Government

had in fact significantly increased the expenditure on migrant education, he

added.
