TRANSCRIPT OF NEWS CONFERENCE, PARLIAMENT HOUSE - 8 MAY 1991

E & ÃÂ E - PROOF ONLY

JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, on what description of propriety can  Mr Burke, or impropriety rather, can Mr Burke continue to  remain as Ambassador?

PM: Well, as you know, throughout this whole episode the  relevant Minister, Senator Evans, has acted on the advice of  his Department and that advice, which is still current,  is  that while some of the actions of Mr Burke which have

emerged in the process of the Royal Commission, come into  the category of description that I used in the Parliament  yesterday, it is still their advice that there is nothing  which would require his sacking. It is the case that some  of the things would have warranted a reprimand and a cease  and desist order, as I put it. It's on that basis that the  arrangements that have been made will stand.

JOURNALIST: In that case, don't you think that the  Department is taking an extraordinarily liberal view of  what's acceptable for an Ambassador's behaviour?

PM: Well, let me make the first point Michelle, that I believe totally in the integrity of the Department. I  believe that they are acting according to the rules and the  standards which would normally apply. I mean the only basis

upon which you can have any specific criticisms, you could  attempt to mount any specific criticism of the Department,  would carry some implication that they are acting other than  in accordance with what would be their normal standards.

Senator Evans has no reason to believe that they are, nor do  I.

JOURNALIST: But aren't you tolerating a lot of behaviour that most people would think would be unacceptable in an  Ambassador?

PM: What we've said is that, as I said in the answer to the Parliament yesterday, that they are having a further look to  see if there are some review of the rules that should apply  in the case of Ambassadors.  But I repeat, I have no reason  to believe, and I don't think anyone who knows the standards  and the quality of that Department,  would have any basis for  believing that they have acted other than in a way that they

should.

JOURNALIST: Are there any circumstances in which you would  change your view?

PM: Well, if anything were to emerge in the period that remains while Mr Burke is the Ambassador that was  established, not by way of allegation but there was a  finding of illegality for instance, then obviously in that  category his tenure could not remain. Or if anything was

established rather than by way of innuendo or allegation  that the Department found was not consistent with the  standards which they have been applying, well then obviously  in that case.  The difficulty we have is that this case has  been so coloured by allegations and innuendo which now are  mixed up with concessions of conduct on the part of Mr Burke  which I ’ve labelled as extremely unwise and in some cases

improper,  but they have not come into the category, as I  say, of either illegality or breaching those standards which  the Department have applied in advising their Minister. And  I repeat the advice currently from the Department is that  the advice they've given some days ago still remains valid  as far as the advice they would give to the Minister.

JOURNALIST: In the kind of situation you've described Prime  Minister, are you going to take back the $28,000 present you  decided to give Mr Burke?

PM: I repudiate the proposition of a $28,000 present. You are sufficiently well-informed Laurie, to know that it's an  improper use of language. It was an arrangement that was  made on the initiative of the Department. If you want to  describe the initiative of the Department as a present and

thereby impugn the integrity of the public servants  involved, that is your right to do so. I repudiate it.

JOURNALIST: Did those concessions from Mr Burke come as a  shock or a surprise to you?

PM: Which concessions are you referring to?

JOURNALIST: The ones in the Royal Commission in regard, for example,  to the stamp collection and things like that.

PM: Yes indeed.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, you didn't answer my question, would you take back this money ... would you describe it in  the situation you ...?

PM: Well now that you -JOURNALIST: This ex-gratia payment.

PM: Well alright, if you put it that way correctly, obviously in those circumstances that would have to be  reviewed.

JOURNALIST: The legalities of this question aside, do you acknowledge that this is a political problem for you? As

3

long as Mr Burke stays around until July you will continue  to be asked questions about this.

PM: Yes, that doesn't come as a profound surprise to me.

JOURNALIST: Is that not a political problem?

PM:  That doesn't come as - I mean you're not,  are you telling me that I've got a problem in regard to Burke? Thank you very much. Profound finding.

JOURNALIST: You're asking Mr Burke to continue to represent  Australia abroad where the Senate has passed a motion of no  confidence in him and his own Prime Minister has made  comments critical of him. How tenable is his position?

PM: Well, what the arrangements are of course is that he is  going to be remaining here in Australia for some time to  conduct his affairs as far as they concern the Commission,  and any further preparation he has to do for that. And his

return to both Ireland and the Holy See will be very brief  for the purposes of winding up his affairs there and saying  his farewells.  So there is only a brief period involved and  for specific purposes.

JOURNALIST:  You don't have to rely solely on the Department's advice on this issue, surely?

PM: You don't have to rely solely on the Department's advice but I would suggest that it is appropriate that the  Minister concerned should seek in matters like this to  ensure that he gets advice. I mean in a matter like this I  think Senator Evans has been entirely circumspect. He has

sought to see what is the advice that would come from the  Department on the basis of what they regard as the  appropriate rules and practices. I mean you're in the

situation where there has been a baying for the blood of  Burke from the time of innuendo and allegations and then his  appearance.  I would have thought that in those sort of

circumstances the fairly sensible thing for a Minister to do  to distance himself, as it were, and say, well, what is the  advice that you as the Department give me? Now, having said  that, obviously the Minister has looked at these things.  He's discussed them with me. Our judgement has been that  the advice coming from the Department, and I repeat, I don't  believe anyone has any basis for questioning the integrity  of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. It's been  our judgement that it is appropriate to accept that advice.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, the advice from the Department  is that he behaved improperly. Isn't it then a political  decision for you to make as to whether that is appropriate -PM: I mean you can't take, what you want to do is take half

their advice and not the other half. I mean what they have  said, they have used the phrase 'improper', but it is not  behaviour which calls for a dismissal. Now you want to take  half their advice and not the other half.

JOURNALIST: ... is it Prime Minister, that Ambassadors can behave improperly without being stood down? I mean surely  it's a crazy situation.

PM: You may regard it as crazy. What has happened as a result of these procedures is that there is going to be a  review of the standards, the criteria that are applied.

JOURNALIST: ... standards aren't good enough. I mean why  should our ...

PM: It is being reviewed to see whether in the light of what's happened there is a need to apply a different set of  criteria to Ambassadors beyond what's involved in those  which are currently applying. Now that seems reasonable.

JOURNALIST: That's implying some difference then with the  Department's conclusion, surely?

PM: No, it's implying - and on the part of the Department -I mean it seems to me reasonable that in the circumstances  that have arisen here you would need to have a look to see  whether you need a review to take account of what's  happened.  Now I 'm simply saying that in the circumstances

it is not inappropriate, in my judgement, to accept the  advice that in regard to the principles that have been  applied to this point that there has not been a reason to  dismiss the Ambassador. Now I must say that in the  circumstances where he has tendered his resignation - and  that was an action initiated by him - that curtails this  issue. I mean it's going to - he ceases to be Ambassador in  a relatively short period. He's going back there to say his

farewells, to close his business, to wind up his domestic  affairs as they exist there. In that circumstance it seems  a reasonable thing to review the circumstances and to see  whether there needs to be a more specific set of rules or  procedures laid down.

JOURNALIST: But don't you just set new standards Mr Hawke, isn't it self-evident that this isn't good enough? Do you  need a review?

PM: Well, I'm simply saying that in regard to the future it may be wise to set down, not just simply saying oh, this is  not good enough. I mean obviously if you're going to have a  position where in the future you're going to be able to make

judgements about the actions and the behaviour of  Ambassadors, it would make sense, it seems to me, to set  that out in considerable detail.

JOURNALIST: Could you just tell us whether as a general rule, you think that Ambassadors who are guilty of improper  behaviour should be stood down immediately.

PM: I would think it would depend upon the improper behaviour involved. I mean that's why precisely I think it  makes sense to have a more detailed review. I mean if you

5

simply say improper behaviour, what have you said? I mean,  what may be regarded as improper by you may be different  from what is regarded as improper by someone else in this  room. That's precisely why I've given the answer I have.

It makes sense to try and give some filling out of the sorts  of considerations that you would regard as rendering an  Ambassador no longer fit to hold the post. I mean how can  you possibly say that once you've uttered the word improper  you have fleshed out, in any acceptable form for the future,

criteria by which you would make decisions.

JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, what about not paying tax on investment income which everyone, apart from the ALP,  appears to have to do?

PM: The ALP only? I mean you are -JOURNALIST: Well most people who don't pay tax on investment income end up in trouble with Trevor Boucher.

PM: I mean you are assuming that you would put aside the suggestions that have been made in regard to what happened  in NSW with the Liberal Party under Mr Greiner before the  other State election. Why do you simply say the ALP, when  there is evidence obviously available that this could have  happened elsewhere? Why do you pick out the ALP alone?

JOURNALIST: Mr Greiner is not an Ambassador, Prime  Minister.

PM: No, he's only a Premier.

JOURNALIST: We're talking about definitions of impropriety  Sir. Is that not improper?

PM: I'm simply saying that that matter has arisen and obviously this is a matter for the Tax Office. It would be  a question that the Tax Office would take in this matter as  to whether there was, take into account on these matters I  would think, and I don't undertake the Tax Office's work.

But they would, I imagine, take into account whether there  was intention, knowledge, whether there was an intention to  break the law. It may well be that a decision would be made  that this was simply something that was not thought of. I

don't know, and I'm not seeking to pre-empt what their  decision would be. But I would say that in the whole area  of what happens in tax, decisions are made by the Tax Office  which take into account the intention of the person in  question, and you know that. I don't know what their  decision will be. I simply do not.

JOURNALIST: Senator Evans told the Senate Estimates Committee, as I recall, that on the day that - as a result  of what Mr Burke told various newspapers on the weekend  before he resigned, that if Mr Burke hadn't resigned on that  Monday morning then he would have acted to ... Now, Mr  Burke's own evidence to the Commission since then has raised

far more serious issues. Surely therefore the basis is

6

there for the Government to take the decision that Senator  Evans said he was ready to take on the day that Mr Burke  resigned.

PM: All I can say is that Senator Evans, in my opinion, wisely in this matter, has taken two separate sets of  considerations into account. He has taken into account the  question of facts and he's taken into account, he's sought

to take into account also the question of whether the  circumstances attaching to Mr Burke and what has emerged,   have made it impossible for him to discharge, in a literal  sense with the time that's required,  the duties of that  position. Now all I can say to you is that obviously I have  been in, I've had a number of discussions with Senator

Evans. And his position is still that in terms of what has  emerged beyond allegation and now in terms of concession,  on the advice of the Department,  which is still as of today  current,  that there is nothing in terms of fact which would

lead the Department to advise him and therefore him to take  a different position on the facts.  As to the question of  his capacity to do the job, now that has been finalised by  the decision of Mr Burke to tender his resignation. But  that, I mean I can assure you Geoff, that is the position of

the Minister in his discussions with me.

JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke,  would it not be better for all parties involved ... the process and Australia's  international reputation if Mr Burke was to bring forward  his resignation now in view of his testimony before the  Commission?

PM: Well by some, you know, criteria you might say better but we have - we are not in a position where the Department  has come to the view - at least in the advice that's been  given - that the damage that you suggest to Australia's  reputation has reached a point or is of such magnitude that

that action is required. I mean I go back to what I've  said. The advice that we have is of the kind that I put to  you that the action that the Government has taken is  appropriate.  Now obviously if the assessment were to be  made by the Department differently to what we've got now and  that we were so damaged, I assume that they would give that

advice. We haven't got that advice to this point.

JOURNALIST: But Mr Hawke,  what is your view? Would you ask him to bring it forward? Your own view.

PM: I accept the position as it is. I accept the position as it is.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, when the Fraser Government was in office and you'd discovered that Bob Cotton or Vic  Garland or John Macleay were operating secret funds to help  the Liberal Party, that you say the Labor Party would not  regard that as a sackable offence?

PM: I guess that if we were in Opposition there would've  been a view in Opposition that you should attack the

7

Government.  I mean that would be nothing new. I mean that  is the nature of politics, isn't it? You would have to ask  the corresponding question, would the now Opposition, if  they were in Government,  would they adopt a different  position to one they are adopting? Or would they perhaps

adopt the position they adopted where they had a Royal  Commission into one of their own Ministers? They  established the Royal Commission, the Royal Commission came  down with a finding in regard to Nixon which by any  definitions required the sacking of the Minister. What was

the reaction of the Opposition parties in Government then?  To abuse the Royal Commissioner. So ask the question both  ways.

JOURNALIST: Just on that point Prime Minister, there was another Royal Commission and when Malcolm Fraser was told  that Senator Withers had acted improperly, he sacked him.  As far as this issues is concerned, is this your personal

judgement to decide the question of propriety or not or is  it in the Department of Foreign Affairs that you primarily  look for guidance?

PM: It is the decision made by the Minister which is discussed with me and it's a decision which is based upon  the advice from the Department.

JOURNALIST: Do you accept personal responsibility for this judgement?

PM: Which judgement? The judgement made by the Department?

JOURNALIST: No, the judgement which you're making now -PM: Obviously we, as a Government and I as Prime Minister,  have to accept the final responsibility. I mean you know  what the nature of the Westminster system and the  responsible system of government is. You have advice -JOURNALIST: It was just difficult to tell.

PM: I don't think it was. If you read the transcript it's not difficult at all. Not difficult at all. You may want  to put your interpretation on it. That's your right. But  if you read what I've said I don't think it's difficult to

tell at all.

JOURNALIST:  Mr Hawke, when the arrangements were being made for Mr Burke's Romanian trip with Mr Hancock's staff, did  you have any knowledge whatsoever that Mr Hancock was a  substantial donor to the WA ALP?

PM:  No, no.

JOURNALIST: None whatsoever?

PM: No. I mean I just simply do - I have no knowledge of who were the donors, what their amounts were. This was not

8

information that was shared by Mr Burke with me or as I  would understand with anyone.

JOURNALIST: ... Would it have changed your position if  you'd known?

PM: Obviously it would've had to be something I would've  had to take into account, yes.

JOURNALIST: Have you taken steps to satisfy yourself that your Government's relations with Western Australia while  Mr Burke was Premier, and the Federal Party's relations with  Western Australia during that period, are completely proper

and above board? If you have taken steps, what's been the  outcome of your inquiries?

PM: Have I taken steps to see that the relationship  between -JOURNALIST: Your Government and the Federal Party with Western Australia while Mr Burke was Premier are completely  proper and above board at a time when Western Australia,  when Mr Burke was funnelling money to the Federal Party?

PM: As I understand it, in fact it's been said publicly, that whatever the Federal Party received has been, in the  relevant period, has been dealt with according to the  requirements of the legislation. That's been said publicly  by the Secretary of the Party and I understand that to be  the position.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, how would you characterise  though, that Romanian visit by Mr Burke? I mean, he'd  received $400,000 as Premier and then he'd gone as  Ambassador to Ireland, sought to go to Romania, Mr Lang  Hancock bidding, had this agreed to by Foreign Affairs even

though the Foreign Minister said it was difficult and  sensitive and not normal diplomatic practice promoting  Mr Hancock's interests. How would you characterise that?

PM: Well the one thing to say about that question, you seem to imply that Mr Hancock’s interests may not necessarily be  coincident with Australia's interests. I mean, the argument  seems to be that, let's say for the sake of argument,  they  were able to get a substantial trading benefit for Australia

from the arrangement which involved Mr Hancock then that  that is something that shouldn't be done. Now all I'm  saying is that the matter had been mentioned to me as I  indicated in the Parliament.  I left it, as far as I was  concerned these things have to be done only if the  Department would regard it as appropriate. I believe that

Senator Evans has tabled the material in regard to this. It  was a decision that was made by the Department in terms of  ensuring that other people and other interests at the  official level would be involved and they seemed to have  made the judgement, which I think is not unreasonable,  that

there could be some advantage for Australia in the mission.  Now, that doesn't seem to me to be unreasonable.  Now, after

9

the event if it's known that there had been a financial  donation from Mr Hancock to the Party - that's certainly a  question that you can legitimately refer to but I don't  think going back to the position where the Department made  that decision - query the appropriateness of the decision.

JOURNALIST: I'm asking about his behaviour.

PM: I beg your pardon.

JOURNALIST: I'm asking about his behaviour not the Department's decision. He was the one who knew he got  $400,000. So how do you characterise his behaviour in this  case? That's what I'm asking.

PM: Mr Burke was obviously one of a range of people who’d made donations - Mr Hancock was one of a range who'd made  donations.  Does that mean that because they'd made  donations, either in the period when he was Premier or if  when say he was the Ambassador to Ireland that none of those  people would ever be able to then have some attempt to get a  contract in Ireland, or when he was Premier, to do business.

It seems to me that if you're applying that test and  applying it to both sides of politics then you'd be putting  a lot of people out of business.

JOURNALIST: But other -PM: I mean, by definition you would be.

JOURNALIST: Other businessmen, Mr Hawke, can't pick and choose which Ambassador accompanies them to a particular  country - they take who's there.

PM: It wasn't a question of picking and choosing just because it was Brian Burke. It was, as I understand it, on  the basis that in the period when he was Premier he had been  involved in negotiations with Romania. It was not because  he was, they just plucked him out of the air as though he

had no relevant experience with Romania.  It was on that  basis, I understand, that the Department regarded it as  appropriate in the circumstances.  I mean, clearly if he'd  had no experience at all, if Burke had had no experience in  dealing with Romania and in the issue of iron ore and  possible sales then your question would have substance. But  if, in fact as is the case as I understand it, he had been  previously, in his capacity as Premier, involved in such  negotiations and dealings between Western Australia and  Romania it was on that basis and that basis alone that he  was then going to be involved in that next visit. And it  was on that basis and that basis alone that the Department,

I would believe, would have made the judgement they did.

JOURNALIST: Do you know whether Mr Burke made any campaign donations to any Federal members?

PM: No. I do not.

10

JOURNALIST: Are you going to ask? Are you going to ask?

PM: Well I could do that, I mean I haven't done it. I  mean, Mr Burke raised an enormous amount of money.  I have  had no - no-one's said to me that they directly received any  money from Mr Burke. I have no reason to believe, I'm quite  happy to ask if that's the case but when he raised the sort  of amounts of money that he seems to have then indirectly I

suppose every member in Western Australia, State and  Federal, would -have received some benefit from money that  went into the State and Federal election campaign. But I'm  quite happy to ask in respect of members whether they  directly received any. I've got no reason to believe that  they did.  ... three more questions.

JOURNALIST: Who brought the Romanian trip to your attention, in what terms and were you asked to approve that?

PM: No. My recollection is that Mr Burke mentioned to me,  at some stage before he went that that may arise and I  simply said, as I recall, that whether or not he could do  that in his role as Ambassador to Ireland was something that  would have to be decided by the Department.  It was not a  matter in which I could make a decision. It may have had

some merit but it was not for me to decide. As you can see  it was a matter which went to the Department and in regard  to which a formal decision was made.

JOURNALIST: Have you spoken to Mr Burke throughout this  affair or has any senior member of your staff?

PM: I have not and nor has any senior member of my staff or  junior member of my staff.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister on another matter. Just in  terms -PM: On another subject ...

JOURNALIST: Was it your decision to give the Turkish leader an Order of Australia and do you accept now that it was a  political error?

PM: I had to authorise it. It was a proposal that was put up to me. No, I don't accept that it was a political error.   Last one.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, the Resources Assessment  Commission, are you disappointed with the way in which  they've handed down their report? Has it been very useful

to the Government? Do you feel that if they're going to  proceed in this way in the future they'll just add to the  confusion rather than help the Government clarify ...

PM: I haven't had the opportunity yet of reading the whole report, let me preface my answer by saying that. So I'd  rather give you a full answer on that after I've had that  opportunity. But on the basis of what I understand the

11

Resource Assessment Commission has set out in considerable  detail the range of considerations that the Government would  have to take into account and what the implications would be  if you accepted one option or the other. I would think that  we gave them a pretty difficult task now they've

reciprocated.

JOURNALIST:  Do you intend to respond to the letters that  you've received from various ALP groups and other community  groups about their concerns about the award to President  Ozal?

PM: I would send to them the copy of the answer I gave in  the Parliament. If I have any correspondence about that I  would send the answer that I gave in the Parliament. I  think it was a pretty comprehensive answer.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, did Senator Bolkus behave properly in intervening in a contract process?

PM: I believe that Senator Bolkus has acted at all times, in this matter and in all other matters, with total  propriety.

JOURNALIST: Can we see you next week Mr Hawke?

PM: ... I would think so. In a week's time, well it's a possibility. If not next week it will be very soon  thereafter.

JOURNALIST: What about again this week?

PM: ... enjoy it that much, did you?  ends
