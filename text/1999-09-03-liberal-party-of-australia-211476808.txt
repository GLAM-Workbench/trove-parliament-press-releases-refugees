NT TO RECEIVE GOVERNMENT 
FUNDING

BOOST FOR MIGRANT SETTLEMENT

Â

Northern Territory CLP Senator Grant Tambling 
today   announced 
the Migrant Resource Centre of Central Australia and Anglicare Top End 
have been awarded funding totalling $414,231 to assist migrants, refugees 
and humanitarian entrants settle quickly and effectively in the local 
community.

Â

The Migrant Resource Centre of Central Australia (MRCCA) will receive 
a total of $154,231 over three years, and Anglicare Top End will receive 
funding of $260,000 over two years.

Â

Senator Tambling said the funding would be offered under the Department 
of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs’ Community Settlement Services 
(CSS) Scheme and would enable both the MRCCA and Anglicare Top End to 
deliver a range of settlement services to migrants. He said the funding 
would be subject to agreement by both organisations and their continuing 
compliance with service agreements which will include clearly defined 
work programs.

Â

“The settlement services to be supported by the funding will include 
the provision of community workers to provide information, counselling 
and other priority settlement services to migrants and refugees in both 
the central Australian and top end regions of the Northern Territory,” 
said Senator Tambling.

Â

“The principal objective of settlement services is to contribute 
to the adjustment by migrants and humanitarian entrants to life in Australia 
so that the can achieve independence and participate fully in Australian 
society soon after their arrival.

Â

“Both the MRCCA and Anglicare Top End have important roles to play 
in this process, by providing their clients with the advice and support 
which will equip them to enter the broader community confidently, and 
to avail themselves of the opportunities and services available to all 
Australians.”
