E&OE

TIM WEBSTER:

Tony Abbott, g’day.

TONY ABBOTT:

G’day, how are you Tim?

TIM WEBSTER:

Yeah, good. Look, first things first. Other than immigration, which you can control, how do  you accurately predict what sort of a population we are going to have in 10, 20, 30 years?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, you I suppose look at the birth rate and you make some intelligent estimates as to what  might happen to that in the future...

TIM WEBSTER:

Yep.

TONY ABBOTT:

You look at current immigration figures and you project that forward and you say this is  what’s going to happen, and then I suppose you look at the environment, you look at the  physical environment, you look at the natural environment, you look at the economy now and

possibly into the future and you make an informed judgement as best you can as to what kind  of population increase makes sense. Now, the one thing a government can’t and shouldn’t try  to alter is the decisions that Australian families make about how many kids they are going to  have…

TIM WEBSTER:

Absolutely, yeah, absolutely.

TONY ABBOTT:

I think if anything we should be in favour of the ability of families, and we should be  encouraging families to have more Australian children. But the factor which the Government  obviously should have total control over is immigration…

TIM WEBSTER:

Yes.

TONY ABBOTT:

And I guess one of the difficulties is that by losing control of our borders Mr Rudd has, to  that extent at least, compromised the Government’s ability to look after immigration.

TIM WEBSTER:

Yeah, Tony, I’ve been for a long time saying to my listeners I don’t have a problem with  more people coming to this country because we actually do need them as workers but, look,  in this city of ours, you and I both know and the Government actually knows, we’re not  prepared for them. We are miles behind at infrastructure. There’s no point in having people

here if you can’t look after them.

TONY ABBOTT:

That’s right, I mean, there are many paradoxes here. On the one hand we’ve got a continuing  unemployment problem, on the other hand you’ve got businesses that need workers and can’t  find them, including unskilled workers. So, you’ve got business saying that we need people  to keep going but then you’ve got the problem of where do they live, how do they get to  work…

TIM WEBSTER:

Absolutely.

TONY ABBOTT:

…because you can’t get a house in Sydney for under a half a million bucks anywhere close to  the CBD. Rents - a lot of people are paying $500 and $600 a week for very modest  accommodation. It costs an enormous amount of money to get around our city and the time is  a real problem. So the difficulty is that, yes, businesses say they need workers but  Government policy is not giving them workers and it’s not giving all of us the infrastructure  that we need if our cities are to remain as liveable as we’d like them to be.

TIM WEBSTER:

Yeah, look, your opponents are saying well, look, Tony Abbott wants to force people to go  and live in the bush or force them to go and work in Western Australia, but surely look we’ve  tried this before, I mean I’ve been around a long time with Albury-Wodonga and Bathurst

and Orange, and it just sort doesn’t work Tony because people either don’t want to go there,  they want to cling to the coast where the big businesses are, where the big cities are, it’s a  very difficult thing.

TONY ABBOTT:

And if someone is providing for himself or herself, sure, we have a right to say well you  know I’m doing as well as I need to and I’m going to stay put, but the suggestion that I  floated - and I did just float it - was what about people on welfare benefits, particularly on  unemployment benefits, particularly younger people on unemployment benefits. I think this  is where you do have the right as a society to say well we need a regime of carrots and sticks  here. Certainly under the former government we had a trial program for trying to encourage  younger unemployed people to move to areas where there were jobs and it was quite  successful and we can’t give up on trying to ensure that we match people to jobs and the  point I keep making Tim is that if there is a job available that you can do and you are on  unemployment benefits you are obliged to take it and I think under the Rudd Government  there has been serious weakening of that principle of mutual obligation.

TIM WEBSTER:

I doubt too many Australians would have a problem with that concept and I have to say to  you, I mean this is where sometimes politics and common sense clash. I’ve got a 20 year old,  about to be 21, just about to qualify as a mechanic and I’ve said to him ‘mate, you’d be nuts  if you didn’t investigate the possibility of getting a job in Western Australia, you’d make a  fortune doing what you do, looking after trucks’.

TONY ABBOTT:

And you don’t have to go up to the mines to do that because what’s happening is that the  mining sector in the West is attracting people out of Perth, which means that to do jobs in

Perth you are getting higher pay, generally speaking, because of the competition of the  mining sector. So, it’s not as if you’ve got to go and live in what some people I think wrongly  and unfortunately describe as the Australian equivalent of Siberia to earn a decent income -  no, because the mining sector is paying higher wages that is certainly producing competitive  pressure on wages everywhere and that’s not a bad thing for workers because it means that  they can get higher pay.

TIM WEBSTER:

I think Broome’s a fair way from Siberia mate.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well absolutely right. I mean look I’ve been to the remote parts of Australia and sure it’s not  for everyone but I think it’s beautiful, absolutely beautiful.

TIM WEBSTER:

Yeah. So, the question comes back to immigration and cutting it. What are you suggesting?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well what I’m saying is that we’ve got to bring in people on a national interest test, we’ve  got to be confident that they’re going to join the team and they’re going to make a  contribution and we’ve got to be confident that bringing people in is going to help the rest of

us and that’s why I think that we need a more rational basis for making decisions about  immigration numbers. That’s why I think we need to reconstitute the Productivity  Commission as the Productivity and Sustainability Commission and task it with giving us  independent, expert advice on the kind of numbers which, bands within which if you like, the  intake can move up and down, that will be good for the economy and which is  environmentally sustainable both in terms of the physical…

TIM WEBSTER:

Absolutely, yeah.

TONY ABBOTT:

…and the natural environment. Now, obviously part of that will be saying well, you know,  Sydney needs x thousands of new homes and that will hopefully put a bit of a bomb under the  state government not just to produce the homes but also to produce the infrastructure needed  to make them liveable.

TIM WEBSTER:



Exactly. The roads, the rail lines, the parks, the hospitals, everything else. Ok, look before I  let you go, surely it’s not Tony just about numbers, though? Don’t we need to establish who  we need, what we need them for, where we need them and then act accordingly?

TONY ABBOTT:

And one of the reasons why public acceptance of immigration substantially increased under  the Howard Government was a) the Howard Government got control of our borders by  stopping the flow of boat people and b) the Howard Government refocussed the immigration

programme on to economic migrants and away from family reunion migrants. Now, people  understood that by bringing migrants into the country who were going to boost our economy  that was in Australia’s national interests and I mean we are, let’s face it, a nation of  immigrants or the descendents of immigrants…

TIM WEBSTER:

Of course we are.

TONY ABBOTT:

…we are naturally disposed to be pro-immigration but we’ve got to be confident that the  immigration programme is helping the nation, not just helping the individual immigrant. That  was what the Howard Government did so well.

TIM WEBSTER:

Look I know you’ve got to go, you’re busy, but my listeners know my thoughts on that.  We’ve just become concierge for these boat people. Will you please, if the Australian people  elect you, remove the term ‘irregular maritime arrivals’ from the Hansard?

TONY ABBOTT:

Yes, it’s a horrible euphemism, isn’t it?

TIM WEBSTER:

They’re boat people. Well, I suppose people are questioning whether you call them legal or  illegal but all I’m saying is that they’re jumping the queue.

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, if I rocked up at Los Angeles without a visa, without papers, the Americans would give  me very short shrift indeed and they would say ‘mate you’re illegal, simple as that’.



TIM WEBSTER:

Yeah, exactly. Thanks for your time.

TONY ABBOTT:

No problems.

TIM WEBSTER:

Have a good weekend
