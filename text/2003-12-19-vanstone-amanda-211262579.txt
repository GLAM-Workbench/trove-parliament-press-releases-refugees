Senator Amanda Vanstone  MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND MULTICULTURAL AND INDIGENOUS AFFAIRS

MEDIA CENTRE

Nauru

VPS 015/2003

I am pleased to announce that two eminent Australians, the Hon John Hodges, a former immigration Minister, and Mr  Gholam Aboss, an Afghan community leader, will visit Nauru early next week.

This is an opportunity for a direct dialogue with those protesting in the offshore processing centre in Nauru and to consult  further with the International Organization for Migration (IOM) on means of resolving the situation.

Mr Hodges is also the Chair of the Immigration Detention Advisory Group and, while he will not be acting in that capacity, he  brings a wealth of experience to issues around stay in the processing centres.

Mr Hodges has performed this same role previously in both Manus and Nauru. Mr Aboss has also visited Nauru previously at  the Government's request.

IOM have been doing an outstanding job, under extremely stressful conditions, caring for the welfare of those in the centre. I  urge the failed asylum seekers to refrain from actions that are injurious to their health.

These people have had their claims heard, have been properly assessed under UNHCR guidelines, and found not to be  refugees. 420 Afghans have already returned home with financial assistance. I would encourage those in the protest to think  about return and not needlessly put their health at risk.
