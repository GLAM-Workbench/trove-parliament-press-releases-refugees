19 April 2009

TRANSCRIPT OF THE HON. MALCOLM TURNBULL MP   INTERVIEW WITH GEORGE MOORE AND PAUL B. KIDD  RADIO 2UE SYDNEY

Subjects: Labor’s failed policies on people smuggling.

E&OE…………………………………………………………………………………...

PRESENTER:

On the line, we’ve got the Leader of the Opposition, Malcolm Turnbull. Good morning.

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Good morning.

PRESENTER:

Good morning sir. Can I say first up this morning, we see where the Federal Minister for Immigration Chris  Evans has now - this story is sort of changing as each day goes by - he’s now saying that the Federal  Government is warning the nation to brace for more illegal boat arrivals, describing the surge as a threat that  must be stopped. And they’ve also confirmed that the Government had been warned by the Federal Police,  as Julie Bishop mentioned yesterday, however it does not mean that they have ignored the advice. So…

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Well I just watched him on the ABC. In fact, he’s still on there now. George, I didn’t gather he’d said quite  that but…

PRESENTER:

Well that’s the quote from Glenn Milne in the Sunday papers today.

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Okay, well he seems now to be saying… He’s not very convincing when he says that he’s not aware of any  AFP advice. His position on television has been that he says he’s not aware of it. But look the fact is…

PRESENTER:

Well, hang on a moment. Yesterday, in this article he confirmed it.

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Well, okay, I just saw him on the TV. Let’s not argue about that. The critical thing is this - the Rudd  Government changed its policy in August last year, in particular by abolishing the temporary protection  visas which were designed to provide a disincentive for people arriving by boat, unauthorised boat arrivals.  Now there was concern at the time that this would be perceived as Australia being more receptive or more  accommodating to unauthorised boat arrivals, which everyone agrees are undesirable, and since then there  has been a large number of boats arriving and around 450 unauthorised arrivals - asylum seekers arriving by  boat - versus 25 in the whole of last year and really we’ve had more since August than we’ve had in the sum  total of the last four or five years, much more. Now the Government says that their position is that  Australia’s laws have no impact on the level of arrivals. So whether our laws are tough or soft or somewhere  in-between makes absolutely no difference.

PRESENTER:

Yeah, they also say it’s part of a global trend.

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Well you see there’s no doubt there are push factors, reasons for people to leave their country of origin and  want to move somewhere else. There’s no doubt about that. But what the Government says is that there are  no pull factors. They say it doesn’t matter whether our laws are tough, even harsh, or whether they are  extremely accommodating - it makes no difference. Now, frankly, that strains credulity. It just offends  common sense that our approach to border security is irrelevant. That’s what the Government contends.

Now if the AFP has, as has been widely reported, and as one would expect, given advice to the Government  on the impact of their changes on boat arrivals, then that advice should now be made public because you see  the Government is taking a position that most people would scratch their heads and say that just doesn’t add  up.

PRESENTER:

Okay, if I could pull a little extract out of Piers Akerman’s column in the Sunday Telegraph today, and he  makes no bones of the fact that he’s a card-carrying member of the Liberal Party. What he says is…

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

I don’t think he is actually but anyway.

PRESENTER:

Well he’s not in the Labor Party, put it that way. He’s certainly not in the Labor party.

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

I don’t think he’s in any party. I think he’s in the Piers party.

PRESENTER:

He says, ‘what matters is that the Prime Minister Kevin Rudd and Immigration Minister Chris Evans  thoughtlessly gave the green light to people smugglers when the Government abolished the system of  mandatory detention, and the issuing of temporary protection visas, last year without stressing that barriers  to the traffic in human cargo still existed. Perhaps they wanted their supporters to think the problem would  evaporate if it was ignored. If so, they were wrong. Dead wrong’.

Now what are your thoughts on that?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Well, the evidence - you’ve got to just look at the evidence. As I said, back in August when the Government  abolished the temporary protection visas, they said the existence of those TPVs, which made it harder for  people who arrived by boat to get permanent status as refugees in Australia, had had no impact on the level  of arrivals, even though the level of arrivals has been extremely low for many years. So that was their  argument. Since then, there’s been a dramatic increase. Now, Labor says that’s just a coincidence. Well, you  know, again that is hard to believe because you’ve got a change in policy, as soon as the change in policy  has become effective there’s been a dramatic increase in arrivals. So what we’re entitled to know as  Australians is the facts. If the Australian Federal Police has given advice on this - and they’re of course,  they’ve got access to intelligence in Indonesia in particular - then let’s see it. The Prime Minister goes out to  thunder against people smugglers very dramatically. Why doesn’t he give us some facts?

PRESENTER:

Yes, he’s calling them scum of the earth and telling them to rot in hell. I thought that was a nice little news  grab but what is all that about? That’s a total sort of over reaction from, I saw it as an over reaction.

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Well it’s just a news grab, George. All it is, all it is, is Kevin Rudd trying to distract attention from the fact  that on the face of it his policy has resulted in a dramatic increase in people smuggling, people smugglers  targeting Australia.

PRESENTER:

Alright. Now what do we do now? Yeah, where do we go now? The situation now is with the Rudd  Government is saying - you can choose who you want to believe - they’re saying it makes no difference,  it’s part of a worldwide, a global trend. You’re saying that it’s the softening of the previous policy that’s  responsible for this. It really doesn’t matter, in one way, which one it is. What do we do now if more and  more people decide to come?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Okay. This is what I propose. I think firstly the Government must set out the facts. It must produce the AFP  report and any other advice it has on the impact of those changes. I mean let’s face it. The proof of the  pudding is always in the eating. They changed the law in August. Since August, there’s been a dramatic  increase in boat arrivals. It’s a bit rich to say that’s just a coincidence.

PRESENTER:

Yeah.

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Let’s get the facts on the table. So we must have the reports from the AFP, from the Australian Federal  Police, and any other security agencies that have advised the Government of the impact on those laws,  because common sense tells you that the people smugglers who are in a business and are no doubt hustling  customers - I mean, people are paying ten, twelve thousand US dollars to come here so they’re obviously  concerned about their prospects of getting in and the people smugglers no doubt have been using the change  in law in Australia as part of their marketing.

PRESENTER:

Yeah. Now we saw some clips on television last night of arrests and the police activity over in Indonesia. It  gives the impression that they’re giving us a hand. There is criticism from Australians saying after all the  help we gave the Indonesians after the tsunami that they could be doing more to stop it at the other end.

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Well I imagine they could always do more and I think a key element in this is cooperation with the  Indonesians. But bear in mind Indonesia is a very, very big country that’s made up of thousands of islands  so there’s thousands of ports and coves…

PRESENTER:

Jakarta I think they were coming out of, weren’t they?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Well it’s probably easier to spot them in Jakarta but the only point I’m making is it’s a big coastline to  police.

PRESENTER:

Yeah, I take your point.

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

So let’s get the facts on the table. Now, I’ve offered to sit down with the Prime Minister and discuss how we  could together agree on changes, on a new approach that will be effective because the one thing we know,  well my contention is that the current arrangements are not working. They made a change to the  arrangements and unlawful immigration has gone up.

PRESENTER:

Yeah but as we speak, as we’re sitting here speaking now, they’re leaving. There’s more boats leaving. So  something’s got to be done and something’s got to be done pretty quickly.

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

That is absolutely right and of course the problem is that the more likely it is…  I mean this is the common  sense view. This is my approach; this is what the Government is denying. My common sense approach is  this - the more likely it is that a person who gets on a boat in Indonesia to come to Australia will be able to  get permanent refugee status in Australia, the more likely they are to leave. In other words, what is the  object of getting on that boat and paying the people smuggler $12,000? It is to get permanent residence in  Australia as a refugee.

PRESENTER:

Alright, now Malcolm we took calls from a listener this morning and I think he put his finger on something  that’s really bothering a lot of people and that is that this is where the roads are paved with gold for some of  these people and he was talking about people on pensions and people who don’t earn very much all,  comparing what they get with what the assistance the asylum seekers get here. Rightly or wrongly, people  believe that they’re getting far more assistance than people who have lived and worked here all their lives  are getting, and that would be fuelling the unhappiness that people feel and the resentment that people feel  about these people coming.

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

I can understand that but can I just say this to you: I am not attacking or criticising the asylum seekers. They  are desperate people and desperate people do desperate things. But what they are seeking to do is unlawful.  We have a vested interest as Australians and as a compassionate nation in doing everything we can to stop  people smuggling. It simply doesn’t just offend the integrity of our borders and undermine the integrity of  our own legitimate refugee program, which is one of the most generous in the world, but as we’ve seen in  the last few days, every time one of these little boats sets off there is a risk of an accident or a disaster and  we do not know how many of them sink without trace.

PRESENTER:

Yeah.

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

I’m sure a number of them do. So from whichever way you look at it, whichever angle you look at it, we  must do everything we can to stop this trade. Now the Prime Minister can thunder with newsworthy slogans  as much as he likes but the fact is that since he changed the law - his decision - since he changed the law,  there has been a dramatic increase in boat arrivals…

PRESENTER:

Alright, look, thank you.

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

…and he has to take responsibility for that.

PRESENTER:

Thank you very much for your time. Good to talk to you. Thanks Malcolm.

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Thanks so much.

PRESENTER:

Nice to talk to you. Bye.
