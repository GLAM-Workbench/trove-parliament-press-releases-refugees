RAY HADLEY:

Scott Morrison, the Shadow Immigration Minister is in Darwin. The Coalition, as you’ve  probably heard already this morning, is announcing another element of their policy to  deal with illegal boat arrivals. Now the plan involves - it’s been suggested on this  program many, many times - a sort of a boat buy-back scheme in Indonesia and  payments to locals who provide information about people smugglers leading to an arrest  or disruption of the trade. The village watch programme would be similar to a scheme set  up after the Bali bombings to identify extremists. The Coalition plans to increase  Australian Federal police resources with the permission of Indonesia and Malaysia and  Sri Lanka. The policy will see navy and customs vessels only used for interception of  boats, rather than ferrying boat people to detention centres with the Opposition looking at  leasing a fleet of faster transfer vessels to take the boat people to the nearest port  including third countries. The boat people would then be flown to Nauru or Manus

Island, bypassing Australia altogether, no need to go to Christmas Island. The Shadow  Immigration Minister, as I said, in Darwin, Scott Morrison, good morning to you.

SCOTT MORRISON:

G’day Ray.

HADLEY:

It’s a funny thing. I was getting emails, I would suspect 12 months ago, people saying the  same thing - they must run out of these boats shortly, the ones that ferry people to near  Christmas Island, and then other people saying what happens when we get them and I say  well, they’re scuttled, they’re sent to the bottom of the ocean. But obviously, this is an  opportunity with the cooperation which you haven’t got from Indonesia to go to  Indonesia and set up some sort of plan to discourage people from selling their boats to  people smugglers.

MORRISON:

Well that’s right. There’s a lot of common sense out there, you and I both know, and this  suggestion has been made on many occasions. We’ve had a good close look at it. What’s  important is that when it costs Australia around about just under $13 million every time a  boat turns up in Australia, taking the preventative action and giving the Federal Police,  the Indonesian National Police or as well as over in other countries, this option to be able  to go and get that boat and go and take it out and scuttle it and take it out of the hands of  people smugglers is just another way. Plus the bounty scheme which you mentioned in  your introduction.  But you’ve also got to have the Special Operations funding up in  Indonesia, which the Government’s stripped away and hasn’t renewed and they’ve  actually taken Federal Police out of Indonesia at the moment, which just defies belief that  they would do that when they say they are getting tough on people smuggling and they  are actually taking the Federal Police out of Indonesia, who play such an important  role. So we’ll commit to that, it’s a significant commitment. We’ve got $20 million that  we are going to commit on the community outreach programme. It says ‘Village Watch’  in the Tele today. I think that’s another good way of explaining it but it is about working  with those communities to get the intelligence to get ahead of the smugglers and be able  to disrupt before anyone gets on a boat.

HADLEY:

We haven’t had a notification for two days now about boats. The last one I’ve got is 106  on the 18th of August and we don’t normally, if one arrived for instance on Wednesday or  yesterday, we wouldn’t know about that probably until later today or maybe tomorrow or  Monday at the earliest. But it stands to date for this year, 2013, at 19,100. The monthly  total has not slowed in any way, shape or form, despite what the Government says. The  monthly total stands at the moment at 1,496. Now for the same month last year, up to and  including the 30th of August, it was 1,970 and we’ve still got, obviously, 13 days to go to

include in the total and it will, I guess understandably, get close to the 1,970 by the way  things are happening at the moment.  Now, we’ve had since Kevin Rudd made the  announcement about the PNG solution, the 19th of July, 40 boats and almost 2,900  people, of which the 2,900 only 300 and a few more have gone to Manus Island.   Meaning that 2,500-2,600 are still on Christmas Island.

MORRISON:

That’s right, that’s absolutely right. I mean, only under the Labor Party could they think  almost 3,000 people turning up on 40 boats was a success. That’s Labor’s standards and  that, I think, speaks for itself. The weather also, as you know Ray, plays significantly into  this about when they get on boats and my understanding is that the weather’s been  playing up a fair bit with things of late and I think, at the moment, things are pretty messy  up there at the moment at sea. So I’m not expecting to see anything today or something  like that, but you never know because we know people go and take these risks. That’s  why we’re announcing what we are today, you’ve got to do turn backs, you’ve got to do  offshore processing, you’ve got to do temporary protection visas, all of those things, but  you’ve also got to do the practical things up in the region as well. If we want strong  borders in Australia, we need strong borders in the region. It’s not about just going to  conferences and talking about it, you’ve got to actually do things like give your police the  resources to do the job. It’s like trying to tackle crime in Sydney, you’ve got to give your  police the resources and have the people and you were mentioning Ray King before, out  there in McMahon. Ray King knows all about that, he knows all about the resources you  need to fight crime in Western Sydney.

HADLEY:

Well just one other thing, I’ll come back to Mr King and Mr Bowen many times through  the course of the morning because the treatment of Ray King by Mr Bowen and others is  reprehensible. Absolutely.  In fact, while I’m talking to you I’m just reading an article  here published today in the Australian where the ALP Campaign Headquarters  spokesman Andy, I should say, Adam Collins, stuck by the party’s allegation against Ray  King, when asked to provide proof to back them up by the Australian he cited public  documents he declined to identify. Well the public documents may well be the Royal  Commission where he’s cleared of any wrongdoing and no charges were raised against  him, as was the case with many police officers. But back to Darwin. You know that I  have my aeroplane trackers here. I’ve got people that email me and tell me when flights  of Qantas - we’ve had four in three days bringing hundreds and hundreds of people south  to either Brisbane, Melbourne, Sydney or Adelaide. Now they won’t tell us where they  are being brought to, all we know is that there was a Qantas plane going up empty and  my plane trackers can tell me by what altitude they are flying at that they are empty, they  pick up people and come back. But it appears the Department of Immigration, who were  telling me where they were going to three weeks ago, have stopped in election mode  telling me where they go.

MORRISON:



Well I can tell you where they are probably going, they are being released into the  community and the Government’s been releasing people into the community. There’s  around about 20,000. They still refuse point blank to give police around the country the  address details of where people are being released into the community. There is still no  Memorandum of Understanding between our State Police in New South Wales or in  Western Australia where I was earlier this week, where this became relevant when five  people went over the fence, and there’s no arrangement between the Western Australian  State Police and the Commonwealth, so it all goes into a black hole. The cooperation  between the police or the health services or so on, when you’ve got people going into the  community, is really important for the reasons we’ve talked on your programme about  many times, and they just refuse to lift a finger on it. It’s extraordinarily frustrating and  that’s why it’s important we understand the challenges the police face. We’ve got Russell  Matheson out there in Macarthur as well, and there’s another bloke Jason Wood who is  running, he’s a police officer down in Victoria, he’s running in the seat of La Trobe, he’s  been in the Parliament before. So, on our side, we tend to get this and that’s why it would  be great to see Ray King there with us on the other side of an election.

HADLEY:

Ok thanks for your time, Scott.

MORRISON:

Thanks a lot, Ray.

HADLEY:
