5 August 2004  EXPANSION TO SERVICES FOR NEWLY ARRIVED MIGRANTS  AND REFUGEES

The Nationals Member for Riverina Kay Hull today welcomed the announcement of  the  expansion of the Reconnect and Job Placement, Employment and Training (JPET)  program to benefit Griffith.  “This means new services will be funded in areas where there are high levels of  settlement  by young newly arrived migrants and refugees,” Mrs Hull said.

“Previous programs have been highly successful in providing support, counselling  and  basic life skills, in addition to valuable education, training and work opportunities.  “The Australian Government will allocate around $222,000 in funding to the Murray  River region over four years, which will take in Griffith and surrounding areas.  “All existing JPET and Reconnect services in this region will be invited to apply for  funding.”  Mrs Hull said migrants and refugees find these services extremely useful in adapting  to  their new community and the Australian language and culture.  “The provision of these services is a fantastic resource that enhances Griffith’s  reputation  as an ideal place for migrants and refugees to settle, with the knowledge they can  access  support networks and assistance.”  Family and Community Services expects to invite organisations to apply in late  September  2004.
