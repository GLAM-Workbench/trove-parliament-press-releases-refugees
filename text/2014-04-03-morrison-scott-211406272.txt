The outcomes of the meeting were as follows:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Ministers welcomed the decision by the PNG  Cabinet that allows the first tranche of initial  assessments to be delivered to transferees  within a month.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The process of Refugee Status Determination is  well advanced, with two-thirds of transferees  having had initial interviews at the Regional  Processing Centre.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The development of a review process for those  initially assessed not to be refugees was  underway and due for completion in April.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ A refugee visa has been approved by the  Government of PNG for those determined to be  refugees. The visa will provide for work rights  and freedom of movement.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Ministers noted that the PNG Expert Panel on  Settlement convened on 1 April with a  scheduled report back to the PNG Government  at the end of April on recommendations on  implementing refugee resettlement.

It was anticipated the first  refugees could be resettled in June 2014.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Ministers reiterated that all persons transferred  to PNG under the RRA who are found to be  refugees will be resettled in PNG. No-one will  be resettled in Australia.

their home country or another country where  they have a right of entry - no-one found not to  be a refugee will be transferred to Australia.
