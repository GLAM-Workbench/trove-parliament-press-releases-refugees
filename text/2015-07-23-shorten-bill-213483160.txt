THE HON. BILL SHORTEN  LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION  MEMBER FOR MARIBYRNONG

E&OE TRANSCRIPT  TELEVISION INTERVIEW  SUNRISE  THURSDAY, 23 JULY 2015

SUBJECT: Boat turn back policy

DAVID KOCH, HOST: Now to Bill ShortenÃ¢ÂÂs change of heart, the Labor leader wants  his party to turn around its policy on asylum seeker boats. Mr Shorten is urging Labor's  National Conference this weekend to adopt the Abbott Government's controversial turn  back policy if it wins office.



[CLIP] BILL SHORTEN, LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION, 7:30, 22 JULY 2015:  I think it's clear that the combination of regional resettlement with offshore  processing and also the turn back policy is defeating people smugglers.

KOCH: Mr Shorten admits Labor made mistakes on immigration policy when last in  government and the Opposition Leader joins me now from Melbourne. Bill Shorten,  thanks for your time. Now you have previously said quote, “There's no doubt in my mind  that the Coalition's boat person policy is absolutely not working.” What's changed your  mind?

SHORTEN: Well, nearly two years on, youÃ¢ÂÂd have to say that the combination of  regional resettlement and, indeed, in part, boat turn backs is defeating people  smugglers, which is part of our goal and also it's preventing drowning at sea. So what's  motivating me is, how do we stop people smugglers and how do we prevent the  drowning at sea? And I think it's important to be honest with my party and the nation  and, if I was to form a government, I would want the option of boat turn backs where  safe to do so on the table.

KOCH: But since that quote two years ago, youÃ¢ÂÂve stuck to your guns - the party has  stuck to their guns, saying this is the wrong policy. Does your turnaround undermine  your credibility?

SHORTEN: Well, I think what would be a more difficult situation is having a policy which  would - which I believe - would incentivise people smugglers, criminals to exploit  vulnerable people - to entice people on to unsafe boats and then they drown at sea.  WeÃ¢ÂÂre all familiar -

KOCH: So you are admitting Labor's policy in the past - and as it currently stands - is  an incentive to people smugglers?

SHORTEN: Well, I believe a policy which says that, allows people smugglers to exploit  vulnerable people, refugees, asylum seekers, to try and chance their hand on unsafe  boats at sea has led to drownings.

KOCH: And your current policy has done that?

SHORTEN: Well I believe that the Labor Government before the last election was  getting things back on track, with promoting regional resettlement. I think that has been  a big part of defeating the people smugglers. But what I also recognise is that the failure  of the Parliament, including the Liberals and the Greens, to support the Malaysia  solution which would have seen regional resettlement, that failure, after that, we saw  hundreds of people drown at sea. So yes, I do accept that mistakes were made.

Also, but more recently, Kochie, and you've covered this matter, or the TVs have  covered it, you look at some of the dreadful scenes in the Mediterranean where there  are people smuggling syndicates taking advantage of the biggest number of displaced  peoples in the world, over 60 million refugees, seeing hundreds of people drown  between Africa and Italy - I think we've all got an obligation to look at our own  preconceptions and our own previous views and tackle them.

KOCH: Do you reckon you will be able to get this through your Labor Party Conference,  this turnaround, because a lot of your colleagues have come out in the last 12 hours, 24  hours, and said, Ã¢ÂÂover my dead bodyÃ¢ÂÂ.

SHORTEN: Well, I think that all of the people in this debate in the Labor party are  motivated by wanting to see fair treatment of refugees. I want to see us do our fair share  to help the problem of refugees and help the challenges people face when displaced  from their own countries. But I also think we have an obligation to make sure that  people are safe -

KOCH: Have you always thought this? Did you tell Kevin Rudd this years ago, when he  brought in the Labor policy?

SHORTEN: Well, I don't think that when the previous policy was brought in, people  foresaw the extent to which the people smugglers would exploit the system and I do  know that previous Labor Governments worked hard with the Malaysia solution,  remember that was when we were going to resettle people and the High Court said no.  Then when we went to Mr Abbott when he was Leader of the Opposition, he and the  Greens conspired to defeat that measure. So I think that when we pushed along the  path of regional resettlement, that LaborÃ¢ÂÂs recognised we need a stronger approach to  turn-back in terms of people smugglers to prevent drownings at sea.

KOCH: Not to turn back the boats, though?

SHORTEN: To be fair to the previous Labor Government, at some points in the  previous Labor Government -

KOCH: Which was you. You were in the previous Labor Government.

SHORTEN: Indeed, the proposition of turn backs wasn't put as being possible. But  clearly it is. And what I will do, if I get the privilege of forming a government, is I'll act in  what I believe to be the best interests of Australia and that is to have policies which  don't lead to criminals encouraging people to get on unsafe boats and drown at sea.

In good conscience, if you know that that's the risk of your policy, which I do have that  view, well then I think I've got to stand up.

KOCH: Bill Shorten, thanks for your time.

SHORTEN: Thanks Kochie.
