Strengthening Australia’s Borders

Budget Media Release

Tuesday, 8 May 2007

The 2007-08 Budget will strengthen Australia’s borders against the  increasingly sophisticated criminal networks which engage in people-smuggling.

Ten additional Airline Liaison Officers (ALOs) will be placed at overseas  airports, to increase our successful overseas operations that counter attempts  to smuggle people into Australia via international airports.

More than $12 million will be spent on this initiative over four years to help  ensure our borders are protected against attempts to illegally enter Australia  by sea or by air.

The Australian Government is also responding to the challenges of regional  border security by funding additional measures in source and transit countries.

The Australian Government will also provide funding of $7.7 million to the  International Organization for Migration (IOM) in Indonesia.

Increases in funding in the Budget bring to more than $20 million the total  projected expenditure in 2007-08 for the care and management of irregular  migrants and to address the situation of refugees and displaced people.

People-smuggling is a sophisticated and very profitable business. The  international criminal networks which engage in this repugnant activity show  no care or concern for the people they smuggle or the lives they endanger.

It is important that the Australian Government does all in its power to prevent  and deter the perpetrators of this repugnant criminal activity.

Strengthening Australia’s Borders

Strategy to prevent people-smuggling - additional Airline Liaison Officers

Why is this important?

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ These additional 10 Airline Liaison Officers (ALOs) will provide an enhanced presence at  key overseas airports.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The measure will provide a more comprehensive coverage of locations and flights, as well  as providing increased targeting capabilities, enhancing the disruption of people-smuggling  by air.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The additional ALOs will reduce the potential for the entry of undocumented or  unauthorised arrivals across Australia’s borders.



Who will benefit?

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ All Australians will benefit from enhanced border security arrangements.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The measure will reduce the overall cost to the community of onshore processing of  unauthorised air arrivals and those seeking to avoid border controls.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The Australian Government will have more flexible and prepared ALO resources for  deployment in emergency situations.



What funding is the government committing to the initiative?

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ $12.1 million over four years.



What have we done in the past?

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Currently, ALOs assist international airport staff to combat document and identity fraud,  irregular people movements and contribute to global border integrity efforts.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ This measure extends the coverage and responsiveness of the existing network.



When will the initiative conclude?

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ This measure is ongoing.

Strategy to prevent people-smuggling - assistance for management and care of irregular  immigrants in Indonesia

Why is this important?

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ This proposal will provide funding to the International Organization for Migration (IOM) to  improve Indonesia’s immigration management facilities.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ It will develop guidelines with associated training for the management and care of  intercepted people in accordance with international human rights standards and relevant  international obligations.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ It will provide training and resourcing for a dedicated unit to facilitate voluntary returns.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ This proposal is needed because of the pressures placed on Indonesian facilities.

What have we done in the past?

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ It will reduce incentives for refugees and displaced people to utilise the services of people  smugglers and lower the risk of irregular migration to Australia.

Strengthening Australia’s Borders

Prospective illegal immigrants - improved arrangements in transit countries

Why is this important?

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The Prospective Illegal Immigrants Arrangements in Transit Countries (PIIATC) initiative  provide a safe and humane alternative for asylum seekers to have their claims considered in  transit countries to discourage them from undertaking illegal and risky sea ventures.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Prospective illegal migrants in transit countries are given care, such as accommodation, food  and emergency medical assistance, while claims are considered.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The International Organization for Migration (IOM) administers the provision of care. The  IOM refers any people who indicate a possible need for protection to the United Nations  High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) or, where a country has its own refugee status  determination procedures, to relevant national authorities.



Who will benefit?

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Prospective illegal immigrants who can have their claims processed while they are safely  accommodated.



What funding is the government committing to the initiative?

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ An increase of $1.2 million over that provided in 2006-07 to meet the increased numbers of  people cared for under the programme.



What have we done in the past?

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The PIIATC programme, formerly the Regional Cooperation Arrangements, was established  in 2000.



When will the initiative conclude?

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The initiative is ongoing.



Strengthening Australia’s Borders

Combating trafficking in persons - extension and expansion

Why is this important?

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The work of the senior immigration official in Bangkok in profiling syndicates and potential  victims of trafficking has been a crucial element in restricting the incidence of people  trafficking to Australia.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The appointment of two more senior officials will expand and enhance this work.

Who will benefit?

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The Australian community through restricting people trafficking to Australia.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Potential victims of people-trafficking. Information obtained will be used by the offshore  and onshore network to develop profiles of people-trafficking activity and stop it at its  source.

What funding is the government committing to the initiative?

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ $3.3 million over four years.

What have we done in the past?

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The senior official’s position in Thailand has been a key part of the whole-of-government  strategy.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The officer’s work in vetting the immigration caseloads to Australia and engaging  stakeholders has resulted in people-traffickers being charged and brought to trial in  Australia.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The role has also acted as a deterrent to potential traffickers in Thailand.  The work of the  official in profiling syndicates and potential victims of trafficking has assisted in stopping  people traffickers from accessing visas for Australia.

When will the initiative conclude?

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Funding is ongoing. The senior official positions will be reviewed internally.
