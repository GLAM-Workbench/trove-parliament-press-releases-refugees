DIPLOMATIC APPOINTMENT: AMBASSADOR TO AFGHANISTAN

I have confirmed the appointment of Mr Martin Quinn as Australia’s new Ambassador to  Afghanistan.  He will succeed Mr Brett Hackett who has been Ambassador since September  2006.  Mr Quinn is expected to take up his appointment in March 2008.

Australia is making a substantial contribution to international efforts to stabilise Afghanistan.  Australia is the largest non-NATO contributor to the UN-mandated International Security  Assistance Force (ISAF) and a major aid donor.

Australia has nearly 1000 troops based in Oruzgan Province in southern Afghanistan.   Australian special forces are engaged in security operations, while Australian military  engineers are rebuilding infrastructure such as schools, bridges, wells and hospitals in  Oruzgan Province. Four Australian Federal Police officers have also been deployed to  Afghanistan to improve the counter-narcotics and policing capacity of the Afghan  Government.

Australia has also recently increased aid to Afghanistan, announcing in August 2007 an  amount of $115 million over two years.  This will bring our total aid commitment to $450  million since 2001.  Our aid is helping to build the capacity of the Government of  Afghanistan, to enhance education and health care opportunities for Afghans and to support  the return and reintegration of Afghan refugees.

Mr Quinn is a career foreign service office and is currently Counsellor (Political) at the  Australian Embassy, Seoul.  Mr Quinn has also served as First Secretary in Jakarta (1993-95)  and Third Secretary in Bangkok (1987-91).  In Canberra he has held a variety of foreign and  trade policy positions.  He helped prepare Australia’s first White Paper on Foreign and Trade  Policy (1996-97) and was a member of the AUSFTA negotiation and implementation team  (2003-05).  Mr Quinn holds a Bachelor of Arts degree with honours in history and  government from Sydney University.  He is married with four children.
