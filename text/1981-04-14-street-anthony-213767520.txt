Ex c e l l e n c i e s , La d i e s and Gentlemen

I n welcoming you to Au s t r a l i a  and to Canberra for the s i x t h

Ambassador  Re y e s , , as our guest  in Au s t r a l i a .

I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO REITERATE THE .

IMPORTANCE OF ASEAN AND THE COUNTRIES OF ASEAN FOR AUSTRALIA,

AN IMPORTANCE WHICH I EXPECT TO GROW IN THE FUTURE. I n MY

FIRST SIX MONTHS AS MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS I HAVE

FOUND MY ATTENTION CONSTANTLY DRAWN TO ASEAN: WHETHER IN

THE CONTEXT OF WHAT ASEAN MEMBERS SAY AT NON-ALIGNED

Me e t i n g s , or at the Un i t e d  Na t i o n s , or in c o n s id e r a t io n  of

THE AFFAIRS OF OUR REGION IN MY RECENT DISCUSSIONS IN ÃÂªÃÂÃÂÃÂ¥ÃÂ,

Pek in g  and Wa s h in g t o n , or in r e l a t io n  to ASEAN' s own growing

i d e n t i t y . ASEAN is  a constant  reference  p o in t  i n Au s t r a l i a ' s

INTERNATIONAL CONCERNS. . ' .

BEGAN IN 1 9 7 4 . I AM AWARE OF HOW MUCH CUMULATIVE EFFORT .

AND ENTHUSIASM HAS BEEN PUT INTO BUILDING A REGIONAL

RELATIONSHIP WHERE A FEW YEARS AGO THERE WERE ONLY SEPARATE

BILATERAL CONTACTS. SOME OF YOU HAVE BEEN CLOSELY INVOLVED

SINCE THOSE. EARLY DAYS', WHILE OTHERS BENEFIT, AS I DO FROM

YOUR EXPERIENCE AND FROM THE WORK OF OUR PREDECESSORS.

WE ARE BEGINNING TO REAP THE BENEFIT OF THOSE EFFORTS,

PERHAPS IN A WAY WHICH FEW COULD HAVE EXPECTED WHEN OUR

COUNTRIES FIRST SET ABOUT THE TASK OF DEVISING THE MEANS OF

THIS MULTILATERAL CONSULTATION.

We HAVE NOW ESTABLISHED A STRUCTURE OF REGULAR MEETINGS AT

ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT, AN ACHIEVEMENT OF WHICH WE CAN BE

p r o u d . Me e t in g s  a t Mi n i s t e r i a l  l e v e l  t a k e  p la c e  r e g u l a r l y .

AFFECTING THE RELATIONSHIP.
