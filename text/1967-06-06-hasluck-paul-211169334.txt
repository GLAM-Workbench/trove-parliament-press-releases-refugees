6th June, 1967.

MIDDLE EAST

In response to questions, the Minister for External Affairs,

Mr Paul Hasluck, said in Auckland that he hoped for an early

termination of hostilities. Mr Hasluck said he hoped also that

any powers with influence in the region would do what they could, in

the Security Council or by direct contacts, to try to bring about a

cessation of fighting.

Mr Hasluck is keeping in close touch with Canberra and

special arrangements have been made to let him have full material on

what is going on.
