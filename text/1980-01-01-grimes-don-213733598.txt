GOVERNMENT MISREPRESENTATION ON SPENDING PROGRAMS

In the week before Christmas Senator Guilfoyle issued press  releases to announce proposed spending on aged persons  housing, handicapped assistance and senior citizens* centres.

Her release on aged persons housing was headed ’Major new  $225 program*, a statement she was forced to retract the  following day.

Each of her press statements merits close attention.

(1) Aged persons housing

The Fraser Government introduced the first $225 million  three-year program in 1976 to disguise two significant  cutbacks they had made. ' J

Firstly, the level of subsidy was cut from $4:$1 to $2 ;:$1-Secondly, the funding level was to drop from $71.5 million  (the last year of the Labor Government) to $45 million.

But Senator Guilfoyle did not even honour that commitment.

Instead of spending $225 million in three years, she spent only  $147 million. Instead of providing 15,000 beds, she provided  only 10,622. It became a five-year program, not a three-year  program.

On 18 December last when she announced her 'major new* $225 million  program for the second time (to begin in I98O-81),  I pointed out  some of the above facts. I also pointed out that to claim that  the Government was continuing 'its high level of support for  aged and disabled persons accommodation'  as Senator Guilfoyle did,  was thoroughly misleading.

To continue the $225 million program as announced in 1976 would  now require $330 million just to remain at that level. This  means that the program has been effectively cut by $105 million -  if the Government carries it out.

(2) Handicapped persons program

This announcement promised $153 million for three years from  1980-81, which will keep it on line with the yearly amounts  spent since 1975/76. That is, again, if they spend it. The Government has been indulging in saving money allocated

in the Budget rather than spending it.

This has been particularly notorious in the homeless persons  area,  but handicapped organisations are rightly resentful of  the fact that last year $4 million which could not be spent  by the end of the financial year was not reallocated to groups  which were entitled to reimbursement for approved spending. That $4 million was returned unspent to the Department of Finance.

The allocation of $39 million this financial year is $13 million  less than last year's, and the handicapped groups will be  particularly watchful to see they collect all of it.

(3) Senior Citizens Centres

The announcement that $12 million will be available for the  next three years for senior citizens centres is another way  of indicating that the money will be cut.

Since 1975 a steady $4 million has beetiset aside each year  for the centres.

If the Government were to keep up the same rate of growth  it would be allocating at least $18 million, not $12 million,  for the three years from 1980/81.

Senator Guilfoyle is guilty of deliberate deception when she  claims in the same press release that *  spending under the  States Grants (Home Care) Act has increased significantly  under the Fraser Government*.

As indicated above,  in real terms grants for senior citizens  centres have been cut.

In the other areas,  home care and welfare officer subsidies,   spending has increased only because States have been forced  to spend more to keep up the same services, because in 1978  the Government cut the subsidy from $2j$l to $1:$1 and forced  a larger share of the burden on to the States.

When Senator Guilfoyle claims spending increases she tries  to make it appear that the Fraser Government has spent  significantly more. However,  as in other areas such as  health centres and women's refuges, it is the Fraser Government  which pays less and makes the States and local government

increase their payout.

YOUTH EMERGENCY ACCOMMODATION

The Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs,  Mr Viner,   has announced that the Standing Task Force on Youth Affairs  will be examining the accommodation needs of young people,   particularly the homeless.

He said in Melbourne two weeks ago: "It is difficult to ascertain the full extent of the problems but the indications  are that the numbers of young people needing accommodation are  high and may be increasing."

He should be looking at the evidence already before him.

The Victorian Consultative Committee on Social Development,   helped by the Victorian Government, has produced a well  documented report showing that 15,000 young people each year  in Victoria need crisis accommodation.

His Standing Task Force has had that report for many months. What has it done about it?

The Youth Action Coalition in Victoria has submitted applications  demonstrating need from church and community organisations  totalling $1.2 million, yet only $400,000 is available. As they pointed out in a letter to Senator Guilfoyle, the cost of

a youth refuge run by voluntary agencies is significantly less  than the cost of remand facilities, which is sometimes the only  alternative.

The Dandenong District Benevolent Society drew attention to the  lack of low rental accommodation for Ã¢ÂÂ youth denied parental  shelter and waiting for unemployment benefits to be paid; this  particular segment are frequently found sleeping in parks,

showgrounds,  telephone boxes or any other building which will  provide shelter; *  sleeping out *  frequently brings them to the  notice of police who in turn have no option but to take them  into custody - thus a criminal is born."

A study conducted by Shelter in New South Wales last year showed that the major single cause of homelessness in the inner city  was the difficulty in meeting rental payments. Their report states:

"From the $36 or $51.45 unemployment benefit they had to pay  out between $30 and $40 for a single room. Many got behind  1  after one or two months and either left or were evicted for  arrears."

In Leichhardt 63% of the homeless were single, and mainly young,  while 53% were unemployed. 46% of the demand from Inner Sydney  and 6l% of the demand in rural New South Wales came from people  rendered homeless within 24 hours.

Other States have also documented some of the size and nature  of the problem,  and the caring organisations are in no doubt  about its dimension.

An interdepartmental committee will not prevent kids going on  to skid row. Action might do so.

If the Fraser Government is serious about young people in crisis,   most of whom are suffering as a result of their own or family  unemployment, they can make an early start to avert disaster by:

(a) raising the unemployment benefit from the impossibly  depressed levels of $36 a week for the single unemployed  person under 18 and $51Â·45 a week for the single adult;

(b) insisting that Senator Guilfoyle ensures that Homeless Persons Assistance allocations are spent. Only $6.55 million  was spent out of the $16.65 million set aside in the past  four years.  $4.5 million is to be spent this year, all of

it on two large projects in Brisbane. For the rest of  Australia outside Brisbane, the program has effectively  come to a dead stop.

(c) making money immediately available from the joint State and  Social Security Department grants for suitable pilot  projects providing emergency housing.

OTHER CONSEQUENCES OF YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT

We hope that Mr Viner's belated interest in crisis accommodation  for youth will now be matched by responsibility for other social  effects on almost 40% of the under-20s now out of work.

He could ask his Standing Task Force on Youth Affairs to investigate  how much the how level of unemployment benefits,  the demoralisation  of unemployment and the Government's punitive policies towards the  unemployed are related to social problems.

When I asked the Minister last year whether his department  investigated the social consequences of youth unemployment such  as ill health, drug abuse, crime and suicide - and if they did  not would he authorise such inquiry,  Mr Viner replied:

"The Office of Youth Affairs has prepared an annotated  bibliography of Australian and overseas published material  on the social consequences of youth unemployment. Research  results on causal relationships between unemployment and

crime,  suicide, ill-health and drug abuse are generally  inconclusive."

In other words, the librarian has done a properly professional  job in collecting materials.  However,  the Minister is not  prepared to initiate action to learn of the dire social evils  which may befall the unemployed; He is prepared to watch

suicide, vandalism, drug abuse and crime continue among  the young unemployed without admitting that there may be any  connection with government policy of keeping unemployment  benefit well below the poverty level.  Indifference to and  neglect of the young impoverished by Government policies  are attitudes of Mr Viner which need a sharp reversal.

CONTROL OF INVALID PENSIONS

The latest directive headed 'Control of Invalid Pensions'  ordered by the Director-General of Social Services gives rise  to concern because it focuses on a person's percentage  incapacity for work,  which is already a very difficult area.

While the Act defines "permanently incapacitated for work" as  85*/Â» incapacity, it requires the wisdom of Solomon to understand  what this means in practice. Total incapacity is relatively  easy to establish, but what about cases in the grey area  nearer 8^Â°/o? The legal opinion used by Mr Lanigan acknowledges

that "there is an air of unreality in assessing the difference  between incapacity of, say, 80 Â° / o  and 85%". It continues, "It might be supposed that the two persons so assessed would  be equally likely to be unemployed and unemployable; but only

the higher assessment would qualify for the invalid pension. The basis for qualification for invalid pension might be more  rational were there a graduated pension payable for substantial  incapacity falling short of total incapacity".

The absence of such a graduated pension and the issue of  Mr Lanigan's 'control'  measures,  with a refusal to take the  labour market into account, can mean an 'all or nothing'  result in the application for or review of an invalid pension.

At present 224,000 people receive invalid pensions, and  Mr Lanigan's revised directive is already causing anxiety  in organisations acting for the mentally and physically  handicapped and community organisations whose clients have

chronic disabilities.

As I have said, if there are inadequate rehabilitation  opportunities and no jobs at the end of training anyhow,  the legal opinion that "the quadraplegic can often be trained  to do something" is meaningless.

If the chronic alcoholic, the mentally disordered and the  physically handicapped are not considered incapacitated to  the level of 85% by the pension examiners,  they may not qualify  for any other social service payment. They may not be 'able*

to work and cannot therefore obtain unemployment benefit. They may not be eligible for sickness benefit, generally a  short-term benefit related to temporary loss of earning  capacity. They may not qualify for special benefit under

its severe hardship provisions.

They could lose not only the pension but their health and  pharmaceutical benefits but other transport and telephone  concessions. Even if they are judged eligible for unemployment  sickness or special benefits they would not be eligible for

fringe benefits and would suffer a severe drop in income  though their personal situations were unchanged.

They would also be financially penalised if they took on  work for rehabilitation purposes,  for they could retain no  more than $6 a week above the benefit, instead of $20 a week  above the invalid pension.

6 .

The Department of Social Security is flying blind in its  attempt to cut down on payments of invalid pensions. It does not really know who they are and how they live. It keeps no figures on the type of illness or disability

for which those pensions are granted.  .

In spite of requests year after year, it can provide no  figures on the numbers of unemployed who are transferred to '   sickness benefits or invalid pensions,  nor on the numbers  transferred from invalid pensions to benefits.

Yet without such knowledge,  and with the International  Year of the Disabled Person approaching,  Mr Lanigan is  attempting to penalise the 84% incapacitated and unemployable  invalid with no hope of finding work in order to cut costs. He has placed the interests of the *  taxpayer* higher than

the interests of physically and mentally disabled people  who are his department's clients.

IMPORTANT QUESTIONS TO BE DROPPED FROM THE 1981 CENSUS

It is disturbing news that questions on the extent and type  of handicap in the population, asked for the first time in  the 1976 Census,  will not be asked in 1981, the International  Year of the Disabled Person.

Nor will questions on child care,  though International Year  of the Child was meant to have a continuing impact.

Successive government reports have stressed the lack of  data on the types and severity of handicap and the need to  have that information to plan services.

When the Fraser Government decided to delay processing the  results of the 1976 Census to save $2 million, Senator Guilfoyle  told the Senate:

"I agree with the honourable senator (Grimes) that the data  from the Census is of vital importance to the Department  of Social Security and to other departments which provide  personal services.  I can give the assurance that I am

treating this matter as one of priority.  I need the  information not only with regard to poverty but also with  regard to programs for aged and handicapped people. I have been exerting whatever influence I have to see

that there will be an examination of these statistics  and that they will be related to our programs." (25.2.1977)

The Williams Report on Education, Training and Employment  stated:

"Unfortunately the information on the number of adolescent  and other handicapped people, and on the effects of  special education in overcoming or reducing the degrees  of handicap, is so fragmentary that there is at present  no firm basis for the appraisal of possible national  policies." (February 1979)

7 .

Data users had asked for the topic to be included on the  grounds that:

it would identify the handicapped and provide a way to  analyse them according to other characteristics such as  age, sex and living arrangements;

it would identify people with various individual  handicaps and combinations of handicaps, providing  information on which to base aid policies;

it would give data on which to evaluate present services  and plan future ones - such as rehabilitation units,  sheltered workshops and special accommodation.

The Australian Bureau of Statistics will undertake instead  a survey which they believe will provide more detailed and  sensitive information. I welcome any survey that does so,  but I believe that consistent and changed patterns of social

and physical disability should form part of our regular  census information. Census data believed unreliable should  be reworked, but random survey work should supplement and  not replace census data.

In the same way, I believe the question on retirement benefits  should be retained to make possible planning of national  pension and superannuation schemes.

The Government is making a serious mistake in throwing away  this opportunity to acquire valuable social and economic . information.

If Senator Guilfoyle expressed the same views in Cabinet  about its importance as she did in the Senate, then one  wonders if she was supported by the Ministers for Employment  and Youth Affairs, Education, Health and Aboriginal Affairs  who also need regular and up to date information on which

to plan their programs.
