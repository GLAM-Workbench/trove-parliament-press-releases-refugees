CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED ÃÂ ÃÂÃÂ¤ÃÂ¤ÃÂ¤. DELIVERY

SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER  OPENING SESSION OF THE  76TH NATIONAL CONGRESS OF THE RSL  CANBERRA, 2 SEPTEMBER 1991

Your Excellency the Governor-General,  Brigadier Alf Garland, RSL President,  Dr Hewson, Distinguished Guests, .

Ladies and Gentlemen,

The extraordinary pace of change in the international arena  in recent years - reaching a remarkable climax over the past  two weeks - will I know make many people wonder whether we  need to rethink our defence policy.

I want to address that issue today, because defence is one  of the fundamentals of our national life, and in periods of  rapid change it is more than ever important to make sure we  have got the fundamentals right. Perhaps the best way to

refresh our sense of those fundamentals is to look back a  bit.

In the midst of all this great unfolding of history,  literally before our eyes, it would be easy to lose sight of  the past. But in a very real sense, the extraordinary  events since 1989 are the culmination of events which began  more than half a century ago - events in which this nation  of ours, and your members in particular, played a direct and  memorable part.

We have had some important anniversaries recently, and we  will soon see many more. Next month sees the fiftieth  anniversary of the decision of the Australian Parliament to  hand over responsibility for wartime administration and the  defence of Australia to the Australian Labor Party under the

leadership of John Curtin - a responsibility which was  magnificently discharged.

This year the RSL has participated in the very successful  commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the battles of  Greece and Crete. Over the next few months we will mark the  fiftieth anniversary of the start of the Pacific War, and  remember the terrible events of late 1941 and 1942. I know  commemorative events have been planned for Darwin, Singapore

and the Coral Sea, and I am sure there will be others. I  wish them well.

These commemorations will recall, not just for you, but for  younger generations of Australians, the most dangerous days  of Australia's history, when we faced imminent threat of an  invasion which we seemed powerless to resist.

Remembering the Pacific War brings us back to the bedrock of  our national life - to the survival of that national life  itself, and to the fundamental purpose of that struggle and  that sacrifice - the survival of Australian democracy. It

reminds us what defence policy should be all about - that we  should never again find ourselves in the position we were in  between December 1941 and May 1942.

For that reason, my Government's defence policy is based on  a principle of great simplicity; that the first priority of  the Australian Defence Force must be the defence of  Australia. Our aim is to build a defence force which can  defend Australia without assistance from the combat forces  of other nations. We call that policy self-reliance.

But focusing our defence policy on the defence of Australia  is not only the logical reflection of our historical  experience and national priorities. It also provides the  basis for a practical, workable, efficient defence

structure, and it defines an enduring goal that gives  stability to defence planning. Those points are worth  explaining in a little detail.

First, the priority we give in developing the ADF to the  defence of Australia provides a firm basis to the rest of  our defence planning. Because we know exactly what we are  trying to do, it is easier to work out how to do it.

Having determined that the priority task of the ADF is the  defence of Australia, the Government has developed and  articulated a military strategy of layered defence which  sets out how that job is to be done.

Next, we have set down in detail the defence capabilities we  need to make that military strategy work. By defining a  concrete goal, our defence policy has gone beyond the usual  strategic platitudes. It has defined exactly the  capabilities we need to do the job.

A 3.

And then we have set about the long job of building those  capabilities. The contracts have been signed and the work  is now being done on the largest defence investment program  in Australia's peacetime history. New ships and submarines;

new airbases and radars; new helicopters and armoured  vehicles.

The key to all these decisions is setting priorities. There  will never be enough money to acquire every capability that  might be useful. We need to focus our efforts on the

capabilities which are really critical. And to do that we  need to know exactly what we are trying to achieve; we need  a clear goal. That goal is the defence of Australia.

Third, our defence policy focus on the defence of Australia  is an enduring principle which gives that policy its  stability and durability. The decision to give priority to

the defence of Australia is not the product of a passing  trend. It reflects the fundamental reality that whatever is  happening elsewhere in the world, and however rapidly that  change might take place, the one job the Australian Defence  Force must be able to do is to defend Australia.

This durability is very important. Building a defence force  is a slow business. Our major equipment programs often take  ten years to complete. The equipment itself may last for  thirty years. So the defence structure decisions we make  today will determine the shape of Australia's defence forces

forty years from now. We have a great responsibility to  make sure that our decisions today will suit not just the  world of next year, or even of the year 2000, but of 2030  and beyond.

But having now, I hope, made clear how the principle of the  defence of Australia permeates our defence planning, I want  also to explain the limits of that principle. Because those  limits are also important.

As I have explained, our policy is to build a defence force  to defend Australia, because that is the ADF's principal  role. But that does not mean that we believe the ADF has no  other role. There still lingers in our defence debate the  echos of the old debate between forward defence and fortress  Australia. But that dichotomy has been left far behind by

the development of defence technology, and of the ADF  itself.

It might once have been the case that Australian defence  policy had to make a stark choice between defending  Australia and playing a role in Australia's wider region.  That is no longer the case. The capabilities which the  Australian Defence Force has developed and is acquiring for

the defence of Australia also provide powerful capabilities  to play a role in our region of broad strategic interest and  beyond.

1 4

This ability to use the capabilities we develop for the  defence of Australia to perform other tasks further afield  has always been part of our defence policy, and was set out  explicitly in the White Paper of 1987. And it is an aspect  of our policy which we have vigorously put into practice.

With the exception of the United States, no country makes  more regular or more substantial military deployments to  South East Asia and the South West Pacific than Australia.  And beyond our own region, no country has been more willing

and more able to respond quickly and appropriately to events  further afield when we believed that Australia's interests  have required it.

I do not need to remind you that this year we accepted the  awesome responsibility of committing Australian forces to  combat for the first time since Vietnam. The RSL knows  better than any group in Australia just what that can mean.  We were proud that the Australian Defence Force had the  capability to make such a rapid, sustained and effective  contribution to the international effort in the Gulf.

We deployed ADF units again to northern Iraq for  humanitarian relief of Kurdish refugees in the aftermath of  the war, and we expect soon to send our men and women to the  Western Sahara in support of the UN settlement of a longÂ­

standing dispute there.

And with last week's successful meeting of the Cambodian  factions in Thailand, we hope that the UN-sponsored  comprehensive settlement in Cambodia, which we have worked  towards for so long, will soon be implemented. Australia  stands ready to contribute a major ADF contingent to help  make that settlement work.

So do not let anyone tell you that a defence force designed  for the defence of Australia is useless for anything else;  that it is just some kind of glorified coast guard. The  facts of recent history simply do not sustain such nonsense.

Our defence policy of self-reliance within a framework of  alliances and regional associations also provides a durable  basis for maintaining and developing our alliance with the

United States - formalised in the ANZUS Treaty which was  signed forty years ago yesterday - in the new conditions of  the post-Cold War world.  I have explained in detail  recently how we see our alliances and regional associations  developing as we work to build regional security, and how we  see the contribution which the ADF can make to that process.

For all these reasons, I believe that precisely because of  the enormous uncertainty in the world today, Australia's  defence policy must continue to focus rigourously on the  defence of Australia as the principal task of the ADF.

5. ÃÂ¯

But that does not mean that defence policy can stand still.  While we must have a clear and steady goal for our defence  planning, we must be as flexible as possible about how we  approach it. We must relentlessly seek the most efficient

way of achieving the results we need. We must not fall into  the trap of assuming that the way things have been done in  the past must always be the best way to do them in the  future. Our aim must be to get the most defence we can for  our dollar.

Earlier this year, my Defence Minister Robert Ray announced  the most comprehensive reforms to the management of  Australia's defence forces for many years. The ADF itself  has played a central role in developing these reforms; I  congratulate the CDF, General Oration, and his colleagues

for their far-sighted work.

We said at the time that these reforms have not been  undertaken to find ways to cut the defence budget.  They  have been undertaken to find ways of spending the defence

budget better. And we have proved that in last month ’  s  budget,  in which defence spending has been maintained in  real terms.

Nor have our reform efforts been limited to the defence  portfolio. Under my very able and genial Minister Ben  Humphreys,  we have been working hard to improve the services  we provide to Australia's veterans. Our key initiative has  been integration, which we believe will give veterans a  better deal. I am pleased that your largest branch, the NSW  branch, has indicated qualified support for integration, and  is looking to the Commonwealth and NSW Governments to

finalise arrangements. We will be delighted to continue to  talk about the issue with other branches,  and we hope that  they too can come to see the undoubted advantages of the  steps we are proposing.

Finally I want to close by saying specifically to the  Vietnam Veterans, who have come in recent years to be  remembered properly in this country, how glad we are to see

Long Tan Day becoming increasingly accepted as a day of  remembrance of the Vietnam War, and how much we welcome the  commencement of the Vietnam Memorial when Ben Humphreys  turns the first sod on Friday.

Mr Chairman, returning to my opening theme,  we have the  privilege and challenge of living in the time of the most  momentous change in recent history. We must all be ready to  accept that challenge. I look forward to the opportunity of  working with you as we do precisely that. I wish your  conference well.
