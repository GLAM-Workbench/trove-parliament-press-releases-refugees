TONY ABBOTT:

It’s great to be here at the Harbord Diggers for these community volunteer awards. It’s really important to  celebrate what’s best in our society and the volunteer spirit has long been something that makes Australia a  very special place. It’s not the things we do for money but the things we do for love; it’s not the things we  have to do but the things we choose to do which are the measure of us as individuals and which are the  making of our society.

Over the last couple of weeks, I’ve been travelling around Australia promoting our positive plans for a  strong and prosperous economy, for a safe and secure Australia. We are determined to build a strong  economy, should we get the chance after the election next year. We will have lower taxes, we will have  lower spending, we will have higher productivity, closer engagement with Asia and that will give us the  strong economic growth that we need to sustain the kinds of services that the Australian community has a  right to expect in the years to come. Unfortunately, we have got a government which has a spending plan but  it doesn’t have an economic plan. It has a plan to spend more money but it doesn’t have a plan to build a  stronger economy.

We’ve seen today the government crab-walking away from its commitment to deliver surpluses. This is a  government which is never ever going to deliver an honest surplus. It can’t deliver a surplus because it’s  addicted to spending and even when it tries to put in a new tax, we see the disaster of the mining tax which  was the first major new tax that anyone can remember which actually doesn’t collect any money. So, this  was a double whammy disaster: a tax that damaged investment and employment without actually collecting  any additional revenue.

One of the many reasons why this government is never going to deliver a surplus is because they can’t  control our borders. Every illegal boat that arrives costs the taxpayer some $13 million. Currently, the  Government is spending more money flying illegal boat arrivals around the country than it is subsidising the  Royal Flying Doctor Service. That’s the sorry pass we’ve come to in this country because we have a  government which is incompetent and untrustworthy.

It can be better than this. I believe it will be better than this after the next election. Australians know what a  Coalition government can do because they’ve seen a Coalition government in action.  A Coalition  government gets the Budget into surplus, it pays down debt, it produces assets. That is the kind of good  economic management which provides the kind of social dividend which Australians came to enjoy under  the Howard Government.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, can I ask you on another matter, the 2DayFM hoax call. Should the media be more regulated?

TONY ABBOTT:

This is a terrible tragedy. It’s a terrible tragedy for all involved. It was a prank that went horribly wrong. I  think all we can do is mourn and grieve for everyone involved. I think it’s important to let the dust settle  before we rush into demands for more media regulation.

QUESTION:

You made a comparison with the Flying Doctors but, I guess, is the spending that we’re doing on asylum  seekers, is it actually threatening patient care?

TONY ABBOTT:

If you spend money on preventable things, you have less money to spend on unavoidable things. Now, we  are always going to face large and growing demands for more spending on healthcare. That’s  inevitable. What we need is good management of our economy and strong management of our borders if we are  going to have the money available to spend on the kinds of services that the Australian public have a right to expect.

QUESTION:

So, are they missing out on money because it is being spent on asylum seekers?

TONY ABBOTT:

Inevitably, a dollar spent in one area is a dollar that’s not available to spend in another area.

QUESTION:

You can’t really complain too much. It’s Coalition policy to ship asylum seekers to Nauru.

TONY ABBOTT:

It’s Coalition policy to stop the boats. It’s Coalition policy to stop the boats and in government we did stop  the boats. John Howard found a problem and crafted a solution. Julia Gillard inherited a solution and created  a problem. We had something like three boats a year on average under the Howard Government; certainly  for the last five years of the Howard Government we had three boats a year on average. We are now getting  more than three boats a week. We are getting three boats a day on some days under this government.

QUESTION:

I guess given the Newspoll out today, do you think the Coalition is out of touch with young voters?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think that the Coalition has a very good story to tell voters of all ages and young people are no different to  everyone else: they want a strong and prosperous economy, they want a safe and secure Australia. Young  people are proud of their country. They are proud Australians. They appreciate what they’ve got and they  want to keep it strong and prosperous and that’s what they will get from a Coalition government.

QUESTION:

I guess, why do you think they are putting their support behind the Greens and the Labor Party, then?

TONY ABBOTT:

I dispute that that is in fact the case. I think that increasingly young people appreciate that this is an  incompetent and untrustworthy Government; that there is a better way, that there is a strong and credible  alternative and that is the Coalition.

QUESTION:

The Federal Government still wants to legislate its Malaysia Solution. I guess, will the Coalition support  that?

TONY ABBOTT:

We have always thought that the Malaysia people-swap was a dud deal for Australia as well as being a cruel  deal for boat people. We didn’t support it before. We don't support it now. We won’t support it in the future.  What we need is temporary protection visas to deny the people smugglers a product to sell. We need to have  rigorous offshore processing for all illegal boat arrivals - not just for about five per cent of them, which is  the case under Labor. We need the willingness to turn boats around where it’s safe to do so and we also very  much need to rebuild our relationship with Indonesia. A strong relationship with Indonesia is one of the keys  to stopping the boats and that’s been jeopardised by a host of decisions from this government, but most  notoriously the calamitous live cattle export ban.

QUESTION:

Your thoughts on "Kyoto 2" being signed on the weekend?

TONY ABBOTT:

We strongly support reasonable efforts to reduce emissions and are committed to the five per cent emissions  reduction target. We think it can be done domestically and we think it must be done in ways which don’t  damage our economy. Now, the problem with what the Government has apparently signed up for is that it’s  yet more spending without any reasonable guarantee of an outcome. Now, this is a government which is  much better at spending money than delivering outcomes. It’s spending money that we just don’t have. It’s  another illustration of why you will never get an honest budget surplus under the current Labor government.

QUESTION:

But what about the fact that China and, sorry, Japan and Russia and Canada have opted out of the second  protocol?

TONY ABBOTT:

That’s really a matter for them. We are determined to do what we reasonably can to reduce emissions, but  it’s got to be economically responsible as well as environmentally responsible and that’s the problem with  this government committing money that it just doesn’t have; more borrowed money for something where

there’s no guarantee of a reasonable return. This is a government which will never deliver an honest surplus  and one of the reasons why it will never deliver an honest surplus is because it is addicted to spending on  politically correct causes and we saw yet another example of that on the weekend.

Thank you.
