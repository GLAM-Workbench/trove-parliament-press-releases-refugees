ELECTORATE TALK

Last year, following a promise to the Australian community, the  Government introduced its secret ballot legislation.

In effect, the legislation simply required secret postal ballots  for electionsof senior trade union officials. The elections would  be conducted in two ways - either by the Commonwealth Electoral  Office, free of charge, or by the union itself, at its own cost.

The Government introduced this legislation because it was sick and  tired of men and women unable to have a real say in how their union  was run. Generally, the system of secret ballots is now working  well. Unions are making use of the electoral office to run their

elections. In doing so they are saving thousands of dollars in  election costs. Official figures show how well this system is  being accepted.

In the twelve months prior to August 9 last year, when the legislaÂ­ tion came into effect, there were 178 applications for officially  conducted elections. In the twelve months following that date, the  number was 244 - a 37% increase. This is an encouraging trend.  However, it is still too early to assess fully the impact of the  legislation, as many unions have not had to hold elections in the  period.

The Government believes that eventually the great majority of  organisations will have their elections officially conducted. This can only lead to a continuing strengthening of a union members  fundamental right - and that is the right to have a proper say in  how his own union is run. Unfortunately, some unions and union

leaders are not playing ball.

The Government has been advised that the Amalgamated Metal Workers  and Shipwrights Union - Australia's largest union - has sought to  conduct elections in an improper and illegal way. It is reported  that the union has tried to go back to the old star night technique  where members are lucky if 2% of them get a proper opportunity to

vote.

As a result of information that has come to the Department of  Employment and Industrial Relations, the Arbitration Inspectorate  has carried out a very detailed investigation of this matter.  *

If the Industrial Registrar confirms the breaches, there will  then be only two courses of action left. New elections will  be held - or the union will be prosecuted for breach of the law.

The Builders Labourers Federation has also sought to overturn  the purpose and spirit of the secret ballot system. The  Government has been advised that that particular union changed  its rules for election of office bearers to exclude members from  the right to stand for election.

Accordingly, Tony Street is examining further amendments to the  secret ballot legislation to make sure that the spirit of that  legislation is given effect.

We are determined that the rank and file trade unionist will  not be run over roughshod by any power seeking union official. The right of men and .women unionists will be protected.

In essence, our secret ballot legislation seeks to give unionists -  and all Australians - a better go, a fairer deal.

It is working. It is giving unionists throughout Australia a  fair chance to have their voice heard. In thousands of cases  it gives them this right for the first time.

The Government w ill make, sure that this keeps happening, that  this right is maintained - for all unionists.
