TONY ABBOTT:

I've just been meeting with, along with Joe Hockey the Shadow Treasurer, Sophie Mirabella the Shadow  Industry Minister and Andrew Robb the Shadow Finance Minister with the leaders of the automotive  industry generally, the manufacturers, the dealers, the services, the parts people, and the lease people. It is  absolutely clear that the Government's FBT changes are costing jobs now, they’re costing sales now, they're  destroying investment now, they are badly damaging an industry that is already under pressure. This is  typical of the bad policy that we get from Mr Rudd and his Government. This is very bad policy. It will  increase red tape. It will damage aspirational Australia and almost certainly it won't collect the revenue that  it's claimed because of the damage that it will do to economic activity. This is another mining tax moment  from Mr Rudd. It is further proof that this is a Prime Minister who simply doesn't understand how to run a  good and consultative government.

It is clear that this decision has ramifications far beyond those that were anticipated by the Government and  its advisers. It has ramifications in the industrial sphere because there are so many workers, perhaps  hundreds of thousands of workers, whose company vehicles impact on their enterprise bargaining  agreements. So, this is going to be at the very least a lawyer's picnic as well as an enormous hit on everyone,  an enormous tax hit on everyone who has a company vehicle. It is crystal clear that the only way to stop this  change is to change the government. We won't go ahead with this because it is bad policy. The Coalition  will never engage in the kind of policy on the run that we have seen yet again from this Government.

I'm going to ask Andrew McKellar to speak representing the various motoring organisations and then  obviously we'd take some questions.

ANDREW McKELLAR:

Thank you Tony. I'm Andrew McKellar, the executive director of the Australian Automobile Association  representing motoring groups, seven million members of motoring clubs around Australia, but motorists  more generally, but today I'm making some comments on behalf of all of the affected stakeholders who have  been impacted by this measure, that's manufacturers, that's leasing companies, that's the components  industry, that's the retailers. This is an issue which really has unified I think an entire industry and an entire

market. It is something that causes great concern and I think the impact to date is only just beginning to be  understood. It is far more wide reaching than has been suggested in what has been announced by the  Government.

Certainly, we know that it will impact many, many people through their remuneration arrangements far  more than the 320,000 that have been suggested by the Government. It is a measure which will impact in  terms of increased red tape on businesses right across the spectrum. It is impacting on sales in the industry  right now, quite severely and that is something that needs to be addressed urgently. So, we certainly  welcome the fact that the Coalition has indicated that it will strongly oppose this measure. We call on the  Government to re-think, to urgently re-think, what they have done. There is a unified coalition of  stakeholders building on this issue. They will not go away. They will take the fight up on this issue until this  policy is changed.

Thank you.

TONY ABBOTT:

Ok, do we have any questions?

QUESTION:

As far as GST, is there, if you are elected would it be too late? I mean what's the time frame of all of this?  Would it be too late for you to reverse it?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, no. This is a promise that the Government has made that it intends to implement after the election.  That is why I say that the only way to stop this is to change the government.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, are you ready for an election?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, I can certainly hear the drums beating. I expect Mr Rudd to go to the polls as soon as he possibly can  because plainly the things that Mr Rudd has been doing over the last few weeks have no real substance. His  latest plan on border protection is basically held together with blue tack and sticky tape. It’s an election fix  not a serious plan to stop the boats. Ditto, people are becoming more and more aware that his changes to the  carbon tax are just turning a $64 billion tax into a $58 billion tax. Well, I say there should be a zero dollar  tax. We should get rid of this thing altogether and his changes in respect to the Labor Party. Well, again  more fake change from the great pretender of Australian politics. What the Caucus does pre-election the  Caucus can change post-election and the one thing you can be sure about with the Labor Party is the faceless  men are always in charge.

QUESTION:

If you are elected will you dismantle that so-called PNG solution?

TONY ABBOTT:

We will obviously work very closely with our friends, we will work very closely with our friends and  neighbours as the previous Coalition did. We understand that there are a range of measures necessary if you  really are going to stop the boats, you can’t rely on any other country to do Australia’s job for it. In the end

the solution to the problems of Australia lies in Australian hands. These hands will be safe and strong when  it comes to protecting our borders.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, if you were in an asylum seekers' shoes and you and your family were fleeing a war-torn country  and you couldn't afford airfares to Australia, what would you do?

TONY ABBOTT:

I don't hold it against anyone wanting to come to Australia. Let's face it, nearly all of us are migrants or the  descendants of migrants. So, I don't hold it against anyone wanting to come to Australia. You've got to come  the right way, not the wrong way. You've got to come in through front door, not the back-door, and that's the  problem. Under this government we have subcontracted out to people smugglers an important component of  our immigration program. We have been taken for a ride for too long by the people smugglers. This  government has effectively surrendered for five years to the people smugglers and now after five years of  abject failure, Kevin Rudd wants to be rewarded because he says, I have a new plan. Well, this plan won't  work just like all of his other plans won't work because Mr Rudd and the Labor Party don't have the will and  the resolve to protect our borders.

QUESTION:

If you had to flee you might have to come in through the back door. If you had to flee you might not have  the option of the front door, what would you do?

TONY ABBOTT:

The overwhelming majority of the people who are coming to our country illegally by boat have come via  other countries where they could readily have claimed asylum. The fact that they are determined not to stop  until they come to Australia means that they are overwhelmingly economic migrants, not genuine asylum  seekers and this is the point that it has taken this government five years to understand. The Coalition has  always understood this. This is why when it comes to who you can trust on border protection, you can trust  the people who have always been strong on border protection, not a Prime Minister who one day says he's  not going to lurch to the right on border protection and the next day says he's not going to lurch to the left on  border protection. The trouble is Kevin Rudd will be whatever he needs to be to try to win a political  advantage.

QUESTION:

What is your solution to the problem?

TONY ABBOTT:

Our solution today is the same as it's always been. It is to put in place the policies that have been proven to  work and there are a number of elements to those policies. First of all, we've got to have temporary  protection visas so the people smugglers don't have a product to sell. Second, we've got to have rigorous  offshore processing and that's why the Coalition has always been ready to work with Nauru and PNG and  other friendly countries. Third and absolutely vitally, we've got to be prepared to turn boats around where it  is safe to do so. They are our borders and we have to be prepared to do what is necessary on our borders to  keep our country safe and secure.

QUESTION:

On turning the boats around, most of them are in such a condition that they wouldn't make it and you could  be actually condemning people to death. So how you can say turn the boats around it is not an easy thing to  do, is it?

TONY ABBOTT:

No-one said it was easy, but I completely reject claims that it is impossible. It has been done before. It can  be done again. A whole range of military and naval experts, Admiral Ritchie, Brigadier Hogan, General  Molan have all stood up to testify in recent days that what has been done in the past can be done again. Sure,  it is not easy, but again it comes down to, do you have the will to protect our country or in the end do you  think that the protection of our country can be subcontracted out to others? Well, it can't be. In the end, no-one will have Australia's interests more at heart than Australians and no-one is going to be more determined  to protect our country than the Australian Government. And no-one should be more determined to protect  our country than the Australian Government and the Australian Prime Minister.

QUESTION:

So therefore, if you are elected, because you don't seem to be too keen on the Papua New Guinea idea,  would you scrap that idea?

TONY ABBOTT:

I'm only too happy to work with PNG, as indeed, the former Coalition Government did. Let's face it, Manus  Island was part of the Pacific Solution which Mr Rudd so exuberantly scrapped back in August of 2008. So  I'm only too happy to work with PNG. The trouble is this particular deal is unravelling before our very eyes.  It is not legally binding and it doesn't say what Mr Rudd says it said. It doesn't say that everyone who comes  to Australia illegally by boat will go to PNG and it doesn't say that no-one who goes to PNG will ever come  to Australia. So Mr Rudd is being misleading to the point of dishonesty and that's the problem. You can  never trust what Mr Rudd says because what Mr Rudd says today is totally different from what he said  yesterday and it will be totally different from what he says tomorrow.
