Ballarat and Bendigo Showcase Multicultural Initiatives

The Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, Gary Hardgrave, visited Ballarat and  Bendigo today, to highlight the importance of diversity and multicultural affairs in regional  Australia.

'Australia's regional centres continue to welcome migrants and refugees into their  communities, and embrace the benefits of diversity,' Mr Hardgrave said.

Approximately 10 per cent of the population of the Central Highlands and Grampians region  were born overseas.

'The diversity of cultures continues to enrich the community and is an asset for the region,'  the Minister said.

While in Ballarat and Bendigo, the Minister met with local government officials, and industry  and community representatives to discuss multicultural issues.

'It is fantastic to see both communities focusing on the important issues surrounding  multicultural affairs,' Mr Hardgrave said.

Mr Hardgrave conferred Australian citizenship on 13 candidates in Ballarat this morning and  11 candidates in Bendigo this afternoon.

'The candidates from China, England, India, the Philippines, South Africa, Vietnam,  Zimbabwe, Malaysia, New Zealand, Scotland and Sri Lanka represent the success of the  Federal Government's regional migration initiatives,' Mr Hardgrave said.

The Minister said that government policy sought to influence the decisions of migrants about  where they lived in an effort to improve the movement of migrants away from cities into  regional areas to meet skill shortages.

Mr Hardgrave also met with the Ballarat Regional Multicultural Council and toured the New  Bendigo Gold project.
