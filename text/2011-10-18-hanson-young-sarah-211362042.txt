UNHCR report puts Australia’s asylum  seeker numbers into perspective: Greens



The UNHCR’S last Asylum Levels and Trends in Industrialized Countries First Half 2011  report shows what a lack of perspective our political leaders have about the small number of  people who reach Australia seeking asylum, the Australian Greens said today.

“By comparison with other countries, we are in no way being ‘flooded’ by asylum seekers,”  Greens’ immigration spokesperson, Sen. Sarah Hanson-Young, said.

“These figures should be a reminder that as a signatory to the Refugee Convention, Australia  has obligations to treat these desperate people with dignity and care.

“Other countries which have far greater numbers of asylum seekers arriving each month, such  as Italy, do not use the cruel and degrading practice of indefinite and mandatory detention and  off-shore assessments, which are not a deterrent.



“With facts and figures like these, the Prime Minister and Opposition Leader need to stop  playing politics with asylum seekers, and cease taking Australians as fools.”
