LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION  THE HON. TONY ABBOTT MHR  FEDERAL MEMBER FOR WARRINGAH

13 May 2011

TRANSCRIPT OF THE HON. TONY ABBOTT MHR,  INTERVIEW WITH SABRA LANE  AM PROGRAMME, ABC

Subjects: Budget 2011.

E&OE……………………….…………………………………………………………………

SABRA LANE:

Mr Abbott, good morning and welcome.

TONY ABBOTT:

`Morning, Sabra.

SABRA LANE:

The Finance Minister Penny Wong says that your budget reply shows you are all opposition and no leader.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I think that the Prime Minister has demonstrated this week that she’s an alternative Opposition Leader,  not a fair dinkum Prime Minister. Look, this is budget week. It’s the week for the Government to tell us  what it’s going to do for the country and all we got from the Government this week was more pain for  families and a surplus, perhaps, in 2012-13 which is not based on economic reform here but which is based  on economic growth in China. So, if we get there it’s a surplus made in China, not made in Australia.

SABRA LANE:

I closed my eyes listening to your budget reply speech last night and it sounded like I was transported back  to August last year in a campaign speech. The transcript even had a 2010 date on it.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, the thing is that my task last night was to talk to all the people who Labor has forgotten. I mean,  Labor’s working families of 2007 have become the forgotten families of 2011 and I wanted to reach out to  them last night and to say to them that the Coalition hasn’t forgotten them and what we have in mind for  Australia - should we get the chance - is affordable, it’s understandable, it’s deliverable, it’s responsible and

we can have more responsible government, more responsible institutions and more productive people and  that’s what I outlined last night, Sabra.

SABRA LANE:

You announced one new initiative last night. The rest of it restated Coalition policy from the last election  and the one policy that you announced that you say is new, some people say that’s pretty generous to  describe it as new because every party promises to reduce red tape for business.

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, this is an initiative which has been working well in Victoria since 2006. It was actually introduced by  the Victorian Labor Government. The BCA and the Victorian Employers Chamber of Commerce and  Industry say that it’s a very good programme. Victoria is the state which has the best record for low and less  regulation and the idea is that each government department will be given a target to reduce the cost of  regulation to departmental clients and they go through regulation by regulation and they are required to  come up with reductions in costs to the people that they are impacting upon. So, it’s a way of making the  public servants conscious of the fact that their ‘you beaut’ decisions actually have to be paid for by  someone. They do have costs, the costs have got to be thought of and we’ve got to try to get the costs down.

SABRA LANE:

Ok. But you say that the budget is tantamount to a war on Australia’s middle class but you’ve not said what  measures you are going to oppose. Do we assume you are going to block everything?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, when these measures come before the parliament we will obviously have our response in the  parliament and we will not just…

SABRA LANE:

These measures affect about two per cent of Australian families.

TONY ABBOTT:

The point I make, it’s very clear Sabra, if you want to make it easier for families to pay their bills, you don’t  go ahead with the big new taxes, the carbon tax in particular and if you want to make it easier for people to  make their mortgage repayments, you cut government spending because that will take the pressure off  interest rate payments and look, you know, whether it’s the National Broadband Network, whether it’s the  border protection blowouts, whether it’s this new programme to give pensioners set top boxes at twice the  price that Gerry Harvey will do it, whether it be spending $70,000 to bring asylum seekers from Malaysia to  Australia and take them from Australia to Malaysia, $70,000 each, when a first class air ticket costs about  $7,000. I mean, this is a government which is riddled with waste and we’ve got to get it under control.

SABRA LANE:

But this was a budget reply. Aren’t Australian families entitled to hear your alternatives. Or are you treating  them with contempt?

TONY ABBOTT:

Oh, look, Sabra, please. Let’s not get government spin on the ABC. This is…

SABRA LANE:

It’s not government spin. It’s a budget reply, Tony Abbott.

TONY ABBOTT:

This is government spin, Sabra. Now Sabra, I challenge people to read the funereal dirge from Wayne Swan  and to read my budget reply and make a judgement about who has a vision for Australia. That was what was  on display last night, an alternative vision for Australia, a clear direction for our country.

SABRA LANE:

You talked about forgotten families last night, a nod to the famous Menzies speech about the forgotten  people. This is an overture to win back the Howard battlers you didn’t win back last time?

TONY ABBOTT:

And what’s wrong with reaching out to the police, the teachers, the shop assistants, the manufacturing  workers, the miners of our country? I mean, these are the people who this Government says are super rich  and don’t deserve any help from government. Now, I mean, sure, they might be doing better than some, but  they are doing better than some because of hard work. What’s wrong with aspiration? I want to reward and  encourage aspiration. This Government’s sour and miserable about aspiration.

SABRA LANE:

You challenged the Prime Minister last night to call an election once she decides the final details of her  carbon tax...

TONY ABBOTT:

Or once Bob Brown tells her what the final details ought to be…

SABRA LANE:

The multi-party committee comprised of Tony Windsor, you warn the nation would slide into a morass of  indecision and paralysis if it continues for another two years. The parliament is operating pretty well,  legislation is getting passed and the independents appear to be quite happy with what they are getting. I  mean, isn’t the risk that you are waiting another two and a half years before that election is called?

TONY ABBOTT:

The point I am making, Sabra, is that this is a Prime Minister who went to the last election with this solemn  pledge: ‘there will be no carbon tax under the government I lead’. It would be utterly unconscionable for this  Prime Minister and this parliament to try to introduce a carbon tax, given that 144 of the 150 members of the  Reps went to the election solemnly committed to not having a carbon tax. Now, if she’s fair dinkum about  this carbon tax, she should finalise the details with Senator Brown and then go to an election on the basis of  those details, seek a mandate for what she wants. It would be a travesty of democracy, an absolute disgrace  it would be. I mean, if anything is going to jeopardise people’s faith in Australian democracy it would be a  parliament doing what 144 of its members pledged they would not do.

SABRA LANE:

You re-announced last night a plan for a one year mandatory jail term for people smugglers but the  Government says you’re proposing to actually weaken the existing laws.

TONY ABBOTT:

No, wrong. Not true.

SABRA LANE:

People smugglers face 20 years behind bars at the moment and a mandatory minimum penalty of five  years…

TONY ABBOTT:

That’s for aggravated people smuggling.

SABRA LANE:

…if they’re found guilty of smuggling five people.

TONY ABBOTT:

Aggravated smuggling but for simple people smuggling there is no mandatory minimum. So, I’m saying  there should be a mandatory minimum, even for simple people smuggling and for repeat offenders there  should be a mandatory minimum of ten years.

SABRA LANE:

So, you deny that you’re weakening what…

TONY ABBOTT:

No, course I’m not. I mean, self-evidently I’m not and you’re not accusing me, are you?

SABRA LANE:

I’ve said it was the Government.

TONY ABBOTT:

Ok, alright.

SABRA LANE:

Last year, the Opposition tried to nominate savings in its budget reply. You deferred to Joe Hockey, Joe  Hockey deferred to Andrew Robb and we had that now infamous press conference where a minder was up  the back winding up Andrew Robb because it became so embarrassing. One of the reasons why you’re not  putting forward costings now, you want to avoid that kind of debacle again?

TONY ABBOTT:

No, I’m going to do exactly what we did last time. That is, we made clear our attitude to specific at the time  those measures came into the parliament. That’s the appropriate thing to do. We’re not going to dance to the  Government’s tune, we’re not going to run on the Government’s timetable and in good time, Sabra, before  the next election there will be a consolidated list of savings and spending proposals so everyone can be  crystal clear about how much better the fiscal position will be under the Coalition.

SABRA LANE:

Ok. I need to ask you about the private members bill that you had on Wild Rivers to wind back the  Queensland Government’s bill. Isn’t your bill effectively dead now that Family First Senator Steve Fielding  says he’s withdrawn his support?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I would like Steve to talk to Noel Pearson before he comes to a final view.

SABRA LANE:

Well, he describes this, Noel Pearson describes him as Judas.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, there’s a lot of tough talk that gets bandied around in public debate but I have time for Steve Fielding.  I think he’s a decent bloke. I think he wants to do the right thing by the Aboriginal people of Cape York and  rather than trade a tax over the microphone I think if Noel and Steve were to sit down and have a face-to-face, and I understand that Steve sat down and had a face-to-face meeting with some of the opponents of the  legislation, I think he owes it to the parliament and to the country to sit down and have a face-to-face  meeting with some of the supporters of the legislation.

SABRA LANE:

Ok Mr Abbott, thanks for your time this morning.

TONY ABBOTT:

Thanks, Sabra.
