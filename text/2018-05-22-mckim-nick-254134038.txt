Media Release: Death on Manus Island

May 22, 2018



The death of a Rohingyan refugee who was in Australia’s care on Manus Island is another preventable tragedy that is a  direct result of the bipartisan policy of cruelty, Greens Immigration Senator Nick McKim says.

“This man sought Australia’s help, and suffered years of deprivation for daring to ask,” Senator McKim said.

“His death is a direct result of political decisions of the Labor and Liberal parties.”

“He faced the impossible choice of indefinite detention, or returning to face ethnic cleansing in Myanmar.”

“This is a humanitarian crisis. The men, women and children detained on Manus Island and Nauru must be evacuated  to Australia now.”

“How many deaths must occur before the Liberals and Labor change their minds?”
