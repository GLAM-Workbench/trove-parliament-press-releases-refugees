SUBJECTS: 2001-02 Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook

TREASURER:

Today the Minister for Finance and I are releasing a Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook which incorporates the Treasury's best forecasts for the Australian economy in the current and in future years.

The forecast has been revised down somewhat from the Budget forecast of 3 ¼ per cent growth through the 2001-02 year to 3 per cent growth through the 2001-02 year. Principally it has been revised down because of the world situation. We noted downside risks at the time of the May Budget. Most of those have been realised and in addition we have had the terrible terrorist attacks of the 11 th September which has given a great deal more uncertainty to the world economic outlook.

In fact the cumulative growth of our major trading partners, Australia's major trading partners, through 2001, 2002 is expected to be the weakest two years in the last thirty years, the last three decades.

Counteracting the serious world economic downturn has been a strengthening of domestic demand in the Australian economy, principally arising from low interest rates and the housing cycle which has been much stronger than expected at Budget time. Accordingly we have revised up domestic demand since Budget time from 3 to 3.75 per cent.

So what has essentially happened here is that the world has turned down more seriously than was expected in May. In particular, with the shocks of the 11th September, our major trading partners are now in the weakest position they've been in for three decades, but Australia has shown considerable resilience and in fact domestic demand has strengthened, not completely offsetting the effect of those world economic developments but counteracting the full effect of them. And at a 3 per cent growth rate in 2001-02, Australia will be growing faster than any of the G7 countries such as the United States, Japan, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Italy, Canada and faster than the region, most of the region and most of the other countries of the world.

The effect of the downward revision on growth has had some effect on the Budget bottom line which is now forecast in the current financial year to be a cash surplus of about $500 million and cash surpluses are forecast across the forward estimates with next year around about $1.1 billion, $1 billion, slightly down from the $1.1 billion forecast at Budget time.

The bottom line has been affected principally by two factors. Revenues

have been revised up somewhat and a cash reconciliation of this appears in the table on page 21. Revenues have been revised up by a total of about $0.6 billion. Principally that is an outcome of a better than expected bottom, better than expected final Budget outcome in the year just past. So we're starting off a higher base. Expenses have been revised up by about $1.6 billion, about $1.1 billion of that is parameters. And the parameters that have changed in particular are higher payments on pensions as a result of an increase in wages, pensions are now set to 25 per cent of male total average weekly earnings so as they go up, pensions go up, a very large increase in payments to the States under the Budget balancing assistance up about $615 million. Principally that results from higher CPI. The Commonwealth guarantees to the States a guaranteed minimum amount which is indexed to inflation so that as that goes up, the amounts to the States go up, higher family tax benefits of about $300 million, that is families taking their benefits through the expense side. Correspondingly there has been additional revenues because they have not been taking as much through the tax side, so that appears on both sides of the ledger. And additional policy decisions which in total amount to about $0.5 billion, the largest of those are additional expenses in the running of the Australian Tax Office, as a consequence of higher than forecast business registrations, an additional $103 million that the Government has allocated this year for the processing of unauthorised boat arrivals. Now I want to make this clear. That is not the total amount that we spend on processing unauthorised boat arrivals. That is the additional amount since Budget time that we have set aside for the processing of unauthorised boat arrivals, $103 million, the $52 million already paid out in relation to recovery of Ansett services to rural Australia, $64 million on Royal Commissions such as HIH and the Building Royal Commission.

So the cash position in relation to 2001-02, is, revenue is up by about $0.6 billion, cash expenses up by about $1.6 billion, most of that in parameters, about $1.1 billion of that, and the remainder about $0.5 billion in relation to policy.

What this represents is an underlying cash surplus for the fifth consecutive year and underlying cash surpluses forecast across the forward estimates. As a result of the last five Budgets we have now repaid something like $57 billion of Labor debt and we are forecasting by the end of the financial year that we will have repaid $60 billion of Labor Party debt since the Government was elected. That $60 billion of Labor Party debt that has now been repaid is giving the Budget bottom line the current benefit of about $4 or 5 billion, that is the saving in interest costs that the Government makes as a result of the repayment of $60 billion worth of debt.

I would not underestimate the international challenges. As I have said earlier, in 2001, 2002, growth in our major trading partners will be over

those two years, the lowest in thirty years. And so the international environment is a very difficult and very challenging environment. In Australia we have been insulated against that somewhat by low interest rates, by additional income tax cuts which has kept consumer demand strong and now, particularly by the First Home Owners Scheme and the strong housing construction. But this respresents the best estimates that the Treasury can put on the current situation and I believe the best estimates that can be laid down in relation to Australia in the current time.

JOURNALIST:

Treasurer why is there such a slender surplus given that you're taking a record take of taxation as a percentage of GDP, a sign of your economic management?

TREASURER:

The Commonwealth of course has cut tax to GDP, as you can see in relation to the historical tables, the revenue to GDP, the tax revenue to GDP in 2001-02 will be about 21.2 per cent. Now you have to be very careful comparing these figures because we have changed to accruals. But compared to about 23 per cent when the Government was elected.

JOURNALIST:

Does that include the GST?

TREASURER:

That excludes the GST. When you add GST in and you take away revenue replacements, and you take away the effect of the family tax benefits, as I have written, the tax to GDP ratio is lower and falling.

JOURNALIST:

Why won't this surplus that you predict for this year disappear ... (inaudible)

TREASURER:

Because one of the decisions which is already factored into this Government, into this Budget is the largest build up in military expenses we have ever had in Australia. One of the reasons that the Government produced the White Paper with an additional, I think it was $23 billion over 10 years, was we foresaw the need for additional military equipment and we foresaw the need for additional build up in our defence forces. And from time to time you hear Mr Beazley say, oh well the Government has spent too much money over the last year. The two big decisions which the Government took in the last year which affected the Budget, was one, a defence build up. And if he says we have spent too much money, I would like him to tell us that he thinks we should be spending less on defence.

And the second very large financial decision that we took in the last year was to abolish petrol excise indexation. So if he wants to complain about that, I would like to hear him announce a policy to restore petrol indexation.

JOURNALIST:

Just on that point Treasurer surely you're not suggesting that the deployment which the Prime Minister announced an hour ago will not involve an extra cost to the Budget or are you suggesting that those costs will be absorbed within the existing Defence role?

TREASURER:

Well Paul, it depends of course how long the commitment goes on, and it depends of course the nature of the particular commitment. But in terms of funding the fighter force, the surveilllance force, the ships and the troops, that is all factored into the Budget. Right. Now if there are additional requests we would look at those at the time. But in terms of factoring all of the military hardware and the hours and wages and all of that, that is factored into this Budget.

JOURNALIST:

Is there anything not factored into it?

TREASURER:

Well, there could be events which we have not forseen. All I am saying is the forseeable events in relation to the operation of the hardware and the wages and the salaries and the deployment costs are put in relation to this Budget. Now we don't know how long this will go on. I must say to you, that the request from the United States President which was made last night, and the activation that the Prime Minister announced this morning means that it is very early days. But in relation to the deployment of the military hardware and the salaries and so on, the basic costs, that is factored in to this Budget.

JOURNALIST:

Is that commitment that was expanded overnight, has that been factored in overnight (inaudible)?

TREASURER:

No I am not. I am saying nothing has been factored in overnight. I am saying the decision that was made overnight obviously isn't factored into these figures. These figures have been produced over a period of months. So if there are unforeseen events which is in addition to the operation of the military hardware and the payment of the salaries, there could be

additional costs. But in relation to the deployment of the equipment, the payment of the salaries, the wages and so on, that is factored into this Budget. Obviously if this were to draw on for a very long period of time or if it were to involve other non forseen matters that will be a cost to the Budget.

JOURNALIST:

Surely you can't bring forward these figures with any credibility given that we've made this deployment to the war on terrorism and it is open ended?

TREASURER:

Well Paul, these are the best figures that can be produced as at the present time, taking into account all revenues and all expenses. You can't do a Budget on a minute by minute basis. You can't have a Budget which is good at 10.01 and changes by 10.02 and changes by 10.03, you have got to be reasonable about these things. What I am saying to you, is factored into this Budget in additional to base defence expenditures, is the largest military funding build up in Australia's peacetime history. The largest military funding build up in Australia's peacetime history which will cover as I said in relation to defence equipment and defence personnel, all of those costs. Now if there are additional matters as time goes by, we will bring them to account. But you can't bring those unforseen or additional matters to account now. And I freely say to you that we havenÃ¯Â¿Â½t tried to do that between midnight of last night and this morning.

JOURNALIST:

Do you have some rule of thumb which tells you per week the additional costs of having soldiers in the field of Afghanistan or wherever as distinct from having them in Townsville?

MINISTER FOR FINANCE AND ADMINISTRATION:

Well it is to a large extent with a Budget as large as DefenceÃ¯Â¿Â½s is, capable of being absorbed for a period. The Treasurer has made that very clear, that as at this point in time, the broad expenses of Defence whether they be in Townsville or somewhere in the Middle East is covered by a fairly large Budget. And remember that Budget is not being touched since 1996. It has built up year after year and it has been given a huge injection through the White Paper proposal over the past year or so. But again, as the Treasurer has made very, very clear, that as this particular event goes on clearly there is a need at some point, I don't know when, at some point, to perhaps re-evaulate it. But for the moment, the broad expenses of this particular decision are covered.

JOURNALIST:



Given the uncertainties, if you are still Treasurer, will you bring down another updated Budget statement in December or January?

TREASURER:

I doubt that it would be needed. Because this is the best, this is about what, we brought down our Budget in May, we are now in October, that is five months after it, by December we will be working on next year's Budget. If there were any huge unforseen event, if there were for example another terrorist attack which was obviously going to have an effect on the world economy, we might consider that then, but within the knowledge of what we currently have, I think this will be the best estimate that can be laid down and by December of this year I will probably be working on next year's Budget. We will be putting it into that.

JOURNALIST:

(inaudible)

TREASURER:

Oh yes. This is the fifth surplus that the Government has delivered. I think in every one of our, every one of the Budgets I have done, the Budget outcome has always been better than forecast at Mid Year Review. I think in relation to the last Budget Outcome, at the Mid Year I forecast an outcome of $2 billion surplus and we came in at about $5.3. That is because we have never sought to gild the lily. We have always sought to be conservative in our assumptions and this is done on conservative assumptions. But I think they are the most robust assumptions that can be put in place.

JOURNALIST:

If costs do blow out on the military front, given your penchant for surpluses is the best way to deal with that some kind of war tax a la the Timor Levy?

TREASURER:

Can I just say in relation to the Timor Levy. There is a lot of talk that goes on about the Timor Levy. Can I make this point? There was no Timor Levy, not for one day. And it, well it was, when Australia engaged in its involvement in East Timor, a lot of journalists, quite rightly said, this is going to cost an enormous amount of money and we thought at the time that it would. And we said that if that was the case we would have a levy. As it turned out, the nature of that involvement was more than adequately covered by our defence Budget. This is why you have defence Budgets. The $13 billion defence Budget, to maintain troops and aircraft and navies with a $23 billion build up. Now because that was maintained within the



then defence Budget we did not impose a Timor Levy, not for a day, there was no Timor Levy. It became a bit of an urban myth that Timor Levy and you know from time to time I hear people talking about it. Now in relation to this defence expenditure, I can say, within the $13 billion Budget for defence with the $23 billion add-on over and above the real increase, over 10 years we will be able to rebuild our defence forces. Now you say to me, what happens if there is something unforseen in Afghanistan, if there is, we will look at that at the time. I think it would be wrong to try and think of every worst possibility now. But I don't believe to fund Australia's defence forces in terms of Orion aircraft, in terms of naval ships, in terms of the SAS and in terms of the Hornets and fighters, you need supplementation to the existing defence Budget.

JOURNALIST:

Would you rather have a tax, in that situation as opposed to letting the Budget go into deficit?

TREASURER:

We won't need a tax. We won't need a tax. But I will make this point. If there is anybody that wants to rollback the existing revenue base, they will. The rollback of the existing revenue base will require other taxes to be put up. Now that only stands to reason. Because the introduction of GST enabled other taxes to come down. Rolling it back means they go back up again. So whether they put them up in income tax or capital gains tax or company taxes, that is for our opponents to name. But whilst you have a robust indirect tax base of the current broad dimension, then you can have those lower income taxes, and capital gains taxes, and company taxes.

JOURNALIST:

Treasurer, what, so income tax cuts are off for the next three years?

TREASURER:

Well, I said earlier it wouldnÃ¯Â¿Â½t be prudent to cut tax in this year, and the reason I said that was that the first call on resources in this year ought to be expenses in relation to unauthorised boat arrivals, Ansett, in relation to Defence matters. But you have a look at the forward estimates, you will see that they build in subsequent years so if that were the case, people ...

JOURNALIST:

(Inaudible) ... government ... (inaudible)?

TREASURER:

Well, if you want to know about the next term of government ask me about the next term of government. I'm not answering about the next term of

government until we win this one.

JOURNALIST:

Next year or the year after there is precious little on the surface you can play with with tax cuts. 0.2 per cent of GDP to 2003-04 is a fair way out ...

TREASURER:

Sure.

JOURNALIST:

... will you be announcing any?

TREASURER:

Well, if we have got an announcement to make I'm sure it will be made at the time.

JOURNALIST:

Can I ask a question (inaudible), it would be prudent for Labor to do anything at all on the tax front given the size of these surpluses?

TREASURER:

Yes, I think Labor could abolish GST. Labor could easily abolish the GST. There is no problem in abolishing the GST, all you have got to do, is re-introduce wholesale sales tax and hike income tax. This argument that Mr Beazley goes on about, he says I can't abolish the GST, of course you can abolish the GST. Abolishing the GST is revenue neutral as long as you introduce a wholesale sales tax, re-introduce Financial Institutions Duty, bring back the excise of petrol and put everybody who is currently on a 30 per cent marginal income tax rate back on 43, which is what he considers to be a better tax system. The reason why Mr Beazley is now backing off his rollback policy, is that he doesn't have the stomach for it. It is not any financial problem. You can take 50 per cent out of the GST. If he were really honest he would take 100 per cent of the GST away. But the reason he is backing off is he doesn't have the stomach for it. He knows what we all know - that it was much better to put the tax base on a broad indirect tax base so you could lower income taxes and capital gains taxes. His argument was always a fraud. The essential fraud of the Labor Party, all through this debate was that they were opposed to the GST, but never had a plan to remove it.

JOURNALIST:

Treasurer, (inaudible) this point about the surplus? Are you saying, are you giving a guarantee that there will be a surplus, and that you will do whatever it takes to keep that surplus?

TREASURER:

We are giving a guarantee that we will keep the Budget in surplus, yes we are. We put the Budget into surplus when it was $10 billion in deficit, and then we repaid $60 billion worth of debt, and having put it into surplus, we intend to keep it there, yes.

JOURNALIST:

Well if you don't raise taxes that means you have to cut spending somewhere ...?

TREASURER:

No. It means ...

JOURNALIST:

... and these defence expenditures do blow out.

TREASURER:

It doesn't mean that. It means that we have to make sure that we don't increase expenses, and we keep expenses as they are currently forecast. That is what it means.

JOURNALIST:

Your forecast says unemployment at 7 per cent. How high above 7 will it go to make that (inaudible)?

TREASURER:

Well, the Budget number was 7 per cent year average, which meant at Budget time we thought it would sort of, you know, vary down and vary up. As it turns out, it has been a little better than expected. It is still at 6.7 per cent. But can I say in relation to unemployment figures ...

JOURNALIST:

You forecast them for 7 (inaudible) ...

TREASURER:

... yes, yes, and if it stayed at 6.7 we would report that as 6 ¾ rather than 7. At the moment we are beating our forecasts. Now, I was just going to say in relation to unemployment, anybody who looks at the labour force figures sees that it is a saw-tooth, you know, they report one month that 50,000 jobs have been created and they report the next month that 50,000 jobs have been lost. I have never, I have always made this point in relation to the labour force, I do not regard the seasonally adjusted, month by

month figures as particularly accurate, because if you go back they have been incredibly saw-toothed. The only thing you can say about the labour force figures is that over a period of time you get a view as to where they are. My view is, that the unemployment rate is now a shade under 7 but, you know, if it is 6.87 you report it as 6 ¾, and if it is 6.88 you report it as 7. That is the way you report these things. And ... somebody's leaned on the (lights) ... you better turn them on again.

JOURNALIST:

Mr Fahey, what year have you factored in the sale of Sydney Airport?

TREASURER:

Hang on.

JOURNALIST:

I thought you were worried (inaudible)?

TREASURER:

No, I'm not worried, I'm just trying to get the lights back on.

MINISTER FOR FINANCE AND ADMINISTRATION:

The sale of Sydney Airport ...

TREASURER:

Can I just finish this point. I'll just finish this point. But the labour force is a little under 7 at the moment and we think it will be a little under 7, around 7 over the course of the year. And, it is a false precision to actually try and be more accurate than that. We think it will be where it is, around the 7 mark or a touch under. Sorry, John.

MINISTER FOR FINANCE AND ADMINISTRATION:

The sale of Sydney Airport, what year has it been factored in, I think was the question. Look the announcement that was made there about a month ago, indicated that we would not be proceeding with the sale of Sydney Airport until early in calendar year 2002. So, what that has meant is, there has been a minor variation in the public debt interest savings. It was anticipated initially that the sale would be completed this calendar year, it is now anticipated in the early part of 2002 and that is what has been factored in.

JOURNALIST:

Mr Costello, your Government introduced the Charter of Budget Honesty and said it was very important to have a non-partisan statement on the state of the books. How is it anything other than a bit cheeky for you to put

these figures out here early today and gazump your own Charter of Budget Honesty?

TREASURER:

What the Charter of Budget Honesty means, is, if I tried to put out figures today that the Treasury didn't agree with, I would be caught out tomorrow. And that is ...

JOURNALIST:

Why did you need to do it today?

TREASURER:

... well, I'll come to that in a moment. That is what gives people the assurance that nobody will ever try and do again, what Mr Beazley did in the Ã¯Â¿Â½96 campaign. I'll just go over the history of this because I think that it is important that it is understood.

JOURNALIST:

(Inaudible).

TREASURER:

Well, Tim, there are others that don't understand these things as well as you. In the Ã¯Â¿Â½96 campaign that was the Mid-Year Review. That was it. That is what a Mid-Year Review looks like today ...

JOURNALIST:

You probably don't need a whole history lecture, we probably just need (inaudible).

TREASURER:

... and it was false because what it said was that the Budget was in surplus when it was actually $10,000 million in the red. And so what I said, was that we would have a statement from the independent officials so that nobody could ever do that again. So, if I brought out a statement like that, that was wrong, I would get caught tomorrow. So why do I bring out a statement like that? I brought out a statement like that, because it contains much more detail. It contains measures documents and it contains all the reconciliations to both sets of accounting standards which ...

JOURNALIST:

Why did you do it the day before the other statement?

TREASURER:

... which you wouldn't get in relation to that. And I knew if that came out, than you would all want me to produce a Mid-Year Review which showed you the measures and the reconciliations anyway. So, what we have done is we have put out as much information as is available. You have the Charter which comes out tomorrow which gives you the guarantee that that will be accurate.

JOURNALIST:

The Charter also provides for the Government to submit its election promises for costing by Treasury and Finance. Will you be doing that?

TREASURER:

Well, they have been, most of them have been costed already. The costings that we put out in relation to these are the Treasury and Finance costings.

JOURNALIST:

(Inaudible).

TREASURER:

Sorry.

JOURNALIST:

It incorporates Government commitments up to what (inaudible)?

TREASURER:

This incorporates Government commitments up until the issue of the writs. All decisions that were made by the Government up until the issue of the writs, when we went into caretaker mode. Sorry, last question.

JOURNALIST:

How much of that initial spending do you expect, on boat people, do you expect to be sustained over coming years or (inaudible)?

TREASURER:

In the Budget, we actually make provision for the processing of unauthorised arrivals. In this year, I think, we made provision for 5,500, so you have got an allocation, I forget how much it is, it is a couple of hundred million, each year, built in. It is over and above that, that the $103 million is. In future years we believe that the measure we are taking, will mean that the number of boat arrivals will come back to budget or, as I hope, be less. And if they are less, that will produce savings in future years. Now we haven't factored any of those savings in, but if the message gets back to the smugglers, that this pipeline is no longer open, and there is no point in sailing out of Indonesia, then the numbers would decline and

you would actually get savings in forward years. So we haven't factored in, in forward years, additional costs, nor have we factored in, in forward years savings. We have just left the Budget figures where they are.

Thank you all very much. Thanks.
