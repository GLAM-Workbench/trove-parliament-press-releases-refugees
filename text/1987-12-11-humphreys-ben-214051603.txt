News ReleaseBen H umphreys m in ister for veterans' affairsSYDNEY .  DECEMBER 11, 1987SAFETY NET MILESTONEAustralia's reputation for having many types of medicines available to everyone, including the poor and the chronically sick, was aptly demonstrated in a simple ceremony in Sydney today.Veterans' Affairs Minister Ben Humphreys, who is responsible for the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, today presented the half-millionth Safety Net entitlement card to Valery Pattak, at a pharmacy in Sydney's Bondi Junction.Australia is one of comparatively few countries which provide free or subsidised pharmaceuticals to people who need long-term medicines."People with chronic complaints such as arthritis save hundreds of dollars a year through this Safety Net Scheme," Mr Humphreys said. .The Safety Net scheme entitles families who have used 25 prescriptions for listed pharmaceuticals to free pharmaceutical benefits items for the remainder of the calendar year.Australia 1788-1988 0 0 3 3 3 0

75-year old Valery Pattak holds the half-millionth Safety Net

card, and there are another million Australians who qualify

because the card covers not just individuals, but entire

families.

"The most commonly supplied drugs under Safety Net are for the

treatment of high blood pressure, asthma, and arthritis," Mr

Humphreys said.

Families who have several members suffering from a chronic

complaint, or those with children who are regularly sick, benefit

most under the scheme.

"The Government is committed to easing the financial burden

for people who suffer these often debilitating and painful

chronic conditions," Mr Humphreys said.

The Federal Member for Phillip, Jannette McHugh, who is chairman

of the Caucus Community Services and Welfare committee, attended

today's ceremony.

Under the Safety Net Scheme the Government will provide medicines

costing an estimated $139 million this financial year.

"I am sure Australian taxpayers support the use of their money to

help the sick this way," Mr Humphreys said.

MEDIA RELEASE THE SENATE 10 December 1987

PR: 87/440

Democrat Response to Government Higher Education Green Paper

Narrow and short-sighted views on the role of higher education could

be imposed by the Government through its proposal that 'educational

profiles' be developed and used as a basis of funding for each

institution, the Deputy Leader of the Australian Democrats, Senator

Michael Macklin, said today.

Senator Macklin said that the Government proposed in its Green

Paper on Higher Education that individual institutions negotiate

contracts with the Commonwealth as to what each of their roles

and missions should be, including, for example, fields of study,

areas of research and enrolment rn.i.x. The resulting educational

profile would become a basis for funding.

The problem with this approach was that the Government was clearly

in a much more powerful position in negotiation than any single

higher education institution.  '

It could simply dismiss what individual institutions considered

important if their priorities did not meet what the Government

had determined were 'national priorities .  '

The danger of such an unequal contest was made more likely because ‘

the Government wanted to abolish the Commonwealth Tertiary Education

Commission, the statutory advisory and funding body, which had protected

institutional autonomy from excessive political 'interference.

The replacement body for CTEC, the National Board of Employment,

Education and Training, as proposed to date, would be far weaker

and less independent of government than CTEC had been.

As a result, there would be no strong counter- balance of

longer-term views on roles and missions of higher education institutions

at Commonwealth level to government stress on short-term economic

and social priorities.

If the Government wished to ease the inevitable fears in higher

education at the use of educational profiles, it would have to

0 0 3 3 3 2

strengthen the independence and public reporting abilities of

the proposed National Board of Employment, Education and

Training.
