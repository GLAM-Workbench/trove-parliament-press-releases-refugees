ABC News 24 Capital Hill — Interview  with Lyndal Curtis  Subject: ALP National Conference

Transcript, E&OE

2 December 2011

LYNDAL CURTIS: I'm joined now by Richard Marles, a Victorian Member of the ALP  who's also a parliamentary secretary and a member of the right faction. Richard, welcome to  Capital Hill.

RICHARD MARLES: Thank you,Lyndal. It's great to be here.

LYNDAL CURTIS: This conference, the Prime Minister says it's not a coronation. She's  here for debate. She's encouraging debates. How much better is it to have those debates and  maybe occasionally be portrayed as internally divided than to have an anodyne and bland  conference that we saw in 2009?

RICHARD MARLES: I don't think anyone wants an anodyne or bland conference. And I  think it's a sign of a healthy party that we have the ability to have debates. And this weekend  we're going to see lots of discussions, lots of noise and that's a great thing.

And really it stands in pretty stark contrast to what we see on the other side of politics where  when you talk about the Liberals there are absolutely no ideas at all. I mean if they were  having this event they'd have nothing to talk about other than say no [indistinct] Greens who  do everything behind closed doors.

So we're looking forward to some pretty vibrant debates about the future of our country, and  that's what you'd want to see for the party in government.

LYNDAL CURTIS: The Prime Minister opened the conference with a very broad and very  general speech about Labor values and about jobs.

She didn't mention any of the specific debates that are coming up in the conference — not the  debate about uranium that she started, or the debate about same sex marriage. Was it a bit  timid not to go there first up?

RICHARD MARLES: I think we will see all of those debates play out in the next few days,  but what's really important to lay out at the start of the conference — which is what the Prime  Minister did — what this government has done.

And if this government has stood for anything, it's stood for jobs, and making jobs, and  creating jobs which we've done since coming to power in 2007.

Seven hundred and fifty thousand jobs — that's an enormous contribution going through the  global economic crisis.

And to set out why we've done that, the importance of that, how we've managed to achieve it  and where we're going in the future in relation to that is exactly what the Prime Minister  should do at the outset of the Labor Party conference.

LYNDAL CURTIS: Was is a recognition that, as some have said, that this conference needs  to be more than just about gay marriage — you need to be seen to be having the debates  about the economy as well, to be seen to be showing the public that their interests are  uppermost — not just what some in the public may see as a narrow interest which doesn't  impact on their lives.

RICHARD MARLES: Well the debate around same sex marriage is obviously a very  important debate and it matters greatly to many in our community. Having said that, it's  wrong to describe it as just being seen to be having debates around the economy. We are  having debates around the economy.

And that's very much the centrepiece of what Labor is about. Labor was founded around  economic issues and values around economic propositions, and this government has been  about the managing of the economy and managing the economy in a way which is the envy  of the developed world, and managing the economy for jobs — which is a very traditional

Labor thing to do. So it's not being seen to have those debates, that's what we're focusing on.

And when you look at, for example, the debate around selling uranium to India, that is  fundamentally a debate around jobs, and an economic debate, as it is of course a debate  around foreign policy, and other issues come into it.

But that's why we would be considering that. And right now as we're talking there is a really  fundamental debate going on in the conference room about the way in which we manage the  economy through 2012. So you know, that's our work.

LYNDAL CURTIS: And debates even about something that the Prime Minister mentioned  as the sign that you're governing for all Australians, about the need to get to a budget surplus  in 2012-13. There are some in the conference — as indeed economists have said — that if

Europe turns bad, then that surplus promise shouldn't necessarily be delivered if you need the  wriggle room to spend some money.

RICHARD MARLES: Well firstly I'd say it is important that we do hear all those views,  and there are as you say people who would suggest within our party that the achievement of a  surplus is not their number one priority, but from my point of view I think it's very important  that we continue the work of trying to achieve a surplus in — at the next budget.

One of the reasons why we as an economy have stood out within the developed world as  really being the envy of the world is because we have had plans about how to manage our  economy, and we've stuck to them.

And I think it's really important that we continue to work to return the budget to surplus.  We're in a position to do that. We are an economy which is still very much vibrant, and  because of the decisions the previous Labor government's made about being more integrated  with Asia we are able to take on the benefit of that.

We can get the economy back to surplus and we need to do that.

LYNDAL CURTIS: If we could go to the debate tomorrow morning on same sex marriage,  what's your view first on changing the platform and second on the conscience vote?

RICHARD MARLES: Well perhaps deal with the second first. I think the fundamental  thing here is that we do allow MPs to exercise a conscience vote within the Parliament. I  think that is the most fundamental thing that must come out of this conference. This is an

issue of deep personal conviction to people within the party, and it's important that they're  able to give expression to that personal conviction.

I actually think the issue around the platform is less important — and there'll be a bit to play  out on that. But from my point of view I think the fundamental thing which has to come out  of this conference is the ability for MPs to express a conscience vote on this issue.

LYNDAL CURTIS: Is it odd though that the right has locked in its delegates, is calling for a  bloc vote on something that is a conscience vote.

RICHARD MARLES: Oh, I don't think that's odd at all. I think that that's certainly about  the process of this conference. But what we need to see as an outcome from this is that we  actually allow people of different convictions on this issue to be able to express those  convictions within the Parliament.

That's what having a consistent view from the right in relation to having a conscience vote  will achieve, and I think that's perfectly appropriate. The thing is this, if you don't do that,  then the alternative to come from this conference will be a decision which binds people on  this issue, so people who have very strong convictions will be unable to give expression to

them.

That's not something I agree with. And I think it's really important that people are able to say  what they believe on this.

LYNDAL CURTIS: The Prime Minister put the conscience vote on the table. It is also  important for the conference not to be seen to be rebuffing the Prime Minister?

RICHARD MARLES: Well the Prime Minister has a view which I share, which is that this  is a matter of strong conviction. She's expressed her view on this issue and people will have  very different views on this issue and I think what matters is that people are given that  opportunity. That's certainly the position that I hold, that we need to be giving people that  opportunity, and I support the Prime Minister in that.

In relation to that conscience vote I'll be exercising my conscience in support of same sex  marriage. I think it is an important matter of equality within our society, and I think we are at  a point now in our history where we can start to comprehend this. We've done a lot of great  work in Government in terms of removing discrimination from a range of pieces of  legislation to make things equal in terms of the rights of people who are in same sex

relationships as compared to those in marriages as is currently defined. But I think it is now  right to move to a point where we define marriage in a way which does comprehend same sex  couples. That's the right and the fair thing to do.

LYNDAL CURTIS: Where do you think that the vote will come down in the uranium  debate? It's not a clear factional split; there are some from the left who support the sale of  uranium to India, some from the right who oppose it.

RICHARD MARLES: Well I certainly hope that we do take the decision at this conference  to enable us to sell uranium to India. I think that's a very important position. It's an important  position for a few reasons; firstly the arrangements and the agreements that now exist  between India and America have really changed the international game in relation to being  able to sell uranium to India. And India has been exemplary in their receiving of uranium and  the way in which they've used it.

I think it is important in terms of our relationship with India that we make this change as we  go forward over the next couple of decades. We, of course, talk a lot about the rise of China,  and that's going to be a very important influence over our country, but so too is the rise of  India. We will have, in a decade or two, two large powers within our region with populations  of more than a billion, India is the other. We've got to get our relationship right with India  and it's appropriate that we do that in relation to uranium. The Indians rightly say at the  moment in circumstances where we're prepared to sell uranium to China and Russia, why  aren't we prepared to sell uranium to India? This is something we've got to sort in relation to  our relationship with India.

But the other point is this; this represents Australian jobs. It represents Australian jobs in the  uranium industry, it also represents Australian jobs in terms of building a better trade  relationship with India, and that's a very important thing we need to do for our own domestic  economy.

LYNDAL CURTIS: Finally there'll also be a debate on asylum seekers and refugees. The  Immigration Minister Chris Bowen has floated the possibility of increasing the refugee intake  in support for support on offshore processing. But the High Court's ruled out offshore  processing. You don't have the numbers to get that through the Parliament. You've been  involved in the debate to get a regional approach to offshore processing through your role as

Pacific Island Affairs Parliamentary Secretary. Is the reality that you're going to be faced with  onshore processing only for quite some time to come?

RICHARD MARLES: Well there are a couple of things here. If we're talking about the  position of the party I think it's very important that the platform comprehends the enormous  change in the landscape that occurred when the High Court made its decision in relation to

offshore processing. That really did change the game, and it meant a lot of the positions held  were effectively out of date from the moment that decision came down. So it's important that  we do amend our platform to comprehend that decision and comprehend what the  Government would want to do in relation to putting in place the Malaysian arrangement.

We, as a Government, absolutely stand firm on the significance of that arrangement. We do  need to put in place arrangements which stop the boats coming and stop people risking their  lives in that very dangerous journey and put some order back into the process by which we  take asylum seekers into this country, an order which means that the UNHCR are put in the  driver's seat and not people smugglers in Indonesia.

So I think it is important that we deal with the party platform in that regard. Of course in  terms of how we move forward in relation to the parliament, that is ultimately a matter for  Tony Abbott. And Tony Abbott really does have to stop saying no to everything and start  being true to his convictions, which for the last 10 years have been in support of offshore  processing. In terms of increasing the asylum intake into this country, it's a really important  aspiration to increase that from what it is at the moment of 13,750 to a point in the future

being 20,000. We are a country which can cope with that and this is a very important  contribution to the world in terms of taking those most in need. And it's a very Labor thing to  do and I reckon it's a really important aspiration to be stated at this conference.

LYNDAL CURTIS: Richard Marles thank you very much for your time.

RICHARD MARLES: Thank you, Lyndal.
