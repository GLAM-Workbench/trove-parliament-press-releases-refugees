The Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Robert Hill,  today called on the Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, to live up to  his undertaking of three weeks ago to seek United Nations  intervention in the conflict in Yugoslavia.

"News from Yugoslavia suggests the deepening conflict may lead  to a tragic escalation in the loss of life and the possibility  that the conflict will spread beyond Yugoslavia's borders," Senator Hill said.

"The statement by the Chairman of the Yugoslav Presidency, Mr  Stipe Mesic, that Yugoslav military forces were no longer  under constitutional control marks a serious deterioration in  the situation and justifies a call for UN intervention.

"The flow of refugees now moving into Italy underlines the  fact that the crisis may not be kept within national borders.

"Moves by Yugoslav forces to take control of the Adriatic  coast are disturbing because they suggest these forces believe  a settlement of border issues can be reached through force.

"The European Community (EC) peace talks are not making  progress in bringing an end to the conflict.

"The wider international community must now act through the UN  Security Council to convince the parties that the recasting of  what has been the Yugoslav federation can be accomplished only  at the negotiating table.

"Mr Hawke's inaction contrasts starkly with the concern he  showed on the Midday Show last month when he called for UN  action.

"In the rapidly deteriorating situation, it is simply not good  enough to say that the Australian Ambassador to the UN, Dr  Wilenski, is keeping abreast of developments.

"It's time Mr Hawke lived up to his undertaking and made real Â§

moves to seek UN intervention in the conflict in Yugoslavia."
