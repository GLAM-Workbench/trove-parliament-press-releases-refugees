REFUGEES IN THAILAND '  '

The Australian Government has accepted for  settlement in Australia a group of Kampucheans from those

temporarily in Thailand. These are close relatives of

residents of Australia. .

Ã¢ÂÂ¢  .  ’  "  Â· .  .  Â·  t

This was announced today by the Minister for

Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, the Hon. M.J.R. MacKellar.

,  . M r  MacKellar said that in co-operation with the

Thai authorities, Australian migration officers had made

contact with these people and had given an undertaking to

accept them. They are now in a camp near Aranyaprathet.

This had been accomplished speedily and without fuss.

V  .  .

"People who claim that Australia should accept large numbers of people from those crossing the border into

Thailand are ignoring the magnitude of the total IndoÂ­

Chinese problem. Australia has a firm commitment to accept

a substantial number of people from UNHCR camps in several

countries in the region including Thailand."

Mr MacKellar stressed that responsibility for the

problem does not lie with the countries of temporary refuge

or permanent settlement. It rests squarely with those

responsible for the harsh conditions and callous treatment

which lead to the mass movements.
