BARRY O’FARRELL:

It’s fantastic to welcome Tony Abbott to St Marys Police Station, fantastic to see him in the west again. I  have to say as the Premier of this state it is terrific to hear a federal leader talk in advance of an election  campaign and before an election of what he is going to do for western Sydney, whether it is infrastructure or  in this case whether it is law and order.

Tony?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, Barry thank you so much and it is great to be here with the Premier, it is great to be here with the  Police Minister, it’s great to be her with the Shadow Minister for Justice and Customs Michael Keenan and  also with Fiona Scott our candidate for Lindsay.

What I want to talk about today is how an incoming Coalition government will do our bit to crack down on  gun crime right around Australia. I regret to say that the current government in losing control of our borders  has not just failed to stop the boats but it has failed to stop the guns as well. Under the former Coalition  Government over 60 per cent of incoming air cargos were screened. It is down to under 10 per cent because  of some $60 million in cuts to the customs budget and some hundreds of personnel who have gone from our  customs service.

So, I essentially have three things to say today. First of all we will put $100 million more into customs,  particularly into customs screening. Second, we will ensure that the illegal importation of guns attracts a  minimum mandatory five year sentence and third we will work with the states and territories to ensure that  we have local gang squads because it is very important that the fight against organised crime is as flexible  and responsive as the criminals themselves. We need to be able to adapt to local circumstances and the

2



Commonwealth under a Coalition government will work very closely with state and territory police on the  ground to ensure that we are responding as we need to, to developments in the fight against organised crime.

Now, Michael I might ask you to say a few words too mate then we’ll take some questions.

MICHAEL KEENAN:

Well, it is great to be here with Tony and the Premier and Fiona and Mike. This policy is about doing two  things. Firstly, it’s about making sure that the Commonwealth takes care of its responsibilities for law  enforcement in New South Wales and other parts of Australia. At the moment the Commonwealth is failing  to do that by failing to protect our borders and as a result we have seen an increase in guns, an increase in  drugs and an increase in other contraband that should be stopped at our borders before it hits our streets and  becomes a problem with the New South Wales Police or other state police forces.

Secondly, we want to find ways that the Commonwealth can use its weight to do all we can to help states  provide local law and order and to make people feel secure on their streets and in their homes. To do that we  will be allocating $50 million over four years for our safer streets programme which will go to funding local  crime infrastructure in areas such as here and Lindsay.

We need to make sure that the Commonwealth is fulfilling its part of the bargain. Law and order is a shared  responsibility between the states and the Commonwealth and at the moment the Commonwealth is not doing  its job by not policing our borders appropriately and leaving state police forces to clean up the mess.

TONY ABBOTT:

Ok, before I take questions I probably should just add that one of the interesting observations from New  South Wales Police was that 93 per cent of drive by shootings in this state involve hand guns and 100 per  cent of hand guns come from overseas. That is why it is so important if we are to properly crack down on  gun crime here in Sydney and right around Australia we get customs screening back up to scratch.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, do you think you now have this election in the bag given the state of the polls today?

TONY ABBOTT:

Absolutely not, I have always said that the contemporary Labor Party are hopeless at government but they  are brilliant at low politics and the lower the politics the better they are at it. What we are obviously going to  see is an absolute barrage of union funded negative advertising. I understand it has already started and that  means that this election is going to be a struggle. I have always said that winning from Opposition is like  climbing Mount Everest and nothing that has happened over the last few days has changed my judgement.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, last week you said you would preference the Greens last but you haven’t done that in the Senate.  Why have you broken that pledge? In every state and territory except Tasmania and the ACT the Greens  haven’t been put last.

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, there are one or two Parties that are frankly racist and they have been put behind the Greens but  everywhere, everywhere, no exceptions the Greens are behind the Labor Party because they are economic  fringe dwellers and there is the great contrast between myself and Mr Rudd. We have got the Greens, a  Party, they want to close down the forestry industry, they want to close down the fishing industry, they want

3



to close down the coal industry, they want to close down live exports. They are an anti-jobs Party and yet the  Labor leader has put politics ahead of jobs by preferencing the Greens ahead of the Coalition everywhere.  We’ve preferenced Labor ahead of the Greens everywhere.

QUESTION:

Why don’t you make that your speech rather than saying you’d put them last. Why didn’t you say you’d put  them below Labor?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, what I said was that they are going last of all the significant parties and that’s exactly where they’ve  been.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, just on paid parental leave, Mr Abbott, one of the savings measures that you’re counting is  preventing state public service workers from double dipping, that of course has been costed by the PBO you  say. What’s the value of that saving? You must be able to put a dollar figure on it? I mean how is it real?  Don’t you need an agreement with the states to do that? Aren’t you just announcing something now and  trying to finalise it later?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, there are many things which are obviously subject to agreement, but sensible adult governments are  normally able to get agreement and obviously the state premiers understand that if we are relieving them of  some hundreds of millions of dollars of obligations that they’ve got, there ought to be a fair trade-off. The  state premiers understand that and we’ve got some 18 months or so between an election should we win and  the beginning of the policy and that is more than enough time for sensible adult governments to sit down and  negotiate what are sensible win-win arrangements.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, you’ve been talking to small business today and your Real Solutions booklet outlines the five  pillar economy that the Coalition will build to ensure against the decline in the mining boom. I’m wondering  if Ms Scott could outline for the voters in Lindsay what those five pillars are and how they’ll make a  difference to voters here?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look and she’s going to add to my response, but I’m pleased James that you’ve raised this issue, because  we’ve had a very successful mining sector, we’ve had a manufacturing sector which is obviously under great  pressure. We’ve had an agriculture sector which is important, but we’ve also got an education sector and a  services sector and we want all of those five pillars to flourish and that’s why we’re going to abolish the  carbon tax, abolish the mining tax, cut the company tax, get red tape down and it doesn’t matter where you  are, whether you’re here in Lindsay or right around Australia, very important that we get this policy right  and the great thing about Fiona, c’mon forward Fiona - the great thing about voting for Fiona Scott in  Lindsay is that you are voting for policies that will turn the five pillar economy from an aspiration to a  reality.

FIONA SCOTT:

That’s actually a really good question and if we look here in Lindsay, our workforce overwhelmingly has to  commute every day for work. So 65 per cent of our workforce has to commute every single day. One third

4



into greater western Sydney and one third into the city itself. If you look at Lindsay, we are one of the bigger  metropolitan electorates, so we do have an agricultural sector here that does have hobby farms, eggplants,  oh, poultry farms, as well as turf farms. We also have a manufacturing sector that has been struggling, but  we do see some manufacturing coming back online here in Lindsay which is very, very important. UWS is a  very important pillar to our economy here, because not only did I go to that university, but it is training the  leaders for the future. Then if you go across to services, well our services here in Lindsay need to support  the full gauntlet of what’s going to be important for our region going forward. So, if you do look across the  five sectors of manufacturing, agriculture, mining, so we do have the quarries here at the Penrith Lakes. So,  if you look across the total of the five sectors they are important and that’s why the five pillar approach here  in Lindsay is going to be really important to get more jobs here locally to actually improve our economy.

TONY ABBOTT:

And at the risk of exciting anyone, can I just say, obviously from that answer, she ain’t just a pretty face ok?

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, have you apologised to Fiona Scott for the comments that you made about her and Fiona have  you been treated differently by people in the electorate?

FIONA SCOTT:

Look, Tony Abbott has been a very good supporter to my career and Tony Abbott’s and Tony Abbott’s  whole family have supported me to no end. There’s no need to apologies for what is an absolute charming  compliment between friends. So, look I think it’s a sad day when a man cannot compliment a woman in  what is a charming compliment. So, look there’s no need to apologise and it’s nice to have lighter moments  in politics, but today we’re actually talking about a really serious issue about gun crime right across this  State and I think what we’ve got with the Premier here today and with Tony Abbott, it’s important that we  actually focus on how we can tackle gun crime in this State.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, can you clarify something Joe Hockey said on radio this morning about the paid parental leave  scheme. He said that women who receive the money will have the option to quit their job after the six  months. Is this the case and if so, doesn’t that defeat the whole purpose of trying to get women back into the  workforce?

TONY ABBOTT:

The eligibility rules for our paid parental leave scheme are exactly the same in that respect as the eligibility  rule for the Government’s scheme. Now, yes we aren’t forcing women back to work but if you give people  the best possible conditions in a fair dinkum paid parental leave scheme is part of giving people the best  possible conditions, you are most likely to keep them in the workforce. I want to make the general point if I  may; every economist will say, that if we want a stronger economy we have got to address the three ‘Ps’,  population, participation and productivity.  A paid parental leave scheme is good for all three of those  things, that’s why of the 30 odd OECD countries only one lacks a paid parental leave scheme and of those  that do have a paid parental leave scheme Australia is currently one of only two where it is not based on a  real wage. So, that is why this is such an important economic reform as well as an important social and  family reform.

QUESTION:

5



Just on the funding for that paid parental leave scheme reports today suggest that the bulk of the 1.5 per cent  levy will be hit by, effectively a fact to do with franking credits in future years and will be $2 billion less has  that specific element been factored into you saying it will be revenue neutral in terms of costings?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, the franking credit issue has certainly been dealt with by the Parliamentary Budget Office as part of  our costings, we are not changing the way that franking credits work, obviously if there is  reduction in  company tax there is a reduction in the franking credit, that’s just the way the system works. But again I  want to stress that this is a very important economic reform it has been professionally costed by the  Parliamentary Budget Office, it is fully costed and fully funded and it is going to be a great advance for our  economy and for our society.

QUESTION:

Chris Richardson has said that your policy is unsustainable, the paid parental leave scheme policy, can you  quantify how it will boost productivity?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, it is absolutely sustainable because it’s fully costed and fully funded. Our policy is the same broad  policy as exits in most of the OECD countries right around the world, now why is it that it is sustainable  there and  unsustainable here? I would respectively suggest to the learned economist in question that he go  back and look at the Productivity Commission report that he read our policy and I am confident that fair  minded observers looking at our policy will accept that it is good for our economy, as well as being good for  our society.

QUESTION:

This is actually for Mr O’Farrell and the Police Minister. There has been a drive by shooting quite recently  around here, do these measures go far enough given how bad crime is in some parts of western Sydney?

BARRY O’FARRELL:

These measures are terrific because as Police Commissioner Scipione again reaffirmed more than 90 per  cent of all drive by shootings involve handguns. As Tony Abbott says correctly a 100 per cent of those  handguns are imported into this country. So, reversing Labor’s cuts to Customs, to the Federal Police and  the Australian Crime Commission will go a long way to stopping gun importation into this country. Look,  NSW police are seizing guns off the street every week, but as fast as they take those guns more are coming  into this country and the worst scandal was early last year where they intercepted the importation of 200  Glock pistols through an Australia Post sub agency in Sylvania Waters. That wouldn’t happen if we had the  same inspection rates of air cargo that existed under the Howard Government. Under the Howard  Government 60 per cent of all air cargo was inspected by Customs, its fallen to less than 10 per cent and that  is what is frustrating New South Wales Police. That is why I’m happy to be here today supporting Tony  Abbott’s policy of using federal resources, reversing Labor’s cuts to Customs, to Federal Police and to the  Australian Crime Commission to tackle this problem effectively.

QUESTION:

Do you have any plans to massively expand the 457 scheme as has been alleged by the construction union  today?

TONY ABBOTT:

6



Look, what we are seeing from the Labor Party is lie after lie after lie, Mr Rudd should stood up yesterday  and he said, ‘cut after cut after cut’. Well, I’m sorry Mr Rudd, it’s lie after lie after lie. What we want to do  is build, build, build so that there are jobs, jobs, jobs for Australians. That is what we are going to do. Now,  the thing about 457 visa holders is that they come into this country and they work and they pay taxes from  day one and there are two fundamental conditions for a 457. First there can be no readily available local to  do the job and second they have got to be paid full market wages, and because an employer has got to bring  the person to the country and look after them initially its far more expensive to employ a 457 visa holder  than it is to employ a local. It’s never advantageous, where there are available locals, to use a 457 visa  holder instead. But these 457 Visa holders, they work, they pay taxes from day one. They aren’t stealing our  jobs, they’re building our country and it appals me, it really appals me that the unions and Mr Rudd are  running this campaign effectively to demonise the skilled migrants upon whose backs our country has been  built. Just about every Australian is a migrant or a descendant of migrants and frankly we should be  honouring and cherishing the contribution that migrants who’ve come to this country, legally, the right way  to join our team have made and Mr Rudd really should dissociate himself from this particular union  campaign, particularly given one of the first things that he said on coming back into the Prime Ministership  was I’m sick of all the politics of division.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, on boats, do you believe the Coalition should be at the forum, regional forum tomorrow in  Jakarta?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, yet again we’ve got a situation where the Government appears to be pretty desultory in its observance  of the caretaker conventions. Look, I’m not going to object to ministers going to this particular forum but  frankly they cannot make commitments on behalf of Australia without getting the agreement of the  Opposition in writing and if they want to make commitments on behalf of Australia they’re going to have to  talk to us.

QUESTION:

On the same subject, Mr Abbott the asylum seeker vessel that arrived yesterday was the first in four days. I  don’t think we’ve seen [inaudible] in a long time. Do you now accept that the trend is going downwards on  boat arrivals?

TONY ABBOTT:

I accept that there will be surges and there will be lulls. There always have been. The problem is that this  Government’s so-called PNG solution is already overwhelmed by the tide of boat arrivals since Mr Rudd  first made the announcement. Mr Rudd’s announcement was materially misleading. It was materially  misleading. He said two things. First, he said that no one who comes illegally to Australia by boat will come  back to Australia. False. The PNG Government has confirmed that some of them will come back to  Australia. Second, that all of them who come here will initially go to PNG. Again false. The building of a  new detention centre in Singleton confirms that.

QUESTION:

Should Australian athletes boycott next year’s Winter Olympics in Russia as a protest against that country’s  strict anti-homosexual laws?

TONY ABBOTT:

That’s a matter for individual athletes.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, have you seen Labor’s latest attack ad?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, I was shown an ad on one of my staff’s iPads earlier this morning and again it is embarrassing. It is  really embarrassing that a government which has been in power for almost six years, a Prime Minister who’s  been in office for almost three years has no record to defend and nothing positive to say about the future and  is making a whole series of absolutely outlandish and false claims about the Opposition and again, Mr Rudd  should be better than that. With all my heart, he said, with all my heart he said, I want to see positive politics  and already he’s scarcely been there six weeks, the campaign is scarcely two weeks old and these are the  depths that he is plumbing.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, Kevin Rudd has accused you of going to throw the economy into recession. If current trends  continue and we see declining tax receipts and revised growth downwards, would you spend more or would  you rely on lower interest rates?

TONY ABBOTT:

I want to unshackle the creativity of the Australian people, and this is the problem. At every turn, Mr Rudd  has made it harder to invest, to employ and to work. That’s why it is so important that we abolish the carbon  tax, abolish the mining tax, cut red tape, have a one stop shop for environmental approvals, encourage and  appreciate small business in particular. I have so much confidence in the people of Australia but we need a  government which works with them. Not which is constantly trying to put obstacles in their way and the  point that I’ll be making on September the 8th, should there be a change of government, Australia is under  new management. Australia is under new management and Australia is once more open for business.

Thank you.
