BUDGET INITIATIVES OFFER MORE TO REFUGEES AND 
MULTICULTURALISM

Â

The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock, 
today said wide-ranging initiatives contained in  the 1999-2000 
Budget provided further development in refugee application processes 
and a greater focus on Australia’s cultural diversity.

Â

“These initiatives build on strategies already implemented 
and aim to enhance an immigration and multicultural affairs program 
that benefits all Australians,” Mr Ruddock said.

Â

Budget initiatives include:

Â

Asylum Seeker Assistance Scheme

Â

*Â   The Asylum Seeker Assistance (ASA) Scheme will be extended to provide 
help to a limited number of people in urgent need of assistance during 
review of their failed Protection Visa applications

Â

“It has become clear that there is a need to provide 
assistance for basic essentials to certain vulnerable people living 
in the community during the period their failed applications are under 
review by a merits review tribunal,” Mr Ruddock said.

Â

*Â   Assistance will continue to be unavailable to failed asylum seekers 
who are attempting the next level of review

Â

“Evidence still points to high levels of misuse 
of the protection visa process by people who are not genuine refugees. 
Unfortunately, many people prolong the process in order to remain in 
Australia because they have no other lawful means of staying here." 
Mr Ruddock said.

Â

Living in Harmony

Â

*Â   The Commonwealth Government has added a further $5 million to the 
Living In Harmony initiative

Â

“The Government has honoured its promise made prior to the recent 
election to contribute an additional $5 million to the Government’s 
Living in Harmony initiative, taking the total sum for the campaign 
to $10  million over two years." the Minister said.

Â

Since its launch in August 1998, the three key elements 
to the Living in Harmony initiative — the community grants program, 
the partnerships program, and the public information strategy — have 
provided a focus for activities promoting community harmony and acceptance 
of diversity.

Â

*Â   These funds now allow further support to go out to local groups, under 
the community grants program, to focus their efforts on creating and 
maintaining community harmony at the grass roots level”

Â

Another 50 successful grant applicants will be announced 
in the near future, totalling around $2.5 million, bringing the amount 
for these community-based projects to $5 million,” Mr Ruddock said.

Â

“This will reinforce the message that there is no 
place in Australia for racial intolerance or disharmony.”

Â

Review tribunals

Â

*Â   Changes will give more autonomy to the Refugee Review Tribunal (RRT) 
and the newly-established Migration Review Tribunal (MRT)

Â

The MRT is a new independent organisation to review 
immigration decisions which will come into being on 1 June 1999

Â

“The MRT will replace the two tiers of review currently 
performed by my Department’s Migration Internal Review Office (MIRO) 
and the independent Immigration Review Tribunal (IRT),” Mr Ruddock 
said.

Â

“The RRT is an independent organisation which provides 
merits review of decisions made by my Department to refuse or cancel 
a Protection Visa.

Â

“In line with Government priorities, both Tribunals 
have been prescribed under the Financial Management and   Accountability Act  to ensure each Tribunal has full responsibility 
for financial management”.

Â

Both the RRT and MRT will be prescribed on 1 July 
1999.

Â

*Â   The $1,000 fee relating to applications which fail at the RT review 
stage is currently under review by the Joint Standing Committee on Migration

Â

“The $1,000 post-decision fee only applies to non-bona 
fide applicants found not to be refugees after receiving the Rat’s 
decision. The post-decision fee has had a positive effect in reducing 
the number of applications from people seeking to misuse the system’ 
Mr Ruddock said.

Â

“Australia now has two totally independent review tribunals ensuring 
the continued integrity of Australia’s refugee programs”.

Â

Presence in East Timer

Â

*Â   Funding has been provided for a Department of Immigration and Multicultural 
Affairs’ presence at the proposed new Australian Consulate-General 
in Dill

Â

“The range of measures I have announced today, together 
with the measures already in place mean that Australians can be sure 
that their country has a relevant and forward-looking immigration program,” 
Mr Ruddock said.
