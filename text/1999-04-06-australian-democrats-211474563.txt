Democrats welcome extra assistance for Kosovo 
- but permanent residency for refugees must not be ruled out.

Â

The Australian Democrats have stron gly welcomed and endorsed 
the federal government’s announcement of extra financial assistance 
for the Kosovo refugees and the indication that an initial number of 
4000 refugees will be allowed into Australia.

Â

The Democrats’ spokesperson for immigration, Senator 
Andrew Bartlett said he was pleased the Coalition had recognised Australia’s 
obligation to assist with the crisis.

Â

“The Democrats are willing to support the proposed legislation enabling 
these refugees to come into Australia, pending more detail on the actual 
legal status which these people will have,” said Senator Bartlett.

Â

“However, it is hard to see precisely why special legislation is 
needed before we can bring extra refugees into Australia.

Â

“The Democrats believe it is crucial that the Prime Minister enable 
permanent residency down the track for any refugees who wish to remain 
in Australia.

Â

“As the Immigration Minister, Mr Ruddock, and groups 
such as the Ethnic Communities Council have pointed out, only offering 
temporary refuge is not always going to be in the interests of the refugee.

Â

“If reports are correct that the Prime Minister intends preventing 
people from applying for refugee status whilst they are in Australia, 
it may further add to the trauma experienced by these people by leaving 
their future unresolved. There would also be serious questions about 
whether such a prohibition would breach Australia’s legal obligations 
to offer asylum to people who meet the legal definition of refugees.

Â

“All people granted refugee status in Australia 
have the choice to return to their country of origin at a later time 
if they choose. The key issue is that it should be the choice of the 
refugee, not the country that offers asylum,” Senator Bartlett said.

Â

“Asylum is not genuine if it is only temporary and 
lasts only as long as the discretion of the government which is offering 
it.

Â

“To ensure Australia’s assistance for potential 
migrants from Kosovo is genuine, the government must also be doing what 
it can to fast-track special humanitarian applications and to identify 
Albanians with family connections or support in Australia to be identified 
as quickly as possible.

Â

“The Democrats note the Prime Minister’s comment 
that the main thing is to provide assistance now and worry about the 
details later. This is an appropriate stance.”
