Subjects: Carbon price campaign, Malaysia asylum-seeker deal, Abbott’s financial  trickery and superannuation promise.



MARK PARTON:  Chris Smith broadcasting live from midday today at the  Australian Institute of Sport. Now, Chris was in the studio earlier  this morning and it was fascinating to hear him applauding the  Prime Minister - because he was. He was applauding Julia  Gillard for the hard work that sheÃ¢ÂÂs doing in endeavouring to sell  the carbon tax, you know. He said, Ã¢ÂÂhey, she is out there having  a goÃ¢ÂÂ, and having a go has translated to a slight increase in the  popularity, according to the latest polls. I think itÃ¢ÂÂs gone up two  points, from nowhere to not far from nowhere, and IÃ¢ÂÂm sure it put  a smile on the face of the Federal Trade Minister Dr Craig  Emerson, who joins us right now. GÃ¢ÂÂday Craig.



CRAIG EMERSON: Good morning, Parto!

PARTON:  I saw Wayne Swan commenting on that move in the polls. I donÃ¢ÂÂt  often see him commenting if itÃ¢ÂÂs going the other way. But with a  positive, letÃ¢ÂÂs trumpet it, hey?



EMERSON:  Well, IÃ¢ÂÂm not sure what Wayne said so I canÃ¢ÂÂt really comment on  that. But IÃ¢ÂÂd observe that parliamentary terms are not one long  continuous opinion poll; youÃ¢ÂÂve got to do what you consider as  the Government to be in the national interest. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs what weÃ¢ÂÂve  been doing. If that happens to show in a lift in the polls, well then  so be it. But we wonÃ¢ÂÂt be deterred from doing what is in the  national interest. And I just remind your listeners, Mark, that Julia  Gillard, the Prime Minister, said this would be the year of

delivery. Well just in the last four weeks weÃ¢ÂÂve put the live cattle  trade to Indonesia on a sustainable footing; the Tasmanian  forestry issue which has been raging for 30 years has resulted in  a peace agreement that the Prime Minister helped broker; weÃ¢ÂÂve  put a price on carbon - weÃ¢ÂÂve released the details of that; and, of  course, the Malaysian asylum-seeker deal has been announced.  So not only the year of delivery; I say the month of delivery,  Mark.

PARTON:  Okay, so the Malaysian asylum-seeker deal has been  announced, to $292 million. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs for 800 refugees, and we  work out that thatÃ¢ÂÂs about $360,000 for each of them. That is a  hell of a lot of money.



EMERSON:  I think youÃ¢ÂÂll actually find Mark if you did the research - and IÃ¢ÂÂm  not saying you havenÃ¢ÂÂt had someone looking at it - but the bulk  of the dollar amount is used to bring in 1,000 asylum seekers,  genuine refugees into Australia a year. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs a total of 4,000. It  takes our refugee intake from 13,750 to 14,750 a year. So that is  actually the bulk of the cost, and of course if very few or no  people go to Malaysia on the way out the costs associated with  them would be very low indeed. And I tell you what, a hell of a lot  less than the so-called “Pacific Solution”, where people were left  to rot on Nauru at very great cost to taxpayers.



PARTON:  Okay, so time will tell how this goes now in terms of will this  actually stop the boats from coming, because if it does stop the  boats well IÃ¢ÂÂll be the first to say Ã¢ÂÂokay itÃ¢ÂÂs a fair bit of money but  itÃ¢ÂÂs workedÃ¢ÂÂ. What the hell are you going to do if we get to the  middle of November and weÃ¢ÂÂve already surpassed that 800  amount and all of a sudden it hasnÃ¢ÂÂt worked?



EMERSON:  Well it would be curious logic for people to come from their  country of source, arrive in Malaysia, then go to Indonesia, get  on a boat, take a risky journey across the sea to Australia to get  sent back to Malaysia and then keep doing it. It would be a very  strange thing to do so. YouÃ¢ÂÂre right: this is designed to break the  people smugglersÃ¢ÂÂ model, their sales pitch to people, because I  donÃ¢ÂÂt think too many asylum seekers would see the amusing  side of just going around from their country of origin to Malaysia,  to Indonesia, to Australia and then to Malaysia.



PARTON:  Have you considered perhaps adopting a term from the other  side and calling this “Stop the Boats”, Craig?

EMERSON:  WeÃ¢ÂÂre not into these three-word slogans. But while we are on  issues such as slogans, Tony Abbott is proving to be a real  hollow man, and itÃ¢ÂÂs been revealed, Mark, that on Friday night he  told a group of fund managers that he might not be able to  unwind the increase in superannuation from 9 per cent to 12 per

3



cent. Well, thatÃ¢ÂÂs being funded in large part by the mining tax.  And whatÃ¢ÂÂs clear from this so-called $50 billion worth of savings  is that he would abandon the small business tax breaks,  abandon the company tax rate reduction, but keep the revenue  from the mining tax. So itÃ¢ÂÂs becoming clear what his true agenda  is; that is, heÃ¢ÂÂll keep the mining tax but heÃ¢ÂÂll get rid of the very  beneficial uses which the mining tax revenue is to be put.

PARTON:  Craig, weÃ¢ÂÂre out of time, but thanks for joining us again this  morning.

EMERSON:  Thanks Mark.

PARTON:  Federal Trade Minister, Dr Craig Emerson.
