SUBJECTS: MYEFO; song

JOURNALIST:



(inaudible) any surprises today?

TREASURER:

No, I will just be updating the state of the Federal Budget and also the economic forecasts. Obviously with the attacks in New York, the world will be growing slower. The United States economy is now contracting and that will affect Australia. But we still have a pretty strong base to work from.

JOURNALIST:

Will the surplus be significantly smaller than announced in the May Budget?

TREASURER:

It will be a small surplus because we have had some additional expenditures since the May Budget, particularly in relation to unauthorised boat arrivals. But it will still be in surplus.

JOURNALIST:

What's the song of the day?

TREASURER:

Oh what a beautiful morning, oh what a glorious day.
