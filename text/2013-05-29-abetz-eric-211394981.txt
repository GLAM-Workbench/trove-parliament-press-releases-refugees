SENATE ESTIMATES COMMITTEES

Highlights from Day Two: 28 May 2013

Another day - More Government incompetence exposed

Truism confirmed   In one of his Jack Aubrey novels, author Patrick O’Brian has Stephen Maturin observe that one seldom hears a  person admit that they were asleep when they should have been awake or that they have enough money.   So  it was not surprising that Senate Estimates heard Immigration Department officials deny Thai Government  claims that Australian guards contracted to escort a prisoner who escaped whilst in transit were asleep when  the man escaped.

Reductio ad absurdum:   But the Department went further.  They went on to deny that the escapee was even a  prisoner.  No, he was just a person “undertaking a removal path”.   But if he wasn’t a ‘prisoner’ then logic  dictates he couldn’t have been in custody.  And if he wasn’t in custody, then logic also dictates that he couldn’t  have ‘escaped’.   And if he didn’t escape, then what’s the problem?   Just proves that this Government can  rationalise anything.



Pink batts debacle - it’s a write off  Labor’s failed home-insulation program, which was shut down after causing at least 200 house fires and was  linked to four deaths, is still costing taxpayers millions of dollars.  Senate Estimates was told that $18.5 million  in debts owed by dodgy installers has been written off over the last two financial years and another $11  million is still to be collected from installers who falsely claimed cash from the Government under the  program.  Of the debts still owing, $7 million is from the Rudd Government’s original plan and $3 million  relates to the assistance package that was meant to fix the problems the original plan created.

PS sickies up 25% in a decade but not ‘core business’  Unplanned absences (mainly sick days) have increased from 8.9 days per year in 2001-02 to 11.1 days in  2011.12 - an increase of 25%.  When it was suggested at Senate Estimates that unscheduled absences could  be costing taxpayers $2 billion a year and asked why the Public Service Commission didn’t seek to collect  detailed information from Departments and agencies on the reasons for these absences, the Commissioner

replied:  “I don’t regard it as core business for me to have to identify and cost that particular issue”.   As one  Coalition Senator later remarked:  “Not  the kind of remark you’d be likely to hear from a private sector  employer”.

Asylum seeker costs blow out  According to evidence given at Senate estimates the broad cost of operating the detention network at this  point of 2012-13 financial year is just shy of $1.5 billion, including:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Lease of some detention facilities -  $103 million  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Payment to Serco  to run the detention centres, including wages, food etc.   -  $686 million  Ã¢ÂÂ¢  Red Cross services  - $53 million  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Freight, charter and other travel - $107 million.  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Health services - $206 million  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Number of asylum seekers held in immigration network as at 30 April 2013  - 11,549  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Number of asylum seekers who had arrived by boat held in detention when Howard Government left

office - 4

Consequences of border protection failures  Under questioning at Senate Estimates, officials from the Immigration department revealed that:  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ There are 25 asylum seekers still at large out of the 63 who have escaped from immigration detention  centres in Australia in the past year

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ A suspected terrorist wanted on an Interpol ‘red notice’ lived at Inverbrackie (SA) with his family for about  nine months.  Osama bin Laden was also wanted on an Interpol ‘red notice’.  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ A Sri Lankan asylum seeker suspected of killing his girlfriend before fleeing to Australia by boat was  released into the community on a bridging visa for six months while his case was reviewed.

Antarctic Division put on ice  Australia’s world famous Antarctic Division is clearly not a Labor priority.  Estimates heard that:  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ For the third consecutive year the Antarctic Division has had to negotiate a one-off allocation of $9.5  million to maintain its operational activities, and nothing has been allocated to the Division in the forward

estimates years.     Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Australia will need a new ship to act as it Antarctic research vessel by 2017 but no funding has been  provided to build it (estimated to take two years)  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Funding for the ‘air link’ to Antarctica ends in June 2014, and no provision has been made for funding after

that time

In Brief

In other evidence, Estimates has learned that:  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The Department of Sustainability and Environment has so far taken no steps to allow tens of thousands of  drought-affected Queensland cattle to graze inside previous grazing properties that have now been  declared national parks.  Indeed, it has not even briefed its Minister on the issue.  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The Prime Minister’s Communications Director, who is in Australia on one of the section 457 visas the

Prime Minister says are so unfair to Australian-born workers, had the normal security clearance processes  ‘waived’ to enable him to work in the PM’s office.
