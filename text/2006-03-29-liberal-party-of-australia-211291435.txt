Faster Reviews of Protection Visa Decisions

29 March 2006

The Refugee Review Tribunal (RRT) has demonstrated a strong commitment to meeting the new 90-day time requirement for protection visa (PV)  reviews, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Senator Amanda Vanstone, said today.

‘Following the Prime Minister’s announcement of the 90-day time limit for the conduct of RRT reviews on June 17, 2005, the RRT has been able  to achieve significant improvement in the timeliness of reviews, with the average current processing time at 76 days in March - the lowest since  the RRT was established in 1993,’ the Minister said.

The first report on the RRT reviews that were not completed within 90 days, for July 1, 2005 to October 31, 2005, was tabled in Parliament today.

The report focuses on 1332 reviews finalised for this period and another 161 reviews which were not finalised during the reporting period. The  majority of these matters were already before the RRT when the Government announced the 90-day time limit.

‘Although 60 per cent of the 1332 reviews finalised were outside the 90-day time limit, the finalisation of these cases represents the clearing of a  significant backlog and provides a way forward to speedier reviews,’ Senator Vanstone said.

‘Of 1872 new review applications received between July 1, 2005 and February 28, 2006, 1357 were finalised within 90 days.

‘Delays with the remaining review applications are because of factors largely beyond the RRT’s control, such as security clearances through  external agencies.

‘I am pleased this report from the tribunal indicates improvements in the time reviews of decisions are taking place.

‘Completing the review of decisions in a timely manner is obviously beneficial to applicants and in line with the Government’s commitment to  greater efficiency.’
