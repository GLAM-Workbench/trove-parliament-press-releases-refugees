PRIME MINISTER'S PRESS CONFERENCE - KINGSTON

Following is the transcript of the Prime Minister's press   conference held in Kingston on 4 May 197 5 Ã¢ÂÂ  .

Prime Minister's Press Conference,  Jamaica, Sunday 4 May 1975.

Question: Is it true that you. have proposed a Commonwealth Aid scheme for Vietnam, as was reported in the local press here?

Prime Minister: No. I haven't been able to read the local press over the weekend.  I suppose the story would flow from the fact   that on Friday - just before we broke up for the weekend - I  suggested that there should be a reference in the communique at

the end of the conference,  to international assistance for   reconciliation and reconstruction in Vietnam. It was about as  brief as that, I .suggested that there should be some reference.

Question: What is you reaction to the position of Prime Minister Burnham of Guyana,  which is. that if action isn't taken to get a -  redistribution of wealth towards the developing country and the   developing countries will be justified in setting up producer-   only organisations to secure that change in the distribution of the   world's wealth? .  Ã¢ÂÂ Â·. Ã¢ÂÂ

Prime Minister:  Well some.of you know me and some of you don't. Therefore for the former I will repeat, for the others I will   state, that I do not answer questions which are predicated on   somebody else's summary of what some colleague might have said. When we were discussing the general economic trade matters, the

discussion was started by Prime Minister Wilson and the second   speaker was Prime Minister Burnham.  Prime Minister Burnham suggested   that there should be an expert group set up to examine all features   of trade with the objective of sharing the world's wealth more

equitably. Over the weekend the officials advising the various  Heads of Government have got together and they have produced the  terms of reference for the group of wise men. And I suppose that  those terms of reference and maybe,  the personnel in the group,  will be announced before we disperse from Kingston. But Prime  Minister Burnham's basic suggestion was that there should be an

expert committee appointed.by the Conference to advise the  Commonwealth Finance Ministers and also delegates from the Â· Commonwealth to .  the United' Nations General Assembly later in the  year.  And that suggestion has been acted on.

Question: Can you give me your version of the reported friction between Australia and New Zealand over the question of nuclear  free zones for the South Pacific?

Prime Minis,ter: The question of nuclear free zones has not been mentioned in the Conference or, as far as I know, outside it. I was told there was some reference to friction: there is no basis for any such report. -

Question: Can I ask your reaction to producer associations per s e ,  as against producer-consumer associations?

Prime Minister: Well the best thing would be to have producer-consumer associations.  Australia has been a member of such  associations for many years in the past in respect to  primary products. There have in recent years been several  producer associations in mineral resources.  Australia is a member

of one,  she is an observer at another and she is helping to found  a third. The best thing is to have both^producers and consumers  in such associations.  If, however, consumers will not join such  associations, producers should go ahead and form their ow n .  It

is certainly one of the trends at the moment that there should be  such associations.  One arose from the discussion at the last  Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Ottawa - the  International Bauxite Association.

Question: Prime Minister what would you reaction be to a request by white Rhodesians to come to Australia, when they  finally realise that they had to leave their own country or the  country that they are in now?

- 3-

Prirne Minister: This is entirely speculative. Australia like all other members of the United Nations are bound by certain   resolutions of the United Nations. Australia has followed those,   and particularly since my Government came to office, it has followed

them very strictly.

Question: Would you tell us whether your view of world trade is closer to that of Mr Burnham or Mr Wilson?

Prime Minister: This is far too simplistic a question. Mr Wilson supported at the end of the debate on this subject Mr Burnham's   proposal that there should be an expert group. .And from what I'm   told the British officials,  as well as the other officials,   have co-operated in the terms of reference which have been drawn   up over this weekend. I know it's a fascinating thing to have a

confrontation between Britain, and Guyana, it enthralls m e Ã¢ÂÂ I   haven't been able to sleep over the whole of the weekend as to the   outcome of such a confrontation.  But these things never seem to be   quite as dramatic in the oubcome.  .  .

Question: While here in Kingston Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore, commenting on Australia accepting refugees from Vietnam,   said: '  "Maybe it was a fit of emotional spasm, a sense of guilt, '

’  maybe some Aussie in a drurfken moment may have left something '  Â·

behind and therefore you. feel you have atoned for it, but have you"?   Can I ask you whether that's a rational assessment of Australia's   humanitarian efforts. Or alternatively do you regard the .;j. i

remarks as highly offensive and insulting? .

Prime Mini s t e r : .  Assuming you are correctly quoting, what Mr Lee   Kuan Yew said, I presume he was inferring that Australian soldiers,   during their service in Vietnam, had left children behind. If .   Australian soldiers have children in Vietnam, certainly the '   Australian Government would help to bring those children to   Australia. I have not come across any application to bring any .   Australian soldier's child to Australia. Perhaps I should add

that there have been quite a number of children brought from   Vietnam to Australia by the Australian Government - about 300   of them - and they were brought in these circumstances: where the former South Vietnamese Government had certified that these   .  children, were elegible for adoption and where the Australian ...... ..

i.n such matters in Australia - certified that there were suitable   parents waiting to adopt. So in those circumstances there has   been a reunion between about 300 eligible children and suitable   parents. My Government arranged some time last year that the   Australian Government would pay the passages of any children from   Vietnam who were coming for adoption in Australia. In this case,

of course, the children were brought in aircraft which belonged   to the Royal Australian Air Force or were chartered by the Australian   Government. I conclude, I know of no case where an Australian soldier s child has been nominated to come to Australia. U n Â­ questionably the Australian Government would have assisted in   bringing any such children to Australia.

Question: But was it done out of a sense of guilt, Prime Minister?   An emotional spasm as Mr Lee Kuan Yew has put it?

i. Ã¢ÂÂ  )

Prime Minister: I hesitate to comment on other p e o p l e ’s news conferences, because so often I find that a great deal is lost or   gained in transmission. I've stated the circumstances in which   children from Vietnam have been brought to Australia, and I   believe they are very proper circumstances. There was quite a   deal of agitation to bring many more children, but no greater   number of children could be found for whom the Vietnamese   Government was prepared to give a certificate that they were

available for adoption, or State Governments were prepared to give   certificates that there were suitable parents.

Question: What about adult Vietnamese? '

Prime Minister: The Australian Government said that adult Vietnamese could come to Australia if they were the spouses of Australian  citizens, or if they were the: spouses of Vietnamese students who  were being given temporary permits to remain in Australia to  complete their courses of study. In addition^decisions were made in

individual cases where there were Vietnamese adults, whose conduct  - in association with Australians over the years - would have  placed their lives in jeopardy. '  .

Question: In other words they had to have a connection?

Prime Minister: Of course,, yes .  . . . .  .  . .  .  . .  . .  .  . . . . . . . . ^ .  v.. ,  .  .. . .

Question: Last week at the conference you were reported as saying that multinational companies had too much influence and control. I was wondering why you raised it at this conference and whether   you were seeking some Commonwealth initiative?

Prime Minister: I raised the same matter at the conference in Ottawa where I was asked to initiate the discussion on trade   and economic m a t t e r s . I made a reference to this subject in   the same item this time. I wanted to make the point that

international trade was concerned with commodities certainly,  but   it also depended on a very great number of other matters which   militated against the developing countries and in f a c t ,  against   what are regarded as developed countries such as Australia-,

because international trade depends for its infrastructure on   credit facilities, insurance facilities,Â· transport facilities,   and these are in the hands, very largely, of international,  Ã¢ÂÂ

multinational companies. Most of the countries in the Commonwealth,   certainly the developed countries in the Commonwealth,  have   mixed economies, the private sector is predominant and its .   companies very often - usually in fact - multinational companies

- that provide the banking, the insurance and the transport   facilities for international trade. Accordingly, to deal   with international trade in terms of commodities alone is   to deal with only part of international trade.  It maybe that

commodities are the principle preoccupation of Britain among the   developed countries in the Commonwealth. But it would be quite '   absurd for a Head of Government from Canada or Australia or New   Zealand or Singapore, the other developed countries in the   Commonwealth to overlook the aspects of international trade   which turn not on commodities,  but on'banking,  insurance and .

transport.  I should add that I was concerned also, to see that   the discussion turned on increased processing of commodities in   the country of origin, because unquestionably a country's a ;alth  depends very-'Â· largely on the extent to which it is processing   commodities. The countries which produce commodities would be very   much wealthier, the gap between them and the developed countries   would be very much reduced, if they were able to process their

commodities to a greater extent.  There a g a i n ,  international   companies provide so much of the wherewithal for processing. They control, in mixed economies, such matters as technology and   capital. ’

Question: Could I ask you about the British membership of the European Common Market, bearing in mind that the British people   will be voting on the referendum in a month's time. Would you   like to see Britain remain a member of the Market? .

Prime Minister: Yes. I said that a few months ago when I was '

in Britain and when.I was in most of the countries of the   European Economic Community. I said then that there was no   advantage to Australia in Britain withdrawing from the Market, I believe the same has been said by the Prime Minister of Canada   and the Prime Minister of New Zealand, in the Common Market '  !

countries including Britain. During the discussion - the four   days discussions so Ear of the Heads of Government Meeting here -   there hasn't been a single suggestion that it would be. to the   advantage of any of the members for Britain to withdraw from Ã¢ÂÂ

EEC. There have been several statements that it would be to the   advantage of the members if Britain were to remain in the EEC. Tribute was paid by several countries to the skill with which the Wilson Government has renegotiated terms to the advantage of

developing Commonwealth countries. I hesitate to comment on a matter which is primarily Britain's concern but since this matter has arisen in the Heads of Government Meeting, since the matter has been put to me when I have beexi in Britain, I suppose there

is no particular harm in me'giving the same answer as I always have given. There are many matters of political controversy in my country and such is the neurosis of some people who were dragged from the tart shop after 23 years in Government, that ;

there is any basis whatever for criticising my Government, that basis will be exploited ad nausem. It is sufficient to say that my views on Britain remaining in the Common Market haven't produced a ripple of criticism in Australia. I wouldn't lose a ,

single vote in Australia by saying that Britain should remain in the' EEC. None of my opponents, none of my rivals, have seen any advantage for them in saying that I should discourage Britain from staying in,

I should encourage Britaih to get out. This may come as some   surprise to you because it is true that throughout the sixties and   indeed there was an attempt in the seventies, by our opponents   - the previous government to make it difficult for Britain to   join the Common Market. Britain is now in. Everybody accepts that

this is the proper thing and nobody thinks it would be to our   advantage - and I suppose I am at least entitled to express that,   view's on that question - nobody believes that it would be to Australia's   advantage for Britain, to get out of the Common Market. I   believe there are some people in the British Labor Party who -

feel that somehow the social democrat governments who are in

power in Australia, and New Zealand, and Singapore and virtually   in Canada, should somehow rally to the cause of getting Britain   out. The suggestion has been made to all of them. It has been made   for some months.  None of them have responded to the

suggestion.  Perhaps I could warm to the subject by saying.  that   as a person whose ancestors all came from Britain - three-quarters   from England and one-quarter from Scotland - I don’t relish the   thought that England might lapse into the position of Spain

-looking to a mighty empire in the past and a peripheral   influence for the future.

Question: Prime Minister can I revert to your previous question on the Common Market. In view of what you have said Ministers   have in the past, without perhaps a lot of evidence been saying   in Britian that the entire Commonwealth supports Britain’s

continued membership of the European Community.  On the strength   of what you have heard here, from your colleagues and in the  Conference and outside it, would you say that they would be Ã¢ÂÂ   justified in future in continuing to make that claim?

Prime Minister: That the Commonwealth supports Britain's membership of the European Economic Community?

Question: Yes.

Prime Minister: I believe that would be a correct statement. Certainly there has been no statement in the Conference which   would in any way cast doubt on that proposition. On the other hand   it would be quite wrong to say that most people have expressed

a view in favour of Britain remaining in. Most people haven't ,  Â·  Ã¢ÂÂ   spoken on this on the relevant items where this matter would arise.  But everybody who has mentioned it has mentioned it in  two contexts :  that they believe that Britain should remain in

the Market :  secondly, that the Wilson Government has been able _ _  to make very beneficial changes as regards each country itself. -  "

Question: But do you think on that second point that there is likely to be anything in the communique to make that point?

Prime Minister: I don't know. I would certainly support any such statement in the communique.  I think it would be a relevant   feature in the communique and it would be an accurate statement, f

. . ./8

Question:  The fact that Britain has used her membership usefully on behalf of members' of the Commonwealth and their relationship'   with the community? '

Prime Minister: Y e s ,  I believe that that would be an accurate statement and I believe that it would be a relevant contribution   to the communique.  I don't think there can be any doubt that   of all the members of the European Economic Community, none is

in a better place than Britain to speak on behalf of the .

developing countries.  Britain certainly has a very great   deal of experience in these respects and I think Britain's (')

heart is in the right place in these m a t t e r s .

Question: Mr Prime Minister could you explain why your Government is not able to support New Zealand in its efforts to get a .

nuclear free zone i n .the South Pacific?

Prime M i n i s t e r : The matter hasn't arisen.

Question: But I thought it has arisen b e fore,  if not at this .

Conference? -

Prime Minister: It hasn't arisen at this Conference and I'm only concerning myself with matters at this Conference. I'm sorry I can't help you to fabricate any confrontation across the Tasman on this matter. You must be under terrific pressure

from home to substantiate these stories. ^ 0

Question: My question was to explain why Australia does not .  : -

support New Zealand? Ã¢ÂÂ   '

Prime Minister: The matter has not arisen.

Question: What are the implications for Australia's security of the fall of Indo-China to the Communists? Do you feel that that  has been discussed enough at this meeting? And do you still feel  faith in America as an ally for Australia's defence in that area?

Prime Minister:  The matter has scarcely been mentioned in the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting.  The matters which are  given most attention at the Commonwealth Heads of Government  Meeting are the matters which concern several members and  Vietnam has only directly involved .Australia and .New Zealand,.  .  : Â· ' Â· Ã¢ÂÂ  Â·  Â· Â· : Ã¢ÂÂ  Ã¢ÂÂ  Ã¢ÂÂ   We were the only hati'dfis which participated in the civil w a r .

We did so for several years, but our participation was ended in   each case in December 1972. So you can't really expect that ‘  the question would bulk largely at a Commonwealth Meeting. I  would hope that there would be some reference to reconciliation

and reconstruction in Vietnam because that is something in  which most of us could participate,  and I believe,  should particiÂ­ pate. You asked me about America's situation. America has been,  is, and will for many years, as far ahead as any of us can see,  continue to be the greatest military country in the world. . What I think we have to realise is that from now on, America's

commitments will require the support of the Administration   and the Congress. People in the past,  particularly those adopting   the Westminster system, have found it very puzzling, that if a   Government commits itself to something., the Parliament doesn't

support it. But of course, in the American system the President   and the Congress are elected separately and its not: for the first   time you have the situation where they have different points   of view. Quite obviously Wilson and the League of Nations is Â·  one that we all remember from our history. But if the President   and the Congress support a commitment then I have no reason whatÂ­ ever to believe that that commitment would not be effective

in the-circumstances which it contemplated. And as regards the   arrangements between Australia,  New Zealand and the United States   - the ANZUS arrangements - I have never heard any President or any   Congressional leader express any doubts as to the validity and

the relevance of the arrangements.  And I say in that positive   way because from 1967 onwards 1 have on visits to Washington   made a point of ascertaining the views of Congress as far as I  could, as well as the Administration. And therefore I can say

that from the last visit I made to Washington which was last .

September,  Republicans and Democrats, in each house of the Congress',   supported the ANZUS arrangements.  '  I will be seeing these   people as well as the President and the Vice-President next   Wednesday and Thursday,  and I would expect the same situation

to apply. I think we should avoid equating the situation in .  /

South Vietnam with that in any other country in the region. The reason why South Vietnam's Government failed was principally   two-fold. The first was that they never were prepared to test   public opinion. After the General Agreements in 1954 and after

the Paris Accords in 1973, in each case the South Vietnamese   Ã¢ÂÂ   Government refused to carry out the undertakings to have elections,   or to have a broader-based government. That is, they just   wouldn't budge on that aspect. And of course,  they fell.

And the other reason is their situation was seen by their own   citizens to depend on outside support. And no government can   have the respect or support of its population if it is   regarded as depending on outsiders.  However the noble the   motives or however the might the resources of those outsiders,   no government has respect or retains support if it is seen to

depend on outsiders, That situation do e s n ’t apply with any   other country in the region. .  .

Now on Papua New Guinea and Timor, these were only passing   references I made.  Obviously I would be expected to refer to   Papua New Guinea because the Chief Minister on Thursday sent me   a message asking that the Conference should accept Papua New   Guinea's membership of the Commonwealth when she gained independence,   which will be in a few months timeÂ«  That was announced to the

Conference on Thursday and the first business on Friday was   to accept the proposition. Well naturally when I had a few   minutes - I think it was about 10 minutes - at the end on .  .

Friday to'mention a few subjects which I thought ought to be   dealt with in the communique I referred to.this situation. Every member of the Commonwealth has been a British colony with   two exceptions,  there was Western Samoa and now there is Papua Ã¢ÂÂ  New Guinea. So inevitably it is a matter which we should acknowledge-

that a colony and a trust territory of ours should be admitted. Timor was only mentioned in the. context of the Portuguese empire.   After all there are some bits of it, apart from Angola,  Mozambique,   and Cabo Verde.  I would hope later on that there would be some disÂ­ cussion and that.in the communique there would be some reference

to the Indian Oceap because about half the Commonwealth countries   are island or littoral or hinterland States of the Indian Ocean. And several of them have taken initiatives in international   bodies dealing with the Indian Ocean. I think it would be   appropriate for us to refer to them. And the other matter '

which I think ought to be mentioned'is some aspects of disarmament   such as theÂ· comprehensive test ban treaty which is being ' Â·

discussed, or this coming week the review conference on the . nuclear non-proliferation treaty. ,  Ã¢ÂÂ   "

Question: In the Rhodesia question, as you mentioned you are going un to Wahsington and this Conference is much concerned   with pressure on Ian Smith of a practical kind. I’m sure   you will be taking up the chrome problem as part of the '

sanctions tightening when you’re in Washington.  But looking at   the thing more broadly, I wonder if you. could tell us why either   Australia or other countries remote from Rhodesia should be   Ã¢ÂÂ¢  concerned with the problem at this summit.  I mean in what

sense does it drive you to try to get a formula,  why botherÂ» .It certainly would be easier politically just not to worry.

Prime M i n i s t e r :  I agree with the unanimous Commonvtfealth view on c h r o m e .  I wasn't proposing to -raise it in Washington, its   not a matter which is of prime concern to Australia. There   will be very much more important matters for me to discuss in   Washington. Now you mention about Rhodesia, why should it take   up so much time and what are the political m a t t e r s . Rhodesia has concerned people not only in the Commonwealth, but

in the United Nations for quite some time. Its obviously not   a prime consideration so far as Australia is concerned.   Nevertheless Australia has got obligations under United Nations   resolutions. It’ s faithfully discharged those obligations.  :

As regards internal politics I don't say that one gains any   votes in Australia by supporting this question but by the same   token any votes that were going to be lost had been lost a lready. .  And from what I see of the spokesman for Ian Smith i n "Australia '

I would not expect or wish that they vote for us. Externally   it is important that Australia should be known to support   proper principles in this question. Australia cannot afford to   be in the situation in regards to South East Asia or the Indian   or Pacific Oceans thatÂ· South. Africa has got into in Africa. There is no basis for Australia being put in that way, and nobody   should be under ahy impressi.on that, it is. So accordingly \?e   support the attitude which is universally expressed in the   Commonwealth and in the United Nations. '

Question,Â·, Apart from w h a t ’s happened about chrome and New Zealand   and the Tasman S e a . We recognise that history has been made _..-w

in Indo-China in the past week and that yc^u know more than we ’

do that history has been made and that, you yourself have Ã¢ÂÂ

described the United States as the greatest military power in the   world-, has been forced to withdraw from that part of the world. Ã¢ÂÂ

You yourself have boasted that Australia has made a tremendous Ã¢ÂÂ   .

contribution to the humanitarian aftermath of the Vietnam war,. Do you not think that there is not a terrific political vacuum   there which you in Australia may be uniquely placed to fill. .. .

Having talks as you .  do have with President Ford in the United   States in a few days time, do you see yourself as t a k i n g ,an Ã¢ÂÂ

initiative here to bring the nations of that part of the world   together to try to make political headway where there is a 1  '

terrific political vacuum? -  '

.  Prime Mini s t e r : No I w a s n ’t wanting to boast of the huge Â·

humanitarian contribution that we have m a d e .  All that I was .

s a y i n g .is that we have done more than others. I think there   is room for Australia to do more than she has and for others   .  to do more than they have. I am not thinking of taking any

particular initiative or being cast in any such role.  But I do   believe that internatiqnal organisations and various countries, .  preferably through international organisations, ought to. do something about reconciling and rehabilitating this country.

It is quite tragic that of all the old colonies in South East Asia   and in Southern Asia, Indo-China'has had to wait so long for   /"Ã¢ÂÂ ) Ã¢ÂÂ   independence.-Â· There was no earthly reason why South Vietnam, - -

Cambodia and Laos should be in so much worse a position than say, | Â·  the Philippines,  which was emancipated by the United States, I

'  think in ’46, India and Pakistan,  Sri Lanka, Burma which were- Â·

Ã¢ÂÂ   Ã¢ÂÂ   Â·  Ã¢ÂÂ   emancipated in ’47, and- Indonesia which: was emancipated in ?  49 -had to put-up a bit of a struggle to do soÂ·, but it was =- then Malaya

....... r  in 157 and then later on Sarawak, Sabah, Bangladesh - with a .  .

terrific trauma in the case of Bangladesh - all were able to .   get independence.  But in Indo-China for nearly 30 years the   war has continued. And there is no reason whatever why the po-H'.ion   Ã¢ÂÂ¢  of Indo-China should be worse than those of all the other

colonies. Now in those circumstances I believe there is a   very great international obligation to reconcile the people   and reconstruct the country. Ã¢ÂÂ
