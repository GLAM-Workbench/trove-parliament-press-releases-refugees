TONY ABBOTT:

I’m very pleased to be here, we’re almost in the electorate of Forde, we’ve got Burt van Manen, our  candidate for Forde and the owners of this business are voters of Forde and so it’s very good to have them,  it’s very good to see voters in Forde, so it’s very good to have them here, it’s very good to be here. It’s great  to be with Greg Hunt, the Shadow Minister for the Environment. The only downside, of course, is that we  are in the presence of people who have suffered enormous losses because of the grotesque maladministration  of the home insulation programme by the Rudd-Gillard Government.

The maladministration of this programme alone would be sufficient grounds for changing the Government  on the grounds of sheer incompetence. This is the worst managed programme in living memory bar none.  The Government was repeatedly warned that this programme would lead to disaster and they ignored those  warnings. The gang of four, including the then Deputy Prime Minister, now the Prime Minister was  repeatedly warned that this would not work but they pushed on and hasn’t it been a monumental,  comprehensive disaster. 240,000 dodgy or dangerous insulations, 1,000 electrified roofs, almost 200 house  fires and, tragically, four deaths, all arising because the Rudd-Gillard Government just cannot be trusted to  properly execute a programme. As I’ve said before, a Prime Minister can execute a Leader, but she can’t  execute a programme.

What I announce today is that the Coalition will provide additional assistance to some of the unsung victims  of this particular disaster. There were many responsible businesses involved in the insulation sector, many  responsible businesses that expanded to try to deliver this government programme, they have been left high  and dry by the government so today I announce that an extra $30 million from the home insulation  programme allocation will be made available to compensate the businesses that have been left in the lurch  by the Government’s incompetence. It really is a byword for incompetence, I think in the years to come,  home insulation programme, roof batts, will be synonyms for disaster. This is something that should be  weighing heavily on the mind and on the heart of the Prime Minister. Her direct personal involvement in this  monumental disaster and I’m going to ask Greg Hunt just to add to my remarks.

GREG HUNT:

Thanks very much, Tony. If you’d like a metaphor of Labor’s waste, this factory represents, the stores here,  represent what Labors waste has caused. Very simply, we have met businesses all around the country, from  Albury to Bunbury in Sydney and in Melbourne and on the Gold Coast, Sunshine Coast and here in  Brisbane, that have had their livelihoods destroyed. This problem still continues today. Small businesses  continue to suffer. We have numerous homes which have not been inspected and we will fix the mess. So  today’s announcement is very simple. We will expand the compensation for small businesses from $15 to  $45 million, an additional $30 million will be made available, we will expand the criteria to deal with many  of those businesses who have been unable to achieve a satisfactory outcome and we will fix Labor’s mess.

TONY ABBOTT:

Ok, now just before I take questions, I want to just make one further observation. The Labor candidate for  Wannon has let the cat out of the bag about the coming carbon tax. According to the Labor candidate for  Wannon, Julia Gillard has talked openly about the need for a carbon tax and yes, says the Labor candidate  for Wannon, there will be a carbon tax if Labor is elected. This is a tax on your power. This means that  every time you turn on the lights you’ll pay. Every time you open the fridge, you’ll pay. Every time you get  into the shower, you’ll pay and you will pay if this government gets re-elected. I know because the Labor  candidate for Wannon has let the cat out of the bag. I call on the Prime Minister to come clean about the  carbon tax which she’s prepared to talk to with her own candidate, she’s prepared to talk about it with her  own candidates, she needs to come clean with the Australian people about this.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott do you know anything about plans for increased capacity at the Curtin detention centre to 3,000?

TONY ABBOTT:

It wouldn’t surprise me if these are plans the Government has, because the Government has completely lost  control of our borders and that’s why it’s very important we put policies in place to stop the boats. If we  can’t stop the boats, obviously there will have to be all sorts of dire things done, all sorts of new  arrangements to accommodate people to put in place, we have to stop the boats if we are going to avoid all  of this and that’s why it’s so important to have rigorous offshore processing, preferably in a third country  and that’s why if the Prime Minister was serious about this, she would pick up the phone to the President of  Nauru, as I would on day one of an incoming Coalition government.

QUESTION:

Were you aware about two weeks ago that this would be happening? That there would be boosting capacity?

TONY ABBOTT:

The first I have heard about it is this question that you have put to me. But as I said, it wouldn’t at all  surprise me, given that the Government has absolutely lost control of our borders. We’ve got another boat  today. There have been more illegal boat arrivals in the course of just this election campaign than there were  under the Howard Government in the five years from 2002 to 2007.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, a bit of a free kick. Dean Mighell has come out saying there’ll be some bloodletting now in the  Labor Party following Kevin Rudd’s ousting. What’s your response to that?

TONY ABBOTT:

It’s a very good reason not to re-elect this Government. If you want less pork-barrelling, less factionalism  and less leadership tension change the Government. I think Dean Mighell knows the Labor Party very well  and I think it’s pretty clear that a Government going into an election, unable to tell us who the finance  minister would be, unable to say who the defence minister would be, unable to say who the foreign minister  would be is a Government in chaos. They govern in chaos, they’re campaigning in chaos.

QUESTION:

Can you tell us what your surplus will be now that it’s about to be announced, could you tell us as the  Leader?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, I’m going to leave it to my distinguished colleagues Mr Hockey and Mr Robb and I simply point out  that the MYEFO, the PEFO, that the Budget are all handled not by the Prime Minister but by the Treasurer.  So it’s only fair and reasonable that I should leave these important financial announcements to my financial  and economic spokesmen.

QUESTION:

Will you be available after the announcements to answer questions about what they have announced  [inaudible]

TONY ABBOTT:

Obviously I will be available for questioning today. If nothing else, I’ll be available for questioning today by  the people of Brisbane at the community forum coming up. So I don’t think there’ll be any lack of  opportunities to put questions to me.

QUESTION:

Is there any chance that there’ll be an economic debate by Saturday?

TONY ABBOTT:

You know, I went to the ABC last night.

QUESTION:

I know. But is there any chance in the future? I know last night you tried, you failed. I’m completely aware.  Is there any chance that by Saturday there’ll be another economic debate considering the Prime Minister  missed it last night?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, there’s no doubt she did squib it last night. She was sitting on the tarmac at Sydney Airport. For some  reason she flew from Queensland to Sydney, did nothing apparently except sit on the tarmac at Sydney  Airport in panic, trying to decide what to do and then flew off to Perth for what seems to have been just one  public engagement. She’s flying around the countryside without any purpose or direction at the moment.  That seems to be what’s happening. Look, I will do tonight what I said I would do. I will go to the club. I  will face up to the voters of Queensland for one hour. I will answer their questions as honestly as I can, as  directly as I can. I call on the Prime Minister to do likewise.

QUESTION:

4



I’m not suggesting that’s not going to happen. I’m saying an economic debate by Saturday.

TONY ABBOTT:

This whole campaign has been heavily dominated by economic questions and I just make the point that a  Government which can’t manage money has no economic credentials. A Government which wants to slug  our most successful industry has no economic credentials and this is a Government which was lucky enough  to inherit a very strong economic position from its predecessor which it has squandered.

QUESTION:

[Inaudible]

TONY ABBOTT:

We will have a comprehensive superannuation policy and it will be released.

QUESTION:

When you said to us earlier that you were interested in trying to wind back government advertising, does  that go to the extent of [inaudible]

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, I’m not going to make policy on the run but I certainly do want to make it very clear that I am as  revolted as the public are at taxpayer funded political propaganda. It shouldn’t happen. It shouldn’t have  happened under this Government. It shouldn’t ever have happened and it certainly won’t happen if I form a  government after Saturday.
