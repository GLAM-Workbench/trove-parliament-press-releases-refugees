SENATOR ROBERT HILL:

Can I just start by saying how proud we are of our Special Forces. Not only the first rotation, all three rotations. Their period of service in Afghanistan is coming to a close. These men of course receive special awards for gallantry today but they are really, if they don’t mind me saying so, just representative of the whole regiment. They’ve done an extraordinarily good job, shown great courage, achieved their objectives and basically we are now able to withdraw the force from Afghanistan because of their success. They’ve done the job and it’s time therefore to withdraw and to recognise the success that’s been achieved but also the unique contribution of the individuals involved. Now, if you’re wanting to ask them some questions that don’t touch upon operational matters I think they might be prepared to respond.

JOURNALIST:

Signalman Wallace, can I just ask you to cast your mind back to that day on Anaconda when this operation was taking place. Could you just run us through what happened on the day and how you felt during the operation?

WALLACE:

It was fairly detailed, fairly involved. We landed early in the morning. We walked straight into an ambush. They had superior forces and we pretty much got extracted later that night. It was a pretty scary situation to be in.

JOURNALIST:

How many people were there? How many soldiers were involved?

WALLACE:

There were estimates of up to a thousand on the al-Qaeda side and there was around 80 for us.

JOURNALIST:

What sort of weapons were you being fired on with?

WALLACE:

During the day we had rockets, RPGs, mortars, heavy machine guns, small arms fire and there was a Sam Missile also launched.

JOURNALIST:

Did you have any time to think about the risk for you that day?

WALLACE:

Several times yes.

JOURNALIST:

What during what incidents did you (inaudible)?

WALLACE:

Probably the heaviest fighting was around last light where they had managed to dominate both of the ridge lines and launched a ground assault from the north. By the end of that they had set up a machine gun in the south so they had us surrounded and that was probably the scariest part of the whole day.

JOURNALIST:

What were you doing during all this time? What was your task?

WALLACE:

Well my primary task was as a signal officer, a liaison officer to de-conflict between other Australian troops in the area. As a result of the ambush we walked into. It was pretty much a survival situation.

JOURNALIST:

Calling in reinforcements, that kind of thing?

WALLACE:

There was no chance to get reinforcements in.

JOURNALIST: You [inaudible] what do you think got you through?

WALLACE:

Being an Australian I think has got a fair bit to do with it.

JOURNALIST:

What about your training? The SAS really is the elite corps. Did that - did you call upon that training?

WALLACE:

I think that the training we get certainly leaves you very well prepared for that sort of situation.

JOURNALIST:

What did you mean by that comment that being Australian helped you get through it?

WALLACE:

We’ve got a proud tradition on the battle field and it’s up - we’re the current serving members and it’s up to us to uphold that.

JOURNALIST:

Do you think anything in particular swing the course of that battle. You’re saying that at last light they had established control of both ridge lines and had a machine gun nest up there. What in the end enabled yourselves to get out of it?

WALLACE:

I think our ability to fight in the night and air power.

JOURNALIST:

Were you involved in calling in any of that air power?

WALLACE:

Yes.

JOURNALIST:

Are you married? Do you have any family?

WALLACE:

I’m not married no.

JOURNALIST:

Can I just ask Major McDaniel a question about the situation with this ambush? Were you surprised at the ferocity of the enemy force at that time?

McDANIEL:

No, not really. We always expected that they would be a hard enemy to fight. We had expected that before we left, you know, and that was what we found.

JOURNALIST:

What about the fact that it was an ambush given the American capacity to have [inaudible] get intelligence from satellites and various other high tech equipment. To walk into an ambush like that in the modern day. Did that surprise you?

McDANIEL:

Well, planning goes so far and you can only plan with the best information you can with what’s available. There’s a bit of a saying that your plan will only last you until you actually get on the ground. And once that happens then things change fairly rapidly.

JOURNALIST:

Do you rely on your instincts at all in those sort of situations?

McDANIEL:

The blokes do yes. Definitely. I mean they train long and hard and you know as [inaudible] said that prepares them and that certainly prepared them in this case.

JOURNALIST:

Part of your citation is for tactical nous and ability. What sort of tactics did you put into play when this kind of incident, unforeseen incident was occurring.

McDANIEL:

We make it a policy not to discuss tactics, techniques or procedures so I’m afraid I can’t go into that.

JOURNALIST:

Can you give us a clear [inaudible] that there were Australian troops in a couple of places in this battle. Was the ambush here we’re talking about of the SAS surveillance team or was Mr Wallace with the Coalition forces?

McDANIEL:

Well, Martin was attached to US forces at the time. As you mentioned he was attached to provide communications and to - in order to de-conflict. You know there were quite a lot of forces as you are aware around that area at the time and it was important that we were all coordinated and we all knew where each other were and that was basically Martin’s job.

SENATOR ROBERT HILL:

I think we better let them go and have some morning tea with their families.

JOURNALIST:

Minister, are you confident that these blokes will do us proud in the next conflict that they’re called on to be in?

SENATOR ROBERT HILL:

They always do us proud. They’re not called upon for any other conflict at this time.

JOURNALIST:

But they’re ready and able to go in your view?

SENATOR ROBERT HILL:

They’re always ready and able to go. And I think that their record in Afghanistan is yet, is just another illustration of their capabilities, their courage, as one of them said their nous and they can achieve extraordinary things.

JOURNALIST:

And the American’s have said they’d like them along side in any future conflict?

SENATOR ROBERT HILL:

They’ve received great credit from all of our coalition colleagues for what they’ve achieved in Afghanistan.

JOURNALIST:

How can ordinary Australians express their thanks for their work?

SENATOR ROBERT HILL:

I think there’s lots of ways. Basically it’s not just the Special Forces. They are representative of the ADF as a whole. We seek to recognise their achievements through giving them good conditions of service, proper public recognition when they do well as is being experienced here today. Basically the Australian community is very proud of our Defence Force and there’s lots of ways in which they can show that.

JOURNALIST:

But you’ve called on people to send messages to forces serving overseas?

SENATOR ROBERT HILL:

We do at Christmas for example. They do appreciate, when they’re away at Christmas, messages from ordinary Australian’s saying that they are thinking of them. A lot of forces will be away this Christmas. A lot of families will be separated. It’s a special time in which we recognise what they are doing and what their families are sacrificing to enable them to protect our country.

JOURNALIST:

Minister the very nature of their work is covert and secret to a large extent. How important is it for the Australian public to know a little bit about what they’re exactly doing?

SENATOR ROBERT HILL:

Well I think it is quite important because if the Australian public doesn’t know they will never quite receive recognition that is representative of what they do achieve. So to the extent to which that can be made public, consistent with operational restraints and in some instances protection of particular individuals, we’ll do so. And we ask the Army to make that decision and in this instance they are able to name four individuals. And we all have the opportunity to share with them and their family this, really this day of celebration.

JOURNALIST:

Are you thinking of enhancing their capability with new equipment? There’s been some discussion they could use some new communications and other equipment. Is that part of the strategic review?

SENATOR ROBERT HILL:

We’ve been continuing to enhance their capability but what we’re really now talking about is extending that capability further across the Defence Force and Army in particular. Not surprisingly the Special Forces tend to get the - tend to be first in line for new capabilities. We’re now wanting to ensure that others within the Army have similar capabilities.

JOURNALIST:

Will you give us an idea of what sort of capabilities you’ll be extending through the Army? What sort of types equipment etc?

SENATOR ROBERT HILL:

Well we’ve been talking about new direct fire weapons. Ultimately new indirect fire weapons as well. It’s a whole suite of capabilities.

JOURNALIST:

Can you comment on reports that the Collins Class budget has blown out by another $200 million because you need to modify the boats for heavier US torpedoes?

SENATOR ROBERT HILL:

Well that’s really a misrepresentation. What’s happening is that we’re planning a new torpedo. The next

generation of torpedoes, yet to be developed actually, but will be at the time it comes into operation the best torpedo of its type in the world and we’re planning for that. It has the same physical dimensions as the existing torpedoes and is slightly heavier and we’re doing a study at the moment to provide us with a detailed integration plan into the boats. Obviously as you continue to upgrade capability, whether it’s the new combat system that we’ve already announced or the new torpedoes that we hope to get in the future, that clearly costs money. But I think there’s a failure on the part of some to understand that whether it’s aircraft or whether it’s ships or submarines, there is a need for ongoing capability upgrades in order to remain competitive and that’s obviously going to cost money.

JOURNALIST:

You’ve not throwing good money after bad?

SENATOR ROBERT HILL:

No, no they are very capable submarines now with the new combat system they’ll be even more capable and ultimately with new torpedoes it’s a further enhancement.

JOURNALIST:

Are you confident the combat system will work within the budget guidelines you’ve set?

SENATOR ROBERT HILL:

Yeah, it’s an existing ... Well fully worked in terms of achieving - giving us the capability that we’re seeking yes. And I say that from the basis that it’s primarily an existing combat system within the US nuclear submarine fleet. Obviously it’s continuing to be upgraded because that’s, as I said, the way of these things. So it’ll be the latest version of that Raytheon system and it will give us an extra capability.

JOURNALIST:

Senator Hill do you think you’ll know how much money Treasurer Costello may allocate to Defence in today’s mid year economic review?

SENATOR ROBERT HILL:

Well no that’s really a review as you say rather than looking at the...

JOURNALIST:

Well it seems that Defence will be the only ...

SENATOR ROBERT HILL:

Well we need - we obviously have to maintain existing operations and that costs money. Because we are using the Force so intensely at the moment that’s further maintenance and support costs. We do need to continue to maintain capability upgrades. So that is the level of intensity, the operational tempo at the moment is expensive to maintain and all alliance parties within the coalition at the moment fighting the war against terror are experiencing the same pressures.

JOURNALIST:

What do you think about Labor’s plans for a half billion Coast Guard or is the Navy up to that job?

SENATOR ROBERT HILL:

Well that seems to be a re-run of one of the few policies that Mr Beazley took to the last election. To us it’s just adding another layer of buearacracy and extra administrative costs. That’s what we’re trying to avoid. We’re trying to get the money into the sharp end. Already we’re committed to a new fleet of patrol boats. Final bids

are in to my Department and within the next few months we’ll be announcing a successful winner. That’s new patrol boats supported through the ADF with its maritime surveillance capabilities and complemented by Customs resources in terms of their vessels and also their aircraft. That provides us with an effective maritime and air patrol force that’s proven to be extraordinarily successful. So why would you seek to re-name capabilities, spend more money on administration, and end up with no better asset?

JOURNALIST:

To prevent frigates intercepting refugee boats?

SENATOR ROBERT HILL:

Well primarily that work is done by our patrol boats. They are supplemented on occasions by frigates and that gives us the capability, it gives us the capacity to purchase ships that are capable of a range of different options. If you go down market so to speak and buy smaller, less capable ships you won’t have that range of capabilities that a Force like ours needs.

JOURNALIST:

Minister on Iraq, are you a supporter of the argument that you don’t need to go back to the UN to have a strike on Iraq if they fail the test.

SENATOR ROBERT HILL:

Well on Iraq our focus at the moment is to achieve the outcome that we seek which is the disarming of Iraq of its weapons of mass destruction through peaceful means, through the United Nations process. The inspectors are now going back in. Iraq’s got I think until about the 8th of December to publish its list of weapons of mass destruction. I hope it will do so honestly and I hope it will accept the demands of the international community as a whole - that it end its weapons program and that it destroy the capabilities that it already has.

JOURNALIST:

So would you like the UN to specifically sanction a strike?

SENATOR ROBERT HILL:

Well I’m pleased that we, the international community, went back through the UN process and that the response to the continual breaches by Iraq of UN resolutions is a collective response. A UN Security Council-sanctioned response. And it’s on that basis that the weapons of mass - the inspectors are going back in and that the international community has a chance to see this matter resolved through peaceful means. So rather than speculate on what might happen on the event of breach, I think at the moment the emphasis has got to be on taking full benefit from the collective UN course that we and others within the international community are wedded to.

JOURNALIST:

Minister, several medals weren’t awarded publicly today for security reasons. Does that signal the fact that we’re looking at using the SAS in a covert role in potential future conflicts?

SENATOR ROBERT HILL:

Well, are you asking me to speculate but they - for good reason on occasions we don’t identify particular individuals in terms of their personal security and in terms of operational matters. And we rely of course upon the ADF to distinguish those that we can celebrate publicly and those that we have to acknowledge without meeting them.

JOURNALIST:

Are we now looking to the SAS ...

SENATOR ROBERT HILL:

It’s got nothing to do with any - it’s not - there’s no change in the operational doctrine for the Special Forces.

JOURNALIST:

Does that mean we don’t use them in a covert role?

SENATOR ROBERT HILL:

Well we don’t talk about their operational …

JOURNALIST:

But you’ve previously said that we haven’t ...

SENATOR ROBERT HILL:

Well I don’t talk about their operational boundaries. If you get somebody else to do so good luck to you. Okay thanks.
