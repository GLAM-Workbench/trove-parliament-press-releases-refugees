THE HON RICHARD MARLES MP  SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND BORDER  PROTECTION  MEMBER FOR CORIO





STATEMENT



Baby Asha’s care at the Lady Cilento Hospital and more broadly, must be in  accordance with the treating doctors’ advice.

The Government needs to handle this matter with sensitivity and on the basis that  Australia has an obligation in respect of the safety of all refugees and asylum  seekers in its direct and indirect care, both in Australia and offshore.

The Government must give an assurance to the Australian community that it is  caring for baby Asha in this way.
