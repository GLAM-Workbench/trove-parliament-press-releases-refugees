FAREWELLING AFP DEPLOYMENT TO  AFGHANISTAN

QUESTION:   This, I presume is entirely a voluntary exercise is it [indistinct] volunteers to  go?

TONY NEGUS:         Yes it is and in fact for about six positions we had over 600 applicants  within the AFP who were quite prepared and willing to go and do this. They see it as very  exciting, very challenging and very worthwhile work.

QUESTION:   There's certainly a new series on [indistinct] and developing theories are to get  right in among the people to try to win over the people and that obviously involves a level of  exposure by [indistinct].              In the work that these men are going to be doing, do you see them operating cheaply  inside the wire in their training or out in communities, you know, on the ground [indistinct]?

TONY NEGUS:         The role of these members who will perform and the other people we  have in Afghanistan is very much that training the Afghan National Police from the ground  up. To start with, that will involved inside the wire training at Tarin Kowt, at the training  centre, and they won't be outside in the broader communities at this stage.

QUESTION:   [Inaudible]…within the Afghan National Police force?

TONY NEGUS:         Well as I've said earlier, we've trained around 500 staff so far and those  early training initiatives look positive, but there is a lot of work still yet to do and we're  starting from a relatively low base, levels of education, levels of police proficiency over there  aren't particularly what you'd expect them in a developed country, so at the moment we're  actually starting and looking at the basics of policing and working from there.

QUESTION:   So commissioner, sorry, does that mean that they're not allowed to travel  outside the wire of Tarin Kowt base at all? That's part of the rules of engagement [inaudible]?

TONY NEGUS:         Well the rules of engagement are that the work that they conduct will  be within Tarin Kowt, yes. We work with the military over there, so we don't rule anything  out and we don't necessarily give away all the details of the work we would do, but certainly  their security is the paramount objective of the AFP in making sure that they're performing  their duties in a safe way.



QUESTION:   Do you envisage us spending any time outside the wire in the course of the  next six month deployment?

TONY NEGUS:         Look, not as a matter of course, no, but we don't as I said rule anything  out, and we're continuing to work on what the next phase of this training development will  need to be.

QUESTION:   Minister, are you seeing improvements in the police? The Afghan police are  traditionally notoriously corrupt in the field. [Indistinct]…

TONY NEGUS:         Well as I said, we're starting from a relatively low base. We've trained  500 officers so far. This will involve ongoing mentoring as well as the initial training. And as  I said, look, we have to start from the ground up with the Afghan National Police.               They're showing a willingness to participate in the training and to listen to what we've  got to say, so we think it's an important component of building a civilian platform that can  actually sustain the country going forward.

QUESTION:   Does that mean - are you able at all to… you say, ongoing mentoring. But are  you able to measure, you know, after they graduate from the program, are you able to  measure any progress they make?               Or is it just a case of there you go.



TONY NEGUS:         Well we're continuing to develop the training packages as we go.               What we have done in the past is have them come back to the training centre, and  actually - and measure, work through briefs of evidence with them and help them in their  ongoing development. But as I said at the moment our activities are contained to within the  provincial training centre at Tarin Kowt.               And therefore we are not out in the field with them undertaking investigations on a  day to day basis.

QUESTION:   Can you bring us up to date with what is the narcotics situation in Afghanistan  at the moment? The degree of control that the central authorities have over what is grown?

TONY NEGUS:         Well look, it's a very difficult question to answer in a few words. I  mean, obviously, Afghanistan continues to be one of the major hubs in the world of growing  opium. We still continue to work with our international partners on looking at trafficking  routes out of Afghanistan.               And again that is a significant part of what we do in collecting criminal intelligence  through Afghanistan, and working with the local police to counter that narcotic trafficking.

QUESTION:   Does it limit the ability of these officers to mentor and train if they can't  actually go out to, out on jobs with the Afghan National Police?

TONY NEGUS:         Look, ideally, mentoring and capacity building is done in the field, but  we have to be realistic about the security situation here. The primary objective of the AFP is  to provide the training in a safe environment for our own members, and we'll continue to  reassess that, and as conditions improve, we haven't ruled out looking at different ways of  actually conducting that training. But at the moment, the security environment is just not such

that we could be with them in the field.

QUESTION:   Given that low basis you talked about, what kind of commitment in terms of  [indistinct]?

TONY NEGUS:         Look, that's very difficult to assess. The government's committed for  another two years in funding for that, and again we'll continue to look at how things develop  in Afghanistan.

QUESTION:   Minister, could I ask you a question. You said it just before in your formal  address, that the aim is to have a transition to Afghan authorities as soon as conditions allow.  If the conditions are such that these trainers are unlikely to be able to go outside of the wire  because of security issues, it's going to be a long time is it not?

BRENDAN O'CONNOR:     That's something that we have to assess as we go forward. The  Australian Government is committed to winning the war and securing the peace in  Afghanistan. We need to ensure we do everything we can. And it's critical that we have both  a civilian and military strategy, and that's why the role of the AFP here is so important.               But we'll assess and monitor the capacity for the Afghan Government to take over  further - take further responsibility, take greater sovereignty, if you like, as we go forward.  And that will be - and we'll assess that properly and respond accordingly.

QUESTION:   But you addressed the Australian people on this matter, will it be false to give  them a false expectation that this is going to be up and down, wrapped up, that this is -  progress is happening at such a pace that we can step back from it, you know, in a matter of

months or a year or two.

BRENDAN O'CONNOR:     We've made a commitment in relation to the AFP's role for two  years, and will be upfront with the Australian people about any changes that occur in  Afghanistan.               But of course, we do hold hope to have the transition to the Afghan people, the  responsibility to govern their own country, as quickly as possible. But we have to be realistic  - and that has to be based on facts. But that is our ultimate goal - in relation to this matter.

QUESTION:   And you think that conditions have been made more difficult by the lack of  legitimacy that's now attached to the presidency of Hamid Karzai, that… claims that he  defrauded, engaged in defrauding the last election, suggestions he was erratic - at worst, that  this is, makes it harder to get that political legitimacy [indistinct]…

BRENDAN O'CONNOR:     I think there are challenges in Afghanistan. We recently  witnessed the President of the United States raise such issues with the President of  Afghanistan, and indeed we need to continue to assess those challenges, but ultimately, as I

said earlier, it's important that we do not allow this country to become a haven again for  terrorists so they can launch attacks on us or our friends.               And that's why it's critical that the Australian Defence Force and the Australian  Federal Police and other Australian agencies, along with the international coalition, do their  very best to win the war and secure the peace.

QUESTION:   Commissioner, just changing subjects very briefly. Can you tell us what  progress the AFP has made in the hunt for [indistinct], whose been on the run now for about a  month. And do your investigators believe that he's still in the country? Or are there concerns  that he may have skipped the country?

TONY NEGUS:         Yeah, Paul, as you can appreciate, that's an ongoing investigation. I  really wouldn't like to comment on any progress or otherwise we've made. He is still at large.  We are still continuing investigations into his location. But again - I wouldn't like to discuss  in any detail where that's got to.

QUESTION:   Minister, is the - according to police, are they on the same terms and  conditions comparable to members of the Defence Force?

BRENDAN O'CONNOR:     I might ask the Commissioner to answer that if it's… or Frank  Prendergast.

FRANK PRENDERGAST:   Thank you. The deployed police are on terms and conditions  which are comparable to other Australian police deployed overseas. It's part of a special  determination in relation to overseas' service.               As to its parity with Defence Force, I can't speak authoritatively on that.               But I would say the roles are different. The expectations of the members are different,  and the type of people we're deploying, the terms they're deploying on are different.

QUESTION:   Minister. If you say that the conditions in Afghanistan are still problematic,  then why are Visa applications from asylum seekers coming from Afghanistan being  delayed?

BRENDAN O'CONNOR:     We made a decision on 9 April to suspend the review of asylum  claims for six months in relation to the Afghani asylum seekers on the basis of advice - and  the fact is there are issues that need to be considered in relation to Afghanistan.               In determining whether someone has a genuine claim for asylum we need to consider  whether they have a well-founded fear of persecution. That of course is a different standard, a  different test to the one that we might apply to certain parts of Afghanistan.

But this is something we are considering, and we will make a determination anytime  between now and up to six months.

QUESTION:   Could people acting out of humanitarian motives be caught up with the  proposed anti-people smuggling laws?

BRENDAN O'CONNOR:     The Anti-People Smuggling and Other Measures bill is an  important bill. It is intended to deter people from providing material support to people  smuggling activities.               Let's remember that organised syndicates are involved in exploiting people who are in  some cases desperate. They are looking to rob them of their life savings, place them on  dangerous boats - many - some of which sink. We need to make sure we do everything we  can to dismantle organised syndicates in transit countries, and we're doing that in the case of  Indonesia with the help of the Indonesian National Police.               We have to ensure we deter people from providing material support. That's the intent  of the legislation. We know money is the lifeblood of organised crime - whether it be people  smuggling or other forms of organised crime.               And if we can cut the flow of money we can certainly cripple the criminal syndicates  that are involved in what is a pernicious activity.

QUESTION:   Minister, is it [indistinct] say whether or not you knew these arrangements had  any impact on [indistinct]?

BRENDAN O'CONNOR:     I think the Minister for Immigration made clear, it is too early to  make a full assessment. The Minister for Immigration also made clear at the time of the  announcement that we didn't expect to see the end of the vessels that might arrive in our  waters. But you know, we're monitoring the situation and we believe it was the right decision  to make, and we will assess the effect of the decision when we're in a position to properly  consider all of the information we have at this point - though it is too early to make a - to  draw a conclusion as a result of the announcement.

QUESTION:   Commissioner Negus, are Federal Police involved in any way in the  Melbourne Storm fraud investigation?

TONY NEGUS:         No, not at this time, we're not involved, no.

BRENDAN O'CONNOR:     Thank you ladies and gentlemen.
