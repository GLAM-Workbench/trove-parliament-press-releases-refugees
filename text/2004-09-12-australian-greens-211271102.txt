Greens national campaign - off to  a sunny start  12th Sep 04

The Greens are on track to exceed one million votes in this election,  Greens Senator Bob Brown said today at the party’s national  election campaign launch in Melbourne.

“Friday’s Morgan poll putting the Greens on 10.5% nationally has  boosted the chances of electing three to four new Senators and  holding Michael Organ’s seat of Cunningham, with the potential for  a breakthrough in the House of Representatives seats of Melbourne  and Sydney,” Senator Brown said.

“The Greens’ policies are attracting voters because they offer  Australia a sunny future, focus on education and health before tax  cuts, and enable us to play a constructive role in our own Asia  Pacific neighbourhood,” he said.

Initiatives announced at the launch include:  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ a ten-year, $1 billion, 300 000 solar roofs program which would  see 5% of all houses with solar panels by the end of the decade and  a booming solar industry, paid for by redirecting and extending the  government’s already announced  $500 million ‘low emission fund’;  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ a Commonwealth-led plan to provide properly for over 6 000  young people with severe disabilities, currently forced to live in  nursing homes for lack of appropriate facilities;  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ increased funding for the ABC and SBS, restoring resources to the  levels of the mid-1980s and enabling the ABC to be a leader in the  digital revolution;  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ putting a lid on excessive executive payouts by capping tax  deductibility at ten times average annual earnings (currently $49  000 per annum); and  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ returning Reconciliation with Indigenous Australians to the  national agenda.

“Priorities for the Greens in this election are to save Tasmania’s  iconic forests, to get asylum seekers out from behind the razor wire,  see 3000 gigalitres of water per annum put back into the Murray  Darling and see Australia become a leader in tackling climate  change with major business spin-offs,” Senator Brown said.

“The Greens alone are committed to restoring public health and  public education to excellence before spending on tax cuts.  These  should be a priority in considering the budget surplus.

“We will be standing candidates in all House of Representative seats  and Senate teams in each state and territory so everybody has the  choice to vote Green.

“The signs are that a good one in ten voters will do just that,” said  Senator Brown.
