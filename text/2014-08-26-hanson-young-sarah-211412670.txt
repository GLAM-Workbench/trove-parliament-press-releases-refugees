Christmas Island compensation case shows suffering

A claim for compensation that was lodged in the Victorian Supreme Court today on  behalf of refugee children locked up on Christmas Island shows that the government’s  cruelty has gone too far, the Australian Greens have said.

“Instead of destroying children and being forced to pay compensation, the Abbott  government should release them into the community immediately,” the Greens’  immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.

“Spending years behind bars damages children beyond repair and this case should be  the wakeup call that the government needs.

“Children on Christmas Island and Nauru are suffering unimaginable harm at the hands  of the Abbott government. The Human Rights Commission inquiry has revealed  shocking and unacceptable government cruelty towards children in detention over recent  weeks.

“By ignoring the warning signs, the Australian Government is making the tax payer liable  for millions of dollars in potential payments.

“Every day that these children remain locked up is another day that they are irreversibly  damaged. All children must be released from Australian immigration prisons  immediately, before more damage is done.”
