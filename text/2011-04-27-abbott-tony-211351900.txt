TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I think it’s very important that workers right around Australia understand that this carbon tax won’t  clean up the environment but it will clean out their wallets and it will wipe out jobs, big time. It’s interesting  that the AWU in South Australia said a week or so back that Whyalla would become a ghost town under the  carbon tax, so would Port Pirie. There are almost 4,000 jobs in Whyalla directly dependent upon the steel  industry, as we know because the OneSteel and the BlueScope chiefs have told us. They think this carbon  tax is economic vandalism that will very seriously damage, if not destroy, steel making in this country.

NAOMI WOODLEY:

But the Government says there will be significant compensation for steel. Aren’t you spreading fear before  the full facts of this debate are known?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I don’t think you can trust the Government. It’s also the first anniversary of the dumping of Kevin  Rudd’s emissions trading scheme, his version of the carbon tax. Now, the now Prime Minister was saying  then that this tax has got to be dumped. Now, of course, she is telling us that it is necessary to save the  world. Well, I just don’t think people can trust the Prime Minister. Kevin Rudd couldn’t trust her then and  the public can’t trust her now.

NAOMI WOODLEY:

But didn’t the CPRS debate show that this is a complex area and why shouldn’t the Government now be  taking a considered approach to developing this new policy?

TONY ABBOTT:

Naomi, what it showed was that Australia should not try to save the world on its own. Now, all of us want to  do the right thing by the environment. The Coalition has a strong and effective policy to reduce emissions by  planting more trees, getting better soil and using smarter technology but what we don’t want is to damage

Australian’s cost of living by putting up the price of power and fuel and to destroy our manufacturing  industry by making it uncompetitive with manufacturing overseas and that’s why we should not, repeat not,  be embracing this toxic tax.

NAOMI WOODLEY:

You flew into South Australia from Christmas Island. It was your first visit there as I understand it. What  were your impressions on the standard of the detention facilities there?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think they were variable. I mean, obviously the main Christmas Island detention centre is a purpose built  facility that the Howard Government built and the current Government said it was a white elephant at the  time, even though they’ve stacked the numbers in there. Look, the basic problem is that the Government has  lost control of our borders and the changes announced yesterday are a weak response to problems of the  Government’s own making. They are not going to stop the boats and they are not going to end the protests.

NAOMI WOODLEY:

Did you have any opportunity to speak to asylum seekers?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, it was fairly brief interactions because they were all going about their ordinary business of the day.  The basic problem here and look, we can talk about conditions in the centres and obviously in a perfect  world they could always be otherwise but as long as the boats keep coming, we will have a serious problem  and if the Government is serious about fixing the problem, they won’t just belatedly confess to failure three  years down the track, they won’t just say ‘oh let’s have temporary protection visas for a few troublemakers’,  everyone who comes illegally by boat will have a temporary visa. The troublemakers won’t get temporary  stays in Australia, they’ll get detention followed by deportation and the Government should pick up the  phone to the President of Nauru because that’s the only third country processing centre that we are ever  going to get. They should finally give the East Timor proposal the decent burial that it’s needed ever since  the Prime Minister first announced it.

NAOMI WOODLEY:

But did you not think it would be instructive in the current debate to sit down in a more formal sense with  some asylum seekers to learn more about why they choose to take the route that they have to get to  Australia?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, everyone knows that there are millions and millions of people who would love to come to Australia if  the welcome mat is put out for them, who would love to come to Australia illegally if the people smugglers  have a product to sell and this is what the Government must do; it must immediately remove the product that  the people smugglers currently have to sell and temporary protection visas for troublemakers is not  punishing people, it’s rewarding people and the boats will keep coming if the Government’s policies don’t  dramatically change.
