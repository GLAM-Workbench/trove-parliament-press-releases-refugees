PRESS RELEASE Ã¢ÂÂ i-7. 6 December 1978

DR. MOSS CASS, OPPOSITION SPOKESMAN ON IMMIGRATION, AND

ETHNIC AFFAIRS .

The Federal Government should consider offering financial

assistance to Vietnam in an effort to stem the flood of .  Vietnam

refugees who are being forced to leave/ because of the dis-asterous state of the economy.

Ã¢ÂÂ   '  . Â·  Oh. i , '  ' Ã¢ÂÂ  ' Ã¢ÂÂ  Ã¢ÂÂ  Ã¢ÂÂ   Ã¢ÂÂ   Ã¢ÂÂ   '  Ã¢ÂÂ   ,  Ã¢ÂÂ

The alternative for Australia is a massive unplanned influx .

of refugees.

This policy was discussed and approved by a. meeting of Labor

Ministers and Shadow Ministers for Immigration and Ethnic

Affairs in Sydney last Friday. Further discussions will take

place within the party with the intention of having the idea

approved as official A.L.P. policy. .

Under such a scheme,  any aid given to assist the Vietnamese

Government would be on the condition that the Government no

longer resorted, either actively or passively, to emigration

as a solution to the nation's problems.  ,

The initiative should be discussed with all U. N." 'member nations

to gain-/Financial assistance from other sources.

The cost of direct aid to Vietnam will be far less than the

long-term economic and social costs resulting from a flood

of refugees into Australia.
