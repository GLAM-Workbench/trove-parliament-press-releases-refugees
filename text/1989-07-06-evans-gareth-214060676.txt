Australian aid for Red Cross operations in Indonesia

Border crossers returning to the Indonesian province of Irian Jaya from  Papua New Guinea are to benefit from a $400,000 grant to a program run  by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), the Minister for  Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Gareth Evans, announced in Brunei  today.

Senator Evans welcomed the Indonesian Government’s approval for the  ICRC program.

"Australia's contribution will assist approximately 300 returnees in 1989,  all of whom are currently settled in temporary border camps. A further  600 border crossers are expected to return under the ICRC program in  1990," Senator Evans said.

"The ICRC program will assist the safe return of the border crossers and  contribute to their basic welfare needs," Senator Evans said.

PNG has been host to border crossers since 1984 with about 12,000  currently inside the country. Senator Evans noted that Australia has been  the principal donor to a United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees  program which assists border crossers in PNG camps, providing $4.9

million since 1983/84.

Australian assistance to ICRC's work in Indonesia forms part of the  Government's overseas aid program administered by the Australian  International Development Assistance Bureau (AIDAB).
