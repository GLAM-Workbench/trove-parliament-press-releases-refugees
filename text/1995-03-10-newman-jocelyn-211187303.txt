NEWS RELEASE FROM

SHADOW MINISTER FOR DEFENCE

10 March 1995

THE UNGUARDED REPUBLIC

The Prime Minister is in Europe proclaiming that Australia must become a  republic to be taken seriously by the international community.

A country that cannot guard its own borders against illegal immigrants or  unwanted visitors has little chance of being taken seriously by the rest of the  world, republic or not!

The latest boat people to arrive in Darwin were not spotted until they were five  kilometres off shore.

And then, they were only noticed by an off-duty Coastwatch officer who 'was in  the right place at the right time' according to Coastwatch.

Mr Keating should stop holding court in the capitals of Europe, come home  and join the joggers, passing motorists and off-duty Coastwatch personnel  along our northern coastline to defend 'proud and independent' Australia.
