GREAT NEWS FOR NHILL’S KAREN COMMUNITY SAYS BROAD

The Member for Mallee, Andrew Broad, yesterday enthusiastically

announced that the funding he has been lobbying for, to support the

continued growth of employment for the Karen community in Nhill, has been

confirmed.

“This is a fantastic outcome both for the Karen community and for the town of

Nhill, which has embraced the Karen people and been rewarded with growth

and vibrancy.

“The Karen resettlement is, as I have often said, a wonderful migration

success story and I firmly believed as a Government, we needed to provide

support so that the success could continue.

“Together, Nhill and the Karen community clearly demonstrate what is

possible when refugees are welcomed into towns.”

The commitment from the Federal Government, which is being matched by

the Hindmarsh Shire, will allow for the salary over two years, of a Migration

Employment Coordinator.

It is expected that this position will support another 50 Karen workers and

through them, support the anticipated growth of the local business, Luv a

Duck, which has expanded due to the increased workforce, courtesy of the

Karen community.

“I couldn’t be prouder of this Wimmera town and I am delighted to be able to

share this announcement today.

“Nhill once more has a bright future, full of potential and colour,” Mr. Broad

said.
