ARREST OF ALLEGED PEOPLE SMUGGLER POSES MANY CRUCIAL  QUESTIONS

The Hon Dr Sharman Stone MP

Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship

Allegations that an asylum seeker was charged with people smuggling shortly after being forcibly returned to his

country by Australian authorities raises serious questions about the effectiveness of processing by the

Department of Immigration.

If these reports are correct and the person is a smuggler, Minister Evans and his Immigration Department have

failed to detect this person’s criminal activity and it places their security checking procedures into serious

question.

If the person is not a people smuggler, but a genuine asylum seeker in need of Australia’s protection, his return to

Sri Lanka implies the Department’s processing is seriously defective.

There are a series of critical questions that Minister Evans must now answer:   1.) What communications or intelligence exchange did Australian officials have with Sri Lankan officials about the  identity and character of this person?

2.) Were Australian officials told this person was an alleged people smuggler?

3.) If so, why wasn’t he charged in Australia?

4.) If Australian officials do not believe this person is a people smuggler or a refugee, what assurances did they

seek in regards to the man’s safety in Sri Lanka?

Minister Evans must demand an urgent investigation into this matter. If mistakes have been made then

processes must be put in place to see that it does not happen again.

Either way the integrity of Australia’s border protection and reputation will be further weakened.
