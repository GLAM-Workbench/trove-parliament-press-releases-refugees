MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS

The Hon Julie Bishop MP

20 July 2016



WASHINGTON DC VISIT

I will represent Australia at the first joint Counter-ISIL Coalition Foreign and Defence  Ministers’ meetings in Washington on 21 July. I will be joined by my colleague, the Minister  for Defence Marise Payne.

This meeting comes at a critical juncture as the Counter-ISIL Coalition intensifies the effort to  defeat ISIL at its source.

In addition to the Coalition meeting, I will also meet with my Foreign Minister counterparts  including UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, Iraqi Foreign Minister Ibrahim al-Ja’afari and  Dutch Foreign Minister Bert Koenders. I will also meet with US Special Presidential Envoy for  the Global Coalition, Brett McGurk. Discussions will focus on accelerating the effort to defeat  ISIL in Iraq and Syria, as well as the need to tackle ISIL’s global networks.

I will also take part in a panel discussion with leaders of the international security community  on the importance of intelligence sharing and cooperation in the fight against ISIL.

As part of Australia’s ongoing commitment to peace and stability in Iraq I will announce that  Australia will provide a further $15 million in humanitarian and stabilisation assistance. This  will include $5 million to clear landmines from civilian areas, $5 million for the World Food  Programme for urgent food relief, $3 million for UN High Commissioner for Refugees, and $2  million for the UN Iraq Humanitarian Pooled Fund.

This additional assistance brings Australia’s humanitarian response to the Iraq crisis to  $60 million since 2014. Since 2011, Australia has also provided $213 million in response to the  Syrian crisis, and we have committed a further $220 million for humanitarian relief in Syria  and neighbouring countries over the next three years.
