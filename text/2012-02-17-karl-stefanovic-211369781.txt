KARL STEFANOVIC:

Mr Abbott, good morning to you.

TONY ABBOTT:

Good morning, Karl.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

Wayne Swan says you are licking your lips over these job losses. Are you?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, these job losses are a disaster for the workers and I fear they are a bad sign for the future and my  problem is that government policy is in many instances making a bad situation worse. I know the carbon tax  is not the only factor in these Qantas job losses, in these Alcoa job questions, but the carbon tax certainly is  impacting on Qantas. The carbon tax bill that Qantas will pay is $110 million a year and that’s about four  times their current tax bill.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

You were nonetheless quick to blame the carbon tax on the announcement of Qantas job cuts. The Prime  Minister had this to say in Question Time yesterday:

JULIA GILLARD:

For the Leader of the Opposition to say that these job losses today have been caused by putting a price on  carbon is wholly untrue and once again contemptuous of the workers involved.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

Tony, are job losses becoming part of your political campaign? It's a bit low, isn't it?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, Karl, it’s important that governments don't make a bad situation worse. I obviously accept that there  are a range of factors at work here - the high Aussie dollar is important, in some cases difficult workplace  relations situations are playing their part. But when it comes to manufacturing industry, when it comes to the  transport sector, the carbon tax is a problem and the Prime Minister is in denial about the impact of the  carbon tax on jobs. As one of the very senior figures, John Hannagan from the aluminium industry said just  yesterday: the best thing you can do for the aluminium industry is put the carbon tax on hold.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

The thing is about all of this, it needs to be kept in perspective wouldn't you agree? These job losses, rightly  so, grab the headlines, but the jobless rate fell to 5.1 per cent which means there are more Australians at  work today than any other time in the country's history. Doesn't it need to be kept in perspective? Things are  not that bad.

TONY ABBOTT:

And yet if you also look at the statistics, it shows that last year, 2011, was the first year in 20 years, two  decades, with no jobs growth. So, look, the statistics for one month were ok, but the statistics for the whole  year were pretty dire.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

The statistics for the month were exceptional. I mean 60,000 more jobs created is pretty good when you look  at the world economy at the moment.

TONY ABBOTT:

Of course, one month's figures were good. No doubt about that. But let's look at the whole of 2011: no net  new jobs. This is the first time in two decades that this has been the case.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

Alright, let’s move on. News Limited papers this morning say asylum seekers are receiving things like TVs,  microwave ovens, furniture amongst welcome packs worth up to $10,000 as they wait to be processed. Now  they are having also their rent paid as well as medical care and other things. Is that responsible or is that  excessive?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, I can understand why millions of Australians would look at that headline and think something is just  not right in our system and look, in the end, the only way to avoid these kinds of anomalies are if we stop  the boats and I have been like a broken record on this for two years now: reopen Nauru, reintroduce  temporary protection visas and keep the option of turning boats around where it’s safe to do so. If we can't  stop the boats, we are still going to have this kind of problem.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

So for all of those, do you think it is a problem that people are receiving some of those items when they  come on to our shores, they receive those packs of $10,000. Is that something you would remove?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think the message is going out loud and clear to the people smugglers and their clients and potential  customers, the red carpet is being rolled out. There is a welcome mat waiting for you here in Australia and  that's the last message that the Federal Government should be sending.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

Ok, so what you would do then is stop the boats, but you would also remove these things that these people  are receiving when they get to Australia?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, people should be in detention while they are being processed. Now, as far as is humanly possible we  don't want to keep kids in detention, but this is taking community release to a whole new level of what looks  like luxury.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

Let's move on. Yesterday's Question Time was not without its dose of drama, after the National Party leader  Warren Truss was ejected from parliament, eleven National Party MPs stormed out in protest. Now, Peter  Slipper is not winning himself any friends in the Opposition, is he, at the moment?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, Peter Slipper’s big problem this week was that the private health insurance means test - which isn't a  reform, it's a rip-off; the private health insurance means test which he, Peter Slipper, had campaigned  ferociously against - became law because of what he did in accepting a squalid deal from Julia Gillard late  last year. Now, I know he apologised to his electorate and he said: don't worry, people of the Sunshine  Coast, the Chinese ambassador will be visiting. Well, because of what this government has done and what  this Speaker has aided and abetted, 2.5 million Australians will face up to $1,000 a year more or $20 a week  more in their private health insurance premiums, and over time all premiums will go up by 10 per cent.  Now, the people who are going to be hit by $1,000 a year more are not rich people. A schoolteacher married  to a policeman is rich, according to this government. Two nurses are rich, according to this government.  Now, these are families that want to get ahead and they are being hit by this government on top of the  carbon tax with $20 a week more in their private health insurance premiums.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

I put it to you right now this morning that you are being soft on Peter Slipper. See, you’ve got to man up  sometimes, Tony Abbott. This is what Laurie Oakes, our man, had to say about Peter Slipper on the show  earlier this week.

LAURIE OAKES:

Peter Slipper doesn't know what a procession is, does he? What he's done, though, he's managed to be as  pompous, but without being nearly as impressive.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

Man up, Tony Abbott.

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, you know, Peter Slipper, he has created an extraordinary spectacle, no doubt about that.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

Soft. You've gone soft.

TONY ABBOTT:

Oh mate. I know I'm a disappointment to you, Karl. Ever since I didn't sail to Hobart with you, mate, I’ve  been a disappointment.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

Exactly. That turned out alright that. See, you missed that one as well.

TONY ABBOTT:

It turned out great, but of course as a politician I think I need to win votes in the western suburbs, not the  eastern suburbs, mate.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

Oh, what are you saying about sailors, they come from all walks of life my friend. You’ve just cost yourself  some votes in the sailing community! Tony, good to talk to you, mate. See you next week.

TONY ABBOTT:

Good on you.
