Wing Commander Colin Leonard Ackland: Completed an operational tour of Vietnam as a Forward Air Controller with the United States 7th Air Force in October, 1971. During  his tour he flevr 488 hours on 224 sorties in 0V-10 light aircraft. On 29th August,  1971, he acted as Forward Air Controller for an air strike in support of South  Vietnamese troops in contact with a battalion size enemy force near Chu Tai. Because  of the very close proximity of the troops to the enemy position, he was informed of the  need for extreme accuracy in attack. He immediately called in an air strike, and then  proceeded to mark the target in the face of heavy automatic weapons fire. Despite a

sudden deterioration in the weather and the vulnerability to enemy ground fire of his  own slow aircraft, he skilfully aided the strike aircraft by making many low passes  over the enemy position to re-mark the target, and by also verbally directing each  strike. The attacks were successful, and the troops were able to secure the area.

Squadron Leader Kenneth David Clark: Served as a helicopter pilot with Ho. 9 Squadron, RAAF, in South Vietnam from July, 1970, till July, 1971. Throughout his tour, six  months of it as the Senior Flight Commander, he was frequently engaged in re-supply  missions, insertion and extraction of troop detachments and reconnaissance patrols.

The missions were often conducted under enemy fire. Typical of these occurred on  8th October, 1970, when his flight, together with a flight of American helicopters,  were ordered to an area in the Xuan Lee District where American troops had sustained  heavy casualties from a large enemy force located in well-bunkered positions. The  aim of the operations was the extraction of scattered ground troops from insecure

positions, so that the force could be concentrated for a subsequent assault against  the enemy force. This was achieved mainly through the leadership, skill and courage  of Squadron Leader Clark as flight leader of the helicopter force.

Squadron Leader Stanley Clark: Was Commanding Officer of Ho. 35 (Caribou) Transport Squadron in South Vietnam from November, 1970 till November, 1971. From the start of  his operational tour, he applied himself to his responsibilities with outstanding  enthusiasm and energy to ensure that his Squadron could meet its commitments with  maximum efficiency. He sought and obtained high standards of proficiency from all  members of his squadron. He concentrated on improving working conditions and facilities  for his subordinates. In the air, his leadership and dedication were equally evident.  The excellent record of task fulfilment achieved by No. 35 Squadron during his term as  Commanding Officer was a tribute to his efforts. The skill and determination he  displayed on many tasks which required him to operate his aircraft into marginal airÂ­ fields under threat of enemy attack, and frequently in adverse weather conditions,  gained the admiration of all with whom he was associated, and the praise of his  operational commander.

Flight Lieutenant Norman Melville Goodall: Flew 1,130 sorties with No. 9 (Helicopter) Squadron in South Vietnam during an operational tour which ended in November, 1971. In the air, he displayed sound tactical judgement and a high level of personal ability.  On 16th February, 1971, elements of the Australian Task Force were in contact with a  large enemy force in heavy jungle. Flight Lieutenant Goodall's gunship team was called  upon to provide close supporting fire to enable the ground forces to re-group. In

this incident, as in many others, he led his team in attacks in the face of enemy  ground fire. As a result, the Task Force was able to re-group and subsequently advance  against the enemy positions. Later the same day, when aircraft extracting a patrol of  No. 2 Special Air Service Squadron came under enemy fire, Flight Lieutenant Goodall*  s

flight was called to their assistance. It was primarily due to his leadership and  determination that the enemy fire was suppressed, and the patrol extracted without  further incident.
