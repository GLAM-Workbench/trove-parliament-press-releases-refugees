Greens condemn PM's asylum deal with Jakarta



Senator Brown, 24th February 2007

The reported deal between the Australian and Indonesian government to return 85  asylum seekers to Indonesia without processing their claims for asylum shows the  Howard government is completely irresponsible, Greens Leader Bob Brown said  today.

"To send asylum seekers back without assessing their refugee status is a bald-faced  breach of Australia's international responsibilities to the Geneva Convention," Senator  Brown said.

"The deal John Howard has engineered with the Indonesians breaches Australia's  responsibilities under the Geneva Conventions and tramples on the human rights of  the 85 Sri Lankan asylum seekers.
