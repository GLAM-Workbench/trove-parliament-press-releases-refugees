TRANSCRIPT OF MINISTER BRENDAN O’CONNOR  SKY NEWS AM AGENDA INTERVIEW  5 AUGUST 2013

E & O E - PROOF ONLY  _____________________________________________________________



Subjects: Newspoll; Choice at the Federal Election; Tony Abbott’s refusal  to debate Kevin Rudd.  _____________________________________________________________



KIERAN GILBERT:            Let's take you live to Melbourne, and the Employment  Minister Brendan O'Connor joins me.

Mr O'Connor, thanks so much for your time this  morning. First of all, I want to get your reaction to the  Newspoll. Kevin Rudd's disapproval rating, as David  and I mentioned, up six points. Is that a bit of a worry  to start the election campaign?

BRENDAN O'CONNOR:   Well, the Prime Minister made clear, Kieran, that we  are the underdog going into the election. This is a  challenging election but we have I think not only the  record but the plans for Australia's future, and the  Australian people get to decide over the course of the  next five weeks, and I think it was an interesting start  to this election announcement.

Your organisation offered a debate to both the

Prime Minister and the leader of the Opposition. The  Prime Minister accepted that offer but, of course, Tony  Abbott rejected it after saying that he would debate the  Prime Minister anytime, anywhere, as soon as the  election was called.

Now, Kieran, if he's not willing to debate the Prime  Minister when asked, then he's not really fit to be  Prime Minister.

KIERAN GILBERT:            But can I - specifically on that poll, Labor's primary  vote is flat. The disapproval for Kevin Rudd's the big,  significant move.

Since he returned five weeks ago, since he returned to  the Prime Ministership, his disapproval rating has  soared 11 points. That's got to be a bit of a concern as  you start this campaign.

BRENDAN O'CONNOR:   Well, let's just look what the Prime Minister's done in a  very short space of time. He's forged a deal with PNG  to deal with asylum seekers.

He's made some very huge ground on bringing  together education reform, realising the Better Schools  program.

We've also had to make some very difficult

decisions, Kieran, in relation to the announcement by  the Treasurer and Finance Minister and the outlining,  by way of an economic statement.

So we've made some difficult decisions and, of  course, you have to make those decisions but if you  look at the decisions that we made, they're fiscally  responsible.

We make sure that we protect the cost of living  pressures on families, but we have been up front with  the Australian people.

It is now incumbent upon the Leader of the  Opposition, Tony Abbott, to come clean with the  Australian people about where he's going to find the  savings, where he's going to cut to find the $70 billion  hole that he has in his [indistinct] -

KIERAN GILBERT:            They've said that they'll do that.

BRENDAN O'CONNOR:   - Well

KIERAN GILBERT:            They've said they'll do that in the election campaign,  but how can the Labor Party promise a new way?  You've been in office two terms, six years. How do  you say your slogan here is a new way?

BRENDAN O'CONNOR:   I think we've seen in recent times very negative  personal politics. I think we've got, in the Opposition  Leader, a very relentlessly negative Opposition  Leader, and I think people are sick of that fractious  debate, and so I think we can do better.

The Prime Minister's made clear he wants to engage  with business, he wants to engage with the community  and in ensuring that we deliver for the Australian  people.

I think there's been evidence of that in the last

several weeks where we've managed to strike  agreements, not only within Australia with state  governments - state Coalition governments, I might  add, on education and disability care, but also forging  agreements with other countries to deal with the very  diabolical, difficult area of public policy, asylum  seekers, and preventing people endangering their  lives getting on an un-seaworthy vessel.

So I think there's been evidence of us working

together, working with constituent parts of our society  so that we can improve the lives of Australians.

Now, what we've seen, by contrast, in that period  though is just the relentless negativity by the  Opposition Leader who has no plans.

He's come together to agree on our education plan  after talking it down, trashing it for months and months  and months, and apparently this week he's now -

KIERAN GILBERT:            Okay, well, Kevin Rudd's

BRENDAN O'CONNOR:   - a believer of our education reform.

KIERAN GILBERT:            Kevin Rudd's opening speech was that he's the best  one to manage the transition out of the China boom,  but how do you make that case when there's been so  much turbulence, dysfunction, within the Labor  Government. Six Small Business Ministers in six years  - you're one of them.

BRENDAN O'CONNOR:   There may well have been some changes, and we've  certainly had some challenges dealing with a minority  government, but I think the runs are on the board  insofar as the big decisions. Nobody's going to  pretend that we are perfect.

There is no such thing as a perfect government, and  we've made some mistakes, but on those big  decisions, Kieran, in responding to the global financial

crisis, the speed and scale of which meant that we  saved hundreds of thousands of jobs.

We were making those decisions when the Opposition  Leader was voting against those actual stimulus  packages that actually protected our economy and  indeed jobs in this country.

Now, I think people will look at us and say, well,

they've made some mistakes but the big decisions  they've got right, and that's why we've got - we're one  of only eight countries in the world, Kieran, who have  a AAA rating from all three agencies and that's why  we've got such a good economic record.

But there's more to be done, and the Prime Minister  wants to make sure that he provides the opportunity  for that to happen -

KIERAN GILBERT:            Okay.

BRENDAN O'CONNOR:   - if we're, of course accepted by the Australian people.

KIERAN GILBERT:            Brendan O'Connor, thanks for your time this morning.  We'll chat to you again many times over this  campaign. Appreciate it.

BRENDAN O'CONNOR:   Thanks Kieran.
