COALITION WELCOMES EMERGENCY RELIEF FOR RWANDA

The Coalition Parties welcome the Australian Government's announcement today that  it will be increasing its total humanitarian relief for the victims of the crisis in Rwanda  to $10 million,

The $3.5 million previously allocated was obviously inappropriate to the scale of the  Suffering and the refugee crisis.

The additional $0.5 million in aid announced today is an initiative which we welcome and  which we hope will alleviate some of the appalling suffering which so many are now  enduring in Rwanda and Zaire.

Wc also welcome the deployment of ADF personnel and the decision to allocate two  RAAF 0 1 3 0  aircraft to Rwanda with water purification and other aid equipment. We  wish our ADF personnel, and all other Australians working in Rwanda, success in their  humanitarian work and a safe return home.

We look forward to the Australian Government keeping the situation in Rwanda, and  the scale and type of Australian assistance, under regular review.
