INTERVIEW WITH KIERAN GILBERT

SKY NEWS AM AGENDA

9 JUNE 2011

SUBJECTS: Malaysia, live cattle exports

KIERAN GILBERT

Welcome back to AM Agenda. With me this morning, from Sydney, the  Labor frontbencher David Bradbury. And from Melbourne, Liberal  frontbencher Bruce Billson. Gentlemen, good morning. David I want to  ask you first of all about the assurances on human rights in Malaysia.  Some of your colleagues like Melissa Parke and Anna Burke, they've  spoken publicly about their concerns about their deal with Malaysia. Will  this guarantee, the immunity from harsh punishment like caning and so  on, will that be enough to placate them?

DAVID BRADBURY

I think so and I think that Chris Bowen has been doing an outstanding job  in working through what has been a very difficult issue and I think that  the proposal that has now been the subject of the agreement, the final  details of which we expect to be announced relatively shortly, really does  achieve a really important and sophisticated response to a very complex  problem. I think though, as Chris Bowen made the point, what is  significant about this arrangement is the fact that it does strike at the  very heart of this notion of the product that the people smugglers have  been selling. I think that that is what is important about this proposal. I  heard the comments that Scott Morrison made and frankly I think that  Scott Morrison is a purveyor of half truths and misinformation and  sometimes even inflammatory innuendo on this issue. But one of the  questions that should have been put to Scott Morrison is that if a durable  solution is as simple as picking up the phone to Nauru and putting TPVs  back in place, why was it that last year he was out there proposing a so  called 'Iranian Solution'? A proposal that said we should take people that  arrive by boat, send them back to Iran and have them processed there. If  he thought that picking up the boat phone to Nauru and putting TPVs in

place, and I just remind you Kieran that when TPVs were put in place  8,000 asylum seekers arrived in the two years after that and in fact 95%  of people who were subject to a TPV ended up being settled in Australia.

GILBERT

But the deal with, just to make it clear with the Iran proposal that Scott  Morrison made, as part of a regional idea in Central Asia at the source  countries to be overseen by the UNHCR, it would not have been an  Australian driven initiative, it would have been a UN initiative. It was an  idea that he floated but it was certainly not a primary option. The primary  option that he's been arguing is Nauru and it remains that the facility  there could be opened tomorrow.

BRADBURY

Absolutely Kieran, but the point remains that what we've just heard from  Scott Morrison is that it's as simple as picking up the phone to Nauru and  slapping TPVs on to people. What we know is that it will require a more  sophisticated response than that. In fact by his own admission, by floating  the proposal and you might seek to say that's about going back to the  source, Malaysia is very much a source or certainly a transit country  through which people seeking asylum in Australia have come. So I think  that there is a bit of hair-splitting going on in relation to those two  proposals but the fundamental point is that when we have Tony Abbott  and Scott Morrison visit Nauru, and every time we hear Tony Abbott  talking about picking up the phone to Nauru, Scott Morrison and Tony  Abbott know, as does Bruce, that that facade will not be enough to tackle  this problem.

GILBERT

Okay let's go to Bruce now then Dave, Bruce respond to a few of David's  points there if you want to but also on Nauru, the argument that Chris  Bowen made in that interview there says that most people sent to Nauru  anyway, this was a one off off-shore processing centre, most of them who  were processed there ended up in Australia so it's not really a disincentive  that they want to break the business model of the people smugglers.

BRUCE BILLSON

Well Labor is so all over the place that they can't even cite evidence which  supports their argument. What Minister Bowen is saying is that under the  Nauru/Temporary Protection Visa model which the Howard Government  implemented, those people that were found to be genuine refugees were  settled in Australia. That's the whole point of the refugee process. What  he doesn't talk about though is that during that period the average  number of boats coming to Australia was three. Now since this great 'we'll

take the product away from the people smugglers' announcement that  Labor has made, there have been six boats arrive with three hundred  people on board. So if they're taking the business model away from the  people smugglers, under the Temporary Protection Visa/Nauru model  which was successful with the Howard Government which included the  orderly settlement of people that were found to be refugees, the point  David was trying to make was about the weakness of the system when it  was actually the strength of the system, three boats a year verses six in  one month since the announcement of this plan. As each day goes by you  see the Government falling over themselves to try and find answers to  the problems that they've obviously not clearly thought about. Now, there  are discussions of two categories of asylum seekers in Malaysia, when we  were assured when that initiative was announced, everyone would be  treated the same. There is now going to be a separate centre where  people are going to be tagged, and then released in to the community.  Where's the follow up care? Care about food, about access to health  services, about education and all the things that Julian Burnside and  others said you could be confident about in Nauru with Australia very  much protecting the welfare of the people that were there that you can't  be confident about in Malaysia. So all I hear are arguments from Labor  which are just shooting themselves in the foot and not answering the real  question which is why won't the Prime Minister pick up the phone to the  President of Nauru and get on with it, with a solution that is proven to  work and proven to see genuine refugees settled in Australia where their  claims are verified.

GILBERT

Bruce I want to look at another big issue today and that is the live cattle  trade. What is the Coalition's position on this? Do you support the  suspension of live exports to Indonesia or not? The Nationals certainly  have been scathing but I've spoken to some Liberals who back it.

BILLSON

Well the issue about what action should be taken has to be looked at in  terms of where the problems are in Indonesia. It's remarkable that a  month before extraordinary and incredibly abhorrent images appeared on  the Four Corners program confronted the Australian public, we learnt that  Minister Ludwig was already aware of the problems. Now what he has  done was initially something we supported, stop the delivery of Australian  cattle to abattoirs found not to be carrying out their activities in a humane  way...

GILBERT

What about short terms bans across the board? Do you support that?

BILLSON

I'm not talking about the temporary short term ban while the Government  gets its act together, we're talking about a ban or prohibition which would  last a very short period of time whilst the Government gets its systems in  place to verify those meat processing operations that are meeting all the  expectations that the Australian public and industry has of them. As  opposed to saying, well everybody is out including those who are doing  the right thing, what kind of a message does that send to people who  have made the investment, have certainty and quality assurance systems  in place so that the animals are treated humanely are now getting swept  up with the rogue abattoirs where decisive action was needed to be taken  and we wonder when Joe Ludwig woke up to what everyone else seemed  to know was going on. Which includes images that were carried in that  broadcast that I understand the Minister was aware of a month before it  went to air. Yet, he was caught flat-footed and now there seems to be no  durable policy that the Government seems to be able to put forward.

GILBERT

David will the Government pay compensation to the graziers affected?

BRADBURY

I'm not going to speculate on the question of compensation but what  we've just heard from Bruce there is something of a revelation. I think he  should pick up the phone and call Warren Truss and advise Warren Truss  that that is indeed Coalition policy if what Bruce has said is in fact the  case. What we've heard from Mr Truss and others within the Coalition is  that there is not a problem here. They have actually asserted that frankly  there is not a problem here.

BILLSON

That's not right David.

BRADBURY

They believe it's not a problem that requires any action. What we have  said is that this is a very difficult issue and I think that the full range of  considerations that have to be taken into account are out there and are  part of the public debate at the moment. The images that we saw on the  Four Corners program were disturbing and every Australian that has seen  them would find them disturbing. Having said that, we have some  challenges we have to work through in terms of the fact that there are  many Australians whose livelihoods are connected to this industry. We  need to make sure that our response is a measured one that sends a very

strong message about the sorts of standards we expect to be maintained  throughout those destination countries, but equally...

GILBERT

Should the Government pay the compensation or should Meat & Livestock  Australia pay it? The industry body.

BRADBURY

I'm not going to speculate on those matters because they will be the  subject of other discussions by people that are closer to the action than  me. I simply make this point and that is that the overwhelming view of  constituents, not just in my electorate but I'm sure in many electorates  across the country has been that Australians believe that we cannot allow  the sorts of activities we've seen aired on that Four Corners program, to  the extent that cleaning up the way in which these standards are adhered  to and maintained in other countries, to the extent that that is needed in  order to maintain an ongoing livestock trade, requires urgent attention  and I think the Minister's response demonstrates that.

GILBERT

Okay let's get Bruce's thoughts, Bruce are you worried that your position  on this is going to alienate some of your constituents who are, obviously  there was a very strong reaction to those images?

BILLSON

Yeah and David is wrong. Warren Truss and the rest of the Coalition have  been very clear. You've got to deal with the rogue operators that have  been handling our Australian cattle humanely. If you saw that Four  Corners report and you saw the cattlemen from the Northern Territory  visibly moved by the images he'd seen, there is nobody who wants to see  cattle treated inhumanely, nobody. Warren Truss has been consistent  about that; the Coalition has been consistent about that. Where the  Government is falling down is that they're damaging those who are doing  the right thing because they've failed to put in place the appropriate  systems to ensure the quality can be maintained, that humane treatment,  proper training, the use of stunning technology and the modern  equipment that meets all of the modern expectations that's reliably  implemented and those abattoirs doing the right thing should be able to  participate in the live cattle export trade. Those who aren't, they shouldn't  be part of it and I think you get universal agreement.

BRADBURY

So do you support what we're doing or not Bruce? I'm no clearer now as  to whether you're going to support us or not.

GILBERT

Unfortunately I can't allow elaboration and you guys will have to chat  after the show, we've run out of time. Thanks a lot fellas, we appreciate it  Bruce and David.
