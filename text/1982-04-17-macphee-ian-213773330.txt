"This successful exercise, culminating in the deportation  of all 146 people from the boat, will serve as a warning  to anyone thinking of trying to enter. Australia illegally",  the Minister for Immigration and.Ethnic Affairs, Mr Ian  Macphee, said today. "Let them take note that the same

action will be taken against anyone trying a similar  venture. "
