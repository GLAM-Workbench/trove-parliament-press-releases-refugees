SENATOR THE HON PENNY WONG  LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION IN THE SENATE  SHADOW MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS  LABOR SENATOR FOR SOUTH AUSTRALIA





E&OE TRANSCRIPT  RADIO INTERVIEW  ABC WORLD TODAY  FRIDAY, 3 FEBRUARY 2017

Subjects: Donald Trump phone call with Malcolm Turnbull; Visit to the US with  Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security; US refugee  resettlement deal; US Alliance.

NAOMI WOODLEY: Shadow Foreign Minister Penny Wong says Donald Trump’s  tweets and the leaked details of the phone call don’t necessarily accord with Malcolm  Turnbull’s view.

SENATOR PENNY WONG, LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION IN THE SENATE: I  think it is very difficult to now accept what Mr Turnbull or his media staff tell people  was actually occurring during the phone call given he was quite definitive earlier in  the week about what was agreed. And that version of events appears, from the  reports, to have not been correct.

WOODLEY: Well Malcolm Turnbull says he is acting in Australia’s interests and he  says he still maintains the President told him this deal would be honoured. Do you  have doubts about that?

WONG: I think the reports today and yesterday, here in Washington, including what  appears to have been backgrounded to a journalist, don’t appear to accord with Mr  Turnbull’s version of what’s occurred. I do think he needs to explain to Australians  how it is what he says is true, if the President has tweeted what he has tweeted.

WOODLEY: Senator Wong has been in the United States this week as part of a  bipartisan delegation meeting security and intelligence officials.

WONG: Well, certainly Australia has been in the press here, much more than we  usually are. The story about the telephone call and the President’s tweet has  obviously been the centre of attention, so, it has been unusual. But we have been  meeting with Americans from a range of institutions and organisations, including the

FBI and the CIA and the Pentagon. And what I would say is despite this controversy  there are a lot of layers to this relationship.

WOODLEY:  Australia’s ambassador to the United States has always been a busy  job but it appears Joe Hockey’s life is about to get even busier. He visited the White  House today for a meeting with the President’s Chief Of Staff Reince Priebus and  Chief Strategist Steve Bannon. Labor’s Penny Wong says the meeting is a good  sign.

WONG: It is a good thing that we continue to engage at all levels of the relationship.  The Alliance as I said is bigger than any individual. Having said that, if we disagree  with a position that the United States Administration takes, be it this or any  Administration, we should be standing up for Australian values and Australian  interests.
