TRANSCRIPT - Radio National Breakfast with Fran Kelly

Topics: Paris attacks, National Security

FRAN KELLY:             The Attorney-General, George Brandis, is member of the National Security  Committee of Cabinet, he joins us from Brisbane.  George Brandis, welcome to Breakfast.

ATTORNEY-GENERAL:     Good morning Fran.

FRAN KELLY:          Minister, if ISIS can strike at the heart of Europe, it can strike anywhere can’t  it, including here?  Is that the message from the weekend attacks in Paris?

ATTORNEY-GENERAL:     I think the message from the weekend attacks is that it reinforces what  the Government has been saying for a very long time now, and that is the threat of terrorism is a very  grave threat, particularly to the Western democratic world, but in fact to all of humanity. I should also  say to you Fran that the Australian people should feel reassured that our national security and policing  agencies are well resourced, they are highly competent, the Government has legislated over the last  two years to give them all the appropriate powers they need, and people should feel a high level of  reassurance that everything that can be done to keep Australians safe is being done.

FRAN KELLY:                          Does that mean, I know the official terror threat levels remains at  High in this country, but as more information emerges about the assailants behind the Paris attacks,  about the intentions of ISIS, does that mean there will be no need for other security measures, or are  measures being considered by the National Security Committee of Cabinet?

ATTORNEY-GENERAL:     Well Fran, there is no evidence of a connection between the events in  Paris and anything bearing upon the security situation in Australia. But of course the Government, and  particularly the national security agencies in Australia, keep the situation in Australia under constant  review.

FRAN KELLY:                          ASIO has already told us that it is monitoring about 400 individuals  regarding as high priority when it comes to terrorism investigations. These attacks on Paris, in your  view, in the view of the agencies, are they likely to be a sort of recruiting tool for ISIS?

ATTORNEY-GENERAL:     Well whenever an event of this kind occurs, then obviously it gives  encouragement to other like-minded people and these are obviously very grave events, and the  national security agencies and he the police are very alert to ensure that there isn’t any copycat  behaviour in Australia. As I said in answer to your previous question, there is no evidence that there is

a direct connection between the events in Paris and the security situation in Australia. But that being  said, we are of course very conscious to be as alert as we possibly can be to any possible threats in  Australia.

FRAN KELLY:                          Well Tony Abbott, former Prime Minister, said on the weekend that  Paris shows that ISIS is getting stronger. I mean, is it beyond doubt that ISIS is extending its reach?  We’ve seen the attacks in Paris, of course the attacks on the Russian jet liner, the attacks in Beirut,  that it’s operating beyond its borders and as it said in that statement on the weekend, this is just the  first of the storm and to teach France and all nations following its path that they will remain at the top  of ISIS’s list of targets. Do you think that includes Australia?

ATTORNEY-GENERAL:     What the horrifying events in Paris tell us is that the warnings that the  Australia Government and other Western leaders, European and American leaders have been  expressing for a long time now, that the threat from ISIS is not to be underestimated, were prudent  warnings. And what we must do in Australia, and what we are doing, is to ensure that all measures  that are necessary to keep our people safe, whether it be giving the agencies the resources and powers  they need, whether it be the legislative framework, whether it be operational matters are being done as  well as possible, and I can assure you, Fran, and your listeners, that we have the best security and  policing agencies in the world to ensure that the Australian people are safe.

FRAN KELLY:                          The challenge is so high though isn’t it?  One of the attackers in Paris  is described as a petty criminal known to the police but not regarded as a high level terrorist threat.  It’s almost impossible isn’t it for the security agencies to prevent an attack from a person like this,  because you can’t monitor everybody if you don’t think they are a threat?

ATTORNEY-GENERAL:     Well what that demonstrates Fran is the gravity of the situation, and  we have highly skilled, national security agencies, we have extremely skilfully and well trained police  forces. The figure you quoted before, there are 400 investigations, approximately 400 investigations  being undertaken by ASIO at the moment is correct and I see the intelligence on a daily basis Fran,  and I can assure you, and I can assure your listeners, that although this is not a failsafe process,  everything that can be done by the agencies is being done.

FRAN KELLY:                          You’re listening to RN Breakfast. Our guest is Federal Attorney-General George Brandis who is in charge of course of designing Australia’s anti-terror laws, but also  is a member of the National Security Committee of Cabinet. The agencies have told us, as has the  Prime Minister and others including yourself, that one important weapon in the fight against terrorism  is intelligence, is the strong links within Muslim community because we need that kind of  intelligence, for instance, you know we know in these attacks in Paris. This wasn’t organised online,  through that kind of online chatter that can somehow be picked up, therefore we need human  intelligence you would think. Now again to quote Tony Abbott, he told Andrew Bolt on the weekend  that as a matter of general principle, we should - quote - be only bringing into Australia refugees from  the Middle-East who are prepared to join our team. It kind of reinforces his call as Prime Minister that  Muslim leaders should speak out more for peace - let’s listen.

TONY ABBOTT: It’s absolutely incumbent on all descent people, but particularly on religious  leaders, Muslim religious leaders to say this is not part of our faith, it never should have been and it  must not be now.

FRAN KELLY:                          Just wondering what you thought of that call, given the emphasis  that’s been put on trying to build cooperation with the Muslim community rather than give any sort of  alienation, sense of alienation to them.

ATTORNEY-GENERAL:     Well let me make two points Fran. First of all working closely and  collaboratively with the Muslim community is absolutely essential, it’s absolutely essential and ASIO,  the Australian Federal Police, state and territory police forces have gone to a great deal of trouble to  foster close relationships with the Islamic community, with the Muslim community because that is  essential. As Mr Turnbull said recently - are our necessary partners in confronting this menace.

But secondly in relation to Mr Abbott comments, I don’t interpret Mr Abbott’s comments to be  anything other than a powerful and strong endorsement of the policies that Mr Turnbull has continued  to implement. As I said in a speech I gave to the Centre for Independent Studies last Friday week,  with the change of Prime Ministers and the change of the composition of the National Security  Committee of Cabinet, our national security policies and priorities have not changed one iota.

FRAN KELLY:                          But the language around engagement with the community has, and  that was signalled quite publically by the Government in the wake of this event, how important is that,  and therefore I wonder to how you respond the comments from say the Deputy Speaker in the New  South Wales Parliament calling on the Prime Minister to close Australia’s boarders to Middle-Eastern  refugees. Are you concerned about those calls?

ATTORNEY-GENERAL:     Well I haven’t seen those remarks and I’m not going to comment on  remarks I haven’t seen. But let me remind you Fran, and your listeners, that Australia is the most  successful multicultural society in the world, and the Muslim community are a very important element  of Australian society. The fact that a very small minority of fanatics defy the teachings of the Islamic  religion by engaging in terrorist crime whether overseas, or as we’ve seen on three instances now in  the last year in Australia, should not reflect upon the Muslim community. The worst thing we could  do is to alienate the Muslim community. They are our fellow citizens, and they are our necessary  partners in combating this menace.

FRAN KELLY:                          And Attorney-General, could I ask you about the flow on impacts on  this in the fight against ISIS, because you are a member of the National Security Committee of  Cabinet and we’ve seen it reported over the weekend, just overnight actually, the White House says,  Obama saying the US will work with France as coalition attacks ramp up and will seek additional  contributions from other partners, including Australia. Do you anticipate, or has Australia been asked  for a greater military contributing to ISIS, and do you think if we are asked we should respond  positively?

ATTORNEY-GENERAL:     Well that’s a decision that hasn’t yet been made. Might I point out that  after the United States, which is far and away the largest contributor to the military coalition in the  Middle-East, Australia is actually the second largest contributor. So our contribution is substantial  one, particularly the contribution of the RAAF is a very substantial one, and I think it is a necessary  one because ISIS has to be defeated militarily as well as whatever other policies and measures that we  adopt, it is necessary to defeat ISIS militarily in Syria and Northern Iraq.

FRAN KELLY:                          Minister, we are about to be joined by Michelle Grattan. She’s  written a story today saying that Australia was not invited to the talks in Vienna, the talks trying to get  a political solution in Syria, reportedly because Russia vetoed us. Is that your understanding, can you  confirm that?

ATTORNEY-GENERAL:     Well I’m not familiar with that.  My understanding is that these talks  were primarily talks between Secretary Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov. In relation to  who else was at the table I have nothing to say.

FRAN KELLY:                          Just more broadly at our terror laws, in terms of foreign fighters  which is important because the agencies have great concerns about Australians who might have gone  over to fight with ISIS and come back. Under Australian law dual-national citizens can legally fight  for the armies of their second country, so they could join the Lebanese, Russian, Turkish, Egyptian  armies. Is it time for that to be reconsidered?

ATTORNEY-GENERAL:     Well we are talking about irregular troops, we’re not talking about  people who legitimately serve in the armies of foreign countries, in the military of foreign countries.  And these laws were designed specifically to deal with a civil war situation such as we are seeing in  the Middle- East. More broadly on the architecture of our anti-terrorism laws Fran, I think that, if I  may say so, your observation on Insiders yesterday that it was necessary to tighten our laws and that  we have it about right now, was a prudent and accurate observation. But that being said, we of course,  and this is my job, we of course constantly keep our laws constantly under review to ensure that they  are as fit for purpose, that they are as effective as they possibly can be too keep our community safe.

FRAN KELLY:                             Attorney-General that you very much for joining us.

ATTORNEY-GENERAL:     Thank you very much Fran.
