CAMBODIA - COMPREHENSIVE PEACE OR KHMER ROUGE VICTORY?

AN ADDRESS BY SENATOR ROBERT HILL, SHADOW MINISTER FOR FOREIGN

AFFAIRS, TO THE MELBOURNE BRANCH OF THE LIBERAL PARTY.

31 OCTOBER 1990

COM M O N W faTtTT

INTRODUCTION

In December 1978, the invasion of Cambodia by Vietnam brought

about the overthrow of the Khmer Rouge regime. During the three

years of its reign, the Khmer Rouge killed about a quarter of

Cambodia's population. Eleven years later, the conflict

continues as the three resistance factions, including and

arguably dominated by the Khmer Rouge, and the Phnom Penh based

Hun Sen government continue to struggle over the division of

power in Cambodia.

Australia has been a leading proponent of a UN sponsored

comprehensive peace settlement for Cambodia in which all four

Cambodian factions would participate. It has been the view of

the Australian Government that it is better to commit the Khmer

Rouge to a peaceful arrangement than have it remain a volatile

and unpredictable force. The Australian Opposition has been of

the same view.

It was of course never intended that this be a path by which the

murderous Khmer Rouge could return to power, or a shield behind

which they could in the meantime extend their power and

authority.

However, events in Cambodia over the last twelve months - the

escalation of the conflict and gains made by the Khmer Rouge,

together with a range of difficulties being faced by the Phnom

2

These concerns, which the Opposition has been raising for some

time and which have been peremptorily dismissed by Senator Evans

and the Australian Government, have now reached the level whereby

they demand serious analysis.

Nothing would be worse for Cambodia than the Australian

Government inadvertently facilitating the return to power of the

Khmer Rouge.

Penh regime - give cause for concern.

KHMER ROUGE ACTIVITIES

Aims

The complex question of course remains that of the role and aims

of the Khmer Rouge in the peace process.  By some interpretations

their political power has actually diminished in the last few

months as a result of the declared vacancy of the Cambodian UN

seat.  This removed defacto international legitimacy from the

Khmer Rouge, which militarily dominates the resistance coalition.

However, it can be more strongly argued that such legitimacy has

been restored and even strengthened by allowing the Khmer Rouge

to participate in the Supreme National Council, and that this

indeed bestows on the Khmer Rouge international recognition.

What the Khmer Rouge intends to do with this political power

requires a cautious response.

Given that the Khmer Rouge has a lot to lose in any free

3

elections, it may be that they intend to use the UN plan to delay

elections until their guerrilla forces control enough of the

countryside (either directly or through intimidation) to ensure

the maximum vote.  In this way the Khmer Rouge has interim

legitimacy as part of the Supreme National Council, but can use

its resultant political power to delay a ceasefire, which is a

prerequisite to elections and a UN administration. By maximising

its ground before a ceasefire, the Khmer Rouge's existing gains

are frozen. Complying with a ceasefire means it has an official

role in Phnom Penh for the interim one to two years it takes to

organise elections.

However, the whole idea of a ceasefire is problematic as it would

require disarming all parties, yet the Khmer Rouge is believed

to have secret arms supplies (approximately three years worth),

which would enable it to continue its guerrilla activities.

Recent reports do not indicate any diminution of the Khmer

Rouge's military activities, indeed they suggest the opposite.

In addition, there is the danger of the old Khmer Rouge political

leadership returning to power. Although in December 1979 Pol Pot

was purportedly replaced by Khieu Samphan as leader of the Khmer

Rouge, reports consistently indicate that Pol Pot does in fact

retain leadership of the Khmer Rouge and its armed forces, and

appears to run it from a refugee camp in Thailand.

The Khmer Rouge is controlled by about eight top people of which

Khieu Samphan, reportedly only Pol Pot's "public face", is

4

believed to be number eight or nine in the organisation. Khieu

Samphan and another Pol Pot supporter, Son Sen, are the Khmer

Rouge's representatives on the Supreme National Council. Son Sen

is a leading figure in the hierarchy and is seen as far from

respectable, being a general in the Khmer Rouge army which

originally captured Phnom Penh, and subsequently defence

minister, and was believed to have a role in "internal security"

and the resultant genocide. Son Sen is also reportedly related

to Pol Pot which is important in the formation of power factions

and adds weight to the belief that Pol Pot is still in charge.

There is therefore no guarantee that Pol Pot will not return to

power behind the shield of a peace settlement.

However, it appears that in the short term at least, the Khmer

Rouge believes that its power aspirations are best served by

maximising military gains, both in terms of controlling the

countryside prior to elections and also as a means to destabilise

the Hun Sen Government.

Military Activities

Over the past year, the Khmer Rouge has expanded its influence

in the countryside and during recent months, several trends in

Khmer Rouge activities have been observed. The attacks are

increasing in scale and are no longer confined to remote areas -

reflective of this are the growing number of war related injuries

being treated in the major centres.

5

The Khmer Rouge appear to be steadily advancing into the interior

of Cambodia to areas previously free of fighting, compared to a

year ago when fighting was concentrated in northern and western

Cambodia, close to the Thai border.  The strategy appears to be

encirclement of Phnom Penh, with the guerrillas fanning out from

Kompong Thom to the north, Kampot to the south and Kompong

Chhnang to the northwest of Phnom Penh. Although the Khmer Rouge

do not appear to be holding large tracts of territory in these

areas, they are now exhibiting an ability to discriminantly

choose their targets, attack and then make an orderly withdrawal.

The territory where Khmer Rouge influence is constant encompasses

western Battambang and Siem Reap provinces - controlling no more

than 500 000 people. However, far ranging attacks have been

reported against the towns of Kompong Thom and Kompong Svay, as

well as against Kompong Cham and Kompong Som.

In addition, there is a disturbing trend towards attacking

civilian trains: the latest attack occurred only thirteen

kilometres outside of Cambodia's main port of Kompong Som. The

train was derailed through the use of landmines, followed up by

a guerrilla attack which killed fifty people. This followed two

other attacks on trains on the Kompong Som to Phnom Penh line in

June and mid-July, the latter just west of Phnom Penh. This is

further evidence that the Khmer Rouge are more confidently

engaging in wider ranging attacks against higher profile targets.

The Khmer Rouge, which usually moves in small groups (up to a

6

maximum of 200), has also been reported as moving in larger

groups of up to 400. These groups, usually heavily armed, have

been harassing villages for food, apparently in an intimidatory

effort to dissuade the men from enlisting in the Phnom Penh

goverment's army. Other incidents involving the terrorisation

and/or killing of local government officials have also been

reported. These techniques no doubt are being used to scare the

people out of cooperating with the Phnom Penh government,

although a more persuasive "hearts and minds" campaign has also

been reported, which however does not apply to those who need

"reeducation".

More disturbing are reports that 24 Chinese tanks have been

delivered to the Khmer Rouge, and that possibly more heavy

equipment is en route. Around eighty Khmer Rouge tank crews have

apparently been trained by China in the last two years.  The

arrival of the tanks may signal an upgrade in conflict, and

according to Jane's Defense Weekly, even a shift to conventional

military tactics. The seizure of larger towns and cities would

require such a shift.  This analysis is supported by evidence of

road building on a large scale, from the Thai-Cambodian border

to within thirty kilometres of Angkor Wat and the reported

positioning of twelve tanks there. The other twelve are

apparently situated in the north near Pailin.

Although the tactical value of such heavy weapons is limited

without adequate logistical support (which is problematic so far

from the border power base), the value lies in their

7

psychological impact on the people and the pressure they put on

Phnom Penh. The tanks seem to indicate that the Khmer Rouge does

not intend to stop fighting and may decide to escalate the

conflict. A  significant Khmer Rouge victory will add to the

notion that the Khmer Rouge are invincible and drive further

support from the Phnom Penh Government out of fear of

retribution.

The tanks provide added firepower to the apparent Khmer Rouge

preparation for an end-of-year dry season offensive, which on

most indications, is likely to be centred around the city of Siem

Reap, which has a population of 70 000, and the culturally and

historically significant Angkor Wat temple complex.  Even the

ability to seriously threaten these may achieve the desired

psychological effect on the Cambodian forces.

In order to do this, the Khmer Rouge will continue to rely on

lines of supply and support which are still coming through

Thailand.  Indeed, the delivery of the Chinese tanks was

purportedly made through Thai military bases, and between October

1989 and May 1990 some of the largest ever flows of Chinese arms

to the Khmer Rouge were reported.  China is the Khmer Rouge's

main supplier, but it is unclear to what extent China is able to

influence Khmer Rouge activities.

The Khmer Rouge's main source of day-to-day support is from the

refugee camps it controls within Thailand. This support may be

threatened as Thailand proposed in March to move the refugees to

8

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Â·;Ã¢ÂÂ

"neutral" camps under UN administration, and more recently it has

been reported that the resistance forces are being encouraged by

Thailand to move back into Cambodia.  However, for the present,

the Khmer Rouge logistic centres remain in the refugee camps.

There is of course the possibility that the Khmer Rouge may

decide that their aim of regaining power is better served by

resorting to force once more and abandoning the UN peace plan.

This of course would likely destroy any vestiges of legitimacy.

It is therefore more likely that at least for the time being they

will continue to seek military gain whilst publicly endorsing the

scheme. They can then always escalate fighting so as to achieve

a political settlement on their own terms, calculating that

external powers, especially Vietnam, are now unlikely to

intervene.

THE PHNOM PENH GOVERNMENT

Turning to the Phnom Penh Government, its stability and power

must also be considered in evaluating the Khmer Rouge's

activities, as it is the credibility of the Hun Sen Government

which the Khmer Rouge is attempting to undermine.

The Vietnamese installed Hun Sen Government appears to meet most

criteria regarding effective government and on this basis has

largely achieved international credibility despite its "illegal"

institution.

9

Yet the Khmer Rouge is not the only challenge the Hun Sen

Government has to face.  There is evidence o'f instability within

the government, as not only must it cope with external policy

changes and international events, but an internal power struggle

is also in evidence.

Phnom Penh's main source of support - aid from the Soviet Union

and Eastern bloc nations - has substantially diminished as these

nations wrestle with their own economic ills and seek aid

themselves. This had previously represented 80% of Cambodia's

aid receipts, and accompanying its disappearance are many

expatriate advisers. Vietnam has been similarly affected, with

flow-on consequences for its ability to aid Cambodia.

This in turn has had effect on the already fragile Cambodian

economy, with reports of increasing government redundancies. In

addition, attempts to stabilise the currency have failed and

inflation is creating hardship. A projected shortfall in the

rice crop this year will create further hardship and detract from

Phnom Penh's support amongst the people.

Within the Phnom Penh Government itself, there is evidence of

increasing disunity. This follows the arrest of senior government

officials in May, who were accused of plotting a coup, although

it is alleged that they were trying to form an alternative

political party to take advantage of anticipated UN sponsored

elections. Many of these officials were close to Hun Sen. Other

liberals have also been removed in a low-key purge within the

10

Party.

Hun Sen's security within the regime is uncertain, as although

he has competently represented Cambodia's position

internationally, he has been criticised internally for giving too

much away in the peace negotiations while receiving too little

in return. Criticism has also been made of growing corruption

within the government and the inability to contain guerrilla

advances.

This criticism has come from a hardline conservative faction

within the ruling party, which appears to be cracking down on

liberalisation and moving to a more conservative Marxist

position. The rise of these conservatives has seen the emergence

of Chea Sim, also formerly Khmer Rouge and number two in the

Politburo of the ruling Kampuchean People's Revolutionary Party.

The ascent of such hardliners to power may have adverse

consequences for the possibility of a peace settlement.

In turn the Hun Sen Government has still to cope with guerrilla

attacks. In military terms, Phnom Penh's army has been described

as ill equipped, corrupt and possessing low morale, although it

is considerably larger than that of the Khmer Rouge. In response

to the indications of a Khmer Rouge buildup, the Hun Sen

government is reported to have launched a major offensive on

several fronts to try to retake guerrilla territory. This

appears focused on the Khmer Rouge held town of Pailin in the

north. .

11

In addition, there are reports of the Phnom Penh government

utilising airpower to drop bombs on guerrilla held areas which,

according to the Asia-Pacific Defence Reporter, is technically

inappropriate. They have also stepped up unpopular military

conscription and are relocating the population from villages

frequented by the Khmer Rouge. This not only removes the

villagers from the scene of conflict, but deprives the Khmer

Rouge of a source of food supply.

Therefore it seems likely that the conflict between the Hun Sen

Government and the Khmer Rouge will escalate as the Khmer Rouge

seeks to maximise its position on the ground before perhaps

agreeing to a ceasefire. There is little evidence that Hun Sen

has the capacity to restrain the growing power projection

capabilities of the Khmer Rouge.

CONCLUSIONS

Senator Evans has dismissed the latest Khmer Rouge attack on a

civilian train as just another example of guerrilla tactics,

believing that it was not "any more significant than that either

as demonstrating imminent takeover by the Khmer Rouge militarily,

or destruction of the peace process" (Sunday 21.10.90). While

it may not yet demonstrate either of those two things, the

pattern of Khmer Rouge activity cannot be ignored or dismissed

as Senator Evans does again when he exhorts that the

international community must "not place too much emphasis on

transient alarums and diversions" (Hansard 17.10.90 p3238).

12

The power and influence of the Khmer Rouge has been

underestimated by the Australian government and there are

worrying signs as to its intentions and capabilities. Not only

is the current leadership much the same as in the days of the

Khmer Rouge's murderous power, but there are no mechanisms in

place to prevent the return of such leadership, either as a

consequence of favourable election results or military victory.

Whilst military victory for any one faction has always been

perceived as very remote, the recent increase in Khmer Rouge

capabilities and activities, combined with a poorly equipped and

motivated Phnom Penh army, may result in greater Khmer Rouge

authority in Cambodia. In addition, the general economic malaise

of Cambodia, together with internal power struggles within the

ruling party, may result in less resources with which to combat

guerrilla activities and also facilitate Khmer Rouge objectives.

There is little doubt that the intimidatory tactics are affecting

morale. Over 150 000 Cambodians have been displaced by military

activity, resulting in more than just a humanitarian problem.

Senator Evans has assessed that the Khmer Rouge wants peace and

will participate in a peaceful resolution of the power struggle.

The Australian Government's promotion of a comprehensive

settlement which includes the Khmer Rouge must be premised on

that assessment. The basis of such an assessment is unclear.

In fact the transfer of government functions from Phnom Penh to

13

the United Nations, which is the essence of the "Evans'  Plan",

more than anything weakens Hun Sen in the run up to an election

and correspondingly benefits the Khmer Rouge.

The tactic of concentrating on the form of interim UN government,

rather than pressing for a ceasefire, gives the Khmer Rouge the

time it needs to extend its gains. It was no accident that the

Khmer Rouge boycotted the Tokyo talks which concentrated on the

issue of a ceasefire.

In general terms ASEAN has of course been less concerned by the

Khmer Rouge - being more worried by the extending Vietnamese

influence which was seen to take the form of the Hun Sen

Government.  In the comprehensive settlement plan in its current

form, Australia has supported the ASEAN position with the

additional initiative of promoting the concept of effective power

being passed to the UN rather than the Supreme National Council.

Whether the Khmer Rouge allows the comprehensive peace plan to

be implemented must remain doubtful.  For the time being it

provides a shield, but it is difficult to conceive the Khmer

Rouge, now stronger than at any time since its defeat by the

Vietnamese, and after ten years of guerrilla campaigning,

abandoning its gains to go to the ballot box where they know they

will not succeed.

At present, the movement towards the comprehensive settlement has

stalled and it seems unlikely that Senator Evans' optimistic

14

prediction of a UN presence in Cambodia by the beginning of next

year will be achieved.

The Australian Opposition parties have supported the

comprehensive settlement concept on the basis that if it works

and locks in the Khmer Rouge, it would be a better result than

excluding them and ensuring continuing guerrilla opposition.

However, as the year has progressed, with the changes in the

relative strengths within Cambodia the Opposition has become

increasingly concerned that the originally conceived power

balance was not that which was to be locked in at the point of

settlement. The Australian Government does not seem to share

that concern.

The possibility that the peace settlement Australia is sponsoring

may either directly or inadvertently return Pol Pot and his Khmer

Rouge colleagues to power is horrific. Yet it seems that the

Australian Government may well be misreading the signs.

The question remains that of what can now be done. The P5, urged

on by ASEAN and Australia, is not about to abandon the

comprehensive settlement. The Australian Government has further

refused to take up the Opposition's call for an action in

genocide against Pol Pot and his deputies which would at least

have split the genocidal leaders of the Khmer Rouge from those

who are now claiming international legitimacy.

Time would now appear to be on the side of the Khmer Rouge.

15

V

Greater efforts should therefore be made to settle the

outstanding issues. The US initiative on the Cambodian UN seat

put pressure on the resistance coalition. Pressure must now be

imposed to resolve the question of the composition of the Supreme

National Council. It does not seem unreasonable that Hun Sen be

Vice-Chairman and have Prince Sihanouk as Chairman.

More pressure must be applied for an early ceasefire. The

ceasefire will test whether the factions, and in particular

whether the Khmer Rouge, are genuine in seeking a peaceful

settlement. Furthermore, the UN cannot commence its work until

a ceasefire is achieved.

The escalation of the conflict through the possession of tanks

and heavy equipment must cease. For a time the airforce of Phnom

Penh was kept out of the conflict because it could only lead the

Khmer Rouge to try to obtain anti-aircraft missiles. The trend

is worrying and certainly not conducive to peace.

Australia and those sponsoring the settlement must also spell out

the guarantees under which Pol Pot and his deputies will be

excluded from any post-settlement rule in Cambodia.

Finally, a settlement without the Khmer Rouge must not be ruled

out.  The world community must make it clear that the objective

is a real peace for the Cambodian people and not just the

settlement of a nagging international problem. The position of

the Khmer Rouge in the peace process, granted to them by the

16

Ã¢ÂÂ y

international community, must not be without conditions. That

is the least we owe those ordinary and innocent Cambodians who

remember the genocide and have suffered so much.
