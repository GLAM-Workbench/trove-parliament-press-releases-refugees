TONY ABBOTT:

It’s terrific to be here in Adelaide. South Australia is a great state with a great future. It is being held back by  a bad government in Canberra and a bad government here in Adelaide. That’s why I am so pleased to be  here with Isobel Redmond, my state parliamentary colleague and friend.

As far as I’m concerned, I will do everything I humanly can to boost the economic prospects of this state.  That means doing everything we can to ensure that the Olympic Dam mine expansion goes ahead, that  means getting rid of the carbon tax, getting rid of the mining tax, restoring the Australian Building and  Construction Commission. If we want South Australians to have the better future they deserve we need  Olympic Dam and, frankly, it’s almost disloyal of South Australians to merely be passive in the face of the  carbon tax and the mining tax, because as Jacques Nasser and Marius Kloppers have pointed out, it is very  hard to go ahead with this investment in the face of all these new taxes.

Isobel.

ISOBEL REDMOND:

Look, can I just reiterate what Tony has to say about that because it’s clear that this Government in  particular in South Australia has based the economic future and the budget on this tax, on this development  at Olympic Dam and yet they haven’t come out opposing the carbon tax or the Mining Resource Rent Tax  and indeed we have already in this state apart from those, the highest taxing state in the nation. It is making  it impossible for businesses to succeed here and I’m very grateful that Tony’s here flying the flag for the  federal Liberals because we desperately need a Liberal government at both a state and federal level.

TONY ABBOTT:

Ok, any questions?

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, why do you think the Labor Party is doing quite well in South Australia, relative to the rest of  the nation?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, I don’t believe that the Labor Party is really doing very well anywhere. I think that here in South  Australia, as throughout our country, the carbon tax is just toxic. People understand that it started on the 1st  of July, but it didn’t finish on the 1st of July and the longer the carbon tax lasts, the worse the impact will be.  We gave examples in the Parliament this week of businesses in South Australia, employers in South  Australia, that have faced massive increases in their power bills because of the carbon tax. As I said in the  Parliament this week, every time your power bill goes up Julia Gillard has a smile on her face because that’s  just the carbon tax doing its job.

QUESTION:

You gave a very fulsome outline today of the changes you intend to make if you claim government. Do you  think the state Liberal Party is doing enough of that?

TONY ABBOTT:

The short answer is yes. The first time I heard Isobel speak, it was shortly before the South Australian state  election. She had a very clear and comprehensible message for the voters of South Australia: we weren’t  going to waste so much money on unnecessary relocation of hospitals, we were going to harvest waste  water, we were going to have an ICAC and there were going to need more police. A very simple, deliverable  message and I thought what a breath of fresh air and, frankly, it was acknowledged by the voters because we  got 52 per cent of the two party preferred vote here in the last South Australian election.

QUESTION:

And what’s your understanding of what the state Liberal Party is fighting for now?

TONY ABBOTT:

Fighting for a better government, that’s what the Coalition is doing right around Australia. We are fighting  for a better government. In Canberra and here in South Australia, we are fighting for a better government in  Canberra and a better government in Adelaide.

QUESTION:

Do you have a particular sense of what policies would change under a state Liberal government?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, it’s pretty clear that what will happen under Liberal governments right around Australia is that we will  get taxes down, we will get the level of services up and in the case of the federal government we’ll get more  secure borders.

QUESTION:

That’s pretty broad stuff, though. Is there anything specific that you know of in the South Australian  government that could be changed by a Liberal government?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, the whole point of the Coalition is to ensure that we have governments in power that work with people  and in particular work with business to try to ensure that we have more prosperous communities and we  have stronger economies, because if we have more prosperous communities and stronger economies, we  have the better services that Australia needs.

QUESTION:

So, you can’t name a single state Liberal Party policy?

TONY ABBOTT:

My job is to support my state colleagues which I am extremely happy to do and I’m going to ask Isobel to  talk about the policies of the state party, but look, I’m here to say, Isobel Redmond is doing a fine job, the  state parliamentary party is doing a fine job and if the people of South Australia want change for the better,  they need to get behind the state parliamentary Liberal Party and the federal parliamentary Liberal Party.

QUESTION:

But Mr Abbott, how can they be doing a fine job when state Labor is still in an election-winning position?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think we’ve handled the state questions. Now, we’re going to move on to federal questions.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, the asylum vote got up through the Senate last night, but politically, is there really a winner on  either side here? I mean, the Government’s had to do a big back flip, but you’ve got one aspect up which  you supported and previous to that, you didn’t want to be told what to do by committees, so is it sort of a bit  of a draw there?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I welcome the fact that the Government has finally - after four long and often tragic years - accepted  the need for offshore processing at Nauru. I am pleased and thankful that at long last, the Prime Minister has  seen what was always obvious here: that John Howard’s policies were right. But all she’s done so far is give  us one out of three Howard Government’s policies and if you want to get John Howard’s results, you’ve got  to have John Howard’s resolve. That’s what we haven’t seen so far from this Prime Minister. One out of  three Howard Government policies is a start, but if you want to stop the boats, you need three out of three  and that’s what we haven’t got from this Prime Minister.

QUESTION:

How many people would you expect to be processed on Manus Island and Nauru once they get up and  running?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, the interesting thing this very day is that we’ve seen five boats in a 24 hour period. What we’re seeing  here is obviously a determined effort by the people smugglers to test the resolve and the character of this  Government. Now, I’ve got to say that the resolve and the character of this Government has been found  wanting time and time again on this subject. So, Julia Gillard is being put to the test by the people

smugglers. I hope she rises to that challenge, but you’ve got to say - based on what we’ve seen from this  Government over the last four years - there’s got to be a lot of doubt.

QUESTION:

But how many people would it be reasonable to process in those two facilities?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, that depends upon how many boats we get and if you put the right policies in place, the current flood  of boats would slow to a trickle. I mean, you’ve got to compare the record of the Coalition versus the record  of the Labor Party. John Howard inherited a problem and crafted a solution. Julia Gillard inherited a solution  and created a problem. This Government gave the people smugglers their business model. Belatedly, after  22,000 illegal arrivals, after nearly 400 boats, after a thousand deaths and $4.7 billion in budget blowouts,  finally they’ve seen sense and have adopted just one, just one, out of the three policies needed to stop the  boats. Now, as I said, the people smugglers are now putting this Government to the test. What we need from  the Prime Minister is the same kind of resolve that John Howard consistently showed on this issue, because  if you want John Howard’s results, you’ve got to have John Howard’s resolve.

QUESTION:

[inaudible]

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, I’ve never been so crass as to directly accuse the Government in this area. If there is someone to  blame for the tragedy it is the people smugglers, but we have to understand that the Government gave the  people smugglers their business model. Did the Government want the people smuggling boats to come  again? Of course it didn’t. But it willed the end without willing the means and that’s the tragedy of this  Government: it wanted to get the right outcome without having the insight and the magnanimity to  implement the right policies.

Thank you.
