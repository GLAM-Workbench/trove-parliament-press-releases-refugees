Topics: Labor’s Border Protection Crisis / Failed Malaysian Solution

Luke Bona

We are talking about the headline about the hygiene lessons being needed to help migrants integrate.  It was in fairness and off the cuff remark by a junior Coalition MP Theresa Gambaro, who is the  Opposition Spokesperson on Citizenship and Ms Gambaro has been working on comprehensive plans  for cultural awareness training for temporary workers brought into Australia to meet our shortage of  skilled employees, particularly in the mining sector. Now in her view we are doing these workers a  disservice by not bringing them up to speed on what’s culturally acceptable in our way of life, like not  queue jumping, covering your mouth when you cough and sneeze, its not ok to miss a shower once or  twice a day and she was quoted in The Australian saying without trying to be offensive, practises such  as wearing deodorant are the norm in Australia and yet migrants aren’t being told how important this is  when working closely with other people. She might not have been trying to be offensive but judging by  some of the calls today that’s what has happened and the lines have been going into meltdown with  people suggesting the Brisbane MP might like to include the whole population and not just new  Australians in her campaign for better manners. What still concerns me is that this storm in a spray can  is masking the ongoing still unsolved saga involving the fleet of leaky boats still headed our way, full of  illegal asylum seekers. Three boat loads have arrived since the start of the New Year and we know  more are on the way. Well Kevin ‘07’ has finally left the northern hemisphere and has organised a chat  with his Malaysian counterpart in Jakarta, prompted by new reports that Malaysia is about to make it  even easier for the most desperate boat people to fly into that nation. If you recall last week they  announced relaxed visa rules for thirteen countries and that includes Afghanis, Bangladeshis, Sri  Lankans and Pakistanis, the most common nationalities for arriving on the boats. So what do we do?  Michael Keenan is on the line. Michael Keenan is the acting Immigration spokesperson. Mr Keenan,  good afternoon.

Michael Keenan

Good afternoon Luke, it’s good to talk to you.

Luke Bona

Good to talk to you too. We haven’t yet got an answer and you are going to say that the Coalition  needs to come along and play hardball but you have got to admit that Malaysia relaxing their visa rules  is not making it easier, correct?

Michael Keenan

I think you are talking about Indonesia relaxing their visa rules and look ultimately as Australian  politicians we can be in charge over what happens in Australia and the reason that we have had the  collapse of any orderly process on our borders is because of policy changes that were taken in  Australia by the Labor Party and the answer to our problems doesn’t lie in Jakarta of course, it lies in  Canberra. What we need to do is we need to remove the incentives that Canberra has put on the table  for people smugglers to bring people down illegally from Indonesia, which is what has been happening  since Labor abolished offshore processing, abolished Temporary Protection Visas and refused to act  on their election promise which was to turn the boats around.

Luke Bona

One logical way to return the boats around is to take away the prize at the end isn’t it and the prize at  the end is the ability to live in Australia.

Michael Keenan

Absolutely, the prize is permanent residence in Australia. That is the product that the people smugglers  sell and of course it is a very comprehensive and impressive product and that’s why we need to return  to Temporary Protection Visas because that actually removed their ability to sell that product, which is  what is commanding such high prices from within the international market place for people movement.  You are exactly right; we need to address that issue if we are going to stop the boats from coming,  along with the other issues I mentioned which were offshore processing at Nauru and also turning the  boats back around when it’s safe to do so.

Luke Bona

Here we are 2012, boats are still arriving and there would be boats on the horizon now. Christmas  Island is full correct?

Michael Keenan

There is no question that that facility is again full to overflowing which is of great concern to us as last  time we saw those conditions there the Government actually lost control of that facility and the  Australian Federal Police had to re-take it by force. Christmas Island and the onshore detention  network is full to bursting, even though the Government’s latest policy idea is to actually release people  into the community but even they can't release people into the community fast enough to actually take  the pressure of that detention network just because of the sheer rate of illegal arrivals that we have  seen. We have got serious problems within our detention network and it can only be stopped by  stopping the boats from coming and that remains the heart of the problem.

Luke Bona

I’m talking with the Shadow Immigration spokesmen Michael Keenan who is reminding us that there is  still no sign of the Government doing anything concrete to solve the people smuggling problems. We  need to close of our borders to illegal arrivals. These are not political refugees, they are economic  refugees, would that be the right term?

Michael Keenan

It is impossible to generalise but the point is we need to have a system that is orderly and at the  moment we have a system that is actually run by criminal gangs.

Luke Bona

Can you stop there just a second and can you explain that "it’s run by criminal gangs"?

Michael Keenan

Well people smugglers are very sophisticated criminal gangs who make an enormous sum of money  illegally by bringing people to Australia. When you are seeing prices up to $15 000 per head and boats  of well over 100 people, you can appreciate Luke and I’m sure your listeners appreciate that we are  talking about an incredibly lucrative trade run by very shady and nasty people that care absolutely  nothing for the safety of people they are smuggling down here. They are very sophisticated criminal  gangs they understand what the impact of policy decisions that are taken in Australia is on their

that I have just been talking to you about earlier.

Luke Bona

The Greens will say we need to show compassion for these people, they are getting on leaky boats  and putting their lives at risk because there is no other way for them to get here, well there is, an  aeroplane, but an aeroplane requires a visa and a ticket and a passport.

Michael Keenan

That’s right and it is completely false compassion to say that we should be having policies that  encourage people to come here on leaky boats. We know people have been lost taking this journey,  Australians were reminded of this just recently with that terrible tragedy of the coast of Java and a year  ago we had an equally terrible tragedy at Christmas Island and they are only the boats that we know  that have been lost, there is a lot of anecdotal evidence many others have as well. There is nothing  humanitarian about having a policy that encourages that.

Luke Bona

Thank you for your time, I will let you get back to your holiday and we will talk again in the New Year.

Michael Keenan

Always a pleasure to talk to you Luke.

Luke Bona

Thanks Michael. Michael Keenan the Shadow Immigration spokesmen here on Summer Drive
