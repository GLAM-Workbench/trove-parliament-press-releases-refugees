A year of cruelty, costing billions and lives,  is no victory

Spending billions of dollars locking children in offshore detention slums and denying protection  to as many refugees as possible is the disastrous legacy of the government’s Operation  Sovereign Borders, the Australian Greens have said.

“What we’ve seen from the Abbott government is a year of shocking cruelty,” the Greens’  immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.

“More people are suffering, fewer are being helped, and the Minister is claiming victory.

“Scott Morrison’s mission accomplished moment has cost billions of dollars, two lives on Manus  Island and the mental health of thousands of men, women and children locked up offshore.

“Turning back genuine refugees and forcing them to face danger in their war-torn homelands  does not save lives, no matter how hard the government tries to spin it.

“The Greens want to see refugees processed where they are and then brought to Australia  safely.

“As the situation in Iraq and Syria deteriorates Australia should be accepting more refugees, not  slamming the door in their face.”
