Re: Kosovo Pause and Boat Arrival

Â

Journalist:

Â

Why 
the pause?

Â

Minister:

Â

Well, 
Madam Ogata, who is the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees 
has expressed a desire for a halt to be called to enable the UN to re-evaluate 
the need for relocation of people and she’s asked Australia, the United 
States of America and Canada to do that. I understand each of the other 
Governments have agreed to that course and the Australian Government 
will today suspend the movement of people that we had planned for early 
next week.

Â

The 
officials that we have asked to go to the Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia for this purpose will continue, will be in place. We will 
be in a position to resume processing within 48 hours if that becomes 
necessary but at the moment that request having been made we have suspended 
for the time being our planned movement of these people.

Â

Journalist:

Â

And 
what are the chances of the lifting of the suspension in future?

Â

Minister:

Â

Obviously 
it will depend on the UN’s evaluation. It’s been said that Albania 
in particular have indicated a desire to relocate people who have been 
in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and the European Community 
has indicated a willingness to put in place the resources to assist 
in that task. Obviously it requires the UN to evaluate whether that 
will be able to be achieved in the time frame and successfully with 
the resources that will be there. That’s the reasons for the pause 
and we remain ready to help.

Â

Journalist:

Â

So 
the Australian facilities remain on Standby?

Â

Minister:

Â

They 
certainly do and we will be in a position o resume the processing within 
48 hours if that proves necessary.

Â

Journalist:

Â

Now, 
Australian officials are due to leave for the Balkans tomorrow, will 
they still depart?

Â

Minister:

Â

They 
will still be in place so that this process can resume if required

Â

Journalist:

Â

What 
will become of the money dedicated to this airlift? Minister: If you 
need the resources and they obviously have to be there. Any changes 
in our plans in relation to those matters will be for the Government 
to consider and I think we need time in order to look at those matters.

Â

I described this matter 
earlier in the week as an evolving one and I think you can see that 
from some of the changes that have occurred this was initially a request 
from the UNHCR and it was one we responded to willingly and with good 
reason. This request for a pause has been made and we’ve acceded with 
that in order to give the UN an opportunity to re-evaluate the opportunity 
and if their evaluation ends in a further request from the UN for the 
relocation of people we’ll obviously be ready to participate.

Â

Journalist:

Â

Inaudible?

Â

Minister:

Â

The United Nations 
made this request initially and it was made of all its members. The 
UNHCR Ms Ogata has been over the last several days in the FYROM and 
also Albania, she has requested this pause and we have acceded to it 
but we remain ready and willing to assist and to resume the processing 
of people for resettlement on a temporary basis in Australia if that 
is required.

Â

Journalist:

Â

What’s your reaction 
to the arrival of the boat people?

Â

Minister:

Â

Well obviously it’s 
a matter of concern that such a large number of people have sought to 
enter Australia clandestinely. They came in the middle of the night. 
We have put in place arrangements not only to locate those who entered 
in that way but also to ensure that the people will be removed later 
today to our Port Headland facility. We will then debrief them to find 
out a little more about the arrangements and I’ll have something to 
say about that when I’m in a better position to elaborate on all of 
the details.

Â

Journalist:

Â

Do you think there 
has been another lapse in coastal surveillance?

Â

Minister:

Â

You will recall that 
more than 100 boats have arrived in Australia. This is the fourth that 
has arrived without us knowing in advance of its intention. It’s not 
surprising that from time to time that can happen but the Government 
does regard these matters seriously. We initiated an inquiry after the 
Cairns arrival and obviously this is a matter we will want to look at 
further.
