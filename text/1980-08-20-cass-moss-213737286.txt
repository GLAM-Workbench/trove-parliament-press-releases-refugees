FROM DR MOSS CASS, M P , SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND ETHNIC

AFFAIRS.

"A CHEAP C.E.P.O."

"The Report which, should have been named C.E.P.O. (Cynical Exercise

in Political Opportunism), - the Galbally Report - has given it's

last "promised fruit" to the Government. Designed cunningly to deceive

the ethnic communities so that the maximum benefits were in ifc's

"third" year of implementation - surprise, surprise, an election year -

the only increase in the expenditure of the Department of Immigration

and Ethnic Affairs is due to the Galbally money, (or vote buying

money, if you like)," Dr Cass said.

"One has to make only a very simple calculation to see the real

expenditure on Immigration and Ethnic Affairs.

74,627,810 - Appropriation 1979-80

Y e s , $53 million or to be precise, $1,246,642 less.not even considering

an inflation of some 10%," said Dr Cass.

"Further more it must be emphasised that the Galbally Report was not

prepared for refugee settlement. It was (theoretically) commissioned

to serve the needs of immigrants. The very title states, "Migrant

Services and Programmes". This is not to say that refugees do not

have a genuine claim or indeed a need for Government funding. However,

it is becoming more and more obvious that the money allocated is

being used for refugee settlement: ^Orientation classes for refugee

children', 1  Education for migrant and refugee children1, 'Emergency

classroom accommodation',. 'Language teaching materials','English

training', are but a few of the headings to meet the need of the

increased number of refugees," Dr Cass said.

"It is unfair, to deceive the ethnic communities like this. If the

Government is set on "supplementing" its failing immigration programme

with, an increasing number of refugees it should not be done at the

expense of the ethnic communities. We. should face up and meet fully

our international obligations. At the moment neither the refugees

nor the ethnic communities are getting what they are entitled to,"

said Dr Cass.

"The Treasurer in his speech said that the"migrant intake is expected

to rise to 95,000 in 1980-81." The truth is that the Government

is set on a 3-year target intake of 210,000 immigrants. The last

two years have seen the lowest rates of net immigration to this

country ever (between 40 and 50,000). It is deceitful to include

the refugees, some 21,500, in the immigration target in order to preter

the target is being achieved. They are using refugees to supplement

their failing policies," Dr Cass said.

"Needless to say that of the announced 30,000 Assisted Passages, at

least 21,500 will go to refugees. The rest, going by the past record,

will benefit immigrants coming from the UK and North European

countries," said Dr Cass.

"Even the money, $1.45 million allocated to the much criticised

Institute of Multicultural Affairs - down to the last cent - is

from the "Galbally Money". Many people are questioning the very

existence of (let alone the research done by), the Institute.

Apparently it is going to be another C.E.P.O. (Cynical Exercise in

Political Opportunism), given that they have embarked on a research

programme on "Ethnic Schools and Multicultural Education" to be

ready - by command - in September, just before the election,"

Dr Cass said.

"Multicultural Broadcasting - designed as another C.E.P.O. - and

the allocation of some $24 million is but a further proof of a

thoughtless, unplanned push for the "Ethnic Vote". They could

. .3

have at least waited to read the Senate Committee's Recommendation

before embarking on a spending spree. The ABC itself said that they

can provide cheaper and better programming than the IMBC. Where is

the spirit of saving and economic restraint?" asked Dr C a s s .

"The increase in the translating services o Â£  the Department of

Immigration is indeed a modest one (some $60,000). This is even more

surprising given that to a question asked from all Ministers, I

received the same reply: their Departments are sending all their

translations to the Department of Immigration," Dr Cass said.

Although refugees are to be "settled in the community" there has been

a nearly 50% cut in "reimbursement to voluntary agencies for

assistance to refugees", from $450,000 in 1979-80 to $275,000 this

year.

The receipts of the Department will double this year due mainly to

a 500% increase in Overseas Student Charges introduced by the GovernÂ­

ment last year and an increase of some 100% in what they call

"miscellaneous" but which in reality are the new charges for visas,

passports and return endorsements again introduced last year.

"Again, the Budget is best summed up as a deceitful, cheap exercise  in political opportunism designed for vote buying," said Dr Cass.
