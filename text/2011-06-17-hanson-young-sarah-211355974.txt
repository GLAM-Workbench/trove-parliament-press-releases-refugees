Greens welcome High Court challenge to Malaysian  people swap deal

The Australian Greens have welcomed a High Court challenge to the plan to expel up to 800 asylum  seekers to Malaysia or any other country.

“The Greens have long argued the Gillard government’s Malaysia deal is inhumane because it exports  Australia’s humanity, and now we see the full effect of the proposal which is tearing an Iraqi Kurdish  family apart,” Greens’ immigration spokesperson, Sen. Sarah Hanson-Young, said today.

“The husband and father in this family, who has already been granted refugee status, risks never  seeing his wife and young son again because they are in detention on Christmas Island pending their  expulsion, and he’s stuck in detention in Melbourne waiting for his security clearance.

“The Prime Minister and Immigration Minister have said nearly 300 people already on Christmas  Island since their May 7 Malaysia announcement will be sent to the back of a non-existent queue and  will never be resettled in Australia.

“It’s been nearly six weeks since that deal was trumpeted, and with reports the talks with the UNHCR  and the Malaysian government are in trouble, there’s still time for the Australian government to walk  away.

“Walking away would ensure we honour our international obligations under the Refugee Convention  and stop this waste of taxpayers' money.

“The Greens will pursue our opposition to the Malaysian deal, through our amendment bill  currently before the Parliament, and encourage all concerned members of Parliament to  support it.”
