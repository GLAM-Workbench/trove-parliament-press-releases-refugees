E&OE……………………….……………………………………………………………

TONY ABBOTT:

It’s good to be here in Perth in the week of CHOGM. Today I’ve got a number of bilateral meetings with  senior representatives of some of the governments here at the Commonwealth Heads of Government  meeting. I just want to make a few comments though about some other important issues.

First of all on the carbon tax, I think it’s really significant that the Canadian Foreign Minister said last night  on Australian television that there was no way that Canada is going to introduce a carbon tax. Canada is a  very comparable economy to ours and the fact that Canada is point blank refusing to go down this path  demonstrates that the time for carbon taxes, the time for emissions trading schemes has well and truly passed  and, while I am on the subject, I just make this point that if the Government was serious about reducing  global emissions they would lift the ban on selling uranium to India. If India is able to expand its nuclear  programme, obviously that does make a significant contribution to reducing Indian emissions and I think  that’s something that the Government really should rethink and rethink now.

On the mining tax, it was good to be with Premier Colin Barnett last night and his statement that the mining  tax is probably the most disastrous piece of public policy that he’s seen in his time in public life I think  should be well-heeded by the Government.

Finally, we saw this morning Kevin Rudd was given two occasions on which to support the Government’s  mandatory pre-commitment policy. He pointedly declined to support the Prime Minister’s policy. Obviously  he is using this issue as a wedge in his campaign to retake the Labor leadership.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, obviously the Malaysian swap deal, still not any good in your opinion?

TONY ABBOTT:

We’ve had a very consistent policy for a decade. Our policy is offshore processing at Nauru, temporary  protection visas and the option of turning boats around where it is safe to do so. That has been our position  for a decade and it’s a very good position. It stopped the boats once and it can stop the boats again.

QUESTION:

With Malaysia, our PM is arguing that it will reduce people smuggling and their efforts I suppose. What do  you say to that? Are you still convinced that it’s not going to do any good?

TONY ABBOTT:

This is yet another broken promise from the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister on a number of occasions  before the last election explicitly ruled out sending boat people to any country that hadn’t signed the UN  refugee convention and Malaysia shows not the slightest inclination to do so.

QUESTION:

But still, is it a dud deal? I mean, is that how you would describe it?

TONY ABBOTT:

It’s a great deal for Malaysia but it’s a dud deal for Australia. That’s what we’ve been saying all along here.  It’s a cruel deal for boat people and it’s a dud deal for Australia.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, the Malaysian Prime Minister in comments this morning says that refugees are treated well in  that country despite being a non-signatory to the UNHCR. What do you make of those comments?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think the Malaysian Prime Minister is perfectly entitled to defend his country’s record, he’s perfectly  entitled to speak up for Malaysia’s standards and that’s his right, that’s his entitlement but we in Australia  have different standards and our standards are the ones which we are required to observe in our dealings  with people.

QUESTION:

Back to last night, Mr Abbott. Colin Barnett’s comments in relation to the mining tax. Do you think that was  the right and proper forum for Mr Barnett to criticise perhaps national policy and attack the direction the  country may be heading into?

TONY ABBOTT:

I thought that Colin Barnett was very, very restrained. I thought he was very, very statesmanlike. There were  a lot of other policies that he could have criticised had he chosen to. He could have criticised the carbon tax,  he could have criticised what the Government is doing in respect of pokies as well as criticising the mining  tax. But as far as Western Australia is concerned the mining tax is a disaster for their future and I think it’s  right and proper for the Premier of Western Australia to point that out in no uncertain terms.

This is a divided and directionless government. The fact that the Foreign Minister could not find it is in his  heart today on two occasions or yesterday to support the Prime Minister’s policy on mandatory pre-commitment just makes it crystal clear that this is one of the issues that he’s using to wedge the Prime  Minister out of the leadership. This is one of the issues that he’s using with his colleagues to make the case  that there should be a swift change of the leadership of the Labor Party.
