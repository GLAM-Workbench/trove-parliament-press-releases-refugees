PARLIAMENT OF AUSTRALIA Â· THE SENATE

PR No 90/257 9 July 1990

Statement bv Senator Janet Powell. Leader of the Australian  Democrats:

GQVERNMF.NT SHOULD HELP TO END BOUGAINVILLE BLOCKADE

The Australian Government has been called on to help end the  blockade of Bougainville. The call has come from a world-wide  gathering of community leaders,  peace campaigners, politicians,  unionists, politicians and religious leaders.

A petition circulated yesterday at the ASPAC conference in  Melbourne was signed by 124 delegates from 19 nations: Australia  (all states), Canada, Fiji, France, French Polynesia, Hong Kong,  Japan, Netherlands, New Zealand, Northern Marianas, Papua New

Guinea, Philippines,  Solomon Islands, South Korea, Soviet Union,  Thailand, Tibet, United States and West Germany.

Conference participants were addressed by Bougainvilleans who  recently lost relatives to malaria and appendicitis,  because  medical supplies and transport fuel were not available. The  blockade is causing people to die as surely as by force of arms.

I will present the petition to the Senate when Budget sittings  commence in August.

The text of the petition reads:

We, the undersigned participants of the 1990 ASPAC conference for disarmament, security and cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region, call upon the Australian Governmentj '

- to seek the agreement of the Papua New Guinea government to  lift the blockade which deprives our Bougainvilleas neighbours  of urgently needed medicines, food and fuel supplies, and  splits Bougainvilleas families;

- to encourage the PNG government to uphold its democratic principles by safeguarding the human rights of ,  ^

Bougainvilleans;

- to encourage the PNG government to seek a negotiated political  settlement to resolve the crisis;

- to enlist the active Involvement of the International  Commission of the Red Cross and the united Nations World Food  Program in supplying relief and humanitarian assistance to  Bougainville;

- to grant refugee status to Bougainvilleans stranded In  Australia by the blockade;

- to offer assistance for the reconstruction of Bougainville's ,   destroyed villages on a scale comparable to Australia's  heightened military training program in PNG.
