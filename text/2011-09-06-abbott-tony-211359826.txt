E&OE……………………….…………………………………………………………………

CRAIG HUTH:

Joining us this afternoon, the Opposition Leader Tony Abbott. Good afternoon to you sir and welcome to the  panel.

TONY ABBOTT:

Thanks for having me on Craig.

CRAIG HUTH:

Now, as I was mentioning before, I would not like to be the Prime Minister today picking up the newspapers  because I have never seen in my 20 years on commercial radio such an attack on a government as what I’ve  seen in the last couple of days.

TONY ABBOTT:

But Craig, there’s probably not been a government as inept as this one has been in your 20 years in  commercial radio. In fact, most people seem to think that this is the worst, the most incompetent government  in living memory. Now, that’s a big call. I can remember back to the Whitlam Government and that was a  pretty ordinary government, but Gough Whitlam at least had some ideals and he had some principles and he  never sold out to the Greens the way this Prime Minister has.

CRAIG HUTH:

Now, it’s very interesting when you sit back Tony and have a look at a lot of the debacle that’s happened  with this Government, of course we’ve seen the moment where Kevin Rudd was taken out as Prime Minister  and Julia Gillard then stepped into the shoes of Prime Minister but looking at the big picture here, does  anyone really want to step into her shoes right now, from the Government in what - can I use one of your  words - a toxic time, when it comes for the Government?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I hope that the government of this country can be a lot more competent than that which we’ve got at  the moment and either someone has got to step up inside the Labor Party and change the policy and if that’s  impossible, well, I really think that the country would be much better off if we could have a change of  government and the best way to bring that about would be an election. You know I don’t run a commentary  on polls, Craig, but it is interesting that all of the recent polls show that a plurality of voters would prefer an  election because it seems that minority government is an experiment that’s failed. You’ve got a Prime  Minister who’s now trying to ram through the parliament a tax that she had a mandate not to introduce and I  think the public are going to lose faith in our polity if this Government continues for much longer and that  would be a very, very bad thing because in the end we can’t always agree with our governments, we don’t  always like them but you’ve got to have a basic respect for the system and when you’ve got a Government  which is showing as much contempt for the system as this one is that bodes ill for our country.

CRAIG HUTH:

Now, what discussions have you had with the Government, with the Prime Minister to discuss the debacle  over the failed Malaysia deal? Now, it’s in the paper absolutely everywhere at the moment. Can we get this  back on track? Will Nauru be reopened again or has this High Court decision completely cancelled out any  overseas sending of the asylum seekers that are on Christmas Island now and many more are starting to  arrive as well?

TONY ABBOTT:

Craig, look, the High Court decision certainly doesn’t rule out Nauru. It certainly doesn’t rule out Nauru,  and I make three points about Nauru. First of all, Nauru did happen under the existing legislation. Second,  since Nauru was previously in operation it signed the UN Convention on Refugees and I think the High  Court would regard that as a material fact and, third, Nauru has a legal system which is essentially the same  as Australia’s. We have Australian judges sitting on the Nauruan Supreme Court, and the court of appeal for  Nauru is in fact the High Court of Australia. So this idea that Nauru is some kind of a tin pot, third world  dictatorship is just absolutely wrong. Nauru has a very, very good legal system and it’s essentially ours. So  the idea that the High Court would regard Nauru as not having acceptable legal standards, I think, is pretty  far-fetched.

CRAIG HUTH:

Now, the left in the Government at the moment certainly want to see processing on the mainland. The  Greens of course must have been cracking champagne bottles open when the High Court decision was  announced. How will the Prime Minister move now, with the Greens on one side, the other members of her  party on the other side saying, “hey, we want this on the mainland. We don’t want overseas help with this.”  How does she move now and how does she work in with you and we’re hearing that you’re going to do  some sort of deal with the Government to get things on track. Is that right?

TONY ABBOTT:

Craig, she needs to make a decision. Now, all her decisions so far have been bad ones. There was the  original East Timor decision which was a bad one. Then there was the Manus decision which probably  wasn’t a bad decision but she hasn’t been able to bring it to fruition. Then of course there was the Malaysia  decision which has turned out to be an absolute disaster and no one likes Malaysia except the Prime Minister  and Chris Bowen. Now, if she really wants to go down the offshore processing path - and I think she should  because that’s an important element in any range of policies to stop the boats - we will work with her to put  the whole thing beyond legal doubt. I don’t think the High Court’s decision rules out Nauru by any means  but if she thinks it does she’s perfectly entitled - and I would encourage her to do so - to pick up the phone  to me, say this is what we want to do, this is the legislation that we think needs to pass through the

parliament to put beyond doubt offshore processing, talk to me about it and I will be constructive and  cooperative because I don’t want to see a situation where the Australian Government has no policy  whatsoever on border protection and that’s the very unfortunate situation we’re in now and the only people  who win from that are the people smugglers.

CRAIG HUTH:

I would be interested to know, if these negotiations took place, would you be happy to take these 4, 000  people which we pledged that we would take from Malaysia or would you say no at this stage?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I’m not happy about it but then I was never happy about any aspect of the Malaysia deal but I fear the  Government has made commitments to Malaysia which we can’t get out of. Malaysia, I presume, stood  ready to take the 800. They can’t do it because we can’t send them thanks to the High Court, but we made a  commitment to Malaysia and I think we’re bound by it. It’s a commitment that the Government should never  have made because they should never have agreed to the people swap in the first place, but having made the  commitment I don’t think we can get out of it.

CRAIG HUTH:

I’m interested to know, with Chris Bowen, should Chris Bowen step down from what he is doing? I know  this has been asked in the media quite a bit, and where did they really go wrong in that department? Did they  get the wrong legal advice, you know? Surely, they must have got, you know, comprehensive advice when it  comes to doing this deal with Malaysia.

TONY ABBOTT:

This is a very good question, Craig, and it’s interesting that they’ve been prepared to publish the Solicitor-General’s advice after the High Court decision but the really need to publish the advice they got before the  High Court decision. Now, I’ve written to the Prime Minister requesting that that advice and all the other  advice they got be released and if the Prime Minister’s fair dinkum about accountability that’s what she  should do. You can’t just have a selective release of legal advice because either the advice was very bad or  the Government has made a monumentally stupid decision because plainly the High Court very  comprehensively ruled out the Malaysia deal.

CRAIG HUTH:

What do we do in a situation now if this takes a long period of time which we are talking legally it could,  when we are getting more of the boats arriving each week and if Christmas Island then starts to fill up,  where do we send them? How long is this process going to take and how much is it going to cost the  Australian taxpayer?

TONY ABBOTT:

We know, Craig, that since the Government watered down John Howard’ effective border protection laws,  we’ve had something like 240 boats and more than 12,000 illegal arrivals. Now, the boats will just keep  coming until an effective border protection policy is put in place and the Coalition’s border protection policy  involves Nauru, temporary protection visas and the option of turning boats around where that is safe to do  so. Now, the Government so far has only embraced offshore processing and it now says it can’t do it  because of the High Court. Now, I’ve said to the Government, I’m not going to insist that you adopt  temporary protection visas. I’m not going to insist that you turn boats around, although I think it would be  better if you did, but if you want offshore processing and if you think that Nauru and Manus - and  remember Manus was in fact the Government’s policy - if you think Nauru and Manus are impossible under

the Act as it stands, let’s look at changing it. So, I’m trying to be as constructive as I can here but the ball is  now in the Prime Minister’s court and as well as talking to the president of Nauru and other Nauruan  officials at the Pacific Islands Forum, I’d invite the Prime Minister to pick up the phone because we will  respond constructively to a proposal that she might put but she’s got to put a proposal to us.

CRAIG HUTH:

Are we expecting to see some sort of a meeting between you and the Prime Minister before the next sitting?  Is this going to be reasonably quick?

TONY ABBOTT:

Craig, it’s entirely in her hands. I mean, I’ve indicated now repeatedly over the last couple of days that I’m  prepared to talk and I will try to be as constructive as I humanly can here but she is the Prime Minister. They  are the Government. In the end, you can’t save the country from Opposition, so I’m prepared to ensure that  there is no possible legislative obstacle to reopening Nauru, to reopening Manus, to having an effective  system of third country offshore processing.

CRAIG HUTH:

Tony Abbott, always a pleasure.

TONY ABBOTT:

Good on you, Craig.
