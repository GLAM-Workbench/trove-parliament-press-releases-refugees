TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW - CHANNEL 10 MORNING NEWS WITH NATARSHA  BELLING

SUBJECT:  CRAIG THOMSON; CARBON PRICE; IMMIGRATION; OPPOSITION  BUDGET BLACK HOLE.

E  & O E - PROOF ONLY



BELLING: Joining us now for our regular Friday political debate are Finance Minister  Penny Wong in our Melbourne studio, good morning Minister.

WONG: Good morning Natarsha.

BELLING: And shadow immigration minister Scott Morrison in Sydney. Thank you to both  of you.

MORRISON: Hi.

BELLING: First to you, Senator Wong, now how long can the Government stand by Mr  Thomson? Some sceptics may say if he’s actually forced out of Parliament it’s more about  the fact that Labor could actually lose Government.

WONG: Mr Thomson is a valued member of our caucus. There is an investigation by Fair  Work Australia, that’s on the public record, and we should let that investigation proceed.  Allegations have been made, and allegations have been denied, but the reality is I don’t  think even the Opposition is calling for Mr Thomson’s resignation.

BELLING: Mr Morrison, are you calling for his resignation considering there are allegations  he did use a union credit card to pay for these services?

MORRISON: Well I think the question here is really for the Prime Minister. I mean the  Prime Minister has stood in the Parliament and says she has complete confidence, she has  absolutely welded herself to Mr Thomson. And the Coalition has been asking her, well how  has she formed this view? What questions has she asked, when did she ask them, when  did she know, and when did she approve of the payment made to Mr Thomson by the ALP.

I mean these are questions that I think the public are asking, we’re asking, the Prime  Minister’s answering none of them, and I think it’s a real issue of judgment. She’s made this  call about Mr Thomson, I think she needs to satisfy Australians how she’s made that call.

BELLING: But should he resign, are you calling for him to resign?

MORRISON: There are many questions out there at the moment. He’s answering none, the  Prime Minister’s answering none, the shutters have gone up, and I think people are sitting  back and wondering about the transparency of this Government.

BELLING: So you’re not calling for him to resign at this stage.

MORRISON: Well I think at this stage there are just serious, serious questions and the  Labor Party has put up the shutters. Now I think it’s important if the Prime Minister’s going  to stand there and say I have complete confidence in this person, that she should be able to  justify why she has that view. And she hasn’t responded to any question that could lead us  to forming the same conclusion.

BELLING: Senator Wong, on to the other big issues this week. We saw that massive anti-carbon tax rally in Canberra. We’ve also seen the controversy continue over the Malaysia  solution. With the situation with that at the moment, if the High Court does strike down your  Malaysia solution, where are you going to stand on this very controversial issue?

WONG: No one should doubt our resolve to implement this policy and to break the people  smugglers’ model. We think that’s the right thing to do. Obviously the matter is before the  High Court, as have been previous matters under the Howard Government when they were  in Government too. Obviously the Court will make its decision, but no one should doubt our  resolve.

I do want to make a comment about the carbon rally, Natarsha, that you mentioned at the  beginning of your question. Obviously this is a reform that is difficult and tough, and there  are people who oppose it, particularly Tony Abbott. I would say though, I’ve seen today that  Mr Abbott has, on one of his blogs, had a go at the Prime Minister for not attending the  rally. That really is a cheap shot. He would well know that the Prime Minister was attending  a funeral on that day, and it’s a pity that he’s chosen to take such a cheap shot that’s really  not worthy of him.

BELLING: Senator Wong, just speaking about the carbon tax, I know I’ve asked you this  question before. If the Prime Minister and the Gillard Government is so passionate that they  believe they are on the right track with the carbon tax, why not put it to the people? Call an  election over it?

WONG: Natarsha, we have spoken about this. We went to the last election saying we  wanted to price carbon. We believed that that was the best way to reach the emissions  reductions target that Tony Abbott’s also signed up to. Remember Scott and Tony and all  the Opposition also want to reduce emissions, the difference is they’ve chosen a scheme  that will actually cost taxpayers more. And we’ve gone through the reasons for that.

This is a reform that’s important for not just this generation of Australians, but our children  and our grandchildren. This is about changing our economy to a clean energy economy.

And in years to come, that’s important not only for the climate, but also for our economic  prosperity. You can’t be a first rate economy if you’re not a clean energy economy.

BELLING: Mr Morrison, do you believe the Government is just being held to ransom by the  Greens though over this?

MORRISON: Well I think that has been the case ever since this Government was formed.  But to pick Penny up on one point, it’s actually the Government’s scheme that leads to an  increase in domestic emissions in Australia. The Coalition’s scheme, our direct action plan  leads to a reduction in domestic -

WONG: No one believes that Scott.

MORRISON:  They’re your figures Penny.

WONG: (laughs) No one believes you.

MORRISON: They’re your figures.

WONG: No one believes that your scheme will -

MORRISON: Your emissions will go up by 2020 and our emissions domestically go down  by 2020.

WONG: No one is backing your scheme Scott, except the Liberal Party.

MORRISON: So a big tax for no -

WONG: Our economy -

MORRISON: Our scheme will reduce domestic emissions, will yours Penny?

WONG: No one believes that. No one believes that. The thing is that you’re putting forward  a scheme that not a single economist supports.

MORRISON: I think the Government is a having a problem with people believing it Penny.

BELLING: Now in regards to - if I can just, sorry, pardon me - in regards to the boat  arrivals, the situation Mr Morrison. Statistics show boat arrivals are down by about two-thirds on last year. Do you believe the Government’s actions are actually slowing the  boats?

MORRISON: No I don’t because they’re still significantly up on what was happening in  2009. I mean 2010 was a record year, which the Government set. The problem the  Government has here is I mean, I think the jury is out on the result, and the jury is out at the  High Court as well. But the jury is in when it comes to their competence in handling these  issues. I mean the Malaysian solution has been bungled from word go. We’re about to enter  a new round of back foot, open cheque book negotiations with PNG rather than simply  picking up the phone to Nauru once again. So the Government’s competence in handling  these issues, I think the public has completely lost confidence and trust and that’s the issue

they now face. Because even when they know they’ve got it wrong, as they have for the last  three years, and they’ve openly acknowledged that now, with the seeking to change  policies, they just can’t seem to get it right.

BELLING: Senator Wong, do you believe you can get it right?

WONG: I do, and this is a tough policy area and Chris Bowen is doing an excellent job in  what is a very tough policy area. But can I just respond to Scott. He talks about competence  and blank cheques. You know, the biggest blank cheque is the $70 billion black hole that  the Coalition has created for themselves in their costings.

When we hear Joe Hockey talking about $70 billion that he has to find let’s be clear - that’s  because they haven’t done the hard work on savings. They haven’t done the hard work in  terms of costing their policy. They’ve opposed savings measures of the Government. And  Tony Abbott has made a whole range of promises he now can’t fund. So if you want to talk  about blank cheques, there is a $70 billion blank cheque that the Coalition has to find the  money to fill because they haven’t done the hard economic yards.

MORRISON: Well as you know Penny, when you don’t tax people, you don’t have to spend  money on compensating them. And you know that that is a big component of the figures  we’re talking about here. And the Australian people know it, if you don’t tax them, you don’t  have to compensate them. And I think the key compensation they’re looking for is a tax  abolished so their jobs won’t be lost, so their electricity prices won’t go up. Now if we’re  talking about misleading, the Prime Minister said, the NSW Treasury figures that show that  30,000 jobs will be lost in NSW were based on old numbers. Now that, as you know, is not  true. The NSW Treasury figures were based on the exact figures that this Government has  put out for their exact tax, their exact price and the exact compensation measures so she  should fess up.

BELLING: Mr Morrison, Senator Wong, I have to interrupt. Super, super quickly; we’ve run  out of time. I just want to end though on Senator Wong saying congratulations to you and  your partner Sophie with the news you’re expecting a baby. Have you been quite surprised  by the reaction to this announcement?

WONG: It’s always, obviously, a little bit disconcerting to have to talk about private things  so publicly. But I did want to say Natarsha, thank you for your congratulations and thank  you to the so many Australians who have contacted, and emailed, and written to us passing  on their congratulations. We really appreciate it.

BELLING: Yes, Scott?

MORRISON: Can I just add to that. I think Penny, this is a very private matter and I  commend you on the way you’ve handled it. But we wish you and your partner all the best.

WONG: Thank you.

BELLING: Beautiful. Now I could chat to both of you all day, we’ve run out of time once  again. Thanks so much for joining us this morning, have a lovely weekend.
