Â

VISIT TO INDONESIA

Â

I will visit Indonesia on 23-24 January for discussions with my Indonesian 
counterpart, Dr Aiwi Shihab, and to meet the leaders of Indonesia’s 
recently  elected Government and Parliament and to exchange views 
on how to develop the bilateral relationship.

Â

The visit will be my first to Jakarta since the new 
Indonesian Government assumed office late last year.

Â

Separate meetings will be held with President Abdurrahman 
Wahid and the Speaker of the People’s Representative Council, Mr Akbar 
Tanjung, and other Cabinet Ministers.

Â

I am looking forward to seeing Dr Shihab again and 
to continuing the constructive dialogue we began in Macau in December.

Â

Meetings will also be held with senior business representatives 
to discuss how to further strengthen our bilateral trade, commercial 
and investment links. These links are already significant and prospects 
for further growth are improving as the Indonesian economy recovers.
