APPOINTMENTS TO REFUGEE REVIEW TRIBUNAL

The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Senator Nick Bolkus, has announced the appointment of 16 full-time and eight part-time members to the new Refugee Review Tribunal.

The independent Tribunal replaces the existing Refugee Status Review Committees and will commence operation on July 1 1993.

Senator Bolkus said the appointments to the Tribunal reflected an outstanding field of talent and experience in immigration and refugee law, as well as community advocacy.

"I am particularly pleased to note that women make up 50 per cent of the membership, and that members come from a diverse range of cultural backgrounds," he said.

"All are well-qualified to contribute to a credible and independent determination system which should help keep to a minimum appeals to the courts."

Operating on a non-adversarial basis along guidelines similar to those of the Immigration Review Tribunal, the Refugee Review Tribunal will be completely independent.  It will provide

hearings for applicants, assess applications on their merits, and have the power to decide appeals.

The full-time members of the Tribunal and their former positions are:

Ms Agnes Borsody, member of the Veterans' Review Board;

Mr Graham Brewer, member of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal;

Ms Judith Buss, Assistant Director of the Compensation and Review Branch, Department of Veterans' Affairs;

Mr Domenic Calabro, part-time legal member, Social Security Appeals Tribunal;

Mr Andrew Endrey, director, People's Republic of China Section, Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs;

Dr Lyn Fong, counsel- Human Rights Branch, Civil Law Division, Attorney General's Department;
