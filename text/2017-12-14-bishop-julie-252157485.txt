WINNERS OF THE MIKTA EDUCATION IN EMERGENCIES CHALLENGE

Today I announce the winners of the MIKTA (Mexico, Indonesia, Korea, Turkey,  Australia) Education in Emergencies Challenge which called for new ideas to improve  access to education for children in emergency situations, particularly girls.

Protracted conflict and violence, as well as natural disasters including drought and  floods, have caused a record number of people to flee their homes and have disrupted  the education of more than 75 million children across 35 countries. In these  environments, girls are 2.5 times more likely to be out of school than boys.



Australia has led this open, global innovation challenge on behalf of the five MIKTA  countries.  We received 382 entries, with 72 shortlisted and considered by an  international expert panel. Seven winners have been selected to share in the $2 million  challenge fund.

Successful proposals include:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ a play-based learning kit for children with disabilities in the Pacific;  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ a refugee-led program helping Syrian youths build a sense of safety and self-empowerment through storytelling, self-awareness, and entrepreneurship;  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ training for education leaders in the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu to help them

continue to provide education in emergency situations; and  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ a phone app for humanitarian workers to log educational data, identify barriers  to education and communicate their findings to other aid workers.

More information about the MIKTA Education in Emergencies Challenge and challenge  winners is available here.
