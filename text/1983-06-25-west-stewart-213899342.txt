STUDIES ON ENGLISH LANGUAGE NEEDS RELEASED'Â·

The future of the Adult Migrant Education Program will be  influenced by a number of studies released today by the  Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs,  Stewart West.

"The studies provide insights into the language needs of  migrants and refugees which were not previously available  to program planners" the Minister said. Ã¢ÂÂ   Ã¢ÂÂ

"The Government's commitment to increased child care  provisions and courses-in-industry is supported by these  studies". Â·

"For example,  the report Childminding in the AMEP emphasises  the need for adequate support services to ensure that the  opportunities which the AMEP offered can be taken up by all  migrants including migrant women" Mr West said. "The study

showed that 96 percent of migrant women needing English . classes said that they would attend if child care was  available". 1  '  :

"Another area of particular concern to the Government is  the provision of English language instruction in the  workplace. One of the studies ,  English Language Learning Â·   in the Illawarra,  highlights the magnitude o f .the urgent

need for more classes to help people learn the English  needed in their jobs", Mr West said. ;

Because many of the studies commissioned under the AMEP  Research and Evaluation Program are of interest to the wider  community,  most will be published as a special series through  the Australian Government Publishing Service.
