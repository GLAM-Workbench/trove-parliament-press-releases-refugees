DIPLOMATIC APPOINTMENT: AMBASSADOR TO BRAZIL

I have today announced the appointment of Mr Peter Heyward as Australia’s Ambassador to  the Federative Republic of Brazil with non-resident accreditation to Colombia.  He will  replace Mr John Sullivan, who has been Ambassador since July 2002.  Mr Heyward is  expected to take up his appointment in July 2005.

Australia and Brazil share a long history of close cooperation, with 2005 marking the 60th  anniversary of diplomatic relations between our two countries.  Brazil is Australia’s largest  trading partner in South America, with two-way trade exceeding $1.1 billion in 2004.   Australian exports to Brazil are dominated by resources, particularly coal, nickel and crude  petroleum, but also include passenger vehicles and medicaments.  Australian investment in  Brazil, while mainly concentrated in the mining and resources sector, has diversified into  areas such as agribusiness and financial services.  In 2004, Australia’s education institutions  hosted 4,713 Brazilian students and there is scope to expand these links.

Australia and Brazil share a number of  foreign and trade policy goals including UN reform  and a mutual commitment to agricultural trade liberalisation through the WTO Doha Round  of negotiations.  Brazil is an active partner in the Cairns Group.  We are strengthening  cooperation in science and technology, and work together to enhance trade and investment  links through the CER-Mercosur dialogue, which commenced in 1996 and brings together  officials from Australia, New Zealand, Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay.

Brazil has the largest economy in South America and is a strong proponent of regional  development and integration.  It is a member of Mercosur, the South American Community of  Nations, and is an active participant in regional trade negotiations such as the Free Trade Area  of the Americas (FTAA).

Mr  Heyward  is  a  senior  staff  member  of  the  Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  He  most recently held the position of Assistant Secretary, Environment Branch (2002-2004), and  prior to this was Counsellor and Australia’s Deputy Permanent Representative to the UN in  Geneva  (2000-2002).   He  has  also  held  the  positions  of  Director,  Human  Rights  and   Indigenous Issues Section (1998-2000), Director, Refugees, Immigration and Asylum Section  (1996-1998),  First  Secretary,  later  Counsellor  in  Buenos  Aires  (1993-1996),  Executive   Officer,  Climate  Change  and  Biodiversity  Section  (1991-1992)  and  Desk  Officer,  Antarctic   Section (1989-1991).

Mr  Heyward  was  born  in  Brighton,  UK  in  1955,  he  holds  a  Bachelor  of  Arts  from  the   University of Tasmania and is married with two children.
