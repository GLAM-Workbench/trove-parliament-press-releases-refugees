BEN FORDHAM:

How are you Prime Minister?

PRIME MINISTER:

Hi Ben, good to be with you.

BEN FORDHAM:

Is it really great?

PRIME MINISTER:

It is great, what are you talking about, itÃ¢ÂÂs great, a beautiful day.

BEN FORDHAM:

Alright now IÃ¢ÂÂll make this phone call much more pleasant than one you allegedly had  at the weekend okay?

PRIME MINISTER:

Yeah okay.

BEN FORDHAM:

Were you rattled at all when the US President was giving you a spray?

PRIME MINISTER:

Look, let me just run through the facts here. I had a call with President Trump on  Sunday morning our time. The President committed to honour the refugee  resettlement deal that had been made by his predecessor Barack Obama. On  Wednesday morning our time the PresidentÃ¢ÂÂs spokesman Mr Sean Spicer confirmed  that the President had given that commitment, the arrangements would go forward and  he did that in the White House briefing room. Today the US Embassy in Canberra  stated PresidentÃ¢ÂÂs TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs decision to honour the refugee agreement has not changed  and spokesman SpicerÃ¢ÂÂs comments stand. This was confirmed to the state Department  from the White House and onto this Embassy at 1:15 Canberra time. Now as far as the  call is concerned -

BEN FORDHAM:

Hang on, just so while youÃ¢ÂÂre going along that timeline, youÃ¢ÂÂve seen Twitter this  afternoon?

PRIME MINISTER:

I have indeed, yep. I have.

BEN FORDHAM:

Donald Trump says: “Do you believe it? The Obama Administration agreed to take  thousands of illegal immigrants from Australia. Why? I will study this dumb deal.”

PRIME MINISTER:

Well thatÃ¢ÂÂs his tweet. IÃ¢ÂÂm telling you what has been said to us and whatÃ¢ÂÂs been said by  his spokesman and what has been said by his embassy.

BEN FORDHAM:

ItÃ¢ÂÂs concerning thatÃ¢ÂÂs coming from the President himself though.

PRIME MINISTER:

Well let me just go on. As far as the call is concerned, IÃ¢ÂÂm very disappointed that there  has been a leak of purported details of the call in Washington. But I want to make one  observation about it. The report that the President hung up is not correct. The call  ended courteously. As far as the nature of the discussion, it was very frank and  forthright. I stand up for AustraliaÃ¢ÂÂs interests. I make AustraliaÃ¢ÂÂs case as powerfully  and persuasively as I can, wherever I am.

BEN FORDHAM:

Laura Jayes from Sky News is reporting via “government sources” that is wasnÃ¢ÂÂt a  one-way spray, that you gave as good as you copped?

PRIME MINISTER:

Well the only -

BEN FORDHAM:

And you were just saying you stand up for Australia so -

PRIME MINISTER:

I do.

BEN FORDHAM:

Is that a fair characterisation?

PRIME MINISTER:

I do stand up for Australia but I can assure you that the call was courteous. ThereÃ¢ÂÂs a  lot of talk around about the call allegedly from people that were not party to it. These  calls generally remain, naturally, completely confidential so I am -

BEN FORDHAM:

[Laughs]

Naturally!

PRIME MINISTER:

I am surprised and disappointed that there has been a leak of what purports to be  details of the call in Washington. But I am not going to - the only point I want to  make though is that the suggestion the President hung up is not correct. The call ended  courteously.

BEN FORDHAM:

I must say that did surprise me I mean it sounded a bit unusual. I do note though  Prime Minister that youÃ¢ÂÂre singling out that part of the Washington Post story to deny  it, but youÃ¢ÂÂre not singling out any other aspect.

PRIME MINISTER:

Well the problem is that -look - we have very, very strong standards in the way we  deal with other leaders. We are not about to reveal details of conversations, you know,  other than in a manner that is agreed. Now the commitment made by the President in  that call was made. It was given to us. We announced that. That was confirmed by his  spokesman, you know, a day or so later.

BEN FORDHAM:

Sure. Sounds like heÃ¢ÂÂs having a little bit of regret though.

PRIME MINISTER:

Well youÃ¢ÂÂve got to remember that what the President is doing - and I thanked him for  that - he committed to honour a deal done by his predecessor that no doubt he would  say that he would not have done himself. But he committed to stick to the deal that  President Obama has done. ItÃ¢ÂÂs a very important deal because it will enable many  people who are on Nauru and Manus, potentially to be able to be resettled in the  United States. So itÃ¢ÂÂs a very important deal for them. ItÃ¢ÂÂs one that we secured with the  Obama Administration. I have made the case as powerfully and persuasively as I can  to maintain it with the Trump Administration.

BEN FORDHAM:

Sounds like you were very persuasive considering he thinks this is the worst deal ever  and heÃ¢ÂÂs now blowing up about it, describing it as a “dumb deal”. But in between  those two, and while you had him on the other end of the phone, you got him across  the line.

PRIME MINISTER:

Well IÃ¢ÂÂm very pleased that he made that commitment and I thanked him for it.

BEN FORDHAM:

I thought you were about to say youÃ¢ÂÂre very persuasive.

PRIME MINISTER:

[Laughs]

Well, thatÃ¢ÂÂs for others to judge.

BEN FORDHAM:

Did President Trump tell you itÃ¢ÂÂs the worst deal ever?

PRIME MINISTER:

Look IÃ¢ÂÂm not going to go into the contents of the call Ben. YouÃ¢ÂÂve got to -

BEN FORDHAM:

Well can I ask you this then, did he say to you that his conversation with you was one  of the worst calls by far?

PRIME MINISTER:

[Laughs]

IÃ¢ÂÂm not going to go into any details of the conversation.

BEN FORDHAM:

ThatÃ¢ÂÂd be an easy one to deny

PRIME MINISTER:

No, no.

BEN FORDHAM:

You denied that he hung up on you.

PRIME MINISTER:

Well Ben, itÃ¢ÂÂs very important for me to advance AustraliaÃ¢ÂÂs interests. My job as Prime  Minister is to defend AustraliaÃ¢ÂÂs interests and everything I do has got to be done with  the purpose of ensuring that Australians and AustraliaÃ¢ÂÂs national interests are  protected. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs what I seek to do. So I make AustraliaÃ¢ÂÂs case frankly, powerfully,  forthrightly, hopefully persuasively when I deal with other leaders but what I donÃ¢ÂÂt do  is indulge public commentary, thatÃ¢ÂÂs for others to do because I donÃ¢ÂÂt think that will  necessarily advance AustraliaÃ¢ÂÂs national interests.

BEN FORDHAM:

Everyone is wondering now how this can be rescued. I guess you are wondering the  same thing, do you pick up the phone again or is that done and dusted?

PRIME MINISTER:

We have a commitment from the US President, confirmed several times now by their  Government -

BEN FORDHAM:

But you know he said this afternoon, itÃ¢ÂÂs there for everyone to read, he says this is a  “dumb deal” so he is back-tracking. HeÃ¢ÂÂs crab walking away from it.

PRIME MINISTER:

No I donÃ¢ÂÂt think thatÃ¢ÂÂs -

BEN FORDHAM:

I think he is. I think any observer would say that heÃ¢ÂÂs made it clear at 3 oÃ¢ÂÂclock this  afternoon our time, he doesnÃ¢ÂÂt want a bar of this.

PRIME MINISTER:

Ben this is not a deal that he wouldÃ¢ÂÂve done or that he would regard as a good deal but  -



BEN FORDHAM:

So what makes you think that heÃ¢ÂÂll honour it?

PRIME MINISTER:

This is what he is saying, but the question is, will he commit to honour the deal and he  has given that commitment. And I just want to make this point and this is a very  important point. The deal with - and Spokesman Spicer made this point indeed the  other day - the deal with the Americans has always proceeded on the basis that every  person considered as part of the refugee resettlement process will be accessed  rigorously and thoroughly through the AmericanÃ¢ÂÂs own security vetting system. We  do that with people who come to Australia, they do that with people who come to  America, that is absolutely their right, itÃ¢ÂÂs their duty to their own people. And so all of  the concerns about security are perfectly well able to be met and it is up to the

Americans as to which of those people - for whom we are seeking to find a  resettlement option - which of those people they decide to take.

BEN FORDHAM:

What do you do now, do you dispatch Foreign Minister Julie Bishop to Washington to  finalise the detail once and for all, what do you do?

PRIME MINISTER:

The officials are working - the deal is underway, there have already been American  officials on Nauru as you know and the officials have been working in Washington  this week so -

BEN FORDHAM:

IÃ¢ÂÂd leave President Trump alone for 24 hours, he needs to cool down. He sounds  cranky.

PRIME MINISTER:

Thanks for the advice Ben. My job as Prime Minister is to defend our interests.  America is our most important ally. We have very frank discussions with our ally. I  stand up for our interests and express our point of view and American Presidents do  the same from their perspective. But it is very important that everyone understands  that I stand up for Australia. I defend our interests with whomever IÃ¢ÂÂm dealing.  Whether it is the President of the United States or anybody else.

BEN FORDHAM:

You spoke at lunchtime yesterday about the need for transparency in political  donations while refusing to say how much you donated to the Liberal Party during the  last election. Then you changed your mind last night and admitted it was $1.75  million. What changed between 12.30 and 7.30?

PRIME MINISTER:

Well the donations Ben, the donations that I have made in the course of this financial  year and ordinary course of events wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt be released until early 2018 -

BEN FORDHAM:

Understood, but why did you change your mind? What was it?

PRIME MINISTER:

Ben the circumstances were appropriate and IÃ¢ÂÂve made a - the disclosure is there. ItÃ¢ÂÂs  made literally a year ahead of time and so thatÃ¢ÂÂs the fact and IÃ¢ÂÂm proud to say that IÃ¢ÂÂve  been prepared to put my money, my after-tax money where my mouth is. Standing up  for the values of the Liberal Party and the values of the Government which is so  important for AustraliaÃ¢ÂÂs future.

BEN FORDHAM:

Do you plan on donating again to the Liberal Party?

PRIME MINISTER:

I think itÃ¢ÂÂs very likely that I will be a donor in the future. I think itÃ¢ÂÂs always - if youÃ¢ÂÂre  on my side of politics - I think itÃ¢ÂÂs always likely that youÃ¢ÂÂll do it again. But look -

BEN FORDHAM:

Well you donÃ¢ÂÂt have the union movement tipping too much cash IÃ¢ÂÂm guessing?

PRIME MINISTER:

We donÃ¢ÂÂt. The reality is and you guys in the media know this very well - Labor and  the unions and GetUp and so forth outspent us massively. One network told me they  outspent us 3-to-1. And thatÃ¢ÂÂs certainly what it looked like if youÃ¢ÂÂre looking at the run  of all the ads on television during the campaign. So we are massively outmatched in  financial terms.

But of course the big difference is that Shorten is now a wholly owned subsidiary of  several very left-wing unions. Of course, the CFMEU, a leading one among them and  he has to do their bidding. Now the big difference between him and me in this respect  is that I am my own man. I canÃ¢ÂÂt be bought. When we needed more resources, I was  able to commit them myself.

BEN FORDHAM:

Okay, IÃ¢ÂÂve only got about five minutes - I want to squeeze in five questions. LetÃ¢ÂÂs see  how we go. Bill Shorten said on Wednesday he wanted to rescue the state of politics  and rise above the current standards. 24 hours later he was calling you “Mr  Harbourside Mansion”. He didnÃ¢ÂÂt rise above it for long did he?

PRIME MINISTER:

No he didnÃ¢ÂÂt. HeÃ¢ÂÂs sinking very quickly. Look, he just wants to run an old politics of  envy campaign. The fact is like any socialist he wants to live in a harbourside mansion  but he wants to live in one that is paid for by the taxpayer.

BEN FORDHAM:

Did you just call Bill Shorten a socialist?

PRIME MINISTER:

Indeed.

BEN FORDHAM:

YouÃ¢ÂÂve got the Bronwyn BishopÃ¢ÂÂs about you. She blames everything on socialism  these days.

PRIME MINISTER:

Well, you know what Margaret Thatcher said? She said, “The problem with socialists  is that eventually you run out of other peopleÃ¢ÂÂs money.” And thatÃ¢ÂÂs basically the  problem with the Labor Party now.

BEN FORDHAM:

Alright. What are you going to do about these poor farmers in Queensland who have  been told that their land may be compulsorily acquired to give to the Singaporean  Army for war games and training? Some of these families have had the properties in  their families for 140 years - youÃ¢ÂÂre not going to kick them out of their homes are  you?

PRIME MINISTER:

The Defence Department and the Defence Minister have been up there. They are  talking to land owners. Obviously the aim is to reach land acquisition agreements that  are consensual, that people are happy with and I just want to say that while these  expanded training grounds will be used by Singaporean forces when they are training  here as part of our arrangements with them - they belong to the Australian Defence  Forces. They belong to us and theyÃ¢ÂÂll of course be used by our forces as well.

BEN FORDHAM:

So the compulsory acquisitions are going ahead?

PRIME MINISTER:

ItÃ¢ÂÂs all in the state of process of negotiation and I donÃ¢ÂÂt want to run a commentary on  that. Marise Payne has got it under hand.

BEN FORDHAM:

There are accusations the Defence Department has grabbed a lot of land over the years  that they havenÃ¢ÂÂt really used or looked after and there is overgrown vegetation in those  areas now which is why they are now trying to get fresh prime agricultural land. I  mean, can you really look these people in the eye and say: Ã¢ÂÂYouÃ¢ÂÂre outÃ¢ÂÂ after 90 years,  140 years? To give it to Singapore?

PRIME MINISTER:

Ben, it is not being given to Singapore.

BEN FORDHAM:

It is being leased to Singapore.

PRIME MINISTER:

It is not being leased to Singapore. It is being used by the Singaporean forces.

BEN FORDHAM:

Well it is the same result for the poor old farmers. TheyÃ¢ÂÂre booted.

PRIME MINISTER:

The big difference, this is the Australian Defence Department seeking to acquire land  for the purpose of expanding the training facilities that it uses for our Defence Forces  and which will also be used by Singapore when they visit to do training. And, of  course, the Singaporeans are putting $2.25 billion of investment into those North  Queensland centres, into Rockhampton and Townsville and these are going to be very  important.

BEN FORDHAM:

You can understand why the farmers want to do a Darryl Kerrigan from The Castle  and tell them to go and get stuffed?

PRIME MINISTER:

I absolutely can understand how they feel. I absolutely empathise with them. And that  is why it is important that the arrangements that are negotiated are as far as possible,  ones that have been reached by agreement.

BEN FORDHAM:

Couple of quick ones - why did you dissolve the Indigenous Advisory Council and  will the head of the council Warren Mundine still have a role going forward?

PRIME MINISTER:

We havenÃ¢ÂÂt dissolved it. We are appointing new members. The existing councilÃ¢ÂÂs  membership has - their term has run out and Cabinet next week will be confirming the  new members of the Advisory Council. So it is continuing. It will be refreshed as it  should be with some new members.

BEN FORDHAM:

YouÃ¢ÂÂve hinted you want to help fund the construction of clean coal-fired power  stations to deal with the closure of state power plants and hopefully reduce some  power prices. Is this going to take some significant taxpayer contributions to build  them?

PRIME MINISTER:

It may require or it may involve support from, for example, the Clean Energy Finance  Corporation. But you know, as I said in the speech yesterday, this has got to be looked  at in the context of demand for electricity. Demand for electricity is actually flat so  what we need and what weÃ¢ÂÂve lacked is a plan for how we maintain the stability and  affordability of our electricity system, especially as the older coal-fired power stations  are retired.

Now weÃ¢ÂÂve already seen Hazelwood going in Victoria, Liddell in the Hunter Valley is  expected to be retired in the 2020s. And so weÃ¢ÂÂve got to have a plan that enables us  and it will involve renewables, it will involve storage, it will involve gas, it will  involve coal, but weÃ¢ÂÂve got to have a technology agnostic and all of the above  approach that ensures that we get affordable power, we get reliable power and of  course we meet our emission reduction targets.

BEN FORDHAM:

Andrew Scipione has confirmed this afternoon that he is leaving the New South Wales  Police Force - heÃ¢ÂÂs been the Commissioner and done a great job. Have you got just a  20 second tribute to say what you like to observe about his time as New South Wales  Police Commissioner?

PRIME MINISTER:

Andrew - youÃ¢ÂÂve done a magnificent job. Thank you for your service, for your  leadership. As a citizen of New South Wales, youÃ¢ÂÂve kept me safe, as you have all of  us here. Thank you and good luck.

BEN FORDHAM:

Thank you so much for coming on the program. I wonÃ¢ÂÂt hang up on you!

PRIME MINISTER:

Okay. Thanks very much.
