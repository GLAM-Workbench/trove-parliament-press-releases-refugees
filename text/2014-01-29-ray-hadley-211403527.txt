RAY HADLEY:

Prime Minister Tony Abbott, good morning.

PRIME MINISTER:

Good morning Ray, lovely to be with you.

RAY HADLEY:

And lovely to talk to you. Did you see the 730 Report last night by chance?

PRIME MINISTER:

Look, I didnÃ¢ÂÂt. I did read the papers yesterday; I have read most of the papers today. You might remember  Ray, that as workplace relations minister I established the Cole Royal Commission into the construction  industry which led to the establishment of the Australian Building and Construction Commission; a strong  cop on the beat in that tough industry and the ABCC, we believe, produced about $6 billion a year worth of  productivity improvements in the sector by reducing lawlessness and thuggery and collusion and  intimidation and all the other things which it seems have come back with a vengeance since the former  government abolished it.

RAY HADLEY:

Well watching it on the ABC last night it was frightening. A union official blowing the whistle, death threats  against him, offered a $300,000 inducement to go quietly, really scary. Are you close to another royal  commission?

PRIME MINISTER:

Well, we promised a judicial inquiry into union slush funds, particularly the AWU slush fund which was the  subject of a lot of parliamentary debate 12 months or so back. I noticed the Sydney Morning Herald this  morning has editorialised in favour of a wider royal commission in favour of malfeasance. WeÃ¢ÂÂll be  honouring our pre-election commitments and weÃ¢ÂÂll be making announcements in due course, Ray.

RAY HADLEY:

Ok, I think the only people whoÃ¢ÂÂll be happy about all this will be the producers of an Underbelly, because in  the next decade thereÃ¢ÂÂll be four more series produced.

PRIME MINISTER:

Yeah, but look all of us should want to see industrial lawfulness. All of us should want to see people being  able to go about their life and work free of intimidation and whether weÃ¢ÂÂre talking about the streets of Kings  Cross at night, whether weÃ¢ÂÂre talking about building sites, whether weÃ¢ÂÂre talking about anywhere in our  country, remote communities, all of us should be able to go about lives, our businesses, our time with our  family.  We should be able to do this in peace and tranquillity and as far as the Federal Government is  concerned, we will bend every energy and every effort to try to bring that about.

RAY HADLEY:

But surely the Opposition and the Greens canÃ¢ÂÂt oppose the reinstatement of the Australian Building and  Construction Commission, surely.  I mean, itÃ¢ÂÂs been shown since it was dismantled by the previous Labor  government that it simply has to be there.

PRIME MINISTER:

Well Ray, IÃ¢ÂÂm afraid they are opposing it and the issue for the Labor Party and for Mr Shorten, is whose side  are they on?

RAY HADLEY:

Well the bikies and the thugs or decent and fair people  - one or the other.

PRIME MINISTER:

Exactly right. Whose side are they on? Are they on the side of law abiding citizens or are they on the side of  people with a tendency to break the law? Are they on the side of getting to the bottom of this or do they  want to support a culture of cover up? And this is a very serious question for the Leader of the Opposition  and obviously heÃ¢ÂÂll have the chance to answer it to pretty soon.

RAY HADLEY:

The ABCÃ¢ÂÂs admitted apparently their story about Navy personnel abusing boat people may not have been  true. The national broadcaster ran the asylum seeker claims that Navy personnel had forced people to put  hands on hot engine parts. It has now been revealed an ABC journalist has been trying to find Navy sources  to speak off the record because her boss feels the allegations are likely to be untrue. Now weÃ¢ÂÂre talking  about saving $20 million and IÃ¢ÂÂll get to the Defence Force in a moment; we can save a lot more than $20  million by reining this mob in. IÃ¢ÂÂm serious about this Prime Minister. ACMA attack myself and Alan Jones  almost on a monthly basis. You know, some person makes a spurious complaint against me and they fall  over themselves to investigate me. You know and they find against me that I didnÃ¢ÂÂt declare this and I didnÃ¢ÂÂt

declare that.  IÃ¢ÂÂm an honest, decent person yet these blokes and these women get away with this on a daily  basis and no one holds them accountable.

PRIME MINISTER:

Look, I can understand your frustration, Ray because at times there seems to be a double standard in large  swaths of our national life and I can understand the frustration that you feel. I want the ABC to be a straight,  news gathering and news reporting organisation and a lot of people feel at the moment that the ABC  instinctively takes everyoneÃ¢ÂÂs side but AustraliaÃ¢ÂÂs.

RAY HADLEY:

Are you one of those people?

PRIME MINISTER:

Well, I was very worried and concerned a few months back when the ABC seemed to delight in  broadcasting allegations by a traitor. This gentlemen Snowden, or this individual Snowden, who has  betrayed his country and in the process has badly, badly damaged other countries that are friends of the  United States and of course the ABC didnÃ¢ÂÂt just report what he said they took the lead in advertising what he  said…

RAY HADLEY:

They did it feverishly…

PRIME MINISTER:

That was a deep concern and I said so at the time. Look, you know if thereÃ¢ÂÂs credible evidence the ABC, like  all other news organisations, is entitled to report it, but you shouldnÃ¢ÂÂt leap to be critical of your own country  and you certainly ought to be prepared to give the Australian Navy and its hardworking personnel the  benefit of the doubt.

RAY HADLEY:

You see, you canÃ¢ÂÂt have it both ways Prime Minister in this country. If youÃ¢ÂÂve got people that are referred to  - and I donÃ¢ÂÂt object to the referral by the ABC or Fairfax - that describe the Ã¢ÂÂshock jocksÃ¢ÂÂ and IÃ¢ÂÂm one of  them, who lean a bit to the right and we get belted over the head by ACMA, a Government instrumentality,  on a regular basis and they fight against the broadcasting station. They canÃ¢ÂÂt fight against me in most cases  because they refer to the licence holder being the radio station that allows me to broadcast and pays me to  broadcast. But, then the other side of the fence, the so called Ã¢ÂÂleft leaning ABCÃ¢ÂÂ, theyÃ¢ÂÂre left to their own  devices and self-regulation. It doesnÃ¢ÂÂt work!

PRIME MINISTER:

Well again as I said, I think that there is quite an issue of double standards and I canÃ¢ÂÂt promise Ray that itÃ¢ÂÂs  going to be fixed tomorrow…

RAY HADLEY:

No…

PRIME MINISTER:

But IÃ¢ÂÂm conscious of it and as far as IÃ¢ÂÂm concerned, IÃ¢ÂÂll call it as I see it and I think it dismays Australians  when the national broadcaster appears to take everyoneÃ¢ÂÂs side but our own and I think it is a problem.

RAY HADLEY:

Well, let me be clear, IÃ¢ÂÂm not calling for the dismantling of ACMA. There must be an organisation  controlling so you donÃ¢ÂÂt have lunatics saying whatever they want to say with no basis in truth, but thereÃ¢ÂÂs  got to be some balance. You know, if theyÃ¢ÂÂre going to contain the lunatics on this side of the ledger, the  lunatics on the other side of the ledger must be answerable to someone.

PRIME MINISTER:

And this is a very fair point and you know, weÃ¢ÂÂve got all sorts of things happening which are costing more  money; there was the establishment of some fact-checking entity inside the ABC a while back and surely  that should just come naturally, to any media organisation.

RAY HADLEY:

Well, IÃ¢ÂÂve got two people outside that we check facts on a regular basis and we donÃ¢ÂÂt always get it right  because itÃ¢ÂÂs impossible doing live radio or live TV to get it right, itÃ¢ÂÂs physically impossible all the time.

PRIME MINISTER:

People are working under pressure and they call journalism you know, historyÃ¢ÂÂs first rough draft and  inevitably as we get deeper into it and we find out more, our position develops and deepens and our  understanding of what really happened increases,  but again, you would like the national broadcaster to have  a rigorous commitment to truth and at least some basic affection for our home team, so to speak.

RAY HADLEY:

We move on - the Indonesian Navy have sent three small warships to patrol their southern waters, but not to  protect them from us, but rather to finally intercept boats. It appears your policies are finally working.

PRIME MINISTER:

Well thanks for that Ray and look, IÃ¢ÂÂm pleased about this development in Indonesia because weÃ¢ÂÂve always  been prepared to work hand in glove with the Indonesians, our friends and our neighbours, to interdict the  people smuggling trade and hopefully this will make that more likely to happen. People smuggling is against  the law in Indonesia. ThereÃ¢ÂÂve been a number of successful prosecutions of people smugglers in Indonesia,  we welcome that. For most of the last few years thereÃ¢ÂÂs been a lot of cooperation between Australian and  Indonesian law enforcement authorities to try and crack down on people smuggling and letÃ¢ÂÂs hope that  resumes as quickly as possible.

RAY HADLEY:

Now, on a very positive note you announced yesterday that General Peter Cosgrove will take over as our  next Governor-General, an outstanding appointment.  Although those of us in New South Wales are feeling  a bit slighted because we thought that he would be replacing the outstanding Marie Bashir, but that wonÃ¢ÂÂt be  the case now, youÃ¢ÂÂve pinched him off New South Wales and good luck to you.  An appointment thatÃ¢ÂÂs been  applauded by everyone and so it should be.

PRIME MINISTER:

Yeah look, Peter Cosgrove is a really outstanding individual. His life has been dedicated to the service of  our country in the military and elsewhere, heÃ¢ÂÂs an Australian of the Year, he was a decorated infantry officer  in Vietnam, he was the commander of the international forces in East Timor. HeÃ¢ÂÂs a terrific bloke.  Everyone  who knows him likes him and respects him and I know heÃ¢ÂÂll do a very good job. And I love the phrase he  used, he said “the Governor-GeneralÃ¢ÂÂs job is to shine a light rather than to generate heat”, and if you look at  his book, if you read the script of his Boyer Lectures, this is someone who can say interesting and valuable  things about a whole range of difficult subjects without getting peopleÃ¢ÂÂs backs up and the job of the  Governor-General, to use Sir Zelman CowenÃ¢ÂÂs words, to help to interpret our nation to itself and I think heÃ¢ÂÂll  do that very well.

RAY HADLEY:

Okay, one thatÃ¢ÂÂs controversial and I get the feeling that people are reading the headline and not reading the  substance about this Australian Defence Force and the people serving overseas.  An allowance of 200 bucks  a day for what they call Ã¢ÂÂwar-like serviceÃ¢ÂÂ looks to be cut back for people serving in both the Persian Gulf or  at an airbase in the United Arab Emirates. Now, I refer to an article today in Fairfax, where a quote comes  from the Australian Defence Association head Neil James, said he did not anticipate too much backlash  from members of the force, because “people have been expecting this - it happens in the wind-down to any  large operational deployment. We can see the logic in the argument that the field allowance should be for  people genuinely in the field, people out in Afghani villages in quite primitive conditions”, as opposed to  those who live in, I guess, air-conditioned comfort at bases in other parts of the world.

PRIME MINISTER:

Look, I havenÃ¢ÂÂt seen that quote, but I know what heÃ¢ÂÂs driving at. Obviously the nature of service in  Afghanistan and other parts of the Middle East has changed. Until the end of last year a lot of our forces in  Afghanistan were in the field; they were engaged in regular combat and thatÃ¢ÂÂs quite different from the kind  of training and support roles that they will be in this year and subsequently. So that, as I understand it, is the  thinking behind the vision of the military brass to change these allowances.

RAY HADLEY:

So when you say the decision of the military brass, is it a decision that youÃ¢ÂÂve played a role in, or supported,  or signed off on?

PRIME MINISTER:

No, these are decisions which are made by the military and look I support their decision. I think it is a  perfectly reasonable decision and as I understand from the comments you have just read it is the sort of  decisions which is made routinely by military at the close of any particular campaign.

RAY HADLEY:

I think what, judging by talk back on this radio network this morning, that people are feeling the savings,  and they are talking about I think $20 million, they want you to cut it back from the ABC and let the soldiers  have their money. That is basically what they are saying.

PRIME MINISTER:

Well, look I can understand, Ray, why people think that soldiers always deserve the very best. I mean, our  military personnel, they take big risks on our behalf.  They are prepared to go anywhere, anytime for us and  that is fantastic but even in the very best of jobs and the noblest of vocations there have got to be rules. I

guess there are rules that say if you are serving under these conditions you get this, if you are serving under  those conditions you get that, and as I understand it this is simply the people who make these decisions in  the military deciding that the conditions have changed and therefore the allowance structure has changed.

RAY HADLEY:

Since I came back last Monday week, I have been inundated with emails and also phone calls supporting the  move by the minister responsible Kevin Andrews for a major review of welfare. Now, one of the things - I  sound like a broken record - but during the Brothers 4 Life shootings which are happening across Sydney,  and now the vast majority of those men are in custody, we had sights at one murder, a bloke turning up in a  high powered very expensive motor vehicle valued somewhere between $150,000 and $200,000  being  revealed as being on the disability support pension and it is costing us $15 billion a year. Now, we know that  about a third of the people are there for mental health issues but that leads two thirds there for other issues. I  know we have got to be careful, we canÃ¢ÂÂt be, you know, taking away from people who need our support but  by-gee Prime Minister it does look for all intents and purposes both that and Newstart are being rorted up-hill and down-dale.

PRIME MINISTER:

Yeah and I read something in one of the papers today someone who was before the courts for something  which would suggest a level of physical capacity was supposedly on the disability pension and you really  wonder about some of these things. We have got to try and ensure that people can only go onto the disability  pension if they have a genuine, long-lasting disability and if they are on the pension we need to give them  support and help. If it is possible to get them off the pension and back into the workforce we need to give  them support and help because the last thing we want to do is to see people who could be economic  contributors as well as simply social and cultural contributors not making the most of their potential and  being full and functioning members of our community. So, that Ray is what we have got to try to do and that  is what Kevin AndrewsÃ¢ÂÂ review is all about - making sure that we maximise the potential of our people.  That we do not park people particularly people whoÃ¢ÂÂve got conditions which arenÃ¢ÂÂt necessarily permanent,  arenÃ¢ÂÂt necessarily fully incapacitated, that we donÃ¢ÂÂt park people on the disability pension when they could be  doing more.

RAY HADLEY:

Well, I had a call this week on holiday Monday by a young bloke on the Central Coast who unfortunately  suffers with an illness and itÃ¢ÂÂs now under control after two years on the DSP, was moved 12 months ago to  Newstart, claims to be a nurse and claims to be fully recovered from his epilepsy under the care of a  neurologist but he is on the Central Coast and doesnÃ¢ÂÂt feel inclined to come to Sydney to find a job. Now, I  said to him, I said you are bludging on the system mate. I said if you have been on it for 12 months and up to  two years, we supported you for two years because you were trying to get your condition under control, but  it is now under control and you should be productive. YouÃ¢ÂÂre 29, get out and get a job. I wonder how many  people like that are on Newstart having come from the DSP?

PRIME MINISTER:

But at least once they move on to Newstart there are certain expectations on people in terms of going out  and looking for work. This is one of the reasons why we do have to provide people with support to get off  the disability pension and back into the workforce because in the end we donÃ¢ÂÂt do anyone any favours if we  leave them on a pension when we could have them making the most of their potential. Look, most of us Ray,  derive a large sense of our self-worth, our sense of identity from the work that we do and if you for whatever  reason are not working almost invariably the best thing we can do for you is get you back into the workforce  as quickly as possible.

RAY HADLEY:

I noted that above the cartoon from Warren in The Telegraph today there is an offering from a reader of The  Telegraph who identifies as Kate Parker-Willoughby, “I donÃ¢ÂÂt agree with work for the dole. If work is found  for these people why not paid?”  With all due respect to Kate, they are being paid by the taxpayers of this  country.

PRIME MINISTER:

Yes, and the great thing about work for the dole is that it sends a signal to the whole community that the era  of something for nothing is at an end and that you know, people are expected to be contributing members of  our community to the best of their ability and I donÃ¢ÂÂt think that is unreasonable.  I mean, if you are in trouble  we will help you.  That is what a decent and compassionate society does but we do expect people to put  something back. If you are a younger, fit person who has been on unemployment benefits for a period of  time why shouldnÃ¢ÂÂt you give something back to the community to the best of your ability for a couple of  days a week.

RAY HADLEY:

Thanks for your time Prime Minister, we know you are busy but we appreciate you talking to our audience.

PRIME MINISTER:

Thank you so much Ray.
