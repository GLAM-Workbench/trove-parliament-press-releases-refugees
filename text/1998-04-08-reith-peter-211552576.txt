TRANSCRIPT OF THE HON PETER REITH MP

PRESS CONFERENCE - PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA

Â

Â

REITH:

Â

Well good morning Ladies and   Gentlemen. Today the Government has acted decisively to fix the waterfront 
once and for all. We have launched our seven benchmark performance objectives 
which have been agreed in writing by both P&O and Patrick stevedores, 
who between them manage 95% of Australia's container terminal trade.

Â

We believe that within a very short period of time, in fact a time 
nominated by the Government, 12 to 18 months, we will see a complete 
turn around in the levels of productivity and reliability on the Australian 
waterfront, consistent with the objectives that have been agreed with 
by the two major stevedores.

Â

It will restore Australia's international reputation. It will give 
Australia a competitive stevedoring and waterfront business. It will 
give Australia a reliable business which can only promote job growth 
and economic growth generally within the Australian community. For far 
too long, Australians have had to suffer a waterfront which was been 
inefficient, which has been wracked with rorts and unreliability and 
which has failed to meet even modest international benchmark standards 
on productivity.

Â

Wharfies made redundant through this process will be entitled to significant 
redundancy amounts, up to $270,000 including superannuation. Those funds 
will be paid and made available through a wholly owned Government subsidiary, 
the Maritime Industry Financing Company. Details of that corporation 
have been provided to you. The corporation will obtain a line of credit 
of up to $250M which it will use for these purposes and these funds 
will be available to any stevedore wishing to restructure its business.

Â

The repayment of that loan by MIFCO will be met by a stevedoring industry 
levy, the details of which I've announced to the Parliament this morning, 
with the two Bills which have been introduced.

Â

Unlike WIRA, we are intent a reform program that delivers real reform 
and we are confident that the measures now taken and the commitments 
received from both companies will see this significant turnaround.

Â

The point I wish to emphasise is that the seven benchmarks will give 
Australia a competitive waterfront. It will not be at the cost to taxpayers. 
In fact, the cost will be absorbed by the stevedoring companies and 
these are very generous redundancy amounts for those who are leaving 
the industry.

Â

The final point I wish to make is that there is a challenge for the 
Labor Party now to publicly state whether or not they support the Government's 
redundancy scheme. We will require a simple yes or no, not the empty 
rhetoric that we've had from Mr Beazley in his half an hour presentation 
this morning.

Â

Do we have any questions?

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

Do you think the Senate will debate your Bill by May or into June?

Â

REITH:

Â

Well the timing of these arrangements, we have some flexibility about 
that. Obviously getting things through the Senate does take time. We've 
taken that into account. The arrangement basically will be that the 
funds are immediately available and so once any stevedore wishing to 
take up these funds has satisfied the requirements about the actual 
amounts due to people; once those formalities have been completed which 
is literally a matter of a few days, the funds will be made available 
to employees and an offer will be made to those employees in writing 
from MIFCO. And those employees will have so many days to take up the 
offer.

Â

So the first thing to say is, that the funds are immediately available. 
Employees will not have to wait. We are well advanced. The Commonwealth 
Corporation. MIFCO, the documents for registering that company I understand, 
are being lodged this morning, if they have not already been lodged.

Â

So we will be in a position to immediately 
meet those redundancy payments. The line of credit will be such that 
the repayment terms will commence after a period. a number of   months which will allow 
us time for the passage of Legislation through the Parliament in the 
usual, normal way.

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

What happens if it doesn't get through the 
Senate?

Â

REITH:

Â

Well we will obviously have to address that 
issue in due course. I think it is a challenge for the Labor Party to 
say whether or not they will publicly support the legislative packag  e. I notified Senator 
Murray last night, and gave him a short brief on the Government's proposal 
and you will have to ask him what his intentions are on this matter. 
But it would be strange indeed if the Labor Party is publicly opposed 
to these wharfies obtaining their rightful entitlements for redundancy 
payouts.

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

Mr Reith, how does this sit with the no worker will be worse off policy? 
The Government is providing a quarter of a billion dollars so that more 
than one thousand Australians can be sacked?

Â

REITH:

Â

Well the promises that we made before the last election were that, 
if you entered into an agreement, then the terms and conditions of that 
agreement must be such that you are not disadvantaged against the Award. 
That is the commitment that we gave and furthermore, we legislated that 
commitment. I mean we actually put that commitment into the Workplace 
Relations Act. It's called the No Disadvantage Test. We met that promise 
100%. Now, in terms of jobs, the fact is that many thousands of Australians 
have lost their jobs or failed to obtain work because of the inefficiency 
of the Australian waterfront. I mean Australia is infamous for its lack 
of reliability on the waterfront. This is a well known impediment to 
better economic circumstances in Australia. We have a well deserved, 
sadly, a well deserved international reputation for a shockingly unreliable 
and unproductive waterfront.

Â

I mean if you look at the crane rates for Australia compared to international 
competitors, New Zealand, perhaps the closest, nearest best example. 
Crane rates in New Zealand are 24, 25, 26 and above. What are they in 
Australia? Eighteen in Melbourne. The national five port average is 
18. And no one has fairly disputed or repudiated that claim. Crane rates, 
productivity, reliability factors, OH&S factors, are all well below 
what they ought to be. And the people who have been paying for this, 
have been ordinary consumers and literally thousands of Australian businesses 
who have either lost work because of the lack of competitive position 
on the Australian waterfront or never been even able to work custom 
overseas or otherwise because of the lack of reliability for the Australian 
waterfront.

Â

So it's a fair question but it needs to be put in context of what 
for Australia has been a long running failure to address and to really 
significantly reform this industry.

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

Mr Reith, after to this announcement today, how can you argue that 
there hasn't been collusion between the Government, Patricks and the 
NFF right back to Dubai?

Â

REITH:

Â

I mean John Coombs has run conspiracy arguments sort of all the way 
through this. I mean our position in terms of redundancies, has been 
quite clear. In fact I made a statement. I told John Coombs this in 
December and made a statement about it. And I've repeated that statement 
in January, February and March this year. And we have been saying publicly, 
we have been saying publicly, look if the MUA continues to run a campaign 
against it's own employer, in the end the jobs of the people who work 
at Patricks is going to be jeopardised.

Â

Now you can take my doorstops for the last three weeks. There's hardly 
a day gone by when we haven't said publicly that if the MUA sets out 
to destroy the employer, then the people who will suffer that will in 
fact be the very people who depend on Patricks for their work.

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

Do you have knowledge of all of this coming?

Â

REITH:

Â

Well what we've always had knowledge of is that there are a range 
of options for any employer, not just Patricks but for P&O and other 
stevedores, to use in managing these issues. That's all on the public 
record. Now we've never denied the fact that our policy has been to 
encourage significant reform on the waterfront. We went into the last 
election. We've been talking about the need for significant reform on 
the Australian waterfront for as long as I can remember. In fact, I 
put a paper out on this myself, ten years ago, saying what needed to 
be done and why it was important that it be done.

Â

Even after the WIRA process was announced in 
'89, we publicly attacked Labor's proposal, as did a whole number of 
other independent commentators saying that this was not enough, that 
further reform was necessary and that Labor's WIRA process would fail. 
I   mean, 
we're on the public record predicting the failure of WIRA in 1989 and 
so our position on this has always crystal clear, entirely up front 
and entirely transparent and is consistent with a long standing, policy 
position of the Coalition

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

Mr Reith, should the MUA have accepted the 
offer that Patrick was making to its workers in these enterprise agreements 
which would have resulted in them have lower wages?

Â

REITH:

Â

Well, I think the better answer to that is 
to say that the MUA leadership s  hould have all along, focussed on the real problem. You see, as I've 
said to John Coombs again directly to his face, it's all very well running 
a political ideological campaign against the employer, against the Government, 
or against anybody else you don't like. But in the end it was never 
sustainable for Australia to have such an unproductive, unreliable waterfront. 
Now he has never accepted that proposition.

Â

I mean. genuinely I can say to you, we had a whole series of meetings 
with the unions at the end of 1996, which haven't been, you know, sort 
of widely reported. But I mean we went to a lot of trouble. We gave 
them a paper, we went through what we believed to be the problem, what 
sort of things might be done to fix the problems and we genuinely tried 
to see if there was some common ground to find a solution to the problems. 
And after those three meetings, and I would be happy to provide you 
with the documents, we provided them and their response, I've got them 
still.

Â

They never were prepared to accept the need. You're accepting my offer. 
I've given them out before. They were never prepared to address the 
fundamental issues. When I was given responsibility for the maritime 
issues I said, one of the first things I said publicly was, we are prepared 
to sit down and talk with the union about dealing with the productivity 
problems on the Australian waterfront. And we sat down genuinely with 
them, and went through these issues. And on every one of them, even 
down to occupational health and safety, when we produced the Easson 
Report, which shows what a shocking record we have, even though the 
companies have, give them credit for what they have attempted to do 
improving safety, the fact is, safety levels on the Australian waterfront 
are worse than what they are in the Coal industry. And to each and everyone 
of those propositions, we have the standard answer like don't compare 
us to Singapore, which we have never done, don't do this because the 
capital equipment's not good enough. I mean there has always been the 
same old predictable excuses as to why it is not a problem and why it 
doesn't need to be addressed.

Â

We could not have done more in terms of sitting down talking with 
this union about what needs to be done. And in the end what was their 
real response? Their real response was to run a campaign against their 
own employer, even though the employer was saying publicly to them, 
we cannot financially withstand your industrial action because ultimately, 
we don't have an unlimited supply of funds to keep this company going.

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

But Mr Reith, what Patrick has been proposing was lower wages. Is 
that a legitimate condition to put to the MUA?

Â

REITH:

Â

I must say I don't think that properly captures what they've been 
asking for. What properly captures what they've been asking for is what 
Mr Corrigan has said this morning and repeatedly. And that is, they 
would like people to do a decent days work for a decent days pay.

Â

That is the fact of it. You see, you talk to me about wage levels, 
if you look at the practices on the Australian waterfront, there are 
many circumstances where people are paid but they are not actually working, 
where they have gone home, and they've never been prepared to accept 
a change in practices. Forget about the wage levels, its not just a 
question about the wage levels. They've never accepted a proposition 
that people would be required to meet ordinary community standards in 
terms of work effort and secondly, they have never accepted the proposition 
that the level of industrial action on the Australian waterfront is 
simply unacceptable.

Â

And so, I don't think you can say, if they 
just accepted, you know, the last offer things would have been, or if 
the matter had been concluded by an agreement to a wage level it would 
have been fixed. I don't think the negotiations have ever been as limit  ed as that. The negotiations 
as I understand them, and I really only understand them from what's 
been said on the public record, have covered the whole gamete of problems, 
problems which the MUA have simply not been prepared to tackle.

Â

Katherine, Katherine.

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

Mr Reith, if you are engaged in enterprise bargaining, you consistently 
said that that's up to the parties to decide. But here you are bringing 
in a levy which consumers will ultimately pay for, when you criticise 
the use of tax payers money before. I mean aren't you being hypocritical 
in defining the principles of your own Workplace Relations Act?

Â

REITH:

Â

No, I don't think so. The consumers are not paying for this. This 
will be absorbed by the stevedores and they have given us an undertaking 
to that effect and so I think that is a fairly complete response to 
your point.

Â

But there's no doubt that there's a Government interest in this issues, 
and again we've said that repeatedly. We have a public interest in a 
much more efficient waterfront system and we've said it before the election 
and we've continued to say it and we have acted in accordance with that 
statement.

Â

Sorry, Katherine, Katherine.

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

Mr Reith, is it possible that the company may have breached the law 
in fact through these redundancies because doesn't the stevedoring award 
have in it a clause requiring the company to consult before any large 
scale redundancies?

Â

REITH:

Â

Well these claims are going to be made by the union

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

Legitimate claims?

Â

REITH:

Â

Well   the legitimacy of any claims that the union makes will have to be 
tested in the appropriate place.

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

(inaudible)

Â

REITH:

Â

Well from my perspective the fact of the matter is that the MUA has 
been running a campaign against its own employer and...

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

It has caused disagreements?

Â

REITH:

Â

Well, we will see what the courts say or don't say.

Â

As I understand the position is that what the company has done is 
that it has terminated contracts it has with the labour hire companies 
which in turn employ the MUA employees. That's what they announced last 
night - that they were terminating the labour hire contracts and replacing 
those contracts with new contracts, including the P&CS operation 
and eight other contractors. Now that in itself does not tell you about 
the relationship between the labour hire company and the employees.

Â

Now I know that is a technical answer but I believe that to be actually 
the case and what they have actually announced. And so all these questions 
about you know the conduct of the employer is a question about the factual 
situation between the labour hire companies and the existing workforce.

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

Has the Government...

Â

REITH:

Â

And that's a, ultimately that is a matter for Patrick to answer.

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

Has the Government taken advice on that point though?

Â

REITH:

Â

No, we've not. That's a, that really relies upon the facts of the 
circumstances for which you would have to ask Patricks.

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

Do you find any paradox in policy between the 
Government providing   a line of credit running into hundreds of millions of dollars for 
a company to sack workers, while workers such as those at Cobar, haven't 
been able to persuade the Government to assist them in any way financially?

Â

REITH:

Â

I think there are very clear differences. The waterfront industry 
has long been a subject of Government involvement in one shape, form 
or another. It was certainly recognised as a unique industry by the 
Labor Party at the commencement of the WIRA process, and given that 
the WIRA process didn't fix the problems. We have faced the same industry, 
with the same problems and the same unique features and that is therefore 
very different to the circumstances of any individual operation like 
it has such as a mine or an abattoir or else.

Â

So the first thing I would say is, that this industry is unique and 
it is at an industry level as opposed to an enterprise level. Also a 
significant difference is that these particular enterprises that you 
refer to, they have closed due to different circumstances, but basically 
commercial or market circumstances surrounding that particular enterprise. 
That is not what has happened on this particular occasion. This particular 
occasion is a restructuring process for the industry as a whole and 
that restructuring process will lead to the achievement of international, 
internationally competitive benchmarks set by the Government.

Â

So one is an individual circumstance, the other 
is an industry wide approach to restructuring. And the other big difference 
is, that with those particular enterprises, they don't have a stream 
of income. They are for one reason or another no longer operat  ional. That is not the 
case on the Australian waterfront. The Australian waterfront stevedoring 
businesses are viable businesses. And they can support through the income 
stream of those viable businesses, a capacity to repay the funds which 
have been borrowed, or which will be borrowed through MFICO and thus 
repaid by the industry.

Â

So I do think generally, they are very significant differences and 
they've always been treated as different. I mean this is not, you know 
this is not something we have called upon for our own purposes. I mean, 
this was the attitude of previous Governments. And given the industry 
wide monopoly control still existing by the MUA, the situation we faced 
in that sense is the same as same as faced by our predecessors.

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

Mr Reith, you mentioned on radio I believe this morning, that the 
Government had a legal team in London for any movement by the ITF. Does 
that mean that the Government believes that they get a finding against 
the ITF which could be upheld by British Court?

Â

REITH:

Â

We believe that there is action available to the Government to take 
or alternatively or complementary fashion, legal action that others 
could take in London against the ITF. And I don't intend to specify 
what legal action the Commonwealth may or may note take but we have 
certainly made the advice that we have had available to us, available 
to interested parties.

Â

I've been speaking to shipping companies for example this morning 
and I've been putting them on to the general counsel that I've had advising 
me through this matter.

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

Does that advice go to the question of whether or not the Trade Practices 
Act has extra territorial effect?

Â

REITH:

Â

Well it may well do.

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

Mr Reith, P&O this morning said that they also are considering 
redundancies of their workforce. Does that perhaps, instead of going 
down the path or reform, heighten the possibility of just major confrontation?

Â

REITH:

Â

Well as I understand it, the first thing to say is that P&O ports 
company is operating this morning. They are servicing, loading and unloading 
ships this morning. In terms of their approach, we have had discussions 
with them about the Government's policy on redundancies. They have agreed 
to the legislative approach that we have announced this morning and 
the general framework for the industry.

Â

It is true that P&O have taken a different approach to managing 
this issue but then again, they've not been the subject of a campaign 
by the MUA to run them out of business. But it's also true as Mr Hein 
said at the start of this dispute, that if P&O find themselves up 
against a much more effective, efficient competitor, then they themselves 
will have to look at changing their operations to match the competition.

Â

Now P&O have signed up to the seven benchmark objectives that 
we've put to them. They've signed up to the time lines for the achievement 
of those objectives. And so clearly they are going to need to have some 
serious discussions with the union about how they are going to be able 
to restructure their business to match the competition.

Â

This is an industry wide package. We have consulted with the two majors. 
We will obviously also consult with some of the smaller players in stevedoring 
in Australia but this is a scheme to any stevedore.

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

Does it   attract superannuation and how much is the highest redundancy pay 
out?

Â

REITH:

Â

Tony, the Patrick's press release, which they issued last night, claimed 
an average redundancy figure of $84,000. I've not been in a position 
to otherwise verify that figure. I presume it's right.

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

You put that into the word superannuation?

Â

REITH:

Â

Well we've put out in the pack. We put out in the pack some representative 
examples which we've been given. Now those figures will obviously in 
the end, have to be checked off by the MIFCO organisation and there 
will have to be certification as to the amounts due to these people 
before an offer can be made. So I'm being cautious about the actual 
numbers but they are I believe genuine numbers and can give you a fair 
indication of the generosity of the payments. I mean you can understand 
the wharfies have made sure they get a very generous redundancy package 
in place.

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

Is there any difference between the redundancy 
package and the seven point benchmark scheme? Do you have to go for 
one to get the other?

Â

REITH:

Â

Well no, I mean the approach we've taken an 
approach to this in the sense that the Government ha  s been prepared to take a role in respect of ensuring the people are 
paid out their entitlements. But at the same time, we also have expectations 
of the companies that they'll meet the benchmarks that we've set. And 
they've signed off on both, on both parts if you like. Well that's clear 
in the documentation.

Â

I'm sorry, there was one other thing I was going to say. I mean we 
will obviously be monitoring the productivity levels and performance 
on the waterfront very closely indeed. Now I believe what' s happened, 
will see these reforms in place and the objectives reached but we will 
have the ACCC looking at these issues on a regular basis. We've got 
the BTCE (the Bureau of Transport and Communication Economics) waterline 
series which will monitor this. We will have a regular publication of 
various data which is all set out in the documentation so that there's 
a transparent monitoring of progress to achieve these objectives.

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

And what happens if they don't meet the objectives?

Â

REITH:

Â

Well I believe they will. l mean I genuinely do because what we are 
seeing now is a grappling with the really central issues and that's 
clear. I mean for example, one of the things that's happened is that 
the Patricks organisation is contracting out to a number of different 
companies. And they will be able to monitor the performance of those 
companies which quite frankly happens in virtually every other industry 
in Australia but has never been allowed to happen on the Australian 
waterfront.

Â

I mean that dispute we had last year at the P&O facility about 
the diesel engines. The company had sold second hand diesel engines 
cause it wanted new ones and the MUA refused to allow the diesel engines 
to leave the site because they had the job to maintain them, even though 
they were less reliable than new ones. And even though it was more closely 
to keep the old ones, the MUA was protecting it's job. Now what will 
happen, as it happens in most other places, they will obviously contract 
out maintenance and in the contract arrangements, they'll make sure 
that the performance that they set for the contract is met.

Â

Now that is ordinary commercial practice - everywhere else except 
the waterfront and that is why we are very confident about meeting these 
objectives. I mean this, it's a complicated business stevedoring in 
one sense and there's a lot of high tech you know potentially to be, 
well quite a lot of high tech actually already spent in managing these 
enterprises. But it's not all that complicated. Carmel Egan, the journalist 
in Melbourne, was able to demonstrate that in ten days she could get 
a ticket. And I reckon after a month or a couple of months, you know 
these trainees will show you that Australia can do a hell of a lot better 
then what we've been doing up until now.

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

Mr Reith, just in terms of the politics of this dispute. You've got 
boats arriving full of security guards under the quite darkness and 
security guards snapping at people's heals. Do you think that some voters 
will perhaps be sympathetic to the policy side of the argument might 
be turned off by the tactics that Patricks...

Â

REITH:

Â

I must say from what I've been informed of 
the sort of matters overnight, by and large this thing has gone relatively 
smoothly. Now there are some MUA members held up in t  he canteen apparently at East Swanson Dock. And there's a report unconfirmed 
that the MUA is going down there to tell them to come out of the canteen. 
But you know, all things considered and given that the waterfront has 
had a record of violence going back many years, you know so far I think 
events have been relatively controlled and moderated.

Â

Well it is early days yet, early days, but I suppose in one sense, 
but there's no doubt that last night's developments were a turning point 
in the history of reform of the Australian waterfront. It means for 
Australia, we're going to have a decent, efficient, reliable waterfront 
and it's something that many people have wanted for many, many years.

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

You've obviously been tick tacking with the 
company for a fair while for this. When was the decision taken to go 
with the (inaudible) route and...

Â

REITH:

Â

Well in the end these decisions are all a decision 
for Patricks. I mean the fact is th  at Patricks is the company responsible. Patricks. Well I mean these 
things have been in the public arena. So I mean, it's not in that sense, 
I don't think anybody was surprised that in the end they were pushed 
too far and made a decision. Now what actually happened? Well they rang 
my office last night and said this is what we've done and we're sending 
you a copy of the press release. That's what actually happened. You 
know, that was the last moment.

Â

In terms of discussions...

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

Did you have the legislation drafted?

Â

REITH:

Â

Oh sure. And in terms of discussions?

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

When was it obvious...

Â

REITH:

Â

So obvious, that it's apparent to all and it is true that we have 
been pursuing the implementation of a general policy position which 
I announced before Christmas. But that is not new. I mean it is on the 
public record. I have said it. We have boxed the speeches which said, 
you know my Department is having discussions about the implementation 
of this policy. So it's on the public record and what we have been doing 
is putting in place the means to implement that which we have already 
publicly declared.

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

When was the actual decision taken? We know today that......

Â

REITH:

Â

Well you've got to ask........

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

You've taken that action to get an injunction to prevent this happening? 
The speculation has been that the move would come on the weekend. Why 
did it come last night?

Â

REITH:

Â

Honestly, you will have to ask Patricks about the decisions, the final 
decisions that they've taken. I mean you can go back through this dispute 
and say well you know when did this happen and when did that happen? 
The fact of the matter is that Patricks, we've had discussions with 
Patricks, we've had discussions with P&O, we've had discussions 
with shipping companies about putting in place the redundancy package.

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

But when was the decision made?

Â

REITH:

Â

The decision, they advised us last night they 
had made a decision and they sent us a statement as to what they were 
going to say.

Â

JOURNA  LIST:

Â

What time was that?

Â

REITH:

Â

That was at about 11 o'clock.

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

Your statement was timed at 11 o'clock.

Â

REITH:

Â

Yes I know I put it out at 11 o'clock.

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

A pretty slick operation?

Â

REITH:

Â

Malcolm, there's no secret that this thing was building up. None whatsoever. 
I mean we were getting phone calls last night into my office, not from 
Patricks but from three or four other people, saying oh we think something's 
happening tonight.

Â

You know I would be happy to privately tell you who they were just 
to convince you about that. So there was obviously things happening 
but as to when they finally actually made the decision, that ultimately 
is a matter for them.

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

When did you tell them that they would have the support in terms of 
redundancy?

Â

REITH:

Â

Well the discussions on the Government's policy have certainly intensified 
in the last two or three weeks on the redundancy stuff. We've had discussions 
with P&O and with Patricks and with shipping companies, about the 
policy that we had announced before Christmas and how we.....

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

Did anything happen yesterday in Cabinet?

Â

REITH:

Â

On that point?

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

On this issue?

Â

REITH:

Â

Well I don't discuss Cabinet.

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

Can I check with you on this MFICO? Will th  e full costs of MIFCO 
be funded through the levy including it's administrative costs and it's 
interest rate bill?

Â

REITH:

Â

Yes the whole, every last cent will be paid for by the industry. Not 
one cent will be paid by the taxpayer. There will be an appropriation 
and the sort of accounting technicalities of it all but the bottom line 
is that the taxpayer is not paying for this. It is being paid for by 
the stevedores and they will absorb the costs.

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

Mr Reith, can you say that the stevedores won't pass the cost of the 
levy...

Â

REITH:

Â

I've got it in writing from them.

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

... onto their clients, the shipping companies 
who deal directly with importers and exporters, are you saying that 
they won't pass it onto their customers?

Â

REITH:

Â

I've got it in writing.

Â

JOURNALIS  T:

Â

When can we have a look at it then?

Â

REITH:

Â

It's in the pack. I mean you ought to read it. Why would this surprise 
you? You shouldn't be surprised. I mean if these companies can run their 
businesses a lot more efficiently, then that is a downward pressure 
on prices not an upward pressure. I mean the example I had yesterday 
in the house was a classic example. At Webb Dock, the maintenance costs 
was what $3M a year and that's because the MUA was running the maintenance, 
$3M a year. Call it $2M whatever the figure was. What is the cost for 
the farmers? They've contracted it out and the cost is $400,000 a year. 
Now quite frankly that is just one aspect of it. I mean this whole show, 
this whole stevedoring industry has been grossly overmanned. I mean 
I am told the numbers we're talking about for the Patrick's organisation 
is something like 1,400 redundancies and 400 or thereabouts replacements 
through contracting arrangements.

Â

Now that is nearly a one in three and the reason 
for that is the thing is grossly   overmanned.

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

How long will it take for cost savings to flow through to Australian 
households?

Â

REITH:

Â

Well the first point to make is that the costs of the levy are being 
absorbed. I think what you'll see is over time, pressure for those costs 
to come down. We've not nominated a figure but we have I think, every 
real chance and confidence that, with the restructure going on the industry 
and the capacity for new entrants in the future, that you generally 
have now a much more competitive system. And therefore, those cost reductions 
and efficiencies will be available to the Australian consumer.

Â

And it's not just a straight sort of easy to count dollars and cents 
issue because a lot of these costs are sort of hidden away in lack of 
reliability. I mean there are shipping companies for example, that when 
they know there's a ship going to Australia, they add another day onto 
the costs because the Australian waterfront has a record of industrial 
action nine times the national average. And your chances are, if you 
send a ship to Australia, you'll cop some industrial action.

Â

As Richard Hein I think it was who said in a famous quote last year, 
"you can barely go by, barely a day can go by on the Australian 
waterfront where there isn't industrial action somewhere". Now 
that is a cost already being paid for by the consumer but which, over 
time is going to be taken out of the system and that's a benefit to 
everybody.

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

So will consumers know the difference in twelve months?

Â

REITH:

Â

Well I think what we'll see in the 6 to 12 to 18 month period, is 
we will see these big changes going on in the way in which these businesses 
operate. Obviously it' s not an overnight transformation but I personally 
think that it's going to be quicker than people expect but we've got 
a 12 to 18 month schedule in there as a definite certain benchmark, 
against which the policy objectives can be tested.

Â

I'll take a couple more if I may.

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

Mr Reith, comments that you said about overstaffing on the waterfront 
and in the stevedoring industry. What concerns do you have if any, about 
safety on the waterfront in the short term, given there will be some 
imperative to get partly trained people working?

Â

REITH:

Â

I don't I wouldn't accept the proposition that sort of partly trained 
people are going to be used. I believe that they will only employ people 
who are fully trained and who are certificated in accordance with the 
rules and regulations that relate to training. Safety is definitely 
an issue but the Easson Report made it quite clear that the safety record 
on the Australian waterfront is you know, very poor indeed. And that's 
way we've got that as one of our benchmarks. I believe they can do a 
lot better and with better workplace relations, I think you have the 
means to achieve it.

Â

The union is running this campaign all the 
time you know that the equipment's no good, the people are no good, 
the training's no good, the whole show's no good and therefore, you 
know you shouldn't have a bar of it. But in the end, the Patrick's organisat  ion has the management 
experience to manage these issues and I know safety is a very high priority. 
I mean I know, I've spoken recently to Richard Hein about this. Safety 
is a very high priority for that company and I think it was very instructive 
to me that in our discussions with the unions. In the end, they weren't 
even prepared to sign off on a national benchmark for safety even though 
that was solely about the most important thing for their membership 
safety. They wouldn't even sign up on that which just shows you what 
there real attitude's been.

Â

Perhaps two more.

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

Has Patricks given any indication that....

Â

REITH:

Â

Sorry, Ladies first.

Â

Katherine sorry (laughter).

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

I'm just a little confused how the money can 
be immediately b  e available for redundancies without legislation to create this corporation 
and without an appropriation?

Â

REITH:

Â

Well it can be and I'm sure that my legal advisers and finance people 
and AG's people will give you the technical answer that you want. But 
relying on the good advice from my excellent Secretary, Dr Shergold, 
that company is a wholly owned Commonwealth subsidiary. The paperwork 
has all been done in conjunction with AG's and DOFA and it's all been 
done and it's all going happen.

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

What happens to it if the Senate rejects the Bill?

Â

REITH:

Â

Well that is a question for the Senate and that's a challenge for 
Mr Beazley. You should go down and ask Mr Beazley. He seems to have 
abandoned his policy. He had for 30 minutes this morning to tell us 
what his policy was. The only policy we've had from Kim Beazley so far 
is that Bob Hawke should be invited to come back and fix the waterfront. 
He seems to have abandoned that policy and yet half an hour. We gave 
him leave to speak on the matter which is a bit exceptional but I was 
quite happy to give him leave because I wanted to hear what his policy 
was, and the one issue which was sort of there for him to confront was 
what his attitude would be on the Bill and he didn't actually say.

Â

So I think you should go and ask Mr Beazley but in due course, you 
would also need to ask the Democrats and the Independents whether or 
not they think that those made redundant, should be able to receive 
the redundancy, the generous redundancy payments that are being made 
available.

Â

One last question.

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

Has Patricks given any indication that the new companies will be relying 
extensively on by the overseas or ex-military personnel?

Â

REITH:

Â

Look the information I have on that is I don't think anymore than 
what's on the public record. I understand that there are some hundreds, 
I don't know, two hundred or three hundred, something of that order, 
people who are available from P&CS. I'm not quite sure what the 
deal will be or has been done with Patricks about the supply of that 
labour. I also understand though that quite a lot of labour will be 
from other companies. Now I don't know who those other companies are. 
You'll really have to ask them.

Â

So as to the people who went to Dubai. The public reports have been 
50 or 60, but I honestly just don't know other than what has been in 
the press.

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

Given the reaction...

Â

REITH:

Â

One last, definitely the last one Michael.

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

Given the reaction by the Democrats and the tone of Mr Beazley' s 
speech today, would you expect this legislation to be, to end up being 
a double dissolution trigger?

Â

REITH:

Â

No, I don't think so. We've introduced it into 
the house today. It will go off to the Senate in due course and given 
the other double dissolution matters aro  und, I wouldn't have thought that it would...

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

...the same time frame as Telstra?

Â

REITH:

Â

Well without any reference to Telstra, you know, defined a gap of 
three months after first rejection, is a long way off. I would have 
thought quite frankly. But I don't think, I don't think in the end that 
the Labor Party aren't going to have any choice, they are going to have 
vote for it, but you should ask Mr Beazley.

Â

Thank you.
