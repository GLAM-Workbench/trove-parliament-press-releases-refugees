A study of New South Wales court records between 1985 and  1987 has found that Vietnamese youths have a substantially  lower rate of conviction than non-Vietnamese youths.

The Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic  Affairs, Senator Robert Ray, said the study showed that  Vietnamese between the ages of 18 and 24 years registered  less than half as many convictions as non-Vietnamese.

The rate for Vietnamese minors (10 to 17 years) was almost  half the non-Vietnamese rate over the three years.

The study, entitled 'Vietnamese Refugees: Crime rates of  minors and youths in New South Wales', was commissioned by  the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic  Affairs.

"On the basis of this study, you would have to conclude that  Vietnamese youths are less likely to be criminally involved  than non-Vietnamese," Senator Ray said.

"That's a very important finding because it will help kill  off a myth about Vietnamese criminal involvement which has  currency in some sections of the wider community.

"Many people in the Vietamese community, including the  youth, suffer from the memory of trauma, dislocation, and  disorientation.

"They don't automatically shed those memories when they come  to Australia, and they don't need the extra burden put on  them by people who perpetuate negative myths about them,"  the Minister said.

The report, By Dr Patricia Weiser Easteal, was prepared  under the direction of the Australian Institute of  Criminology. It is available through the Institute and  Government bookshops.
