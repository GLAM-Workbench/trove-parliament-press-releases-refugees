E&OE ONLY

MICHAEL ROWLAND:       Now the Federal Government has been accused of  holding back Victoria's emergency services. 20MHz of broadband spectrum had  been requested for police, fire and ambulance communications in the event of a  major natural disaster.

KARINA  CARVALHO:        But  yesterday  Attorney-General  Nicola  Roxon   announced  just  10MHz  would  be  provided.  Nicola  Roxon  joins  us  now  from   Canberra. Thanks so much for your time.

NICOLA ROXON:    It's a pleasure.

KARINA  CARVALHO:        Victorian  Emergency  Services  [sic]  say  they  need   double the broadcast spectrum that the Federal Government is providing them,  why don't you give them more? Surely there's no higher priority?

NICOLA ROXON:    Well I think that this is just completely the wrong approach  from the Victorian Government. What the Commonwealth has done is provided,  as requested, a dedicated piece of the spectrum, or a dedicated channel if you  like, of communication so that emergency service personnel across the country  can use it.

The experts that allocate that spectrum have made the assessment that 10MHz  is  enough.  It's  a  very  valuable  commercial  commodity,  so  obviously  you  don't   allocate  more  than  is  needed.  And  I  think this  is  really  just  a  bit  of  political   posturing from Mr Baillieu, who hasn't put any financial commitment on the table  to  make  sure  that  this  dedicated  spectrum  becomes  a  reality  to  improve   communications between emergency services personnel.

KARINA CARVALHO:        Well he says that the Government just wants to sell  the rest of it at a windfall to make a profit?

NICOLA  ROXON:    Well  there's  no  - there's  no  question  of  windfall.  This  is  a   valuable  commercial  piece  of  space  - communication  space  that  otherwise  is   sold  to  the  highest  bidder.  We  have,  as  requested  - because  we  believe  that   having a dedicated channel for emergency services personnel is also vital - set  aside  10MHZ,  which  all  the  experts  tell  us  is  sufficient  for  this  communication   purpose.

We've offered it at a public interest price, we've started - we've written to all of  the premiers and emergency service ministers to say that the Commonwealth is  prepared to offer that at 50 per cent of the price. So that's worth over - more than  $100 million, and to date Mr Baillieu doesn't have a single dollar on the table and  in fact is slashing money from fire fighting services in his most recent budget. So  I think this is a little bit of a political distraction by him hoping that people won't  notice that he's actually taking money out of fire fighting budgets.

KARINA  CARVALHO:        The  Victorian  Police  Association  [sic]  says  that   20MHz is the bare minimum that Victoria will need.

NICOLA ROXON:    Well that's not what the experts have told us. ACMA is the  body  that's  responsible  for  the  oversight  and  sale  of  spectrum.  They've  taken   advice  from  the  experts,  they've  worked  across  the  community.  This  isn't  a   decision that the Government just made by picking a figure - pulling a figure out

of a hat.

That 10MHz has been set aside, we're  offering that to states and  territories for  their emergency services personnel. We hope that they now will want to take that  up and work with us to ensure that it can improve communications when we face  serious disasters in the future. But it will be a matter for the states and territories  whether they are prepared to work with us, to negotiate over this very important  reform. And to date we've not seen a dollar on the table from Mr Baillieu.

KARINA  CARVALHO:        How much  will  be  - will  you  be  looking  to  sell  that   other 10MHz for?

NICOLA ROXON:    I beg your pardon? I couldn't hear that question.

KARINA  CARVALHO:        How  much  will  be  - will  you  be  looking  to  sell  the   other 10MHz for?

NICOLA ROXON:    Well look, the 10MHz, there's a commercial price. Normally  this piece of the spectrum is sold on the market to the highest bidder. We accept  and agree that a certain amount of spectrum that's needed should be set aside  so that our police and our fire fighters can safely communicate with each other in

time  of  crisis.  And  we  don't  think  that  that  should  be  made  available  at  a   commercial  price.  We're  offering  it  to  the  states  and  territories  for  their   emergency services personnel at a very reduced price.

Of course we're happy to talk with them about the terms and conditions of that,  and  that's  what  we've  kicked  off  in  discussions  and  instead  we've  seen  Mr   Baillieu come out swinging saying it's not enough. This is the first time that such  a dedicated channel's been made available in our history, and I would've thought  the premiers would be welcoming it.

KARINA  CARVALHO:        Nicola  Roxon  let's  move  onto  another  subject.  And   the Human Rights Commission, their report is due out today and it says that 29  per cent of women - there's been a big jump in the number of women who are

experiencing a backlash at work after complaining about sexual harassment.

NICOLA  ROXON:    This  is  a  worrying  report  from  the  Human  Rights   Commission. It shows that sexual harassment is still unfortunately alive and well  in many workplaces. And you know, we can hope that it might mean that people  are  better  at  reporting  these  instances.  But  I  suspect  it  means  as  the  Sex   Discrimination Commissioner says, that really we haven't kept making progress  in this area and that we need people to focus on what's a safe workplace, that  people should be free from harassment.

And obviously that's something that Labor governments for many, many decades  have been committed to. Introducing the laws and now hoping that working with  the  Human  Rights  Commission,  unions,  employers  and  others,  we  can  see   change over time in our workplaces.

KARINA CARVALHO:        Nicola Roxon I also wanted to ask you about a story  that's on the front page of The West Australian this morning and that says that  Labor's getting ready to excise the entire Australian mainland from the migration  zone. Is that correct, do you support it, and do you think it's a step too far?

NICOLA ROXON:    Well I'm not going to comment on some speculative stories,  particularly in an area that's not my portfolio. But I would raise with you of course  that we had an expert report which was chaired by Angus Houston. It did make  some recommendations about how we treat irregular arrivals so that we reduce  the risks of - that people are taking coming here by sea.

That did make recommendations about how we should treat those who actually  reached  the  mainland,  and  the  Government  and  particularly  the  Minister  for   Immigration  is  working  through  those  options.  So  it wouldn't  be  a  surprise  to   anyone that we are trying to look at all ways to send a very strong message that  people  should  not  risk  their  lives  and  their  children's  lives  by  getting  on   dangerous boats that sometimes don't even make it to their intended destination.

KARINA  CARVALHO:        So  is this being discussed  in  the  Labor Party room  and does Caucus support it?

NICOLA  ROXON:    Well  we  don't  discuss  in  the  media  what's  in  Caucus  and   Cabinet. What is public of course is that those recommendations were made by  Angus Houston, we're working through the way the Government will implement  each and every one of those recommendations. And I think I'll leave that for the  Minister  for  Immigration  to  make  any  announcements  if  and  when  that  time  is   appropriate.

KARINA CARVALHO:        Nicola Roxon, thanks for your time this morning.

NICOLA ROXON:    It's a pleasure.



Ends.
