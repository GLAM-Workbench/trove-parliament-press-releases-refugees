Australian Council of Churches Proposals for  -  Refugee Resettlement - Ã¢ÂÂ

The Australian Council of Churches has made an important

offer of assistance in the resettlement of Indo-Chinese

refugees, the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, the

Hon. M.J.R. MacKellar, said today.

Mr MacKellar was commenting after speaking with a

delegation of representatives of the Australian Council of

Churches. They w e r e :

Dr C.A. Price  The Very Rev. J. Reid  Rev. Dr J. Brown  Rev. M. Chittleborough

The delegation pressed for a significant increase in

Australia's refugee resettlement programme while commending the

Government for its recent action in pressing Vietnam to desist

from persecuting a substantial minority of its population.

Mr MacKellar welcomed an offer by the delegation to

increase substantially church involvement in a refugee hosting

programme under which Australian families befriend refugees

in hostels and assist them in their adjustment to life in the

Australian community.

Proposals made by the delegation for church involvement

in a wider range of resettlement activities would be looked at

very carefully as a possible important addition to Australia's

capacity to resettle Indo-Chinese refugees. These proposals would Ã¢ÂÂ  >

be among a number of initiatives considered by the Government

in the next few days in the course of a general review of the

policies concerning the Indo-Chinese refugee situation,

Mr MacKellar said.
