OPPOSITION WELCOMES BELATED NEW

MEASURES TO COMBAT PEOPLE SMUGGLERS

Â

Â

The F ederal Opposition has welcomed the Prime Minister’s 
announcement today, to significantly increase resources and implement 
more streamlined procedures to cope with the recent alarming increase 
in illegal immigrants.

Â

Shadow Minister for Immigration Con Sciacca today 
said that he was pleased the Prime Minister had finally responded positively 
to continued calls from the Opposition over recent months to vastly 
increase the capacity of Government Departments and Agencies to combat 
this serious crisis.

Â

“It’s about time,” Mr Sciacca said.

Â

“It has taken the Prime Minister’s Task Force 
over 2 1/2 months to come up with something that most people knew was 
at least part of the solution.

Â

Mr Sciacca said that massive cuts to expenditure over 
recent years by the Government had resulted in significant reductions 
in staffing and equipment levels for Coastwatch, Federal Police and 
Immigration personnel, particularly in our overseas posts. This had 
resulted in the crisis we are presently experiencing.

Â

“It has taken the Prime Minister’s Task Force 
under the chairmanship of Max ‘the axe’ Moore Wilton since 10 April 
to realise that the Government had made a serious mistake in making 
the cuts. They have now decided to restore resources to deal with a 
problem, which was of the Government’s own making.

Â

“The Opposition has been saying for months that 
the only way to combat the illegal immigrant and people smuggling problem 
was to employ more immigration and intelligence gathering personnel 
in those countries where people smugglers were most prevalent.

Â

“It is infinitely better to stop illegal immigrants 
from boarding a ship or a plane in the source country rather than to 
have to process, detain and deport them after they have arrived at enormous 
expense to the Australian taxpayer,” Mr Sciacca said.

Â

“There is no doubt that overseas criminal organisations 
had been encouraged by the lack of detection in recent months of several 
ships that landed off the Queensland and NSW’s coasts.

Â

“What does it say for the integrity of our national 
border when a fairly large vessel can sail 1000km down the Queensland 
coast undetected and end up on a Cairns beach and another travel 2000km 
down the same coastline and land at Coffs Harbour, NSW.

Â

“Given that since these incidents occurred, we have 
had weekly boat arrivals carrying illegal immigrants, there is no doubt 
that Australia is regarded as an easy target by the overseas people 
smuggling gangs,” Mr Sciacca said.

Â

Mr Sciacca said that he hoped that these new measures 
would go some way towards curbing this problem

Â

“After all, what is more important to the National 
Security of this Country than safeguarding the integrity of the national 
border.
