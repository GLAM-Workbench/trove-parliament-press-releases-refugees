AUSTRALIA’S RELATIONS WITH THF. SOUTH PACIFIC -  CHALLENGE AND CHANGE

ADDRESS BY THE HON GORDON BILNEY, MP, TO FOREIGN CORRESPONDENTS' ASSOCIATION, SYDNEY, 15 JUNE 1994.

ALMOST SIX YEARS AGO, IN SEPTEMBER 1988, SENATOR GARETH EVANS  MADE A LANDMARK ADDRESS TO THE FOREIGN CORRESPONDENTS’  ASSOCIATION, IN WHICH HE SET OUT THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENTS  POLICY APPROACH TO ITS RELATIONSHIPS IN THE SOUTH PACIFIC HE  OUTLINED A STRATEGY FOR MAINTAINING AND DEVELOPING A  PARTNERSHIP WITH PACIFIC ISLAND COUNTRIES WHICH PROMOTED  REGIONAL STABILITY THROUGH ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND THE  ENCOURAGEMENT OF SHARED PERCEPTIONS OF STRATEGIC AND SECURITY  INTERESTS. THAT STRATEGY, DUBBED "CONSTRUCTIVE COMMITMENT"  INVOLVED, CENTRALLY, THE PROMOTION OF CLOSE, CONFIDENT AND  BROADLY-BASED BILATERAL RELATIONS BETWEEN AUSTRALIA AND ALL  SOUTH PACIFIC COUNTRIES, AND THE PROMOTION OF EFFECTIVE REGIONAL  COOPERATION. IT WAS BASED ON OUR RESPECT FOR THE FULL  SOVEREIGNTY OF PACIFIC ISLAND COUNTRIES AND THE PROMOTION, AT THE  SAME TIME, OF SHARED PERCEPTIONS OF THE REGION'S STRATEGIC AND  SECURITY INTERESTS.

THERE IS, OBVIOUSLY, A CERTAIN PLEASING NEATNESS IN MY BEING ABLE  TO RETURN TO THIS VENUE TO LOOK AT WHERE WE’VE COME TO, SIX YEARS  LATER, AND I THANK YOU WARMLY FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO SO. THAT  I ÃÂÃÂ HERE IS, OF COURSE, A CONSEQUENCE OF MY APPOINTMENT,  FOLLOWING THE MARCH 1993 ELECTIONS, AS AUSTRALIA'S FIRST MINISTER  FOR PACIFIC ISLAND AFFAIRS. THAT APPOINTMENT ILLUSTRATES AND

CONFIRMS, AS MUCH AS ANYTHING COULD, THE AUSTRALIAN  GOVERNMENTS ENDURING COMMITMENT TO ITS RELATIONSHIPS IN THE  SOUTH PACIFIC REGION AND HAS, IN A NUMBER OF WAYS, ALLOWED US TO  GIVE FRESH EXPRESSION TO THAT COMMITMENT.

SINCE MY APPOINTMENT, I HAVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO TRAVEL  EXTENSIVELY IN THE REGION AND TO GET TO KNOW A NUMBER OF ITS  LEADERS AND A RANGE OF ITS CITIZENS. THIS PROCESS OF LEARNING MORE  ABOUT THE REGION - AND I READILY CONCEDE THAT I AM STILL

SCRATCHING THE SURFACE - HAS BEEN, FOR ME, INVALUABLE IN BOTH  HUMAN AND POLITICAL TERMS AND HAS CONFIRMED FOR ME THAT  AUSTRALIA'S RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE REGION ARE DEEPENING, ARE  GAINING IN TEXTURE. WE HAVE, FOR MANY GENERATIONS, HAD IMPORTANT  ECONOMIC AND TRADING RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE SOUTH PACIFIC.  DURING THE SECOND WORLD WAR AND AFTERWARDS, WE DEVELOPED A

RANGE OF SECURITY RELATED LINKS IN AND AROUND THE REGION. IN THE  PERIOD SINCE 1962, WHEN THE FIRST PACIFIC ISLAND COUNTRY, WESTERN  SAMOA, ACHIEVED ITS MODERN INDEPENDENCE, WE HAVE DEVELOPED A  WEB OF POLITICAL RELATIONSHIPS. NOW WE ARE, I THINK, BEGINNING TO

- 2 -

ENJOY THE BENEFITS OF A MORE FUNDAMENTAL, LESS FORMAL PROCESS OF  HUMAN AND SOCIAL CONTACT.

THE PERFORMANCE OF MANY PACIFIC ISLAND MEN AND WOMEN ON  AUSTRALIAN SPORTING FIELDS IS ONLY THE MOST SPECTACULAR EXAMPLE  OF THIS. IT IS ALSO DEMONSTRATED, MORE BROADLY, IN THE ROLE WHICH  GROWING ISLANDER COMMUNITIES ARE NOW PLAYING IN MULTICULTURAL  AUSTRALIA AS WELL, OF COURSE, BY THE PRESENCE, TEMPORARY AND  PERMANENT, OF A LARGE NUMBER OF AUSTRALIANS IN THE REGION. ITIS A  STRATUM OF CONTACT MADE BOTH EASIER AND MORE COMPLEX BY  TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE - THE EPIC SEA VOYAGES HAVE BEEN REPLACED  BY THE TELEVISION SETS WHICH ARE BRINGING MY IMAGE TO YOU TODAY.  MY EXPERIENCE OF THE REGION THUS FAR HAS CONVINCED ME THAT,  HISTORICAL AND CULTURAL DISPARITIES NOTWITHSTANDING,  AUSTRALIANS AND PACIFIC ISLAND PEOPLES UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER  WELL AND CAN WORK CONSTRUCTIVELY TOGETHER. FACED, AS WE ARE, BY  A NEW GENERATION OF GROWING AND EVER MORE URGENT CHALLENGES, IT  HAS NEVER BEEN MORE IMPORTANT THAT WE DO SO.

THAT SAID, IT CANNOT BE ASSUMED THAT THIS WILL HAPPEN AS A MATTER  OF COURSE. WE NEED TO WORK AT IT. THE AMOUNT OF PUBLIC ATTENTION  GIVEN TO THE SOUTH PACIFIC REGION IN AUSTRALIA HAS BEEN SPORADIC  AT BEST, AND OUR RELATIONS WITH THE REGION ARE ONLY ONE ELEMENT,  ALBEIT AN IMPORTANT ONE, OF AUSTRALIA'S INCREASINGLY COMPLEX WEB  OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONSHIPS.

CONSTRUCTIVE COMMITMENT, HAS, FROM THE AUSTRALIAN STANDPOINT  CERTAINLY, SERVED US VERY WELL. IT WILL REMAIN THE BASIS OF OUR  APPROACH TO OUR SOUTH PACIFIC RELATIONSHIPS. SIX YEARS IS,  HOWEVER, A LONG TIME IN WORLD AFFAIRS. THE PERIOD SINCE 1988 HAS  BEEN ONE OF MOMENTOUS, ACCELERATED CHANGE. THE COLD WAR HAS  COME TO AN END AND, WITH IT, THAT SET OF ARRANGEMENTS - THE  SUPERPOWER BALANCE - WITHIN OR AGAINST WHICH WE HAVE ALL, AS  NATIONS, DEFINED OURSELVES. THOSE ARRANGEMENTS HAD BEEN THE  GLOBAL ORGANISING PRINCIPLE FOR OVER FORTY YEARS; THAT IS, BACK TO  A TIME WHEN MOST OF THE PACIFIC ISLAND STATES WERE COLONIAL  POSSESSIONS AND AUSTRALIA WAS BEGINNING TO IDENTIFY ITSELF, AFTER  THE PACIFIC WAR, IN TERMS OTHER THAN THOSE OF THE OLD IMPERIAL  CONNECTION.

THAT SUPER POWER BALANCE HELD MANY TERRORS - AND IT IS AN  UNALLOYED GOOD THAT THEY ARE GONE - BUT GONE WITH THEM ALSO IS A  SET OF CERTAINTIES. THE END OF THE COLD WAR HAS BROUGHT, IF NOT A  NEW INTERNATIONAL ORDER, THEN CERTAINLY A NEW INTERNATIONAL  AGENDA. NEW CONFLICTS HAVE ERUPTED, NEW OPPORTUNITIES HAVE  ARISEN. THE CONCLUSION OF THE URUGUAY ROUND HAS BROUGHT A

SIGNIFICANT LIBERALISATION OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND PLACED A  PREMIUM ON TRADING COMPETITIVENESS. RAPIDLY, THE WORLD IS  REARRANGING ITSELF AROUND NEW STRUCTURES, DRIVEN FOR THE MOST

- 3 -

PART BY NEWLY EVOLVING ECONOMIC RELATIONSHIPS, RATHER THAN  MORE TRADITIONAL SECURITY CONCERNS. WE CONTINUE TO LIVE IN A  WORLD OF SOVEREIGN STATES - AND IN A NUMBER OF PARTS OF THE  WORLD, OLD SOVEREIGNTIES AND ETHNIC DIVIDES HAVE RE-EMERGED - BUT  A RANGE OF CONTEMPORARY TRANSNATIONAL ISSUES IS ALSO LEADING TO  REDEFINITIONS OF THE LIMITS OF SOVEREIGN POWER. EVEN IF IT WERE  EVER TRUE THAT INDIVIDUAL NATIONS WERE ISLANDS UNTO THEMSELVES -  AND I DOUBT WHETHER THAT WAS EVER A MEANINGFUL NOTION - IT  CANNOT BE SO NOW. CROSS-BORDER ENVIRONMENT PROBLEMS,  UNREGULATED POPULATION FLOWS, REFUGEES, INTERNATIONAL  TERRORISM, THE NARCOTICS TRADE AND INTERNATIONAL CRIME AND  HEALTH PROBLEMS SUCH AS AIDS ALL DEMAND OUR URGENT ATTENTION.

THE EIGHTIES AND NINETIES HAVE BEEN A PERIOD OF SEARCHING  CHALLENGE FOR AUSTRALIA. WE, LIKE OTHERS, HAVE HAD TO ADJUST TO  THE REALITIES OF THE POST COLD WAR WORLD. BUT BEFORE THIS, WE  HAVE HAD TO RESPOND TO THE CHALLENGE OF SUBSTANTIALLY  MODERNISING OUR ECONOMY AND GRASPING THE OPPORTUNITIES  PROVIDED BY THE DYNAMIC GROWTH OF THE ASIA/PACIFIC RIM BY OPENING  IT TO COMPETITION AFTER DECADES OF WHAT HAD PROVEN TO BE A  STULTIFYING REGIME OF PROTECTION BEHIND HIGH TARIFF WALLS. WE  HAVE HAD TO UNDERGO, OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS, AN EXTENDED AND AT  TIMES PAINFUL PERIOD OF ECONOMIC REFORM AND RESTRUCTURING WHICH  HAS REQUIRED OF US DIFFICULT DECISIONS AND A DISCIPLINED APPROACH  TO POLICY MAKING. IT HAS NOT BEEN AN EASY PROCESS, BUT IT IS AN  ESSENTIAL ONE FOR ANY NATION SEEKING TO IMPROVE THE LIVING

STANDARDS OF ITS PEOPLE AND TO ENSURE ITS WELL-BEING. THE  ALTERNATIVE - ECONOMIC STAGNATION - IS NOT A VALID OPTION FOR ANY  SELF-RESPECTING NATION. I BELIEVE THAT THE GOVERNMENTS  ACHIEVEMENTS IN THIS AREA HAVE BEEN SUBSTANTIAL, AND WE ARE NOW,  I THINK, STARTING TO SEE SOME OF THE FRUITS OF OUR LABOURS. THE  WORK, HOWEVER, IS FAR FROM COMPLETE - WE MUST CONTINUE IF WE ARE  TO SECURE OUR FUTURE.

I REHEARSE THIS HISTORY, AND OUTLINE THE CHALLENGES FACING  AUSTRALIA, TO MAKE TWO WIDER POINTS. FIRST, AUSTRALIA IS NOT ALONE  IN THE REGION, ANY MORE THAN IT IS ALONE IN THE WORLD, IN HAVING TO  FACE UP TO THE CHALLENGES OF THE NEW INTERNATIONAL AGENDA. THE  ISSUES FACED BY AUSTRALIA ARE ALSO FACED, IN VARYING DEGREES AND  PARTICULARS, BY OUR NEIGHBOURS IN THE SOUTH PACIFIC.

SECONDLY, AND THOUGH MANY CHALLENGES LIE AHEAD FOR US, THE  MASSIVE CHANGES AUSTRALIA HAS ALREADY MANAGED GIVE US  SOMETHING OF CREDENTIAL IN OUR DEALINGS WITH OTHERS WHO ARE  EMBARKING ON THE SAME PATH. I'M NOT SAYING AUSTRALIA HAS "BEEN  THERE AND DONE THAT', BUT WE ARE SOME WAY ALONG THE PATH, WE

KNOW SOME OF THE TRAPS AND PITFALLS, AND WE KNOW HOW STEEP THE  PATH CAN BECOME. AND ITS RIGHT THAT WE SHOULD HELP OUR FRIENDS,  BY POINTING OUT THE OBSTACLES AND HOW TO AVOID THEM.

- 4 -

ÃÂÃÂ IS A STRIKING MEASURE OF HOW MUCH HAS CHANGED, WHEN REÂ­ READING THE CONSTRUCTIVE COMMITMENT SPEECH, THAT TWO OF THE KEY  INTERESTS WE DEFINE FOR OURSELVES IN RESPECT OF THE REGION ARE IN  "KEEPING THE REGION FREE FROM DESTABILISING ACTIVITY BY AN  EXTERNAL POWER OR GROUP" AND "IN MINIMISING SUPERPOWER TENSION  IN THE REGION". THE SECOND PROPOSITION IS NO LONGER AN ISSUE. THE  FIRST STILL IS; EXTERNAL INFLUENCES OF VARIOUS KINDS, NATIONAL AND

NON-NATIONAL, CONTINUE TO OPERATE IN THE REGION AND THESE  INFLUENCES CANNOT ALWAYS BE ASSUMED TO BE BENIGN. BUT THAT SAID,  HAS THERE NOT BEEN, TO PUT IT BLUNTLY, AN OBSERVABLE SHIFTING OF  ATTENTION AWAY FROM THE SOUTH PACIFIC REGION ON THE PART OF SOME  OF ITS MORE TRADITIONAL PARTNERS AS THEY HAVE FOUND THEMSELVES  HAVING TO ADDRESS PRESSING PRIORITIES ELSEWHERE? DOES THIS NOT  MAKE IT ALL THE MORE URGENT THAT, AS A REGION, WE STRIVE TO ATTUNE

OURSELVES AS CLOSELY AS POSSIBLE TO CHANGED GLOBAL  CIRCUMSTANCES? AND, EVEN MORE CENTRALLY, DOES IT NOT MEAN THAT  IT IS UP TO US; THAT, PARADOXICALLY IN THIS INCREASINGLY  INTERDEPENDENT WORLD, WE ARE MUCH MORE ON OUR OWN, AND THAT WE  MUST LOOK TO OURSELVES, MAKING THE BEST OF WHAT WE HAVE, IF WE  ARE TO SECURE A SUSTAINABLE REGIONAL FUTURE?

CURRENT ISSUES IN PACIFIC ISLAND COUNTRIES: SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT OR BUST?

I INTEND TO FOCUS MY REMAINING COMMENTS TODAY ON THE  CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES FACED BY COUNTRIES OF THE REGION IN  THEIR EFFORTS TO IMPROVE THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL PROSPECTS FOR  THE PRESENT AND FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS. I SHOULD POINT OUT THAT  IN DOING SO I WILL NOT BE TRYING TO PRESENT A COMPREHENSIVE  PICTURE OF ALL THE IMPORTANT ISSUES FACING THE REGION. RATHER, I  WILL BE CONCENTRATING ON A NUMBER OF KEY FACTORS WHICH MUST BE  ADDRESSED BY GOVERNMENTS WITH A SENSE OF URGENCY IF SUSTAINABLE  DEVELOPMENT IS TO BE ACHIEVED IN THE SOUTH PACIFIC.

I ALSO WANT TO POSE SOME QUESTIONS CONCERNING THE FUTURE OF THE  REGION - QUESTIONS WHICH MUST BE ADDRESSED BY NATIONAL  GOVERNMENTS IF THE REGION IS TO HAVE A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE.

AS YOU ARE ALL AWARE, THE CONCEPT OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT  HAS TAKEN ON INCREASING INTERNATIONAL IMPORTANCE SINCE THE  CONCLUSION OF THE UNTIED NATIONS CONFERENCE ON DEVELOPMENT -  UNCED - IN 1992. I BELIEVE THAT IT IS ESSENTIAL FOR THE FUTURE  DEVELOPMENT OF THE REGION THAT THIS CONCEPT FORM THE BASIS OF  NATIONAL GOVERNMENT POLICIES.

IN ADDRESSING WHAT WE WILL HAVE TO DO TO SECURE THAT SUSTAINABLE  FUTURE, I AM NOT IGNORING THE FACT THAT SOME COUNTRIES IN THE  REGION CONTINUE TO FACE DIFFICULT AND COMPLEX POLITICAL ,

- 5 -

CONSTITUTIONAL AND SECURITY ISSUES THE RESOLUTION OF WHICH IS  FUNDAMENTAL TO THE REALISATION OF THEIR FULL ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL  POTENTIAL. THE ON-GOING PROBLEMS ON BOUGAINVILLE, THE RESOLUTION  OF FIJI'S CONSTITUTIONAL SITUATION AND THE PROGRESS OF THE  MATIGNON ACCORD PROCESS IN NEW CALEDONIA ARE ALL ISSUES OF VITAL  IMPORTANCE TO THE LONG TERM FUTURE OF THE REGION. AUSTRALIA IS  AND WILL REMAIN AN UNDERSTANDING OBSERVER OF THESE ISSUES AND  WILL LEND ASSISTANCE IN THEIR RESOLUTION WHERE SUCH ASSISTANCE IS  REQUESTED AND WHERE ÃÂÃÂ ACCORDS WITH OUR OWN INTERESTS.

HOWEVER, I DO BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE SOME BROADER ISSUES WHICH  RELATE DIRECTLY TO THE LONG TERM FUTURE OF THE COUNTRIES OF THE  SOUTH PACIFIC, WHICH IF NOT ADDRESSED WITH A SENSE OF URGENCY,  COULD HAVE CONSEQUENCES WHICH WOULD MAKE THOSE MORE

IMMEDIATE POLITICAL PROBLEMS SEEM SMALL BY COMPARISON.

I DO NOT SEEK TO PAINT A PICTURE OF A REGION IN STATE OF CRISIS. BUT I  DO WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THE FACT THAT POLICY MAKERS IN THE REGION  TODAY FACE A VERY DIFFERENT SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES THAN THEIR  PREDECESSORS AND THAT IN SOME CASES THE NEED FOR SERIOUS AND  URGENT ACTION IS ALREADY UPON US.

I AM ALSO CONSCIOUS THAT MANY OF THE PROBLEMS FACED BY THE  REGION AFFECT DIFFERENT ISLAND COUNTRIES IN VARYING WAYS AND TO  VARYING EXTENTS, AND THAT FORMULAS FOR ADDRESSING THESE  PROBLEMS CANNOT ALWAYS BE EASILY DEFINED OR APPLIED. I DO SO, TOO,  IN THE KNOWLEDGE THAT SOUTH PACIFIC ISLAND COUNTRIES HAVE,  THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD OF THEIR MODERN INDEPENDENCE, FACED A  SERIES OF DIFFICULTIES AND LIMITATIONS DICTATED IN LARGE MEASURE  BY GEOGRAPHIC ISOLATION, SMALL DOMESTIC MARKETS, NARROW  PRODUCTIVE BASES AND VULNERABILITY TO NATURAL DISASTERS, AND  THAT THE HISTORY OF THIS PERIOD HAS BEEN MARKED BY EFFORTS TO

ADDRESS THESE PROBLEMS.

THOSE EFFORTS NOTWITHSTANDING, IT IS UNFORTUNATELY THE CASE THAT  , OVER THE PAST DECADE MOST PACIFIC ISLAND COUNTRIES HAVE  ACHIEVED ONLY SLOW GROWTH IN REAL PER CAPITA INCOMES DESPITE A  GENERALLY FAVOURABLE NATURAL AND HUMAN RESOURCE ENDOWMENT,  HIGH LEVELS OF EXTERNAL ASSISTANCE AND GENERALLY SOUND  ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT. THIS PHENOMENON HAS BEEN WIDELY

CHARACTERISED IN A RANGE OF STUDIES AND REPORTS AS THE "PACIFIC  PARADOX".

THE WORLD BANK HIGHLIGHTED THE DISAPPOINTING DEVELOPMENT  PERFORMANCE OF THE SOUTH PACIFIC IN ITS 1993 ECONOMIC REPORT ON  THE REGION WHEN IT ESTIMATED THAT REAL GROSS NATIONAL PRODUCT IN  PACIFIC ISLAND COUNTRIES GREW BY AN AVERAGE RATE OF ONLY ABOUT  0.1 PER CENT ANNUALLY OVER THE PREVIOUS TEN YEARS. THE REPORT  ALSO POINTED TO THE CONTRAST BETWEEN THE SLOW ECONOMIC GROWTH

- 6 -

OF PACIHC ISLAND COUNTRIES AND THE MUCH HIGHER GROWTH RATES OF  SOME INDIAN OCEAN AND CARIBBEAN ISLAND COUNTRIES.

IN SHORT, WHATEVER POLICIES WE'VE BEEN FOLLOWING IN THE SOUTH  PACIFIC - AND BY "WE" I MEAN ISLAND COUNTRIES AND DONOR COUNTRIES  ALIKE - ARE DEMONSTRABLY NOT WORKING - AND NOT JUDGED BY SOME  ALIEN STANDARD, BUT BY THE YARDSTICK OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT  WE'VE ALL SET OURSELVES. WHY NOT?

IT IS CLEARLY THE RESPONSIBILITY OF BOTH NATIONAL GOVERNMENTS  AND DONOR COUNTRIES TO ASK THEMSELVES WHY THE REGION HAS  PERFORMED AT THIS DISAPPOINTING LEVEL. I FOR ONE DO NOT THINK THE  CONSTRAINTS TO DEVELOPMENT WHICH I HAVE MENTIONED ABOVE, OR THE  LACK OF SUFFICIENT EXTERNAL ASSISTANCE, PROVIDE THE FULL ANSWER  TO THIS QUESTION. RATHER, I WOULD CONTEND THAT THE POLICY  FRAMEWORKS ADOPTED IN THE REGION HAVE OFTEN RETARDED THE  PROSPECTS FOR LONGTERM SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC GROWTH. UNTIL  APPROPRIATE NATIONAL POLICIES ARE IMPLEMENTED LITTLE  IMPROVEMENT CAN BE EXPECTED.

SO WHAT ARE THE CONSEQUENCES OF CONTINUING SLOW ECONOMIC  GROWTH IN THE REGION? AND DOES IT MATTER?

THE LACK OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, WHEN COMBINED WITH HIGH  POPULATION GROWTH RATES, UNSUSTAINABLE EXPLOITATION OF NATURAL  RESOURCES AND RAPIDLY RISING COMMUNITY EXPECTATIONS, HAS LED TO

A GROWING RANGE OF SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC PROBLEMS, INCLUDING  PERMANENT ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION. ALREADY, IN SOME AREAS  OF THE REGION, HEALTH AND GENERAL LIVING STANDARDS APPEAR TO BE  DECLINING AND COMMUNITY SERVICES ARE UNDER STRAIN. NOR IS THE  REGION ISOLATED FROM WIDER GLOBAL HEALTH PROBLEMS SUCH AS  HIV/AIDS, MALARIA, NEO-NATAL TETANUS AND POLIO.

IN ADDITION, THE RUSH OF TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE IS ADDING TO  PRESSURES ON EXISTING SOCIAL AND POLITICAL STRUCTURES AND IS  CREATING, IN A NEW GENERATION, HEIGHTENED SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC  EXPECTATIONS WHICH MAY NOT BE REALISABLE.

RECENTLY THE ATTENTION OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY WAS  FOCUSSED ON THESE PROBLEMS AT THE GLOBAL CONFERENCE ON  SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT IN SMALL ISLAND STATES IN BARBADOS,  WHICH I ATTENDED. THIS CONFERENCE RESULTED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF  AN AGREED PLAN OF ACTION WHICH, IF FOLLOWED UP BY CONCERTED  ACTIVITY AT NATIONAL, REGIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL LEVELS, SHOULD  LEAD TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF MORE EFFECTIVE AND SUSTAINABLE  DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIES.

OF PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE IS THE NEED FOR NATIONAL GOVERNMENTS  TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT SOUND NATIONAL POLICIES TO ADDRESS

- 7 -

PRIORITY ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES SUCH AS POPULATION GROWTH,  FISHERIES, LOGGING AND COASTAL ZONE MANAGEMENT, ABOUT WHICH I  WOULD LIKE TO SAY MORE LATER. NO AMOUNT OF REGIONAL AND  INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE WILL BRING ABOUT SUSTAINABLE  DEVELOPMENT IN THE SOUTH PACIFIC UNLESS THE COUNTRIES OF THE  REGION THEMSELVES PLAY THE LEADING ROLE THROUGH THE ADOPTION OF

SUCH NATIONAL POLICIES, INCLUDING PUBLIC SECTOR REFORM AND  PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT.

THIS REFORM PROCESS MAY INVOLVE THOROUGH-GOING REAPPRAISAL BY  ISLAND COUNTRIES OF THE WAY IN WHICH THEY HAVE DONE THINGS  BEFORE. ISLAND COUNTRIES MAY NEED TO ASK THEMSELVES, AS  AUSTRALIANS HAVE HAD DO IN RECENT YEARS, WHETHER SOME OLD

SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC HABITS AND ATTITUDES MIGHT NEED TO BE  ADAPTED - OR EVEN ABANDONED - IF POSITIVE AND BENEFICIAL CHANGE IS  TO BE SECURED AND LONGER TERM SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC ASPIRATIONS  MET.

I AM AWARE OF THE VIEW, REFLECTED MOST RECENTLY AT THE STANDING  COMMITTEE OF THE PACIFIC ISLAND CONFERENCE OF LEADERS IN HAWAII IN  APRIL THIS YEAR, THAT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT SHOULD TAKE

APPROPRIATE ACCOUNT OF TRADITIONAL CULTURAL AND SOCIAL VALUES.  OF COURSE ÃÂÃÂ SHOULD. ON THE OTHER HAND, IT IS ONLY REASONABLE TO  ASSUME THAT THE PREPAREDNESS OF INVESTORS AND AID PARTNERS ALIKE

TO CONTINUE TO PLAY A ROLE IN THE SOUTH PACIFIC WILL DEPEND ON HOW  WELL INDIVIDUAL COUNTRIES FORMULATE AND IMPLEMENT THE ECONOMIC  AND STRUCTURAL REFORMS NECESSARY FOR SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC  DEVELOPMENT.

I WOULD ALSO QUESTION WHETHER THE UNSUSTAINABLE EXPLOITATION OF  RESOURCES WHICH IS CURRENTLY OCCURRING IN SOME COUNTRIES, AND  WHICH WILL LEAVE FUTURE GENERATIONS WITH A LEGACY OF PERMANENT  ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE AND REDUCED ECONOMIC PROSPECTS, IS IN LINE  WITH THESE TRADITIONAL VALUES. I THINK NOT, INDEED I’M CERTAIN OF IT.

I WOULD LIKE NOW TO TOUCH BRIEFLY ON SOME OF THE SPECIFIC  DEVELOPMENT AND RESOURCE MANAGEMENT ISSUES WHICH PACIFIC  ISLAND COUNTRIES NOW FACE.

ENVIRONMENT AT. MANAGEMENT

THE SOUTH PACIFIC REGION CONTAINS SOME UNIQUE ENVIRONMENTAL  TREASURES AND HAS AMONG THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF BIODIVERSITY OF  ANY REGION ON THIS PLANET. THE TROPICAL RAINFORESTS OF PAPUA NEW  GUINEA, THE BEAUTIFUL MAROVO LAGOON IN SOLOMON ISLANDS, THE  UNIQUE ATOLL ENVIRONMENTS OF KIRIBATI AND TUVALU AND MANY

OTHER AREAS IN THE REGION ARE ENVIRONMENTAL ASSETS OF WORLD  STANDING AND VALUE. WITH THE RIGHT MIX OF GOVERNMENT POLICIES  AND PRIVATE SECTOR INITIATIVE THESE ASSETS CAN AND SHOULD BE

-  8 -

UTILISED IN A SYMPATHETIC AND SUSTAINABLE MANNER TO ENSURE THAT  BOTH THEIR ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECONOMIC VALUE ARE PRESERVED FOR  GENERATIONS TO COME.

ONE WAY OF DOING THIS IS THROUGH THE DEVELOPMENT OF  ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY TOURISM INDUSTRIES, OR, IN THE MODERN  IDIOM, ECO TOURISM. AS WE ALL KNOW, THE SOUTH PACIFIC HAS AN  ENVIABLE REPUTATION AS A TOURIST DESTINATION, BASED IN LARGE PART  ON THE ATTRACTION OF THE REGION'S BEAUTIFUL COASTAL  ENVIRONMENTS AND UNIQUE CULTURAL HISTORY. ITS ALSO A SITUATION  WHERE, AS THE WORLD BECOMES MORE CROWDED OVER TIME, THE  DISADVANTAGE OF GEOGRAPHIC ISOLATION BECOMES AN ATTRACTION, THE

CHANCE TO GET AWAY FROM IT ALL. IN MANY COUNTRIES, THE FULL  POTENTIAL OF THE TOURISM INDUSTRY IS YET TO BE REALISED. NEW  FORMS OF TOURISM, AND PROVISION FOR SPECIALIST INTEREST GROUPS  SUCH AS ADVENTURE ENTHUSIASTS, ARE ONLY IN THEIR EMBRYONIC

STAGES BUT THE POTENTIAL FOR FURTHER DEVELOPMENT IS  CONSIDERABLE.

THE WINNING OF THE OLYMPIC GAMES BY SYDNEY IN THE YEAR 2000 WILL  FOCUS GLOBAL ATTENTION ON OUR REGION. IT WILL PROVIDE AN  OPPORTUNITY FOR SOUTH PACIFIC COUNTRIES TO GAIN CONSIDERABLE  BENEFIT, IF THEY ARE ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE EXPECTED

INFLUX OF VISITORS BY DEVELOPING ATTRACTIVE AND SUSTAINABLE  TOURIST FACILITIES. AS LONG, THAT IS, AS THAT DEVELOPMENT IS  COMPATIBLE WITH WHAT MAKES ISLAND LOCATIONS ATTRACTIVE IN THE  FIRST PLACE.

HOWEVER FOR THE TOURISM INDUSTRY TO CONTINUE TO GROW IT IS  IMPORTANT THAT NATIONAL GOVERNMENTS ESTABLISH A STABLE POLICY  FRAMEWORK WHICH PROMOTES QUALITY FOREIGN INVESTMENT,  INTERNATIONALLY COMPETITIVE WORK PRACTICES, AND SUSTAINABLE AND

SENSITIVE DEVELOPMENT THROUGH CAREFUL COASTAL ZONE  MANAGEMENT.

IT IS, UNFORTUNATELY, ALSO THE CASE THAT ISLAND COUNTRIES  CURRENTLY FACE A RANGE OF SPECIFIC ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS  INCLUDING DEFORESTATION, COASTAL POLLUTION AND DEGRADATION,  DEPLETION OF IN-SHORE FISHERIES AND DAMAGE TO CORAL REEFS,  INADEQUATE WATERSHED MANAGEMENT, A SHORTAGE OF CLEAN DRINKING  WATER AND EFFECTIVE WASTE MANAGEMENT FACILITIES, ALL  UNDERPINNED, AS IT WERE, BY THE POSSIBLE EFFECTS OF GLOBAL CLIMATE  CHANGE. UNLESS ADDRESSED COMPREHENSIVELY BY GOVERNMENTS,  THESE PROBLEMS THREATEN TO DESTROY THE POTENTIAL FOR SENSITIVE  AND SUSTAINABLE TOURISM DEVELOPMENT BEFORE IT HAS HAD THE  CHANCE TO DEVELOP FULLY.

- 9 -

POPULATION GROWTH AND HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT

THE MOST VALUABLE RESOURCE OF ANY COUNTRY IS ITS PEOPLE AND THIS  IS IN MANY WAYS ALL THE MORE TRUE FOR THE COUNTRIES OF THE SOUTH  PACIFIC

HOWEVER, WHILE SOUTH PACIFIC COUNTRIES CONTAIN SMALL  POPULATIONS, (IN RELATIVE TERMS), THEIR POPULATION GROWTH RATES  ARE IN SOME CASES AMONG THE HIGHEST IN THE WORLD. THE IMPACT OF  THESE HIGH POPULATION GROWTH RATES ON COUNTRIES WHICH HAVE HAD

A DISAPPOINTING RECORD OF ECONOMIC GROWTH OVER THE PAST DECADE  AND ENJOY ONLY A LIMITED AND FRAGILE RESOURCE BASE HAS IN SOME  CASES ALREADY CONTRIBUTED TO A REAL DECLINE IN LIVING STANDARDS.

MANY OF YOU WILL BE AWARE OF THE WORK OF THE PACIFIC 2010  RESEARCH PROJECT, CARRIED OUT BY THE AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL  UNIVERSITY’S CENTRE FOR DEVELOPMENT STUDIES UNDER THE AUSPICES  OF THE AUSTRALIAN AID PROGRAM, TO ALERT POLICY MAKERS TO THE REAL  DANGERS OF UNCONTROLLED POPULATION GROWTH. IT PAINTS A

NIGHTMARE VISION OF MASS UNEMPLOYMENT, URBAN SLUMS,  UNRE ALI SABLE DEMANDS ON ALREADY STRETCHED GOVERNMENT  SERVICES, GROWING LAWLESSNESS AND A DEGRADED ENVIRONMENT IF  CURRENT HIGH POPULATION GROWTH RATES REMAIN UNCHECKED.

AS WITH ALL DOOMSDAY SCENARIOS IT ONLY ILLUSTRATES A POSSIBLE  FUTURE. THE WORST CASES CAN BE AVOIDED THROUGH URGENT AND  SUSTAINED ACTION BY ISLAND GOVERNMENTS, WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF

DEVELOPMENT PARTNERS SUCH AS AUSTRALIA. THIS IS NOT AN EASY TASK,  AS THE ACHIEVEMENT OF LOWER POPULATION GROWTH RATES REQUIRES A  CAREFUL MIX OF POLICIES WHICH PROMOTE ECONOMIC GROWTH AND  SECURITY, EXTEND THE QUALITY AND ACCESSIBILITY OF HEALTH AND  FAMILY PLANNING SERVICES, EDUCATION AND TRAINING, AND ENHANCE, IN  PARTICULAR, WOMEN'S RIGHTS, STATUS AND BREADTH OF CHOICE.

THERE HAS BEEN A GREATER RECOGNITION BY SOUTH PACIFIC COUNTRIES  IN RECENT YEARS OF THIS CRITICAL LINK BETWEEN POPULATION GROWTH,  SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRITY, INCLUDING  BY HEADS OF GOVERNMENT AT LAST YEAR'S SOUTH PACIFIC FORUM IN  NAURU. MUCH, HOWEVER, REMAINS TO BE DONE.

FISHERIES AND OTHER MARITIME RESOURCES

ASIDE FROM THEIR PEOPLE, THE MOST IMPORTANT NATURAL RESOURCES  FOR MANY PACIFIC ISLANDS COUNTRIES, AND IN SOME CASES THEIR ONLY  RESOURCES, ARE THOSE CONTAINED IN THEIR HUGE EXCLUSIVE ECONOMIC

ZONES. ALTHOUGH SMALL IN TERMS OF LAND AREA, THE SOUTH PACIFIC  ISLAND COUNTRIES HAVE SOVEREIGNTY OVER 20 MILLION SQUARE  KILOMETRES OF OCEAN AND THE RESOURCES WHICH THIS VAST AREA  CONTAINS. THIS AREA SUPPLIES APPROXIMATELY 50 PERCENT OF THE

-  1 0 -

WORLD’S CANNING TUNA, WITH THE ANNUAL HARVEST OF AROUND ONE  MILLION TONNES WORTH COMMERCIALLY AROUND $1.5 BILLION PER YEAR.  IT IS TRULY ONE OF THE WORLD'S GREAT FISHERIES - INDEED ONE OF ITS  LAST - AND NEEDS TO BE HARVESTED SUSTAINABLY IN ORDER TO ENSURE  THAT FUTURE GENERATIONS ARE ABLE TO PROSPER FROM ITS BOUNTY.

OF EQUAL IMPORTANCE TO MANY COUNTRIES IS THE IN-SHORE FISHERIES  RESOURCE WHICH PROVIDES BOTH A VALUABLE FOOD SOURCE AND SOURCE  OF INCOME FOR MANY PEOPLE. HIGH POPULATION GROWTH RATES AND  RELATED ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION HAVE PLACED THIS RESOURCE  UNDER ENORMOUS PRESSURE AND IT WILL ONLY BE THROUGH URGENT AND

SUSTAINED IMPLEMENTATION OF SUSTAINABLE MANAGEMENT POLICIES  THAT IT WILL CONTINUE TO PROVIDE FOR EVER GROWING POPULATIONS.

THE EXPERIENCE OF MANY COUNTRIES, SADLY INCLUDING OUR OWN, IS  THAT OVEREXPOITATION OF MARINE RESOURCES CAN CAUSE IRREPARABLE  DAMAGE TO STOCK LEVELS AND CONSEQUENTLY DESTROY THE CAPACITY  TO MAINTAIN A VIABLE INDUSTRY IN THE LONG TERM. WHILE COUNTRIES

OF THE REGION ARE SMALL, AND OF LIMITED INFLUENCE AS INDIVIDUAL  ENTITIES COMPARED WITH THE MAJOR DISTANT WATER FISHING NATIONS,  PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE HAS SHOWN THAT BY DEVELOPING A COOPERATIVE  APPROACH THEY CAN TAKE GREATER CONTROL OF THESE RESOURCES AND  ENSURE THEIR SUSTAINABLE AND EQUITABLE DEVELOPMENT.

ACHIEVEMENTS SUCH AS THE WELLINGTON CONVENTION - WHICH SAW A  GLOBAL BAN PLACED ON THE HORRENDOUS AND WASTEFUL PRACTICE OF  DRIFT NETTING - AND THE SUCCESSFUL CONCLUSION OF AN EQUITABLE  MULTILATERAL FISHERIES ACCESS AGREEMENT WITH THE UNTIED STATES,  ARE DEMONSTRATIONS OF THE VALUE OF CLOSE REGIONAL COOPERATION.  MUCH REMAINS TO BE DONE IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT THE PACIFIC  ISLAND COUNTRIES DERIVE THE MAXIMUM SUSTAINABLE BENEFIT FROM  THIS MOST VALUABLE OF RESOURCES. OF VITAL IMPORTANCE IS THE NEED  TO ENSURE THAT THOSE DISTANT WATER FISHING NATIONS CURRENTLY  EXPLOITING THE SOUTH PACIFIC FISHERIES RESOURCE DO NOT, BY  POACHING, INACCURATE CATCH REPORTING OR THE DUBIOUS INCENTIVE OF

SUPPOSEDLY COMPENSATORY AID FUNDS, DEPRIVE ISLAND COUNTRIES OF  WHAT IS RIGHTFULLY THEIRS, A FAIR PRICE FOR THEIR RESOURCE.

FORESTRY

IN SOME COUNTRIES IN THE REGION, RAMPANT EXPLOITATION OF TROPICAL  FORESTS BY FOREIGN INTERESTS HAS ALREADY CAUSED SERIOUS  ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL PROBLEMS. SOME ISLANDS WILL BE  COMPLETELY DENUDED OF COMMERCIALLY VIABLE FORESTS BEFORE THE  TURN OF THE CENTURY AND OTHERS WILL BE IRREPARABLY DAMAGED IF  THE CURRENT UNSUSTAINABLE RATES OF EXPLOITATION ARE ALLOWED TO

CONTINUE. THIS IN TURN WILL REDUCE THE CAPACITY OF THE LAND TO  SUSTAIN RAPIDLY INCREASING POPULATIONS AND COULD LEAD TO A  VICIOUS CIRCLE OF POOR DEVELOPMENT PERFORMANCE. IT WILL ALSO

-  11 -

LEAD TO MAJOR ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS SUCH AS THE SELTATION OF  LAGOONS AND REEFS, AS WELL AS REDUCING IN-SHORE FISH STOCKS AND  DESTROYING THE POTENTIAL FOR TOURISM.

A FURTHER ASPECT OF THIS PROBLEM IS THAT SOME OF THOSE FOREIGN  INTERESTS INVOLVED IN THE FORESTRY SECTOR GAIN ACCESS TO THE  TIMBER RESOURCE AT MINIMAL COST AND GREATLY UNDERSTATE THE  VALUE OF THE RESOURCES THEY ARE TAKING OUT OF THE REGION,  DEPRIVING ISLAND COUNTRIES AND COMMUNITIES OF VERY SUBSTANTIAL  LEGITIMATE INCOME.

THE STORY IS NOT ALL DOOM AND GLOOM, AND COUNTRIES OF THE REGION  ARE BEGINNING TO IMPLEMENT POLICIES WHICH, IF MAINTAINED IN THE  LONG TERM, WILL LEAD TO A MORE SUSTAINABLE FORESTRY SECTOR. BUT  THIS WILL NOT BE AN EASY PROCESS GIVEN THE HIGH LEVEL OF RELIANCE  AT BOTH THE LOCAL AND NATIONAL LEVEL ON FORESTRY REVENUE.  REGIONAL POLICY MAKERS WILL CONTINUE TO FACE ACUTE POLICY  DILEMMAS AS THEY BALANCE THE NEEDS OF THE SHORT-TERM AGAINST  THOSE OF FUTURE GENERATIONS OF THEIR PEOPLE. AND YET, AGAIN,

SOMETHING MUST BE DONE.

TRADE AND INVESTMENT -

I NOW TURN FOR A FEW MOMENTS TO THE CRITICAL QUESTIONS OF TRADE  AND INVESTMENT AND PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT IN THE SOUTH  PACIFIC REGION. IT IS DIFFICULT TO OVERESTIMATE THE IMPORTANCE OF  THIS AREA OF POLICY FOR THE FUTURE WELL-BEING OF THE REGION. AS  THE 20TH CENTURY DRAWS TO A CLOSE THE WAY NATIONS RELATE TO EACH  OTHER IS INCREASINGLY BEING DETERMINED BY THEIR ECONOMIC  PERFORMANCE.

GIVEN THAT THE RELATIVELY GENEROUS LEVELS OF AID TO THE SOUTH  PACIFIC ARE UNLIKELY TO INCREASE IN THE COMING YEARS, THE  PROSPECTS FOR IMPROVED LIVING STANDARDS IN THE REGION WILL  INCREASINGLY DEPEND ON THE ADOPTION AND SUSTAINED PURSUIT OF

POLICIES WHICH FOSTER INCREASED TRADE AND ATTRACT QUALITY  FOREIGN INVESTMENT.

IT IS A RECOGNISED BUT UNFORTUNATE FACT THAT THE UNPRECEDENTED  RECENT ECONOMIC GROWTH OF THE BROADER ASIA-PACIFIC REGION HAS  LARGELY BYPASSED PACIFIC ISLAND COUNTRIES. ONE COMMENTATOR HAS,  IN FACT, DESCRIBED ISLAND COUNTRIES AS LYING IN THE EYE OF THE ASIA-  PACIFIC CYCLONE.

WHILE THE FAST-GROWING ASIAN ECONOMIES, WITH THEIR LARGE LABOUR  FORCES AND EXPANDING DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL MARKETS,  CLEARLY HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EDGE OVER THE MUCH SMALLER AND  RELATIVELY ISOLATED PACIFIC ISLAND STATES, THEIR SUCCESSES ARE  MORE THAN JUST A MATTER OF SIZE AND GEOGRAPHY. ASIAN

-  12 -

GOVERNMENTS HAVE TAKEN DELIBERATE STEPS TO ADOPT AND PURSUE  ECONOMIC POLICIES AIMED AT MOBILISING DOMESTIC SAVINGS AND  OPENING THEIR ECONOMIES TO QUALITY FOREIGN INVESTMENT - IN  INDUSTRY, SERVICES AND NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE. IT IS PERHAPS NOT  TOO HARSH A JUDGEMENT TO SAY THAT A NUMBER OF SOUTH PACIFIC  COUNTRIES ARE - TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY ARE ABLE - YET TO TAKE UP  THIS EXAMPLE.

IN THE INCREASINGLY OPEN INTERNATIONAL TRADING ENVIRONMENT  FOLLOWING THE URUGUAY ROUND, PREFERENTIAL ACCESS ARRANGEMENTS  OFFER LITTLE REMAINING ADVANTAGE TO DEVELOPING COUNTRIES IN THE  SOUTH PACIFIC OR ELSEWHERE. THERE IS NOW EFFECTIVELY NO REALISTIC  ALTERNATIVE TO COMPETITION AND THE PURSUIT OF COMPARATIVE

ADVANTAGE, NO MATTER HOW DAUNTING THESE CONCEPTS MAY APPEAR.  WHILE INTERNATIONAL AND EXTERNAL FACTORS ARE IMPORTANT  INFLUENCES ON A COUNTRY'S ECONOMIC FORTUNES, ECONOMIC  PERFORMANCE IS IMPORTANTLY DETERMINED BY THE POLICIES WHICH  EACH GOVERNMENT FORMULATES AND IMPLEMENTS. THIS HAS CERTAINLY  PROVED TO BE AUSTRALIA'S EXPERIENCE, AND I BELIEVE THAT MANY  PACIFIC ISLAND LEADERS ARE COMING TO A SIMILAR CONCLUSION.

PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT

WE BELIEVE THAT A CONFIDENT AND GROWING PRIVATE SECTOR IS ONE OF  THE KEYS TO THE SUCCESS OF ANY TRADE AND INVESTMENT STRATEGY. TO  REPEAT AN OLD TRUISM, "GOVERNMENTS DONT TRADE, BUSINESS DOES".

IT IS NOW GENERALLY ACCEPTED THAT THE PRIVATE SECTOR COULD  CONTRIBUTE MUCH MORE SUBSTANTIALLY IN THE FUTURE TO ECONOMIC  GROWTH AND EMPLOYMENT IN THE REGION, FOR EXAMPLE IN SMALL-SCALE  MANUFACTURING, AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND TOURISM.

SEVERAL ISLAND COUNTRIES ARE ALREADY WELL DOWN THIS PATH, AND  HAVE HAD SOME NOTABLE SUCCESSES IN ATTRACTING QUALITY FOREIGN  INVESTMENT PROJECTS WHICH HAVE HELPED, SOMETIMES SUBSTANTIALLY,  TO GENERATE EMPLOYMENT, DEVELOP NATIONAL MANUFACTURING BASES,

AND ENHANCE EXPORT INCOME. THIS CLEARLY INDICATES TO ME THAT  THERE IS FURTHER POTENTIAL FOR BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT IN THE SOUTH  PACIFIC.

FOR THIS POTENTIAL TO BE REALISED, HOWEVER, THE INVESTMENT  CLIMATE MUST BE COMPETITIVE AND THE RIGHT INSTITUTIONAL AND  ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT SHOULD BE AVAILABLE AT THE NATIONAL

LEVEL. WHILE OPINIONS VARY ON THE APPROPRIATENESS OF THE  DIFFERENT TYPES OF INCENTIVES WHICH GOVERNMENTS MAY USE TO  ATTRACT FOREIGN BUSINESS INVESTMENT, THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT  POTENTIAL INVESTORS WILL ONLY CHOOSE PACIFIC ISLAND COUNTRIES, IN  PREFERENCE TO OTHER DESTINATIONS, IF THEY CAN BE CONFIDENT OF  OPERATING IN AN ENVIRONMENT WHICH IS POSITIVE, PREDICTABLE AND

Â«.Â·

-  1 3 -

PROFITABLE. THIS REQUIRES DISCIPLINE AT BOTH THE GOVERNMENTAL  AND LABOUR MARKET LEVEL.

IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT FOR ANY COUNTRY SEEKING TO ATTRACT SOUND  FOREIGN INVESTMENT TO HAVE AN ADEQUATE LOCAL SKILLS BASE AT THE  MANAGEMENT AND TECHNICAL LEVEL, AND TO HAVE APPROPRIATE EXPORT  ENHANCEMENT MEASURES IN PLACE.

ONE PARTICULAR ISSUE THAT MUST BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IS FOR THE  SIZE AND COST OF PUBLIC SECTORS IN ISLAND COUNTRIES TO BE  CAREFULLY MANAGED SO THAT SUFFICIENT SCOPE IS AVAILABLE FOR  BUSINESS SECTOR GROWTH.

ON A POSSIBLY MORE SENSITIVE NOTE, I ALSO THINK IT IS NOW GENERALLY  RECOGNISED, INCLUDING BY ISLAND LEADERS, THAT THE TIME HAS COME  TO LOOK A BIT MORE CLOSELY AT TRADITIONAL LAND USE PATTERNS IN  SOUTH PACIFIC COUNTRIES, TO MAKE THEM, TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE,  MORE COMPATIBLE WITH THE NEEDS OF POTENTIAL INVESTORS, LOCAL AND  FOREIGN. OTHER DIFFICULT ISSUES, SUCH AS ENERGY CONSUMPTION  PATTERNS AND HEAVILY INDEBTED AND COSTLY NATIONAL AIRLINES, WILL  ALSO NEED TO BE CONSIDERED - URGENTLY - BY REFORM-MINDED ISLAND  GOVERNMENTS. "

THE FUTURE

IT MAY BE SAID BY SOME THAT I HAVE PAINTED AN UNNECESSARILY BLEAK  PICTURE OF THE SOUTH PACIFIC FUTURE. THAT IS NOT THE IMPRESSION I  WISH TO LEAVE WITH YOU. NOT ONLY AM I AN OPTIMIST BY NATURE, I ALSO  VERY SINCERELY BELIEVE THAT THE FUTURE HOLDS GREAT PROMISE FOR  THE SOUTH PACIFIC, AND THAT THIS PROMISE CAN BE REALISED IF ALL OF  ITS COUNTRIES WORK, BOTH INDIVIDUALLY AND CLOSELY TOGETHER, IN  BUILDING THAT FUTURE.

SOME WILL ALSO, INEVITABLY, ACCUSE ME OF SEEKING TO BE PRESCRIPTIVE  ABOUT THESE PROBLEMS. AGAIN, THAT IT NO PART OF MY INTENTION.  AUSTRALIA IN NO WAY SEEKS TO IMPOSE ITS OWN IDEAS ON ISLAND  COUNTRIES ABOUT THE SOLUTION TO THEIR PROBLEMS. WE KNOW WE

CANNOT DO SO AND WE ARE NOT ABOUT TO TRY. INDEED THOSE PROBLEMS  CAN ONLY BE ADDRESSED PROPERLY IF ISLAND COUNTRY LEADERS AND  PEOPLES COMMIT THEMSELVES AND THEIR OWN RESOURCES TO THE EFFORT

AND PARTICIPATE FULLY IN IT. AID DONORS CAN HELP, BUT THEIR EFFORTS  CAN ONLY BE IN SUPPORT OF THOSE OF THE ISLAND COUNTRIES  THEMSELVES.

WHAT I HAVE TRIED TO COMMUNICATE TODAY IS MY SENSE OF THE  URGENCY OF THE SITUATION. THE PROBLEMS I HAVE SPOKEN OF ARE  TODAY’S PROBLEMS, IN THE HERE AND NOW. THE STAKES ARE VERY HIGH.  THE CHALLENGES WE FACE CANNOT BE IGNORED, AND THE WAY WE

-  14 -

ADDRESS THEM WILL LARGELY DETERMINE THE OUTLOOK FOR FUTURE  GENERATIONS.

I HOPE THAT AUSTRALIA’S ENDURING COMMITMENT TO ITS CLOSE  RELATIONSHIPS WITH ITS SOUTH PACIFIC NEIGHBOURS, DEMONSTRATED  AND ACTED UPON OVER MANY YEARS NOW, DOES NOT NEED RE-STATING,  AND I HAVE NOT SOUGHT TO DO SO AT ANY LENGTH TODAY. SUFFICE IT TO

SAY THAT THOSE RELATIONSHIPS CONTINUE TO BE FUNDAMENTAL TO OUR  FOREIGN POLICY, INDEED TO OUR OWN SENSE OF NATIONHOOD. WE WANT,  AS WE HAVE IN THE PAST, TO WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH PACIFIC ISLAND  COUNTRIES IN ADDRESSING THE ISSUES THEY AND WE FACE. BUT I WOULD  SUGGEST THAT IF WE ARE TO MAKE REAL PROGRESS IN ADDRESSING THEM,  WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO PUT OURSELVES INTO A HIGHER GEAR. WE  CANNOT HOPE TO ACHIEVE WHAT, I THINK, WE ALL WANT TO ACHIEVE, IF  WE DO NOT GET BEYOND STOP-GAP MEASURES, EXTRAVAGANT NATIONAL

SYMBOLS AND HAPHAZARD AND UNCOORDINATED DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS.

AT THIS TIME OF FAR-REACHING INTERNATIONAL CHANGE, IT IS ESSENTIAL  THAT COUNTRIES OF THE REGION REALISE THAT THE LEVEL OF INTEREST OF  FOREIGN INVESTORS OR DONOR COUNTRIES IN THE SOUTH PACIFIC, WILL  DEPEND TO A LARGE EXTENT ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SOUND AND  SUSTAINABLE POLICIES BY NATIONAL GOVERNMENTS.

WE MUST ALL, IN SHORT, COMMIT OURSELVES TO THE NEW AGENDA OF  ISSUES WHICH A CHANGING WORLD HAS THROWN UP. WE MUST, I BELIEVE,  RECOGNISE THE SOMBRE TRUTH OF THE WORDS OF TWO RECENT  COMMENTATORS - AND I QUOTE THEM:

"IN THIS DAY AND AGE THE UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE PACIFIC  COUNT FOR LITTLE IN THE EYES OF THE OUTSIDE WORLD AS COUNTRIES  STRUGGLE FOR ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL SURVIVAL. IF THE ISLANDS ASPIRE  TO PROGRESS IN MODERN TERMS THE DECISION IS THEIRS AND THEIRS  ALONE."

IN EARLY AUGUST, IT WILL BE AUSTRALIA'S HONOUR TO HOST THE 1994  SOUTH PACIFIC FORUM MEETING, THE MOST SIGNIFICANT INTERNATIONAL  GATHERING TO TAKE PLACE IN AUSTRALIA THIS YEAR. IT IS THE FIRST TIME  WE HAVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO SO FOR ELEVEN YEARS. AT THAT  MEETING, WE HOPE NOT ONLY TO RECONFIRM AUSTRALIA’S  DETERMINATION TO WORK CLOSELY WITH OUR SOUTH PACIFIC  NEIGHBOURS. WE ALSO HOPE THAT THE LEADERS WILL HAVE THE  OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS TOGETHER, IN PERHAPS A NEW, MORE FOCUSSED  WAY, THE AGENDA OF ISSUES WE NOW FACE TOGETHER. WE HAVE, TO THIS  END, PROPOSED THAT THE OVER-ARCHING THEME OF THE FORUM SHOULD  BE "MANAGING OUR RESOURCES". THE RESPONSE FROM REGIONAL LEADERS  TO THIS PROPOSAL HAS BEEN POSITIVE. IT IS OUR HOPE THAT WE SHALL BE

ABLE TO SEIZE THAT MOMENT TO LAUNCH OURSELVES, WITH A FRESH  DETERMINATION, ON THE CRUCIAL TASK OF PREPARING OUR REGION FOR  THE CHALLENGES OF A NEW CENTURY. .
