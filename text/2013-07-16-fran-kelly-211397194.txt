Subjects: Comments of Indonesian Foreign Minister Marty Natalegawa, Coalition  policy to turn back boats where it is safe to do so, Papua New Guinea

E&OE

KELLY:  There has been a lot of commentary around the comments from the Indonesian  Foreign Minister made in the last 24 hours. What is your interpretation of Marty  Natalegawa’s comments?

MORRISON:

Well I think Mr Natalegawa is saying very plainly that he would continue to have  discussions with the Coalition if we were in government and I think that is  appropriate. Any Indonesian Government is going to deal with the government of the  day in Australia and I don’t think anyone would dispute that. What the purpose of  those discussions is I think is important. From our perspective it is about informing  Indonesia and having a no surprises policy which we have always said about this  issue. At the end of the day it is for Australia to make its own sovereign decisions  about our own national policies. Mr Natalegawa in the Sky interview I think made that  very clear that there can be national policies and that is a matter for Australia’s  sovereignty and we will make those decisions if we are in government. It is a false  test the Government and others have tried to put on this policy - we are not seeking  the agreement of Indonesia. We have never said that. John Howard never did as I  said on this program only last week. As a result that is not the end state of those  discussions. It is about having a clear communication because our policies at the  end of the day we believe will take the sugar off the table and we think that is the  most significant thing we can do to ensure that we end the people smuggling trade  through the region. Now there may be differences of views about that in the region.  That is fine and appropriate. But at the end of the day we are not going to have a  situation where effectively Australia’s national policies are decided in another place.

KELLY:

Ok so you don’t need agreement.

MORRISON:

No

KELLY:

That’s clear. But you do need cooperation don’t you and here we have the Foreign  Minister of Indonesia saying well he is not ecstatic about the push back policy and he  said quite clearly, this is a quote - ‘it would constitute a unilateral type of measure  we can’t support.’ I mean it is pretty unequivocal, we are not going to support it so  presumably they wouldn’t be too keen to cooperate with it.

MORRISON:

Well I think there are a couple of issues here where there is potentially  disagreement. I mean Bob Carr himself has made statements that he is concerned  about Indonesia’s policy about visa on arrival for Iranian nationals. I don’t think that  necessarily helps the process either but that is a sovereign decision for Indonesia.  They can make that decision. There are concerns about the search and response  capacity on search and rescue operations in Indonesia with very little capacity on the  southern Javan coast. There are a range of issues there but ultimately there are  sovereign decisions for both countries to take and we need to respect that. On the  issue of unilateral, if I understand what is being said about the communique in  Indonesia now it is this - Kevin Rudd has contracted away the right for Australia to  make a decision about its own national policies to Indonesia and has given them a  right of veto. Now that is not something a Coalition government would ever agree to.

KELLY:

I will come to that in a moment because that is quite a provocative statement you  have made there but to stay with this notion of cooperation, the policy as stands, as I  understand it, the Coalition in government would tow back boats to Indonesian  waters…

MORRISON:

We would turn back boats.

KELLY:

Turn back sorry where safe to do so, beg your pardon, turn back boats and leave  them in Indonesian waters. If Indonesia is not cooperating in this, what happens to  those boats there?

MORRISON:

The same thing Vice Admiral Ritchie said last time and Vice Admiral Ritchie himself  said the circumstances have not changed that much. That is one scenario.

KELLY:

What is that though that happened last time?

MORRISON:

Well they went back to the Indonesian shore. They went back as Indonesian flagged  vessels with Indonesian crew back to an Indonesian port they departed from  because that is the place they could get to. Those vessels were monitored from a  distance by the Australian navy at the time if they got into any distress.

KELLY:

So that would be the guarantee there…

MORRISON:

That is one scenario

KELLY:

…That Australia’s surveillance would monitor to make sure those boats didn’t sink or  get into trouble or…

MORRISON:

Or equally what happened last time. As you know Alexander Downer phoned the  Indonesian Foreign Minister at the time and advised him of the co-ordinates of those  vessels so they could also be monitored by the Indonesians. So that is how it worked

last time but as we discussed earlier there are a range of other different scenarios  that can present and we have discussed those in some precision with people who  are deeply experienced in these matters and we are very confident that the tactics  we will deploy at sea will be just as effective last time.

KELLY:

A good diplomatic relationship with Indonesia is important to Australia on a number  of fronts.

MORRISON:

Of course.

KELLY:

Not least of which is the trade front as it has a burgeoning middle class which is the  point Kevin Rudd was making last week. But the Indonesian Foreign Minister said  Australia can act in its own national interest, he said that, but there must be  [inaudible] efforts to make sure that national efforts are in sync with the regional  efforts...

MORRISON:

And that is absolutely right and we think that taking the sugar off the table, which is  actually drawing people through Indonesia and causing the chaos in the region,  exactly contributes to that point.

KELLY:

Does Indonesia agree with you?

MORRISON:

The point is what is the outcome? The outcome is will it lead to a reduction in people  smuggling and that is what the objective of these regional agreements are.

KELLY:

Or will it result from an Indonesian point of view with more people being stuck in  Indonesia. They already have got tens of thousands of people there waiting.

MORRISON:

Well let’s look at the history. When we did this last time the number of people going  through Indonesia reduced because those policies were effective. When you stop  the boats Indonesia’s problem also stops and that’s why our national policies we  believe would contribute to that objective. I think that is a meaningful discussion we  would be able to have with the Indonesians. But at the end of the day Fran we can  both have our views on various things that play to our cooperation and there are  many things that need to happen and are happening within Indonesia that we think  could happen at a whole different level and I think that is fertile ground for  cooperative discussion. But when it comes to our national policies I think it is a  matter of no surprises, clear dialogue and Mr Natalegawa is obviously committed to  continuing to have that discussion and that is welcome.

KELLY:

It is clear that you and Julie Bishop as Shadow Foreign Minister and Tony Abbott as  Opposition Leader have had discussions with Indonesian counterparts and I  presume in those discussions you have talked about whether Indonesia sees this as  a positive ultimately for them, taking the sugar off the table to use your terms, yet  Marty Natalegawa yesterday said - ‘what we wish to be avoiding is the situation  where the burden of responsibility is being shifted from one party to another.’ That  doesn’t sound as though he regards your policy as ultimately being helpful to  Indonesia in terms of less people arriving there.

MORRISON:

Well I think that is a bit of leap Fran but at the same time boats stopped coming to  Australia. That means planes stopped coming into Indonesia and that is ultimately  the objective that we have here. They are the practical objectives we will work to if  we are in government. The Indonesian government I am sure would deal with a  Coalition Government with the same respect. But to have a good relationship Fran  with Indonesia you have got to have respect and you have got to have respect  frankly for yourselves as well as each other and that means respecting  each other’s’  sovereign decisions  and sovereign rights to have our own border policies and make  those decisions. Now I am concerned that Bob Carr and Kevin Rudd are happy to  just hand those decisions over, effectively provide a right of veto over Australia’s  national policies on these issues by the explanation of the unilateral agreement that

was put out last night. Now if that is what that means - that Indonesia has to agree  to Australia’s national policies otherwise they are considered unilateral action and  outside the parameters of that discussion then I think that is a very concerning  development.

KELLY:

Isn’t is more likely that what it means is what all the experts have been telling us for  more than a decade now that any answer to this problem needs to be a regional one,  regional cooperation?

MORRISON:

Well I don’t disagree with that but that doesn’t give you an excuse not to have  national policies as well. It is not either/or you must have both.

KELLY:

But Australia does have national policies.

MORRISON:

Well the suggestion is that having a turn back policy or temporary protection visas or  any of the other policies we have is somehow not part of making a contribution to the  regional effort. The region has a Rudd problem. It is not the other way around. It was  Kevin Rudd who decided to take unilateral action all those years ago and get rid of  the policies that worked that has put us in this mess. And we now are in the situation  as you said in your introduction and Bob Carr is right - that the trend we are on  would see over 100,000 people turn up in the next three year term of a Rudd  Government. We are at the stage now of almost 1,000 people turning up a week  under Kevin Rudd. He is going to smash Julia Gillard’s record in his first month in  office.

KELLY:

There are more people seeking asylum around the world now than at any other time.

MORRISON:

Well that is actually not true Fran. You are talking about displaced people. You are  not talking about refugees. There are 10.5 million refugees classified by the UNHCR  in their own latest report. There were 12 million when John Howard was dealing with  this problem.

KELLY:

Initially and then there were many less.

MORRISON:

And there were 22% more asylum applications being made at the time John Howard  dealt with this problem than in the most recent figures of the UNHCR. Push factors  will always be there as we have always said.

KELLY:

But under the Howard Government there were many, many less.

MORRISON:

Well the push factors are consistent and strong. The difference is what do you do on  your own borders and that is what this debate is all about - what should we be doing  on your own borders. The Coalition - Tony Abbott and I and Julie Bishop believe  Australia should make those decisions. It concerns me that Bob Carr and Kevin  Rudd seem to be more interested in the Indonesian view than the Australian  people’s view and the Coalition will put in place a mandate if we get one to put the  border policies in place that they have confirmed.

KELLY:  Just one final question on this point - in terms of taking more interest of the  Indonesian view than the Australian view - the Indonesian view as expressed by Dr  Natalegawa yesterday was that their position does not qualify Australia from acting in  its own national interest. He says ‘the task for us to ensure that those national efforts  are in sync or in synergy with bilateral and regional efforts so that we don’t cancel  one another out.’ Would you agree with that?

MORRISON:

Well of course and that is why we think taking sugar off the table in the form of Kevin  Rudd’s soft touch policies - and in fact he has no policy now. There is no policy from

the government. Senator Carr said there is one in the pipeline. Well it must be a  pretty long pipeline. It has been six years they have been in government. The only  thing that is in the pipeline is more boats under Kevin Rudd.

KELLY:

The government says I think we are expecting some kind of new policy or review  from the government announced later this week. Kevin Rudd was in PNG yesterday  discussing asylum seekers amongst other things. It is understood officials have been  talking for months now about opening another asylum seeker centre alongside Port  Moresby’s international airport. Would that be something, a move that a Coalition  Government in the future would support financially and practically?

MORRISON:

Well we have always supported the idea of offshore processing. We came up with  the idea. In fact it was Malcolm Fraser who originally implemented those policies  many, many years ago and under John Howard again. So offshore processing is part  of our platform and expanding the capacity of that is something we have always  been supportive of.

KELLY:

Scott Morrison, thank you very much for joining us on breakfast.

MORRISON:

Thank you Fran.
