TONY ABBOTT:

It’s exporting, it’s employing, it’s investing. This is a great business and we want to see more businesses like this here in  Tasmania and right around Australia. It’s imperative that we do everything we humanly can to grow a stronger economy. That’s

why my message to the Australian people starts with that. We will build a stronger economy so that everyone can get ahead. We  will abolish the carbon tax, we'll get the Budget back under control, we will build the roads of the 21st Century and we will stop the

boats. That is what I am offering the Australian people should we win the election on September the 7th.

We've just had today unemployment figures come out and obviously those figures confirm that unemployment in Tasmania is  about 2.5 percentage points higher than elsewhere in Australia. We have to get unemployment down everywhere, but we

particularly have to get unemployment down here in Tasmania.

I am confident that the Coalition's economic plan can produce one million new jobs in five years, 2 million new jobs in a decade,  by reproducing the kind of jobs growth that we had under the former Coalition Government. At the heart of our economic plan,

abolish the carbon tax, abolish the mining tax, get productivity up. If we get taxes down, if we get productivity up, we get economic  growth up. That means more prosperity and that means more jobs.

Next week I will be announcing the Coalition's growth plan for Tasmania. I have been in regular discussion with my friend and

State Parliamentary colleague Will Hodgman about the growth plan for Tasmania. I've been in regular discussion with our  senators and candidates here in Tasmania about the growth plan. Brett Whiteley obviously is part of those discussions because

the people of Tasmania need Members of Parliament who are committed to economic growth. Tasmania needs to be an  economy, as well as a national park. We have to use our forests, we have to use them wisely and well for the greater prosperity of

the Tasmanian people.

We need to use our oceans wisely and well for the greater prosperity of the Tasmanian people and for the welfare of the wider  world because we should be a food bowl for Asia in particular. So we will have a jobs growth plan for Tasmania. It will build on

what we've already announced for Tasmania - an upgraded Midland Highway, basing all Australia's Antarctic operations here in  Tasmania, fully protecting Tasmania's GST and other funds from the Commonwealth, fully protecting the freight equalisation

scheme, but ensuring that Commonwealth money that's coming to Tasmania is coming to build industries up, not close them  down. That's what Brett Whiteley is committed to. He has got the political skills as a former member of the State Parliament, as a

former local councillor, someone who is deeply embedded in the local community, he has got the political skills to do this.

Today I'm pleased to announce the first installment of our growth plan for Tasmania, and that's a new scheme to try to ensure that  Tasmania's long-term unemployed have a fair go at getting jobs. If you are a Tasmanian resident, if you have been unemployed

and on benefits for six months, if an employer takes you on and keeps you on for six months, for the following six months, the  employer will be paid $250 a fortnight.

So this is a boost for business, it is a boost for employment, it's a scheme which is special to Tasmania, special to Tasmania,

because we need to make a special effort here in Tasmania to build the Tasmanian economy, recognising Tasmania's special  circumstances in particular the fact that its unemployment is 2.5 percentage points above the national average.

So, if you want Tasmania to flourish, if you want to unlock the potential in the creativity of the great people of Tasmania, we've got

to get rid of Labor/Green Governments, wherever they are, we've got to get rid of the Labor/Green Government in Canberra on  September the 7th and then as soon as we can, we've got to get rid of the Labor/Green Government in Hobart.

That's why I'm so pleased to be with Will Hodgman, my friend and colleague and I would ask him to add to my remarks.

WILL HODGMAN:

Thank you very much Tony, for again being here in Tasmania and your ongoing interest in seeing this wonderful State achieve its  full potential. I'm delighted to be here at this iconic Tasmanian business and with my good friend and colleague Brett Whiteley, I

have had the privilege of working alongside Brett for eight years in the Tasmanian Parliament and I know he is just the thing that  this State needs and the people of Braddon need in Canberra, so I wish him all the best in this campaign.

This announcement today is the first installment in the Coalition's plan for growth in Tasmania and I'm delighted to have worked

closely with Tony on that plan. We've always said that Tasmania's economy is in desperate need of a kick-start and this is the sort  of initiative that is going to do just that. We now have an unemployment rate that is tragically well above the national average.

We've gone from a jobs crisis to a jobs catastrophe.

The Premier Lara Giddings has run out of ideas, by her own admission. This is a Government that has run out of steam. What  Tasmania needs, what our economy needs is a plan and we have a state plan for Tasmania and it’s all about boosting our

economy and we are working closely alongside our federal colleagues to boost Tasmania’s economy at a national level, so I’m  delighted to be a part of this announcement today.

TONY ABBOTT:

Ok, Brett, you might like to add to the announcement?

BRETT WHITELEY:

It's great to have Tony and Will - good to see you, Will - here in Braddon at this iconic industry, Petuna Seafoods, what a great

story in our region. For the people listening nationally now to this, there are so many good stories about Tasmania, we want you to  invest here, we need you to invest here but we understand that for the last 10, 13 years it has been really, really difficult to invest

here because of the hurdles that have been put up by Labor and more recently Labor-Green government.

So, I just want to put the message out that we want your investment, we welcome it, and today's announcement by Tony and the  hopefully the future Coalition government, to give that little kick start with a small subsidy for employers. To really help those who

have been locked into long-term unemployment, I think it is terrific Tony, so thank you for that.

I just want to say to Tony all the best on September 7th and we're really keen to see change in this part of Australia.

TONY ABBOTT:

Thanks so much Brett.

Ok, do we have any questions?

QUESTION:

How many of the one million jobs that you've pledged over the first five years will be here in Tasmania?

TONY ABBOTT:

I want to get unemployment in Tasmania back down towards the national average. Under the Howard Government, that was  pretty well achieved and I think if we have a good government in Canberra, we can do it again.

QUESTION:

How will the subsidies be funded?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, this particular scheme is costed and capped. It's a pilot scheme. It is special for Tasmania. It's on top of all of the existing

assistance for unemployed people, including additional assistance that the Coalition may announce later in the campaign more  generally. It's been costed at $6.5 million.

QUESTION:

Page 2 of 6 Doorstop Interview, Devonport, Tasmania > Tony Abbott

11/11/2013 http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/22487/20130903-0148/www.tonyabbott.c...

[Inaudible] said earlier today that you would introduce a special economic zone for Tasmania. Is this part of this particular plan or  is that something further down the track?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I know that there are some circumstances in which that is a term of art. What I'm talking about is a special effort recognising

Tasmania's special circumstances to ensure that we have a much stronger economy here in the future than we've had in the  recent past. As I keep saying, Tasmania has got to be a strong economy, as well as a beautiful national park.

QUESTION:

Just to clarify, Mr Abbott, you don't mean special economic zone in the formal economic sense?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I want Tasmania to be a place where people can invest, can employ, can create and grow a lot more easily than they can

right now, and under the Coalition, there will be no carbon tax, there will be a lot less regulation, there will be no mining tax, we'll  have the industrial relations pendulum back in the sensible centre, but we are announcing some special projects for Tasmania.

There will be some special projects right around Australia, there will be a growth package for Tasmania and the first installment is  being announced today.

QUESTION:

Will your special economic zone include business tax concessions and other incentives to drive investment that are, say, flagged

in Gina Rinehart's special economic zone in Northern Australia, and on your jobs plan announced today, Petuna once received a  federal and State Government grant of around $900,000, I believe, to facilitate around 50 jobs. How many jobs do you estimate to

be created by your announcement today?

TONY ABBOTT:

I'm hoping that 2,000 job also be created by the programme that is what I am hoping. I am hoping that 2,000 jobs will be created  by the programme hat I announce today. When I say that I want to put a special effort into boosting Tasmania's economy, it's got

nothing to do with anything that might have been proposed for northern Australia.

QUESTION:

You used the phrase "special economic zone", was that misleading now that you're announcing that is has nothing to do with  those that by definition [inaudible]?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think it is very important to make a special effort for Tasmania and what I have done today it is very important that we make a

special effort for Tasmania because Tasmania has been shamefully neglected for far too long. For far too long Labor-Green  governments in Hobart and more recently Labor-Green governments in Canberra have been trying to close industries down, not

boost them and keep them going.

That's why we will have a growth plan for Tasmania, and the first installment I announce today.

QUESTION:

Will this growth plan include any changes to industrial relations laws?

TONY ABBOTT:

No. We have announced our workplace relations policy, and what we have announced we will do and no more and no less.

QUESTION:

[inaudible] people aren't dumped after six months are being employed?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, one of the reasons why they have to be employed for six months before the money to the employer kicks in is because we

Page 3 of 6 Doorstop Interview, Devonport, Tasmania > Tony Abbott

11/11/2013 http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/22487/20130903-0148/www.tonyabbott.c...

don't want them just to be taken on and dumped once the subsidy ends. That's why we've said you've got to employ them for six  months before the subsidy starts and then the subsidy will continue for another six months. By the someone has been employed

for 12 months, by that stage they're fully trained, they’re normally part of the part of the team in the particular business, and we  think this is the best way of ensuring that the longer-term unemployed become longer-term employed.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, you've said this scheme is special for Tasmania, but is it something you would consider rolling out in other states

particularly those whose economies are struggling?

TONY ABBOTT:

Let's see how it goes here in Tasmania, and if it goes as well as I hope, obviously I would be prepared to consider rolling it out  elsewhere because while there is a cost  - $6.5 million - obviously the more people you can get off the welfare rolls and into the

employment rolls the better in the long term for everything - better for our prosperity, better for those individuals, better for their  families, better for their communities and of course ultimately better for government revenue.

QUESTION:

Just on the GST, you talk about protecting Tasmania's share of the GST, does that mean there is no hope for Colin Barnett

having a floor put on the payments and the formula? Secondly, on GST, talking about how you've got no intention to change it in  terms of the distribution rate, why even have it as part of an option on the table as part of your consultation pay, why not disregard

it as in the Henry review?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, Labor is gearing up for yet another scare campaign, yet another series of Labor lies on this. I just want to say to you the  only political party that will be putting taxes up after the election is the Australian Labor Party. Don't give them that chance.

QUESTION:

Why is the scheme only capped at 2,000 people

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, we want to see how it goes, and as I said, if we can swiftly get 2,000 people off long-term unemployment and into

employment, of course, of course we can expand it, but at the moment we want to start it up, we want to see how it goes. If it  succeeds, yes it will expand, but we've got to see how it goes first.

QUESTION:

Where will the $6 million come from?

TONY ABBOTT:

I want to make two points: First of all, our full list of saves and spends will be out there for the public to consider in good time

before the election. The full list of saves and spends will be there for the public consider in good time before the election, and the  Budget bottom line will be better under the Coalition than under the Labor Party. That's the first point I want to make. The second

point I want to make is that prior to this election campaign, in my Budget reply and in my National Press Club speech in January, I  outlined a series of significant savings that the Coalition would implement, adding up to over $17 billion. Now, $6.5 million is a

very small amount of money compared to those savings and the $6.5 million will be fully found from saves.

QUESTION:

On asylum seekers, there are authorities, non-partisan authorities who are saying that there is evidence out of Indonesia that  around 3000 people are delaying their trips on boats. Is it now time to stop talking about the PNG Solution as a failure?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, look, we can speculate endlessly about the future, but the facts are that thanks to Mr Rudd's misjudgment back in 2008,

we've had more than 50,000 illegal arrivals by boat, we've had almost 800 illegal boats, we've had $11 billion now in border  protection blow-outs and tragically we've had more than a thousand deaths at sea. The proposition that the man who started this

is ever going to be able to stop it, the man who lacked the will, who lacked the wit, if you like, to stick with something that was

Page 4 of 6 Doorstop Interview, Devonport, Tasmania > Tony Abbott

11/11/2013 http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/22487/20130903-0148/www.tonyabbott.c...

working because he wasn't man enough to leave well enough alone, the idea that he can now fix this problem, I just think beggars  belief.

QUESTION:

Will you not concede that under the PNG Solution, according to authorities, according to Australian intelligence which is bipartisan

and objective, the boats do seem to be slowing?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, the boats have got to be stopped. The boats have got to be stopped and thanks to Mr Rudd's policies, there is a huge  pipeline of potential illegal arrivals, and if you want to stop the boats, it's not enough to rely on other countries to do it for you.

You've got to put the right policies in place here in Australia and also on our borders, in the waters to our north. That means  temporary protection visas, it means rigorous offshore processing in places like Nauru and PNG. It means better cooperation with

source and transit countries and above all else it means the willingness to turn boats around where it is safe to do so. That's why  on day one of an incoming Coalition government, Operation Sovereign Borders will begin.

QUESTION:

You don't think it's working then [inaudible] your answer?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, look, how can anything be working if it has produced 50,000-plus illegal arrivals by boat?

QUESTION:

[Inaudible] in two weeks?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, as I said, there is a pipeline, so we're advised of some 10,000 would-be illegal boat arrivals and the idea that the person who

created this problem has suddenly, magically solved it, the idea that Mr Rudd can just somehow absolve himself of his culpability  and responsibility for this will never wash with the Australian people. The Australian people have been conned before by Mr Rudd,

they are not going to be conned again.

QUESTION:

On the issue of Peter Beattie, you say that Kevin Rudd has a lot to be worried about here, not you, so you're effectively conceding  that you will not have a contest in that seat anymore and Labor is going to win it?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, I think that the obvious conclusion is that the Labor Party knows what the Coalition knows - Mr Rudd has not been the

electoral wonder-worker in Queensland that they thought he might be, and that's why they're now calling on Peter Beattie to the  rescue. Well, again, the Australian public are not fools. They're not going to buy Kevin Rudd's tricks twice and they're not going to

buy Peter Beattie's tricks again, because let's face it, he was a flim-flam man who saddled people with record debt and deficit.  Yes, he means further leadership instability for the Labor Party if he gets elected, but I am very confident that what the people of

Forde want is someone who is going to work for them, and not just work for himself.

QUESTION:

Just on the 2,000 jobs, you say you want to create these swiftly. Is that a first-term commitment? And also you say you've already  announced $17 billion worth of savings, you've said that a lot over the past few days and made some significant announcements.

That $17 billion is not going to last forever, so when are we going to hear about some savings?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, it is a perfectly reasonable question, Laura, and I know that it's something that the public are entitled to ask as well. Once  PEFO is down, once we have the vast majority of our policies out there, we will announce further savings, we will.

QUESTION:

11/11/2013 http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/22487/20130903-0148/www.tonyabbott.c...

[Inaudible]

TONY ABBOTT:

I'm not going to put a time line on it but in good time before the election, we will be announcing further savings because the public  understand in a way that Kevin Rudd just doesn't, that governments like businesses and like households, have to live within their

means. The public understand that. They know that the spend-a-thon Mr Rudd's reckless spend-a-thon just can't continue and  that's why I say you will know exactly what we're saving, you will know exactly what we're spending, you will know exactly how

much our budget position is better than the Labor Party's in good time before the next election, and as for the 2,000 jobs, yes, we  believe that they will eventuate in the first term of a Coalition government.

Thank you so much.
