Carbon Tax Chaos

Labor’s Carbon Tax is in chaos with the revelation that the supposed 500 companies to be taxed

may now be 400.

Prime Minister Julia Gillard originally said 1,000 companies would pay the Carbon Tax.

Then it became 500, with Minister Combet as recently as last week refusing to again provide a

definitive list, telling businesses to work it out for themselves.

Now the Climate Change Department has let the cat out of the bag Ã¢ÂÂ that the figure could be 400.

Prime Minister Gillard Ã¢ÂÂ what really is the number and how can anyone have confidence in the

Carbon Tax amid this chaos?

This is just another indication that Labor is incompetent when it comes to implementing policies.

We’ve seen it with pink batts, the BER, asylum seekers and now the Carbon Tax.

While the Labor Government is confused on the figures, there is one thing that is certain, it will be

everyday families and businesses who will end up paying for this Carbon Tax.

They will pay it through their power prices, grocery prices and council rates.

How can anyone trust Labor’s promise of compensation when they can’t work out which companies

are going to be affected?

Such uncertainty is the last thing business needs in the current economic climate. Prime Minister

Gillard should dump the tax immediately and stand by her original promises Ã¢ÂÂ ‘there will be no

Carbon Tax under the government I lead.’
