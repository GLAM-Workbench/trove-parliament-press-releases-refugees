E & OE

Subjects: Nielsen poll, royal commission, drought, Manus Island disturbance, Australia-Indonesia  relations, National Disability Insurance Scheme

GILBERT:

With us now on the program we’ve got Liberal frontbencher Mitch Fifield and Labor frontbencher Michelle  Rowland.  You must be pleased Senator Fifield to see those numbers [Nielsen poll] come back - I know  we’re a long way out in terms of the electoral cycle but encouraging to see that your message is being  heard?

FIFIELD:

Well Keiran, we don’t want to be in the business of being commentators on the polls. But I think, suffice to  say there was a general election not long ago. There was a very strong result for the Coalition. There was a  clear mandate for our policies. And as Manager of Government Business in the Senate, I think there’s a  message here for the Australian Labor Party. And that is ‘get out of the way’. Let us repeal the carbon tax.  Let us repeal the mining tax. That’s what the people voted for.

GILBERT:

Well, overwhelmingly good news for the Coalition. You heard what John Stirton had to say there at the end,  about Tony Abbott personally. Is that just the legacy of being around for so long, he is such a known  quantity?

FIFIELD:

Well Kieran, Tony Abbott has been someone who has never had an eye to the poll. He’s someone who  has set out an agenda for the benefit of the Australian people. He’s going to do what’s right and that’s what  he’s focussed on.

GILBERT:

Michelle Rowland, nearly 70 per cent of the people surveyed in this poll, 1400 individuals surveyed, 67 per  cent support the idea of a royal commission into the unions. Did Bill Shorten get it wrong on this one?





ROWLAND:

I think Bill Shorten’s been very clear and Labor’s been very consistent about what we think should be  happening in this area. If the Government wishes to take action, and that is, that if we have such a problem  with corruption, then we should refer it to the highest body possible, rather than have a royal commission  which will take an extended period of time. But also I think we need to look at things like the cost of this, but  also in previous royal commissions, whether we have actually had prosecutions and results and I think that  Bill Shorten’s been very clear about this.  I also think that if Mitch and the Liberal Party want to gloat about  these results, be my guest.  Be my guest because nothing pleases me more than to see a government…

FIFIELD:

No gloating.

ROWLAND:

… in hubris, seeing a government that is arrogant and out of touch and I’ll tell you what figures really matter  Kieran, and that is the number of jobless people that have been left under this Government in barely five  months.

GILBERT:

What about Shorten’s approval though? It’s down 11 points in only a couple of months - you might be  encouraged by what he’s saying, but it doesn’t seem a lot of people - a lot of people in the electorate - agree with you.

ROWLAND:

Bill Shorten’s barely been Labor Leader for five months, I mean we had a time there when we went through  our own processes of selecting the leader and I think that Bill in a very short period of time has managed to  be someone whom the public has gotten to know, he’s worked very hard on that.  He campaigned  personally very hard in Griffith, a seat which the pundits actually said Labor was going to lose. He  campaigned very hard there and very effectively and I think as time goes on, as Labor lets the public know  and develops our policies in key areas of reform, I think that people will come to understand that they can  have something better than a Liberal Government which breaks so many promises in less than five months.

GILBERT:

Mitch Fifield, to the drought tour the Prime Minister is conducting at the moment.  Obviously, we saw those  pictures yesterday, remarkable rainfall, the first for many many months, there was one child who’d never  seen it before, at one of the properties Tony Abbott had visited. But pictures are fine, it’s going to be the  dollars that count.  At a time when you’re trying to save and cut spending, will enough be provided here for  what is - I think both sides of politics agree - a much needed boost to drought assistance?



FIFIELD:

Well Kieran, you know I think you’ve seen and the Australian people have seen that Barnaby Joyce and the  Prime Minister, they don’t carry lightly the issues that are facing Australians on the land.  What we need to  have is a fair and a responsible package.  Australians are very generous people and Australians, I think,  often do have those on the land in their minds when times are tough. So Cabinet will look at the issue and  they will come forward with a plan that’s fair and that’s also responsible.







GILBERT:

And what about the sustainability issue? I know that Tony Abbott among others has referred to this in terms  of properties receiving the assistance and farmers receiving the assistance, about making sure that these  are on a sustainable footing into the future.  Is that something that the Cabinet is very much cognisant of?

FIFIELD:

Look, Cabinet wants to do what it can to help.  Australians on the land, they don’t want welfare, they want  support to help them get back on their feet and I think that’s what will frame the discussions of the Cabinet.

GILBERT:

And there is bipartisan support for this, isn’t there, Michelle Rowland, in terms of drought assistance? In  fact, Bill Shorten saying that he would have preferred it to be done sooner.  Doesn’t it make sense though  for Tony Abbott to go there, take some soundings from people first?

ROWLAND:

It’s one thing to do a tour of drought affected areas, but I think the reality is that we all know that this is a  dire situation and we had an opportunity in the Parliament last week to actually bring forward some  legislation on this matter, but we had a ridiculous situation where the Government actually ran out of  legislation to be debated. We should have brought it on then. I’ll also make the point Kieran, that we’ve had  cuts to the farm finance scheme already, $40 million worth of cuts in that area. Actions do speak louder  than words and I am sure that the people on that land who are being affected would agree with me.

GILBERT:

We’ve got to go to a break, and we’ll be right back with Michelle Rowland and Senator Mitch Fifield. Stay  with us.

BREAK

Now to the Manus Island disturbance that we’ve seen last night, late yesterday. Mitch Fifield, as I read the  statement from Scott Morrison earlier in the piece, a number of asylum seekers, transferees have received  medical treatment. According to the reports he’s received, PNG police have made some arrests.  Is this  sort of tension inevitable given the group of people, 1000 plus, know what’s in store for them now?

FIFIELD:

Well, it’s not entirely clear at this stage what has happened. We do know that there was a disturbance  overnight. We do know that there are reports of some transferees having received medical attention, there  are some reports of transferees having been arrested. But the Department of Immigration will confirm what  the situation was when they get further detail.

GILBERT:

Is this, though, inevitable collateral damage almost for a policy which is hard line? We had the PM again  reiterate that at the start of the program in that comment on the ABC.  He’s been on 2GB again this  morning making the same point, that if people come here illegally, that that is what they can expect to be  faced with; immigration detention.

FIFIELD:

We make no apology for being resolute. We make no apology for offshore processing. I just wish that the  former government had come around to it sooner. You might recall, Kieran, that they spent three or four





years - or longer - saying offshore processing was essentially immoral. In the end, reality hit them in the  face and even they had to come on board with offshore processing. But we don’t apologise for being firm.  We don’t apologise for making it clear to the people smugglers that we’re going to put them out of business.

GILBERT:

Michelle Rowland, no successful boat arrival in eight weeks now.  It shows that that hard line, that  deterrence, is working, doesn’t it?

ROWLAND:

The policy agenda that was put in place by Labor in July of last year has been the single biggest circuit  breaker.  I think the statistics have also shown that the biggest decline actually came immediately after  Labor implemented this policy, so Labor is as pleased as anyone that the Government is continuing to  have, as a central policy platform, the central part of this which is working, which is the offshore processing  scheme that Labor put in place.

GILBERT:

In terms of this Manus Island disturbance though, I’ll put the same question that I put to Senator Fifield.  Is  that sort of thing inevitable, given the tough circumstances and also given the knowledge that the  individuals concerned won’t ever make it to Australia and will be resettled if they’re lucky in PNG?

ROWLAND:

One would hope that it’s not inevitable, because we as Labor want to see the flow of boats stopped and we  are pleased to see that this policy is working. And if we have a situation where the things like the  advertisements, the publicity scheme, offshore is actually having a deterrent effect, as well as the people  smuggler’s business model being broken as a result of that then Labor wants to see that happen more than  anyone. So we are pleased to see that the policy settings are working, one would hope that it’s not an  inevitability that these kinds of things occur and as Richard Marles, the Opposition spokesperson said this  morning, it is not an easy job administering these offshore arrangements.

GILBERT:

Marty Natalegawa, the Indonesian Foreign Minister, Senator Fifield - he will be raising his concerns about  Australian border protection policies with the US Secretary of State, which shows that while some are  pleased, Labor’s pleased that the boat arrivals have stopped, certainly the Indonesians aren’t too happy  with the way you’re going about it, i.e., with the lifeboats and the turnbacks.

FIFIELD:

Well, we’ve always been upfront with the Indonesian Government about our determination to stop the  people smuggling trade.  We are putting in place the policies that we said we would.  Obviously, Indonesia  and the United States can discuss whatever issues they like. So we’re very comfortable with that. But we’re  going to continue to pursue the policies that are working.

GILBERT:

If he’s going to be taking it up with the US Secretary of State, this Jakarta focussed foreign policy that the  Prime Minister had wanted isn’t going too well is it, right now?  That is just one victim of that tough line, that  the boats might be stopping, but the relations with Indonesia, with Jakarta are not going so well.









FIFIELD:

I think you’ve got to look at the entirety of the bilateral relationship and I heard Julie Bishop just the other  day saying that she talks to the Indonesian Foreign Minister on just about a daily basis. So the lines of  communication are there, they are open. We are talking to our partners in Indonesia and we’re going to  continue to pursue the policies that look like they’re being extremely effective.

GILBERT:

Michelle, the Prime Minister says he’s thrilled that Indonesia and the US can have a candid discussion on  Australian immigration policies. He’s certainly not worried about it.

ROWLAND:

Kieran, you’ve highlighted the significant difference between the policy implementation under Labor and  under this Government.  What a sorry state of affairs it is that we have our nearest neighbour, such an  important country in our area, particularly important to our successful policies in this area, actually calling  on Washington to have to deal with Australia.  It is a sorry state of affairs when we have reached such a  level, when that has to occur. And this kind of low point in the relationship didn’t happen under Labor, did  not happen under Labor. And how many times did I sit here on your program and many others, and get  lectured by then members of the opposition about how Labor had destroyed the relationship with Indonesia,  how the Liberals were going to make it so much better. Well we see the proof here and now. And we have  plumbed to such depths that we have Marty Natalegawa calling on John Kerry to assist with relations with  Australia.

GILBERT:

I know what Senator Fifield was going to say about the live cattle trade…

FIFIELD:

Took the words right out of my mouth.

GILBERT:

…but I want to move on from there because I think we’ve discussed this issue enough in terms of border  protection. I do want to ask you though on this issue on the spying front. Because this is something both  sides of politics have to accept accountability for, because it happened under the Gillard Government. This  latest leak from Snowden reported in the New York Times - that Australia assisted a US law firm  representing Indonesia, that Australian intelligence agencies gathered intelligence against this law firm  representing Indonesia in a trade dispute in the US. It just seems that it goes into every facet of the  relationship, doesn’t it? Even the economic relationship being monitored?

FIFIELD:

Kieran it’s the practice of all Australian governments not to comment on intelligence matters, and I’m sure  Michelle would agree with that. But the Australian Government - regardless of who is in office - the  information that it gathers from its intelligence sources is not used to the detriment of other nations. So we  are fortunate that we do have very robust accountability mechanisms for our intelligence agencies, and I  think the Australian people can have confidence in that.

GILBERT:

Michelle Rowland, finally on that issue. Do you accept that explanation from the Government?







ROWLAND:

Look I’m not privy to the details of this matter, and certainly it is the practice of both governments and  oppositions to not comment on national security matters.

I think that it’s very important for the Opposition to receive a briefing on this matter, which is what’s been  requested. And my understanding is that that has been granted. But I think at the end of this it’s very  important to recognise that Australia’s relationship with Indonesia under this government has certainly not  been the good relationship that it was under Labor.

GILBERT:

And Senator Fifield, finally, you’re the Minister responsible for the National Disability Insurance Scheme.  Four trial sites are being rolled out. Tell me, what’s the latest in terms of cost? My understanding is that  they have fallen away a bit, that they are looking a bit better in terms of the forecasts?

FIFIELD:

The first quarter of the trial sites found that average package costs were about 30% higher than was  anticipated. In the second quarter, they’re down to about 15% above what was anticipated. Now you’ve to  be careful not to extrapolate to the full scheme rollout, the quarterly results, because some people receive  supports on a one-off basis, others on a year-in year-out basis. But it’s important still to keep a weather eye  on the sustainability of the scheme early on.

The other thing that we’ve found is that there were some errors in the bilateral agreements negotiated by  the previous Government. So it looks like there could be additional costs of about $392 million over the  launch phase of the scheme.

GILBERT:

But the Coalition is 100% committed to rolling the NDIS out in full, even despite those cost overruns?

FIFIELD:

Absolutely. And those areas in the bilaterals, although they apply to the trial sites, those particular things  have been factored into the full scheme cost.

GILBERT:

We’re almost out of time, but just finally, in terms of the early trial sites, is it true that those most profoundly  disabled are involved in those trial sites, therefore the costs inherently will be more?

FIFIELD:

Look, there could be some unique factors to do with the characteristics of individuals who are coming in to  the trial sites initially. And that’s part of what we’re going to be doing, is looking at distilling those numbers  to find out the reasons why.

GILBERT:

Senator Fifield, thanks so much for that.
