AUSTRALIA AND THE UNITED STATES

Address by Senator Gareth Evans, Minister for Foreign

Affairs and Trade, to the Queensland Branch of the

Australian Institute of International Affairs and the

State Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Brisbane, 19 May

1989.

Since assuming the Foreign Affairs and Trade portfolio, I

have not given a major speech in Australia on Australia's

relations with the United States.  I thought it was time

to do so because it is a relationship, both in reality

and in public perception, which looms exceedingly large

in our foreign affairs and trade thinking.  My recent

visit to Washington, the attention that Australia-United

States trade problems received in the aftermath of Vice

President Quayle's visit, and the publicity given to the

ANZUS question by the Yale University speech of the New

Zealand Prime Minister, all make it timely to offer an

analysis of Australia-United States relations, and of the

policy and perceptions behind those relations.

I want today to explore the dynamics of the relationship

between Australia and the United States: the mutual

interests that the alliance serves, the role of American

leadership and the capacity of the alliance to

accommodate differences in perceptions and actions.

At a time when some commentators are questioning where

the balance of advantage lies, I want to look closely at

the ledger of benefits, and to explain how a range of

Australian interests, going well beyond matters of

security, are served by a close but independent

relationship with a country which remains the leading

influence on the international scene.

I do not want to understate the serious trade related

differences Australia has with the United States. But it

is worth reminding ourselves, on occasions when the

Australia-US relationship is under public scrutiny, that

it is normal in international relations for differences

to exist, even between close allies. It is not normal,  indeed it is abnormal, for relations between any two

states to be so devoid of differences, as to be completely

ripple-free. It suggests either that they have nothing

vital in common or that one has an unhealthy influence

over the other.

A reminder is especially appropriate at the moment

because in the 1930s, before the war-time alliance

between our two countries, there was constant friction

over economic issues - Australia's large adverse trade

balance with the US; Washington's tariff policies;

Australian objections to Pan American's landing rights

here; and the cost of cabling facilities between

Australia and North America. So much so that the

American Consul-General in Sydney reported in 1935 that

"anti-American feeling is fairly rife".

As economic issues have risen in the agenda of the 1980s,

public awareness of friction between Australia and the  i  United Stiates has also risen. For Australians born and

raised among high and solemn policy utterances about the

alliance with the United States, there may be concern

that the relationship is somehow weaker as a result. I

want today to show that this is not the case, but at the

same time make clear that the relationship with the

United States - though of particular importance - is not

something different in essence from other international

relationships, etherealised in some way above the

atmosphere of ordinary life. It has to be assessed like

any other relationship. It has to be managed.  And, from

time to time, it has to be tested.

Similarities and differences.  It has been a strength and

a weakness of Australian attitudes to the United States

that we see ourselves as so similar: both democracies;

both beneficiaries of the English language; both

inheritors of the rule of law, a free press and a strong

private sector; both a part of what used to be called

the New World.

Yet just as George Bernard Shaw described Britain and the

United States as separated by the same language, the

broad similarities between Australians and Americans mask

striking institutional and cultural differences.  The

strong role of government in Australia followed

necessarily from our beginnings as a penal settlement.

In America the early settlers were disparate,

self-reliant communities more likely to be governed, if

at all, by commercial enterprise or religious

conviction. While we still have an hereditary British

monarch as our head of state, the Americans broke with

their British colonial masters in a revolutionary war.

We evolved slowly as a nation state; some might say too

slowly, through self-government, dominion status Â·  and

finally independence.

The major difference, however, is simply historical. The

United States is an established society which for about

half this century has been the world's greatest power.

Australia is, by comparison, a small nation with an

evolving sense of its place in the world; a nation for

which the American model of the way to wealth and power

may not so readily apply.

The important question is not why or how these

differences exist but how can they be successfully

managed. Each country needs to make the effort to

understand the other and not just assume that we are

natural allies.  The nature of the effort required of

each side itself differs in important ways. For

Â«9 3 a

.4 .

Australians, it means at the very least penetrating the

global avalanche of simplistic popular images of American

culture to come to grips with the real flesh and blood -

the human complexities and competitive pressures which

make the American polity such a vigorous and fertile

one. For Americans,  nurtured on a profound belief in the

intrinsic and unique virtues of American society and in

America's democracy - a belief for which history has in

this century given them plenty of reinforcement - it

calls for an often difficult leap of imagination to

understand, simply, what it is to be a non-American, and

to accept wholeheartedly the legitimacy of non-American

interests and the value of friends who are true to

themselves.

There is a place in this process for more cultural and

people-to-people links - the huge increase in tourist

flows over the last few years is a step in the right

direction - because for all the shared cultural symbols,

there are still huge gaps in our knowledge of each

other's society.

The alliance has experienced the highs and lows of

diplomacy. Perhaps the lowest was, instructively, the

misconstrued effect of a high: the late Harold Holt's

well-intdntioned, yet exultant cry: "All the way with

LBJ", which suggested to Australians grappling with the

trauma of the military commitment in Vietnam that the

Australian Prime Minister had lost sight of their way.

The highs in alliance diplomacy, as distinct from

war-time camaraderie, have included the creation of

sensible understandings with the United States during the

period of Indonesia's "confrontation" with Malaysia -

when major regional conflict seemed imminent - and, more

recently, Australia's role in maintaining links with both

New Zealand and the Unites States during the still

evolving ANZUS dispute. In each case Australia was clear

sighted about its interests and subtle in pursuit of them.

. 5 .

The experience of both sides of Australian politics in

managing the alliance, after the politicising of ANZUS

during the 1950s and 1960s, has brought recently a

maturing of our relations with the United States.  We

have made clear, for some time now that we no longer seek

what used to be called a "special relationship" with the

United States, or with any other country, because in the

past that has been an excuse for not having an Australian

foreign policy. The desire for a "special relationship"

with any country is an invitation to laziness and lack of

integrity in policy making, removing as it tends to do

the perceived need for making the kind of hard-headed

assessments of national interests and capacities which

are essential to any credible foreign policy.

What Australia now has with the United States is not just

a military alliance, but a relationship of real depth and

breadth, embracing ties of history, commerce and culture,

and a profound mutual interest in maintaining a strong

American presence globally and within our region.

That the alliance gives expression to mutual interests

needs to be clearly understood because it lies at the

heart of its durability. These interests extend' across

security issues, economic issues and multilateral or

global issues, and it is worth looking at the ledger of

benefits in each of these areas in turn in order to

arrive at a balanced picture of what both sides gain from

the relationship.

Security benefits.  The ANZUS alliance does not absolve

Australia from its responsibility to pull its full weight

in its own protection. Australia's defence policy is one

of self-reliance. But it is self-reliance within an

alliance framework. The alliance, as the review of the

ANZUS Treaty which the Hawke Government initiated in 1983

concluded, continues to be a fundamental of Australia's

defence policy. Ã¢ÂÂ

. 6 .

It is fundamental because, quite apart from the

significant deterrent value associated with its ultimate

guarantee that each country will, in the event of armed

attack, "act to meet the common danger", the alliance

provides an ongoing framework for the exchange of

intelligence, technology, resupply and training. Without  these arrangements, Australia would find it difficult to

sustain a self-reliant defence posture. And, as Kim

Beazley has noted, such assistance, while vital to

Australia, is not costly, financially or politically, to

the United States.

The United States contribution to Australia's security

goes beyond bilateral defence cooperation. It also has a

regional dimension, because the contribution the United

States makes to regional security also bolsters

Australia's national security. While we have not always

agreed with every aspect of US policy in the region - not

least in relation to Vietnam - it must be acknowledged

that United States leadership has, in the post-War

period, been a vital ingredient in the economic growth

and relative strategic stability of the Asia-Pacific

region. It contributed hugely to the political and

economic renaissance of Japan. It supported the economic

development! and stability of other countries in the

region as they came to grips with independence, in some

cases with spectacular results.

Within the area of Australia's primary strategic

interest, the United States bases in the Philippines at

Subic Bay and Clark make an important contribution to

regional security, which is why Australia has expressed

its support for the retention of these facilities: their

presence or absence will be an important continuing

element in the regional equilibrium, not just in the

familiar US-Soviet context but in the multipolar

environment emerging with the rapid growth of other major

regional powers.

M 3  5

.7.

Similarly, the continuation of a healthy,

multi-dimensional relationship between the United States

and Japan is manifestly vital to the security and

progress of the whole Asia/Pacific region. Here, as

elsewhere in the region, we see the United States

presence as a generally stabilising one: a presence

which helps to ensure that the regional security

environment remains relatively benign from an Australian

perspective.

On the other side of the security ledger, important

United States interests are served by the alliance. Our

location makes us a strategically significant ally. Not

only are we currently the only formal US ally in the

South West Pacific but we are in the unique position of

straddling both the Indian and Pacific oceans where the

United States and, more generally, the Western alliance

have vital interests - although I might not go as far as

former US National Security Advisor Brzezinski who in a

speech in Melbourne last year rather thrillingly

described Australia as the "Oceanic Geo-Strategic Control

Centre" .

We -are important to the United States as an ally which is

recognised as a major power in the South Pacific, a

respected voice on Asian affairs and a major trading

partner in North and East Asia. In my experience United

States leaders genuinely value the perspective we bring

to regional issues.

We offer the United States access to our ports in both

oceans, access which is important in sustaining the US

global role. Again, our contributions to regional

security through our Defence Cooperation Program in South

East Asia and the South Pacific, our participation in the

Five Power. Defence Arrangements,  and our capability to

analyse regional developments, all serve important

alliance as well as specifically Australian interests.

. 8 .

If we did not do them, the United States would have to

devote even more resources to the region.

In the larger global context, we make a distinctive

contribution to the United States defence posture, and,

through that to global stability, by operating with the

United States a number of joint facilities in Australia,

most importantly at Pine Gap and Nurrungar.

The ground station at Nurrungar is used for controlling

satellites in the United States Defence Support Program,

which would give the earliest warning of a ballistic

missile attack on the United States or its allies. It

thus plays a key role in helping to deter a nuclear

attack and to prevent a nuclear exchange starting from an

accidental launch. The Pine Gap facility collects

intelligence data which supports the national security of

both Australia and the United States. In particular, it

provides data vital to the verification of arms control

and disarmament. The value of this compliance

verification role has become increasingly, evident as

disarmament has moved from being an aspiration to an

emerging reality with the INF Treaty and the real

prospect of a START Agreement. Without this verification

capacity, further major arms control agreements could

simply not be concluded; and without Australia's

contribution the risk of nuclear war would be directly

and significantly increased.

Commercial benefits.  In economic terms, the relationship

with the United States is, has long been, and will for

.  the foreseeable future continue to be a very important

one for Australia.

In the first half of the nineteenth century, before the

Panama canal was built and the railroads joined the east

and west coasts of the United States, it was easier to

ship goods to California from Sydney than from New York.

BB37

The trading ties of last century have grown into a

substantial commercial relationship.  The United States

is Australia's second largest trading partner, supplying

over 20 per cent of our imports and taking over 10 per

cent of our exports. The total stock of US investment in

Australia is higher than that of any country. And what

happens in the US economy of course directly affects the

health of the Australian economy, as it does that of a

great many other countries around the world.

Obviously the bilateral commercial relationship looms

larger for Australia than it does for the United States.

But this is not to say that the Australian market is not

important to the United States. Australia is the United

States' eleventh largest export market.  The United

States has a two to one trade balance in its favour with

Australia.  We are among the top four cash customers of

United States defence equipment. In the last four years

alone, we have spent $4.7 billion on defence purchases in

"  the United States. Australian investment in the United

States is high by any standards, and it is increasing.

At the end of 1986-87, it stood at $21 billion. In 1989,

Australia is likely to rank fourth in terms of foreign

merger and acquisition activity in the United States.

Multilateral benefits.  Beyond security and economic

matte'rs, the United States is important to Australia

because of the crucial influence it is able to exert

across a range of multilateral issues which are vital to

Australia's long term security and prosperity. Whether

it is the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade

negotiations, the effective operation of the United

Nations and its specialised agencies, multilateral

negotiations on a Chemical Weapons Convention and a

Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, or a host of other issues

in which Australia has a stake, it matters to Australia

what position the United States takes. .

. 9 .

. 10.

Appeals for support on multilateral issues work both

ways. Australia does not carry the same clout in

multilateral forums .  as a superpower, but we are

nevertheless a significant player. And on many

multilateral issues, the United States is keen to secure

Australian support because of our reputation as an

active, independent and influential participant on the

multilateral scene. Examples of issues on which the

United States has sought Australian support include human

rights resolutions, UN consideration of the future of

Micronesia, the question of Palestinian representation on

bodies ,like the World Health Organisation, international

efforts to strengthen the Nuclear Non-Proliferation

Treaty, and the negotiations in the Conference on

Disarmament on a chemical weapons convention. On the

last item, it is illustrative of my point that the United

States approached Australia with the suggestion that we

host the forthcoming international Government-Industry

Conference on Chemical Weapons.

The alliance relationship does not,  of course, of itself

guarantee United States support for Australian

objectives in multilateral negotiations. But the

alliance does give us access that we would not otherwise

enjoy. Without the alliance it would be that much harder

for a geographically remote, medium sized country to

secure and keep the attention of a superpower.  It has

been a constant complaint of other nations that United

States policy is driven too much by either East-West

perspectives, or else domestic imperatives. The alliance

relationship gives us the opportunity to inject a

different perspective; one that may otherwise get lost in

the big picture of United States foreign policy.

My purpose in going through this ledger of benefits -

across -the security, commercial and multilateral fields -

is not to make the case that the balance of benefits lies

with one or the other side. Precise measurements of that

6939

. 11.

sort are not only difficult but they are also fairly

meaningless.  The more important point, and the one that

goes to the heart of the question of the value of the

alliance, is that each side reaps important benefits from

the alliance. Simplistic assumptions that the alliance

is only about hypothetical security guarantees patently

ignore the range of Australian interests which the

Australia-United States relationship serves. Or to put

it another way, those who argue Australia should abandon

the alliance - or who urge the Government to make threats

which could lead to the destruction of the alliance -

need to explain why Australia should forego these

benefits, for little return, but at considerable cost to

Australian national interests.

Alliance and independence.  It is sometimes asserted that

an alliance between two nations of such unequal

capabilities as Australia and the United States

inevitably involves the surrender of foreign policy

independence by the smaller nation. Some past Australian

policies can be interpreted as supporting this

assessment. But the impression sometimes conveyed by

previous Australian Governments that they were unprepared

to exercise independent judgments does not mean that such

judgments are incompatible with a close alliance with the

United States. My own view, and the basic approach of

the Hawke Government, is that alliance does not mean -  I  Ã¢ÂÂ

and does not demand - obeisance.

Australia and the United States hold similar views on a

great many international political and security issues.

In recent years we have also had differences of view on

such significant issues as the Strategic Defence

Initiative, sanctions against South Africa, ratification

of the Geneva Protocol on the rules of war, some Middle

Eastern and Central American questions, aspects of the

South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty, and on the

urgency of a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. In citing

6940

. 12.

these examples I am not suggesting that the measure of

independence is the number of disagreements. The point

is that, whether or not we come out in agreement or in

disagreement with the United States on any particular

issue, we do so on the basis of an independent Australian

judgment. Our differences reflect differing national

interests and outlooks based upon such things as

geography, our respective roles in regional and global

politics, the composition of our exports and so on. A

healthy alliance, as ours most assuredly is, not only

accommodates independence but demands it. In this sense,

ours is not only an alliance of democracies but also a

democratic alliance.

Trade problems.  This is not to say that all differences

are healthy differences.  Some are not, and the serious

problems we face in the trade area with the United States

fall into this latter category.

Decisions made in Washington on such issues as the Export

Enhancement Program, sugar quotas and restrictions on

imports of meat and dairy products - all intended to

defend the interests of Americans - have in fact had the

effect of hurting Australians.  In particular Australia's

primary producers, who are among the most efficient in

the world, are finding themselves squeezed out of markets

by practices which distort prices and levels of

productibn.

)

Australia finds itself caught in the crossfire of a

destructive trans-Atlantic subsidies war. It is no

consolation to be told that the EC and not Australia is

the intended target. And we are even less impressed by

this line of argument when we see that the intended

target has not been hit but we and others in the Cairns

Group of fair traders in agriculture have been. The most

graphic example is wheat, where the increased pressure on

international markets and prices caused by the

6941

. 13 .

interaction of the US Export Enhancement Program with iis

cited target, the EC Common Agricultural Policy, has over

recent years forced efficient Australian farmers to

reduce considerably their production of wheat.

The irony is that the United States makes loud complaints

about the barriers its products face in certain export

markets.  Listening to the domestic debate on these

matters in the United States I gained the impression that

most Americans think that protectionism is something that

only happens outside the United States and that the

United States plays fair while no one else does. The

reality is quite different.  Indeed a recent article in

The Economist (reprinted in The Australian of 4 May 1989)

reported that the Reagan Administration - a self Styled

proponent of free trade - presided over the biggest

increase in American protectionism since Herbert Hoover’s

time. And by one estimate fully one quarter of imports

into America are affected by some form of protection - up  from one eighth in Hoover's day.

The trade problems between Australia and the United

States must be resolved because if they are not they will

eat away at the larger relationship. As the Prime

Minister said in a speech last June to a joint session of

the United States Congress: "Australians must not be

given reason to believe that while we are first class

allies, we are, in trade, second class friends. Trade

issues must not be allowed to fester, or to erode our

wider friendship or alliance".

On the trade issue, as with other issues, the Government

recognises the complex range of pressures with which

United States policy makers in the Administration and the

Congress must contend. But Australians also expect that

their ally will take account of their deeply felt

concerns.  It is an inevitable feature of the politics -

. 14.

and the psychology - of scale that all aspects of the

alliance tend to loom much larger in the Australian  consciousness than in the American consciousness.  This

means that careful management by both sides is essential

if we are to prevent these different perspectives from

becoming divergent perspectives.

There is an obligation on Australian policy makers to

ensure that American actions are seen by the Australian

community in their proper perspective.  But there is also

an obligation on United States policy makers to avoid

actions taken in terms of their global policies which

harm, however inadvertently, Australian interests.  We

understand that the United States must look out for its

own interests.  But it does the United States no good -

and its alliances no good - if, in pursuing its global

concerns, the United States is seen as giving little or

no weight to the welfare of its smaller friends and

allies.

In summary, the relationship between Australia and the

United States is today as relevant to the international

agenda and to the interests of each side as it was when

the ANZUS alliance was first concluded nearly forty years

ago.  i

It remains relevant because it has been flexible enough

to adapt- to changing circumstances. In particular, it

has adapted to the geo-strategic demands of a nuclear

world. It has adapted, after some trial and error, to

profound changes in the regional environment. And it is

adapting now to the demands of the economic agenda, as

evidenced in the fact that since 1986 trade and economic

issues have been an established part of the annual

Australia-United States Ministerial talks.

Â«943

. 15.

The relationship has not only adapted, it has matured.

Both sides of Australian politics have now had experience

of government and the temptation to exploit the alliance

as a political issue is no longer as attractive.

Bilaterally, each partner has today a sharper and a

deeper understanding of the benefits of the alliance and

of each other. The establishment of the joint facilities

and other developments in the years since ANZUS was

signed have heightened the perception that the alliance

relationship is a strong one and,' importantly, that it is

a balanced one. Â·

Australia regards a strong United States in global and

regional affairs as a fundamental ingredient of a

peaceful and prosperous world, a peaceful and prosperous

region, and a peaceful and prosperous Australia.

We hold this view, not as a sentimental impulse, but as a

response to the realities of world politics. A more

multipolar world is developing. In our region this

diversity will be especially marked, with Japan, China,

and India already playing distinctive roles.

The;Hawke Government does not shrink from this freeing up

of a bipolar world. We welcome it. We are confident

that Australia has the policies now, especially in

defence, foreign affairs and trade, to make a

I  -  Â·

contribution to peace and prosperity in this emerging

world.

But whether we are speaking of the central strategic

balance in a global sense, or of the regional equipoise

that is taking shape in our part of the world, we see a

United States presence - and a vigorous one at that - as

essential.

HIM 4

. 16.

American power, whether it is economic or military,

cannot be withdrawn in any substantial sense without

creating uncertainty and anxiety. American influence,

whether political or cultural, cannot be withdrawn

without a sense of loss. So far as I am aware, there is

no desire in the Asia-Pacific region for a diminished  American presence.  There is, on the contrary, general

support for the maintenance of an active and nuanced

United States engagement in the region.

We seek to continue our alliance with the United States

because it is in Australia's interest to do so. We will

also do our utmost to encourage the United States to

remain a powerful presence in our part of the world and a

powerful influence on world affairs generally.

We do this because the United States, despite its

occasional lapses into nationalism and protectionism, is

still the leading influence in an increasingly

interdependent modern world. We do it because the United

States,  whatever its shortcomings, remains the single

most potent force in the world for those values that have

provided the democratic core of the Australian experience

so far, and that :  remain at the core of our aspirations

for the future.
