SUBJECT:  INTEREST RATES; MRRT; DEATH OF AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS;  INDONESIAN BOAT TRAGEDY.

E  & O E - PROOF ONLY



STEVE VIZARD: On the line from Canberra, the Minister for Finance and Deregulation  Senator Penny Wong joins me. Penny, good to talk to you.

WONG: Morning Steve.

VIZARD: Good news.

WONG: Very good news for Australian families with mortgages, very good news for  businesses. 25 basis points. That means that a family with a $300,000 mortgage will pay  around $50 less a month in interest repayments, so that’s obviously very good news.

VIZARD: Commonwealth and Westpac have said they’re going to pass on the rate cut in  full. Where are the other two? What’s your view about what they ought to do?

WONG: We certainly welcome the decision by Westpac, which I think was out first, saying  we’d pass it on in full. As well as the Commonwealth, the Bank of Queensland and I think a  few other smaller institutions. They’ve done the right thing by their customers. I don’t think  there’s any justification for banks not to pass on the full rate cut. And I think any customer of  a bank who doesn’t do that is certainly within their rights to think about alternatives.

VIZARD: And they need to do it quickly. I mean when the interest rates go up they’re very  quick to put the hike on their own interest rates. You’d be disappointed if they eventually got  there but took a little too long, wouldn’t you?

WONG: I think it’s more than disappointed. I think it’s doing the right thing by their  customers. We believe competition is the best way of ensuring the best deal for Australians  from the banking system. And that’s why we’ve introduced a range of measures to support  competition that I think we’ve spoken about before.

VIZARD: One of the reasons the Reserve Bank presumably has reached its decision is  because of global uncertainty, and particularly what’s happened in Europe. And you only  have to look at what’s happened in Greece overnight, holding a referendum about a rescue  package. It’s like taking a vote on whether someone should apply a tourniquet when you’ve  been bitten by a snake, one can imagine. It is an uncertain time globally still, isn’t it?

WONG: A few points about that. Look it is a very disappointing situation in Greece, and we  look to the Europeans to resolve this. But I would say in terms of interest rates, one of the  reasons the Reserve Bank has had room to move, is obviously the Government is putting in  place a pretty strong fiscal consolidation. That is, bringing the budget back to black very  quickly. That obviously gives room for the Reserve Bank to move.

But you’re right, this is a volatile time. We accept that. What we do say to Australians is,  we’re determined to manage the economy for the best interests of Australians and their  families. And we do face this volatility with a great deal of strength.

VIZARD: So we’ve got a volatile international market and yet you want to return the budget  to black. And with that in mind you’re introducing the Government’s mining tax Bills today  into the Lower House. Is this the best time to be doing this?

WONG: This is absolutely the right time to be introducing a tax on mining which will spread  the benefits of the boom. We know that to Australia mining is very important. But we also  know that you can only dig these resources up once. And this is about making sure we use  the benefits of the mining boom and spread it across the country to other businesses that  aren’t in the fast lane, and to Australian workers through superannuation increases.

So this is a very important piece of legislation. It’s about dealing with a change that we  know is happening in the Australian economy, the patchwork economy, the Government’s  been talking about. We want to do something about that, and we want to spread that  opportunity. That’s what these bills do.

VIZARD: And yet it’s controversial. To get it up you’re going to need the support of, well,  four crossbench votes effectively, and Greens MP Adam Bandt. You need Tony Windsor,  you need Rob Oakeshott, you need Andrew Wilkie and you need Adam Bandt. Where are  they sitting at the moment, and what are you saying to them?

WONG: We are talking to the crossbenchers. But the reason this is controversial, the  reason that we have to speak to the crossbenchers, is yet again we have Tony Abbott  saying no.  And I think, leaving aside any partisan comments, the policy proposition, or the  policy issue, is this: Tony Abbott thinks miners should pay less tax, and that small business  and manufacturers should pay more.

That makes absolutely no sense if you’re interested in an economy that is focused on the  needs of working Australians, that’s focused on jobs, and focused on small business. Why  would you say miners should pay less tax? Now because he’s taken that position, we are  talking to the crossbenchers. We’ll continue to do that, because this is a very important  policy. It’s about securing the benefits of the boom now and into the future.

VIZARD: Could this be a repeat of the proposed amendments to the Migration Act where  you get done?

WONG: That’s not what we’re countenancing. What we’re saying is, this is very clear  legislation. We were very clear for a long time about the benefits of this. We have struck an  agreement with significant parts of the mining industry, and we are implementing that  agreement. We don’t want politics to get in the way of what is a reform that is absolutely in  our national interest. For today but also for the long-term - about strengthening our  economy for the long-term and for the next generation.

VIZARD: Penny can I just make an observation. I think one of the problems,  communication problems, amongst other things, that this Government has suffered from, is  it’s been great at setting out what it imposts on the community and on business it’s  proposing to put in place, and what taxes its going to introduce. But not so good, in fact  lousy, the polls would suggest, at setting out the vision for which those proceeds are to be  used, painting a picture for Australia in the future. Let’s just talk about the mining tax. Can  you succinctly set out a vision for Australia, particularly for which the proceeds from this  mining tax are going to be specifically applied?

WONG: We want to use the benefits of the mining boom to give tax breaks to small  business, to reduce tax for companies across the board and to increase the superannuation  savings of all Australians. So you reduce tax for business, you give Australian workers  more superannuation and you fund that by asking mining companies to pay a bit more tax.  That’s how you use the benefits of the boom.

VIZARD: I want to talk about Afghanistan, very quickly. We’ve got three more deaths of  Australian soldiers in Afghanistan. Very tragic, I think we’d all agree. Your Government has  said its going to stay the course. Do you understand what staying the course means?

WONG: We’ve laid out quite clearly why we’re there. We’ve been obviously, you know, like  everybody very, very saddened by the most recent tragic events there. And unfortunately  what we’ve seen is a lot of tragedy, and that’s what war brings. But there is an important job  there to do in terms of the transition. The Prime Minister has talked about that. And I think if  you listen to what the previous Chief of the Defence Force has said particularly, and more  recently, I think the Defence Force and soldiers do understand the important job that they’re  doing there. Having said that, it is very hard. We all know that behind each of these stories  is families and friends who are dealing with a real tragedy.

VIZARD: Are you convinced that in ten years time, for all the billions we’re spending and for  the loss of 32 lives, that we will have made any difference in Afghanistan ten years from  now?

WONG: I think we’re making a difference now. And we have made a difference. And we  should never forget that. That we are making a difference now, and people have made a  difference until now. What happens down the track, these are always issues I’m sure  people will debate then.

But we are making a difference, and what we need to ensure is that how we handle the  transition that the Prime Minister and the Minister for Defence have spoken about  recognises the benefits of the change that we’ve been part of.

VIZARD: Another asylum seeker tragedy, Penny Wong. A boat capsized off Java, and at  least five children at this point drowned. It could be any number, we just don’t know how  many people got on. It could be 70, it could be 100. Who do you say should bear  responsibility for these deaths?

WONG: I’m not sure I want to get into that. What I’d say is this is unfortunately another  terrible tragedy and it is our worst fears realised. Our motivation in putting in place the  arrangement with Malaysia was to try and remove the incentive, and remove the reason  that people get on boats. And I think we’ve had a stark, today, or yesterday rather, reminder  of why we don’t want people to get on boats.

VIZARD: If I could just ask you about your partner’s pregnancy, how’s she going?

WONG: She’s going well, thanks very much Steve -

VIZARD: And is she far into it?

WONG: She’s very healthy.

VIZARD: That’s good. And, she hasn’t had any cravings? Anything of that sort?

WONG: Well, she might have, but Sophie’s very private. I’m not sure talking on radio about  what she might have been eating would be - I think I might get into a bit of trouble. (laughs)

VIZARD: Very wise answer (laughs). Good on you Penny, great to talk to you.

WONG: Good to speak with you.
