Radio Australia ‘Pacific Beat’ Interview  with Corinne Podger  Transcript, E&OE, proof only

5 November 2012

Australia’s close relationship with Papua New Guinea is about to get a bit closer, with the  first visit to the country by Australia’s Parliamentary Secretary for Pacific Island Affairs,  Richard Marles, since PNG’s new government took office.

Mr Marles will spend two days in talks with senior officials including PNG’s Foreign, Health  and Environment Ministers. He will also take part in commemorations marking the 70th  anniversary of the retaking of Kokoda from the Japanese.

Mr Marles will also discuss concerns raised by landowners in relation to Australia’s planned  detention facility for asylum seekers on Manus Island and says he is confident Australia is  satisfying its responsibilities under international law with regard to its current facility in  Nauru.

RICHARD MARLES: This is the first visit I've made to Papua New Guinea since elections  in the middle of the year which successfully put there this new government of Peter O'Neill.

It's an opportunity to talk to PNG post-election; to look at the priorities that we both share  but, particularly, the PNG Government has for this term in office and see how they meld with  the shared development objectives that we have under our partnership for development.

It's a good opportunity to take stock. Of course all that happens in the context of a likely  ministerial forum in about a month's time. So, it's a good opportunity to talk about those  issues in advance of that.

CORINNE PODGER: Now health, talks with the Health Minister. Health has been a  particular focus of Australia-PNG relations this past week. An independent report prepared  by an Australian scientist for the government there was handed over last week and it looked  at how Papua New Guinea is handling TB diagnosis and treatment since the Australian-

funded clinic near the border shut down earlier this year. Have you had any reaction to that  report from the PNG government or will it be included in your meetings with Michael  Malabag?

RICHARD MARLES: I'm sure it will be a matter that is discussed during my visit. I've not  had personal communication with the PNG government about it but would expect it's an issue  to be raised. Certainly we want to work closely with the PNG government on dealing with the  issue of TB, particularly within the Western Province which is that part of PNG adjacent to  the Torres Strait.

The aim here is really working as closely as we can with the PNG government to try and  prevent the spread of multi-strain resistant tuberculosis which is of particular concern.

The other issue that we'll be talking about with the Health Minister is medical supply  procurement and a program we have there to support the government in the way it does that  procurement so it can be done more efficiently and effectively.

CORINNE PODGER: Now, you're also there to attend 70th anniversary commemorations  of the Kokoda campaign. What's planned for you while you're in the country?

RICHARD MARLES: We've got a reception tonight for a number of veterans who are in  PNG at the moment to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the Kokoda campaign. That's going  to be a very poignant moment, I think, because it's both a strong point of cultural identity for  Australians. But, increasingly, it's become an important point of commonality between  Australia and PNG with the work of the Fuzzy Wuzzy Angels which is so much a part of the  Kokoda story.

So I'm very much looking forward to the reception tonight and tomorrow at the Bomana War  Cemetery we'll be rededicating three war graves, two of whom are Australians who have now  been identified. Up until now those war graves had been unidentified or unknown Australian  soldiers. There'll be members of those soldiers' families present which I think will be a very  emotional moment and a moment of closure for them.

CORINNE PODGER: If we can just turn to another issue, which is very much a centre of  Australian policy at the moment when it comes to the Pacific and that's detention centres.  There is one planned for Manus Island in PNG and expectation that that will open fairly soon.  The discussion in Papua New Guinea has focused around unhappiness of some stakeholders  including landowners on the benefits of hosting the centre and whether they will receive  those. Will those concerns be addressed before the centre opens?

RICHARD MARLES: Those concerns are being addressed as we speak. Our High  Commissioner visited Manus Island last week with the Governor of Manus Island and spoke  with him about the sorts of issues that people of Manus Island would like to see as part of an  enhanced [indistinct] associated with facility. I think there is a working through of these  issues and a gaining of understanding on the part of all parties which is seeing this move  towards the facility being operational.

But really, if you take a step back, of course there have been some issues along the way, as  you would expect when you have negotiations of these kinds. But, really, the establishment  of the facility at Manus Island and these negotiations have been characterised by an enormous

amount of goodwill on both sides. I'm sure that we will see this facility up and running very  soon.

CORINNE PODGER: Now, just briefly and staying on the offshore processing issue for a  moment, what happens in Manus Island, obviously some eyes there will be looking to what's  going on on Nauru at the moment and on Friday the Human Rights Commission President,  Gillian Triggs, told this program that indeterminate periods in detention violates international  law. She said that she was in no doubt Australia would be questioned about that by the United  Nations Human Rights Council. Are comments like that a concern to the Government?

RICHARD MARLES: We are confident about our legal position, our international legal  position and we're confident on the basis of putting into place a no-advantage test. That is to  say that people will be in place in these facilities for an equivalent period of time they would  have expected to be had they been processed in the countries from which they've come.

That's actually not an indeterminate amount of time. That is a determined amount of time but  it is an equivalent amount of time to what they would have expected had they not got on a  boat. And that's a very important principle which forms part of the Houston Report, to make  sure that we remove any incentive whatsoever for people to get on those boats in the first  place. It's removing that incentive that will stop people making one of the most dangerous  journeys in pursuit of refuge anywhere in the world, a journey which is seeing people die in  their hundreds by making it.

So, that's the intention here of the Government and we're very confident of our position  internationally. We're very confident of our human rights position because ultimately it's  about saving lives.

CORINNE PODGER: Now, you mentioned it's your first visit to Papua New Guinea since  the election. Now, with Prince Charles and his wife Camilla in the country at the weekend,  there were some grumbles doing the rounds of PNG's social media platforms that Prime  Minister Julia Gillard and our Foreign Minister, Bob Carr, have yet to go there. Any plans for  Ms Gillard to get to PNG in the near future?

RICHARD MARLES: The Foreign Minister will be in PNG within the next month and he's  certainly been keen to visit PNG. If you're looking at the Foreign Minister's itinerary since he  became the Foreign Minister, we have had the PNG election period for a fair part of that and  visits during that time wouldn't have been appropriate. This is really the earliest opportunity  for the Foreign Minister to come.

In terms of the Prime Minister, obviously I'm not able to comment on the Prime Minister's  travel schedule but I would make the point that she has very close relationship with Peter  O'Neill. They have met on many occasions in many different forums. I think the most recent  meeting was in the Cook Islands. They will be at various international gatherings over the  next few days together. So there can be no doubt about the strength of that relationship  between Julia Gillard and the Prime Minister of PNG.
