ALP MPs For Refugees Should Now Vote With Greens: Brown

The dozens of 'ALP for Refugees' MPs who lost out to Labor's 'facsimile of Howard' *  refugee policies have been invited to vote with the Greens when parliament resumes in  February.

"The Greens will seek to amend forthcoming legislation to:   - end temporary protection visas   - close the Christmas Island detention centre   - remove children, women and men from behind mainland razor wire camps," Senator  Brown said.

"The Greens policies will not change. We want refugees in Australia to be treated  humanely and in accordance with international law.

"The Labor, and for that matter Liberal, MPs who oppose the Howard laws should back  the Greens. Voting in parliament is the test of commitment.

"I was sorry to hear Labor Immigration spokeswoman Nicola Roxon on the defensive  during yesterday's conference debate when she accused the Greens of having had zero  population policies.

"She is totally wrong and is using the Howard tactic of vilifying the innocent," Senator  Brown said.
