-  IT  IS  GRAVELY THREATENING EVERYBODY'S SECURITY.

ARMED CONFLICT CONTINUES IN MANY PARTS OF THE

WORLD, THERE ARE 10 M IL L IO N  REFUGEES AS A RESULT

OF SUCH CONFLICT.

-  IT  IS  A SCANDALOUS WASTE OF HUMAN RESOURCES AND

. EXPENDITURE ON ARMS.

-  T h e Se c r e t a r y -G e n e r a l  h a s s p o k e n  o f t h e  $1 m i l l i o n

SPENT EACH MINUTE ON ARMS. My CALCULATION IS  THAT

THE EXPENDITURE IS  NEARER TO $ 1 , 3 m . BUT NONE OF US

NEED TO BE TOLD HOW MUCH $1 M IL L IO N  PER MINUTE COULD

. PRODUCE IN TERMS OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF, FOR EXAMPLE, THE

LEAST DEVELOPED COUNTRIES.

. E ast/ west tension is  alarmingly h ig h .

-  ARMS CONTROL NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE SUPER POWERS

ARE IN D IF F IC U L T Y .
