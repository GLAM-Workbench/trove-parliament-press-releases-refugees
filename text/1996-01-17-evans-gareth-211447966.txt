PALESTINIAN ELECTIONS

Ten Australian observers will participate in an international team team supervising  this week's historic Palestinian elections, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator  Gareth Evans, said today.

The elections for a Palestinian Council will be held in Gaza and the West Bank on 20  January.

The Australian observers will be led by Mr Justice John Dowd of the New South  Wales Supreme Court: the other nine will be drawn from our diplomatic posts in the  Middle East. They will help supervise vote counting and the general conduct of the  elections.

"The elections for a Palestinian Council are a major milestone in the Middle East  peace process," Senator Evans said.

"They represent the culmination of the interim phase of the Israeli-Palestinian  negotiations. The Palestinian Authority will now take over from Israel responsibility for  civil administration for Palestinian citizens.

"The Australian Government has been encouraged by the determination of the  Government of Israel and the Palestinian Authority to overcome the considerable  obstacles which have beset the negotiations and the practical implementation of the  Interim Agreement. These elections are a sign of the maturity and irreversiblity of the  peace process.

Senator Evans praised Israel for the support it had given to the Palestinian election  process by implementing key elements of the Interim Agreement ahead of schedule.  Senator Evans appealed to all sides to ensure that the elections are conducted freely  and fairly.

"Australia will continue to contribute to the peace process in modest but practical  ways," Senator Evans said.

For example, we are funding Australian lawyers to help the Palestinian Authority  develop legal institutions and procedures.

"This project should provide the Palestinian people with a better basis for the rule of  law and the application of justice in a parliamentary democracy ."
