PRESS STATEMENT BY THE MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION.

THE HON. HUBERT OPPERMAN. M.P.

The Minister for Immigration, Mr. Hubert Opperman,

M . P . ,  returned to Australia today after a ten weeks overseas

tour in which he had discussions with the Governments of 12

different countries.

"It is good to have this Government-to-Goverhment

understanding on a new and up-to-date basis",  he said.

"Everywhere I went overseas I found lively interest in

migration to Australia. Our name abroad stands high.

"We have established ourselves internationally as an

example of efficient migration operation and smooth integration",

he said.

"Direct contact with the Australian immigration

offices overseas has been stimulating and informative for all

who participated in it, and I have been most impressed by their

efficiency and devotion.

"None-the-less we will have to make even more strenuous

efforts to maintain and expand, the flow of,migrants we need -

which is so essential to our country's future.

"All concerned (and especially prospective employers)

must seek and join in new and imaginative measures to ensure

that our opportunities are known and the right migrants are

attracted to take them.

"Britain continues to provide a lively flow of migrants.

In the year just ended we received a record number of 70,000 Â·

assisted passage migrants from Britain.

"Co-cperation there between my Department and State

representatives and employers' delegations has been a notable

reason, for our success.

"I have seen the European Common Market as a working

reality with traditional sources such as Germany and Holland

themselves bringing in workers from other countries.

"This makes vigorous new efforts by all involved in

immigration both in and out of the Government imperative.

We cannot afford to rest on our laurels".

Mr. Opperman said that while in Geneva he assured the

United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees,  Mr. Felix

Schnyder,  of Australia's continued support for resettling refugees

"I told him that although we allow for 1,500 refugees

in our year's assisted migration programme,  this figure was not

inflexible," said Mr. Opperman. -  .

Mr. Opperman said that when he addressed the

Intergovernmental Committee for European Migration (I.C.E.M.)

in Geneva, he was able to say with pride that the 417,000

Ã¢ÂÂ   migrants who. had come to Australia through I.C.E.M. had made a

Ã¢ÂÂ -.far-reaching impact on. Australia 5s development and progress,

not only economically,Â·.Ã¢ÂÂ hut also socially and.culturally.

"I also spoke about .-the. diligent ..and purposeful work '

done by voluntary organisations throughout Australia to help

new. settlers become .integrated into the Australian community",

he said.

migration to Australia, and-pointed to the great benefit '
