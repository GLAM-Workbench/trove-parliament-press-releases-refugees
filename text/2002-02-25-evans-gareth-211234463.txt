INTERESTING TIMES: MEETING THE NEXT GENERATION OF GLOBAL SECURITY 
CHALLENGES

Address by Gareth Evans, President of the International Crisis Group 
and former Foreign Minister of Australia, to the Asia Pacific Security 
Conference, Institute of Defence and Strategic Studies, Singapore, 25

Â

When it comes to conducting international affairs, there’s much 
to be said for being a congenital optimist. If you believe instinctively 
that all problems have solutions, it encourages you to go out and find 
them. If you believe that the world is not necessarily condemned to 
go on repeating the mistakes of the past, it encourages you to find 
better ways of doing things. And if you believe that human nature is, 
if not perfectible, at least improvable , it encourages you to not rule 
out dealing with those whose past behaviour has been indefensible.

Â

Â

Â

This kind of optimismÂ  - much fuelled by the end of the Cold 
War and the new era of international cooperation it seemed to heraldÂ  
- certainly sustained me for most of the years I was Australia’s Foreign 
Minister, from 1988 to 1996. It was very much what lay behind our peace 
plan for Cambodia, our initiation of APEC, our role in the creation 
of the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF), our bridge-building with Indonesia 
to the point even of signing a joint security agreement, our initiation 
of the Canberra Commission on the Elimination of Nuclear Weapons, our 
successful efforts to bring the Chemical Weapons Convention to conclusion 
and our (rather less successful) efforts to strengthen and reshape and 
the peace and security role of the United Nations.

Â

Â

Â

These were just some of the adventures on which I don’t think we 
would have even embarked had we been over-impressed by the fallibility 
of human nature or the inevitability of Murphy’s Law - and O’Toole’s 
less well known corollary (“If you’re feeling good, don’t worry: 
you’ll get over it”).

Â

Â

Â

But that was a few years ago. I have to say that these days, with 
the excitement of the early post-Cold War years long evaporated, and 
the horror of September 11 firmly etched in all our minds, it’s much 
harder to be an optimist. Confrontation is as much as cooperation. Nuanced 
multilateral diplomacy has few supporters left in Washington, and few 
effective practitioners in Europe. Arms control and disarmament regimes 
are, with few exceptions, heading backwards. The Middle East is aflame, 
Africa still desolate, Latin America stumbling and many parts of Asia 
fragile. APEC seems marginalised, and ARF not much further advanced 
than it was in the mid-90s. And in my own former patch, the current 
Government of Australia has done its best to demonstrate that not only 
does it not want to be part of Asia, but it really feels quite comfortable 
being not part of the rest of the world either…

Â

Â

Â

As we enter the 21  st  century, the kind of security challenges 
we face in this environment, and seem likely to go on facing for a long 
while yet, fall essentially into five categories.

Â

Â

Â

Internal Conflicts

Â

Â

Â

First, there continues to be every reason to 
remain anxious about   internal conflicts,   the most characteristic form of serious 
violence since the end of the Cold War. Of the 56 major armed conflicts 
which occurred between 1990 and 2000, those involving more than 1000 
battle deaths in one year, 53 of them were interstate in character [SIPRI 
figures]. Millions of human beings around the world remain at the mercy 
of civil wars, insurgencies, and state collapse. While most of these 
conflicts and crises have occurred in the developing South, far away 
from the centres of Western authority and culture, the hard lesson is 
being learned that their effects can and do reach all the way into the 
Northern heartland - in the form of terrorism, refugee outflows, narcotics 
trafficking, organised crime, health pandemics andÂ  sometimes environmental 
impacts as well.

Â

Â

Â

The international response 
to internal conflictÂ  - and in particular the issue of so-called 
‘humanitarian intervention’, or military intervention for human 
protection purposes -Â  has been intensely controversial throughout 
the last decade. In Rwanda the world stood by as 800,000 people were 
killed in a genocidal onslaught.Â  When interventions did occur 
with Security Council approval, as in Somalia and Bosnia, they were 
usually too little too late, misconceived, poorly resourced, poorly 
executed, or all of the above. And where intervention occurred without 
Security Council approval, as in Kosovo, it generated a major international 
backlash.

Â

Â

Â

While since September 11 
the spotlight has shifted away from these situations, nothing, unhappily, 
is more certain than that sooner or later reports will emerge again 
- from Asia, Africa, the Balkans or somewhere - of massacres or 
mass starvation, or rape or ethnic cleansing, happening or about to 
happen. Then the question will arise all over again in the Security 
Council and in political capitals and in the media - what do we do?Â  
And this time round we must have the answers. Few things have done more 
harm to our shared ideal that we are all equal in worth and dignity, 
and that the earth is our common home, than the inability of the community 
of states to prevent and respond effectively to genocide, massacre and 
ethnic cleansing.

Â

Â

Â

One set of answers has been 
suggested recently. The Canadian sponsored International Commission 
on Intervention and State Sovereignty, which I co-chaired with Mohamed 
Sahnoun of Algeria, has just presented to the Secretary General of the 
UN a major report in which we argue for a complete reconceptualisation 
of the whole intervention debate, in which the focus becomes not the 
‘right’ of anyone to intervene, but the ‘responsibility’ of 
everyone to   protect  .Â Â  Drawing on evolving law andÂ  
practice in international human rights recognition, and the emerging 
emphasis on human securityÂ  rather than just state security, we 
argue that theÂ  responsibility to protect is owed in the first 
instance by sovereign states, but when they are unable or unwilling 
to protect their own citizens from large scale loss of life or ethnic 
cleansing, the responsibility to protect shifts to the international 
community of states. The responsibility to protect, as we conceive it, 
has not just one but three dimensions -Â  a responsibility to 
prevent, a responsibility to react if prevention fails, and a post-intervention 
responsibility to rebuild.

Â

Â

Â

My Commission argues further 
that military intervention is appropriate, and indeed make a forceful 
call for it, if certain conditions are satisfied. Those conditions areÂ  
a ‘just cause’, in the sense that theÂ  harm occurring or apprehended 
must be of a defined degree of gravity; ‘right intention’, a requirement 
best assured by multilateral operations; ‘last resort’, in the sense 
that non-military options must have been properly explored; ‘proportional 
means’, in the sense of the minimum necessary force to meet the objective 
being applied; and finally, ‘right authority’, which we identify 
squarely as the Security Council, or failing that the General Assembly 
of the UN.

Â

Â

Â

In the event that the Security 
Council does not authorise appropriate enforcement action in a conscience-shocking 
situation clearly crying out for it - as was the case with Rwanda, 
and I wouldÂ  certainly argue, Kosovo - then my Commission makes 
the point that in those circumstances other concerned states may well 
take action unilaterally to meet the gravity and urgency of the situation. 
But there are downside risks in their doing so, not least that if the 
intervention is successful, the Security Council’s failure to act 
will call into question the stature and credibility of the whole UN 
system.Â  We argued, and I hope very much this is accepted by the 
community of states in the future, that the task was not to find alternatives 
to the Security Council as a source of authority, but to make the Security 
Council work better than it has.

Â

Â

Â

Conflict Between States

Â

Â

Â

This approach is highly relevant 
to the second security challenge the global community faces in the years 
ahead,Â    conflict 
between states  . Until 
very recently, it has been possible to argue that interstate conflict 
is, these days, a much less real threat than internal conflict. Wars 
between states had become rare and seemed likely to go on being improbable, 
for a number of good reasons, including the virtual disappearance in 
advanced countries of   bellicisme  , the ideology that saw virtue and nobility in 
war, and the impact of globalisation, with the interdependence and opportunity 
it involved making borders ever less important than they had traditionally 
been.

Â

Â

Â

Again, the massively united 
international response to Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait laid down a very 
clear additional marker that, in the post-Cold War era, territorial 
aggression, for economic or any other reasons, was not likely to be 
very cost effective. In this environment, the bloody war that did erupt 
between Eritrea and Ethiopia seemed an almost incomprehensible aberration, 
a function of egos out of control rather than any kind of rational calculation.

Â

Â

Â

But recent events have made 
it impossible to be so optimistic. Just a few weeks ago India and Pakistan 
were much closer to the brink of all out war, over Kashmir and related 
issues, than has generally been recognised: any one of a number of small 
mishaps or miscalculations could have triggeredÂ  a major catastrophe, 
with the use of nuclear weapons by either side not out of the question. 
The Israel-Palestinian conflict - which is far more of an interstate 
than intrastate character - continues to hover on the precipice of 
all out war, and will continue to do so as long as the resumption of 
serious political negotiations is made hostage to the last extremist 
on either side, as they are under the present formula of ‘peace first 
- then talks’. And there are a number of other situations which, while 
not for the moment so volatile, do remain hostage to the retention of 
very cool heads on both sidesÂ  - among them, in this region, China-Taiwan, 
the South China Sea and the Korean peninsula.

Â

Â

Â

We also have the post September 
11 phenomenon of war between states being waged for self-defence purposes, 
as permitted under Article 51 of the UN Charter in response to armed 
attack. America’s short and devastating campaign against Afghanistan 
- as the state protecting and harbouring the Al Qaeda leaders believed 
responsible for orchestrating 911 -Â  was totally justifiable in 
this context. It was not seriously controversial in the international 
community.Â  But what, however,   is   extremely controversial is any possible extension 
of that self-defence reasoning to justify war being waged unilaterally 
(i.e. without Security Council approval, based in turn on there being 
a threat to “international peace and security”), against other countries 
perceived to be a threat to the United States or its allies.

Â

Â

Â

That spectre has of course 
been raised by President Bush’s State of the Union Address on 29 January, 
in which he described Iraq, Iran and North Korea as constituting “an 
axis of evil, arming to threaten the peace of the world”, spelt out 
his Administration’s goal as being “to prevent regimes that sponsor 
terror from threatening America or our friends and allies with weapons 
of mass destruction” and stated that the U.S. “will not permit the 
world’s most dangerous regimes to threaten us with the world’s most 
destructive weapons”. So we now haveÂ  yoked together as immediate 
potential targets three regimes which, however unlovely, are not alone 
in proliferating or sponsoring terrorism; are not a united axis in any 
obvious sense; are not equally culpable in their past actions; are not 
equally uncooperative in their present behaviour; and are not on the 
face of it requiring anything like the same un-nuanced strategy to get 
them to behave consistently better in the future.

Â

Â

Â

Immediately following this 
address came a Presidential budget request for a defence spending   increase   of $48 
billion (larger than the total military budget of any other country 
in the world, and bringing US military spending to 40 per cent of the 
global total - double its global share of GDP), a breathtaking but 
not illogical product of the new US doctrine which assessesÂ  defence 
needs in terms of others’ capability, not the actual threat they pose.Â  
Given all this, it is not surprising that the international, and even 
domestic, applause for the new US doctrine has been a little less than 
tumultuous. Nor is it surprising that there has been something of a 
scramble subsequently, not least in the context of the President’s 
recent Asian trip, to disentangle the three countries and to make it 
clear that it is only really Iraq that is in the gunsights in the reasonably 
foreseeable future: for the others, it seems, Churchill’s maxim that 
“jaw jaw is preferable to war war” is, for the time being anyway, 
to prevail.

Â

Â

Â

Nonetheless in the case of 
Iraq the prospect of major military action is very real indeed, and 
the issues raised by this are ones the international community will 
have to grapple with very soon: it’s a test case for a kind of security 
issue that may recur in the years ahead, so long as the US enjoys its 
present exceedingly asymmetrical power, and other countries from time 
to time pose real or perceived threats to it, or its friends and allies.

Â

Â

Â

It is certainly not unreasonable 
to paint Iraq as a potentially major threat to international peace and 
security, given its established track record in the production and use 
of weapons of mass destruction, its known capability andÂ  its suspected 
intentions. And it is not at all unreasonable to propose that some major 
new pressure be placed upon it.Â  But the way to deal with the whole 
issue should be through the UN Security Council, which exists, and is 
fully mandated, to deal with precisely such threats. The most obvious 
way of addressing the issue is for the Security Council to deliver a 
major ultimatum demanding the return of fully empowered weapons inspectors, 
and indeed the US does appear at the moment to be working toward that 
end.

Â

Â

Â

The real question will arise 
if the other members of the Security Council are not prepared to go 
along with issuing such a demand; or, if that demand is made and not 
answered, if they thenÂ  retreat from taking appropriate enforcement 
action - including ultimately military action; or if events unfold 
in some other way requiring forceful follow- through action.

Â

Â

Â

It is at these points that 
those powers who say they are committed to multilateral processes, and 
who find deeply distasteful the US tendency to unilateralism - an 
understandableÂ  viewpoint -Â  may have to put their money where 
their mouths are.   If   the evidence for strong Security Council action 
is compelling (and that is a big ‘if’, and a precondition for anything 
else); and   if   credible enforcement action can be identified, 
which will in fact improve rather than worsen the overall security environment 
(and that is another very big ‘if’)Â  - then that evidence 
should be acted upon, without the luxury of applying double standards 
of the kind that the US is so often accused of.

Â

Â

Â

Â In the context of Iraq, 
this won’t be easy for at least three of the Permanent Five: Russia, 
China and France. But if the credibility of the cooperative security 
system of the UN is to be maintained, that’s the kind of decision 
that comes with P5 territory.Â  If some major powers are not prepared 
to make the hard calls, then they will have to accept that others may 
make them unilaterally. And, just as I suggested was the case with the 
question of internal intervention for human protection purposes, for 
that to happen, in a case clearly justifying action, would certainly 
put at risk the stature and credibility of the UN. So it is very much 
to be hoped that common ground will be found among the major players.

Â

Â

Â

Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction

Â

Â

Â

The third big global security 
problem we face in this new century, exemplified by the case of Iraq 
and its alleged cohorts, is   proliferation 
of weapons of mass destruction.   The problem 
is immense, and immensely real.Â  In the case of chemical weapons, 
where there is a widely supported banning treaty in place, some kind 
of international consensus is holding together, but financial support 
is waning for the kind of rigorous inspection regime that would give 
maximum confidence in the treaty’s effectiveness. In the case of biological 
weapons, the existing treaty regime is faltering, with failed recent 
attempts to introduce a workable inspection system.

Â

Â

Â

In the case of nuclear weapons, 
the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty 
are both faltering, with less than universal support, and less than 
total commitment to their terms from the countries that matter; weapons-grade 
fissile material continues to be produced; and controls over trade in 
materials, technology and information remain extremely inadequate. And 
in the case of delivery systems, the ABM - for so long an effective 
strategic stabiliser - is all but dead as the US continues to pursue 
its $150 billion faith-based missile defence program.

Â

Â

Â

The recent entry of India 
and Pakistan to the nuclear weapons state club - joining the five 
original declared nuclear powers and Israel - should remind us once 
again of the simple but powerful conclusions of the Canberra Commission 
on the Elimination of Nuclear Weapons a few years ago:Â  that so 
long as any state retains nuclear weapons, others will want them; that 
so long as any state has them, they are bound one day to be used, if 
not by design then by accident; and that any such use will be catastrophic 
for humankind.

Â

Â

Â

The compelling force of these 
conclusions continue, unfortunately, to leave the relevant policy makers 
unmoved, for reasons that are never very compellingly explained. Why, 
in the post Cold War World, it is necessary to ultimately retain, after 
a series of progressive reductions, any nuclear weapons at all for balance 
of terror reasons is not at all clear. Why you need nuclear, chemical 
or biological weapons to deter rogue states producing or using them, 
when current generation conventional weapons give you all the deterrent 
or retaliatory muscle you could ever need, is never explained. And the 
notion that you need a nuclear or CBW armoury to deal with terrorist 
groups or individuals producing home-made weapons of this kind is simply 
ludicrous.

Â

Â

Â

Containing the spread, and 
stopping the use, of weapons of mass disruption is quintessentially 
a task for international cooperation, through agreed treaty regimes 
and committedÂ  follow up verification and other supporting action. 
Here, more than anywhere else, unilateral action is absolutely useless 
and absolutely counterproductive.

Â

Â

Â

Terrorism

Â

Â

Â

Terrorism, carried out by whatever means, is - 
as we have become all too acutely consciousÂ  since 11 September 
2001 -Â  the next big global security challenge we will continue 
to confront in the years ahead. Before 911 terrorism was seen as indefensible 
and unacceptable means of waging war, or pursuing political objectives, 
but not itself as something to wage war against in the traditional military 
sense. Since 911 all that has changed. For the first time in history 
non-state actors showed themselves to be capable of waging as much destruction 
as state actors.Â  Terrorists have become first order global enemies, 
with countries knowingly harbouring them subject to full-scale military 
attack.Â  The shift of focus is understandable enough, from a global 
as well as well as just a US perspective, when one considers that on 
11 September 2001 more lives were lost to terrorist activity in a single 
morning than in Israel and Ireland combined over the last 50Â  years.

Â

Â

Â

And that was with zero technology, raising the 
obvious anxiety that if that’s what twenty hijackers willing to commit 
suicide can do when armed only with box-cutters (albeit also armed with 
the imagination to leverage those weapons up to the scale of fuel-laden 
jetliners), how much more havoc could be caused by twenty terrorist 
armed with brief cases full of nerve gas, or suitcase-sizedÂ Â  
or delivery-van sized nuclear devices? The problem is not one for the 
US alone - though it no doubt will remain a preferred target - but 
for every major country and every major city in the world.

Â

Â

Â

The challenge posed by terrorism 
operates at three levels.Â  One is to hunt down and bring toÂ Â Â  
justice, or at least to their just deserts, the perpetrators of terrorist 
crimes and those who harbour them.Â  The second is homeland security, 
to build better internal defences against future terrorist activity. 
The third, and in many ways most important, dimension of the challenge 
- and the one on which I want to focus here -Â Â  is to build 
sustainable   international   defences against future terrorist activity. The 
first line of suchÂ  international defence must beÂ  the frontline 
states and authorities,Â  the countries of origin of the terrorists 
themselves. Nobody can do the job required better than they can -Â  
internal crackdown,Â  combined with strong external cooperation 
in supplying intelligence, breaking financial supply lines and offering 
logistic support.

Â

Â

Â

Given the primacy of the 
role of the frontline countries, the key to strengthening international 
defences is thus to build the   capacity   and above all the   will   for them to act, bearing in mind that the governments 
in questionÂ  may not have much physical capacity - and will need 
a great deal of financial and technical assistance to develop it -Â  
and that their will may be limited by the political realities they confront 
domestically. If we want, as we must, strong local action and strong 
local cooperation with international authorities, we have to go all 
out to create environments in the countries in question in which there 
is more community support for cracking down on terrorism, and in which 
insecure governments and authorities will feel more confident in doing 
so.

Â

Â

Â

And that in turn means that 
it is important to adopt, as at least part of the repertoire of responses 
to terror, ‘root cause’ strategies, designed to address the problem 
at source - addressing the policy issues that we know generate grievance, 
and the social and economic conditions that we know generate despair. 
It is in this context (building the capacity and will of the frontline 
states), that US and other major Western powers should be making a major 
effort to address some of the unresolved conflicts and policy issues 
- the Israel/Palestine conflict preeminent among them - which have 
been creating the environment in which terrorist leaders, whatever their 
own motives, can find recruits and mass support.Â

Â

Â

Â

And it is in this context 
too - building the capacity and will of frontline states - that 
it is important to address some of the economicÂ  and social conditions 
in which grievance flourishes : by making a sustained effort to improve 
social conditions, reduce disparities of wealth, create more and more 
economic opportunity, to create more and more educational opportunity, 
and to create more responsive governance. To do all this is not to ‘reward’ 
terrorist behaviour: it’s to answer it.

Â

Â

Â

Weapons of Mass Disruption

Â

Â

Â

The last of the five global 
challenges to which I want to refer is the emergence of a quite new 
kind of risk, posed by what have been called   weapons 
of mass disruption.   Â It 
is becoming increasingly recognised that terrorists and other enemies 
of the state, internal and external, don’t necessarily have to employ 
traditional violent means, or engage in any kind of direct bloodshed 
at all, in order to advance their objectives. Huge economic loss, catastrophic 
breakdowns in social order and the collapse of effective governance 
are all within the realm of the achievable.

Â

Â

Â

One way in is through cyberspace, 
with modern communications networks being extraordinarily vulnerable 
to well-designed attack. The software is already available through which 
there could be distributed through the Internet millions of “sleeper” 
viruses programmed to attack specific machines or networks at a predetermined 
date.

Â

Â

Â

At a more prosaic, low-tech 
level,Â  there is for example the scenario painted in a recent issue 
of   Foreign Policy  , whereby a number of small groups positioned 
outside key electrical substationsÂ  and alongside key power transmission 
lines in a number of key regions, on a hot summer’s night with all 
systems overloaded, could simultaneously fire off over the substations 
home-made mortars full of aluminium chaff,Â  and float helium balloons 
with long tails into the power lines. The results would be spectacular: 
the national electrical system short-circuited, causing a cascade of 
power failures across the country. Communications systems break down; 
traffic lights shut down; water and sewerage systems are disabled. The 
financial system - and the national economy - come to a grinding 
halt.

Â

Â

Â

Of all the security threats 
I have identified, that from ‘weapons of mass disruption’ is perhaps 
the hardest of all to guard against, both conceptually and practically. 
Some creative thinking is obviously called for, mainly involving loosening 
andÂ  decoupling some of the interconnections that are now so comprehensive 
in information and energy and other service systems; developing circuit 
breakers of different kinds to limit the spread of damage when it does 
occur; and developing emergency response systems to a much greater pitch 
of efficiency. Beyond that, it is just a matter, as always, of improving 
prevention - in these cases mainly throughÂ  better intelligence,Â  
and in particular better and more confident international intelligence 
exchanges.

Â

Â

Â

Conclusion

Â

Â

Â

There are no simple answers 
to any of the classes of security threat I have identified as problems 
for the global community in the years ahead. With the prospect of more 
internal conflict, conflict between states, the proliferation of weapons 
of mass destruction, terrorism and the problem of weapons of mass disruption, 
there doesn’t seem much chance of any of us avoiding the old Chinese 
curse that we live in “interesting times”.

Â

Â

Â

But if there are no simple 
answers, there are some simple messages which run through all the kinds 
of responses to these threats that I have suggested as appropriate. 
The first is   cooperate  :   Â countries 
should act together rather than in splendid isolation in addressing 
these various threats, both because that is what for the most part is 
required by the UN Charter - the only dominant system of security 
law that we have, which we would have to invent if it didn’t exist 
- and because in the real contemporary world, however big you are, 
most international problems are only solvable with the help of others.

Â

Â

Â

The second message is   be comprehensive:   address 
security problems in a way that recognises they are not one-dimensional, 
and that social, economic and cultural factors can be at least as important 
as political and military ones in explaining why people and governments 
act as they do, and in persuading them to act otherwise.

Â

Â

Â

The third message is   be    creative  : always 
be willing as policy makers to push outÂ  the envelope, to explore 
new ways of addressing and solving not only new problems - like weapons 
of mass disruption - but old ones like inter and intra-state conflict.

Â

Â

Â

And the fourth is   give priority to prevention  : whatever 
else you do, always remember that it’s far more cost effective in 
terms of money, lives, pain, suffering and property damage to address 
and resolve problems at source, before they explode into violent conflict. 
There are plenty of preventive tools available - political and diplomatic, 
legal, economic and military - and plenty of institutional ways of 
mobilising them, including through regional organisations: the problem 
as always is to mobilise the political will to take preventive action 
at the time it would actually be useful. This is the cause to which 
my organisation, the International Crisis Group, is dedicated, and the 
one to which I have dedicated my own professional life since leaving 
politics and government three years ago.

Â

Â

Â

ICG is now a multi-million 
dollar organisation, employing over 70 analysts in more than twenty 
crisis locations across four continents, and a lot of policy makers 
and those who influence them are now taking our reports and recommendations 
seriously. Prevention is not a very glamorous businessÂ  - how could 
it be when the whole logic of your position is that you succeed when 
nothing happens, and nobody takes any notice? Your triumphs, almost 
by definition, go unnoticed. But the sense that, just every now and 
again, what you and your organisation has done   has   made some difference, and that you may just have 
helped to save some lives that would otherwise have been destroyed, 
is what keeps us all going.

Â

Â

Â

There may not be much of 
a place any more for congenital optimists in this world of ours, as 
experience keeps triumphing over hope, and expectations are disappointed 
more often than they are ever met. But there’s certainly a place, 
and a very honoured place, for policy makers and analysts and writers 
and thinkers - whether military or civilian or non-government - 
who try not only to understand what’s going on and to prepare for 
the worst, but who are actively committed to making things better.Â  
I am sure that is the spirit in which the overwhelming majority of those 
present here today are attending this conference, and I am honoured 
to have been given the opportunity to talk to you about these issues.

Â
