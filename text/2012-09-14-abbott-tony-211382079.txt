14 September 2012

TRANSCRIPT OF THE HON. TONY ABBOTT MHR  INTERVIEW WITH KARL STEFANOVIC,  TODAY, NINE NETWORK

Subjects: Border protection; Quarterly Essay.

E&OE……………………….…………………………………………………………………

KARL STEFANOVIC:

Tony, good morning to you.

TONY ABBOTT:

`Morning, Karl.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

We’ll get to those stories from your uni days in a moment, but first, asylum seekers are off to Nauru. You  must be pleased about that.

TONY ABBOTT:

Yes, but it’s only one element of the policies that are needed to stop the boats. What we’ve been saying for a  decade now, Karl, is that you need Nauru and Manus, yes, but you also need temporary protection visas to  deny the people smugglers a product to sell and you need the willingness to turn boats around where it’s safe  to do so and my fear is that without all of the elements of an effective policy, the people smugglers will just  conclude that this government’s heart is not in it and the boats will keep coming.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

A step in the right direction, though?

TONY ABBOTT:

And when the Government finally, belatedly, after four years of demonising Nauru, said ‘Yes, let’s do it’,  the Coalition cheered.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

Alright, let’s talk about your time in student politics. It’s been the subject of much debate over the past few  days. In response to claims made in David Marr’s Quarterly Essay that you allegedly punched the walls  either side of Barbara Ramjan, who was a woman who ran against you and beat you for president of the  student council, you said firstly that you had no recollection of the incident. You said, quote, ‘It would be  profoundly out of character had it occurred’, then you decided that it never happened. What made your  memory suddenly recover?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, Karl, I had no recollection of it because it had never happened. Simple as that.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

It never happened?

TONY ABBOTT:

It never happened.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

Why didn’t you come out straight away and say that?

TONY ABBOTT:

I had no recollection of it, Karl, because it had never happened. Now, if something hasn’t happened  obviously you can’t have any recollection of it.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

Ok, so just to put it to bed, that incident never happened? For the record.

TONY ABBOTT:

Never happened.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

Ok. Yesterday in another Fairfax article, Sydney barrister David Patch supported Barbara’s claim that you  acted in an intimidating fashion. He said, quote, ‘I did not see the incident but I was nearby. The count had  just finished, Barbara found me, she is a small woman and Tony Abbott was and is a strong man. She was  very shaken, scared and angry. She told me that Tony Abbott had come up to her, put his face in her face  and punched the wall on either side of her head.’ He says, ‘So I am a witness. Barbara’s immediate  complaint to me about what Abbott had just done had the absolute ring of truth about it. I believed Barbara  at the time and still do.’ Why would Barbara make it up?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, first of all, David Patch is a former Labor candidate and I think there is no doubt that the Labor Party  dirt unit is running a serious campaign here and I’ve been saying to Margie and the kids, Karl, that they can  expect a lot more of this between now and polling day. Just look at what the Labor Party did to Campbell  Newman and his family in the lead-up to the Queensland election. But David Patch did not see anything  happen because nothing happened. Simple as that.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

But why would Barbara make it up, then?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, that’s a question for her. I guess the issue for me is why is it only now, 35 years after this alleged  incident is supposed to have taken place, that she’s gone public with it? She did go public some years ago, as  I recollect, with a complaint about me but amidst all the complaints that she’s made over the years, this one  never figured until now.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

He also went on to write, ‘As president, Ramjan chaired SRC meetings. She did not want to be called Mr  Chairman but preferred chairperson and for an entire year Mr Abbott called Ramjan ‘Chairthing’ whenever  he addressed her at SRC meetings. Is that true?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think that’s an exaggeration. Look, a lot of things happened in those days, many of which were pretty  childish. Let’s be absolutely honest about it, Karl. A lot of childish and immature things happen on student  councils and I think I probably was guilty of using that silly phrase but look, silly things happen on campus,  alas.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

Then yesterday, another witness came forward to contradict your denial. This man, a student at the time, was  out at the SRC offices photocopying when he says, quote, ‘Abbott’s famous flying squad of goons crashed  down the stairs, threw me against the wall, kicked in the doors of the SRC and started creating havoc’. He  says, ‘I saw Abbott throw a punch at Barbara Ramjan but didn’t see it land. When next I saw her, she was in  an extremely shocked condition, leaning against the wall. I thought he had actually struck her but I can see  that was simply my assumption and rationalisation.’ He goes on to say, ‘Ms Ramjan says the punches were  aimed next to her head. I can’t actually in fact contradict that. Simply, I saw Abbott swinging punches and  certainly indulging in serious argy-bargy. I saw him swing a punch, I saw her in great distress’. Now, this  witness wants to remain anonymous, as you would know, but he is willing to sign a stat-dec about what he  saw if necessary. How do you respond to that?

TONY ABBOTT:

Assumptions and rationalisations. I think out of his own mouth he’s undermined his own story and the fact  that this gentleman, whoever he is, or she is, wants to remain anonymous, suggests that there’s not an  enormous amount of credibility here. As I said, Karl, there is no doubt that we have a desperate Labor Party  and a desperate Labor Party will do desperate things in order to try to save an election that they absolutely  don’t deserve to win.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

There are more and more people coming out saying that they saw something. Are you suggesting that  everyone’s making it up?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, the only claim of a specific incident - as opposed to people saying they saw something but they’re not  quite sure what, or they heard something but they didn’t see anything - is the initial claim from Barbara

Ramjan and the point I make is that if she is so convinced that something happened, why has it taken her 35  long years to raise this matter?

KARL STEFANOVIC:

Cartoonist Lindsay Foyle says that as a student in the 70s you wanted to punch his head in because you  disagreed with him over abortion and contraception. Is he making that up?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I saw that piece late yesterday evening and look, I had a lot of very vigorous discussions with my  fellow journalists in various pubs over the years. I’m sure you’ve had a few yourself, Karl, but the idea that  fisticuffs or threatened fisticuffs would ensue from this, again, I think is just ludicrous. Now, I spoke last  night to one of the people who was cited in Lindsay Foyle’s article. In fact, I spoke to two of the people who  were cited in Lindsay Foyle’s article and neither of them can remember anything remotely, remotely  resembling what was alleged.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

Do you remember hitting people on the rugby field?

TONY ABBOTT:

Karl, look, I certainly did throw some punches on the rugby field. If you go back to the 1970s and the 1980s  and you watch footage of Sydney grade rugby matches from those days, there were a few punches thrown  and yes, I admit it, I was one of them.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

How many people did you hit on the rugby field?

TONY ABBOTT:

Oh, look, not that many. Karl, I think I can safely say that I was hit far more often; I was much more of a  punchee than a puncher.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

You’d remember how many people you hit, though. Do you recollect that?

TONY ABBOTT:

Karl, look, the short answer is I can’t. Can you remember how many beers you had six months ago?

KARL STEFANOVIC:

Well, you ask me on any given night but I’m not running for PM either. I think they’re legitimate questions  that people have the right to know about the person who may be the next Prime Minister and in relation to  that question, all I would say is, if I hit a wall, I would remember. You don’t remember that happening?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, I have absolutely no recollection and how can I have a recollection of something that has never, never  happened?

KARL STEFANOVIC:

And if more people come out and say it, why wouldn’t you take a legal action against those people, if it is an  attack on your character?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, why dignify these claims?

KARL STEFANOVIC:

They’re pretty serious claims, though. If you’re going to be the next Prime Minister wouldn’t you want to  put those claims to bed?

TONY ABBOTT:

And I am putting those claims to bed, Karl. I have no recollection of them. I have no recollection of them  because they simply never happened and there is no one who has come forward to corroborate them. Simple  as that.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

There have been two or three people that have come out already in the last couple of days who say they  support that action. This anonymous fellow saying that he is willing to sign a stat-dec, they are starting to  stack up, whether you like it or not. You have to acknowledge that.

TONY ABBOTT:

And, Karl, how seriously do you take people who aren’t prepared to put their names to a claim?

KARL STEFANOVIC:

So, what are you going to do about it? Are you just going to continue denying it and that’s it?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, I am saying it simply didn’t happen. It simply didn’t happen. There is one person’s recollection of  something that she said nothing about, on the record, for 35 years. That’s all there is. Now…

KARL STEFANOVIC:

Could it have happened but you don’t recollect it?

TONY ABBOTT:

Karl, it’s not like Barbara Ramjan hasn’t had plenty of opportunities to make these claims in the past. I  mean, I’ve been a public figure for years…

KARL STEFANOVIC:

You’ve got to answer that one for me. Could it have happened but you don’t recollect it?

TONY ABBOTT:

It did not happen. It did not happen. I have no recollection of it and how could I have a recollection of  something that simply didn’t happen?

KARL STEFANOVIC:

Alright, Tony. Good to talk to you and I’m sure you’re out and about now, there’s going to be plenty more  questions, lots to talk about. We didn’t get through a lot of the other stuff that I wanted to raise with you but  we appreciate your time as always.

TONY ABBOTT:

And Karl, the point is, the point is I am here running to become Prime Minister to build a better country and  all the Labor Party wants to talk about is some fiction from 35 years ago.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

Alright, Tony. Good to talk to you. Thanks for your time.

TONY ABBOTT:

Thanks, Karl.
