Opposition Slammed Over Collapse On Asylum-Seekers Bills

Mr Beazley, who yesterday criticized Mr Howard for making legislation on the run, is today running with him, Greens Senator Bob Brown said today.

Senator Brown condemned the Howard Government’s new package of bills to deter asylum seekers because it: Ã¢ÂÂ removes access to the courts (High Court excepted now) Ã¢ÂÂ introduces mandatory sentencing for the first time into federal legislation

Ã¢ÂÂ gives the minister power to regulate to excise from law all Australian islands - including Tasmania Ã¢ÂÂ makes retrospective any illegal action under Mr Ruddock’s direction since the Tampa incident began last month.

“These bills involve fundamental changes to the time-honoured basis of law in Australia. They deserve scrutiny by the legal profession and public before parliament decides.

“I will seek to refer the bills to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee to look at over the next 3 weeks, minimum.

“It is appalling that Labor has collapsed into timid bipartisanship with Mr Howard over this issue because an election is imminent,” Senator Brown said.
