TONY JONES:

Prime Minister thanks for joining us.

PRIME MINISTER:

Good to be with you.

TONY JONES:

Our Belgian Ambassador says that your claim that ISIS is using the refugee crisis to send operatives  into Europe was dangerous. He says it’s exactly what ISIS wants, confusion between terrorism and  migrants. Did you go too far in that speech?

PRIME MINISTER:

No.  My  job  as  the  Prime  Minister  of  Australia  is  to  explain  these  events  to  Australians  and in  particular  to  explain  the  context,  to  explain  where  there  are  similarities  and  where  there are  differences and there are very big differences between the security environment in Europe and  Australia. We have a much more successful multicultural society than many European countries.

TONY JONES:

Sure, but to go to Ambassador Bodson’s point, he was speaking specifically about your claim that  recent  intelligence  suggested  that  ISIS  was  infiltrating  people  into  Europe  among  the  refugees.   Is  that recent intelligence still hold? I mean you still stand by that?

PRIME MINISTER:

Well I don’t think anyone would seriously doubt what I said.

TONY JONES:

So he did obviously.  Seriously doubt it…

PRIME MINISTER:

I standby what I said. There is an enormous flood of refugees going into Europe and of course it is  very challenging for the Europeans. They have a serious, there is a very serious crisis, a humanitarian  crisis in Syria of course is of a scale not seen for many, many years. It is not entirely without  precedent of course but it is an extraordinary one. Millions of people fleeing that unhappy country,  many of them of course going into Europe. It strains the resources of the security services and the  border agencies in Europe. Of course they have the challenge that they do not have - because of the  Schengen arrangements - internal borders. So the, this makes managing security on a European  scale, a European wide scale, very difficult.

TONY JONES:

But you standby, essentially you standby the claim that ISIS is infiltrating terrorists into Europe  among those refugees?

PRIME MINISTER:

I can assure that everything I have said was carefully checked by our, by my security advisers.

TONY JONES:

Right. Since last year Canada has brought 25,000 Syrian refugees into their country. Is the fear of  importing terrorists part of the reason that of the 12,000 Syrian refugees that Australia is going to  take, only 26 have so far arrived in Australia?

PRIME MINISTER:

Well we are taking great care. We take security and border protection very seriously. Our agencies  are checking all of the security details, the antecedents and so forth of the Syrian intake. We are  expecting to take 12,000 additional refugees in addition to the already considerable humanitarian  intake Australia has already as part of our recurrent humanitarian intake, our regular intake.

TONY JONES:

Sure,  but  if,  specifically  on  that  question  is  the  fear  which  you  express  that  ISIS  is infiltrating  terrorists in refugees.

PRIME MINISTER:

Can I tell you it’s not a fear. We are not a-feared. We look at this in a very clear-eyed way. We  protect the security of Australians diligently and in a very realistic and pragmatic way and clearly  bringing people in from that environment demands that there be careful security checks whether  they are part of the 12,000 additional refugee places or the normal humanitarian intake and ASIO  and our other agencies, the AFP and so forth are taking great care in ensuring that those people who  come in are as far as we can ascertain not people that would pose any security risk to Australians.

We make no apology for that. My job as Prime Minister of Australia first and foremost is to keep  Australians safe.

TONY JONES:

Ok. New issues have risen today about one of the key players in your inner circle, your Cabinet  Secretary Arthur Sinodinos. The Electoral Commission has accused the NSW branch of the Liberal  Party of deliberately concealing the identity of major donors to the 2011 State election campaign.  Arthur Sinodinos was the finance director and the treasurer of the party in New South Wales at the  time. Are you certain that his hands are clean in this matter?

PRIME MINISTER:

Arthur  Sinodinos  has  written  today  to  the  Election  Funding  Authority  refuting  the  claims or  inferences made in their statement. I believe that his correspondence will be published if not by the  Election Funding Authority by the Senator, by Arthur Sinodinos. And there are obviously some issues  in  question.  But  can  I  just  say  this  to  you  Tony,  very  plainly,  as  I  said  earlier  today,   election  donations, political donations, whether they are made to a State division of the Liberal Party or the  Federal division, should all be disclosed in accordance with law. All of those donations should be  disclosed. This is related to a State election in 2011 and I note that Mike Baird has said precisely the  same thing, that all of those donations should be disclosed. I have no doubt that they will be.

TONY JONES:

You know that Labor is demanding that Senator Sinodinos be sacked or at least stood aside while  this matter is investigated. Your response to that?

PRIME MINISTER:

The Labor Party is always, whenever there is any adverse reflection on any Minister they demand  that they stand aside. However, its interesting isn’t it, that not withstanding the abundance of  evidence of the harassment, of the lawlessness, of the corruption, the bullying, the thuggery, in the  construction industry, notwithstanding the evidence of so many officials of the CFMEU before the  courts, the evidence of the Heydon Royal Commission, the clear, obvious need for a tough regulator  on the construction industry block, the Labor Party turns a blind eye to that mountain of evidence  and says they will not support the restoration of the building and construction commission.

TONY JONES:

Ok let’s talk about the evidence which is on the table today from the Electoral Commission. It says  the Free Enterprise Foundation was used by senior Liberals to channel and disguise hundreds of  thousands of dollars from political donors, including banned property developers. Can you  guarantee that Arthur Sinodinos did not know that banned donations were being funnelled through  the Free Enterprise Foundation to the Liberal Party?

PRIME MINISTER:

Well my understanding Tony is that Arthur Sinodinos had said that he was not aware and has done  so at the ICAC hearings at which he was a witness some time ago.

TONY JONES:

Are you assured that these kinds of practices are not going on because as it stands the New South  Wales Liberal Party will be taking donations for the federal election upcoming? Have you sought  guarantees they won’t be taking any elections - any donations - from sources which are  questionable?

PRIME MINISTER:

Well, of course, the Liberal Party should only take donations in accordance with the law and they  should disclose them in accordance with the law. The laws relating to donations are somewhat  different as between New South Wales for example, and federal jurisdiction. The disclosure limits  are higher than the federal level and there is no ban for example on property developers - for a  federal campaign. So there are differences and the laws are complex and that’s been a matter of  some criticism in the past. The complexity, of course, is an issue for administrators, but nonetheless  the fact is the party must comply with the law. If the law has not been complied with they should  fess up, set all the facts out on the table and let the cards fall where they may.

TONY JONES:

And if the law has not been complied with and Arthur Sinodinos was the treasurer of the party in  that period should he go?

PRIME MINISTER:

Well, I’m not going to get into a hypothetical situation there, Tony. The fact is…

TONY JONES:

That wasn’t particularly hypothetical.

PRIME MINISTER:

No, no - well it is hypothetical because…

TONY JONES:

Not according to what the electoral commission is saying because they’ve withheld $4.4 million in  public funding from the New South Wales Liberals, as well as future funding. That future funding  could affect presumably the federal election.

PRIME MINISTER:

Well, Tony, it is interesting to note that we spent a few minutes talking about national security and  the challenges faced by Europe in addressing or confronting Islamist extremism and you’re now  devoting much of the interview to the administration of the New South Wales division of the Liberal  Party in 2011.

TONY JONES:

No, I’m devoting some of the interview to talking about Arthur Sinodinos who was the treasurer of  the party at the time that these events took place. That’s all.

PRIME MINISTER:

Indeed. Okay.

TONY JONES:

Alright, you’ve made your point.

Are you going to change your slogan continuity and change now that you’ve realised how silly it is?

PRIME MINISTER:

Well, it’s not a slogan and I'm certainly I’m not into slogans.

TONY JONES:

Well, a slogan is a phrase used repeatedly. A short memorable phrase used in political campaigning.  So, I’d have to say it is a slogan because you used it repeatedly.

PRIME MINISTER:

No, I’ve not used that slogan. I’ve subsequently learned that there was a slogan used in the  American sitcom 'Veep' - change with continuity or continuity with change.

TONY JONES:

Which they chose incidentally because it was the most meaningless election slogan they could think  of. Does this reflect on your own choices?

PRIME MINISTER:

Well, it really reflects on your choices that we’ve spent so little time on national security and now  we’re talking about an American sitcom. But let me…

TONY JONES:

Actually as a matter of fact you raised the American sitcom.

PRIME MINISTER:

Yeah, well that was where you were heading. Let me just make this point, Tony. The point that I  made was in respect of questions about Mr Abbott and myself and I made the point that when there  is a change of prime minister - and in fact this applies even when there’s a change of government,  from one party to another. There are policies that continue, so there is continuity and there are  policies that change. And that is a fact. That is not a slogan. It is a fact. And that is true whether the  change is from, when the change is from, you know, for example there is broadly very strong  bipartisan commitment to our major pillars of our foreign policy. So whether you have a Labor  government or a Liberal government, there is broadly speaking continuity there, but there will be  changes in other areas.

TONY JONES:

But can we ask the question why you were forced to use this particular phrase or slogan. It was in  response to Tony Abbott’s repeated claim that you’d be campaigning on the achievements of the  Abbott government. In a long campaign, how are you going to deal with the ghost of governments  past?

PRIME MINISTER:

Well, I think Australians are not very interested - other than yourself of course - in the ghosts of  government past.

TONY JONES:

Well, other than myself and Tony Abbott and Tony Abbott’s supporters on your backbench.

PRIME MINISTER:

What Australians are interested in is the prospect of the future government. What they want to  know is who is best able to manage Australia’s economy. Who is best able to lead our transition  from an economy that was fuelled by a mining construction boom to one that is more diverse, that is  grounded in innovation, in enterprise, in entrepreneurship, in investment and in taking advantage of  the opening up of these extraordinary markets in east Asia - the pace of growth there is  unprecedented both in the pace of the growth - the speed and the scale. Now, every measure of our  economic plan, every element in it, is devoted to ensuring that we are best able to seize those  opportunities and so it is economic leadership that will be the key question in the election.

TONY JONES:

But in any election campaign there’s tremendous interest in what happens behind the scenes and  not only behind the scenes but on television. When Tony Abbott came forward and said what he  said, it raised the question whether he’s in a sense playing Kevin Rudd to your Julia Gillard. Whether  you could end up facing that same kind of psycho-drama that played out during the 2010 election;  whether he could undermine your support over a period of time - isn’t that a concern?

PRIME MINISTER:

No, the Australian people are concerned about who can best ensure that their children and  grandchildren will have great, well-paid jobs in the future. They’re concerned about the choice  between me and Bill Shorten. That’s the choice that will face Australians at the election.

TONY JONES:

But have you got an assurance yet from Tony Abbott that he won’t interfere in the campaign since  he’s already done it on day one?

PRIME MINISTER:

Tony, my focus is on leadership - on economic leadership in this context. Obviously there are many  other areas of leadership too. National security, it’s been very much in our minds in the wake of the  events in Brussels. But in terms of the election, the really big question is going to be: Who is best  able to lead Australia in economic terms? Who is best able to manage that transition? Who’s best  able to promote investment and jobs? And you know everything we’re doing is promoting

investment; the Labor Party on the other hand is increasing the tax on investment. Now, if you want  people to do less of something you raise the tax on it. We put up the tax on cigarettes and when we  do that we do that so people smoke less.

TONY JONES:

I understand that the whole issue of the Labor Party will be fought out during the campaign. But in  campaigns disunity is death and now you’ve evidently got ministerial colleagues or some colleagues  within the Ministry leaking stories to The Australian. The latest one this morning is that you gave the  Treasurer a dressing down in front of the Cabinet colleagues at a dinner at the Lodge over his  handling of the GST debate. What’s your message to the leakers who are putting these stories out  there?

PRIME MINISTER:

Well Tony the fact of the matter is that this is of great interest to you, just as Tony Abbott is of great  interest to you, but the matter that is of interest to me and to my colleagues in the Cabinet and to  the Australian people is the economic future of this country.

TONY JONES:

No, well with all due respect the relationship between you and the Treasurer, who’s about to deliver  a budget, is very interesting to everybody who follows politics. And so the question is, what is your  message to the leakers who said there’s a good deal of tension between you and Mr Morrison and it  was played out at the dinner at the Lodge and now people are talking about it and it’s in the  newspapers.

PRIME MINISTER:

Well Tony, I don’t discuss what happens in Cabinet Meetings or Cabinet Dinners full stop. But let me  tell you, my relationship with the Treasurer is very, very close. We have been close friends and  colleagues for the best part of twenty years. We were on the phone at length this morning - only  this morning when I was heading down to the South Coast talking about, naturally, the contents of  the budget. We are in constant dialogue and co-operation and collaboration. Our offices are working  together constantly. Our bureaucrats are working together constantly. It is a very tight team I can  assure you.

TONY JONES:

So what about those who aren’t tight who are leaking to The Australian, then who are still obviously  in the centre…

PRIME MINISTER:

Well you’re assuming that the reports are true. I’m not going to comment on whether they are or  not.  I  do  not,  my  Cabinet  has  been  noted  for  very,  for  few  if  any  leaks.  Certainly  no   leaks of  substance and the fact is that we, I believe that the business of government is best managed when  Cabinet colleagues confer in private, confidentially. Have open discussions. Have strong  discussions.

Disagree, argue, chuck ideas around and then come to a decision and then and only then make a  public statement.

TONY JONES:

Alright, let’s move to policy. Would you agree as a matter of principle that if you’re going to make  tax cuts in the budget, if you are, that you have to find savings measures to pay for them?

PRIME MINISTER:

Well you, if you are going to make, yes, unless you want to increase, unless you want to borrow the  money. Yes of course, if you’re going to, if you wanted to cut one tax without, while keeping your  net  position  the  same  you  would  obviously  have  to  raise  revenue  somewhere  else  or  you   would  have to cut expenditure somewhere else.

TONY JONES:

So if, for example, the company tax was to be cut by 1.5% that’s estimated to cost the budget $9  billion, that’s about right isn’t it?

PRIME MINISTER:

Well you’re welcome to make these estimates but I’m not going to comment on the contents of the  budget it will be out soon enough on the 3rd of May and this is budget speculation is an annual virus,  an annual fever that affects everyone and you’re entitled to --

TONY JONES:

Well you know…

PRIME MINISTER:

You’re entitled to be afflicted by it but I’m not going to respond.

TONY JONES:

You know that same senior cabinet colleague Arthur Sinodinos fuelled the speculation himself on  the Insiders so obviously you think we’re going to be talking about it.

PRIME MINISTER:

Well  I  actually  don’t  agree  with  that.  I  watched  that  interview.  I  thought  what  Arthur   said about  what he talked about company tax and the growth dividend that economists argue is delivered by  reductions in company tax for all the obvious reasons, it delivers a high return on capital. So for  precicsely  the  same  reasons  I  was  referring  to  earlier  you  will  get  more  investment  and more  investment delivers more economic activity, more jobs and so forth.

TONY JONES:

I know you can’t talk specifically about the budget measures but it just so happens there’s about $9  billion worth of budget savings measures legislated and then rejected by the Senate crossbench. Will  the tax cuts - if there are any - be contingent on getting through those measures which are stuck in  the Senate?

PRIME MINISTER:

These are things which you should speculate about with an economist. You see the difficulty that I  have is that in terms of answering your questions is that I have a pretty good idea of what is going to  be in the budget and so the less I say about its contents or the less I say that could be - from which  people could draw deductions which may actually be wrong about its contents, the better - so we’ll  just have to wait until the 3rd  of May.

TONY JONES:

But here’s some of the biggest of those measures held up by the crossbenchers. Co-payment on PBS  subsidised medicines, changes to family payments, removal of so called double dipping from paid  parental leave, increasing the age you can access Newstart payments and on and on. Is part of the  dividend of changing Senate reform that you might end up controlling the Senate and will that give  you the chance to put all those held up measures through?

PRIME MINISTER:

Well let me, I’ll answer part of that question. I’m not going to buy into the contents of the budget  and I hope you understand why. In terms of the Senate voting reforms the only winner out of those,  Tony, is going to be the Australian public. Voters will determine where their preferences go as  opposed to preference whisperers and these often quite elaborate, bizarrely elaborate backroom  deals that had the results in the last Senate election which appalled so many Australians. So voters  and democracy will be the winner. Will the Liberal Party and the Nationals win a majority in the  Senate? I think that it is almost impossible, certainly highly, highly unlikely. My prediction would be  that  there  will  be  the  Labor  Party  and  the  Coalition  will  have  a  substantial  delegation  each, the  Greens will have a substantial delegation and there will be a number of larger independents in the  middle. But whether they are independents or Greens or Labor or Liberal or National, they will all be  there because Australians made a deliberate choice to vote for them. Not because some preference  whisperer you know, gathered all these preferences and out came the result.

TONY JONES:

You’ve got to go so I’ll just throw one final question at you, which is related to this.

PRIME MINISTER:

One final barb!

TONY JONES:

Well in fact there were two elements of that legislation that you ruled out taking back to the Senate  yesterday.  That  is  a  scrapping  of  the  Clean  Energy  Finance  Corporation  and  ARENA.  Was  that

another part of distancing yourself, your government from the Tony Abbott government which  wanted to scrap both of those agencies?

PRIME MINISTER:

No, it’s a good, it’s a very good decision. The Cabinet made the decision this week as you know. Greg  Hunt has made this proposal as the Environment Minister quite some time ago. This has been a long  time in the works and it’s very consistent with my philosophy which is that we should be - where we  are investing and government’s use the term ‘invest’ advisedly. When we are investing, rather than  making grants where you just, essentially the Commonwealth government is like an ATM - we should  be seeking to get a financial return. Now it can be a very modest one. Just might just be a few  percent that enables us to keep it on our books as a balance sheet item. But that creates much  greater discipline, means you get much better projects, much better, mucha more scrutiny by public  servants so what we’re doing is committing substantial sums. You saw a billion dollars in the clean  energy innovation fund to innovation but it will be invested on the basis that it will deliver a return.  Now the hurdle rate is very low and every investment banker or banker or venture capital fund  would be appalled by it. The government doesn’t have to compete with the private sector there  but  I think the discipline of actually having to say how are we going to get a real return, albeit very  modest, will result in a better outcome, better quality investments, better quality projects and that’s  the approach we’re taking to the cities policy as well. That is very much my rather more businesslike  approach to government investment and government spending than perhaps others may have had  in the past.

TONY JONES:

Prime Minister we’ve been given the wrap up you’ve got to go to another event and we thank you  very much for joining us on Lateline.

PRIME MINISTER:

Thank you very much.
