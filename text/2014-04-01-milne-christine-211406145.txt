'WA election: Only the Greens can make the Senate work'  National Press Club Address, 1 April 2014  Senator Christine Milne, Leader of the Australian Greens



I begin by acknowledging the Ngunnawal and Ngambri peoples the traditional

owners of the land on which we meet and acknowledge their elders past and

present.



And in doing so, I commit to the constitutional recognition of our Aboriginal

and Torres Strait Islander people and reject immediately any question over the

need to retain aboriginal history as part of our curriculum. Can you believe it,

we have a national effort to close the gap between aboriginal health,

education, life expectancy and the wider community and, at the same time, a

Government that is set to remove indigenous history from our classrooms,

abandon the Gonski education reforms which direct funding to the children

most in need and repeal laws that protect people from racial abuse.



It is any wonder people are asking “What on Earth is going on?”



One of the most loved lines to make it into our collective culture in recent

decades was from the classic Aussie film, The Castle,



“ it’s the constitution, it’s Mabo, it’s justice, it’s law, it’s the vibe,

and…no that’s it…it’s the vibe. I rest my case.”



And that is what I am here at the Press Club to explore today as Western

Australia goes back to the polls in an historic Senate by-election. The vibe.



The vibe of the nation right now is something you can't quite put your finger

on but it's there, it's real, it's powerful, and it's building.



It is manifest in the thousands who gathered at the March in March rallies.



It’s in the 850,000 people who have watched our WA candidate Greens

Senator Scott Ludlam’s inspiring speech to the Senate admonishing Prime

Minister Abbott for his hollow three word slogans and the intolerance,

discrimination and climate denialism embedded in them.



It's in the conversations I have been having in offices, on the streets, in

markets, taxis and hospitals. People are telling me they are despairing, how

they have stopped reading papers, or listening to the news because they can't

stand what the Abbott Government is doing to our country and the speed with

which it's doing it.

It's there in the thousands who are standing up against coal seam gas and for

farmers right to say no; it's there in the hearts of millions who have woken up

today feeling good that the ICJ has ruled to stop Japanese whaling, but

distraught by what’s coming with climate change, and it's there in the laughter

and ridicule of the millions who now see Tony Abbott with his knights and

dames and climate denial as yesterday's man.



The vibe is manifest in the reaction to the call for door knockers and campaign

volunteers for the Greens in WA. More than 27 000 doors have been knocked

on and 30 000 phone calls have been made by hundreds Greens volunteers,

with more to come in the lead up to Saturday. These are people who care

about our country, who know what defines us as a nation is hanging in the

balance in this period of government.  These are people who are committed to

taking strong immediate action to address climate change. I know you are

there in Perth today with Senator Scott Ludlam and Senator Rachel Siewert

and I say go for it!



It's to all of you and to the thousands of others sitting at home genuinely

worried about the way Australia is going that I am appealing today.



Don't give up, don't despair. Instead, as German poet Bertolt Brecht said,

“don’t start with the good old things but the bad new ones.”  Get active and

help bring home the vibe to the heart of the Parliament, to the Senate. Make

the WA election the turning of the tide; make it the defining moment where

Tony Abbott's radical, extreme agenda is stopped. Make it the moment, as

Scott Ludlam said, “when we take our country back”.



In the seven months since the election there has been a wholesale assault on

Australian values.  We’re starting to see Tony Abbott's real agenda unfolding.

Things that people regarded as certainties, like our rights and our values, are

being trampled.



First is love of country, our natural places that are too precious to lose. Abbott

and his Government are there for the big end of town tearing up environment

protection in the name of getting rid of red tape.



Wherever we live, we all love the Great Barrier Reef, now under pressure as

never before, from the consequences of climate change and coal mining. Our

Reef is dying as Tony Abbott gives the tick to the dumping of dredging spoil

from Abbott's Point coal terminal; adding to pollution from Clive Palmer’s

nickel refinery and agricultural runoff, on top of the coral bleaching and

acidification from warming seas heated by burning the very coal we are digging

5



up.



Tasmania's magnificent high conservation forests listed in 2013 as World

Heritage are to be delisted and logged if Abbott has his way, in addition to high

country grazing in Victoria's National Parks, and shooting in NSW and now

considered ok for WA's national parks. Shocking but hardly surprising as our

Prime Minister has said that "the environment is meant for man", an insight

into Tony Abbott's Old Testament, Bob Santamaria philosophical view.



Farmers and rural communities across Australia continue to be pushed aside

by the Abbott Government for coal mines, coal seam gas and non-conventional

gas regardless of the contamination of ground water supplies.



Tony Abbott is delivering for big mining companies and his big business mates,

sending the profits of the big three iron ore miners (RIO, BHP, Fortesque

Metals) soaring with collective half yearly profits of more than $US14 billion

from their West Australian iron ore mines.



All this made worse by Tony Abbott handing back environmental oversight

powers to state premiers, like Colin Barnett whose Government has a proven

record of conflicts of interest in approving destructive developments like

James Price Point and whose cruel drum lines are killing sharks as I speak. It

has to stop.



Another value under assault by Abbott’s cruel, secret and tricky Government is

our love for our community and our belief in decency and respect in the way

we treat each other. Australians do think of ourselves as decent,

compassionate people who will help one another out in hard times.



Reza Berati's murder on Manus Island was a line in the sand.



Things have gone too far. The secrecy, driven by Scott Morrison’s refusal to

allow lawyers and journalists onto Manus Island, on top of cruel failures to

investigate claims of maltreatment by the armed forces, the removal of legal

support services, and news today that the AFP has refused to send officers to

help interview suspects in Reza Berati’s murder has deepened misgivings that

there is a shocking “cover up” going on.



Australia's refusal to support a UN war crimes investigation in Sri Lanka and

not to hold an authoritarian regime to account for war crimes and crimes

against humanity is wrong.  Forcibly returning more than 1000 asylum seekers

to Sri Lanka in the past two years, exposing them to continued persecution,

and gifting two patrol boats to boost its anti-people smuggling capability

7



shames our nation.  We are becoming a global pariah in Human Rights,

environment, and climate and now relations with Indonesia are at an all-time

low.



People are beginning to be frightened of a reckless, cruel, out of touch

government, and a maverick PM. They're asking where are we headed as a

nation? Are we headed back to the 1950s era of racist, anti-gay Australia

where women were treated as second class citizens, where LGBTI people hid,

where abusive racist name calling was ok, an era dominated by “old rich white

men” born to rule, as Mona Eltahawy said on Q&A last night, who wanted to

be knights in a colonial aristocracy looking to London.



We have a Government with its head buried in the 19th and 20th centuries

without a plan for the nation in the 21st century.



With no plan for the future, Tony Abbott will fail as Prime Minister.



No one can lead at this moment without a plan to address global warming. It is

a defining characteristic of leadership to identify the risks and threats to the

nation and lead people to address them. The IPPC has made it clear. Time has

run out, we are suffering already and are on track for 4 degrees of warming

and we are not prepared.  The Greens are the only party in the Australian

Parliament who recognise the two possible futures, as the IPCC has said:



“one of inaction and degradation of our environment, our economies, and our

social fabric.  The other, to seize the moment and the opportunities for

managing climate change risks and making transformational changes that

catalyses more adaptive and resilient societies where new technologies and

ways of living open the door to a myriad of health, prosperity and job-

generating benefits.  The path of tomorrow is undoubtedly determined by our

choices today.  We must decide which path to follow.”



The Greens have chosen the future of transformational change - the

Government has not.



Nowhere is this lack of a plan for a climate change dominated future more

obvious than in WA.



Yesterday’s report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change

emphasised the enormity of the global task to avoid climate. In WA, the south

west of the state is drying out, and Perth recently recorded its second hottest

summer on record and sweltered through their hottest night on record ever, at

29.7 degrees, life will get harder with more heatwaves and extreme fire danger

days resulting in loss of life and reduced productivity.

Tony Abbott is a fool to pretend climate change is not happening and even

more foolish to try to prevent action that would help people, create jobs and

create a future for WA, and the country, after the mining boom.



People around the nation are worried that they already work hard yet things

are getting tougher. People are worried about everything from casualised jobs,

long commutes to work, congestion, fly in fly out, too little time with their

families and anxiety about the future as construction gives way to production

and lost jobs.



In WA people without work or who are underemployed worry that they won't

be able to afford to rent a place to live and see the waiting lists for crisis

accommodation blowing out. WA has one of the least affordable and most

pressured housing markets in the whole world.



Two weeks ago, I visited Foyer Oxford in Perth, which has the capacity to

house up to 98 young people, including 24 young parents and their children.

The youth I spoke to who are living there think it is awesome but the service

providers are left high and dry with no guarantee of a new partnership

agreement on homelessness. Abbott’s last minute stop gap measures on the

weekend do not provide the certainty of funding over the forward estimates

which is needed and could be viewed as a cynical exercise to neutralise the

issue before this Saturday’s poll.



Abbott says, trust me, but why should they when so much of what he says is

hot air. People’s gut instinct is telling them something is not right. When a PM

says only to believe it when it’s written down, and even then it is still

negotiable.



Trust your gut instinct fellow Australians. Don’t trust Prime Minister Abbott to

deliver for you.



The Abbott Government is not governing for all Australians. He is governing for

the greedy few, the vested interests of yesteryear, not the Australia of

tomorrow, like a CEO delivering for only one division of his company.



Make no mistake this is the Abbott, Murdoch, Rinehart collaboration directed

and promoted by the Institute of Public Affairs. Abbott said in April 2013, “that

is a big “yes” to many of the specific policies you urged upon me” referring to

the  IPA’s 75 radical ideas to Transform Australia which are being delivered so

fast that they’ve had to add another 25. Do we really want to live in an

Australia fashioned by Rupert Murdoch, Gina Rinehart and a forelock tugging

Prime Minister?

Take the big four banks and what they stand to gain from the Future of

Financial Reforms for example.  Give a few political donations, and what do

you get? - “to not act in the best interest of the client.”



The Financial Services Council has donated over $42,000 to the major parties

over the last few years.



Take the mining tax as another example. Abbott is governing for the wealthy,

billionaires, and overseas mining companies and letting every day Australians

take the hit.  Joe Hockey said “ everyone in Australia has to help to do the

heavy lifting on the Budget” - everyone except the big miners and polluters

who benefit from fossil fuel subsidies, polluting for free and maximising profits.



If “everyone has to take a hit” Joe Hockey, then release the Commission of

Audit now!



Two decades of unprecedented boom and what do we have to show for it?

The mining boom is being squandered. Seven in ten WA voters don’t feel Tony

Abbott has a plan for new jobs in Western Australia in light of the mining boom

slowing, and they’re right.



If Abbott repeals the mining tax, he will strip 353,613 Western Australians of

around $27,000 of retirement income by repealing the low income

superannuation guarantee.



If you want to create jobs in Australia the best way to do it is to fix the mining

tax so it does raise revenue for all Australians and use the income to create the

Australia of tomorrow.



So where does this leave Australia with a new Senate due to take office in just

a few months? A Senate in which the Government will have to rely on an

inexperienced, uncertain, and policy free few.



At last year's election the community voted against the incumbent

government. People voted, as Rupert Murdoch railed, to ‘kick this mob out’.



Rather than voting ‘for’ what Abbott offered, they voted against the Rudd-

Gillard-Slipper-Thomson spectacle.  That showed up clearly in the Senate vote.



Having voted Liberal in the House of Representatives, people wanted

insurance against Abbott getting total control of the Parliament. What the 25%

of the population didn't and couldn't have known was how voting for a raft of

13



micro parties would play out. Instead of stopping the Abbott Government

getting total control, the gaming of the electoral system made the Senate and

the nation vulnerable to the very thing people voted to avoid.



Australia is now subject to the whims of people who secured less than 1% of

the vote and who will be tempted to give Abbott everything he wants in

exchange for who knows what?



The Senate crossbench is now a right-wing circus. Even before the results of

the WA election are known, we have:



One from the Australian Motoring Enthusiast Party who will want  four

wheel drive vehicles in our national parks and precious environmental

areas and who has signed secret MOU with mining millionaire Clive

Palmer - what’s the deal - did money change hands, and for what?



One from the Liberal Democrats who benefitted from the donkey vote

and who left the Liberal Party because he was opposed to John Howard's

crackdown on guns following the Port Arthur massacre



One from Family First who will oppose every effort to achieve marriage

equality.



Two unreliable, unpredictable Palmer United Political Party Senators

who are there for Clive, not for the community - one says one thing,

Clive says another.



The numbers in the Senate matter and will determine whether Prime Minister

Abbott and the conservatives get absolute control.



If the voters of Western Australia don’t risk their vote on a micro party and this

Saturday’s election returns 3 Liberals, 2 ALP and 1 Green then WA has changed

the ledger. One vote will have shifted from the conservatives to the

progressives.



It is this one vote, this one seat that makes this by-election so important and

it's why Western Australia has the chance to change the direction of the

nation.



There has never been a more timely election or one with such clarity about

what outcomes can be delivered. One very live example of transferring one

seat from the conservative side of politics to the progressive side is fate of the

Clean Energy Finance Corporation. With the Greens, the ALP, Senators

Madigan and Xenophon committed to retaining the $14.9 billion worth of

15



investment in 179 renewable energy projects if WA returns 3 Liberals, 2 ALP

and 1 Green, then this investment and all the jobs which go with it is saved. It’s

as simple as that. Who WA votes for really matters.



Clive Palmer has declared his conflict of interest in carbon pricing. His company

owes $8.4 million under the Clean Energy Package, with the potential for the

penalty interest of $35.8million.  In fact he has said that he wants the price

retrospectively repealed so that his company does not have to pay.



Where does this coal billionaire's conflict of interest leave his two senators and

where does it leave all the other companies who have abided by the law?

Surely his two senators cannot vote to personally and directly financially

advantage the Leader of their political party to the tune of $8.4 million. If it's

good enough for him to abstain in the House, then it is good enough for them

to abstain in the Senate. Otherwise the precedent is for corporations to use

their profits to have their representatives directly elected to Parliament to

change laws that adversely affect them. Forget the national interest. It is

democracy for sale.



Abbott does not have the skills to handle an unstable cross bench. It will be a

crossbench which will put the last minority government in the shade. And this

will be Tony Abbott’s undoing. The Prime Minister’s strategy has always been

to crash through but he will just crash because he simply doesn’t have the

leadership skills to negotiate with the Senate he cannot avoid.  He didn’t tell

his own party about his knights and dames, how is he going to keep his word?



That's where the Greens Plan fits in. Only the Greens can make the Senate

work after July this year. We have done it before and we will do it again.   We

have a long history of responsible delivery; from the climate change package to

Denticare to Parliamentary Budget Office.



Why the Greens, and not Labor or any of the other micro parties?



Three reasons.



Ã¯ÂÂ· The Greens are a party with a full suite of economically credible, costed

policies. We’re not it in to repeal economic policies for our own personal

financial benefit or who knows what.



Ã¯ÂÂ· Our agendas and values are clear and voters can trust us to stand by

them



Ã¯ÂÂ· Our holistic vision for a caring nation supported by a healthy

environment in a rapidly warming world is one that will make

Australians lives easier, not harder.



17



The Greens are the only party who voters can trust to stand up to Abbott's

harsh agenda, without question.



The Greens are the only party with a vision for the future and we will work

hard to deliver it.



We have a credible, exciting plan designed for the future, designed to deliver

for people after the boom. We want to build 214, 00 new homes, affordable

rental homes, including more than 21, 000 in WA. I am delighted that the

Planning Institute of Australia awarded Scott Ludlam their prize for because of

his excellent work creating a vision for the city of Perth from public transport

to better more accessible housing. Just goes to show that Scott Ludlam is too

precious to WA and the country, as well as the Greens, to lose.



We want to fix the mining tax, end the corporate welfare.  We want people to

pay less for their power, and solar can do it!



Scott Ludlam’s energy plan for WA demonstrates that his home state can be

powered by 100% renewable energy by 2029 for the same costs as business as

usual and, create 26,000 jobs.



We have a plan for the future and we can be relied upon to deliver in the

community's best interests.



Not for us is the corporate self-interest, or delivering for vested interests or

mates at the IPA.



Not for us is the blast from the past, the knighthoods and boards and trappings

of office.



Not for us is the trade-off for more four wheel drives or shooters in national

parks.



That is what you get if you vote for parties that have no policies for the nation.



This election offers WA the chance to vote for a future which takes the science

of climate change into account, delivers billions of dollars and jobs in

renewable energy, public transport, housing and education, saves money on

power bills by supporting solar and gives hope and the promise of happiness to

this and the next generation by standing up for people and the environment in

the face of the biggest power grab for the greedy seen in generations.



If you’re feeling the “vibe” Vote Green!
