CHILDREN IN IMMIGRATION DETENTION CENTRES

I today appeal to Coalition MPs to join with other Australians in supporting the release of children from behind the razor wire of Australia’s immigration detention centres.

Failure to act on this matter may put at risk the psychological and emotional, if not the physical, wellbeing of these children.

Nearly 600 children are being held in detention, about 50 of whom are unaccompanied by a close family member.

The ongoing events of the last week have demonstrated to all Australians that, regardless of one’s attitude to the policy of mandatory detention, these centres are no place for children.

In this context, I am pleased that a number of community and other organisations have welcomed Labor’s proposals to try and remove children from Australia’s immigration detention centres.

Labor looks forward to working with these organisations to further develop and advocate these proposals.

I also welcome the fact that Immigration Minister Phillip Ruddock yesterday acknowledged on the ABC’s AM program that there is a role to play for these proposals, in particular Labor’s proposals to:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Foster unaccompanied children with suitable families; and

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Allow children and their mothers to be released from immigration detention centres into ordinary style housing under appropriate supervision.

However, the Government is yet to indicate how it will implement these proposals on anything other than an ad hoc or trial basis.

The Minister is also yet to comment on Labor’s two other proposals, which would:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Separate accompanied children and their families for whom some form of closer supervision is required from other asylum seekers and house these families in more appropriate conditions; and

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Provide greater streaming of people in detention centres so that the higher level of security for the small number of troublemakers is not imposed on peaceful and co-operative asylum seekers.

The first of these two proposals is consistent with a bipartisan recommendation contained in the June 2001 report on Visits to immigration detention centres of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration (Recommendation 13).

That said, Monday’s comments by the Minister are a welcome shift from his statement on Saturday.

On Saturday, the Minister alleged that Labor’s proposals could give rise to problems similar to those experienced by Australia’s ‘stolen generations’.

This was both offensive and wrong.

As the Minister himself has now acknowledged, Labor’s proposal would allow the continuation, expansion and improvement of a trial already being undertaken by his own Government.

Under Labor’s proposal, a parent or close family member would accompany the child at all times and would have regular access to any other parent or close family member required to remain under closer supervision.

The proposal is consistent with the recommendation from both Coalition and Labor MPs contained in the June 2001 report of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration (Recommendation 9).

It is true that some families may prefer to remain together - even in detention - and of course Labor would not force them to separate.  Mr Ruddock should now be looking at ways to expand and improve the current trial.

No one pretends that these are easy issues to resolve.

But when it comes to the welfare of innocent children we must try harder.

I again urge the Government to consider these proposals and to work with Labor and the community to find lasting, workable solutions that are in the best interests of these innocent children.
