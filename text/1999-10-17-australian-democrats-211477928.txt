Democrats urge Labor to take a closer look 
at hidden costs of Ruddock’s new Immigration plans

Â

The Coalition’s newly announced changes to proc edures for 
asylum seekers have the potential to be a lawyers’ picnic, doing little 
to prevent people smuggling whilst increasing the suffering of genuine 
asylum seekers, according to the Australian Democrats.

Â

This week, immigration Minister Ruddock announced 
tough new measures against asylum-seekers, including a proposal to give 
unauthorised arrivals who are found to be genuine refugees, a three 
year temporary protection visa rather than permanent haven.

Â

“After three years here, refugees will have to undergo 
the same process all over again to determine if their status is still 
the same. This will mean duplication in costs, procedures and more work 
for lawyers,” said Senator Andrew Bartlett, the Australian Democrats’ 
spokesperson on immigration.

Â

Senator Bartlett urged the ALP spokesperson, Con Sciacca, 
to examine the potential impact of the proposed changes more closely 
before agreeing to support.

Â

Mr Sciacca has said the Labor Party “generally welcomes 
the new measures” and “is as tough on the government on illegal 
immigration”.

Â

“Labor may want to look tough on illegal immigration, 
but Mr Sciacca should think carefully before supporting something that 
may well make life (and death) a hell of a lot tougher for genuine refugees 
and asylum seekers.

Â

Senator Bartlett warned that, while some of the new 
measures may seem reasonable on the surface, the potential for them 
to cause extra suffering for many people had to be closely considered.

Â

“The concept of temporary asylum is not new. It 
was tried in 1990 and lasted until 1995. It was discontinued because 
it was found to be an inappropriate method of dealing with the issue 
of illegal entries,” said Senator Bartlett.

Â

“Treating refugees as “temporary visitors” is 
a One Nation policy and an appalling proposal following so closely on 
National Refugee Week which celebrates the contribution refugees make 
to Australia.

Â

“Minister Ruddock disapproves of refugees who apply 
for protection once they are in Australia. He has his own definition 
that a genuine refugee is someone who is not in the country and he seems 
determined to act independently of the legal definition,” said Senator 
Bartlett.

Â

“The fact is that around 80% of those who enter 
Australia before seeking asylum are granted refugee status. They are 
under a significant risk in their homelands and are entitled to protection.

Â

“While we support measures to halt the trade in 
people-trafficking, the Minister is targeting people .who are genuine 
refugees. His answer to the problem of people smuggling is to target 
these genuine refugees who are living a life of uncertainty and increase 
their trauma by continuing the uncertainty,” concluded Senator Bartlett.
