REFUGEE BOAT SIGHTED

The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Af fairs,  -the Hon

M.J.R. MacKellar, M.P. said today he was concerned that people

fleeing from Vietnam should continue to attempt the long and

perilous voyage to Australia in small unseaworthy boats.

These desperate measures were no longer necessary.

Mr. MacKellar was commenting on the sighting today by

a naval coastal surveillance air-craft of a refugee vessel

about 240 kilometres north west of Darwin.

The vessel which is reported to have about one hundred

people on board is expected to arrive at Darwin at 8 a.m.

on 9 April. A naval patrol boat left Darwin earlier today

to intercept and escort the vessel to Australian waters.

Australia together with U.S.A. France, Canada, New Zealand

and a number of European countries was operating a resettleÂ­

ment program based on orderly processing of refugees out of

camps of first refuge in the region. Groups such as this

should have waited their turn.

Mr. MacKellar said that in accordance with Australia's

strict quarantine and health procedures the group would be held

for detailed checking and interview before a decision could be

taken on their future.
