15th June, 1967.

MIDDLE EAST

The Minister for External Affairs (Mr Paul Hasluck)

said today' .that the Australian Government was continuing

to keep in close touch with developments in the Middle East and

in the United Nations.

The cease-fire had been an important achievement, but

many complicated political problems now demanded attention. In

addition, there were pressing humanitarian issues: there were

greatly increased numbers of refugees and much suffering among

civilians and soldiers in the areas where hostilities had occurred.

Sympathy for suffering should know no political bounds, and all countries

of the world shared a common concern at the distress of fellow human-beings, Arab and Israeli alike. Already international agencies were

giving attention to what could be done to give relief. This was to

be encouraged and should be pressed on with without delay.
