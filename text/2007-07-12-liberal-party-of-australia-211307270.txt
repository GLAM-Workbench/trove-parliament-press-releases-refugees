Labor still refuses to get tough on people smugglers

Thursday, 12 July 2007

Kevin Rudd’s claim today that Labor would process illegal boat people in the  ‘normal way’ is simply more evidence that Labor is soft on people smuggling  and protecting Australia’s borders.

When asked by Alan Jones what Labor would do if a boatload of people from  Indonesia or somewhere else were waiting out in the ocean to come in to  Australia Mr Rudd said:

Well, under those circumstances they’d be processed in the normal way and  probably taken to Christmas Island for processing purposes. (Alan Jones,  2GB 12/07/07)

When Mr Rudd says that they will be processed in the ‘normal way’, is he  saying that illegal arrivals will be brought into Australia just like any other  person?

Labor has previously stated that if people smugglers make it to Christmas  Island then entry to the mainland is guaranteed. They have also promised to  close the detention centre on Nauru.

This will give the green light to people smugglers that their criminal activity will  be tolerated by a Rudd Labor Government.
