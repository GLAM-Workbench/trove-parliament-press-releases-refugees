CHRISTOPHER PYNE:

Mr  Anthony Albanese  last  night  was  photographed  drinking  beer  with  Craig  Thomson,   the Member for Dobell in Sydney. He needs to explain what they were discussing at that  meeting because if they were discussing deals, post the election for Mr Thomson’s vote  in a hung parliament then again what we are seeing is that Labor will do anything to cling  to power. They’ll always put themselves first, there’s nowhere they won’t go in order to  hang onto power. He could have been discussing the legal case involving Sam Dastyari  and Chris McArdle, who is Craig Thomson’s lawyer and the claims being made by Craig  Thomson’s lawyer that Sam Dastyari promised to pay $35 000 to him. They could have  been  discussing  whether  Craig  Thomson  should  clear  the  path  in  Dobell  for  Labor’s   candidate. But the most important thing that Mr Albanese needs to clear up is, were they  discussing the outcome of a hung parliament and Mr Thomson’s vote, securing his vote if  he wins Dobell in a hung parliament. Because what that will prove to the Australia public  is yet again Labor is busy doing deals, preparing for a hung parliament, prepared to put  themselves first and that the only clear choice is to vote for a Liberal National candidates  in the area in which people live in order to have a clear choice in what is one of the most  important elections in a generation.

QUESTION:

So  the  Coalition  can  guarantee  that  they  will  not  meet  with  any  of  the  independents  between  now  and  the  election.  No  member  of  the  Coalition,  no  matter  how  casual  will   ever meet with any independents.



CHRISTOPHER PYNE:

Our plan is to win the independents seats from them, with our candidates. So we won’t be  meeting with the independents over a beer at the Belgian Beer CafÃÂ© in Sydney to discuss  legal  fees,  or  campaigning  in  Dobell  or  the  event  of  a  hung  parliament  and  securing   independents’  votes.  What  we  need  to  be  doing  in  these  next  four  and  a  half  weeks  is   telling  the  Australian  people  why  they  need  to  change  the  government  to  restore  job   Security, to protect our borders, economic management and reduce the burden on cost of  living. It’s typical of the Labor Party which is all into deals that they would be meeting  with Craig Thomson, possibly to talk about deals post the election. Mr Abbott has already  made it clear - we won’t be deal making with the cross-benches post the election to from  a  minority government.  What  Australia  needs  now  is  a  very clear  direction.  It’s  a  clear   choice, and that choice, we believe should be the Liberal/National Party.

QUESTION:

Could they not just be friends catching up for a beer?

CHRISTOPHER PYNE:

Well Mr Albanese is from the left and Mr Thomson is in the right. They share virtually  nothing in common expect the same Labor label. The idea that they would casually catch  up for a beer on a regular basis doesn’t really bear reality.

QUESTION:

Isn’t it a relatively cheap tactic to be launching a political point scoring exercise on the  basis of one grainy photo?

CHRISTOPHER PYNE:

Well  I  don’t  think  Mr  Albanese  wanted  to  be  in  The  Australian today  because  he  was   clearly having a private beer with the Member for Dobell whose been forced out of the  Labor  Party,  who  is  facing  172  charges  in  the  courts.  Who’s  lawyer  is  suing  the  NSW   Labor  Party General  Secretary for  $35  000  because  he  claims  he  was  promised  that  he   would  be  paid  that  in  February.  All  this  goes  to  the  usual  business  in  NSW  of  grubby   deals,  of  putting  Labor  first  and  the  people  second.  It’s  a  perfectly  reasonable  point  to   make. Mr Albanese, I think he would want to come out today and explain exactly what  was being talked about.



QUESTION:

The Liberal Party says that the NBN will cost (inaudible).

CHRISTOPHER PYNE:

Well the NBN is going to cost $96 billion, $96 billion to build it.

QUESTION:

If people want fast broadband they will have to pay that, under your policy to your door?

CHRISTOPHER PYNE:

Well if people want the Government’s broadband, they will be paying for that as well.

QUESTION:

They will also be paying for yours as well…

CHRISTOPHER PYNE:

Mr Turnbull cleared this  up this morning on the television. He made it absolutely clear  that Kevin Rudd was out there once again telling his usual bald face lies to get elected.  The  truth  is  that  Kevin  Rudd’s  campaign  is  unravelling.  He  looks  rattled,  he  sounds   rattled.  He  expected  to  be  carried  on  the  shoulders  of  the  Australian  people  when  he   returned  triumphantly  as  Prime  Minister.  He’s  discovered  that  he’s  just  the  same  old   Kevin Rudd. A leopard doesn’t change his sports. The people are working him out and he  is  looking  rattled  and  sounding  rattled.  So  he’s  lying  about  the  NBN  and  Malcolm   Turnbull cleared that up this morning.

QUESTION:

The Liberal Party, or the Coalition I should say, has put out a release this morning talking  about a Labor ad that has been removed from YouTube, pulled from YouTube, and has  been  heavily  critical  of  the  Labor  Party  for  this  negative  campaigning.  Isn’t  that  a  bit   hypocritical?  I mean  we  saw  the  Julie  Collins  ad  which  is  one  of  the  most  negative   political ads in recent memory. Isn’t that a bit hypocritical of the Coalition to try and take  the moral high ground on this?

CHRISTOPHER PYNE:

Well Kevin Rudd said that this would be a positive campaign. He said in his launch on  Sunday that he was sick of old politics; he was only into new politics. He wasn’t going to  have  any  negative  campaigning;  in  fact  he  said  he  instructed  the  Labor  Party  National   Secretary that there would be no negative ads. Just another Kevin Rudd spin fest. Within

48  hours  we’ve  seen  two  extraordinary  developments.  A  Labor  campaign  operative  in   South  Australia  tweeting  lies  about  the  Member  for  Boothby,  Andrew  Southcott.  The   Premier of South Australia having to humiliatingly ring and apologise to the member of  Boothby,  Andrew  Southcott  for  the  lies  being  put  around  by  campaign  operatives  in   South  Australia.  And  today,  YouTube  have  taken  down  a  offensive  ad  from  the  Labor   Party that was a negative attack on the Liberal Party. So YouTube itself have removed an  ad that  they regarded as  offensive. So Mr Rudd’s  so called gentler, kinder polity lasted  less  than 48 hours  because everything with Kevin Rudd is  fake. Nothing is  real. Kevin   Rudd  is  a  fake,  the  public  know  it - he  didn’t  really  mean  it  when  he  said  that  this   campaign would be positive. He talks about nothing other than Tony Abbott because he  hasn’t got any ideas of his own. He’s been proved, yet again to be fake Kevin.

QUESTION:

So in other words, you’re not angry that Labor is playing negative politics, you’re angry  that Labor has sunk to your level?

CHRISTOPHER PYNE:

Well, what’s important is that the public gets the facts about the Labor Party and about   Kevin Rudd. So explaining the facts to people is not negative advertising. So when Kevin  Rudd said he would stop the boats, he would turn the boats around in 2007 and then in  2008 he changed the laws so that now yesterday we passed 50,000 new boat arrivals in  the last 5 years. People have a right to know that. When Kevin Rudd said he would be an  economic  conservative  and  we  now  have  debt  approaching  400  billion,  unemployment   approaching  800,000  and  the  budget  blowing  out  by  3  billion  a  week  for  the  last  10   weeks, I think people have a right to know that. Pointing that out isn’t negative, it’s just  pointing out the facts about a very bad government.

QUESTION:

But the Julie Collins ad wants pointing out any facts - that was showing a junior minister  stumble  and  then  cutting  her  off  before  she  answered  the  question.  That’s  not  showing   any facts - that’s just negative campaigning.



CHRISTOPHER PYNE:

Well I actually disagree with you about that. The ad was demonstrating that Julie Collins  was the standard of Cabinet Minister that this government thinks is acceptable. And that  ad  indicated  that  she  couldn’t  really  answer  a  question  put  to  her  simply  at  a  press   conference in Canberra which we do every morning.

QUESTION:

Just  on  Gonski  - the  education  union  has  come  out  saying  that  the  Coalition  isn’t  matching Labor dollar for dollar and the singing up last week was a bit of a farce. What  are your thoughts on that?



CHRISTOPHER PYNE:

Well we are matching the Australian Labor Party’s budget forecast dollar for dollar. The  funding envelope over the next four years is the funding envelope that the Liberal Party is  promising. That means that you can vote Liberal or you can vote Labor and you will get  exactly  the  same  funding  result  in  school  education  so  we  can  move  the  debate  on  to   issues  like  teacher  quality,  autonomy  and  curriculum  and  parental  engagement.  And   importantly, we will dismantle all of the central command and control features of the new  school model and I think the NSW Teachers Federation greatest concern is that they want  the  central  command  features  from  Canberra.  We  don’t  - we  want  Tasmanians  to  run   Tasmanian schools and New South Welshmen to run New South Wales schools because  we don’t  won them  - we don’t  employ the teachers  and we will match Labor dollar to   dollar in terms of the funding over the forward estimates.

QUESTION:

But  they’re  saying  that  you’ve  only  signed  up  to  a  third  and  that  that  is  in  fact  only   chicken feed because the bulk of the money won’t be available until 2018/2019. Is that a  fact?

CHRISTOPHER PYNE:

That’s  more of a commentary on Labor trying to pretend that  they are putting rivers  of  gold into schools  when in fact  over the forward estimates  that’s  not  the case. Now you  can’t trust anything Labor says in five or six years from now. I mean you couldn’t trust  Kevin  Rudd  for  a  week  when  he  said  on  one  day  there  were  no  circumstances  under   which  he  could  return  as  Prime  Minister  and  less  than  a  week  later  he  was  challenging  and defeating Julia Gillard. So if you can’t trust the bloke for a week, you certainly can’t  trust him for five years.

QUESTION:

But the Coalition changed their Gonski position within a week. You’re saying one thing  one week and then you are matching Labor’s funding the next.

CHRISTOPHER PYNE:

Well we got to the point when we thought it was far too late in the school year to not give  schools  certainty for  next  year  and  I think  schools,  parents,  States  and  Territories  have   welcomed  the fact that on school funding we are on a unity ticket with the Labor Party.

QUESTION:



Were you bagging Gonski as late as Thursday night before you were sold on it?

CHRISTOPHER PYNE:

No. You don’t bag the Gonski (laughs) I’m not sure what that means exactly…

QUESTION:

The reforms themselves?

CHRISTOPHER PYNE:

I think it’s perfectly reasonable to point out when a government is trying to pretend one  thing and do the other. So Labor has tried to pretend that there are rivers of gold flowing  to schools under the new school funding model. The truth is that there was a $325 million  cut  which  because  of  all  the  various  side  deals,  there  is  now  probably  an  increase  in   spending over the new four years and the Coalition will support that. We will do it.

QUESTION:

So  it’s  not  true  that  you  weren’t  sold  as  late  as  Thursday  night  on  the  reforms   themselves?

CHRISTOPHER PYNE:

What  I  think  is  important  is  that  schools,  States,  Territories,  parents,  principals  have   certainty about their school funding for next year and the Coalition will give it to them.

QUESTION:

If I could square something up. Are you saying that YouTube have pulled that ad based  on its content?

CHRISTOPHER PYNE:

Yes.

QUESTION:

That’s pretty extraordinary stuff (inaudible)…

CHRISTOPHER PYNE:

Sure, that speaks volumes doesn’t it?

QUESTION:

(Inaudible).

CHRISTOPHER PYNE:

There are certain reasons why YouTube might pull an ad. Breach of copyright is one, the  grossly offensive nature of a particular ad, I assume this well could have been a breach of  copyright but I haven’t gone through the details of it, I just know that this is more Labor  dirty tricks in a campaign that the Prime Minister promised would be free of dirty tricks.

QUESTION:

So it could have been pulled for any reason?

CHRISTOPHER PYNE:

No, there are certain categories of reasons and I’ve outlined two of them.
