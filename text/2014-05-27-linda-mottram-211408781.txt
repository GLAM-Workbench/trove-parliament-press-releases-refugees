E&OE



LINDA MOTTRAM:    …..I started by asking Senator Brandis just a short time ago  whether because it is Australian policy and the Australian Government that sends asylum  seekers to detention on Manus Island, whether that means Australia has to take ultimate  responsibility for what happens there.

ATTORNEY-GENERAL:  No, Australia is not responsible for what happens on Manus  Island because that is a Papua New Guinean facility and the law enforcement issues in  relation to Manus Island are a matter for the Government of Papua New Guinea.  Now I  understand my colleague, Minister Scott Morrison, addressed this matter at length yesterday  and I really have nothing to add to what he said then.

LINDA MOTTRAM:  Just from your position as the First Law Officer, I suppose,  [inaudible] distinction between the responsibilities.  We send them there, it’s our policy.

ATTORNEY-GENERAL:  Well you see, Linda, I’m not the First Law Officer of Papua  New Guinea, I’m the First Law Officer of Australia and this is a Papua New Guinean issue.

LINDA MOTTRAM:  I’m wondering also, if I can just stay with that for one minute,  the report, the Minister yesterday, Scott Morrison, was saying if there’d been no protest there  wouldn’t have been an incident.  That’s blaming the victims is it not?

ATTORNEY-GENERAL:    I’m not going to be a commentator on what Mr Morrison  said.  I’m sure that everything Mr Morrison said was well said and I really don’t want to be a  commentator on the remarks of my colleague other than to support what he said

LINDA MOTTRAM:  Let me ask you about this issue which has been coming up in  the last few days.  You’ve had representations calling for the retention of the position of  Disability Discrimination Commissioner.  Graeme Innes’s term ends soon and the position

won’t be renewed.  Does Australia need a Disability Discrimination Commissioner do you  think?

ATTORNEY-GENERAL:  The people who are making these representations seem to be  singularly ill-informed because the position of Disability Discrimination Commissioner will  continue.  There was no announcement in the budget to abolish that position.  The position is  created by the Disability Discrimination Act and the position will continue.  Those who say  that the decision of the Government in the Budget to reduce the number of members of the  Human Rights Commission by one was equivalent to it abolishing the position of Disability  Discrimination Commissioner are just wrong.

LINDA MOTTRAM:   So there will be a person appointed to that position specifically  after Graeme Innes finishes up?

ATTORNEY-GENERAL:  There will be a Disability Discrimination Commissioner when  Mr Innes finishes. There has always been a Disability Discrimination Commissioner since the  post was established in 1993. For most of the time, as is the common practice of the Human  Rights Commission, that position will be held by one of the existing commissioners as indeed  Mr Innes, for most of his time as Disability Discrimination Commissioner, held two  portfolios.

LINDA MOTTRAM:           Graeme Innes is critical of the prospect that there might be  somebody who is not themselves with a disability holding that position.  Do you share that  concern?

ATTORNEY-GENERAL:    The Act doesn’t specify that the person must have a disability.  What is necessary is that the Commissioner who takes responsibility for the Disability  Commissioner’s role has a good understanding of that role and a good understanding of the  obligations cast upon them by the Act which creates it. I’m sure that that can be said for any  of the existing commissioners.  Who that will be is entirely a matter for the President of the  Commission, President Triggs, although I expect that she would consult the Government in  choosing the appropriate Commissioner.  But I’m at pains to make this point because it’s  been misunderstood - usually these portfolios, ,more than one of these portfolios is held by a  single Commissioner.  For example, Mr Innes, who began his term of service as Disability  Discrimination Commissioner in 2005 was both the Disability Discrimination Commissioner  and either the Race Discrimination Commissioner or the Human Rights Commissioner also  for all but three of the years in which he has served.  So the idea that one person would  occupy more than portfolio, just as I’m both the Attorney-General and Minister for the Arts,  is completely common place.

LINDA MOTTRAM:           Yes, I think Graeme Innes’s view though is that it has been  demonstrated that full-time commissioner in this role is as good thing especially if it is  somebody who has the lived experience of disability to use his term of phrase.  Is that outside  of what Act may specifically say, what past practice is?  Doesn’t this represent an  improvement in Australia’s handling of disability issues?



ATTORNEY-GENERAL:    Linda, I have a very high regard for the members of the  Australian Human Rights Commission.  I have a particularly high regard for the Presidents of  the Commission, Professor Triggs, and I am sure that she will choose wisely from among the  existing Commissioners in filling the role of Disability Discrimination Commissioner.

LINDA MOTTRAM:            The future of the other position on the Commission, are they  secure?  In other words will you seek to reduce the numbers of Commissioners by even more  than the one?

ATTORNEY-GENERAL:    The Government’s decision and the Budget measure  announced earlier in the month was to reduce the number of Commissioners by one.  The  Government will be looking to reform the Human Rights Commission and I’ve had a number  of conversations with the President of the Commission in relation to that and I will continue  to speak to her about it.  What we want is a Human Rights Commission that does proper  human rights work and the problem with the Australian Human Rights Commission, and I  don’t criticise Professor Triggs in this regard, is that it’s never really known what it was,  whether it was a human rights commission or whether it was an anti-discrimination  commission.  The emphasis, almost to the exclusion of all else in recent years, has been on its  anti-discrimination function.

But of course human rights is a much more expansive concept than merely anti-discrimination.  That’s why one of the first decisions the Government made in relation to the  Commission was to appoint to the vacancy the previous government had left, for the position  of Human Rights Commissioner, a person - namely Tim Wilson - whose background and  field of expertise was in liberal democratic and human rights, the classical freedoms that had  been, in my view, neglected by the Human Rights Commission in recent years.

LINDA MOTTRAM:           We’ve had some considerable discussion on this show about  that. I guess what I’m asking you today….

ATTORNEY-GENERAL:    I imagine it’s diminishing discussion because whereas there  were some who were initially unhappy that Mr Wilson had been appointed to that position in  December, the lived experience of Mr Wilson’s period in office over the last six-months is  that he has been an outstanding success and has the confidence of all the members of the  Commission.

LINDA MOTTRAM:           You are obviously looking at further reforms of some sort to  the Commission if I can read into what you are saying there.  What other reforms do you see?  Would you see numbers of Commissioners completely changing, the titles of the  Commissioners?

ATTORNEY-GENERAL:  All options are on the table but my approach to this is to  broaden the focus of the Commission.  It needs to have an anti-discrimination focus, no doubt  about that because the right to be free of unfair discrimination is an important human right.  But it needs a broader focus as well and my approach to the reform of the Commission will

be informed by that ambition of the Government to broaden the focus of the Human Rights  Commission so it deals with all human rights, not just some.

LINDA MOTTRAM:           Community groups have overwhelmingly opposed your initial  proposals to change sections 18C and 18D of the Race Discrimination Act.  You said last  week you didn’t hold a consultation process to turn around and ignore it.  What changes will  you make to your initial proposal?

ATTORNEY-GENERAL:    That is something that is under consideration at the  moment.  When the public consultation period finished earlier this month we had received  more than 5,000 submissions, I think it was about 5,300 submissions.  I want to take this  opportunity to thank everyone who took the trouble of making submissions, whether they  agreed with me or disagreed with me I want to thank them for taking the trouble to participate  in that important process. Now as you would expect I am now going through that large body  of submissions and that is a body of work that will some little time and on the basis of  consideration of those submissions, as well as consideration of the earlier consultations I had  face to face with a number of individuals, I will be taking something to Cabinet.

LINDA MOTTRAM:           Can I just press you a little bit harder on that, notwithstanding  that it needs to go to Cabinet.  Are you inclined to rein in the sweeping exclusions which  many feared would lead to open slather with racist and offensive remarks.

ATTORNEY-GENERAL:    I don’t think it’s very useful while I’m in the process of  considering what people say, but haven’t finished looking at the very large number of public  submissions to announce a conclusion.  As I said in the interview with The Australian  newspaper last week, the Government didn’t have a consultation period with the intention of  not listening to what people have to say - so of course we will take the views that have been  expressed.  This is a very, very important debate.  There is a large variety of views from all  points of the opinion spectrum and we will take into consideration all of those views and we  will arrive at a final proposal.

LINDA MOTTRAM:           Do you regret speaking of bigotry in the way that you did in the  Federal Parliament?

ATTORNEY-GENERAL:    I think the point one has to always remind people of in this  debate is that, as Tim Wilson said recently, your commitment to freedom of speech is only  tested when it goes beyond the bounds of social acceptability.

LINDA MOTTRAM:           Did you go beyond the bounds?

ATTORNEY-GENERAL:    No, because what I said was something that was undoubtedly  correct.  Let me give you an example of the sort of thing I have in mind.  Think a few years  ago of Pauline Hanson.  Pauline Hanson, in anybody’s language, was a shocking  bigot.  Some of the things she said were really, in my view, dreadful things to say.  Does  anyone seriously suggest that there should have been a law to prevent her from saying what  she said?



LINDA MOTTRAM:           And under existing law nobody took any action against her did  they?

ATTORNEY-GENERAL:    Indeed they didn’t. I mean this is a person who led a  movement that 15 years ago attracted at one stage in the State of Queensland the support of  23% of the electorate.  Does anyone seriously suggest that the way to deal with the sort of  social attitudes that Pauline Hanson expressed was to engage in political censorship?

LINDA MOTTRAM:           But nobody did under the existing formulations.

ATTORNEY-GENERAL:    That’s the very point I’m making.  The best way to deal with  bigoted speech is to get it out in the open so people can see it for what it is.  We had an  example of this in the United States only a couple of weeks ago with the Mr Sterling, the  owner of the Los Angeles sporting team, who said some really, really offensive things.  And  President Obama’s response, if I may quote him, “with people like that let them talk, let them  talk.” It’s much better to get offensive language out into the open and let it be exposed for  what it is than to political censor it and drive it underground.

LINDA MOTTRAM:           By and large that is what has happened under the existing  formulation.

ATTORNEY-GENERAL:    By and large it’s what has happened but under the existing  section 18C, the method that is adopted is a method that allows for the censorship of opinion  and I don’t think, the Government doesn’t think that that is the right way to tackle bigotry or  racism.

LINDA MOTTRAM:           Are you looking to make room for academic argument as  opposed to, I guess, uneducated deeply racist slanderous comments?  Are you drawing some  distinctions there?

ATTORNEY-GENERAL:    I don’t think that in view of what I’ve already said about the  consideration that I’m currently giving to the very large number of submissions that have  come in from the public that it’s appropriate for me, as I’ve said before, state a conclusion  about where this process might end up.  But, you know, Linda, you reveal a particular attitude  in the way you put that question when you say what about ill-educated people.  Can I tell you,  ill-educated people or poorly educated people have every much right to their opinions as  everybody else.

LINDA MOTTRAM:           It’s the start of Reconciliation Week today.  The Australian  Football League, Aussie Rules, from my home state of Western Australia, big supporter, adds  its official support today for Constitutional recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait  Islanders.  What are you doing to hasten the circumstances, I suppose, that would allow a  successful referendum?



ATTORNEY-GENERAL:    The referendum to give appropriate Constitutional recognition  of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island peoples is one of the key priorities of Tony Abbott’s  Government.  We are informed by the views of the expert panel that was convened under the  previous government, under the co-chairmanship of Professor Pat Dobson and Mark  Liebler.  One of the things that they said is that we should hasten slowly to this, that we  should develop a proposal that is likely to be supported and that the proposal should not be  put until public opinion had been prepared and that it was likely to succeed because, Linda,  imagine how terrible it would be if we put up a proposal and were to fail.  What we want to  do is to recapture the spirit of the 1967 Referendum.

LINDA MOTTRAM:           Are we close to that?

ATTORNEY-GENERAL:    Can I just make this point - the 1967 Referendum was the  most successful referendum in Australian history.  It got something like 90 per cent of the  vote. It had bipartisan support though it was promoted by the Liberal Government of Harold  Holt.  What we want in a bipartisan fashion is to develop a proposal and bring public opinion  with us. I actually think the public opinion that the Australian people want to see the first  Australians recognised in the Constitution.  Obviously the moment we settle upon a form of  words then people are going to look carefully at that form of words to ensure that we’re not  embarking on radical Constitutional change. That’s not what we want to do.  This is a  conservative proposal to right an historic wrong.

LINDA MOTTRAM:           Do you think we’re close?

ATTORNEY-GENERAL:    We’re closer and Senator Scullion, the Minister for Indigenous  Affairs, and I have been given joint ministerial responsibility to steer this process.  There is a  Parliamentary committee under the chairmanship of Ken Wyatt, the Liberal Member for  Hasluck, who’s the first Indigenous Member of the House of Representatives, which is  examining and conducting public hearings to develop a form of words at the moment and that  process will take until towards the end of this year.

LINDA MOTTRAM:           Minister, thank you very much for spending time with us this  morning.

ATTORNEY-GENERAL:    A pleasure.
