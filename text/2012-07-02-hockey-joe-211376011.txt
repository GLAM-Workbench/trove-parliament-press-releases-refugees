JOE HOCKEY:

Here is a living, breathing example of the confusion that surrounds the carbon tax. Bob’s  advised me that they still haven’t been informed by their electricity supplier how much  electricity bills are going to increase. But they know they are going to increase and they  know they are going to have to meet that cost. They haven’t been advised by their  refrigerant supplier how much the gases will go up. This is a business that has an electricity  bill of between $750,000 and $900,000 a year and overwhelmingly the challenge for a  business like this, a community business, is how to meet the increased costs head-on.  They haven’t been able to increase their costs yet, or pass it on yet, because they still  haven’t been informed by their suppliers how much more they are going to have to pay.  This proves that it is going to be a python squeeze.

People are going to have a tax that continues to grow, a tax that continues to grow as each  year passes, and yet the compensation is not going to make any difference. Here is a club  that doesn’t get a dollar of compensation from Julia Gillard, yet they have to meet the costs.  Julia Gillard has been saying and claiming that this is not a tax people have to pay. Well,  here is a living, breathing example of people that will have to pay the carbon tax. So as I  say as I travel around the country with my colleagues over the next few weeks and every  week until the next election, the carbon tax is a bad idea. It is a disastrous tax that is going  to have a profound impact on the Australian economy.  It is a tax that is buried, but it is  everyone’s bill that is going to increase with it. And Julia Gillard, Wayne Swan and others  can run around the country saying the sun came up yesterday, the bottom line is that this  tax is going to have a profound impact on businesses and on the community for a very long  period of time.

I’ll ask Bob to say a few words about the impact on Parramatta Leagues Club.

BOB BENTLEY:

Thank you, Joe. I think all clubs in Australia are going to feel the effects of the carbon tax.  It’s the great uncertainty; the great unknown what the cost will be to our business. Look, I  don’t like to say it, but it may mean jobs for some of our employees because we are going  to have to pass those costs and increases onto our members and guests. Clubs are a  community asset; they are an entertainment amenity and the carbon tax with have a  significant on all clubs in Australia.

JOE HOCKEY:

Any questions?

JOURNALIST:

Major companies have come out in support of the carbon tax like some major banks. They  don’t think it is that bad?

JOE HOCKEY:

Well, when banks come in support of something like this you can be sure they are going to  make money out of it. Other businesses that have come out in support are the beneficiaries  of huge payments from the Government, so they are not going to complain about the  carbon tax. The bottom line is everyday Australians are going to have to pay increased  costs. In some cases they are known, in many cases they are not known. Here we have a  club that has increased costs but they don’t know what they are because their suppliers  haven’t informed them yet. But what you do know is the bills are going to rise and as each  bill rises, until the carbon tax is abolished, the carbon tax will have an impact. Therefore  what we are offering is from day one we’ll move to get rid of this bad tax. It is a bad tax with  insidious purpose and it is going to have a profound impact on the Australian economy.

JOURNALIST:

The Government says it will have minimal impact on people’s bottom line. Your view is  quite the opposite. How did they get it so wrong, or vice versa?

JOE HOCKEY:

The Treasury modelling assumes that the Government keeps relying on, assumes that the  rest of the world is going to move in the same direction. The rest of the world is not.  Therefore there is major competitive disadvantage foe Australia. And let me be very clear, I  heard about an interview between David Koch and Julia Gillard this morning where they  were talking about the impact on trade exposed industries. There is not a dollar to help  people that supply services to the Australian tourism industry, yet that is one of our major  exports. And for a lot of educational institutions that are also significant export contributors,  they are not getting any compensation. So let us be very clear, small business and  businesses involved in the tourism industry, the education industry, health and a range of  other areas are going to have to pay the carbon tax and they are going to be at a  competitive disadvantage to others they compete with overseas.

JOURNALIST:

So to voters, the Government is saying ‘don’t worry, you won’t feel it’. What would you say  to those people?

JOE HOCKEY:

Well if you can’t trust Julia Gillard when she said she wouldn’t introduce a carbon tax you  can’t trust her when she says ‘don’t worry, you won’t feel the pain’.

JOURNALIST:

If Tony Abbott is elected how long will it take for Tony Abbott to repeal the carbon tax?

JOE HOCKEY:

After the swearing-in the first item of business for the parliamentary program will be to  introduce legislation to abolish the carbon tax. And we will want to get that through the  Parliament as quickly as possible.

JOURNALIST:

How quickly can that be? Is it at least six months? Longer than six months?

JOE HOCKEY:

Well, we have to see what the Labor Party is going to do. Hopefully the Labor Party will be  mugged by the reality of being thrown out at the next election and will allow legislation to  repeal this insidious tax to pass through the Parliament unhindered. If they obstruct then  they may well face a double dissolution election.

JOURNALIST:

The Constitution says it can’t happen before six months, is that right?

JOE HOCKEY:

No, the Constitution doesn’t say that.

JOURNALIST:

Can it happen before six months?

JOE HOCKEY:

What, to abolish the tax?

JOURNALIST:

Yes.

JOE HOCKEY:

You can pass legislation as quickly as possible and it can go through the parliament in a  day. It’s just a question of whether the Labor Party in the Senate wants to play ball. The  Labor Party is going to be mugged by the reality of the anger of the Australian people at the  next election. Australians cannot give up on their anger about this tax because the Labor  Party needs to know the biggest mistake they’ve made is to lie to the Australian people.  Labor is rotten to the core and the best evidence of that is this carbon tax which is based on  a lie, not just a lie from Julia Gillard but Wayne Swan as well, lets not let him off the hook.  Wayne Swan was saying that it was a hysterical allegation that the Labor Party would  introduce a carbon tax, and they have. So Wayne Swan is Tweedledum and Julia Gillard is  Tweedledee.

JOURNALIST:

What do you expect to happen to interest rates tomorrow?

JOE HOCKEY:

Look. I’m not going to speculate on interest rates tomorrow. But I will just to say to you,  obviously there is an inflationary impact of the carbon tax.  The Reserve Bank will choose  to see through that inflationary impact for the moment. But because this is a python  squeeze, because, for example, here at the Parramatta Leagues Club you will see the  costs of the carbon tax flowing through over time, then it is hard to identify the immediate  one-off impact on inflation. But you can be sure that as prices increase there is going to be  an increase in inflation as a result of the carbon tax.

JOURNALIST:

So you think the Reserve Bank should give households some reprieve because of the  carbon tax?

JOE HOCKEY:

I’ll leave that to the Reserve Bank. I don’t want to speculate on interest rates.

JOURNALIST:

Do you think the Labor Party will have some tricks up their sleeves? More compensation as  the pinch starts to be felt?

JOE HOCKEY:

Well the whole idea of the carbon tax is to cause pain, to change behaviour, that’s the  whole idea. And what they are doing is they are going and putting bandaids over particular  industries like more than $60 million they have spent down at Whyalla. That’s a bandaid  over a very significant wound. It won’t solve the problem. But there’s no bandaid for  Parramatta Leagues Club, there’s no compensation for small businesses out there and at  the end of the day whatever they are paying in compensation to families and pensions just  won’t be enough to compensate for rising costs of living as a result of the carbon tax.

JOURNALIST:

Just on asylum seekers. Given your tears during the debate …

JOE HOCKEY:

There were no tears…

JOURNALIST:

Well, are you happy with the way with supporting a policy that could see children locked up  indefinitely?

JOE HOCKEY:

Sorry, what policy?

JOURNALIST:

Asylum seeker.

JOE HOCKEY:

Whose policy proposes locking up children indefinitely?

JOURNALIST:

The policy that the Government put forward.

JOE HOCKEY:

Let me just say this. We had a three pronged approach. We had a Pacific solution, we had  temporary protection visas and where possible you turn the boats around and send them  back to where they came from. I cannot believe a Prime Minister who would contract out  the responsibly of a Prime Minister to a committee after what happened last week in  Parliament. I’m afraid we have a Prime Minister without any core principles and frankly, it’s  not just the carbon tax or the mining tax or asylum seekers or all the other mistakes she’s  made, it’s the fact that we have a Prime Minister without any core principles and she has  taken the Labor Party to hell in a hand basket, and for nothing. The Labor Party needs to

understand they can talk up the carbon tax as much as they want, they can talk up  Malaysia as much as they want. We will unwind the evils of this Government. We will do  that because these decisions of this Government are not in the best interest of the  Australian people.

JOURNALIST:

If the carbon tax is repealed, how long will it take for electricity prices to decrease by ten  percent?

JOE HOCKEY:

We expect the electricity producers would drop their prices as quickly as possible with the  abolition of the carbon tax. We are also very mindful that there has been compensation  paid to businesses. There are a lot of businesses that are getting nothing to compensate for  the carbon tax. It won’t be hard to abolish this tax. When it comes to the other side of the  equation we will have to look at individual contracts but what I can say to you is that there  will be a fairer deal for consumers, for families because there is not going to be the upward  pressure of a carbon tax on prices in the electricity industry.

Thank you.
