TRANSCRIPT OF THE LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION  THE HON JOHN HOWARD MP  PRESS CONFERENCE - LIBERAL PARTY, SYDNEY

Topics: 1996 Federal Election

E& OE............................................

Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. I am delighted that the Prime Minister has  announced the election date. I look forward to a strong campaign. I look forward to  providing the Australian people with a clear choice. I look forward to providing the  Australian people with an opportunity o f bringing to an end 13 very long years o f  Labor Government. Thirteen years in government is a long time in anybody's language

and all o f the signs o f atrophy and decay are apparent in that government. The  arrogance, the lack o f contact with reality, the failure to appreciate the fundamental  problems o f Australian society and the Australian economy - all o f those characteristics  are those o f a government that has been in power for far too long. And on so many

counts Australia needs a change o f government.

In the weeks ahead I will do two things. I will identify the many failures o f the  Government after 13 years and that is a legitimate role o f an opposition in an election  campaign, and I will also outline the alternative values, the alternative philosophies and

the alternative solutions o f the Coalition. After 13 years the Prime Minister doesn't  have a lot to present to the Australian people. When he assumed office as Treasurer  we owed the rest o f the world $23,000 million. We now owe the rest o f the world  $180,000 million or more. Over the last 13 years the gap between rich and poor in

Australia has widened. With a youth unemployment rate o f between 25 and 30 per  cent the Prime Minister can hardly claim to have delivered his obligations to young  Australia.

We have one o f the highest inflation rates in the western world. We have some o f the  highes*. real interest rates in the rest o f the world and in 1995 our current account  deficit was the worst in the industrialised world. So on that score, on the score o f  accountability for years in office, the Government can hardly present itself as being a  group o f people that can take Australia forward with confidence to the 21st century.  B ut it has not only been a government o f economic failure. It has been a government

that has failed the Australian people in the area o f values and standards. One o f the

most disturbing things o f public life now is so ready are the Australian people to  disbelieve what they have been told by their political leaders.

The current Prime Minister has elevated to an art form the dishonouring o f election  promises, the most notorious o f which o f course was his infamous L-A-W law tax cut  commitment before the 1993 election. So one o f the great issues in this campaign will  o f course be the credibility o f the two sides o f politics. And let me say again in very  clear terms, at the commencement o f this campaign, that I will not be embarking upon  a wild spending spree to entice the support o f the Australian people. I've said before,

and I say it again, that I would rather promise half o f what I'm asked to commit myself  to during the campaign, and deliver all o f that, than to promise everything that I am  asked to do but deliver only half and to break my trust with the Australian people.

I look forward to the day when once again the Australian people can believe  commitments made to them by their political leaders. I look forward to the day when  there has been a rebuilding o f that confidence and trust between people and  government. I also intend to bring in government a group o f men and women who will  govern for all o f us and not just for a few o f us. One o f the features o f government,  particularly under the current Prime Minister, has been the extent to which political  debts have been repaid in the form o f government decisions, o f how decisions have  been made on the basis o f which group is able to exert the maximum pressure. That is  not government for all o f us, it is government for a few o f us. I refuse to accept that  there are not solutions to the great problems facing Australia as we move towards the

end o f this century. I refuse to accept that there is not an answer to the high level o f  youth unemployment.

I believe that the process o f economic reform can be recommenced. I believe that  there is an answer to a very large and seemingly out o f control current account deficit.  And the answer to those problems lies in the applications o f the many policies that we  have already unveiled and those that we will unveil during the course o f the campaign.

In particular I will be stressing the vital role that small business can play in reducing  unemployment. I have long held the belief that a revitalised, reactivated small business  community can do more than anything else to reduce unemployment in Australia, and I  will be unveiling a number o f initiatives calculated to reduce the regulatory and other  burdens on the small business community.

I will also during the course o f the campaign be placing a very heavy focus indeed on  policies designed to help keep families together. The strength and the coherence and  the stability provided by families, not only in an emotional sense but also in a material  sense, has always been at the heart o f Australian life, and it will be my intention to lead

a Government that will design and implement policies to help and assist the unity o f all  Austra'ian families.

Can I say just one final thing to you ladies and gentlemen. I don't seek the greatest  office in Australia on some kind o f rotation principle. I don't believe that I should be  Prime Minister o f Australia because it is my turn. I believe that I should be Prime  Minister o f Australia because I believe I can do a much better job than the current

incumbent.

*

I believe that I can restore trust and believability in the office. I believe that I can  reforge links between the Government and the people of Australia that have grown  weakened over the last 13 years. I believe passionately in the unity o f the Australian  people. I believe passionately in the things that unite us as Australians rather than the  things that divide us.

And it is my intention to lead a government for all o f us and not just for a few o f us.

JO U R N A LIST:

Prime M inister,....

H O W A R D :

Thank you. That's what I call a very commendable start!

(laughter)

JO U R N A LIST:

The Prime Minister has said that he'd like to have team debates with his team and your  team. Would you be interested?

H O W A R D :

Look, I will be very happy to debate the Prime Minister. I've indicated that already,  and I'm sure that all o f my colleagues will be very happy to debate their counterparts.  I've seen Peter Reith debate Laurie Brereton several times already. I look forward to  other Ministers that the Prime Minister didn't mention this morning, like Robert  Tickner, Carmen Lawrence, Rosemary Crowley, Jeanette McHugh, John Faulkner. I  look forward to all o f those people participating. Let me make it very clear to you that  the Opposition will be more than happy to engage in the maximum amount o f debate  and exchange and cut and thrust during this campaign. If Gary Gray who's meeting  Andrew Robb tomorrow morning has particular proposals he wants to put, well we'll  naturally have a look at them, but just remember that the only time in the last 15 years  that anybody, that any political leader in Australia has squibbed a debate during the

campaign, was in 1987 when Bob Hawke refused to debate me.

JO U R N A LIST:

M r Howard, you say you'll need seven or more seats to win power. Are you confident  you can win these and what seats are you after?

H O W A R D :

Well, a lot more than seven. I am confident but I'm not smug. It's going to be a tough  campaign. Incumbent governments always have advantages that are denied to  oppositions. Incumbency is a potent factor in any political contest and I want to say to  all o f my colleagues, we are in very good shape, we have displayed unity and cohesion

3

f

unmatched over the last 13 years. The electorate wants change. Many millions of  Australians are literally aching for a change o f Government but it is going to be a tough  fight. I obviously have identified a large number o f marginals. A lot o f them are in  N ew  South Wales, a lot in Queensland, but there are marginal seats in Victoria as well.  I have a 33 day program that will take me twice to every State o f Australia. We have a  range o f policies that are I believe winning policies throughout the nation and not just  in the marginal seats.

JOURNALIST:

M r Howard, M r Keating has said you are bereft o f policies. When are we going to see  some concrete facts coming out o f the Opposition?

HOWARD:

Well M r Keating would be expected to say that. I have already outlined loads o f  policies and I've said before and I say it again, the time for the initiatives is now, and  you will see over the next 33 days the unveiling o f a large number o f initiatives. Quite  a number o f them will come as a complete surprise to my political opponent, just as he

might expect as expect things o f him. But I can say to you and I can say through you  to the Australian people that on the second o f March they will be in no doubt as to the  clear choice that we offer. We'll not only be reminding the Australian people o f the

negatives o f the Government, but we will be reminding the Australian people that we  offer a positive, clear and sharp alternative. An alternative rooted in the mainstream  values o f Australian community, an alternative rooted in the beliefs o f a group o f men  and women who will be in Government practical reformers.

JOURNALIST:

M r Howard, does the length o f the campaign from now on effect your tactics?

HOWARD:

No.

JOURNALIST:

... announcing your policies then?

HOWARD:

We are perfectly placed to start the campaign, and the whole thing is entirely ...I  expected on balance that there would be an announcement this weekend, but if it had  have been last weekend we would have been ready. The Liberal and National Party  organisations are well prepared for the campaign. Just before I arrived here I  discussed with Mr Nutt, the State Director in New South Wales the state o f  preparedness o f the New South Wales Division and I am well satisfied with that. I

couldn't be more pleased at this stage about the state o f organisation or readiness, and  that's very important in modem election campaigns, and I find nothing, strategically or

4

tactically difficult about the election date that has been announced by my Labor  opponent.

JOURNALIST:

M r Howard, you've said that Keating is looking old and tired, but you've been in  Opposition all the time that the Government's been going. What makes you think that  the electorate won't think you are old and tired in Opposition?

HOWARD:

Well it's what you do rather than the number o f years you've clocked up on this earth  that determines whether the public think you are an old tired government. I mean, the  McMahon Government that was defeated in 1972 was in fact much younger in age  than the government that replaced it, but that didn't mean that the public at that  particular time took the view that there shouldn't be a change. It's an attitude in mind,  it's a mindset in the present Government that people are reacting against. It's the  arrogance, the detachment from reality. I mean, 13 years is a very long time, and when  you've been in power for 13 years, you take people for granted. The Prime Minister's  remark about the Indonesian Treaty, "the reason I didn't make it public", he said, "is  that if I'd made it public people mightn't have supported it". I mean, that is an  astonishingly arrogant remark. We are supposed to live in a democracy where the  views and the values o f people are important.

JOURNALIST:

M r Howard many sections o f the ethnic community are suspicious o f you and the  Coalition in terms (inaudible) policy to protect (inaudible)?

HOWARD:

I don’t think it will affect the vote it all. I f  you’d have been in my company yesterday  at two naturalisation ceremonies you wouldn’t have found any evidence o f that kind,  any evidence at all (interjection). You wouldn’t have found any evidence at all o f that.

I am confident that the Coalition will receive its due share o f the votes o f what you  choose to call the ethnic vote or ethnic Australia. I have very good links with ethnic  communities all over the country and I would remind you that the great milestones in

the development o f the diverse, tolerant, modem Australian were in fact things that  occurred during the lifetime o f Coalition governments. The great waves o f migration  in the 1950s and early 1960s, the end o f the White Australia policy under the  government o f Harold Holt and the great Indo-Chinese refugee programme o f the late

1970s authored by the Fraser government, o f which I was a member, and which  programme incidentally received no help, and indeed on occasions absolute hostility  from leading Labor Party figures at the time including Mr Hawke.

JOURNALIST:

M r Howard (inaudible) the so called Kennett factor will lose you critical marginal seats  in Victoria?

5

HOWARD:

N ot at all. N ot at all.

JOURNALIST:

Can you nominate a most crucial state for your election Mr Howard?

HOWARD:

Oh, I ’ve been in this game long enough to know they’re all crucial and I ’ll be going flat  out visiting seats all over Australia.

JOURNALIST:

Do you concede that State Liberal governments, particularly in Victoria and Western  Australia, do make it harder for you in those States?

HOWARD:

No, I don’t believe so Jenny. This is an election campaign that will, I believe, produce  more than the usual focus on national as distinct from regional issues. There’s an  element about this election that I believe puts it as something amounting to an end o f  an era election. A lot o f Australians will see it as the appropriate time to bring the  Hawke/Keating years to an end. Whatever views some people may charitably have  taken about their early years you can’t find many people in Australia who any longer  believe that this government has any stomach for economic reform and any longer  believes that it has, for example, stomach for Industrial Relations reform o f any kind.

The Prime Minister declared a few days ago that there was no need for any changes in  industrial relations at all. Well, to the make that declaration he not only contradicts me  but he contradicts the speech he delivered to the Confederation o f Industry  immediately after the 1993 election when he outlined a detailed program o f reform. I  mean this man has run out o f steam on the score o f practical economic reform and  people looking for measured reassuring reform won’t get it from this government.

JOURNALIST:

What will a Howard era be like?

HOWARD:

Well, a Howard era will bring a more united Australia. I want to see an Australian  nation by the turn o f the century that is relaxed about its past, relaxed about its present  and relaxed about its future. I want to see an Australian nation where people identify  on things that bind them together rather than things that push them apart. I want to

see an Australian nation that doesn’t indulge in a paralysis o f analysis about its identity,

6

but an Australian nation that feels confident and assertive in the world, yet respectful  and tolerant towards the differences o f others.

JOURNALIST:

M r Howard in your speech earlier you said that there is undue pressure o f some groups  on policies on a Keating Government. Will you nominate what groups have had too  much influence?

HOWARD:

Well the one that wins by a country mile o f course is the leadership o f the trade union  movement. Under a Howard Government there will not be seats at the Cabinet table  with the leaders o f the trade union movement, but by the same token I will talk to the  union movement. I will treat the union movement as a legitimate representative o f the  people who are members o f the trade unions in Australia. Trade unions are a  legitimate and proper part o f the fabric o f Australian society. My argument is not with  mainstream trade unionism, my argument is with the trade union movement having a  monopoly on the bargaining process in Australia and certainly the decisions the  Government did in relation to CRA where the Prime Minister made himself a stage

extra while the dispute was going on and the ANL dispute, both o f them demonstrated  a marked willingness on the part o f the Government to be brow beaten, sidelined and  consigned to irrelevance where the interest to the trade union movement were  concerned.

Thank you very much.

ends.
