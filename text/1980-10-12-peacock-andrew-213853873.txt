THE HON. ANDREW PEACOCK M.P.

$13m Food Aid for East African Famine

The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Andrew Peacock,

today announced measures being taken in response to chronic

food shortages in a number of East African countries,

particularly in the Horn of Africa.

Mr Peacock said that severe drought in many regions,

aggravated by civil disruption, warfare and the movement

of large numbers of refugees to normally food-deficit countries,

had all acted to produce the food crisis. In the light of

this crisis, greater emphasis would be given to directing

food aid to Africa under Australia's 1980/81 food aid

program. Five countries of the East African region -

Sudan, Ethiopia, Somalia, Uganda and Kenya would

receive close to 70,000 tonnes of foodgrain from Australia

this financial year. This grain, including some freight

costs, would be worth in excess of $13 million,  more than

double normal Australian food aid to the region.

Mr Peacock explained that the distribution

of food aid to the most needy regions would be inhibited

by the very reasons for the crisis in the first place -

poor roads and infrastructure,  bad communications, limited

fuel and transport capacity, and the absence of an orderly

distribution system.

Mr Peacock said that, to help overcome these

distribution problems, Australia would be associating its

assistance with the efforts of the UNHCR, the World Food

Program and related United Nations bodies active in the

region.
