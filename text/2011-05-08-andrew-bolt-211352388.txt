TRANSCRIPT OF THE HON. TONY ABBOTT MHR  INTERVIEW WITH ANDREW BOLT,  THE BOLT REPORT, CHANNEL TEN

Subjects: Border protection; Julia Gillard’s carbon tax.

E&OE……………………….…………………………………………………………………

ANDREW BOLT:

Opposition Leader Tony Abbott now joins us. Tony, what do you think - sending 800 of our boat people to  Malaysia, taking 4,000 of theirs back. Is this so crazy it might work?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, it’s a lousy deal for Australia, Andrew. I mean, it’s probably a terrific deal for Malaysia but it’s a  hopeless deal for Australia. This idea that we will send them one and get five back, we’ll pay for them to  take our one and we’ll pay for the costs of the five that are coming, it really… my wife said to me ‘is this an  April Fools’ Day joke’ when I told her…

ANDREW BOLT:

But it might work. It might just work. If you are a boat person in Indonesia you might think twice about  coming if you are going to end up back in Malaysia.

TONY ABBOTT:

What works is Nauru, Manus, temporary protection visas and the willingness to turn boats around where it’s  safe to do so and…

ANDREW BOLT:

But it’s got the Nauru bit though hasn’t it, in the sense of it’s sending 800 of our boat people to Malaysia, or  not Nauru to Malaysia. That bit you’d support, wouldn’t you?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, what I support is policies that work and we know what works because it did work in the past. We did  have a problem; John Howard created a solution. Julia Gillard and Kevin Rudd took a solution and turned it  into a problem again and…

ANDREW BOLT:

But it hardly matters whether it’s sending to Nauru or sending it to Malaysia, sending the boat people to  Nauru or Malaysia does it?

TONY ABBOTT:

Sending people to Malaysia means that we get five back for every one we send. Nauru doesn’t have any to  send back. That’s the point. I mean, if we send them to Nauru they go there, we don’t get any automatically  back. If we send 800 to Malaysia we get 4,000 back and Malaysia becomes the back door route to Australia,  the open back door to Australia, and that’s why this really is a lousy deal for our country.

ANDREW BOLT:

Turning to politics that you’ve been putting out there, you gave a major speech this week about the carbon  dioxide tax, the questions that the Government must answer in the budget about the level and all that kind of  thing. One question you didn’t answer was how much will the Government’s tax and spending cut the  world’s temperature by? Why didn’t you ask that question?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, Andrew, the point about our direct action policy is that we’ll plant more trees, we’ll improve our soils,  we’ll use smarter technology that turns carbon dioxide from a waste product into a valuable input, and these  are objectively good things to do regardless of the impact on carbon dioxide.

ANDREW BOLT:

How much will your programmes actually cut the world’s temperature by do you think?

TONY ABBOTT:

I’ll leave the scientists to argue that point. What I want to do, Andrew, is to meet our commitment to reduce  carbon dioxide emissions by five per cent by 2020 and I think that we can do that and at the same time we  can actually improve the environment with more trees, better soils and smarter technology.

ANDREW BOLT:

Would you quarrel with the maths that I’ve had done by the experts and that neither you nor the  Government’s programmes will cut the temperature by anything more at best than 0.0005 of a degree?

TONY ABBOTT:

Andrew, look, I’ll leave the mathematicians and the scientists to quibble. I certainly think it’s interesting that  the Government’s climate change ambassador said that the Government’s policies aren’t going to make a  difference for hundreds of years; in a thousand years time we might notice a difference. And that’s why it’s  so important not to try to damage jobs, drive up the cost of living, attack our economy in ways that other  countries aren’t attacking theirs in this cause.

ANDREW BOLT:

Can I ask you one last question before you go, a quick one. You spent a lot of effort trying to get the  independents to back you; they backed Julia Gillard. If they came to you today and said ‘we’ve made a  mistake, we’d like to make you prime minister’ what would your answer be, ‘look, I’ll take it’ or ‘no, I’ll  settle for an election instead’?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, they haven’t come to me, Andrew. They haven’t come to me and look I’ll cross that bridge if I ever  come to it. I think what we’ve got at the moment, Andrew, is a public which is increasingly concluding that  minority government is an experiment that’s failed. I think the public are increasingly concluding that this  Government is utterly incompetent and untrustworthy and that the Prime Minister is not up to it. I think that  if this budget is the dud that I think it will be a lot of people will have concluded that the Government’s an  embarrassment that should be got rid of as quickly as possible. But look, in the end what the independents  do is entirely up to them.

ANDREW BOLT:

Thank you very much for joining us today.

TONY ABBOTT:

And Andrew look, congratulations on the programme.

ANDREW BOLT:

That’s good of you.

TONY ABBOTT:

May if flourish.

ANDREW BOLT:

Thank you. Yes, may it flourish indeed.
