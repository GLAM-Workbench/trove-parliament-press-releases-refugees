E&EO…………………………………………………………………………………………..

DAVID SPEERS:

The man who's driven a lot of the changes announced this week is the Immigration  Minister Peter Dutton. He's worked with the Prime Minister on these changes for  months and I spoke to Peter Dutton earlier. Minister, thanks very much for your time.

PETER DUTTON:

Thanks David.

DAVID SPEERS:

Has it been too easy to become an Australian citizen until now and do we have  Australian citizens who really shouldn't be Australian citizens?

PETER DUTTON:

Well the short answer is yes. The vast majority of people do the right thing, but we  know for example that we have taken citizenship away from some people; we know  that people have provided fraudulent information when they've applied for their  citizenship, and in the modern age I think it is appropriate and timely that we update  the way in which we apply the citizenship laws and by asking people to abide by our  laws and adopt Australian values, I think it's a restatement of what has been a long-standing principle. But we move it now from an administrative process into one  where we will have more checks and balances and I think then we can be assured  that we are getting the most out of people that want to become Australian citizens.

DAVID SPEERS:

So the Australian values seems to be the key here. At the moment the pledge of  commitment that new citizens have to take says; ‘I pledge my loyalty to Australia and

2

its people whose democratic beliefs I share, whose rights and liberties I respect and  whose laws I will uphold and obey.’ Why doesn't that go far enough?

PETER DUTTON:

Well at the moment that's a statement and we're going out to consultation to see how  that might be expanded - I think it should include allegiance for example - but we're  open to discussion about making sure that that is a more meaningful statement of  commitment and allegiance - I think that's important - but that is principled if you  like. The more substantive aspect to what we're proposing here, firstly, is in relation  to the English language requirement and the reality is if you want people to take  advantage of a nation like ours, we want people to be able to engage in work if  they're of a working age with a capacity to work, we want their kids to be able to  immerse themselves in local communities and English language is an important  requirement.

DAVID SPEERS:

You're going to raise the bar from basic to competent level of English language.

PETER DUTTON:

Yes.

DAVID SPEERS:

I mean, you met just yesterday with some of the Yazidi refugees that we've  welcomed to Australia in Wagga Wagga. How likely are they to be able to have  competent level English in, what four years, before they want to become a citizen?

PETER DUTTON:

Well I think very likely. I think there is a very different situation that might have been  faced by people coming out of war-torn Europe in the '50s or '60s and there is  certainly a lot of assistance, a lot of support both online, within the community,  provided and funded by the Government as well. So there is a lot of support to take  up English language lessons. And again I think allowing people four years to improve  their standard is important. It's important to note also that there is an exemption  under that requirement for people over the age of 60 or under the age of 16. So we  do target people in particular of working age…

DAVID SPEERS:

…right; so sorry, just to be clear on that, anyone over 60 or under 16 won't have to  be competent in English?

PETER DUTTON:

That's right. So we will encourage that, but it's not a requirement for citizenship. So I  think that's important that young children are learning and improving their English,

3

either through school or study otherwise if they're in the workplace and for  grandparents who are coming to Australia on a Remaining Parent visa or a Relative  visa, whatever the case might be, then I think that's a sensible application of the  measure. But by and large the English language is important for people (a) to be  engaged in work or study, or to be a functioning member of society.

DAVID SPEERS:

Coming back to the values though, so this will be part of the test. What sort of  Australian values would you like to test for?

PETER DUTTON:

Well I think the first principle is that people are abiding by Australian law, so we need  to look at for example, whether or not people have been involved in gang violence,  whether or not there's information in relation to criminal activity or…

DAVID SPEERS:

…but surely at the moment if you've engaged in criminal activity and been convicted  of such, can you become an Australian citizen?

PETER DUTTON:

Well you can become an Australian citizen even with a criminal history at the  moment. So this is a significant tightening of that arrangement.

DAVID SPEERS:

So any criminal conviction, you're out? Or you don't get citizenship?

PETER DUTTON:

No, I think we can look at the individual circumstances. So I think what's important to  consider here is, you know the true facts, all of the facts in relation to an individual  application. So it may mean that somebody who's convicted of a minor offence many  years ago is viewed very differently than an offence of sexual assault or stalking, for  example, or armed robbery. I think we need to be serious that…

DAVID SPEERS:

…and domestic violence?

PETER DUTTON:

And domestic violence is included.

DAVID SPEERS:

So any domestic violence would disqualify you from Australian citizenship?

4

www.minister.border.gov.au

PETER DUTTON:

It would likely disqualify you from Australian citizenship - and so it should - but again  the decision makers - as they do now with every visa application, with the 130,000  applications that are dealt with each year and people become Australian citizens  now - the decision makers within the Department look at the information available in  relation to each applicant and then make a decision based on those facts.

DAVID SPEERS:

And of course those who don't have a conviction, but may have been involved in  beating their wife or kids, as you acknowledged this morning, they may still lie on the  test, right? They may still say; no I don't do that and yes I agree you shouldn't do  that. That doesn't mean that some won't slip through the net?

PETER DUTTON:

Well of course, but that is not an argument for not applying that standard in the first  place. We have a problem, like any other country, with domestic violence. There is a  lot of work the Government's…all of us are doing to address that scourge. This is not  specific to any race or ethnic background, this is a problem across society and I think  there should be a very clear message - this is one element of what we're talking  about in terms of somebody's character or signing up to an Australian value - it is  not part of who we are as a country for men to treat women poorly or to abuse  sexually women or children within their own family.

DAVID SPEERS:

So if someone passes the test and then does beat their wife, can they have their  citizenship revoked?

PETER DUTTON:

If there is a fraudulent application and somebody pledges or gives an undertaking  that they haven't committed criminal offences or they haven't been convicted…

DAVID SPEERS:

How do you prove that?

PETER DUTTON:

Well, it may well be that there is information that comes to light, a complaint that's  made, subsequent evidence that surfaces; doctor's reports, whatever it might be -  and whether it's domestic violence or some other crime - so there are provisions  under the Act now in certain circumstances where citizenship can be revoked.

But David, this is the reason why we need to get the decision to grant citizenship  right before the conferral takes place because once somebody becomes an  Australian citizen, rightly, that person regardless of their background is protected

5

www.minister.border.gov.au

under our constitution. We can't render somebody stateless and we can't having  issued citizenship to somebody, then turn around and say; you know geez, we  should have been more thorough in our checks on that individual.

I think what we're saying here is that we do want to be more thorough and we want  to make sure that those people that go on to become Australian citizens, share the  values, abide by the laws, treat their wife well, send their kids to school, are working,  all of that I think makes up the complete picture.

DAVID SPEERS:

What about some other values: religious tolerance, is that one of them? Non-discrimination on the grounds of religion?

PETER DUTTON:

Yes, and look the point that I’d make in relation to values is that we have said that  we are going to put out for discussion that element of our decision today, our  announcement today, so that people…I mean people may well have aspects that  they think should be included for consideration…

DAVID SPEERS:

…well indeed, and I'm just wondering as Minister, what you're starting point here is?  If you agree religious tolerance is one of them; does that mean including respect for  people to follow the religion of their choice, including Islam and not labelling that  religion, for example, a disease as some Australian, as one Australian politician has.  Is that in line with Australian values?

PETER DUTTON:

Well I think people can…others that have made public comments can talk to their  own comments. And there is a different standard for somebody who wants to  become an Australian citizen, as opposed to somebody that is an Australian citizen  in terms of their expression of views - and we're not talking about taking citizenship  off people - what we are saying is that absolutely we have as a fundamental belief in  our system freedom of speech, freedom of religion and people can…

DAVID SPEERS:

…is it therefore fair to say there is a higher bar for those who want to become  Australian citizens than perhaps those born Australian citizens?

PETER DUTTON:

Well if your point is that if you're, you know, through hereditary links able to become  an Australian citizen as a birth right, well of course because somebody is born with  that right …

DAVID SPEERS:

…we don't have to sit the test. We don't have to agree to non-discrimination on the  grounds of religion or anything else.

PETER DUTTON:

Well because the argument otherwise would be that you don't confer citizenship on  Australian-born individuals regardless of their…

DAVID SPEERS:

…I'm just saying there is a higher bar though for those who want  to…

PETER DUTTON:

…well by definition is my point. Unless your argument is that we should not have a  birth right conferral of citizenship, which of course will be nonsense.

DAVID SPEERS:

Not at all. What about non-discrimination on the grounds of sexuality?

PETER DUTTON:

Yes.

DAVID SPEERS:

Is that something you want in the test as well? You should respect the right of  Australians to be gay, straight, transgender, whatever.

PETER DUTTON:

Of course, of course.

DAVID SPEERS:

Will that be in the test?

PETER DUTTON:

I think that's…we're open to that suggestion. We haven't included that in the test, but  we have spoken about freedom of expression of interest and that is fundamental  within that.

DAVID SPEERS:

What about…and you talk about the working age; 16 to 60. Some requirement for  them to show that they are at least trying to work, paying tax, does that mean that

7

www.minister.border.gov.au

those who are solely dependent on welfare, be it the unemployment disability  pension, whatever, they can't apply?

PETER DUTTON:

If somebody is of working age and they have the ability, the capacity to work, but  they're choosing not to work, then that is somebody who is not adopting an  Australian value. An Australian value is to work hard, provide for your children,  provide for your family. That is a fundamental aspect of who we are and if people are  taking a decision that they want to come to our country or become an Australian  citizen - because we have one of the most generous welfare systems in the world -  that doesn't make them eligible to become an Australian citizen.

So adherence to tax laws, adherence to social security laws, the fact that they have  been gainfully employed if they have a capacity to do so, is fundamental. If  somebody has an incapacity or an inability to work, if they're on a disability support  pension and they don't have a capacity to work, well that is a very different  proposition.

DAVID SPEERS:

Can I turn to the 457 visa announcement from earlier in the week; scrapping the  programme replacing it with something with much tighter rules? Most employers  seem to be comfortable with the change to restore community support for the  scheme. Labor's raised some concerns around the labour market testing. Now  explain to me how this will work under the new scheme?

PETER DUTTON:

Alright; I mean it's almost farcical the Labor approach here. Now we've had Tanya  Plibersek saying that this is a sledgehammer approach. We've had Bill Shorten  saying this is window dressing. We've had Jim Chalmers and Andrew Leigh and  others out there. I think Ed Husic was out yesterday saying that there's some  independent commission required, couldn't provide any detail. It was a thought  bubble of the highest order. So what it demonstrates is that Labor is all over the shop  on this.

Now part of the reason of course is that unions were big utilisers of 457 visas. They  don't want to talk about that, but they were. Now, for them to talk about labour  market testing when under the 457 programme, administered by Mr Shorten as  Employment Minister in the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd years, there was no test. So they had  six years in government where they could have applied market testing. They didn't.  And what happened was there was a doubling of the number of 457 visas issued  when Mr Shorten was a Minister in the Labor Government.

So for them to come out now and say that our tightening around labour market  testing is inadequate is a farce and it's a joke and it's a political stunt. So what we've  said is that we will adhere to Free Trade Agreements. We will adhere to Australian  law otherwise, of course.

DAVID SPEERS:

And remind us what that includes for the China Free Trade Agreement?

PETER DUTTON:

So in some of the agreements that Australia has or could enter into, there may be  exemption and there was some debate as you’d recall about this at the time of the  Free Trade Agreement about some classifications, some industries, etc. So the  detail of that is all within the agreement.

DAVID SPEERS:

Just in simple terms, a Chinese firm, for example, wouldn't have to do labour market  testing. They could bring in Chinese employees?

PETER DUTTON:

In certain circumstances that is possible. Now it's not the norm across the board by  any stretch, but what we've said is that Labor's system had no labour market testing  at all and what we are saying is that Australian employers, sponsors of 457 visa  holders, need to test the market; they need to advertise, they need to prove that they  can't get an Australian for that Australian job. That is the default position. That's the  mandated position and that is a very significant tightening on what Labor had  presided over for six years - so for them to lecture us now, frankly, is a little  disingenuous.

DAVID SPEERS:

Okay. The concern has always been that some employers don't really test the  market. They say they do. Your Department, what's it going to do? Keep a check on  this?

PETER DUTTON:

Absolutely and it will tighten up on it. We have compliance activities already. We've  ramped that up and we will continue to do that and people who do the wrong thing -  either employees or employers - well, they will have their visas cancelled or they  won't be sponsoring somebody into a visa again. So already we have ramped up that  activity, but we will do more.

DAVID SPEERS:

A couple of quick ones just finally. Manus Island; there was an incident on Friday  there where members of the PNG Defence Force allegedly fired shots at the  detention centre after a fight with asylum seekers. Do you know much more about  this?





9

www.minister.border.gov.au

PETER DUTTON:

My understanding is that the Commissioner of Police in PNG as well as the Defence  Force Chief are conducting an investigation in relation to the matter. So I think we're  best to wait to see what that uncovers.

There was difficulty, as I understand it, in the community. There was an alleged  incident where three asylum seekers were alleged to be leading a local five year old  boy back toward the facility and there was a lot of angst around that, if you like,  within the local PNG community.

DAVID SPEERS:

Why was there angst about that?

PETER DUTTON:

Well because I think there was concern about why the boy was being led or for what  purpose he was being led away back into the regional processing centre. So I think  it's fair to say that the mood had elevated quite quickly. I think some of the local  residents were quite angry about this particular incident and another alleged sexual  assault.

So again, I don't have the full details and those matters are under investigation, but  there had been an elevation in the tempo if you like on the ground.

But I’d make this point; I mean it's unacceptable if firearms have been discharged  unlawfully. That is unacceptable by anybody's standard.

DAVID SPEERS:

Is it a safe place?

PETER DUTTON:

Well, it's a difficult place because people don't want to stay in PNG. They've come on  a people smuggling boat. They've paid their money. They want to come to Australia.  We've said they are not going to settle here. So people understandably; some of  them will act out, some are refusing to accept settlement packages to go back to  their country of origin - even though hundreds before them have done so - and  essentially some of them are doubling down on the advice of advocates that look,  the Government will bend and they will come to Australia and we've been very clear  that they're not.

So in that environment it is difficult for people because they've paid their $10,000 or  whatever it was to a people smuggler and they want to come here, but we aren't  going to allow that to happen.

DAVID SPEERS:

And final one; Tony Abbott, he's been again warning this week that Labor's going to  win the next election unless his five point plan is put in place. It includes ideas in  your portfolio space, cutting immigration to help with the housing market he says.  What do you think of that idea?

PETER DUTTON:

We've brought the number down if you like. It was over 300,000 net figure per year  under Kevin Rudd. It is this year at about 190,000 or so, but again the programme as  the Prime Minister's pointed out in the last couple of days - as was the case under  Tony when he was Prime Minister - the programme is designed to act in our national  interest. When the economy is humming along and when there's demand in the  mining sector and elsewhere, we will get more people coming to work here because  labour will chase opportunity and that's understandable and numbers will go up. In  downturns in the economy, there will be less demand under the programme.

DAVID SPEERS:

And Tony Abbott presumably knows all this?

PETER DUTTON:

Of course. Of course and…

DAVID SPEERS:

Why is he saying we need to cut…

PETER DUTTON:

…well he's right to point out that a large number of people under the streams, the  visa streams, end up living in Sydney and Melbourne predominantly; Brisbane as  well, to a lesser extent the other states and territories.

DAVID SPEERS:

So do you need to cut the intake further?

PETER DUTTON:

I don't believe that we do, but again I think we should be driven by what's in our  national interest. So I think it's appropriate for Tony to be adding to the public debate.  He's a former Prime Minister…

DAVID SPEERS:

…you don't have a problem with what he's doing…

11

www.minister.border.gov.au

PETER DUTTON:

…he's well respected by his colleagues. I think he's well respected by people and he  has said his comments in this context, this very important context; he does not want  Bill Shorten to be the next prime minister of our country and he wants us to embrace  policies which will allow us to win the next election. I think he should be applauded  for that. So I don't have any issue...

DAVID SPEERS:

…and your colleague Mathias Cormann a couple of months ago called it pretty sad  what he was doing…

PETER DUTTON:

No, but that was in a different context. Mathias responded to particular comments  that were made that went to a different debate and a different context if you like.  What Tony's talking about in his contribution that he made in the last week or so, I  think is all designed at trying to make sure that Bill Shorten doesn't win the next  election. That's what all of us are about because it would be a disaster for the  economy. It would be bad for families and small businesses and it's not what our  country needs at the moment. We don't need a Daniel Andrews-style government  where the CFMEU is effectively running the country.

DAVID SPEERS:

Immigration Minister Peter Dutton, good to talk to you.

PETER DUTTON:

Thanks David. Thank you.
