PRESS CONFERENCE   SATURDAY, 20 JULY 2013



TONY BURKE:                        Okay, thanks very much everybody for coming  in.  Obviously  yesterday's  announcement  and   the  arrangement  which  is  now  in  place  is   something  that  I  want  to  give  you  some   further updates on. I want to do in parts. First  of all to refer to the first vessel which has now  been intercepted which has passengers where  the  new  arrangement  will  apply.  Secondly,  to   refer to  the  events  overnight  on  Nauru  and   thirdly,  to  make  some  comments  about  the   communications  in  advertising  campaign   which  has  now  commenced.  Obviously  there   may  be  further  issues  than  that  that  come  up   during questions.

In  terms  of  the  first  vessel.  There  were  two

vessels  yesterday.  One  was  intercepted  just   before  we  began  the  media  conference  and   the  signing  by  the  two  Prime  Ministers.  The   second  vessel  was  actually  intercepted  during   the  period  that  the  signing  was  taking  place.   Neither  of  those  vessels  have  the  new   arrangement  apply  to  them.  In  the  very  early

hours  of  this  morning,  a  further  vessel  was   intercepted  containing  in  the  order  of  81   passengers  plus  crew.  That  vessel  will  be  the   first vessel where those on board will have the  new  arrangements  apply  to  them.  Once  in   Christmas  Island  when  the  interviews

commence,  people  will  be  informed  of  the   new arrangements. If they make a choice, that  they  in  fact  do  not  wish  to  seek  asylum  and   they  wish  to  return to  another  country,  they   will  be  assisted  in  terms  of  travel  documents   and whatever help's required to allow them to  do so.

If  they  do  want  to  pursue  asylum  claims,  then

they  will  be  dealt  with  under  the  new

arrangement.  Their  processing  will  take  place   in  accordance  with  the  Refugees'  Convention.   Their accommodation and care will take place  according to the standards of decency that are  expected  under  the  convention.  But  that   processing and potential ultimate settlement if  they  have  successful  claims  will  take  place   under  the  new  arrangement.  If  they  have   successful  claims  for  asylum  then  they  will  be   taken to a place where they will not be subject  to  persecution,  where  they  have  proper   accommodation, needs being looked after and  where there are proper services in place.

Under no circumstances though will that place

be  Australia.  For  those  who've  arrived,  who   are  now  being  considered  under  the  new   arrangement,  any  settlement  for  them  will   take  place  in  a  country  other  than  Australia   and  the  intention  will  be  that  they  will  be

considered  under  the  new  arrangements   within Papua New Guinea.

In terms of the events overnight in Nauru. The

specifics of Nauru are still emerging. There are  initial reports, investigations, later reports and  I don't want to start going through every piece  of  minutiae  of  detail  whence  some  of  those   investigations  as  to  the  full  detail  of  what  has   occurred  on Nauru overnight  is  still  emerging.   Be  in  no  doubt  there  will  be  criminal

investigations under the law of Nauru. Be in no  doubt that the sort of crimes which appear to  have  been  committed  are  crimes  which  carry   serious  prison  sentences.  And  the  fact  that   people are in Nauru for processing does not in  any way excuse them from the criminal law of  Nauru.

In  terms  of  final  decisions  on  their  refugee

claim,  there  are  two  separate  matters  up  for   consideration.  One  is  whether  or  not  people   have a valid claim for asylum. The second issue  is  the  right  of  an  Immigration  Minister  to   cancel  or  refuse  visas  based  on  the  character   test.  Now  I  can't  prejudge  that  test  before   individual  applications  come  to  me.  If  I  do  it   simply  creates  a  legal  problem  with  the   possible  overturning  of  my  decision.  But  I   don't  think  it  will  take  much  guessing  for   people  to  work  out  how  incidences  such  as   what we've seen overnight in Nauru reflect on  character. And character gives rise to the right  of refusal of visas or cancellation of visas.

The  third  issue  I  want  to  deal  with  is  the

communication  strategy.  I  have  been  shocked   by  the  objections  that  have  come  from  my   political  opponents  today - in  particular  the   Twitter  comments  that  have  been  put  out  by   Joe Hockey who wants to put himself forward  as  an  alternative  Treasurer.  He  has  described   the advertising campaign as a waste of money.  I think the Liberal and National Parties need to  come up to date with the fact that it might not  have been quite as big in 2001 but now there  are  things  called  Facebook.  Now  there  are   things called social media and now we  have a  situation  where  overwhelmingly  people  who   are  paying  people  smugglers  and  finding  a   pathway  to  our  shores  are  in  contact  with   people in Australia.

To make sure that the message is out loud and

clear  within  Australia  is  a  way  of  making  sure   that  the  message  is  heard  the  whole  way  up   the  pipeline.  I  at  present  have  authorised   expenditure  within  Australia  of  $2.1  million.  I   don't resile from the fact that it is very likely I  will  approve  more  expenditure  on  that   campaign.  Because  it  is  critically  important  -  critically  important,  that  the  message  get  the   whole  way  up  the  pipeline  and  part  of  the   communications that happen to people within  that pipeline are communications that happen  with people who are resident within Australia.  And I want the text messages they send back, I  want  the  phone  calls  they  send  back,  I  want   the  chat-rooms  and  the  conversations  they   have  through  social  media  to  send  the   message loud and clear that if people arrive by

boat  without  a  visa,  they  will  be  dealt  with   according to the convention.

They  will  be  looked  after.  They  will  be

appropriately  housed  but  they  will  not  be   settled  within  Australia.  That  is  what  the  new   arrangement  is  about  and  I  want  people  to   know about it. There is an additional campaign  which  is  specifically  taking  place  itself

internationally  and  that  campaign  is  run  by  a   different  Minister.  The  domestic  campaign  is   dealt  with  by  me.  Jason  Clare's  the  relevant   Minister  to  be  able  to  answer  questions  with   respect  to  the  campaign  that  happens   internationally.  As  well  as  what  people  have   seen  in  the  English-speaking  press,  there  is  a   range  of  communications  messages  that  are   going  out  through  ethnic  community  press  as   well.

This will have a particular emphasis but will not

be  limited  to,  but  a  particular  emphasis  on   campaigns aimed at reaching people who form  a  large  part  of  the  current  caseload:  Afghans,   Pakistanis,  Iraqis,  Iranians,  Sri  Lankans  and   Vietnamese.  I  want  people  to  know  before   they pay a people smuggler. That if what they  are  seeking  is  freedom  from  persecution  then   that will be found for them in accordance with  the  Refugee  Convention  in  a  place  other  than   Australia,  in  this  situation,  in  Papua  New   Guinea. If what they want is simply to move to  a country which has a higher average income,  then  that's  not  what  the  Refugee  Convention   is for.

That's what the orderly immigration process is

for.  And  that's  why  people  make  applications   offshore.  Out  of  all  of  this  and  this  is  why  I   make  no  apology  for  spending  money  on   communications  to  make  sure  the  message  is   heard - if  we  end  up  seeing  a  marked

reduction  in  the  number  of  vessels;  if  we  end   up  seeing  success  in  the  international

cooperation  that  the  Prime  Minister  announced yesterday, with respect to

improving  cooperation  for  the  convention

nations,  for  both  transit  and  destination   countries;  if  that  happens  then  Australia   becomes  a  country  that  is  able  to  extend a  more generous hand in finding new homes for  some  of  the  most  desperate  people  in  the   world.

But we'll find the most desperate people in the

world  in  partnership  with  the  United  Nations   agencies, in partnership with the international  agencies - not on a self-selection process with  people smugglers. That is the better approach,  is  the  safer  approach  and  it  is  the  more   humanitarian approach.

QUESTION:                            With regards to the boat arrival that will come  under the new agreement, can you tell us are  there  any  women  and  children  on  board  that   boat and will they be going to Manus Island or  will they be processed offshore?

TONY  BURKE:                         The  current  vessel  from  the  first  information  we  have  and  sometimes  this  information   changes  is  - consists  either  entirely  or  almost   entirely  of  people  who  have  originally  come   from Iran. It is a mixture of single adult males  and of family groups. We - I’m not yet able to  tell you whether any of the children on board  are  unaccompanied  or  whether  they  all  have   an  adult  guardian  with  them.  The  - sorry  I’m   describing it first then I want to make sure that  I  do  answer  the  question.  At  the  moment   facilities  on  Manus  Island  in  my  view  are  not   ready to be able to take family groups or to be  able  to  take  unaccompanied  minors.  My

intention  and  the  work  I’m  doing  with  Papua   New Guinea is to make sure that before long it  is  the  case  that  minors  and  family  groups  are   able to be transferred there.

At the moment those individuals will remain on

Christmas Island and as soon as I believe we’re  able  to  have  appropriate  accommodation  and   services,  then  transfer  to  Papua  New  Guinea   will occur.

QUESTION:                            How long do you estimate that those facilities  will take to be built?

TONY  BURKE:                         Look,  the  reason  I’m  not  setting  arbitrary

deadlines  is  my  priority  is  in  making  that   decision  is  not  a  time  limit,  it’s  a  welfare   decision.  And  in  - particularly  if  you  have   unaccompanied  children,  I’m  not  just  the   Minister  responsible,  I’m  their  legal  guardian   and  I  take  that  responsibility  very  seriously.   The transfer - the intention is that the facilities  will  be  brought  up  to  standard,  that  it  is   appropriate  accommodation  and  appropriate   services and the transfers will occur when that  threshold’s been met.

QUESTION:                            Is there an issue for children under the age of

seven  as  regards  to  immunisation  going  to  be  PNG?

TONY BURKE:                          It can in part depend on what parts of Papua  New  Guinea  you’re  going  to  and  all  of  these   welfare issues are part of the decision-making  process.

QUESTION:                            Okay,  just  to  clarify,  families,  women  and

children - they  will  stay  at  Christmas  Island   and the single men will head off to PNG in the  meantime?

TONY  BURKE:                         Everybody  will  end  up  if  they  have  a

settlement outcome, everybody will end up in  Papua  New  Guinea.  The  people  for  whom  I   believe  the  facilities  are  ready  to  go  now   without  any  doubt  are  the  single  adult  males.   And  as  facilities  are  improved,  then  more   groups will be able to go.

QUESTION:                            The  Opposition  says  that  while  much  was

made  of  the  actual  signing  of  the  agreement,   we’re yet to see the actual agreement and the  details  in  that  agreement.  Are  you  going  to   release those details and are we going to find  out the constants involved in this process and  how will it all unfold?

TONY  BURKE:                         Okay.  The  agreement’s  on  the  internet.  The   costs  will  depend  on  how  many  people  come   and  we  and  as  you  know  the  nature  of  this   agreement, this arrangement with Papua New  Guinea,  is  one  where  we  don’t  have  a  cap  on   the  numbers,  and  therefore  there  will  be   people  smuggler  who  decide  to  test  our   resolve.  They  will  discover  that  we  are   implementing  this  arrangement  and  the  costs   of it will depend on how many people chose to  test  our  resolve.  But  the  outcome  for  each  of   them will be the same.

QUESTION:                            Will  there  be  any  concerns  raised  within  the

Labor  Party  among  some  members  that  they   may have concerns about this new plan?

TONY  BURKE:                         Oh,  there’s  no  doubt  people  - this  is

considered  a  hardline  decision  and  it’s   controversial.  No  doubt  about  that  and  that   controversy  extends  within  the  Labor  Party.  I   don’t doubt that for a minute. It’s also the case  that no-one should view this as being a choice  between  compassion  and  pragmatism.  There   is nothing compassionate in children drowning  at  sea,  there  is  nothing  compassionate  in   people waiting in refugee camps for more than  a  decade  while  other  people  who  might  not   have  a  valid  asylum  claim  get  processed   immediately.  Those  are  not  compassionate   options. We’re making sure that we take away  the  product  that  people  smugglers  sell.  The   product  that  they  are  extorting  money  from   people  for  is  residence  in  Australia.  Now,  the   Liberal  Party  through  temporary  protection   visas do offer residence in Australia. The Papua  New Guinea arrangement does not.

QUESTION:                            What  do  you  make  of  comments  from  Tony

Abbott  today  saying  that  if  he  was  Prime   Minister  he  wouldn’t  be  subcontracting  out   these  asylum  seekers  and  that  we  would  find   an  Australian  solution  to  an  Australian   problem?

TONY BURKE:                        Tony Abbott is potentially the first person on  our  planet  to  describe  refugees  as  not  being   an  international  issue.  By  their  very  definition   refugees  cross  borders  and  are  an

international  issue.  This  is  new  from  Tony   Abbott  but  I  guess  he’s  looking  for  something   to say. The issue of his approach which would  save  for  this  exact  caseload,  he’d  deal  with   them in Australia. And that’s what he says with  temporary  protection  visas.  So  his  sense  is   instead  of  saying  that  we  take  the  people   smugglers  product  away  by  saying  you’re  not   selling  residence  in  Australia,  he  says  well  we   will  give  residence  in  Australia,  it’ll  be

temporary  residence  and  we’ll  just  keep   renewing  the  visas  and  people  can  live  and   work here.

No  wonder  when  temporary  protection  visas

were  introduced  last  time,  the  number  of   people getting on boats went up.  No wonder.  So  temporary  protection  visas  has  the   opposite  impact  if you’re  wanting  to  do   something  about  the  number  of  people   putting  their  lives  at  risk  on  the  high  seas.   Turning around boats increases the actual risk  on  the  high  seas  and  you  don’t’  have  the   cooperation of Indonesia. I can’t for the life of  me  see  how  Tony  Abbott  can  say  any  of  his   policies are more effective than what has now  been agreed in this regional arrangement.

QUESTION:                            In relation to Nauru, can you confirm some of

the  details  we’ve  got  from  the  Immigration   Department  that  the  riots  caused  $50  million   worth  of  damage,  that  some  of  the  people   have been transferred to a police watch-house  those  that  were  involved  in  the  riot  and   there’s  fires  and  quite  large  destruction  of

property. Can you confirm any of those details  [in audible]?

TONY BURKE:                        On the information coming from Nauru, I have  asked  that  you  receive  the  identical  briefing   that  I’ve  received.  And  that’s  way  the

department’s been providing that information.  The reason that I don’t want to go through it in  chapter  and  verse  is  simply  sometimes  some   of  the  information  changes  over  time  and  I   want to make sure that anything that’s coming  to you personally from me, I’ve gone through a  longer  period  of  verification  than  what’s   possible providing that information right now.   But  certainly,  there  is  no  difference  between   what  you’ve  got  descried  and  how  I’ve  been   briefed.

QUESTION:                            The  Queensland  Premier  Campbell  Newman   says he’s got concerns about the PNG plan and  has asked the Prime Minister to confirm extra  border  security  around  the  Torres  Strait.  Is   that something that you would consider?

TONY BURKE:                        I reckon in terms of hysterical responses Tony  Abbott  and  Scott  Morrison  are  on  the  board   but  Campbell  Newman  probably  wins.  He’s   effectively  complaining  about  the  geographic   location of Papua New Guinea. It’s been there  for  a  long  time.  There  have  been  refugees   from different countries in Papua New Guinea  for  a  very  long  time  and  we  haven’t  had  a   problem  across  the  Torres  Strait.  If  Campbell   Newman  objects  to  the  geographical  location   of  Papua  New  Guinea,  I’m  not  sure  we  can   help  him  with  that.  Certainly,  the  settlement

locations  that  we’ll  be  working  through,  we   haven’t  been  discussing  locations  on  the  Torres  Strait  - but  notwithstanding  that  there   hasn’t  been  a  problem  and  the  idea  here  is   that  if  people  arrive  unlawfully  without  a  visa   by  boat,  they  will  be  sent  to  Papua  New   Guinea.  So  if  people  came  across  the  Torres   Strait,  by  boat  without  a  visa, they  would  be   sent  back  to  Papua  New  Guinea.  It’s  real   desperation from Campbell Newman this one.

QUESTION:                            Minister,  you  say  with  the  latest  boat  arrival,

they’re at Christmas Island at the moment and  if they choose not to seek asylum they can be  sent  to  another  country.  Will  Australia  just   send them home or will they be able to go to a  country of their choosing?

TONY BURKE:                        Oh, look if they say to us they’re unaware of

the  policy  and  they  would  like  to  get  their   travel  documents  and  pay  their  way  back   home or there’s another country they want to  visit,  if  someone’s  in  Australia  and  they  don’t   have  a  visa  and  they  want  to  leave,  we  let   them leave and we’re making sure that people  are told that and given that opportunity before  they  find  themselves  on  a  plane  across  to   Papua New Guinea.

QUESTION:                            With regards to the ad campaign, independent  Senator  Nick  Xenophon  says  he  believes  the   ads  could  be  in  breach  of  advertising

guidelines  that  it’s  not  what  government   advertising  should  be  about  and  that’s  a   blatant  use  of  taxpayers’  money  in  a  party   political way. How would you respond to that?

TONY  BURKE:                         He’s  wrong.  Nick  Xenophon’s  wrong.  It’s  as   simple  as  that.  It’s  incredibly  important  that   the  message  about  this  policy  gets  out.  If  it  is   true  then  let’s  not  forget  we  had  on  ABC  this   morning a people smuggler actually saying and  actually  doubting  whether  or  not  his  business   can now continue to run. We have a situation  where  if  this  message  gets  out  there  is  a  real   prospect that fewer people will put their lives  at  risk  on  the  high  seas.  I’m  willing  to  spend   money on that. There’s a real chance here that  people  will  go  back  to  proper  channels   through  the  United  Nations  and  we  can  then   make  sure  that  our  humanitarian  program  is   being  used  to  target  those  most  in  need.  I’m   prepared  to  spend  money  on  that.  I  want  the   message  to  get  out  and  I  want  there  to  be   fewer  people  drowning  on  the  high  seas.  I   make absolutely no apology for that and if the  advice  comes  back  that  more  advertising  will   help get that message out further, then I’ll be  authorising more.

QUESTION:                            How can the Australian public believe that the  Government  is  capable  of  implementing  this   new  policy  given  there’s  sort  of  several  years   old  of  changes  with  regards  to  asylum  seeker   policy?  Tried  attempts  - with  the  Malaysia   solution  which  failed.  Are  you  concerned   about any legal challenges and how will - can  you  confirm  to  the  public that  this  will  be   implemented [inaudible]?

TONY  BURKE:                         Well,  the  previous  regional  approach

ultimately  wasn’t  implemented  because  the   Liberal Party thought it was politically clever to

team  up  with  the  Greens  and  block  it.  And   that’s  partly  why  we  now  have  a  bigger   problem now than  we  had back then and just  as  we’ve  been  completely  up-front  at  owning   the  fact  that  we  take  responsibility  for  not   acting as quickly as we should’ve in 2009. I’ve  yet to see Tony Abbott or Scott Morrison take  any responsibility for what they did in teaming  up  with  the  Greens.  And  they  own  that   responsibility  quite  personally.  Because  they   knew  what  the  outcome  was  going  to  be  if   they  did  that.  We’ve  made  sure  that  for  the   High  Court  guidance  that  was  given  in  the   Malaysia decision that we have taken account  of  each  of  their  objections  in  the  way  this   arrangement  has  been  put  together.  That’s   why  it’s  so  important  that  Papua  New  Guinea   have agreed to remove all of their reservations  on the Refugee Convention with respect to the  people  who  are  transferred  from  Australia  to   Papua  New  Guinea.  That’s  why  it’s  important   that  I’ve  been  saying  that  I’m  not  going  to   move  people  there  until  I’m  comfortable  -  until  I’m  comfortable  that  for  each  cohort  we   have adequate accommodation and services in  place.  We’re  making  sure  that  each  of  the   principles  that  the  High  Court  asked  us  to   observe, are being observed.

QUESTION:                            Why  now,  why  has  the  Government

announced the policy now, why not two, three  months ago?

TONY BURKE:                   Well, we’ve announced it once agreement came  through  from  Papua  New  Guinea.  And  that   agreement - my understanding  was  it  went

through their Cabinet midweek or it may have  been  Wednesday,  it  may  have  been  Thursday   for  that  - I  think  it  was  Wednesday  for  their   Cabinet  process  and  we  then  signed  the   agreement - the  two  Prime  Ministers  signed   the agreement and stood up and announced in  it  immediately.  You  couldn’t  announce  it  until  it  had  been  agreed.  And  this  is  one  of  the   differences  in  the  way  we  operate  to  the   megaphone  approach  of  those  opposite.   Those  opposite  - you  look  at  my  counterpart   and  he’s  so  proud  of  his  rhetoric.  He’ll  throw   the  words  Kardashian  or  wrecker  or  Rudd   carpet  and  think  oh  cute  line,  how  clever  is   this?  This  is  serious  business,  we’re  actually   talking  about  the  integrity  of  our  immigration   program. We’re actually talking about a policy  where under the Howard Government at times  and  under  us  people  drown  at  sea  and  lives   get  lost  forever.  This  is  a  policy  that  is  not   there for cute lines or slogans. There’s actually  a  lot  at  stake  and  there  are  people  who  have   their  lives  cut  tragically  short  when  these   policies  don’t  have  their  full  impact.  The   approach  of  the  Opposition  I  cannot  fathom   given  the  seriousness  of  this  issue  that  every   time I hear a Scott Morrison media conference  I’m  reminded  of  the  fact  that  they  enjoy  the   politics of this one a bit too much.

And similarly the approach with Indonesia. Just

the  announcing  of  sending  back  the  boats,   that’s  what  they’ll  do.  Having  meetings  with   Indonesia  and  then  refusing  to  discuss  the   policy  with  them.  We  had  a  great  outcome   from Indonesia with respect to visas on arrival

from  Iran.  Now  that  wasn’t  trumpeted  or   shouted  from  the  rooftops,  it  was  something   that  Indonesia  subsequently  said  was

something  they  were  doing  as  part  of  their   cooperating  with  Australia.  Similarly  with   Papua  New  Guinea  we  worked  the

conversations through quietly. When we came  back on  Monday,  the  Prime  Minister  from   Papua New Guinea, Scott Morrison was - and  Tony  Abbott  were  all  across  the  media  saying   oh, they’ve come back with nothing, look, this  is  a  disaster,  they’re  all  talk.  And  then  look   shell-shocked  when  because  we  dealt  with  things  diplomatically,  and  courteously,  and   respectfully  we’ve  ended  up  with  an

arrangement  that  may  have  an  extraordinary   impact.

QUESTION:                          Are you now confident that this agreement will  perhaps reduce the impact of this issue that it  might have had in the lead-up to the election?

TONY  BURKE:                       When  we’re  talking  about  lives  at  stake  to  be   honest,  I’m  not  spending  any  time  thinking   about  the  politics  of  it.  This  is  serious.  Okay.   Thank you very much.
