BOLKUS' BOATPEOPLE APPROACH QUESTIONED

IMEA37/95

The arrival of another 37 boatpeople today, believed to be from Southern China,  further highlights that, despite Senator Bolkus' belated but much publicised  efforts to stem the tide, the message is not getting through.

Is this the start of a further influx ofboatpeople?

Last year more than 900 boatpeople arrived on our shores. Some 700 of these  were Sino Vietnamese from Southern China. They prompted belated action from  the Minister to both stem the flow, and return them to Southern China. It now  appears that he is failing on both fronts.

Of last year's 700 arrivals, only 53 have been returned, and just this week. This is  despite Senator Bolkus' iron clad agreement with China facilitating the return.  This agreement, which seemingly he had to make an emergency dash to China  last month to save, is over three months old, yet less than 8 o/o of the boatpeople  have been returned. The rest remain in detention, at a cost to the Australian  taxpayer of$ 1 million each month.

Today's arrival ofboatpeople is very significant. They are the first group of  boatpeople allegedly to leave Southern China since the return agreement, which  was supposed to act as a major deterrent to new boat arrivals, was signed.

Clearly Senator Bolkus has failed to get the message through as forcibly as  required.
