TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW - CHANNEL 10 MORNING NEWS WITH NATARSHA  BELLING AND SCOTT MORRISON

SUBJECT:  GLOBAL ECONOMY; IMMIGRATION; KEVIN RUDD; FINANCE MINISTER  OF THE YEAR AWARD.

E  & O E - PROOF ONLY

BELLING: We’re joined once more for our weekly debate by Finance Minister Penny Wong  in Canberra, and shadow immigration minister Scott Morrison right here in the studio,  thanks once again for both joining us this morning.

MORRISON: G’day.

WONG: Morning Tarsh.

BELLING: Senator Wong if I can start with you, we have of course reported widely this  morning about this current economic crisis in Europe. There are now real fears of a serious  worldwide recession. Are we at risk here?

WONG: There’s certainly a lot of volatility on world markets, there’s certainly a lot of risk  aversion because markets are concerned about the European sovereign debt risks, and  those issues are weighing upon global markets. And Tarsh, whilst we’re not immune - we  aren’t immune - what I would say is this, that our economy is in very good nick. We had the  International Monetary Fund just recently commenting on the strength of the Australian  economy and how much better of a position we are in than other advanced economies.

But what I would say also is this: what this reminds us is that this is a time for clarity, policy  certainty - for responsible fiscal policies. And it is very concerning, given this backdrop, that  we see the Opposition, the shadow treasurer, walking away from a commitment to make  sure his election costings are transparent. Walking away from the Parliamentary Budget  Office, which is an initiative he previously supported.

And what I fear is that what we are seeing again is what we saw in the election campaign,  where the Coalition stuffed up their costings. They had an $11 billion black hole which they  sought to hide from the Australian people. This is not a time for responsible political parties  to hide their costings. This is a time for transparency.

BELLING: Senator Wong if I can just interrupt there, on exactly that point, you talk about  policy clarity. Considering the economic crisis we’re seeing overseas, what are we doing  concentrating on the asylum seeker issue? And there’s certainly no policy clarity there from  the Government on this issue. Shouldn’t we be focusing on the economic issues?

WONG: Tarsh, we wouldn’t need to focus on this if Scott and his colleagues would just be  responsible. We wouldn’t need to focus on this if the Opposition would accept a simple  proposition that the government of the day, whether it’s Labor or Liberal, has the right to  determine its processing regimes, whether they be regional, offshore, or onshore. That is  the proposition.

But what we see, regrettably, is extraordinary hypocrisy from the other side. Tony Abbott  used to beat his chest about how tough on asylum seeker policy he is, but now he’s signing  up with the Australian Greens to stop the government of the day resolving this issue -

BELLING: Scott if I can give you -

WONG: And that really shows an extraordinary level of hypocrisy.

BELLING: Can I give you the option to respond there, and I’d also say I think the majority  of the Australian public feels that both sides of politics are playing politics about this issue,  rather than looking after the humanity of people.

MORRISON: Look, this is a serious issue but let me make a couple of points. First of all on  the issue of the economy. I mean now is the last time in the world, given the uncertainty  that we’ve all spoken about, these are serious issues, that you’d be introducing the world’s  biggest carbon tax. That’s what this is about at the moment. And if the Government wants  to go ahead with the world’s biggest carbon tax, that’s their decision but we disagree with  that, obviously.

Look, on the issue of the asylum debate, the only reason we’re having this debate now is  because three and a half years ago, Kevin Rudd decided to abolish proven policies. And  since then, this Government has had a crisis of competence all the way through. And what  the Coalition has done in the Parliament this week has been to say, you can have the  power to offshore process in 148 countries. There needs to be a clear safeguard that has  always been in the Migration Act. We have always had a rock solid consistent policy on this  issue for a decade. It is the Government that has had every position except one that has  actually worked. They’ve had failure after failure after failure, crisis of competence, and now  they want to blame check for more failures. We’ve put up for a very reasonable  amendment; they have rejected it. It’s for the Government to get their legislation through.  Yesterday, they couldn’t get the support in the House of Representatives to vote for their  bill, and they’ve had to defer the debate for another few weeks. So the Government is  failing to get its own legislation now on this issue through the Parliament.

BELLING: Senator Wong, considering these current crises we’re talking about, the asylum  seeker issue and the economic crisis both here and overseas, and now you’ve got this  ongoing leadership speculation - the Labor Party is in crisis.

WONG: I don’t accept that at all. Can I just respond to one thing. Scott wants to talk about  the asylum seeker issue, and he wants to talk about the Refugee Convention. Just three  months ago, Scott said on television, and I’m quoting: ‘It was never our issue as to whether  they were a signatory to the Refugee Convention’.

MORRISON: Well I’m happy to respond to that Penny when -

WONG: Three months ago, let me finish Scott, three months ago, he argued a position that  is 180 degrees the opposite of the position he just put to you, and that Tony Abbott is  putting to the Parliament. And what I’d say to Australians is this, we want to resolve this  issue. We are prepared to be sensible about this. We’ve had a dialogue with the  Opposition.

But you see Tony Abbott and Scott Morrison, who are basically propping over to sit with the  Greens to knock off the Government amendments. What does that say to you about their  conviction around these issues?

MORRISON: If I can respond to that. Our point on the refugee convention is very  straightforward, Penny. The High Court as you know said that there has to be a clear  objective test about protections that need to be in place to send people offshore. Now  previously that was within the Migration Act. The High Court found that that was too  ambiguous and they’d set their own test. So if you want to have protections in the Migration  Act, then you have to have the Refugee Convention as the test. The Government doesn’t  want to do that. Their bill will see us back in the courts when they start wanting to send  people offshore again. Now we don’t want that, we want there to be a clear test, clear  protections. Now this Government is desperate and divided on this issue. Penny knows  that, she sat in her caucus room this week where we have the Left members once again  parade around outside the Parliament saying how they were going to take the Government  to task. What has happened in the Parliament this week is the Labor Party going to vote for  something that was their worst nightmare for a decade. And that will be on every member’s  conscience.

BELLING: Senator Wong.

WONG: I always think it’s interesting in these debates that Scott wants to talk so much  about the Labor Party and what’s inside the Labor Party, and it’s probably because it is  embarrassing for him to have to talk about the fact that Tony Abbott’s reversed his position  on this.

MORRISON: Not at all Penny -

WONG: And he’s going to be voting the same way as Bob Brown -

MORRISON: I think the desperation and the division is all on your side.

WONG: The same way as Bob Brown.

BELLING: The Labor Party is currently leading the nation though, Senator Wong, and I  need to ask the question -

WONG: Yes, please.

BELLING: There’s growing speculation about who is Prime Minister. Can you guarantee  the Australian public that Julia Gillard will remain Prime Minister up until the next election?

WONG: Julia Gillard is the Prime Minister, and the only people who are pushing this  speculation about the Labor Party is the Liberal Party. What we saw, yesterday’s reports in  the papers about Liberal Party members commenting on Labor Party matters, and  somehow that sort of speculation is a story. Frankly this is ridiculous -

MORRISON: That doesn’t sound like a guarantee to me, Penny.

WONG: You want a guarantee? I’ll give it. Absolutely.

MORRISON: OK.

WONG: And you know why? Because this is a woman who is tough, and clear, and  absolutely focused on the national interest which puts her in stark contrast, I regret to say,  with Tony Abbott.

MORRISON: The Government was saying all those things about Kevin Rudd, too, before  their midnight coup against the Prime Minister. The only person, frankly, who’s been sent  offshore by this Government is Kevin Rudd.

BELLING: Now in regards I guess Senator Wong, the concerning element is this is taking  the attention away from what’s important for the country, and there needs to be some  certainty with the ongoing leadership speculation.

WONG: What I’d say to you about that Tarsh is the people who are wanting that attention to  be on this issue are people like Scott, people like Tony Abbott.

BELLING: Or some may allege, Mr Rudd.

MORRISON: Kevin Rudd’s the one making the phone calls, Penny.

WONG: Hang on, but Tarsh, I’m very happy to come on this program. I’m very happy to talk  about the economy. I’m very happy to talk about our asylum seeker policy. I’m very happy  to talk about the fact that we have one of the strongest advanced economies on earth, as is  evidenced by the fact that we have Wayne Swan being given the award, the Euromoney  award, which is really an award for Australia. It is an award for the hard work of Australians,  and its Government in keeping this country out of recession. And those are things which are  much more important to the everyday lives of Australians than the sorts of things that  Scott’s going on about today.

BELLING: That is a very, very valid point.

MORRISON: I don’t disagree that the economy and all of these things are very important  Tarsh, but the problem is the Government has had a crisis of competence on all of these  issues. And the Australian people I think are sick and tired of a Government that simply  can’t get one thing right.

WONG: Crisis of competence? He’s just been awarded the world’s greatest finance  minister. I mean, really.

MORRISON: I’m talking about right across the board, Penny. We can go back to pink batts,  to school halls -

WONG: This is just the sort of negativity we always see.

MORRISON: We can go to the asylum seeker madness that’s been created under your  own policies. Now, Australians know that this Government has a competence problem, and  they’re worried about it. They’re worried about their future, and they do not feel as confident  about their future today as they did four years ago. And I think the Government’s  incompetence over so many measures has contributed to that. And I think that’s one of the  reasons why so many Australians do want to see an election, because they do want to see  competence and confidence back in the future of the country -

WONG: Tarsh, if I could just respond to that, please.

BELLING: Absolutely.

MORRISON: The Government is directionless, divided, and going nowhere.

BELLING: Senator Wong, we’ve got about two minutes left, I’m getting in trouble. (laughs)

WONG: All that was was a series of very negative words. There was no truth, and there  was nothing about the national interest. That’s what that contribution was. So let’s think  about where we are. As I’ve said, whilst Australia is not immune from what’s happening on  global markets, we are in a much stronger position than almost any other advanced  economy, and the reason is, we had a stimulus package that kept us out of recession. That  kept 200,000 Australians in jobs.

Now, I don’t mind if Scott wants to put forward alternative economic policies, but they don’t.  All they do is talk down the economy -

MORRISON: That’s not true, Penny. That’s just simply not true.

WONG: Talk down the economy, and hide their $70 billion black hole. That is not  responsible, at a time particularly when there’s so much global economic uncertainty.

BELLING: Penny Wong and Scott Morrison, I’m so terribly sorry but we have run out of  time, I’m in major trouble. We’ve gone way over time. Thanks so much for joining us Scott -

MORRISON: Thanks Tarsh, thanks Penny.

BELLING: Penny Wong, thank you so much.

WONG: Good to speak with you Tarsh.
