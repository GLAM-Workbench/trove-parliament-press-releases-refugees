E&OE……………………….…………………………………………………………………

LEON COMPTON:

Mr Abbott, good morning to you.

TONY ABBOTT:

Good morning.

LEON COMPTON:

Thank you for talking with us this morning. Some interest yesterday in your proposal for a jobs programme that it will involve  $3,000 or so going to bosses that employed long-term unemployed people. Would your programme money be on top of the

programmes that already exist to deal with the long-term unemployed?

TONY ABBOTT:

That’s absolutely correct, Leon. This is an additional programme for jobs in Tasmania bolted onto the existing assistance that’s  already there.

LEON COMPTON:

What do your projections tell you about when that would do for Tasmania’s unemployment rate?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well I’m reluctant to say that it would reduce the number of unemployed Tasmanians from 21,000 to 19,000 because we all know

that there are swings and roundabouts, but certainly this is my attempt to do something special for Tasmania, recognising the  particular circumstances that Tasmania is in. Unemployment in Tasmania over the last few years has been quite significantly

higher than elsewhere in Australia - 2.5 percentage points right now, it’s over eight per cent and look that’s just unacceptable. We  can’t just be complacent in the face of these sorts of figures and yesterday was the first instalment of what will be released next

week. The Coalition’s growth plan for Tasmania.

LEON COMPTON:

I want to play you a grab from Tasmania’s Premier Lara Giddings. She was talking about unemployment or employment earlier in  the week. This is what she had to say. Have a listen please.

LARA GIDDINGS:

There are some people who are making the choice not to take a job and in this climate, we need people to take employment on.

We need people to have the confidence then that with the employment they can make their savings, they can spend on things.  They can help the wider economy move.

LEON COMPTON:

Mr Abbott, in your time in Tasmania, do you think we have a problem with jobs being available and people just refusing to take

them?

TONY ABBOTT:

I’d be reluctant to say that Leon. I’m not saying that it’s never happened, but I think the vast, vast majority of people who are out of

work are trying to get work. People can always lift their game, but the fact is, there aren’t enough jobs, there aren’t enough  dynamic businesses in Tasmania and while we’ve got to work on programmes to get the unemployed into work, we’ve also got to

work on creating the kind of economic environment in which Tasmania can grow and that’s why getting rid of the carbon tax is  important. That’s why reducing the company tax is important. That’s why reducing red and green tape is so important.

LEON COMPTON:

Should Tasmania become a special economic zone? What did you mean yesterday when you used those words?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, what I meant was a special effort that recognises Tasmania’s particular circumstances. That’s why there will be from the

Coalition next week a full plan for growth - a growth plan for Tasmania and yesterday was the first instalment, but look, I’m not  talking about different tax rates and so-on because different Commonwealth tax rates would be contrary to the constitution.

LEON COMPTON:

So we will have three weeks then - three full weeks to have a look at the Liberal Party’s Tasmania package?

TONY ABBOTT:

That’s exactly right and look, I just want to stress to your listeners Leon that a vote for the Coalition is to build a stronger economy

so that everyone can get ahead, to scrap the carbon tax, to get the Budget under control, to build the roads of the 21st century  and to stop the boats.

LEON COMPTON:

I was at an interesting forum last night - a challenge there to the candidates for the seat of Denison to actually talk about issues

around foreign aid. Mr Abbott, if you’re elected, will you take the money that’s currently being siphoned from foreign aid to dealing  with asylum seekers in Australia and project that money back out and into international aid?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I’m very confident that we will stop the boats and we will do it well within three years and obviously if we stop the boats, we

won’t need to spend the $11 billion that this Government has spent on border protection blowouts, including as you say Leon,  money that they’ve taken out of the aid budget. So, I want to stop the boats. I will stop the boats and that will mean there’s more

money to spend on schools, on hospitals, on all of the other things that the Australian taxpayer’s dollar should be spent on,  including foreign aid.

LEON COMPTON:

Will that money that’s been taken out of the aid budget or diverted from the aid budget internally be moved back to external aid?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, we’ll tell you exactly what we’re spending and exactly how we’re funding it, including all of those issues in good time before

the election and I note that this is a Government which has played fast and loose with the aid budget and from memory, I think  Australia is now the third largest recipient, it might even be the second largest recipient of Australian foreign aid which just strikes

most fair-minded observers as bizarre.

LEON COMPTON:

Mr Abbott, why does it seem at the moment in this federal election campaign from all sides that Tasmania which has the worst  health outcomes, the greatest level of projected need and some of the biggest and the worst performance in health when you look

at elective surgery waiting lists that nobody is talking about health on the campaign trail?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I guess the Labor Party is embarrassed because they cut $1.5 billion out of public hospital funding including out of last

year’s Budget, even though we were half way through the year when they made the announcement. So, the Labor Party’s  embarrassed to talk about it and the Coalition has yet to release its detailed health policy.

LEON COMPTON:

When will you do that?

TONY ABBOTT:

We’ll do it in good time before polling day and the point I want to make is that if you look at my record as Health Minister, bulk

billing rates went up, spending went up, life expectancy went up and that’s what you can expect from a Coalition government in  Canberra.

LEON COMPTON:

Will you pledge to bring down the elective surgery waiting lists in Tasmania?

TONY ABBOTT:

In the end, the State Governments do run public hospitals. I’d like to see public hospital governance much more devolved to local

boards. I’d like to see local people exercising genuine responsibility over hospitals, including large hospitals and small hospitals,  because I think that the Board should appoint the CEO and the Board and the CEO together should be managing the hospital’s

budget rather than having the whole thing done by faceless bureaucrats.

LEON COMPTON:

Part of the problem clearly in health is the federal/state cost shifting blame game. Will you make a commitment to work with  whoever is in government in Tasmania to bring down elective surgery waiting lists?

TONY ABBOTT:

I certainly make a commitment to work with the states constructively to bring about a better public hospital system but I accept

that under our Constitution, the actual legal authority over public hospitals doesn’t rest with the Commonwealth it rests with the  states. I have had four years of experience in the health job, I know how frustrating it is for federal health ministers and indeed for

prime ministers, having to deal with these issues, but I think that in the time of the Howard Government when I was the Health  Minister we got it right more often than is happening now.

LEON COMPTON:

Tony Abbott is our guest this morning here on ABC local radio. Following Kevin Rudd’s recruitment, Mr Abbott of Peter Beattie in

Queensland, any chance you will be making a call to Ray Groom to have a go in Dennison in Tasmania?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well look, much as I love Ray Groom, and all the other former Coalition Premiers right around Australia. My feeling is that if you  want a new way you have got to have a new government. Not just a recycled Prime Minister and a recycled Premier and I just find

it really bizarre the way Labor is so focused on itself and so focused on celebrity candidates and not focussed on cost of living  pressures, not focused on job security and the kind of day to day problems that people want addressed.

LEON COMPTON:

And finally, before we leave you this morning. Last time you were in Tasmania you promised to honour the $100 million forest

package that is being rolled out at the moment. A listener wants to know if you will still hold to that even if the forest peace deal  isn’t signed off on?

TONY ABBOTT

What I said was that I was not going to begrudge hard pressed businesses the federal grant that they were recently given by Mr

Rudd. I also said that as far as I am concerned, Commonwealth money spent in Tasmania should be to keep industries going and  to boost industries not to close them down and this is the tragedy of the Tasmanian forest industry, it is potentially a great clean,

green industry, I mean it really is. It is the ultimate renewable, and yet for some reason the Labor/Green Government in Hobart,  the Labor/Green Government in Canberra, wants to close down the forestry industry. But those grants that were announced by

the Commonwealth a few weeks ago, they will be honoured.

Thanks very much.
