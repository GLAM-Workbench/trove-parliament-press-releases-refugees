Minister for Foreign Affairs, Alexander Downer

Abu Bakar Bashir, Papua New Guinea, Asylum Seekers

Downer: We don’t normally wish to set ourselves up as commentators about other  countries’ judicial processes.  But we do welcome the fact that Abu Bakar Bashir has been  convicted.  There’s no doubt about it - he, in our mind, is one of the key figures in  Jemmah Islamiyah, and as I’ve often said he’s the spiritual leader of Jemmah Islamiyah.  I  understand the court doesn’t necessarily agree with that, but that certainly remains our  understanding of Abu Bakar Bashir’s role.  So, we welcome the fact that he has been  convicted.  His conviction will obviously be subject to an appeal and we don’t want to say  anything that would prejudice that.  I think there will be some controversy though, about  the length of the sentence.  The sentence is a shorter sentence than we would have  expected.  Our expectation was that there would be sentence if he were convicted of ten  or twelve years, something in that vicinity.  But, nevertheless, having said that I think the  fact that he’s been convicted at all does send a message that the Indonesians are  becoming increasingly committed to dealing with the problem of terrorism and more  broadly, threats to the security of their state.  And there has been a significant change in  the way the Indonesians have addressed these issues, since the Bali bombing really, on  the 12th of October last year.  And we very much welcome that.  Sometimes the sentences  are shorter than we think they should be, but on the other hand, the fact that they’re  dealing with these problems in ways they never would have done before the 12th of  October is encouraging.

Journalist: Inaudible.

Downer: The verdict of course is that he has been convicted of the charges that were  brought against him, and we do regard that as acceptable.  I think that there’ll be some  debate, won’t there, about the length of the sentence.  Many will hold the view that the  sentence is a very short sentence, considering the role that Abu Bakar Bashir has played,  in our view, within Jemmah Islamiyah.  But in the light of the charges that have been  brought against him, and the charges that the court has found him guilty of, even bearing  that in mind, we think that sentence is a fairly short sentence.  Shorter than we would  have expected.

Journalist: Are there security concerns at all - that there might be a backlash?

Downer: It is still a conviction and it is a custodial sentence, and it is a relatively short  custodial sentence, bearing in mind the role that we think Abu Bakar Bashir has played as  the spiritual leader of Jemmah Islamiyah.  But we’ll just have to wait and see.  We have  included in our travel advisory the point that Australians should be very cautious that  there may be some backlash in Jakarta and more broadly in Indonesia, in the event of Abu  Bakar Bashir being convicted.

Journalist: Inaudible.

Downer: I think we gradually are.  I don’t think this is a war that will be won quickly.  But  I think in the context of what we’re talking about tonight, I think this is a small step  forward.  Abu Bakar Bashir will at least be out of the system, assuming the appeal is

unsuccessful, for some period of time.  I know it’s not very long.  And I think many would  feel it should be a great deal longer.  But in any case, having said that, he’ll be out of the  system for some period of time and that’s important.  Put that in the context of Hambali  being recently arrested.  Hambali was sort of really, the Chief Executive of Jemmah  Islamiyah, the co-ordinator with Al-Qaeda.  And when you take particularly somebody like  him out of the system, and that’s extremely helpful.  There’ve been something like 200  Jemmah Islamiyah people now arrested in Indonesia, some of them in the context of the  Bali bombing.  So we’re making progress.

Journalist: Inaudible.

Downer: Well I think they’ll feel the sentence is a very short sentence, in so far as they  feel Abu Bakar Bashir is responsible for the Bali bombing.  Now he didn’t physically carry  out the Bali bombing, but it’s our opinion that Abu Bakar Bashir is the spiritual leader of  Jemmah Islamiyah.  This was a point I made in a speech in Kuala Lumpur, two or three  weeks before the Bali bombings.  And so there is some contention about this, that it is  possible, and we think quite likely that he knew about the Bali bombing before it  occurred.  And in those circumstances I think the families will judge that this is an  extremely short sentence.

Journalist: Inaudible -  re terrorism hotline.

Downer: That doesn’t fall within the portfolio of the Department of Foreign Affairs and  Trade.

Journalist: Inaudible.

Downer: I’m just not aware of the issue I’m sorry.  You’ll have to ask the Attorney-General about that.

Journalist: Inaudible.

Downer: I think Sir Michael should understand that it’s in his best interest to sit down  with us and talk about our aid program.  I know that he’s gone to the media in Port  Moresby and had some aggressive things to say.  But the Prime Minister has sent a very  moderately worded letter to him about having another look at how our aid program is  working.  Bob Cotton went as the Prime Minister’s envoy to talk with Sir Michael and put  some broad outlines to him of how we want to change the aid program.  And I and the  Prime Minister have said to the Papua New Guinea Government, including to Sir Michael,  that I’m happy to go up there and talk to him.  But I think Papua New Guinea has to  understand that in this country we spend $300 million a year of Australian taxpayers’  money, of the people of Australia, supporting Papua New Guinea.  And it’s not an  unreasonable thing for the people of Australia, let alone the Government of Australia, to  be demanding that that money be well and wisely invested.  And we’re not sure that the  way we’ve been running our aid program over the last thirty or so years, has been as  effective as one would have hoped.  And we need to talk to the Papua New Guinea  Government about making that more effective.  Now, I would say to the Papua New  Guinea Government, that it’s in their best interest to sit down and talk to us sooner rather  than later about this.  And look, they will sit down and talk to us about it, but we will sit  waiting patiently until those political difficulties are sorted out.

Journalist: Inaudible.

Downer: At the end of the day, that was a democratic election.  He acknowledged that it  was a democratic election.  He may or may not have supported Greg Urwin, but in the end  I think he has the common sense to acknowledge the judgement of Pacific leaders, of his  fellow Pacific leaders, whatever way he may have voted.  We all vote in elections and have  times when we win and times when we lose and you just have to accept the outcome of  elections and work with the reality of what that election has produced.  So I’m not getting  into speculating on the minds of other leaders of other countries.  I’m just saying that we  put $300 million a year of the working people of Australia’s money into Papua New  Guinea, and Australians expect the Australian Government to make sure that their money  is properly spent, and has a desired effect.  And we want to sit down and talk with the  Papua New Guinea Government about how to make that aid more effective than it  currently is.  And if Sir Michael Somare feels a little uncomfortable about that, I’m sure as  time goes on that he will reach a greater degree of comfort in having those discussions.

Journalist: Inaudible.

Downer: I don’t think the Indonesian Generals are going to put $300 million into Papua  New Guinea.  I wouldn’t overstate it.  Sir Michael Somare has to make judgements about  his own behaviour.  That’s not a judgement for me to make.  Our position is perfectly  clear.  We want good value for our $300 million because that’s the money of working  Australians.  We want to make sure that that money is well spent and well invested and  gets good results for the people of Papua New Guinea.  That’s what we want.  Now we  want to sit down and talk with Sir Michael Somare about that, and if he doesn’t want to  talk to us next week about that, if he wants to put it off for a few weeks, well fair enough.   But in the end what we do with our money is a matter of great importance to the people of  Australia, regardless of what the Australian Government may (inaudible), it’s a matter of  great importance to the people of Australia.

Journalist: Inaudible

Downer: I think if people want to come to Australia, they should follow due process.  I  don’t think having a system where some people jump on a boat and try to come to  Australia illegally and circumvent all our rules and regulations and our visa system, and  others have to go and queue for visas and follow due process and Australian law - I don’t  think preference should be given to people who try to circumvent our laws.  And these  people tried to circumvent Australian laws.  There are perfectly clear processes they can  use to come to Australia.  We take refugees.  We have a refugee quota.  They can apply to  be part of that quota in the normal way.  They jumped on a boat in Indonesia and tried to  circumvent our laws altogether, and at the end of the day we are robust in sticking up for  Australian law.  And in this particular incidence though, where people were found to be  genuine refugees, we’ve helped to arrange for, that’s more the IOM and UNHCR, but we’ve  helped to arrange for them to be resettled in a number of countries.  And we always said  we would take some of them ourselves, and we have.
