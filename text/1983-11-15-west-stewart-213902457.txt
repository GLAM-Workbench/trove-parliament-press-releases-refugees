TALKS WITH GREEK UNDER SECRETARY

The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Mr Stewart  West, yesterday met with the Hon Assimakis Fotilas, UnderÂ­ secretary in the Greek Government responsible for Greeks abroad.

Mr Fotilas and his party arrived in Australia on Sunday for a  three week visit which includes meetings in Canberra,  Sydney,  Melbourne, Adelaide and Brisbane.

Mr West briefed Mr Fotilas and his delegation on the wide  range of initiatives taken by the Government for migrants  since winning office nine months ago.

The delegation was particularly interested in the steps taken  by the Government to eliminate discriminatory measures from  immigration and citizenship laws and policies, and in the  expansion of services to assist in the successful settlement  of migrants.

Mr Fotilas expressed warm support for the humanitarian principles  underlying the Government's revised immigration and refugee  policies, and for the action taken by the Government to promote  the development of a multicultural society. He particularly  applauded those measures taken which helped Australia's large  and long established Greek community to maintain its traditions  and share them with other Australians.

The delegation will also be having discussions with the Deputy  Prime Minister, Mr Bowen, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Hayden, and the Minister for Social Security, Senator Grimes,  while in Canberra.

"I welcome the warm relations and strengthened co-operation  between the Australian and Greek Governments, which was fully  reflected in yesterday's talks," Mr West said.
