Another Tony Abbott boat arrives

The Coalition’s continued refusal to support offshore processing legislation is a significant  factor in the increase of asylum seeker arrivals, the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship,  Chris Bowen MP, and Minister for Home Affairs, Jason Clare MP, said today.

Tony Abbott’s aggressive negativity continues to play into the hands of people smugglers,  with another asylum seeker boat intercepted overnight - the 48th since the Coalition  rejected the Government’s offer to implement offshore processing.

“The Coalition is trying to walk both sides of the street on this issue. On the one hand, they  deny the Government the ability to limit boat arrivals by blocking offshore processing  legislation. On the other, they attack the Government for the number of boat arrivals,” Mr  Bowen said.

“Boats will continue to come for as long as Mr Abbott and the Coalition put their own  political interest ahead of the national interest, so it’s time for them to put their negativity  aside and vote for offshore processing."

“We have a solution.  It is called offshore processing.  Tony Abbott is stopping it being  implemented,” Mr Clare said.

“If Tony Abbott is really concerned about people smugglers give us the power to put them  out of business.  No one will pay them $10,000 to be sent back to Malaysia.

“Tony Abbott knows this - he wants more boats to come because he thinks it will mean  more votes for him.  That is why he is stopping the Government from passing laws to put  people smugglers out of business.

“We can stop this now.  Tony Abbott just has to stop opposing laws that will put the people  smugglers out of business.”
