FAT J , IN MIGRATION PROGRAM EXPECTED

Responding to the Government's announcement tonight that the migration program for  1991-92 will be reduced by 15,000 places, Opposition spokesman for Immigration and  Ethnic Affairs, Mr Philip Ruddock said, "unless the Government was prepared to again  lower standards of entry it was inevitable that the program numbers would fall".

Application for immigration to Australia has dropped 10 to 20 per cent in all categories  in the past year. The Opposition has argued consistently that this is because people are  unwilling to come here when our economy holds out little prospect of improving in the  short term.

The projected outcome for 90-91 of 123,500 was only 2500 short of the planning level.  This is explained by the reduced standard of entry for concessional family and  independent applicants and a reduction in the backlog of outstanding applications in all  categories.

The three-year advance planning in the migration program is also inappropriate in the  current economic climate. The Labor Party's record in accurate economic forecasting  gives little hope that their predictions in this area will be any more accurate.

In relation to the special assistance category it is clear that this will enable the  Government to admit people assessed by it to be in special need. This is clearly to occur  at the expense of more than 6,000 other people who may have met existing refugee and  humanitarian criteria.

The Government also sees the Business Migration Program at risk. It projects a target  of 5,000 per annum even though over the same period employer nominations would  increase by over 60%

Mr Ruddock will be available for further comment on Wednesday May 1 1991. Please  contact him at Atrium Hotel Darwin, (089) 410 755 until 9.15 EST and thereafter on his  pager (02) 925 3911 #25589.
