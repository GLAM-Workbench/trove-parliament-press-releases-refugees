FISCHER AND TAMBLING VISIT CAMBODIAN REFUGEE CAMP

The Federal Leader of the National Party, Mr Tim Fischer, and  Shadow Minister for Northern Australia, Senator Grant Tambling,  visited the Cambodian refugee camp near Darwin River Dam  yesterday.

Utilising an interpreter, both Federal Coalition frontbenchers  asked the 79 Cambodians a wide range of questions, particularly  about preparations for the boat trip.

Speaking after the visit, Mr Fischer said conditions in the  temporary camp were very satisfactory and considerably better  than refugee camps near Cambodia.

Mr Fischer added that the officially-sanctioned visit had  convinced both Senator Tambling and himself that the case by case  refugee assessment recommended by Shadow Minister, Mr Phil  Ruddock, was absolutely correct. This approach was in accord with

long-standing policy.
