An RAAF Dakota aircraft would be flown into Laos

on Sunday to help relocate refugees from Vientiane to

Phonesavan (Plain of Jars), the Minister for Defence,

The aircraft had been made available following-a

request for assistance from the Laotian Government.

It was desired to move the refugees back to the

Plain of Jars at this time to enable them to begin crop

planting before the wet season began.

The aircraft, from the Transport Support Plight at

Butterworth, Malaysia, would conduct' a shuttle service between

Vientiane and Phonesavan and should carry between 500 and

700 refugees in about a week's operation.
