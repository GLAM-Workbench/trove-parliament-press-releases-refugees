ALAN JONES:

Tony Abbott, good morning.

TONY ABBOTT:

`Morning, Alan.

ALAN JONES:

Last week you were in front at the polls and it appeared as though you had the Prime  Minister on the rack. The Labor Party take decisive action in the certain knowledge  that the nation was about to elect you Prime Minister if things kept going as they  were. Now the polls suggest that you’re on the back foot. What do you tell your party  and what do you do?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think that new prime ministers always get a bit of a poll bounce but essentially this  is a political makeover, Alan, that’s what it is. Nothing has really changed except the  face at the top and the same problems are there. The same ministers are in the  Cabinet, including Peter Garrett. There’s a lame duck finance minister, the same  policies are in place and the same difficulties in terms of resolving any of them. So, I  think that we just have to stay on course. We’ve got good values. We’ve got good  positions on the important things. We will save the country from Labor’s great big  new tax on mining. We’re the only ones who can save the country from the great big  jobs destroying tax on mining that will damage everyone’s prosperity and that’s the  message that I’ll be prosecuting right through until polling day.

ALAN JONES:

I know politicians say that they don’t worry about polls but is it likely in this  environment that any poll would be accurate given the special circumstances that

apply in Queensland and Western Australia with the mining tax? What is your  feedback from those states?

TONY ABBOTT:

The feedback from those states, Alan, is that people are very, very worried about their  jobs, about their futures, because those states in particular are directly dependent upon  mining, but you see we’re all dependent on mining because the mining sector  provides about 50 per cent of our export income. That export income drives the whole  economy. Without that money we can’t pay our way in the world and that’s why the  fact that you may not have a mine in your suburb doesn’t mean that you don’t have a  mining industry or a mining based economy in your suburb and, again, that’s the  message that I’ll be prosecuting right through until polling day.

ALAN JONES:

58 per cent of those polled at the weekend felt that Julia Gillard would make a better  Prime Minister as opposed to 32 for you. How do you respond to that?

TONY ABBOTT:

I say look at the evidence. Now, Julia Gillard has been Deputy Prime Minister in a  bad Government. She’s been Acting Prime Minister for I think 20 per cent of the time  that that Government has been in office. So, she is equally responsible with Kevin  Rudd for the pink batts disaster. She masterminded the school halls rip-off. She was  there when $38 million was committed to tax payer-funded propaganda on the mining  tax and, look, sure she’s suspended the ads momentarily but she hasn’t pulled all that  revenue out of the Budget and she needs that revenue because just like Kevin Rudd  before her, Alan, she is addicted to spending and if you’re addicted to spending  inevitably, sooner or later you’re addicted to taxing as well.

ALAN JONES:

59 per cent of those polled said that any election should be delayed and 36 per cent  said an election should be called as soon as possible. Should we have an election as  soon as possible?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, we should have a government that’s sorts out the problems, that’s what we  should have and I think there’s a real risk that Julia Gillard and the powerbrokers  behind the Labor Party’s frontbench will push for a speedy election. They’ll try to  trick the public that a lot of things have changed, that everything’s different now and

go to a poll surfing that wave of good will that a new Prime Minister always gets but,  as I said Alan, the important thing is to fix the problems and one of the big problems  that emerged yesterday which no one seems to have noticed yet is that the  Government has a lame duck finance minister. I mean, I have a plan to get Labor’s  debt and deficit under control. They don’t even have a plan for a finance minister after  the election given that Lindsay Tanner is still in there as the finance minister and yet  he’s not going to be around after polling day.

ALAN JONES:

You’ve talked a lot, Christopher Pyne has talked a lot about education and you just  made some references to that a couple of minutes ago. I mean, we’re talking about  tiny tuckshops, as tiny as cubby houses, have been built at a cost of $600,000.  Catholic schools managed to spend I just said the same grants to build tuckshops ten  times the size. Toilet blocks that cost more than new houses are being built in New  South Wales public schools at an average cost of $586,000. If the NSW education  department had contracted its Building the Education Revolution for the same price as  Catholic schools, tax payers would have saved more than $1 billion, yet the polling at  the weekend showed that 56 per cent said that Julia Gillard had done a good job in  education. So, have you not prosecuted the case?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I think we were prosecuting a case against Kevin Rudd and now we’re  prosecuting a case against Julia Gillard but, in the end, it is the Government which is  the problem. It’s the Government which is to blame and I think that she will get the  blame in the future for the problems which Kevin Rudd rightly got the blame for in  the past and she is directly responsible for the school hall rip-off. She was the one  who for months, if not years, denied that there was a problem. She vilified the critics  and she’s done enormous damage and, you see, there’s $5.5 billion, Alan, which will  walk out the door in a month or so’s time to be wasted unless she changes the rules  and what should be done here is that the money should not be spent through the state  bureaucrats who are world champions at wasting it. The money should be spent  through the school P&Cs because they’ll get value for their money because they’ll  contract with local builders who’ve got kids at the school, who’ll give the school the  best possible value. Now, if Julia Gillard was serious about protecting tax payers and  surely that is the first duty of government, it’s not to waste the tax payers hard earned  dollar, she would suspend that last $5.5 billion, she would admit that it hasn’t been  done well up til now, she would accept personal responsibility for the problem and  she would make it different in the future. But I have the feeling that she’s not going to  have the magnanimity to do that.

ALAN JONES:

Let’s look at some of these other issues. The mining tax, there’s a headline today that  says that Julia Gillard is setting a deadline to end the tax war. Is she setting the  deadline or is the mining industry setting the deadline?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think that the Government certainly wants to have a face-saving something that they  can wave around and say ‘look we’ve made progress’ and I think there’s little doubt  that they could do a deal with a small section of the resources industry, the coal seam  gas…

ALAN JONES:

Yes, so to exclude that from the super profits tax and then delay any agreement on  other mineral sectors. Is that acceptable?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, no it certainly shouldn’t be because the coal seam gas people should never have  been included, like the quarries and the super phosphate miners and so on. They  should never have been included under this tax. Now…

ALAN JONES:

Wayne Swan’s going to be put in charge of this. He gets back from this G20 meeting  in Toronto. He’s the man that’s been saying, he’s in charge of the new negotiations,  he’s the man who was saying a week ago that the super tax, the 40 per cent, and the  retrospectivity were non-negotiable. How the hell’s he going to negotiate with  business?

TONY ABBOTT:

And he’s also been the one, Alan, who’s been calling the mining chiefs ignorant liars.  Now, this is the sorry path to which government in this country has come, that the  Treasurer of the Commonwealth, now the Deputy Prime Minister of the  Commonwealth, is accusing the heads of BHP and Rio of being ignorant liars and it’s  just no way to run a government or a country, it’s no way to run a negotiation and I’m  very doubtful as to whether any decent deal can be done because, in the end, the only  decent thing is to dump this tax because there’s already a profits based tax, it’s called  company tax. We already get a return on the non-renewable resources through  royalties. At the moment, our miners face tax rates which are comparable to countries  like America but under any increase in the tax rates, any overall increase in the tax  rates, they’ll be far less competitive and that means less investment, it means less jobs  and it means less prosperity for everyone.

ALAN JONES:

Do you think Australians understand that there was a budget brought down only a  couple of weeks ago and I tried to argue on that morning with Wayne Swan it was a  dishonest budget because the Government has predicated expenses in that budget on  money it doesn’t have, that is, $12 billion from the mining tax. I mean, do we need a  mini-Budget before we go to the election or do we wait for the Treasury report on the  state of the finances before the election is called?

TONY ABBOTT:

It’s a good question you pose, Alan. I mean, look, in the end, all we can say with any  certainty about this Budget is that we’re $57 billion in deficit now. On what we can  actually say with confidence, we’re $57 billion in deficit which is an absolute record  deficit. Now, sure, they’re projecting surpluses into the future but it’s all based on this

tax which they’re now saying they are negotiating on. So you’re right, it is a dishonest  Budget and I don’t think the miners will for a second be conned by any claim of good

faith negotiations until the Government pulls from the Budget the revenue projections  that the tax in its present form is supposed to garner.

ALAN JONES:

Alright. Now another issue, the boat people. Did Julia Gillard say when she was in  opposition that one boat arrival of illegal immigrants represented another policy  failure?

TONY ABBOTT:

Yes, it’s interesting. She used to put out press releases called ‘another boat, another  policy failure’ and I think she got to put out three a year when the Howard  Government was in place. These days, we’re getting three boats a week under her  government and, of course, the same strictures should apply. Look, the Rudd/Gillard  Government has completely failed when it comes to protecting our borders…

ALAN JONES:

So what would you do to protect the borders better than they have?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, essentially three things, Alan. Where possible, you’ve got to be prepared to turn  boats around, you’ve got to absolutely maintain rigorous offshore processing and I’d  certainly talk to other countries about doing some of it there and you’ve got to have  temporary visas so that the people smugglers are denied the product to sell - the great  prize of permanent residency in Australia.

ALAN JONES:

The G20s just met and confronted by massive waste and reckless spending by  European governments. Only Barack Obama is arguing that that spending should  continue. How do you get the Budget back into surplus without cutting spending and  where do you start these spending cuts?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, you’ve got to cut spending, Alan, that’s the only way and the countries that  don’t cut spending will eventually end up in the situation that we’ve seen develop in a  country like Greece. I mean, you’ve got to make sure that you live within your means

as households and you’ve got to make sure that you live within your means as  countries and too many countries for too long have been on this debt-fuelled spending  binge. Now, thanks to the Howard Government and the reforms of the Hawke/Keating  Government and the Howard/Costello Government, we weren’t in this position, but  the Rudd/Gillard Government is certainly spending us into unsustainable levels of  debt and the only way to fix it is to cut the government’s spending. Now, we’ve  outlined, Joe Hockey and Andrew Robb and I have outlined $47 billion worth of cuts.  I think they’re manageable. We’re not going to go ahead with the national broadband  network white elephant, we’re going to put the private back into Medibank Private,

we are going to cut significant money out of what we think is unnecessary federal  spending, we are going to trim, for instance, the public service by 12,000. It’ll still be  a little bigger than it was in 2007 but we don’t think it needs to be as big as its got  under Kevin Rudd. We’re not going to go ahead with the remaining computers in  schools programmes because at the rate Julia Gillard was rolling the computers out in  schools the kids would have left university before they finally got their computers in  schools. So, that’s the kind of spending that we are going to cut, and we think it’s  achievable, Alan, and we think it’s necessary.

ALAN JONES:

Pauline Hanson said to me yesterday that you would be her preferred Prime Minister  ahead of Julia Gillard. Do you regret that something you did all those years ago may  have resulted in Pauline Hanson being put in jail, which I said at the time and I say  again one of the greatest miscarriages of justice that we’d ever seen along with the  Lindy Chamberlain affair?

TONY ABBOTT:

Yeah, Alan, it was a miscarriage and the Queensland court eventually accepted that,  and it was magnanimous of Pauline Hanson to say that. We had a political argument a  long time ago and I’ve moved on and it’s great that she’s moved on.

ALAN JONES:

Do you regret, though, the fact that anything you did might have led to her being put  in jail?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, again, I had a political argument with her and if the circumstances were the  same I’d probably have the same political argument with her again, but look, she  should never, ever have gone to jail, never ever have gone to jail, and at the time I  thought that the Queensland prosecutors had gone right over the top and as the  Queensland courts eventually decided she was wrongly jailed and that’s always been  my position.

ALAN JONES:

It’s 7.30. I’ll just stay with Tony Abbott. Climate change is the other big issue. Julia  Gillard’s made noises about this, I suppose to get the Green preferences to come back  her way. Are we going to be hammered with this notion that the planet is warming  because of something human beings are doing? How certain is the science and should  government be acting in fairly draconian ways if the science is not certain?

TONY ABBOTT:

Alan, the science is not as certain as many people say. There are credible scientists  who don’t think that the UN climate change panel has got it entirely right. Now, we  should take prudent precautions against foreseeable threats and that’s why I’ve put an

emissions reductions fund front and centre of our environment policy and we will go  to the  market and we purchase abatements which will meet our five per cent  reductions target by 2020 but we’re not going to do it in ways which devastate the

economy, in fact the abatements that we purchase will achieve objective  improvements in the environment. We’ll get better soil carbon which will help our  farming, we’ll get more trees which will be good for the environment. So, this is the  prudent, achievable, careful way forward that the Coalition has outlined, quite  different from the emissions trading scheme, the great big new tax on everything as  Barnaby Joyce originally christened it, which the Government in its heart of hearts  still wants but it doesn’t have the guts to articulate it before the election.

ALAN JONES:

Just taking that point about the great big new tax, because Ken Henry, the Secretary  of Treasury, is saying in the last week that we don’t just need a super profits tax on  the mining industry but other industries should be taxed similarly. If you became  Prime Minister, would you be sacking this fellow Henry?

TONY ABBOTT:

Oh, look, he’s a very brilliant man and I think he is very, very knowledgeable, but in  the end it would be up to the government to make all these decisions. I mean, public  servants come up with all sorts of ideas, some good, some not so good and we think  these super profits taxes are very, very bad, very, very wrong. I mean, the idea,  Alan…

ALAN JONES:

But should an industry… I mean, I spoke to investment bankers in London when I  was there recently and they said that they couldn’t possibly in the current climate  recommend investment funds being directed into Australia. It’s virtually a capital  strike. I mean, should one industry in principle be taxed differently from any other?

TONY ABBOTT:

Of course not, of course not. Of course it shouldn’t. I mean, we should not penalise  success. We should rejoice in the success of the mining industry and we should  rejoice in the success of other industries when they are particularly successful. We  shouldn’t impose super profits taxes on success and we shouldn’t regard - this is  really important too, Alan - we shouldn’t regard any rate of return greater than you  could get putting your money in the bank as a super profit. That sends the most  appalling message to business, don’t go to the effort and trouble of employing people  and coming up with new products and negotiating all the approvals you need with  councils and state governments and federal governments to create a business, just  whack your money in the bank. That’s no message for a government to send but it’s  typical of Labor and Julia Gillard was there as the Deputy Prime Minister when all of  these dud decisions were made.

ALAN JONES:

Just before you go, election campaigns are knock ‘em down, drag ‘em out outfits and  in Australian history they’re between one bloke and another bloke. It’s now between a  bloke and a woman, and you’ve always got on pretty well with Julia Gillard. Firstly,  what did she say to you when you went and congratulated her on becoming the Prime  Minister?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, she made a curious statement, she said “game on”, and look, it’s not a game,  that’s the whole point.

ALAN JONES:

Is that gloves on or…? It’s not a game.

TONY ABBOTT:

It’s not a game, Alan. I mean, this is about the future of our country and we shouldn’t  be flippant or offhand about it. It’s very, very serious. Now, as you say, I’ve been  head to head with Julia Gillard in a lot of different contexts over a lot of years. I  respect her as an opponent, she is a formidable opponent, no doubt about that, but in  the end it’s the quality of people’s judgments, it’s the quality of their arguments, it’s  the assessment you make of their basic political and philosophical orientation, that’s  what the election will be decided upon.

ALAN JONES:

Ok, good to talk to you and I thank you for your time.

TONY ABBOTT:

Thank you so much, Alan.
