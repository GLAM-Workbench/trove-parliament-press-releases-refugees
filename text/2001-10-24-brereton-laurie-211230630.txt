Comprehensive Engagement: Labor's Plan For Foreign Policy Laurie Brereton - Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs

Media Statement - 24 October 2001

The Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs, Laurie Brereton, today released Labor's plan for the future direction of Australian foreign policy.

"This is a framework for comprehensive international engagement", Mr Brereton said.

"Labor's plan takes a long view of Australia's strategic circumstances and our primary international interests."

"It reaffirms key themes in Labor's foreign policy approach, especially our commitment to Asian engagement. Labor is unapologetically committed to Australia's long-term engagement with our region."

"Labor's primary foreign policy goal is to protect and enhance Australia's national security."

"Recognising the grave challenges posed by the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the threat of mass terrorism, Labor will energetically pursue non-proliferation and counter-terrorism strategies."

"Labor will give high priority to building regional and international cooperation to combat people smuggling.

"Our foreign policy also reflects Labor's strong internationalist tradition in areas including protecting the global environment and advancing human rights."

"Labor is determined to re-energise Australia's foreign relations effort and pursue our interests with determination at all levels of the international system - globally, regionally and bilaterally."

Labor's expenditure commitments in the foreign affairs portfolio announced previously and today total $85 million over 4 years.

LABOR’S PLAN FOR FOREIGN POLICY



COMPREHENSIVE ENGAGEMENT

Securing Australia’s Place in the World

At  the  beginning  of  the  21st  Century,  a  creative,  forward-looking  and  appropriately  resourced foreign policy is vital to Australia.  It is vital for economic growth, for jobs and  for Australia’s national security.

Australia must be prepared to energetically defend our national interests, to anticipate  and move quickly to seize new opportunities.

Labor has a proud track record of activism and achievement in international affairs.

Labor will restore international respect for Australia as a tolerant and outward looking  society, wholeheartedly committed to international engagement.

A Labor Government will give priority to Australia’s engagement with Asia.  While this  will not be an exclusive focus, Labor is unapologetically committed to Australia’s long-term engagement with our region.

Labor’s  primary  foreign  policy  goal  is  to  protect  and  enhance  Australia’s  national  security.

Recognising the grave challenges to security posed by the proliferation of weapons of  mass  destruction  and  the  threat  of  mass  terrorism,  Labor  will  energetically  pursue   counter-proliferation and counter-terrorism strategies.

Labor  will  also  give  high  priority  to  building  regional  and  international  cooperation  to   combat people smuggling.

Labor’s diplomacy will be both effective and principled.  A Labor Government will make  the advancement of human rights a core foreign policy objective.

Labor  is  confident  that  with  clarity  of  vision,  effective  advocacy  and  appropriately  targeted  diplomacy,  Australia  can  play  a  significant  role  in  regional  and  global  developments  in  favour  of  our  national  security,  our  economic  interests  and  the  common good.

Labor  will  re-energise  Australia’s  foreign  relations  effort  and  pursue  our  interests  with   determination  at  all  levels  of  the  international  system -  globally,  regionally  and  bilaterally.

Foreign policy retrenchment under John Howard

Ambition  and  imagination  have  been  notably  absent  from  the  Howard  Government’s   approach to international affairs.

Our  times  demand  clear  thinking,  creative  diplomacy  and,  above  all,  a  genuine  commitment to engage with the world beyond Australia’s shores.  Instead, the Howard









2



Government  has  often  been  muddled  and  backward  in  its  thinking.   Diplomatic  retrenchment has been the dominant trend.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Australia’s  international  standing  has  been  damaged  by  John  Howard’s  preparedness to treat foreign policy as a postscript to domestic politics.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The  Howard  Government has pulled back from wholehearted engagement with  Asia.  Australia’s regional influence has declined.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Australia’s relations with our nearest Asian neighbour, Indonesia, have sunk to a  historic low with serious negative consequences for our national interests.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Australia’s involvement in the United Nations and other multilateral fora has been  scaled down.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Human  rights  issues  have  been  pushed  to  the  margins  of  Australia’s  foreign   relations.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Australia’s  overseas  aid  programs  have  been  reduced  to  a  historic  low  as  a   proportion of our gross national product.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has suffered large staff reductions  and is less able to effectively advance Australia’s national interests.

Engagement in the Asia Pacific and Beyond

Australia’s  engagement  with  Asia  must  always  be  at  the  forefront  of  our  diplomacy.    Australia  is  inextricably  linked  with  Asia.   We  contribute  to  both  the  prosperity  and   security of Asia, just as the region profoundly contributes to Australia’s prosperity and  security.

Australia’s  greatest  long-term  challenges  and  opportunities  arise  from  rapid  economic   change in East Asia and the evolving security environment of the Asia Pacific region.

A  Labor  Government  will  re-energise  Australia’s  engagement  with  Asia,  including   working  through  the  Asia  Pacific  Economic  Cooperation  (APEC)  forum  and  other  cooperative  arrangements  to  produce  concrete  benefits  in  terms  of  economic  growth,   jobs and our standard of living.

APEC is the one regional body that includes countries on both sides of the Pacific.  Its  success  is  vital  to  prevent  the  formation  of  damaging  trade  blocs  that  would  threaten   Australia’s interests.  APEC continues to hold great potential as the forum for fostering  economic and political cooperation across the Asia-Pacific region.

Labor  is  similarly  committed  to  actively  support  the  ASEAN  Regional  Security  Forum   (ARF)  to  promote  region  wide  security  cooperation,  specifically  the  development  of   confidence building measures, mechanisms and practices of preventive diplomacy and  dispute resolution, and cooperation in respect of transnational security issues including  terrorism, arms trafficking, piracy and people smuggling.

Labor  is  determined  to  broaden  and  deepen  our  links  at  all  levels  in  the Asia Pacific  region  and  will  seek  to  secure  Australian  participation  or  association  with  new  and   emerging regional forums and processes.  We are determined to work with imagination  to enhance our regional influence.

Labor will actively pursue wider regional dialogue and cooperation concerning problems  of sustainable economic and social development, and environmental protection, with the  aim of enhancing human security throughout our region.

At the bilateral level, Labor will work with vigour to build productive relationships which  advance  shared  political  and  economic  interests.  Labor  strongly  supports  enhancing   people  to  people  contacts  between  Australia  and  our  East  Asian  neighbours  and  will   pursue the further development of social, cultural and educational ties.

Labor  strongly  supports  engaging  and  integrating  China  within  the  emerging  Asia  Pacific  security  community.  The  rise  of  China  will  inevitably  transform  our  region.   Australia’s interests are best served by China’s positive involvement in the international  political and economic community.  A Labor Government will seek to work cooperatively  with China, bilaterally, regionally, and in global forums.

Australia  and  Japan  have  a  long-standing  and  mature  relationship.  Japan  is  a  vital   economic partner  and  our  political  and  strategic  relationship  is  of  fundamental  importance  to  Australia’s  regional  and  international  aspirations.  Labor  looks  to  the   further development of Australian-Japanese ties, especially people to people contacts in  order to further greater understanding of each other’s society and culture.

Indonesia,  the  world’s  fourth  most  populous  country  and  Australia’s  nearest  Asian  neighbour, is of vital importance.  Australia and Indonesia have strong, shared interests  in  regional  security  and  economic  cooperation,  and  in  relation  to  many  diverse  international issues.

Indonesia’s  democracy  deserves  Australia’s  strongest  possible  support.   A  Labor  Government  will  move  quickly  to  build  a  new  relationship  with  the  new  Indonesia  - a  broad-based  dialogue  built  on  contacts  at  all  levels.   Labor  looks  forward  to  the  development  of  a  close,  mature  and  multi-dimensional  relationship  in  which  no  one   dimension dominates.

Within 10 days of the formation of a Labor Government, the new Foreign Minister and  other  Ministers  will  travel  to  Jakarta  for  discussions  with  the  Indonesian  Government.    This will be necessary preparation for a visit to Jakarta by the new Prime Minister very  early in the life of a new Government.

A  Labor  Government  will  promote  the  development  of  a  broad-based  Leadership  Dialogue between Indonesian and Australian political and civic leaders.

A  Labor  Government  will  provide  more  substantial  assistance  to  Indonesia’s  human   rights organisations and help Indonesia strengthen its legal institutions and the rule of  law.   Recognising  the  scale  of  Indonesia’s  economic  and  social  difficulties,  a  Labor  Government  will  encourage  the  International  Monetary  Fund  and  World  Bank  to  be   appropriately flexible in their approach to Indonesia’s international debt.

Labor will further develop our bilateral economic relationship with Indonesia, providing  humanitarian assistance, supporting sustainable development, and increasing people to  people  and  institutional  exchanges,  especially  in  fields  such  as  the  media,  education,   the arts, health and language training.

A  Labor  Government  will  seek  to  facilitate  the  development  of  a  positive  relationship   between  Indonesia  and  the  new  independent  East  Timor  and  more  broadly  to  build  a   new  framework  for  cooperative  relations  in  our  regional  neighbourhood,  possibly  through the establishment of a Council of the Arafura Sea, comprising Indonesia, East  Timor, Papua New Guinea and Australia.

Labor  looks  forward  to  East  Timor’s  formal  independence  and  participation  as  a  new   sovereign state in international and regional fora.

East Timor’s territorial integrity, democratic development and economic reconstruction  deserve strong and sustained international support.  A Labor Government will support  East  Timor’s  security  and  generously  assist  the  East  Timorese  people  as  they  build   their independent future.

Labor supports the further development of a wide range of institutional and people to  people ties between Australia and East Timor.

The  gas  and  petroleum  resources  of  the  Timor  Sea  have  the  potential  to  afford  East   Timor a much greater measure of economic self-reliance in place of aid dependency.  A  Labor Government will do everything we can to ensure the smooth implementation of  the  Timor  Sea  Agreement  and  the  fullest  possible  development  of  the  gas  and  petroleum  resources  of  the  Timor  Sea  to  the  benefit  of  East  Timor  and  the  Northern   Territory.

More broadly, a Labor Government will energetically pursue strengthened bilateral ties  with  Southeast  Asian  countries.   We  will  finalise  the  free  trade  agreement  currently   being  negotiated  between  Australia  and  Singapore.   This  agreement  should  enhance   the already strong relationship between our two countries.

Labor  will  pursue  a  free  trade  agreement  with  Thailand,  and  more  generally  seek   enhancement  of  our  bilateral  political,  economic  and  security  ties  with  this  key  South   East Asian country.

Labor is firmly committed to strengthening and broadening our links with other countries  and regions.

Australia must embrace India, a country of immense potential, an important participant  in global and regional forums, and a trading partner of growing significance.  Australia  has  long  neglected  India  in  our  foreign  relations.  A  Labor  Government  will  work  energetically to remedy this deficiency and enhance our political, economic and security  ties with the world’s second most populous nation.

The United States is Australia’s closest security ally and a vital global partner.  Labor is  firmly committed to maintaining and strengthening Australia’s close relationship with the  United  States,  a  relationship  founded  on  common  democratic  values  and  a  shared   commitment to international security and justice.

The  ANZUS  alliance  enables  Australia  and  the  United  States  to  contribute  to  each   other’s security in a low-cost, high-value way, and plays an important role in sustaining  the United States’ engagement in an inclusive Asia-Pacific security community.

Australia’s  alliance  with  the  United  States  does  not  involve  subordinating Australia’s  interests.   A  Labor  Government’s  approach  will  always  be  based  on  an  independent   view of Australia’s strategic circumstances and we will speak up to advance Australia’s  interests  and  perspectives,  while  always  recalling  the  overarching  importance  of  the   relationship.

Australia’s  utility  as  an  alliance  partner  is  enhanced  by  our  engagement  with  and   knowledge of the region in which we live.  A Labor Government will bring to the alliance  table  a  deep  knowledge  of  the  Asia-Pacific  region.   Labor’s  commitments  to  Asian   engagement and our alliance with the United States are self-reinforcing.

Labor  will  elevate  Australia’s  relationship  with  Europe  by  formalising  a  framework  agreement  on  trade  with  the  European  Union.   A  treaty-level  agreement  would  allow   Australia  to  pursue  a  broad  and  balanced  trade  and  investment  agenda  with  the  EU.    We also look forward to constructive engagement with the EU on global forums.

Labor will work to substantially expand Australia’s economic and political engagement  with the countries of Latin America.  We note the profound economic and democratic  transformations  they  have  undergone  and  the  scope  for  enhanced  relations  in  the   future.   A  Labor  Government  will  seek  to  further  upgrade  our  multilateral  cooperation  and our bilateral contacts, especially with Mexico, Chile, Argentina and Brazil.

Labor will give priority to the further development of Australia’s close relationship with  New  Zealand,  both  in  respect  of  bilateral  economic  and  political  ties  and  throug h  cooperation  in  multilateral  forums.  We  should  jointly  review  existing  mechanisms  for   cooperation for mutually beneficial outcomes.

Papua New Guinea is a country of great importance to Australia.  A Labor Government  will work closely with PNG in dealing with its very substantial challenges of economic  and social development in the context of great cultural and political diversity.  We will  continue to provide substantial support to PNG, focusing particularly on basic education,  health  services  including  programs  to  address  the  spread  of  HIV/AIDS,  district  and   community  level  employment  creation  and  income  generation,  and  improvement  of  resource management and conservation in the areas of fisheries and forestry.

A Labor Government will continue Australia’s strong support for the Bougainville peace  process.

Labor will pursue a genuine partnership with the countries of the South Pacific.

A Labor Government will:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ participate actively in and support the further development of the Pacific Islands  Forum as a strong regional organisation;









6



Ã¢ÂÂ¢ promote  economically  and  environmentally  sustainable  and  equitable  development;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ strengthen  regional  cooperation  in  areas  including  natural  disaster  planning,  response and relief, and fisheries research and protection;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ provide  appropriate  assistance  when  requested  to  enhance  democratic  institutions and processes in Pacific countries; and

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ work to ensure that the interests of the peoples and nations of the Pacific are fully  considered in the negotiation of solutions to global problems.

A  Labor  Government  will  continue  Australia’s  support  for  peace,  reconciliation  and   reconstruction in the Solomon Islands.

Labor remains concerned about the situation in Fiji.  While recent elections have been  judged  to  be  an  accurate  reflection  of  the  wishes  of  the  people,  this  outcome  is  not   reflected  in  the  composition  of  the  new  government.   Labor  will  continue  our  strong   support for an inclusive political settlement consistent with Fiji’s constitution and the rule  of law.

The negotiation of a just, enduring and comprehensive peace settlement between Israel  and the Palestinians is vital for security in the Middle East and for international security.

Labor  supports  the  establishment  and  maintenance  of  an  effective  ceasefire  between  Israel  and  the  Palestinians  and  urges  both  sides  to  resume  substantive  peace  negotiations.   Labor  supports  the  right  of  Israel  to  exist  in  peace  and  security  within   secure  and  recognised  borders.   At  the  same  time  Labor  supports  the  right  of  self-determination for the Palestinian people, including their right to their own independent  state.

Global Diplomacy: Support for the United Nations

Labor’s  approach  to  international  relations  is  based  on  a  clear  recognition  of  the   interdependence  of  the  world  community.  Global  economic  and  social  development,   human rights, environmental protection and international security can best be achieved  through effective multilateral diplomacy.

The  United  Nations  is  the  key  forum  for  cooperation  on  many  issues  that affect  Australia’s interests, including our national security, trade and sustainable development,  and our humanitarian concerns for people’s welfare and human rights.

Australia  must  be  wholeheartedly  engaged  with  the  UN  system  to  pursue  our  own   interests and help shape change for the common good.

A  Labor  Government  will  pursue  an  active  role  in  reforming  and  improving  the  effectiveness of the United Nations.  Labor supports reform of the UN Security Council.   An  enlarged  and  more  representative  Council  would  be  better  able  to  deal  with  the   security challenges of the new century.

Labor  supports  strengthening  the  UN’s  capacity  in  the  fields  of  preventive  diplomacy   and  peace  keeping.   Australia  must  be  prepared  to  accept  peace  keeping  responsibilities consistent with our national and international security interests.

Combating weapons proliferation and promoting disarmament

The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction -- nuclear, chemical and biological -- is  one of the most serious international security issues facing the world.  In recent years  progress in nuclear disarmament has faltered with adverse implications for efforts to halt  weapons proliferation.

Non-proliferation and disarmament are key Labor foreign policy priorities.  Australia has  a  direct  national  security  interest  in  ensuring  our  immediate  region  remains  free  of   weapons  of  mass  destruction  and  that  their  presence  does  not  lead  to  instability  and   conflict elsewhere.

A  Labor  Government  will  return  Australia  to  the  forefront  of  international  efforts  to   advance  non-proliferation  and  disarmament.   As  a  middle  power  with  considerable   expertise  in  non-proliferation  diplomacy,  Australia  can  contribute  a  great  deal  to  strengthening international security.

As  a  first  step,  Labor  will  commission  a  new  and  independent  assessment  of  non-proliferation  and  disarmament  strategies.   This  will  follow  up  the  work  of  the  1995   Canberra Commission on the Elimination of Nuclear Weapons.

This new international commission will undertake a comprehensive re-evaluation of the  threats  arising  from  nuclear,  chemical  and  biological  weapons  proliferation.   It  will  develop strategies for sustained international cooperation to address these challenges  and reduce existing nuclear arsenals.

This will be a major international initiative involving a wide-range of world experts.  It will  be  an  important  Australian  contribution  to  rebuild  momentum  for  multilateral  non-proliferation  and  disarmament  in  the  new  international  environment  following  the  11   September terrorist attacks in the United States.

The report of the commission should be produced in time to allow its presentation to the  United Nations and the international community in the second half of 2002.  Australia  would promote the report through active non-proliferation and disarmament diplomacy.

Cost:  Previously announced.  A new international commission on non-proliferation and  disarmament will cost $1 million in 2001-2002.

Labor  will  give  strong  support  to  the  Nuclear  Non-Proliferation  Treaty,  the  Comprehensive  Nuclear  Test  Ban  Treaty,  strengthening  International  Atomic  Energy  Agency  safeguards  against  further  nuclear  proliferation,  and  negotiating  a  convention   banning the production of fissile material for use in nuclear weapons.

A  Labor  Government  will  work  closely  with  like-minded  countries,  including  the  members  of  the  New  Agenda  Coalition,  to  rebuild  momentum  for  strengthening  non-proliferation regimes and eliminating weapons of mass destruction.









8



Labor  will  continue  our  support  for  regional  nuclear  weapon  free  zones  in  the  South   Pacific, Africa, Latin America and South-East Asia.  We will actively pursue linkage of  these zones to consolidate a Southern Hemisphere free of nuclear weapons.

Labor considers it important to support the integrity of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty  that  has  long  served  as  a  keystone  of  nuclear  arms  control.   We  have  expressed   concern  about  US  proposals  to  deploy  a  National  Missile  Defence  system  and  in  government we will advance efforts to reduce the risk of this defence program fuelling a  new nuclear arms race in the Asia-Pacific region.

Labor  will  reinforce  Australia’s  strong  support  for  the  Chemical  Weapons  Convention   and the Organisation for the Prevention of Chemical Weapons.  We will actively pursue  an  effective  compliance  protocol  for  the  Biological  Weapons  Convention.   Such  a   protocol would establish verification machinery and make it much harder for terrorists to  acquire these devastating weapons.

Labor  will  explore  opportunities  to  support  accelerated  chemical  and  biological  disarmament in Russia and other parts of the former Soviet Union and halt the transfer  of chemical and biological weapons technology and expertise to proliferators.  We will  also  explore  making  direct  contributions  to  securing  the  elimination  of  North  Korea's   ballistic missile and chemical and biological weapons capabilities.

Recognising the threat of ballistic missile proliferation, Labor will work to strengthen the  Missile  Technology  Control  Regime  and  pursue  more  effective  multilateral  constraints   on  ballistic  missiles.   Missile  proliferation  is  better  addressed  through  a  range  of  multilateral approaches than narrow reliance on unilateral defence measures.

Recognising  the  threat  to  security  in  the  Middle  East  posed  by weapons  of  mass   destruction,  a  Labor  Government  will  continue  support  for  United  Nations  efforts  to   achieve  the  verified  elimination  of  Iraq’s  nuclear,  chemical  and  biological  weapons  capabilities.

A Labor Government will support international efforts to develop and implement a more  focused  approach  than  the  present  broad  economic  sanctions  on  Iraq,  thereby  more   effectively  targeting  the  weapons  of  mass  destruction  programs  of  the  Iraqi  regime.    Effective  measures  that  constrain  Iraq’s  military  capabilities  are  essential,  as  is  the   alleviation of the burden of sanctions on the Iraqi people.

For  Australia  to  play  an  effective  role  in  combating  weapons  proliferation,  we  must   invest  additional  resources  to  retain  and  develop  the  intelligence  capabilities and  scientific expertise essential to support our non-proliferation diplomacy.

Labor  will  commit  additional  resources  to  enhance  national  intelligence  collection  and   assessment relating to the threat of terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass  destruction.  The details will not be disclosed on the grounds of national security.

Cost:  Previously announced.  Increased intelligence funding relating to non-proliferation  and counter-terrorism will be $7 million over 4 years.

Labor  will  also  commit  additional  resources  for  the  Australian  Safeguards  and  Non-Proliferation  Office  (ASNO),  a  specialist  organisation  within  Australia's  Department  of









9



Foreign  Affairs  and  Trade.   A  key  element  of  Australia’s  non-proliferation  strategy,   ASNO’s  responsibilities  have  grown  considerably  over  the  past  decade  but  has  not   been matched with sufficient resources.  Labor will remedy this.  Increased funding will  support  the  recruitment  and  retention  of  expert  staff  and  new  research  on  verification   technologies.

Cost:   Previously  announced.   Increased  funding  for  ASNO  will  be  $3  million  over  4   years.

Labor will strengthen Australia’s legislative prohibitions against activities relating to the  acquisition or development of nuclear, chemical, biological or radiological weapons.

A Labor Government will introduce amendments to the Weapons of Mass Destruction  (Prevention of Proliferation) Act 1994 to impose increased sentences of up to 25 years  imprisonment  for  persons  who  supply  materials  or  otherwise  assist  activities  they  believe  or  may  reasonably  suspect  relate  to  the  development  of  weapons  of  mass   destruction.

Labor will further enhance the powers of law enforcement agencies to search premises  and seize materials or things reasonably suspected to provide evidence of planning or  preparations to develop a weapon of mass destruction or otherwise commit an act of  mass destruction.

A Labor Government will pursue with Australian chemical and biotechnology industries  enhanced  physical  security  and  accounting  practices for  chemical  and  biological  materials which could be stolen or otherwise diverted for terrorist use.

A  Labor  Government  will  campaign  to  encourage  universal  adherence  to  the  Ottawa   Convention  that  prohibits  the  use  of  anti-personnel  landmines.   Labor  will  continue  to   give  high  priority  in  Australia’s  overseas  aid  programs  to  de-mining  activities  and   assistance to landmine victims in afflicted countries.

A  Labor  Government  will  work  to  further  strengthen  and  expand  prohibitions  on  inhumane weapons including new weapons such as advanced fuel-air explosives.

Labor strongly supports international efforts to address the proliferation and misuse of  small  arms  and  light  weapons  across  the  globe.   We  will  work  in  global  and  regional   forums  to  stop  illegal  trafficking  and  limit  destabilising  accumulations  and  transfers  of   small  arms.   A  Labor  Government  will  pursue  the  negotiation  of  a  new  international   protocol on illegal manufacturing of and trafficking in small arms.  Such an instrument  should  provide  a  valuable  international  law  enforcement  mechanism  for  crime  prevention and prosecution of traffickers.

International action to combat terrorism

Labor  condemns  all  acts  of  terrorism,  whatever  the  motivation  and  whomever  the   perpetrators.

The terrorist attacks on the United States on 11 September 2001 have fundamentally  changed the modern threat of terrorism.  Governments worldwide must respond to the  new reality of mass terrorism.









10





Labor  has  already  committed  itself  to  give  strong  support  to  the  international  intelligence,  law  enforcement  and  military  effort  against  those  who  committed  the  atrocities  in  New  York  and  Washington  and  those  who  support  and  harbour  them.    Labor will see this through in government.

The  deployment  of  Australian  military  forces  in  this  conflict  must  be  accompanied  by   clear thinking about the dangers involved, the potential international consequences of  sustained  military  action,  and  the  military  and  diplomatic  objectives  of  the  campaign.    Australia  must  always  exercise  our  own  independent  judgment  about  our  strategic  circumstances and ensure that our national interests are safeguarded.

The primary objective of the current campaign must be to eliminate the global terrorist  threat posed by Osama bin Laden and the Al Qaeda organisation based in Afghanistan.   This  must  involve  bringing  Osama  bin  Laden  and  other  Al  Qaeda  leaders  to  justice,   preventing  the  Al  Qaeda  organisation  from  posing  a  continuing  terrorist  threat,  and   ensuring that Afghanistan ceases to harbour and sustain terrorist organisations.

Military action directed to achieve these immediate objectives should be focussed and  conducted to minimise civilian casualties and damage to non-military infrastructure.

A  military  campaign  extending  beyond  Afghanistan  would  raise  very  difficult  strategic   and  diplomatic  issues.   Any  possible  military  action  against  targets  in  other  countries   which  support,  sponsor  or  harbour  international  terrorist  groups  would  need  to  be   considered  quite  separately,  be  based  on  compelling  evidence  and  command  wide   international support.

Beyond the immediate military task in Afghanistan, the international coalition must be  prepared to undertake responsibility for the reconstruction of that country and assisting  its reintegration as a responsible member of the international community.

Australia must be active in supporting the role of the United Nations in dealing with the  humanitarian,  security,  political  and  reconstruction  challenges  that  will  follow  the  dissolution  of  the  present  Taliban  regime.   It  is  likely  that  a  United  Nations  peacekeeping  force,  including  contingents  from  a  range  of  Muslim  countries,  will  be   required to provide the security necessary for long-term reconstruction.

Australia must also ensure that the campaign against international terrorism is matched  by renewed efforts to address the circumstances that help breed extremism.  We must  recognise the on-going danger posed by the situation in the Middle East and we must  do everything we can to ensure that the Middle East Peace Process is started again.

A Labor Government will work to strengthen international cooperation against terrorism  to  undercut  the  support  provided  by  some  national  governments  and  other  entities  to   terrorist  groups  and  activities.   Labor  will  pursue the  negotiation  of  a  new  Comprehensive  International  Convention  against  Terrorism.   This  will  be  a  major  diplomatic undertaking requiring intensive diplomacy and international coalition building.   At the same time, Labor will campaign actively to secure the signature and ratifications  of  as  many  nations  as  possible  to  the  twelve  international  conventions  dealing  with   various aspects of the global terrorist threat.









11



As part of this campaign, Labor will sign, or otherwise accede to, and ratify the 1991  Convention on the Marking of Plastic Explosives for the Purpose of Detection, the 1997  Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings, and the 1999 Convention for the  Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism.

Labor  will  support  the  imposition  of  UN  sanctions  against  countries  suspected  of  supporting, sponsoring or harbouring terrorist groups.

Combating people smuggling

A Labor Government will meet the challenge of people smuggling with a comprehensive  regional strategy.

Labor  will  pursue  the  issue  of  people  smuggling  with  the  highest  levels  of  the  Indonesian Government.  We will do so in the context of our wholehearted commitment  to build a new mutually beneficial relationship with the new Indonesia.

Labor  will  pursue  a  comprehensive  agreement with  Indonesia  to  extend  bilateral  cooperation  against  people  smuggling.   We  will  press  for  Indonesian  agreement  to   accept the return of vessels and people who are trying to use Indonesian territory as a  jumping off point to illegally enter Australia.  At the same time we must be prepared to  do much more to assist Indonesia deal with this national security, law enforcement and  humanitarian challenge.

Labor  will  provide  increased  technical  support  for  Indonesian  law  enforcement  authorities  to  disrupt  people-smuggling  operations  and  other  transnational  criminal  activity including drug and arms smuggling.  We will also provide additional assistance  to Indonesia in the area of maritime surveillance.  This will enhance the security of both  Indonesia  and  Australia.   Joint  action  by  Australia  and  Indonesia  to  crack  down  on   illegal  people  smuggling  and  other  transnational  criminal  activities  is  in  our  common   interest.

Cost:  Previously  announced.   Additional  technical  support  for  Indonesian  law  enforcement and maritime surveillance will be $10 million over 4 years.

Efforts  to  combat  people  smuggling  must  be  pursued  on  a  regional  basis.   Labor  will   appoint a Special Australian Representative to promote regional action against people  smugglers.  The appointment of a senior Australian official to this full-time role, together  with the establishment of an anti-people  smuggling  unit  within  the  Foreign  Affairs  and   Trade  portfolio,  will  provide  a  strong  focus  for  Australia’s  efforts  to  improve  regional   cooperation.

The Special Representative will explore the potential for convening a regional summit  focussed on the question of combating people smugglers.  A regional summit involving  heads of government, foreign ministers, and ministers responsible for immigration and  law  enforcement,  together  with  United  Nations  High  Commissioner  for  Refugees  (UNHCR),  other  UN  agencies  and  relevant  experts  would  provide  a  valuable  forum  to   develop a comprehensive framework for cooperation against people smugglers.

Indonesian support for such a conference would be very important.  Australia should be  prepared to fund such a conference and related meetings of technical experts in 2002-2003.

Cost:  Previously announced.  Funding for the Special Representative and the anti-people  smuggling unit will be $3.5 million over 4 years.  Funding for a Regional Summit on People  Smuggling will be $1 million in 2002-2003 (including preparatory work).

Labor will boost the capacity of Australia’s intelligence agencies to collect and assess  intelligence  relating  to  clandestine  people  smuggling  networks.   Labor  will  further  employ relevant agencies under the provisions of the Intelligence Services Act 2001 to  undertake operations which actively disrupt people smuggling networks.  Further details  will not be disclosed on the grounds of national security.

Cost:   Previously  announced.   Increased  intelligence  funding  to  combat  people  smuggling will be $5 million over 4 years.

Australia must put a greater effort into encouraging the international community  to  find   homes  for  those  people  in  Indonesia  who  have  been  assessed  by  the  UNHCR  to  be   genuine refugees.

Any long-term solution to the problems of people smuggling also depends, in part, on  assisting  other  countries  to  overcome  their  serious  economic  and  social  problems.    Labor  will  make  targeted  aid  contributions  and  settlement  support  to  countries  of  first   asylum.   This  will  help  reduce  the  number  of  people  who  illegally  make  their  way  to   Australia.

A  Labor  Government  will  also  further  increase  Australia’s  contributions  to  assist  the   UNHCR in Indonesia process Afghani, Iraqi and other refugee claims in transit countries  such as Indonesia and Pakistan.

Cost:  Previously  announced.   Increased  support  for  UNHCR  refugee  processing  in   Indonesia will be $11 million.

Promoting Human Rights

Labor  considers  the  promotion  of  universal  human  rights  to  be  a  core  foreign  policy   objective.

Respect  for  human  rights  leads  to  benefits  in  higher  standards  of  international  behaviour  and  the  contributions  domestic  peace  and  stability  make  to  regional  and   international  security.   Effective  human  rights  diplomacy  supports  Australia’s  national   interests.

Labor  considers  human  rights  to  be  a  subject  of  legitimate  international  concern  and   rejects  attempts  to  portray  this  concern  as  interference  in  the  internal  affairs  of  other   states.

Labor’s  human  rights  diplomacy  will  not  involve  lecturing  or  haranguing.   It  will  involve   the  dignified  assertion  of  our  right  to  speak  openly,  always  politely,  but  firmly  if









13



necessary, in support of principles all nations must observe.  We expect and welcome  the prospect of international scrutiny of Australia’s domestic human rights record.

A Labor Government will work energetically to strengthen international mechanisms and   processes for monitoring human rights violations, especially those under the auspices of  the United Nations.

Labor  will  appoint  an  Ambassador  for  human  rights  with  responsibility  for  advancing   Australia’s  human  rights  objectives  at  the  UN  and  in  regional and bilateral dialogues.   The  Ambassador  will  promote  a  higher  Australian  profile  on  human  rights  issues  and   seek  to  build  alliances  with  like-minded  countries  committed  to  the  advancement  of   human rights.

Cost:  The cost of this appointment will be met from current portfolio resources.

A Labor Government will give priority to ratification of key human rights treaties.

Labor  is  firmly  committed  to  ratify  the  Statute  of  the  International  Criminal  Court.   The   Court is a very important institution in deterring potential perpetrators of crimes against  humanity.    A  Labor  Government  will  move  quickly  to  ratify  the  Statute  and  actively   encourage other countries to ratify and achieve the earliest possible entry into force.

Labor will sign the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of all forms of  Discrimination  against  Women  and  move  through  Australia’s  treaty-making  process   toward ratification as a matter of priority.

Labor will vigorously support international campaigns to end the sexual exploitation of  women and children; to end prohibitions on education and paid employment for women  and the denial of equal rights to women.  Labor will further review the range of other UN  protocols  relating  to  the  rights  of  women  and  children  with a  view  to  signature  and   ratification subject to the treaty-making process.

Labor  strongly  supports  the  development  of  bilateral  human  rights  dialogues  as  an   integral  element  of  Australia’s  relations  with  our  neighbours  in  the  Asia  Pacific  region   and  beyond.  These  should  supplement  but  not  replace  multilateral  monitoring  mechanisms  and  not  constrain  Australia’s  ability  to  speak  up  against  violations  of  human rights.

Cooperation  between  national  human  rights  institutions  is  an  important  foundation  for   regional understandings and arrangements to advance human rights in our region.

Labor  will  work  to  further  develop  the  Asia  Pacific  Forum  of  National  Human  Rights   Institutions.

Labor will also offer additional resources to Indonesia’s National Commission on Human  Rights (Komnas HAM) and Indonesian non-government human rights organisations that  face major new challenges and opportunities to advance human rights.

Cost:  Additional funding for Komnas HAM will be $1.5 million in 2002-2003.  Additional  funding for Indonesian NGOs will be $0.5 million in 2002-2003.

Labor remains deeply concerned about the human rights situation in Burma.  A Labor  Government  will  do  what  it  can  to  maintain  international  pressure  on  the  Burmese   Government to improve respect for human rights and democratic freedoms.

Labor notes that the Burmese Government has opened a dialogue with Daw Aung San  Suu Kyi and that a number of political prisoners have been released.  Australia should  seek  to  encourage  real  dialogue.   It  remains  to  be  seen,  however,  whether  these   developments  constitute  the  beginnings  of  substantive  political  change  and  improved   respect for human rights.

Recognising the close links between human rights abuses and unresolved political and  social conflict, Labor will establish a new Regional Centre for Human Rights Dialogue  and Conflict Resolution.

This independent institute will work in partnership with non-government organisations to  promote regional dialogue, cooperation and capacity building.  It will serve as a centre  of  excellence  in  applied  research  and  policy,  human  rights  education,  and  develop  a   role as a facilitator of conflict resolution.

Cost:   Funding  for  the  Regional  Centre  for  Human  Rights  Dialogue  and  Conflict  Resolution will be $4 million over 4 years.

Core  labour  standards  relate  to  fundamental  human  rights.   Labor  deplores  cuts  to   Australia’s  participation  in  the  International  Labour  Organisation  and  reaffirms  its  support  for  programs  designed  to  address  abuse  of  labour  rights  in  the  Asia Pacific  region.  Labor will strengthen Australia’s participation in and support for these activities  and give priority to international efforts to eradicate the exploitation of child labour.

A  Labor  Government  will  play  an  active  role  in  encouraging  Australian  companies  operating overseas to adopt public codes which commit them to observe international  human  rights  standards,  including  core  labour  standards,  and  ensure  that  their  operations do not directly or indirectly violate human rights, or impact unacceptably on  local communities and the environment.

Labor  will  adopt  a  strengthened  export  control  test  to  ensure  Australian  defence  equipment  is  not  used  by  foreign  governments  to  violate  human  rights.   Labor  will  not   permit the export of Australian defence equipment to countries where there is a clear  identifiable risk of the proposed export being used for the major suppression or violation  of human rights or fundamental freedoms of their own citizens.

Helping protect the environment

Labor considers the protection of the global environment a key diplomatic objective.

International environmental concerns have become ever more acute. Many of the most  serious  environmental  problems  and  their  consequences  extend  far  beyond  the  boundaries  of  nation  states.  Environmental  degradation  contributes  to  social  and  political conflict.  Protecting the environment supports Australia’s national interests and  security.









15



Middle  powers  such  as  Australia  can  and  give  leadership  on  these  issues.   A  Labor   Government will rebuild Australia’s reputation as a leader on international environmental  issues.

In  September  2002,  the  General  Assembly  of  the  United  Nations  will  meet  for  the   Johannesburg World Summit on Sustainable Development on the tenth anniversary of  the  Rio  Earth  Summit.  Under  Labor,  Australia  will  take  a  leadership  role  at  the  conference.

Labor  will  ratify  the  Kyoto  Protocol  to  the  United  Nations  Framework  Convention  on   Climate Change before the Johannesburg Summit.

Labor will also:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Actively  engage  with  other  countries  to  achieve  international  ratification  in  time   for the Johannesburg Summit;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Work with emerging economies such as India and China to see them commit to  the process in future commitment periods;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Actively engage to bring the United States back into the process; and

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Pursue reform of the United Nations Environment Program aimed at enhancing  the UNEP’s advocacy of global environmental concerns.

A  Labor  Government  will  give  priority  to  environment  cooperation  in  the  Asia  Pacific  region where  rapid  economic  growth  is  accompanied  by  increasing  environmental  pressures and damage.

Labor  supports  regional  cooperation  on  environmental  issues  through  APEC  and  in   cooperation with ASEAN.  We will seek to upgrade consultation with Japan, the United  States, Canada and New Zealand.  A Labor Government will further seek to establish  new  and  substantive  dialogues  with  major  developing  countries,  especially  China,  Indonesia and India.

Labor  will  work  to  enhance  the  role  of  the  Valdivia  Group  of  Temperate  Southern   Hemisphere Countries in giving voice to southern hemisphere interests in international  environment meetings.

Australia’s  Pacific  Island  neighbours  face  increasing  environmental  challenges  arising   from  global  warming,  population  growth  and  rapid  increases  in  exploitation  of  land,   forests  and  fisheries.  Support  for  the  South  Pacific  Regional  Environment  Program,   sustainable management of Pacific fisheries and other bilateral environment assistance  to  Pacific  Island  countries  will  be  key  elements  of  Australia’s  engagement  with  the   Pacific under Labor.

As a major Antarctic claimant state, Australia has a special responsibility to protect the  Antarctic’s near pristine environment.  Labor will work to further strengthen the Antarctic  Treaty  System  with  particular  emphasis  on  enhancing  environmental  protection.   A   Labor  Government  will  energetically  seek  to  combat  unsustainable,  illegal  and  unregulated fishing in the Southern Ocean.









16





Treaty Making Process

Labor  is  committed  to  ensuring  effective  parliamentary  and  public  scrutiny  of  international treaties prior to final treaty action by government.

Labor will continue arrangements for review of treaties including the Treaties Council,  the  Joint  Parliamentary  Standing  Committee  on  Treaties,  and  the  requirement  that   treaties  together  with  National  Interest  Analyses  be  tabled  in  the  Commonwealth  parliament for at least fifteen sitting days before final treaty action is taken.

Labor  is  committed  to  further  enhance  consultation  with  State  and  Territory  governments  and  increase  opportunities  for  public  and  parliamentary  scrutiny  prior  to   the  conclusion  of  treaty  negotiations.   We  will  review  the  merits  of  putting  the  Joint   Parliamentary Committee and other aspects of the treaty-making process on a statutory  basis.

Strengthening Australia’s Diplomatic and Intelligence Services

Australia’s diplomatic service is a national asset -- one that is critical to maximising our  international  influence  and  securing  outcomes  that  advance  the  interests  of  Australia  and Australians.

Australian  governments  must  be  provided  with  timely  and  high  quality  analysis  of  international  developments.   Similarly  our  overseas  representation  must  enable  us  to   pursue our objectives in a cost effective way and to exploit opportunities to enhance our  national security, economic and other interests.

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and our diplomatic posts overseas have  suffered  significant  cutbacks  that  impair  their  ability  to  pursue  our  national  interests.   Targeted  reinvestment  in  our  international  relations  effort  is  required  to  meet  the  challenges of the next two decades and beyond.

A Labor Government will commission a comprehensive review of the capacity and focus  of Australia’s overseas representation to ensure that our network of diplomatic posts is  resourced  and  structured  to  meet  the  challenges  of  the  increasingly  complex  international agenda and the growing needs of government, business and the Australian  people.

This  will  be  the  first  comprehensive  review  of  Australia’s  overseas  representation  for   more  than  fifteen  years.   It  will  provide  a  timely  assessment  of  Australia’s  diplomatic   resources and requirements at the beginning of the 21st century.

Cost:  $1 million in 2001-2002  has  been  allocated  to cover the costs of the review of  Australia’s overseas representation.

Recognising the potential for events far from Australia to have major and direct impacts  on  our  national  security  and  economic  interests,  a  Labor  Government  will  allocate   additional  resources  to  strengthen  Australia’s  diplomatic  presence  in  the  Middle  East   and South Asia.  This is necessary to enhance Australia’s independent assessments of









17



a wide range of issues including regional conflicts, weapons proliferation, refugee flows  and people smuggling.

Cost:   Previously  announced.   Additional  funding  for  a  strengthened  diplomatic  presence in the Middle East and South Asia will be $5 million over 4 years.

Labor will ensure Australia’s foreign intelligence agencies provide maximum support for  efforts  to  protect  and  enhance  our  national  interests  and  respond  effectively  to  challenges  including  the  proliferation  of  weapons  of  mass  destruction,  international  terrorism, and other transnational criminal threats.  (See policy on non-proliferation and  people smuggling.)

A Labor Government will review the operation of the Intelligence Services Act 2001 after  two  years  to  ensure  that  Australia’s  intelligence  agencies  are  able  to  perform  their   functions  effectively  while  remaining  subject  to effective  accountability  including  parliamentary scrutiny.

Helping Australians overseas

A  Labor  Government  will  ensure  that  high  priority  is  given  to  assisting  Australians  travelling or living overseas through effective and accessible consular services.

It is vital that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and Australian diplomatic and  consular posts provide accurate and timely advice to Australians overseas.

The  growing  demand  for  consular  services  and  the  consequent  resource  implications   for the Foreign Affairs and Trade portfolio will be a specific term of reference in Labor’s  review of Australia’s overseas representation.

Reduced passport fees for older Australians

The  Department  of  Foreign  Affairs  and  Trade  issues  or  renews  more  than  1  million   passports  each  year.   Holding  a  passport  is  not  an  elite  privilege  but  a  necessity  in  a   country  where  so  many  of  our  citizens  have  relatives,  connections  and  business  overseas.

At present a 32 visa page, ten year adult passport costs $136 for adults (up $26 from  $110 dollars in 1995).

Labor will halve the cost of a standard adult passport for Australians aged over 70 or  more years.  This will benefit older Australians who may only use their passport once or  twice to visit family or friends overseas.

Cost:  The cost of halving passport fees for Australians aged over 70 will be $9 million  over four years.

Humanitarian Responsibilities

Eliminating  the  disparities  between  the  world’s  rich  and  poor  is  one  of  the  critical  international challenges of our time.









18



Global poverty is a leading source of international insecurity with high levels of poverty  linked  to  political  and  economic  instability,  human  rights  abuse,  civil  conflict  and  war,   environmental  degradation,  uncontrolled  population  growth  and  mass  movements  of   refugees.

Labor considers that Australia’s overseas aid programs should be focused on a single,  clear  goal,  namely  to  assist  developing  countries  reduce  poverty  through  sustainable   economic  and  social  development.   This  objective  supports  Australia’s  long-term  security and economic interests.

A  focus  on  poverty  reduction  is  also  consistent  with  Labor’s  determination  to  employ   overseas  development  assistance  to  advance  respect  for  human  rights.   Advancing   human rights -- economic, social, cultural, civil and political rights -- must be integral to  Australia’s overseas aid.

A Labor Government will establish a human rights framework for Australia’s overseas  aid programs.  Labor will include human rights issues and respect for indigenous rights  and culture, in our development assistance policy dialogue with recipient countries.

Environmental protection and remediation will be given appropriate priority in Australia’s  aid programs.

Labor accepts the internationally agreed aid volume target of 0.7 per cent of GNP for  overseas development assistance.  A Labor government will seek to improve Australia’s  development assistance performance subject to budgetary circumstances.

A  Labor  Government  will  continue  the  primary  geographical focus of our development  assistance programs on East Asia and the South Pacific, while not precluding significant  development  assistance  activities  in  other  areas,  especially  South  Asia  and  Africa,  where many of the world’s poorest communities are located.

Recognising the scale of Indonesia’s humanitarian problems, a Labor Government will  increase  assistance  to  help  the  Indonesian  Government  and  non-government  organisations meet the needs of more than 1 million internally displaced people.

Cost:   Additional  assistance  for  internally  displaced  people  in  Indonesia  will  be  $4  million in 2002-2003.

In  addition  to  Australia’s  current  humanitarian  and  development  assistance  to  East  Timor, a Labor Government will make a further contribution to assist the reconstruction  of East Timor’s health and education sectors.

Cost:   Additional  assistance  for  East  Timor’s  health  and  education  sectors  will  be  $4   million in 2002-2003.

Labor will continue special development assistance programs of global significance.  As  part of Australia's support for peace in the Middle East, a Labor Government will provide  additional humanitarian assistance to the Palestinian Territories.

Cost:  Additional humanitarian assistance to the Palestinian Territories will be $2 million  in 2002-2003.









19





A Labor Government will initiate a major expansion of Australia’s microcredit programs  that  help  the  poor  help  themselves.   These  programs  help  people  at  the  grass-roots  level.   The  ability  to  procure  small  loans  and  deposit  savings  by poor entrepreneurs  helps build stronger small businesses and leads to greater participation by the poor in  economic  growth.   Higher  incomes  for  the  poor  result  in  increased  investment  in  education, nutrition and health leading to an improvement in the quality of life.

Microcredit projects can often target women.  Where women are the source of increased  household income, the standard of living for families often improves significantly.  This  can also help women's standing in the family and community.

Labor will establish dedicated microcredit funds for the South Pacific and East Timor.   These  funds  will  be  employed  to  help  provide  local  communities  with  new  economic   opportunities that maximise local employment and skills development.

Cost:   $10  million will  be  allocated  in  2002-2003  to  establish  the  South  Pacific  Microcredit Fund.  $5 million will be allocated in 2002-2003 to establish the East Timor  Microcredit Fund.

A Labor Government will continue Australia’s support for international efforts to limit the  spread  and  impact  of  the  global  HIV/AIDS  epidemic.   We  will  continue  to  support  HIV/AIDS programs in countries with which Australia has close contact, in particular, but  not limited to, Southeast Asia and the Pacific, and encourage reforms of international  trade arrangements to allow for the provision of appropriate therapeutic drugs at lowest  possible cost to developing countries.

Labor  considers  debt  relief  to  be  a  very  important  component  in  efforts  by  the  international community to alleviate poverty and support sustainable development.  The  burden of debt borne by many of the world’s poorest nations is a serious barrier to long-term development and social justice.

A Labor Government will support further international efforts to relieve the debt burden  of the world’s poorest nations including acceleration of the process of debt cancellation  under  the  existing  World  Bank  /  International  Monetary  Fund  Highly  Indebted  Poor   Countries  (HIPC)  Initiative.   Labor  strongly  supports  Australia's  contributions  to  the   HIPC  initiative  together  with  cancellation  of  bilateral  debts  owed  to  Australia  by  Nicaragua  and  Ethiopia.   Labor  in  government  will  be  prepared  to  enter  into  bilateral   dialogue  with  other  highly  indebted  poor  countries  on  the  potential  for  conditionally  cancelling the unrecoverable components of the debts those countries owe to Australia.

Labor is committed to work actively to ensure that the International Monetary Fund, the  World Bank and the Asian Development Bank are held accountable for their programs  by measuring their success in terms of poverty reduction, particularly their impact on the  poorest and most vulnerable groups in highly indebted poor countries.

Labor  strongly  supports  the  role  of  non-government  organisations  in  the  development  and  delivery  of  Australia’s  overseas  aid  program.   A  Labor  Government  will  further   enhance  the  role  of  Australian  and  international  non-government  organisations  as  channels  for  Australia’s  development  assistance,  subject  to  rigorous  standards  of  effectiveness and accountability.
