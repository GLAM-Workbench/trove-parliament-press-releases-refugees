HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE TO SOMALIA

Today I announce that the Australian Government is providing humanitarian assistance  to people in Somalia facing severe food insecurity due to conflict and drought.

The $17 million in assistance that we provided to Somalia in 2017 helped prevent  widespread famine. In 2018, six million people remain in need of humanitarian  assistance, including more than two million who are displaced - more than 1.3 million  are children.

The risk of famine persists due to widespread violence, displacement and consecutive  seasons of failed rains.

Australia is providing $5.5 million in emergency food, clean water and shelter to  vulnerable Somali communities. Our support will be delivered through the United  Nations and trusted humanitarian partners.

Australia’s humanitarian contribution will help affected communities improve their  agricultural practices and financial management so they can be more resilient in the  face of protracted drought.

The Australian Government remains committed to doing our part to help address  global humanitarian needs, particularly those arising from conflict and food insecurity.
