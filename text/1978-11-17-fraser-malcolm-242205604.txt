In 1975 Liberals won 19 seats in Victoria. 'In 1977 " v e  won 2JLÂ·__ Only once before. in-.ont.. history has the Liberal Party held as many Federal seats in this State.

This not have achieved

it without your help and the full support of Dick Banter  _;._ whp campaigned Jiard ...for the return; or the Government. X well remember Dick saying to m e on election night,  “people always worry about Victoria —  but in the end we

always pull through.M

;  W e  pull through because of the. strength and loyalty that.can .   be seen at this Council. He pull through because we are , Â·   a Party that cares for neoole. We null through because ;Â· . .  \ we are Committed to effective, fair and sensible government

for Australia and this state.

What a contrast this makes with the A.L,P. In Victoria, Labor is trying to assume a responsible pose; hoping to... ... fool the people of Victoria; hoping Victorians have ;  Â· . -  -   . .  forgotten tne old Victorian State Executive, whose members

are still active in the Labor Party today? hoping \

Â· .  Victorians will not see the dominance and extremism of  ’  the socialist left. But the A.l .f . dashes these hopes every  time it has a Party Conference,

At last week*s Victorian State Lar>or Conference, once again  the Labor Party showed that they have not changed. Once  again they showed that the only record they can run on is their1  T&coxd as.the 'Longest "standing State Opposition

in the Commonwealth.

Once again the A.b.-g.  dead hand of socialism. was committed to the  Some Labor members said they  ,only wanted to nationalise industry "where necessary".

But the left w ing—wa. sniir..haying any of that ~~ they . insisted that the commitment to nationalisation of ' the means of production, distribution and exchange remain  in its pristine form_=Lr-....the same, form that it had .  . .

in 1921. What a way to step into the future, ..

Once again the A.L.P. showed their reluctance to criticise  the Soviet Union. Last Saturday they rejected a motion  condemning the Soviet GovernmentVs persecution of those  in their country whn support human rights. ,  The successful  move to defeat that motion was led by itr. Bill Hartley. ;  He all remember Mr. Hartley don’t we * —  h e ’s the man who,

we are always being told* has lost his influence in the  A.L.P. But it was Mr. Bert Nolan, State Secretary of the  Seamen’s Union who convinced the A.L.P. to vote the way '   they did by saying that he preferred to believe what

Russian unionists had told him.

The evidence of those persecuted by the Soviet regime, .   the evidence of independent impartial observers, the  mountains of evidence of the suppression of civil rights  in the Soviet Union are disregarded. The Victorian Labor

Patty counts all this evidence as nothing — -  they would  rather believe the official line handed down by  the  Soviet GovernmentÂ» Labor’s belief in the benign nature

of ‘ttrer^ovÂ±?rt~mithorities has about the same degree of ,  accuracy and relevance as their socialist economic theories.

In just three years, the Labor Party brought the  Australian economy to its kneest provoking roaring  inflation, causing massive unemployment, stopping  investment dead in its tracks, and harming the weaker,  members of* the community. Labor constantly pursues

its disastrous dogma, condemned by the past ’ —  promising  only failure and despair for the future.

We have been getting on with the jobt confident in. the  capacities of the Australian people;,  committed to a  faith in our country; knowing that our policies are  working.__________________ _ ______

The Australian economy is back on its feet —  inflation  is down. Under Labor, inflation peaked at 19 percent —   at the moment it is running at about 8 percent and it5 s  coming down further. Interest rates are coming down.

.. ./3

A fortnight ago the trading banks reduced interest rates  on a wide range of loans by 1/2 percent, particularly  benefitting small businesses. Interest cuts benefit  all Australians.

In the housing area they will benefit home owners and  home buyers. For example, on a home loan of $25,000 being  repaid over 25 years, a 1 percent reduction in interest  rates means a saving in the order of $17 a m o n t h —  $5,000  over the period of the loan.

Lower inflation and lower interest rates are making our  industry competitive again. A  survey In September found  that the propdrtion'of companies reporting increased costs -  was the lowest since 1972.

Manufacturers are looking again to export markets. I know  that at least one major motor vehicle manufacturer is  rebuilding its export organisation. Another survey found  T h a t  during the September Quarter Australian exporters of

manufactured goods reported an increase of 5 percent in  export deliveries. This was the first reported upturn

Mining and oil exploration and development are rising  sharply. Two companies alone have committed themselves  to spending $1,000 million in Bass Strait and off  Western Australia, directly because of the Government's  realdstic energy and oil-pricing policy. .... .  .  .

Farmers are beginning their best year for a long time, -  hcr yr-xtrf-l at ion, good seasons and improved prices will  allow farmers at long last to buy new equipment and make  long deferred capital improvements, boosting country towns  -and Au&tra- lian—Indus trie s supplying the rural community.

These are all exciting and tangible signs of progress. — But— there are-groups prepared to undermine Australia's  progress in the pursuit of their own narrow self-interest.

— The community-  has just been subjected to another damaging Â·   and unnecessary strike by the T.W.U, over the last two  weeks: a wasteful strike causing great inconvenience .  to the- publio-anfl losses in business activity. A  selfish

strike, not called because of any principle, but because one  section of a union set its interests above those of the _community and -of-. . their fellow unionists. A  hypocritical strike which makes a mockery of the union’s professed

concern for the unemployed.

4

The community utterly rejects strikes of this nature and  the policies this Government has adopted have led to a  significant fall in industrial disputes.

In 1974 under Labor there were 6.3 million man days lost  due to strikes. Last year, this had fallen to 1.6 million  —  one quarter of the man days lost under Labor just  three years earlier.

An equal threat to our economic progress is that of  unreasonable and excessive wage rises. The Government is  committed to Australian employees receiving1  a fair return—   for their efforts and to participating fully in Australia’s

growth and development.

In present economic circumstances, Australia needs wage  restraint. Otherwise our recovery will be slowed and employment opportunities will suffer, We look to the ---- : --  -Arbitration Commission in the current six-monthly national  wage case to bring down a responsible decision. With restraint,  with the community working together, Australians economic — — 1 —

recovery will continue and strengthen.

JE note that the fundamental principles of this Government’ -s-  economic policies are increasingly being endorsed and  adopted overseas —  in the United States, Canada and even  by the British socialist government. These countries have

seen the dangers of accelerating inflation. They are  taking the only responsible course of action; the very  course which we have pursued for the past three years to  reduce the galloping inflation of the Labor years.

It.ia because of the progress we ..have made ..that, it has beea-  possible for us to take a number of new initiatives to  secure Australia’s future growth and development. In the true spirit of co-operative Federalism, showing a common---

commitment and a common purpose, the Commonwealth and the  Australian States are working together in many areas to .   realise Australia’s unrivalled future. —

Ten days ago the Commonwealth and all six State Premiers :   agreed that for the first time State authorities can, over  eight years, borrow $1,767 million overseas to develop such  essential facilities as railways, ports, power projects,  water supplies and pipelines: __

For Victoria this will mean expansion for the crucial  Loy Yang Power Project and a new world trade centre which _  will bring business ana capital to the State. ;

The private investment' Encouraged toy these projects  going hand in hand with the work of the Australian  Governments will help us to forge ahead with the  development and out country.

The 1980*s will not be a decade of despair as Mr. Hayden  has tried to label thenr: — It" will be a period of renewed  investment; a period of success for Australia and  Australians.

Our objectives for the 19SQ’s go far beyond economics. The Government has a clear and wide-ranging vision of where Australia is.going. — IL is a'"vision we will achieve. It is a vision which is based on the needs, the interests,

and the hopes of the Australian people.

Our vision is of an Australia of growth and development;  of prosperity and enlightenment; of stability and security;  of compassion and effective help-  for-th ose- in-nee d Â» It  rejects the sterile dogma of the Labor Party -- which

denies people their individuality, their personal hopes,  their aspirations, It-is-based-en-a-concern f o r people —   whatever their occupations, whatever their origins. We  are determined to provide effective help to the  handicapped, to sole p arents, to— pensioners T to-war ' veterans —  to all those in real need. '

such as the introduction of  wf pensions; a major expansion

We have made major social reforms,  family allowances;-the  in assistance to the handicapped and the Galbally Report, which  heralds a new deal for migrants. All of these have made an

enormous difference - to hundred s-Â·-o f

We will continue with our social reforms. We will build on the  foundation we have -laid— in the past tftruc~years~by working  together in a common cause as Australians. Through a unity of  purpose and faith in our future, all Australians will gain from  our achievements and uncrossing— pro sperity^— : ----  .

It is our commitment to Liberal ideals which is reversing the  disasters wrought on our economy by-  t- ht ee-year3-o f Labor rule. It is Our commitment to Liberal ideals which has brought  Victoria 23 years of effective, moderate and sensible government

Of course, all political parties have difficult patches in their  terms in office. What makes the Liberal Party different is that  we have always been able—to-  come .  through -thorn- united and  determined to win, determined to serve this State and our  nation to the best of our abilities.

The last twenty-three years have been enormously creative ones  for this State, They have been creative because Victoria has  been governed by Liberals, and under rMck Hamer a a Prptni f   Victoria has enjoyed effective and moderate government-

It is time that we ail got behind Dick and exerted ourselves  to the utmost to make sure that this message gets across to  the people about what the Liberal Government in Victoria has  meant and will mean to Victorians future. It means stability,

progress. It means a better life for the people of Victoria.

Hben the time comes I am certain that Victorians will choose  :  Litteralisaa, They will not turn the politics ijf~ttir5~Strerte -ever—   '  t o  the extremists of the Labor Party. They will not hand over,  this State to the socialist left - to the Hartleys and their

like - to the deadening dogma and dead iiSStT ------_

The eighties will be exciting years for all Australia.

Our country will achieve its potential through positive  government; through a balanced and realistic assessment of  Australia’s potential, unclouded by the~ftxstort-ien-a—of-— -— .   .Socialist dogma; by encouraging Australians to use their  'Ã¢ÂÂ individual initiative and enterprise; and by restoring

incentive for work and achievement. ------- ------- - Ã¢ÂÂ  —  ----

-In the weeks and months ahead we mus t  all work together to ;  see that they will be exciting for victorl-a-p by— seed ng.that Dick Hamer and the Victorian Liberal Government is returned  for another three years of sound government for Victoria.
