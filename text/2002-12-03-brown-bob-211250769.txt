ALP Policy Still Owes Much to Howard and Hanson

The ALP asylum seeker policy will still leave asylum seekers locked up as if they were criminals, Greens Senator Bob Brown said.

“Allowing Christmas Island to remain as an effective prison camp, excised from Australian law, is the same solution proffered by Pauline Hanson before John Howard took it up,” Senator Brown said.

“Moving the Pacific solution to an Indian Ocean solution is no good solution at all.

“Mandatory detention as core policy should go. Before its introduction in the 1980s there was nothing to suggest that asylum seekers would serially abscond.

“Australians needs a big hearted policy that breaks out of the mindset of seeing asylum seekers as criminals

“The ALP’s 3 month mandatory detention limit is welcome but the new policy remains punitive. It still owes far too much to John Howard and Pauline Hanson,” Senator Brown said.
