TRANSCRIPT OF THE LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION  THE HON JOHN HOWARD MP  RADIO 2UE WITH ALAN JONES

Topics: Yitzhak Rabin funeral; policy; drugs guide; Superannuation; Asian immigration

The world lost one o f its great peace makers at the weekend, Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli Prime  Minister gunned down by a Jewish fanatic who felt that Rabin had yielded too much to the  Palestinians. Paul Keating is going to the funeral. As I understand it, John Howard has been  refused permission to accompany him. And the death o f M r Rabin has pushed the phoney

election campaign from the front pages for the moment. The polls this morning show a swing  back to the Prime Minister and to Labor. ALP support allegedly rose 3.5 points to 48.5,  which is just 3 points short o f the Opposition's 51.5, the Coalition's approval rating dropped

3.5%. Pollsters are saying Labor could have won an election if it were held this year. They  believe the Government could make up the difference if it went into an election 4% down in  the opinion polls. M r Keating has also outrated M r Howard as the preferred Prime Minister  with 48% support up 3 points. According to this latest Morgan poll, M r Howard's approval  rating apparently has dropped 3 points to 41%. I don't know what you make o f all this, but I  thought we'd talk to John Howard.

John Howard, good morning.

H O W A RD :

Good morning Alan.

JO N E S:

M r Rabin. Did you seek permission from the Prime Minister to accompany him to the funeral?

H O W A RD :

Yes, I did, and I was told by his office that there was no seat available for me on the plane. I  then sought to speak to the Prime Minister himself and I was given what could only be  described as a complete run-around by his office. They refused to give me his number, and I  in fact took off to Canberra from Sydney because I knew that the plane was leaving, M r

Keating's plane was leaving Canberra to go to Perth to collect a 707 which has a capacity o f  60 or 70 to go to Tel Aviv at 7.30pm and his office finally rang my home at about 7.10pm and  I was then in the air and they took off in the knowledge that I was on the way to Canberra to  get on the flight if I was allowed. I can only conclude that the Prime Minister just didn't want  me there compared to the behaviour o f the British Prime Minister John Major who's being

accompanied to the funeral by Tony Blair and also Paddy Ashdowne, the Leader o f the Liberal  Democrats; and President Clinton o f course, M r Dole, the foremost Republican, Senator Dole  in the Senate and a very large bipartisan contingent from both sides o f Congress. The British

and the Americans are showing the Australian Government how these things are done. Events  o f this nature are above politics. It is a tragic international event, and what M r Keating has  done is an insult to the Jewish people o f Australia, because he has politicised what is an event  that is above politics.

JO N ES:

Now, when you sought to make contact with the Prime Minister you couldn't, and ....

H O W A RD :

I was just given the run-around. I rang his office and asked for his number and I was told that  somebody would ring me back and I mean, I was not invited o f course. I heard about it on the  news and I have very very close links with the Jewish community o f Australia. I've always  been a very staunch public defender o f the State o f Israel all o f my political career, and I  regard the thing as an awful tragic event. This man had given so much for peace and I wanted  to demonstrate my bipartisan expression o f outrage with the Prime Minister. It was an

occasion where the fact that I'm Liberal and he's Labor should have been put to one side and  the spontaneous proper thing would have been for him to have rung me and said, 'John, I'm  going to Israel tonight, can you get to Canberra?' But not him. That's what John Major and  President Clinton did, and that's what any decent national leader would do. W e are dealing  with a man who plays the political card on every occasion and I think the Australian public

should know how events like this are handled by the current Prime Minister o f this country.

JO N ES:

Can we extrapolate from that then some further conclusions in relation to this 'phoney' election  campaign? It does appear to  many out there that there are significant differences as on this  issue between the way John Howard thinks and the way Paul Keating thinks. And on so many  instances it does appear that we are being told, this is the worst government we've had in a  long time yet we are not going to change anything says John Howard.

H O W A RD :

Well, I'm not saying that. I'm going to  change a lot of things.

JO N ES:

On savings for example. Peter Costello made a speech last week.

2

HOWARD:

Well, you haven't heard the full story on our ....

JO N E S:

Can I just say something and ask you for a comment? I mean, wouldn't the first thing you'd  say, if you wanted to make really a significant policy initiative on savings, if you were to  say,  'Look, to encourage savings as opposed to expenditure, we will not be taxing the interest that  accrues on savings'.

H O W A RD :

Alan, that is one thing you would say. Can I repeat you haven't heard the full gamut o f what  the Liberal Party will be saying on savings yet? M ost o f the publicity on the statement on  Super last week focussed on those things where we said we weren't going to make changes  but Peter Costello said that we had quite a bit more to say and the very thing that you have  raised covers one o f the areas where we will have a lot more to say. So can I repeat again that  people should stay tuned as far as savings initiatives are concerned. You have not yet heard  the fUll gamut o f what the Coalition proposes in this area.

JO N E S:

Is there a reason why you're not telling the Australian electorate now?

H O W A RD :

We are doing what every Opposition does. I mean, what in effect we are being asked to do is  to make the policy speech six months before the launch o f the campaign. I mean, the tradition  o f the Australian politics is that you start the campaign with a policy speech and in that policy  speech you tell the Australian people in summary why they should vote for you. Now, that is

what we are doing. I find it quite extraordinary that I amongst all Opposition leaders since the  war in Australia is expected to make my policy speech four, five, six, seven, eight months in  advance o f the election.

JO N E S:

Okay. Last week - you're a Member o f Parliament who represents a constituency within N ew   South Wales. New South Wales was dominated last week by talk about drug taking. You  yourself are a father o f children o f that impressionable teenage, adolescent age. Yet there was,  a guide we learn about at the weekend called "Pleasure Principles" which is a consumers  guide.

I do apologise for the language, to both my listeners and to you because neither o f us actually  speaks like this, but the language is sub-titled: "Piss, Powders and Pleasure" and it describes  heroin as "very safe for recreational users" and it gives descriptions o f how to inject heroin and  steroids and to sniff amyl nitrate, and it is funded by no less than the Commonwealth

Department o f Health. Do you have a comment about that?

HOWARD:

Well, I saw that report. I mean, this is typical o f the sort o f thing that Carmen Lawrence  allows to go on. I mean, this kind o f thing is an insult to parents who are grappling with that  very very difficult interaction, the tension and interaction o f their children and drugs. It gives  an imprimatur. I want to make it very clear that I am not one o f those in the community who  believes that the solution to this problem is to legalise drug-taking. I do not believe it is. I  think that is populist nonsense and this idea that you cure this problem by patting it on the

head and saying, you know, it's not too bad after all, is a counsel o f defeatism and it's also just  bowing to a popular thing, and we will certainly pursue the fact that that is being funded. I  mean, this is typical o f the way in which some o f these departments have been, I think, white-  anted by people who take a very very permissive view. And we will certainly be pursuing that.

JON ES:

On the question o f business, which has historically been one o f your constituencies, last week they  would have suffered a little bit to know that the superannuation contributions will rise to 9 per cent  funded by business - Robert Hill today saying business must contribute to the costs o f higher  education. Aren't they already contributing?

HOW ARD:

I saw that interview and what he was - he wasn't saying they must. He would like them to  contribute more but business only contributes to something like that if there's some kind o f  incentive provided. The question o f compelling them to contribute - they do contribute  magnificently as well - already, but the idea o f having greater interaction between business and the  higher education sector is a feature o f - for higher education in the United States and in other parts  o f the world, but most particularly in the United States. I think the idea o f encouraging business for  its own benefit to put more resources into education is a very good thing.

JON ES:

M r Keating dragged up the anti-Asian immigration issue last week. Did you withstand that?

HOW ARD:

Well, I think he does himself more damage than he does me. The Asian community o f Australia  knows that I treat all Australians equally. They remember that it was the Liberal Party that  abolished the White Australia policy. It was Malcolm Fraser's Government, o f which I was a  member, that welcomed Indo-Chinese refugees into this country. It is an appalling piece o f - it's  complete dishonesty and a lie for the Prime Minister to say that I would send people back. I mean,  what - 1 haven't heard the Prime Minister make such an outrageous claim in years. He's actually  saying that I would repatriate Australians citizens to the country of their birth.

JONES:

Then if all o f this is untrue, aren't we surely ripe for a piece of legislation to be introduced into the  Parliament that somehow guarantees integrity in government? Shouldn't there be some  prosecution, some sanction, against politicians lying to an electorate which has no way o f eliciting

from those same politicians the tmth?

HOW ARD:

Perhaps I'm naive - you may say I am - but in the long run the ultimate sanction is the vote o f the  people. I mean, I'm not saying there's anything wrong with the concept o f truth in political  advertising legislation, but in the long run the only way ultimately that people get their just deserts  on this is that the people have their say.

JONES:

He said that the tax cuts were L-A-W law, which virtually won an election, and they're still not  L-A-W.

HOW ARD:

No, they're not.

JONES:

That's a lie.

HOW ARD:

But one hopes that the Australian people have not forgotten that at the time o f the next election and  one hopes that when the Prime Minister —

JONES:

When is that going to be?

HOW ARD:

I think in March.

JONES:

Have we got to go through all this stuff for another three or four months?

HOW ARD:

Well, there's one bloke who can bring that to an end. As far as I'm concerned I'd still be happy if he  called the election. I hope he comes back to Australia on Wednesday and calls it. I'd be very happy  to have an election before Christmas.

5

JONES:

That would have to then be the 16th rather than the 9th, wouldn't it?

HOW ARD:

Yes, it would be.

JONES:

Right in the middle o f Christmas shopping. That would be the last thing they'd want.

HOW ARD:

I think it would be great. I mean, he's probably now left it too late to call it because the 9th was  probably the last date that you could do it. I think the 16th would be too close and cause a lot o f  discomfort. But I simply say that to make the point that we are ready, but I suspect now that it will

be in March.

JONES:

OK. Good to talk to you. Thank you for your time.
