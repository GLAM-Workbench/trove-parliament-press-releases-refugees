COASTAL SURVEILLANCE IN NORTHERN TERRITORY AND WESTERN AUSTRAT.TA

(Statement by the Minister for Transport,  the Hon R.J. Hunt, MP)_

The Minister for Transport, Mr Ralph Hunt, today announced  that Ansett Transport Industries would take over responsibility for  certain coastal surveillance operations in the Northern Territory and  in the north of Western Australia.

"The specific tasks concerned are the littoral patrol between  Bigge Island and Milingimbi and the patrol in the Darwin approaches., Mr Hunt Said.

"Following an application from Northern Airlines my Department  has finalised arrangements for the assignment of the contracts to Ansett  Transport Industries, Mr Hunt continued. "Ansett has accepted the terms  and conditions of the contracts and the Commonwealth's obligations under  the contracts are unaffected.

"I should also stress that coastal surveillance operations

have not been affected in any way by the changeover, Mr Hunt continued.   "In fact, the level of surveillance was stepped up over the weekend  following the detection of a refugee vessel.

"These coastal surveillance contracts are administered by my  Department fully in accordance with normal contractual conditions and  requirements.

"These particular arrangements which have been finalised by my  Department took into account the Northern Territory Government's aim of

establishing a soundly based range of regular public transport and

contract services in the Northern Territory.

"The Northern Territory Minister advised me of the package of  services which the Government hoped to develop in the Territory and

indicated the importance of finalising these coastal surveillance

2 .

contracts with Ansett in securing their policy objective.

"Ansett Transport Industries will therefore take over  responsibility for providing these coastal surveillance operations

from today."
