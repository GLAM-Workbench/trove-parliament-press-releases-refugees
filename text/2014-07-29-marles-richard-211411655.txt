THE HON RICHARD MARLES MP  SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND BORDER  PROTECTION  MEMBER FOR CORIO



E&OE TRANSCRIPT  INTERVIEW with MARIUS BENSON - ABC NEWSRADIO  TUESDAY 29 JULY 2014

SUBJECT/S: Government’s handling of Sri Lankan Asylum Seekers;  Newspoll and Prime Minister’s handling of MH17.

JOURNALIST - MARIUS BENSON: Richard Marles you, Labor, have been in  support of the Government’s handling of asylum seekers except for the dealing  with them at sea, are you now in step with the Government again now that the  asylum seekers are in Australia?

RICHARD MARLES, SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND  BORDER PROTECTION: Well this is a Government who has just engaged in an  enormous backflip with these asylum seekers in Australia now, the reason they  are here is clearly because the Minister failed in his negotiations with India, but  we shouldn’t forget Marius that the Minister’s original objective was to return,  very likely refoule, a number of these asylum seekers to Sri Lanka and the High  Court has had to step in and in effect tell him he can’t do that. We’ve seen now  twice within the last month the High Court step in, in the way this Minister is  handling his portfolio and tell him what to do, and this is clearly a Minister who  has lost control of his portfolio and is now being told what to do by the High  Court.

BENSON: You’re critical of the circumstances which have led to the present  situation but given the present situation, that the people are being held in  Australia, they’re being dealt with in Australia, are you in agreement with that  treatment of the asylum seekers now?

MARLES: Well there is still no clarity about exactly what is occurring with the  asylum seekers here in Australia, there’s not really clarity about the role of the  Indian Officials which have access to them, the idea that Indian Officials would  come and see whether there are any of their own nationals amongst this group  is unremarkable and we have no problem with that and what we now need to  see is that this is dealt with in a calm and a sensible way and the fact that the  High Court has had to step in twice now, within the last few weeks to tell the  Minister what to do ought to be a matter of enormous embarrassment for him.

BENSON: Do you agree with the Minister though that these people should not  stay in Australia?

MARLES: There’s never been any question of these people getting a permanent  protection visa in Australia, there has only ever been a question about Scott  Morrison’s political scoreboard and he has lost.

BENSON: Is the Government right to say that India is not a country from which  you can flee in fear of persecution from a country from which you can be a  refugee?

MARLES: Well the circumstances of these asylum seekers needs to be  individually assessed and I heard the Minister in his comments yesterday  describing all of these people as economic refugees, there’s a real question  about whether in those statements the Minister has utterly pre-judged each of  these individuals’ personal cases.

BENSON: Richard Marles can I leave immigration there and go to another issue  which is an opinion poll a newspoll out today in The Australian which shows the  personal standing of the Prime Minister has improved by as dramatic a  registration as has been seen in a fortnight of polling in the history of polling  over a fortnightly period he’s up 12 points, the Government and Opposition party  figures unchanged, but the Prime Minister getting a big tick from the public for  his handling of MH17, do you think he deserves that big tick?

MARLES: Well the circumstances around the tragedy of MH17 are such that all  of us in Australian politics have worked together to do what has needed to be  done firstly in terms of seeing those victims be able to be returned to Australia  and we have supported the Prime Minister in every step that he has taken in  relation to that, from the very outset Bill Shorten has offered complete bipartisan  support for whatever actions the Government needed to take and that remains.  And we have no criticism with the Prime Minister in his handling of that matter,  in terms of the polls more broadly, we will be focussed on doing the job of the  Opposition in holding this Government to account in what has been the most  unfair budget this country has seen, and we will continue to do that without

looking at the polls and without looking at the day to day soap opera of that, it’s  just making sure that we do everything we can to protect Australians from what  is a deeply unfair budget.

BENSON: Richard Marles thank you very much

MARLES: It’s a pleasure Marius, thank you.
