Michael Keenan MP - Federal Member for  Stirling Doorstop Interview July 17, 2013

Topic/s: Safer Streets program/ Labor’s federal law enforcement budget cuts

Michael Keenan

I am pleased to be here on the Gold Coast today, at the request of local Member Steve Ciobo, who has asked me to  come and look at the Gold Coast Council’s facility here. I must say that it is a very impressive facility with extensive  coverage over the main nightlife precincts of the Gold Coast and beyond. I understand that the Council are interested in  expanding this system and Steve has also been briefing me today and is also constantly in my ear in Canberra telling me  about the specific law and order problems that the Gold Coast is experiencing. We are very keen to work out a way as a  Federal Government, if we do get a chance to form government, that we can help. One way that we can do that is we  have a program called Safer Streets that exists to fund local community crime prevention initiatives, such as the CCTV  network that we see here on the Gold Coast and Steve Ciobo has been talking to me today about where the federal  government might help to expand what is already a very impressive network.

Secondly we are looking at ways that we can use the weight and the heft of the federal government to make sure that the  federal government law enforcement agencies, which have been savaged under the Labor Party since they came to  office, are doing all they can to fight serious and organised crime. On the Gold Coast in particular that comes in the form  of bikie gangs. There is more that the federal government can do to help here. The Australian Crime Commission is the  most powerful law enforcement agency in the country. We want to make sure that they are focusing not on chasing  athletes, who are abusing steroids, we want to make sure that they are focusing on dealing with the most serious criminals within our community and they certainly have the powers to do that. Steve Ciobo has been talking to me very extensively  over a long period of time about the closure of the Australian Federal Police office here on the Gold Coast. Sadly this is  part of a series of savage budget cuts that the Labor Party has inflicted on the Australian Federal Police. We won’t be able  to reverse that damage overnight  but we are very keen to make sure that Commonwealth law enforcement agencies are  doing all they can around Australia and here on the Gold Coast to tackle serious and organised crime such as bikie  gangs.

Journalist

What exactly will you direct the ACC to do on the Gold Coast?

Michael Keenan

The Australian Crime Commission is Australia’s most powerful law enforcement agency. They have had their budget and  personnel cut by 40 per cent since the government changed in 2007 and clearly when you have had your budget cut by  that significant amount then that means that the contribution that they are making around the country to fighting serious  and organised crime is not what it could be. We are going to make sure that the agency has the powers and the resources  that it needs to do its job properly, as we are with all of the federal law enforcement agencies, such as the AFP.

Journalist

Are you able to say what powers and resources you will be throwing at the ACC?

Michael Keenan

One thing we are very keen to do is to make sure that the Commonwealth wealth confiscation and proceeds of crime laws  are as tough as possible to make sure that we can call criminals in and ask them what is the source of their ill-gotten  wealth. The federal authorities have a great opportunity to work with the Australian Tax Office and other federal agencies  to make sure that federal proceeds of crime laws, which are quite frankly just too weak at the moment, are available to call  criminals in and make sure that if they have made their money through criminal enterprise then that money will be  confiscated and we will then use that money to fund law enforcement and crime fighting projects around the country.

Journalist

What about in the way of resources? What resources will you throw at them?

Michael Keenan

We have a record of making sure that federal law enforcement authorities were properly funded. We massively expanded  the remit of the Australian Federal Police and we actually created the Australian Crime Commission. We are not going to  be able to undo the damage that Labor has done to federal law enforcement overnight but our record is such that we will  always make sure that federal resources flow to frontline services such as law enforcement agencies.

Journalist

Does the Gold Coast have a bikie problem?

Michael Keenan

Steve Ciobo has been talking to me about this very extensively. The Gold Coast is an area that relies very heavily on the  tourism industry and therefore any perceptions of crime are going to be very damaging to that. I am concerned about what  I have heard from Steve about the extent of the bikie problem and we want to make sure that the federal authorities are  doing all they can to make sure that the Gold Coast is safe and secure and that residents here feel safe and secure as  they go about their business.

Journalist

Are you concerned at all that perhaps an expansion of the CCTV network could be an invasion of privacy? Could it end up  like cities overseas, like London, where people are concerned that the CCTV is filming their every move?

Michael Keenan

No I am not remotely concerned about that. CCTV is in a public place and what would you be doing in a public place that  you would be so concerned about other people seeing. CCTV is an incredible, powerful tool for law enforcement  authorities. I know that it works very well here on the Gold Coast and that is why the Gold Coast council is interested in  expanding it. London of course is a great example of where CCTV has been incredibly effective in catching perpetrators of  terrorism. So London is actually a very good example of why CCTV is needed.

Journalist

Are you offering to chip in for more CCTV units here? Is that what you’re doing?

Michael Keenan

It is a competitive process and this is a fund that people will be able to apply for from all around the country. Steve has  been very active in telling me what the priorities are here on the Gold Coast and if we do get a chance to govern then  obviously the application from the Gold Coast will receive very serious consideration.

Journalist

So it is a fund as such nationally that areas can apply for?

Michael Keenan

It is a nationally based fund. It will be $50 million. It is going to be a competitive process. Local communities will need to  apply for the funds. I have been very keen to have a look what the priorities here on the Gold Coast are and I can assure  you that they will get a very fair hearing and of course Steve is a very strong advocate for the interests of the Gold Coast  in Canberra.

Journalist

Just on a separate topic the Transport Workers Union have called for tougher penalties for those who assault taxi drivers,  do you agree?

Michael Keenan

I am not aware of that and it sounds like that would be a state issue.

Journalist

In terms of your responsibilities as Opposition spokesperson for border security and border protection and Customs, do  you have any comments to make on the issue that we saw on Christmas Island last night with the sinking of an asylum  seeker boat?

Michael Keenan

This is another terrible tragedy that’s perpetrated by people smugglers who continue to take advantage of very vulnerable  people. Sadly this is becoming all too frequent and I would like to salute the courage of the men and women of Border  Protection Command who are doing what is an incredibly difficult job. We need to see an end to these tragedies and the  way we find an end to these tragedies is we close down people smuggling, which is exactly what we will do.

Journalist

Just on the AFP station, is that something we are aiming towards if the Coalition take government?

Michael Keenan

This is the result of savage Labor Party budget cuts to Commonwealth law enforcement and particularly to the AFP and  the ACC. We are going to inherit a very tough fiscal situation if we do get a chance to govern and we are not going to be  able to reverse the damage the Labor Party has done overnight but we will always prioritise frontline law and order  services and that is our record in office.

Journalist

So not at this stage?

Michael Keenan

I can’t give a specific commitment about that.
