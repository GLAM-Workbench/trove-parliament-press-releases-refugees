FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF IMMIGRATION

AND ETHNIC AFFAIRS

175/79 4 December 1979

"Press and wire service reports circulating this

morning claiming that quarantine arrangements are being

waived in respect of the people arriving in Darwin on the

Entalina are incorrect," a spokesman for the Department of

Immigration and Ethnic Affairs said this morning.

"All people entering Australia are subject to

the normal immigration and quarantine requirements as laid

down by the authorities involved. There is no question of

these requirements being waived on this occasion," he said.

"Immigration and quarantine officials have already

boarded the Entalina. The immigration officials will be

interviewing the ship's master, crew and the people on board

to establish the facts of the situation.
