AUSTRALIA IN ASIA

Address by Senator the Hon Gareth Evans QC, Minister for

\

Foreign Affairs and Trade of A?stralia to the Foreign

Correspondents Club of Thailand, Bangkok, 9 September 1992

Future generations will look back on the late 1980s and early  1990s as a crucial watershed in Australian history - a period  when we really set about, for the first time, seriously and

systematically redefining our identity so as to give

preeminence not to Australia's history, but to our geography.

In the last half century, if not before, there have been of

course many previous attempts by Australian governments of  various stripes and colours, and by business, academics and  other segments of the Australian community, to make connection  with our Asian neighbourhood, and to reduce that sense of

distance which has been part of the feeling on both sides for  so long.

There was, for example, the strong support given by the

Chifley Labor Government immediately after the Second World  War to the establishment of Indonesia's independence; the  role played by the Menzies Governments, and in particular

Foreign Ministers Spender and Casey, in the introduction of  the Colombo Plan and all the development assistance programs  which followed, and in the steady growth of diplomatic

relations with both old and newly emerging Asian nations; the  active pursuit of trade relations with Japan, so much so that  it became by 1970 our largest trading partner; the ending by  the early 1970s of the White Australia immigration policy;  and above all the huge role - itself of a watershed character

- played by the Whitlam Labor Government between 1972 and 1975  in recognising China, ending our entanglement in Vietnam, and

generally bringing a refreshing new spirit of independence to

the conduct of Australian foreign policy which has been by and

large maintained during the changes of government which

followed. / \Ã¢ÂÂ¢

Until quite recently, however, it has been difficult to argue

that any really fundamental change of national mindset was

going on. For most of the two hundred years since European

settlement in 1788 it was the case that Australia fought

against the reality of its own geography. We thought of

ourselves, and were thought of by just about everyone else, as

an Anglophonic and Anglophilic outpost tied by history,

language, demography, culture, economics and emotion to Europe  and North America. The foundations for change in those

perceptions were being laid in all the ways I have just

listed, and others as well - over the whole period since the

Second World War. But a recognisable new edifice - built upon

those foundations, and presenting a striking new face to the

world - has really only emerged over the last five years or

so.

I continue to think that the key conceptual breakthrough was

the Defence White Paper presented to Parliament in 1987 by the

then Defence Minister Kim Beazley. That spelt out for the

first time in our history a coherent policy of defence s..eli

reliance - essentially being able to look after ourselves in

all contingencies short of a major war, without need to rely

on our traditional "great and powerful friends". New

confidence in our defence capability engendered by the White

Paper and its implementation did, in an important sense,

liberate Australian foreign policy. Australian foreign

ministers became able to think more freely and more

systematically about how to protect and advance Australian

national interests, without needing to look quite so much at

how our initiatives and reactions would impact on crucial

alliance relationships.

3

Following hard on the heels of this development, international  events erupted in a way which gave us all a great deal to

think about, and which very much consolidated the emerging  sense that Australia had to find its basic destiny in its own  region. The collapse of Soviet communism and the end of the

Cold War forced a fundamental reassessment, in the Asia

Pacific as everywhere else, of security and strategic

realities. The case became compelling for thinking about

regional security relationships in a new way, with countries  corning to see that their future security was best guaranteed  by building multiple layers of interdependence between nations  - finding security with others rather than against them. The  Gulf crisis and a number of other regional conflicts have

forced us to focus, in a way that really nobody had done since

the foundation of the United Nations, on the role of

international organisations and collective security principles  in maintaining and securing peace.

On another front, international and domestic economic

recession, the agonising slowness of international trade

liberalisation negotiations, the ever increasing competition  on world markets for our traditional cornmodi ty exports, and  the recognition (to which we have been responding throughout  the 1980s) that we needed to restructure the whole Australian  economy to make us more competitive and outward looking, all

forced us to think much more pointedly than we had previously  done about the need to harness our economy much more clearly  to the dynamic growth in the region to our north. Not just

the Australian government, but the whole Australian business  community, started to focus as never before on trade and

investment with the region.

At the same time as all these events were reverberating, and  partly in response to them, there has been occurring within  Australia - largely the initiative of our new Prime Minister,  Paul Keating - a quite sharp and lively debate on the nature

of our national identity, and some of the symbols and

institutions which express it. The question has been posed as

4

to whether we really can be a truly independent Australian

nation and project ourselves as such, especially to our

neighbours - when we have the flag of another nation in the

corner of our own, and when under our Constitution our titul'j'r

1 Ã¢ÂÂ¢

Head of State lives half a world away and our working Head of

State - the Governor General - is merely her delegate. These

remnants of our colonial history of course do not inhibit in

any practical way our freedom of action, and it may be some

time yet before popular sentiment is firmly on the side of

change, but that the debate is occurring at all is a measure

of the feeling, which is so tangible in Australia now, that we

are today better defined as a nation by our geography than our

history.

If the last five years or so have been a watershed period in

our national evolution, where then have we got to? How strong

these days is Australia's Asian connection? How do we now

define it? What is its current content and its future?

Geography. It has to be acknowledged that geographically, in

any strict technical sense, Australia is not and cannot be

part of Asia: we are not in Asia, but alongside it. What we

are unequivocally part of is the Asia Pacific region - that

sweeping crescent of countries, with the ASEANs at their

centre, stretching up and around through North East Asia to

embrace eventually North America, and south-east through

Australia and New Zealand to embrace the Pacific Island

countries and perhaps eventually (though not in anyone's

thinking at the moment) South America. Australia has always

been conscious of itself as, geopolitically, a Pacific nation

with long-established and close relationships with the

Pacific island countries and across the ocean to the United

States and Canada. The big change of recent years, which the

present Government has done its best to encourage both within

Australia and the region, has been the acceptance of "As.i.a

Pacific" terminology as nowadays more appropriately

descriptive in fixing our bearings. It signals that, in

5

defining or place in the world, we now look north as much as

we ever did east and beyond.

I

Demography. Demographically, Aust~al~a remains overwhelmingly  more European than Asian, but it is important to appreciate

nonetheless how rapidly things are changing as a result of

non-European immigration over the last twenty years, and in  particular a generous refugee resettlement policy which has  involved us, for example, in being easily the highest per

capita recipient in the world of Inda-Chinese refugees. There  are now 600,000 Australians of Asian descent: that is 3.5 per  cent of the population, and the figure is expected to grow to

7 per cent in the next twenty years.

It is perhaps worth making the point in this context that Asia  itself is hardly homogeneous demographically and culturally.  In the great arc of countries from Japan to Afghanistan

where there was no word for "Asia" before the Europeans came,  and no "Asian" consciousness there are six or more major

different cultural traditions, great ethnic diversity and a  multitude of living languages. While we in Australia are

manifestly not an Asian people, we are more or less

equidistant, culturally and demographically, from all its

elements. The Indonesian Kompas newspaper correspondent,  Ratih Hardjono, recently described us, in a book of that name,  as the "White Tribe of Asia" : as such we are well poised to

have good and close relations with all the other Asian

"tribes".

Economics. Australia's most developed connection with Asia is  economic, and the story is worth telling in a little detail,

particularly the scale of recent increases in trade and

investment activity. At one level we have been doing business  with Asia for a very long time, taking advantage in Australia  of the natural fit between our raw materials and the need of

North East Asia as it industrialised: Japan has been our

biggest market since 1966 (and, as I have already noted, our

biggest overall trading partner since 1970). Moreover,

6

Australian technical specialists have long been active in the

region, and many scores of thousands of Asians have studied in

Australia.

/

We realised, however, by the early 1980s that we were

profoundly limiting the opportunity to link our economy more

comprehensively to the dynamic growth occurring in Asia by the

continued operation of inward-looking protectionist policies.  A massive program of structural reform over the last decade

has resulted in Australian companies being much more

internationally competitive, exporting much more and,

moreover, exporting much more at the sophisticated end of the

productive ~pectrum.

Australian export volumes have reached record levels, despite

subdued world trading conditions and depressed commodity

prices: in the Australian financial year ending June 1992 they

were 10 per cent above year-earlier levels and growing at just

on four times the world rate. The growth in our manufactured

export volumes in particular in both 1990 and 1991 was the

fastest of any OECD country.

The Asia Pacific region, particularly North Asia and South

East Asia, has been of central importance in this strong trade

record. Around 60 per cent of Australian merchandise exports

are sold to Asian economies, and North Asia and South East

Asia accounted for over 60 per cent of our total growth in

merchandise exports between 1981 and 1991: and eight markets

there are in our top twelve. Merchandise exports to South

East Asia now exceed those to either the US or the EC, a

marked change from the late 1970s when the EC share of our

exports was twice as large as that of South East Asia.

Of all sectors of our exports, perhaps the most pleasing

result has been in Elaborately Transformed Manufactures which  have grown the fastest of all our exports - over 300 per cent

between 1981 and 1991. Many of you doubtless still think of

Australia's principal exports as being of primary products and

7

minerals. You may thus be surprised to learn that in the last

financial year, exports of ETMs to the Asia Pacific region

overall reached almost $7.5 billion in 1991 compared to only

$5.1 billion for unprocessed primary products (excluding

minerals and fuel). The fas test growing major markets for

Australian manufactured goods are in North Asia, with exports

of both STMs and ETMs to those markets rising by more than 700

per cent between 1981 and 1991.

We have been exporting successfully in areas as diverse as

biotechnology, remote telecommunications, agricultural

technology, coal power generation, mining and minerals

exploitation, and ports and airport development. Overall,

Australian manufactured exports to the region have recently

been increasing at rates of around 30 per cent per annum.

There has also been a broadening in the range of Australian

imports from the region, with just on 40 per cent of our

imports now coming from East Asia. A decade ago, petroleum

dominated our imports from South East Asia. Since then, the

share of oil has halved to account for only around one-third

of our total imports from that region. Over the same period

we began importing a much wider range of manufactured goods

from South East Asia and these manufactures are now the

largest component of our imports.

sophisticated manufactured goods such

Imports of

more  and

transport equipment from North Asian economies such as Taiwan  and the Republic of Korea have also increased in recent years.

The Australian Government has been supporting these

developments in every way we can. At the level of trade

promotion, the Australian Trade Commission - or Austrade - now

has fully half its total overseas resources concentrated in

Asia. Among the newer offices opened have been AustradeÂ­

managed Consulates in the important Japanese regional centres  of Nagoya and Fukuoka, and new offices in Hanoi, Phnom Penh,

and Surabaya. Plans are also afoot to establish Consulates in

8

Sendai and Sapporo in Japan, and an Austrade office in

Vientiane.

To enhance further our understanding of the economic fort~~

which are shaping the region, the Australian Government has

established in my Department an East Asia Analytical Unit to

conduct a number of studies on Australia's relations with the

Asian economies. It recently published a major analysis of

trade and investment links with North East Asia (following up

the earlier widely acclaimed study by Professor Ross Garnaut),  and is presently embarked on a major companion study for South

East Asia. Other studies being carried out cover future

demand for grains in China, scenarios for change in the Korean

Peninsula to the year 2000, post-1997 economic integration in

South China, and North East Asian manufactures imports.

Diplomacy. Australia's trade diplomacy in recent years has

also been sharply focused on Asia, most visibly in our

initiation of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)

process in 1989, bringing together the then 12 (now 15) major

trading economies of the Asia Pacific region in a cooperative

exercise designed to improve mutual understanding of our

respective economic environments, lead over time to reduced

overhead and infrastructure costs, and in particular to

achieve a wider region-based momentum for trade

liberalisation. In the fourth Ministerial Meeting here in

Bangkok this week we will be hearing reports from ten working

groups on issues such as harmonisation and standardisation of

regulations, development of data bases and information flows,

and physical impediments to trade and investment; hopefully

we will also be reaching agreement on the establishment of a

permanent APEC secretariat; and we will also, I expect, be

giving new impetus to a major policy exercise on regional

trade liberalisation.

Regional efforts of this kind are of course supplemented by

trade diplomacy at the global and bilateral levels. Despite

all the obvious frustrations, we see the GATT and the current

9

Uruguay Round as still representing the most important

opportunity to provide a broad and comprehensive framework for  world trade, and to avoid the development of global tradeÂ­

diverting trade blocs. We remain;cdmmitted to the Round - and

in particular to our role as Chairman of the Cairns Group of

fair agricultural trading nations (which include four ASEAN

nations) because the potential benefits, if agreement is

reached, simply cannot be obtained through regional or

bilateral means alone.

We have also continued to pursue a complex bilateral trade

policy agenda. Significantly enhanced access for Australian

beef to the ROK, the introduction of food safety standards for

some grains and fruits in Japan based on international safety

standards, reduction of tariff rates applicable to Australian

confectionery entering Thailand, and the participation of

Australian firms in half a dozen trade exhibitions for

manufacturing industries in Singapore in the first half of

1992 are just some recent examples of effective bilateral

negotiation contacts.

If I may shift the focus from trade to more traditional

diplomacy, Australia in recent years has also been

concentrating a great deal of its diplomatic effort into the

Asian and Asia Pacific region. You will be well aware of the

role we played over the period 1989-91 building on a

sustained effort by my predecessor Bill Hayden - in initiating

and helping bring to fruition the UN Peace Plan for Cambodia,

which currently involves the UN' s biggest ever peacekeeping

operation. Fragile as it continues to be, it is generally

accepted that the implementation of this plan was the only way

of taking the international tension out of the region's most

intractable security problem, and at the same time giving the

Cambodian people a chance of respite after their appalling

experience since 1970 of war, civil war, genocide, invasion

and civil war again.

10

In addition to many individual exercises in bilateral bridgeÂ­ building (most notably with Indonesia), and in regional policy  development (eg with our Chemical Weapons Regional

Ini tiati?~', perhaps our most high profile role has been in  encouraging a new regional security dialogue process in

response to the uncertainties generated by the end of the Cold  War. At successive ASEAN PMC meetings we have been urging  debate on the meaning and relevance these days of concepts

like common security, collective security, deterrence and the  balance of power, and on ways of developing confidence in

enhancing cooperative strategies. We recognise, of course,  that progress is only likely to be achieved in practice by

gradual, incremental measures in which the confidence of each  relevant party is won and consolidated step by step along the  way but we are encouraged by the extent to which that

process has already evolved.

An important element in our diplomatic effort has been the

gradual rebalancing in resource allocation away from our

traditional focus on Europe towards a significantly greater  concentration of resources in Asia. In last month's

Australian Budget, for example, we announced the closure of  three European missions. That was accompanied at the same

time by the addition of ten senior staff at a cost of $Al.2

million per annum to Australian diplomatic missions  including Jakarta, Tokyo, Bangkok, Seoul and Kuala  the opening of a new Consulate-General under

management in Guangzhou, to take advantage

Lumpur;  Austrade  of the

extraordinary rapid growth in the South China region; and the  allocation of additional funds of $A4 .1 million over four

years to enable the Australian Commerce and Industry office in  Taipei to expand its resources to promote Australia's trade,  investment and other unofficial relations with Taiwan.

Culture. Effective engagement of the kind Australia is now  seeking with Asia cannot be pursued only at diplomatic and  business levels: it has to involve broad based people-toÂ­

people contact (of the kind that we are now generating through

11

huge increases in tourism and in the provision of educational,

services, as well as through our migration program), and it

has to involve efforts by countries to get inside - as it were

- each other's minds. We have certainly seen educational,

information and cultural programs as having an important role

to play in projecting a contemporary image of Australia in the

region and reducing stereotypes held about us, and at the same

time giving Australians a better understanding of the region

and our role in it.

With all this in mind, a number of well-resourced foundations

have been established to foster better mutual understanding -

currently covering China, Japan, the Republic of Korea,

Indonesia and India the last three of which have been

established in the last three years. The Government has also

assisted in the foundation of other bodies such as the Asia

Australia Institute whose purpose is to promote greater twoÂ­

way knowledge of Australia in the region. And we recently

established a Council for Australia Abroad to coordinate the

activities of all those agencies, government and semiÂ­

government, that are involved in external promotion of

Australia: one of the first fruits of this will be a major

exercise  cultural  package.

in Korea in November involving trade exhibitions,

events and seminars in a combined promotional

It is also worth noting that the Australian Government is

currently aiming, through its National Policy on Languages, to

increase the proportion of Australian students in their final

high school year studying a language other than English to 25

per cent nationally by the year 2000. In seeking to meet this

target, the Government has given special encouragement to the

development of national curriculum material in six Asian

languages of major importance to Australia, namely Thai,

Japanese, Mandarin, Korean, Vietnamese and Malay/Indonesian.

For all these efforts, it has to be acknowledged that the

forging and shaping of impressions that countries and peoples

12

have of each other is the product of generations of history,

and cannot be rapidly changed. But it is my own judgment that

there has been a very rapid evolution in recent years, at all

levels of Australian society, away from crude stereotypfn:~

towards a much more sensitive awareness and understanding o~

the complexity and significance of Asian societies, and a

similar movement - although slower to penetrate below the most

actively involved elites in Asian attitudes towards

Australia.

As we develop a closer, more engaged relationship with our

Asian neighbours there are bound to be particular issues which

cause bumps along the way. One obvious area of continuing,

sensitivity is likely to be human rights - and in particulai

political and civil rights - where Australia tends to have

strongly held views often seen as inappropriate elsewhere in

the region. But these issues can be handled in a productive

rather than destructive way.

On the part of our neighbours, it is a matter of appreciating

that we put forward views on these issues not because of

patronising Western arrogance, but because we sincerely

believe that values of universal application are involved,

inherent in the United Nations Charter, and that it is not

necessarily interference in internal affairs to be concerned

with the inviolability of human dignity. On Australia's part,

it is a matter of appreciating that most of our neighbours

strongly believe, and understandably, that economic and social  rights are at least as important as political and civil

rights, and of emphasising them accordingly; of recognising

that what matters is the result at the end of the day, not the

size of the drum that is beaten along the way; and in that

context, that b.Ol'.l something is said is as likely to determine

a response as much as liha:t is said. It is not a matter of

denying our tradition or our values to tread, on occasion, a

little more softly than one might with Europeans and North

Americans: it is just a matter of learning the business of

normal neighbourhood civility.

In my book written with Bruce Grant and published last year -Australia's Foreign Relations: in the World of the 1990s - I

described Australia as a middle ~oWer with an internationalist  outlook and a strong Asia Pacific orientation. Still the

twelfth biggest economy in the world, with a GDP roughly

equivalent to all six ASEANs combined, we are not an

insubstantial presence in this region. But equally we are

conscious that, with a population of just over 17 million in a  world of five-and-a-half billion and when our ASEAN

neighbours alone outnumber us twenty to one - we should not

get exaggerated notions of our capacity for influence.

Our outlook is one where we seek neither to dominate, nor to

allow ourselves to be dominated by, our regional neighbours.  We strongly believe that all of us in the region have much to

of fer each other by working closely and cooperatively

together. We want to engage with Asia in a clear-eyed spirit  of partnership, with strong mutual respect and strong mutual  understanding, working together secure a safe and prosperous  future for us all.

Thai Prime Minister Anand, in a very friendly speech just over  a week ago (2 September) to the Australian-Thai Business

Council, said to Australia this: "If you can make up your

mind as to who you are and where you belong and where you want  to be in the future, Asian countries like Thailand would

readily accept your decision." I can assure the Prime

Minister that we haY.e made up our mind, and that we know that  j:hi.s is the region - Asia and the Asia Pacific - where we in

Australia must make our future.
