FEDERAL GRANTS FOR AUSTRALIAN YOUTH ORGANISATIONS

Church youth groups,  Scouts and Guides,  youth health and housing  organisations, and ethnic youth groups will all benefit from a $1 .16  million Federal Government scheme, to support national youth  organisations during International Youth Year .

Funding for the 1985-86 Program of Assistance to Youth Organisations  (PAYO) was announced today by Mr John Dawkins,  Minister Assisting  the Prime Minister for Youth Affairs .

Mr Dawkins said the PAYO scheme was designed to help non-government  youth groups strengthen and develop their programs and services  for young people .

The 43 PAYO grants will be used by 33 different organisations,   including the Inventors Association of Australia and the IndoÂ­ Chinese Refugee Association (ICRA). ((Details over page))

Young inventors will be encouraged to develop and market original .   creations, through "ideas centres",  to be organised in conjunction  with several national youth organisations,  with the help of a  $30,000 grant to the Inventors Association .

Mr Dawkins said the $27,000 grant to the Indo-Chinese Refugee  Association would help mount the first national investigation of the  needs of Australia's young Indo-Chinese refugees .

Special provision has also been made in the PAYO grants for tackling  the problems of disadvantaged young people - with $120,000 earmarked  for programs aiding Aboriginal and disabled youth . t

"The'largest PAYO grant of $296,000 will go to the Youth Affairs  Council of Australia (YACA),  which is the national body representing  the interests of youth organisations, workers with youth,  and  young people," Mr Dawkins said.

"YACA has played a vital role,  in voicing the opinions of young  people and those who work with them, both during International Youth  Year,  and for many years before .

"This year the Government has increased overall PAYO funding by 21%  above 1984, because we realise the importance of the national nonÂ­ government youth sector,  particularly during International Youth  Year."

Mr Dawkins said voluntary youth groups had achieved major social  development in Australia,  and he was particularly keen to support  schemes which increased the participation of young people in  decision-making .

He said the variety of young people's needs and concerns was Â· reflected by the range of PAYO grants - from church,  ethnic and  community service activities, to public broadcasting,  wildlife and

adolescent health .
