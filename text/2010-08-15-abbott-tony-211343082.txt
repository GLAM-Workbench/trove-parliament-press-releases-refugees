TRANSCRIPT OF THE HON. TONY ABBOTT MHR   JOINT DOORSTOP INTERVIEW WITH FIONA SCOTT,   LIBERAL CANDIDATE FOR LINDSAY   PENRITH



Subjects: Election 2010.

E&OE……………………….………………………………………………………………………………..

TONY ABBOTT:

It’s nice to be here at Panthers with Fiona Scott our excellent candidate for Lindsay and I’m just going to  talk a little bit about western Sydney and then I’m going to make a few comments about tomorrow and then  obviously it’s over to you for questions if that’s your choice.

Look, western Sydney is a very important part of this election campaign. The people of western Sydney  have been well and truly dudded by Labor, first by State Labor now by Federal Labor. Nothing more  graphically illustrates the rip-off after rip-off that Labor has perpetrated against the people of Sydney than  the Parramatta to Epping railway line. This was first promised 12 years ago. It’s repeatedly been promised  and cancelled and now this train to nowhere has been embraced by Federal Labor. I think that the people of  western Sydney are not mugs. They realise that this is school halls on wheels and they’re not going to be  conned by yet another empty Labor promise.

Now, tomorrow I’ll be doing a western Sydney blitz starting quite early in the morning and I’m hoping to  cover five marginal seats in western Sydney in the course of tomorrow. Tomorrow won’t just be my western  Sydney blitz though, it will also be the Labor campaign launch. This is a remarkably late launch with just  five days to go before polling. It’s really quite odd that the Labor Party has left it this late to fully declare its  policies and to launch its campaign and there are still some huge question marks over just what Labor stands  for. The Prime Minister opened the campaign four weeks ago talking about the population pressures in  western Sydney, amongst others. But then she pretended that you could have a population debate without  talking about immigration. I’ve had the guts to set an immigration number. It involves a cut of more than  100,000 on last year’s immigration numbers and I challenge the Prime Minister to declare exactly what her  immigration number will be. Plainly there’s been a secret deal done with Kevin Rudd. In his last press  conference as Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said that there’s no way that Labor would move to the right on  boat people. Obviously there has been some deal done with Kevin Rudd and I can only assume that Kevin  Rudd will unravel the policy that Julia Gillard has been talking about for an East Timorese asylum  processing centre and I call on the Prime Minister to come clean about the secret deal with Kevin Rudd.

She said at the start of the campaign that all of her promises were going to be fully funded. Well, there has  been no serious expenditure reductions outlined by the Prime Minister in this campaign and I call on her to  be upfront with the Australian people. What is she going to cut in order to pay for her promises? We’ve been  upfront and she should be equally upfront. Finally, she says there should be a carbon price. Well, there’s

only one way to have a carbon price and that’s to have an emissions trading scheme or to have a carbon tax.  As sure as night follows day if Labor is re-elected there will be a carbon tax and that means your electricity  just keeps going up and up in price. Every time you turn on the lights you’ll pay. Every time you open the  fridge you’ll pay. Every time you get in the shower you’ll pay and I call on the Prime Minister to be honest  and upfront with the Australian people about the coming carbon tax. Stop fudging by talking about this  peoples’ assembly. She’s the Prime Minister. The Parliament has to make these decisions. Where exactly  does she stand on this issue?

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, there’s been some backwards and forwards between Mr Bitar and Mr Loughnane on the peoples’  forum versus the debate. Is there any agreement at this point?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, I’m hopeful that an agreement can be reached but the agreement should be reached on the basis of the  people of Brisbane getting the same deal as the people of Sydney had. Now, the people of Sydney got two  hours of unmediated contact with the respective party leaders. If it was good enough for the Prime Minister  to agree to that in western Sydney why won’t she agree to that in Brisbane?

QUESTION:

[Inaudible]

TONY ABBOTT:

I want to see the people of Brisbane get the same deal as the Prime Minister gave to the people of Sydney. If  it’s good enough…

QUESTION:

Don’t they deserve to see you debate the Prime Minister on the economy and don’t they deserve for you to  put forward your economic credentials to them?

TONY ABBOTT:

I’ve been putting forward my economic credentials every day. But you know we’ve had all sorts of  argument between politicians. We’ve had all sorts of argument between politicians and journalists. What’s  been largely missing from this campaign, except for last Wednesday night, is discussion between the people,  the public, the voters and the respective leaders and that’s what I want to see more of. Let’s have two hours  of it in Brisbane as we had two hours in Sydney.

QUESTION:

[Inaudible]

TONY ABBOTT:

I will be there on Wednesday night to talk to the people of Brisbane and I expect the Prime Minister to be  there as well.

QUESTION:

If she agrees to this format the two hours similar to Sydney, but said she’ll agree to it if there’s an hour  debate on the economy first, would you agree to that sort of compromise?

TONY ABBOTT:

As I said what needs to happen is we’ve got to give the same deal to the people of Brisbane as was given to  the people of Sydney. If it was good enough to do this for the people of western Sydney why isn’t it good  enough for the people of Brisbane and I don’t know why the Prime Minister is running so scared of  Queensland. What is it about Queenslanders that makes the Prime Minister want to run from them and not  give them the same time that she gave to the people of western Sydney?

QUESTION:

[inaudible] their cuts, but you also have $30 billion of spending that you haven’t completely offset yet.  When will you reveal all of your cuts?

TONY ABBOTT:

I don’t accept the proposition that you put to me. We have fully costed and fully funded all of our  expenditure in this campaign. So far there’s $30 billion worth of spending reductions that we’ve been  upfront about. There’s just over $29 billion worth of campaign promises and we’ve been very upfront about  them. Now, there will be more to be revealed in this area in the next few days but people can be very  confident that under the Coalition, spending will be lower and debt will be less, significantly lower and  significantly less.

QUESTION:

You talk about the people of western Sydney and the people of Queensland though. What about the people  of Victoria, what about the people of South Australia, Tasmania and Western Australia? Don’t they deserve  some of your time and don’t they deserve to see you debate Julia Gillard on the economy?

TONY ABBOTT:

I’ve been giving a lot of my time in this campaign in various states but the opportunity is here for a  discussion with the people. To give the people two hours of unmediated access to the respective party  leaders. I think that the people of Brisbane deserve this. That’s the offer that’s on the table and if the Prime  Minister had the guts to face up to the people of Queensland, that’s exactly what she would accept.

QUESTION:

What will you be proposing instead of the Parramatta to Epping Rail Link?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think that the people of Sydney are not mugs. They understand that with a $57 billion deficit, it’s a lot  harder to invest in infrastructure than it is with a $20 billion surplus. What I want to do is to get the debt and  deficit down because then the federal government will be in a better position to assist the state governments  to give the infrastructure that cities like Sydney need.

QUESTION:

So that’s nothing you’re promising people in western Sydney tomorrow?

TONY ABBOTT:

I am promising the people of western Sydney competent government. Competent government that respects  the taxpayers’ dollar and treats the Australian people with respect and courtesy. Above all else, which does  not mislead the Australian people by making false promises that are doomed to disappointment.

QUESTION:

If you were Prime Minister would you look at putting stricter rules or guidelines in place regarding the  timing of those launches?

TONY ABBOTT:

Again, look at what I’ve done. We had our launch a fortnight before the election. That’s the standard  practice over recent elections and I think that the Australian public deserve to be treated with reasonable  consideration and respect. That’s what I’ve tried to do throughout this campaign and that’s what I continue  to do as Party Leader in the years to come. Thank you.
