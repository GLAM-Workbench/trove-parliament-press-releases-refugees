Subjects: Coalition’s policy for Regional Deterrence Framework to Combat People  Smuggling

EO&E...........................................................................................................................................





LEON BYNER:

I want to talk about the Coalition’s immigration policy that’s been announced and that is that  a boat buyback scheme and bounties paid in Indonesia, a part of a crackdown on people  smuggling under a Coalition Government.  And what they are basically saying is that  Australian taxpayers would purchase leaking fishing boats from poor fisherman, I hope they  haven’t got mosquitoes on them, because I’ll ask Scott about that too, where intelligence  identified they planned to sell them to people smugglers.  Alright, so it’s called a Village  Watch program.  Impoverished Indonesians would also be eligible to be paid bounties if they  hand over crucial information under the Coalition’s Regional Deterrence policy.  Scott  Morrison, good morning.

SCOTT MORRISON:

G’day, Leon.

BYNER:

Now, you’re opposition, the government, is saying this is just naÃÂ¯ve rubbish.  What do you  say to that?



MORRISON:

Well they’re the government that brought over 50,000 people to Australia on their policy so I  don’t think they are in any position to make any judgement at all.  What this policy is about  Leon, and this is only a very small part of it, what you’ve mentioned so far, is to put regional  deterrence in place.  If we want stronger borders in Australia, we need stronger borders in the  region.  That means we need a greater police presence working with the Indonesian National  Police up through Indonesia but also in Malaysia and also in Sri Lanka.  We need to give the  people who are doing that police work the tools they need to do the job and those tools means  bounties like you would operate here in Australia if you’re trying to get  information.  Reaching out into those communities to get information to disrupt and arrest  and stop these people getting on boats.

BYNER:

Ok...



MORRISON:

I’ll just make this point - every time a boat turns up in Australia, Leon, it’s costing the  Australian taxpayer about $12.8 million.  So that’s what it costs if we let the boat come to  Australia, so we need to do everything we can to make sure that boat never leaves Indonesia.

BYNER:

So let’s say Mr Fisherman gets an offer from a people smuggler to buy his boat, right?  And  currently he just sells it and needs the money and then they sell these passengers for $10,000  a ticket and all that sort of stuff, we know that.  Ok.  So what would be different here?

MORRISON:

What would be different here is, first of all, we’d be working in those villages and in those  communities to find out where the smugglers are moving and what they’re looking to do and  from that we will be able to identify where we would need to use these arrangements, the  tools available for people go and buy those boats if that’s what they need to do.  But that will  be left as an operational decision for people who are working within each of those villages.  I  mean, the bigger part of the program, which is actually the more expensive part of the  program, is just getting out and getting in to up to 100 villages across Indonesia in the first  place.  Now this was done with the counterterrorism initiatives after the Bali bombing where  there was an excellent partnership between the Indonesian National Police and the Australian  Federal Police and we worked in villages all across Indonesia and it was tremendously  successful, and that’s what we plan to do again in this area.

BYNER:

So can you say how much and how many boats would be brought back?

MORRISON:



First of all, they would be destroyed if we were to take them on but secondly we would never  give people smugglers a heads up about how we would do that operationally, they will find  out our tactics when they’re confronted by them.

BYNER:

Ok so you buy the boats and destroy them.

MORRISON:

That’s right.

BYNER:

So notionally, a people smuggler has bought a boat from a fisherman or has an arrangement  to get the boat handed over and he has...

MORRISON:

We would get it before they did.  That’s the whole point, the...

BYNER:

Then you go and buy the boat so they haven’t got that boat.

MORRISON:

That’s right.  There’s every...

BYNER:

So ...



MORRISON:

That’s right.

BYNER:

Well see, what could easily happen, these are market forces so you’ll cause a shortage of  boats so that the people smuggler will then go to another fisherman and offer more to buy the  boat he couldn’t buy before and then he’ll put the price of the passage up and they’ll probably  get it.



MORRISON:

Well if the prices go up then people are less likely to get on these things, particularly when  they are also faced with the risk of being turned back at sea which is also our policy, genuine  offshore processing and everything else we’ve got in place and they may not even get to the

beach because with our intelligence network we build up by what we’re doing to outreach to  the villages and having a greater policy presence.  All of this disrupts along the whole  way.  We’ve talked about this many times, it’s no one thing, you’ve got to have everything...

BYNER:

Alright.

MORRISON:

This is another tool we will put in the kit to make ensure that we frustrate and disrupt.

BYNER:

Scott, are you aware of a very important story where there are researchers at the University of  Queensland who’ve identified a deadly threat, mosquito threat, out of Indonesia into  Australia?

MORRISON:

I just had a briefing, well I heard of it this morning talking to someone up in North  Queensland actually.  I mean these are sort of the risks that are posed but you would want to  get a proper briefing on the nature of the risks and the best measures to mitigate against  it.  All of these things pose as potential risks when your borders are out of control and that’s  why we have to gain control of them and under this government 50,000 people have turned  up on over 800 boats.

BYNER:

The point I keep making is that we are generally seeing border protection discussed at a  political level almost exclusively about boat incursions.  Now I know there’s a good reason  for that because the debt that it’s caused, the overreach of money that they didn’t think they’d  have to spend that they have is over $11 billion ...

MORRISON:

That’s right.

BYNER:

But border protection is also about quarantine, it’s about not bringing diseases, it’s all those  things and again we hear about the people smuggling but what about all those other issues?

MORRISON:

Well all of those are important as well, Leon, stopping guns coming into the country is  important as well, stopping drugs coming into the country.  I mean, it isn’t just about people  smuggling.  People smuggling is the area where the government has most lost control but all  of these also require focus, you’ve got to get your borders under control for all those  reasons.  The Coalition’s determination on people smuggling will be equalled by our

commitment on all of these other issues including the quarantine issues and disease  issues.  We will protect and secure our borders, that’s what Coalition Governments do.

BYNER:

Alright, now we’ve had a couple of emailers asking the question, given that there appears to  be quite a bit of corruption in Indonesia and many countries like this, isn’t that really a big  problem for us?

MORRISON:

Well it is and that’s often the case, it’s also the case in places like Papua New Guinea, that’s  just a natural fact of life that you have to deal with and that’s why you need to work closely  with the government of these countries.  I mean, we have an excellent relationship with  Indonesia and the measures we are announcing today are all about putting some substance  into those relationships, in terms of tackling and addressing people smuggling.  It’s not good  enough just to get on planes and going to conferences, that’s Kevin Rudd’s approach, he gets  on planes and goes and has meetings and then nothing ever happens.  This is about putting  police in place.  This is about having rewards for getting information that stops boats leaving  Indonesia, this is about putting stronger border controls at points of entry into Indonesia and  Malaysia.  It’s also, Leon, about increasing Indonesia’s capability to respond in search and  rescue situations off the southern Javan coast.  So these are all practical things we’re talking  about, things that would actually happen, not just people going to meetings on planes.



BYNER:

There’s another point here.  You talk as if people smuggling is a serious issue and I don’t  think anybody will have a problem with that, except that we’ve sent back to Indonesia people  who were charged with people smuggling offences and we’ve also seen Indonesia itself  regard very lightly, in a legal sense, people smuggling as an offence.  Now isn’t that part of a  problem?

MORRISON:

Of course it is.  This government under their own Attorney General gave an instruction not to  prosecute first time offenders running boats to Australia.  That’s what Nicola Roxon  instructed her officials to do in terms of people coming to Australia illegally by boat and the  crews.  So how can anyone take a government seriously that’s prepared to do that?  And this  is part of the point, how can the region take Australia seriously on these issues when  Australia isn’t stumping up in terms of their own responsibilities?  That’s why we’re saying  very clearly today, in an encouraging message to the region as an offer, the regional  cooperation you will get from a Coalition Government is one that’s backed up with resources  and a commitment to actually do things, not just attend meetings.

BYNER:

Now, there’s one other point here, you’re quoted as saying today that not only will buying the  boats have an impact but you are also talking about stopping passengers getting into  Indonesia in the first place.



MORRISON:

That’s right

BYNER:

Clearly, what they’re doing is going to an airport with documents and buying an air ticket and  getting on a plane.  How are you going to stop that?

MORRISON:

Well we already have in Australia advanced passenger clearance processes and there’s  technology associated with that.  There’s the need to train border officials in Indonesia and  put different technology in place.  You’ll find all those things in Singapore and we’ve had  those discussions with officials there.  It’s about getting the better technology and better  processes into airports in Indonesia and Malaysia and there’s been some improvement in that  of late but we need to keep working on that.  As I said, it’s about having stronger borders in  the region to have stronger borders in Australia, and that’s what regional cooperation should  focus on.  It’s all been very airy fairy with the government when they talk about regional  cooperation. These are hard tangible measures that will be introduced and meaningful  cooperation that delivers the deterrence outcome.

BYNER:

Alright, Scott Morrison, thank you.  That’s the Coalition’s Immigration Spokesperson, Scott  Morrison, explaining their election policy with regards to asylum seekers.
