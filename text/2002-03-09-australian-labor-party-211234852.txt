“Making families our top priority”

Speech to the Townsville ALP Regional Conference CWA Hall Cnr Walker and Denham Streets, Townsville, Saturday 9 March 2002

Wayne Swan Manager of Opposition Business Shadow Minister for Family and Community Services

Introduction

We may be three years from the demise of the Howard Government but I will make an early prediction this Government will be remembered as the most arrogant administration in our history as a nation.

No Governments has embarked on an orchestrated campaign of fear and loathing on the scale of that which was prosecuted by the Howard Government before the election.

This is evidence that the leadership of the Liberal Party - John Howard and Peter Costello - lack principle and decency. They will do anything to save their political hides.

But it is not in itself a sign of arrogance.

What is so arrogant about this Government is how it intends to use its dubious mandate during the next three years.

We saw an early indication during the week.

The Treasurer has been under siege for playing fast and loose on the currency markets and losing $4.8 billion of taxpayer’s money in just four years.

To put this into context - that’s around $250 for every man woman and child that has been lost from Peter Costello’s gambling.

What we learned on Wednesday was that the Government’s Budget razor gang - headed by the Treasurer - intends to recoup these foreign currency losses by slashing the pensions of 630,000 disabled people in the coming Federal Budget.

No one was told prior to the election this was on the cards - in fact it was denied.

Now less than four months later the real agenda is being laid bare.

This is the style of the Howard Government - force the most vulnerable in our community to pay for the worst excesses of the most powerful.

Weak in controlling the strong but strong in controlling the weak.

This is why the Howard Government is an arrogant Government.

Truth overboard

The Howard Government’s election strategy was more than just ‘Tampa’ and ‘kids overboard’ - though these were obviously vital.

We can see now it involved not only the creation of a crisis in the form of Tampa, but the active suppression of bread and butter domestic issues that make a difference for average families.

The revelations at Senate Estimates Hearings show how the Prime Minister set out before the election with the children overboard incident and Tampa to manufacture an issue that would block out any scrutiny of his personal record, the crises in our health and education systems and the paucity of the Coalition’s policy ideas for the next three years.

Some four months and two inquiries later have are closer to the truth. There were no children thrown overboard and the Government’s so-called “Pacific Solution” was an expensive electoral solution and no more.

John Howard is the only person left in this country who thinks his defence against lying about children being thrown overboard has any credibility.

Peter Costello had a part to play in all this too. He sat on the Government’s National Security Committee and he diverted taxpayer’s money to fund the Pacific Solution.

He coldly calculated that his best interests were served by John Howard’s Tampa trap - now he is handcuffed to the man who will be remembered for his deception.

But Howard and Costello’s deception extends beyond the boat people saga.

Recent evidence to Senate Estimates hearings show how the Government also suppressed the truth about its flawed family payment system to enhance its electoral position.

Despite promising to notify every family saddled with a family payment debt prior to the election, this did not occur. The Government suppressed the letters until after November 10.

600,000 Australian families were kept in the dark by Centrelink on the instructions of the Howard Government in the lead up to the election.

Labor was mocked and derided by Senator Vanstone seven days before the election when we blew the whistle that the Government wasn’t telling families they would get debt letters after November 10.

The Government said all families were being phoned. But like the kids overboard story this wasn’t true.

This was the second big lie of the election campaign.

What we now know is that less than one fifth of the 600,000 families who had incurred a debt were told the truth prior to the election.

Most of those who were told, were families covered by the Government’s $1,000 waiver - the quick fix introduced to secure the Aston by-Election result last July.

Most of those not covered by the waiver - around 150,000 of the 600,000 -are facing the rude shock of average debts of $1040 - the result of a deeply flawed payments system the Government is too mean-spirited to fix.

Howard and Costello also neglected to tell Australian families with private health cover before the election that the big insurers were preparing to ask for double digit increases in their premiums.

On the contrary, the Prime Minister hailed the Government’s Private Health Rebate as a measure that would keep the cost of premiums down.

After the election one of the first decisions taken by the new Howard-Costello led Cabinet was to grant large increases to health insurers adding some $150 to families’ private health insurance bills.

There is every indication that over the next three years John Howard intends to turn the screws on ordinary Australians further.

Having pulled the wool over everyone’s eyes on November 10 he will be bolder - slugging working families at every turn.

You only need to look at the efforts of Howard’s protÃÂ©gÃÂ© Tony Abbott over the past two weeks.

While Costello is left to explain his $5 billion currency gambling habit, Abbott is busy advancing his own Leadership ambitions off the back of ordinary workers.

Rather than admitting the Government is yet again opposing an increase in minimum award wages, Abbott tried last week to distract people’s attention by floating the idea of tax credits in the future.

Of course there was no detail, no costings and no promises.

Tax credits have been examined and advanced by Labor for some time as a way of helping people move from welfare to work.

But their appeal for Tony Abbott lies in their ability to be used to justify wage cuts rather than boosting people’s income.

It is a classic case of twisting good policy to meet the Government’s coldhearted ends.

Abbott has an additional motive in spruiking Labor policy.

He is pitching himself to the top end of town as a future Leader - one who is prepared to pursue radical industrial relations reforms and cuts to the current wage floor.

If you look at the emerging program being articulated by Howard, Costello and Abbott - all of them desperate to enhance their own power at any cost -you get a real sense of just how mean-spirited the third Howard Government will be:

- deep welfare cuts; - turning the screws on families tighter through the continuation of the family debt trap and private health fee hikes; and - radical industrial reforms that lower working conditions and cut

wages

This is a coldhearted program far removed from what was promised before November 10.

The way ahead

The arrogance and mean-spiritedness of the Howard Government provides opportunities for Labor.

5

But we must make sure our policies are grounded in local communities. They must spring from and be pitched to families from Townsville to Tuncurry, Penrith to Perth and Maroochydore to Mallacoota.

Our policies should recognise we all live in a community, not a corporation.

Australian families want a plan for the future - one that rewards their hard work and sacrifices, one that recognises the tension between work on the one hand and family life on the other.

Work and family

For this reason we need to elevate families and children to the top of the policy agenda.

Family policy, properly understood, is not about forcing women to have more children, or keeping them in the home, or any other such antiquated rubbish. It is simply about things that you would want to do anyway - making it easier for families to have and care for children.

Families should be able to expect both a fair share of the economic good times and a good family life. Government policy should be directed at achieving these twin goals. We shouldn’t be washing our hands of the problem, and we certainly shouldn’t be in there up to our elbows making it worse.

Too often, the very conservatives who talk about family values have radical economic policies which only push the market further into family lives.

Our current Prime Minister, despite all his rhetoric to the contrary, puts market values ahead of family values.

That is what he has done in promoting industrial reforms that make the work-life balance harder for families; in approving hefty increases in private health insurance premiums; and in designing a family payments system that traps families in debt.

We need a government prepared to join battle on the side of average families - to give them the tools and the support they need to confront change - to put them first rather than last.

Labor should make families its top priority.

I believe a good start would be with paid maternity leave. Indeed my colleague, Labor’s Deputy leader Jenny Macklin, talked about the importance of the issue in a speech to CEDA yesterday.

6

There will be issues about the cost of paid maternity leave and who pays for it but we shouldn’t let this get in the way of adopting the policy itself.

The level of women’s workforce participation in Australia demands that we address the dilemma they face if they decide to have children.

There are now demonstrated links between the provision of family friendly policies like paid maternity leave and improving birthrates.

Or to put it another way, women the world over are deciding against having children in where there is no provision for them to integrate work and having a family.

Apart from the United States we are now the only developed nation in the world that does not offer some form of paid leave to parents following the birth of a child.

While paid maternity leave is essential it is only one element of an effective work-family policy.

We must look to build on the opportunity paid maternity leave provides by ensuring there is a comprehensive platform of early childhood services to support and enrich children during the first three years of their lives.

We currently have a patchwork quilt of services - childcare, maternal and child health, family support and early education - that is fragmented and inaccessible.

We need a root and branch reappraisal of services for children and families and we have to make sure young families get all the services they need to be good families. That means changing the way Governments plan and fund child and family services.

If we get the work and family policy mix right we will attract what I would term the outer suburban middle classes who failed to come across to Labor last time.

I have previously referred to this group as the ‘Westfield Mallers’ because the shopping centre is the hub of their social interaction.

They are part of what Theda Skocpol calls the ‘missing middle’ - families who live on modest wages or wages made modest by the cost of their responsibilities to their children.

These are the people who are juggling work and family responsibilities; they are the ones having children but being punished by an out of step Howard Government for doing so.

7

Other bold reforms

The missing middle are sick of the business as usual approach to politics where their concerns are ‘heard’ but not acted on.

That’s why we need to be bold.

We need to look at making changes to our major institutions - the constitution; our parliament; but also our party structures.

On the constitutional front we should reconsider a Republic in the form supported by most Australians - with a popularly elected President. We should also look at fixed four-year terms for Parliament.

Parliament also needs to be modernised.

Labor Leader Simon Crean and I have previously suggested a number of areas for reform in the interests of democracy and good government.

We need to strengthen the Standing Orders to make Ministers actually answer the questions they are asked in Parliament. We currently give them unlimited time to say anything but what people want to hear. Time limits should apply.

The independence of the Speaker should also be increased. There are challenges in moving to the British model given the small number of Members in the House of Representatives, but we should examine the options.

Bold policies

Our policy review chaired by Jenny Macklin is very important if we are to ensure our policies are right next time round.

In addition to a strong work and family agenda we can meet people’s concerns with a focus on:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Investment in opportunities; and Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Greater reward for effort

Investment in opportunities

Too many Australians live not only in material poverty but also a poverty of opportunity.

I see our challenge is to convince the ‘missing middle’ that social investments benefit everyone.

8

They have been fed a constant diet of fear and loathing by the Howard Government - this must stop.

An investment in our social infrastructure makes us all the richer, without it we are all the poorer.

As a first step in providing opportunity we must restore the public’s faith in our ailing health and education systems. We need to continue to argue that poor health or sub-standard education makes it almost impossible for people to move forward.

Greater reward for effort

Complementary to investing in opportunity is to make sure that people are rewarded for their efforts.

It is about time that we put some decent financial incentives into the system at the bottom and the middle to reward hard work and effort.

Tax credits are just one of a number of options for doing this.

We need to overturn the notion propagated by John Howard and his Ministers that we can only motivate the rich by giving them greater incentives but can only motivate the poor by giving them less.

Conclusion

The John Howard-Peter Costello show is one of practiced deception.

Many Australian families live with growing financial pressures because of the mean-spirited policies of the Howard-Costello Government.

And the early signs are things are only going to get worse during the next three years.

By pursuing a bold and outward looking policy agenda Labor can short circuit John Howard’s attempts to remake Australia in his own callous image.

Labor’s way forward rests in being able to appeal to the Australian people’s hopes and aspirations, not to their fears. To convince them we will stand up for the Australian ethos.

We need to make the great missing middle a priority. These families who are under pressure from the current Government want bold reforms, particularly ones that recognise their contribution to our future.

I’m convinced that if we can demonstrate that connection, Australians will embrace Labor, and we’ll have the great opportunity to put the Howard years

behind us and restore some decency, fairness and above all, honesty, to Australian public life.
