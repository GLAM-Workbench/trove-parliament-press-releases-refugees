TURNBULL GOVERNMENT PLAYS PETTY POLITICS WITH NZ RESETTLEMENT  OFFER

The Turnbull Government has repeatedly failed to explain why they won’t accept New  Zealand’s generous offer to resettle eligible refugees from Manus Island and Nauru with  reports claiming the Turnbull Government has asked New Zealand to keep its offer on  the table.

If true, these reports are proof Peter Dutton has been playing petty politics with  vulnerable people rather than doing his job and negotiating third country resettlement  agreements for refugees.

Labor has repeatedly called on the Turnbull Government to accept New Zealand's offer  to resettle eligible refugees from Manus and Nauru and negotiate conditions similar to  the US refugee resettlement agreement to prevent people smugglers exploiting  vulnerable people.

If the Government was able to negotiate conditions for the US deal, they should be able  to negotiate them for any deal with NZ - an offer recommended they should accept by a  Senate Inquiry, vocal community concern, calls from Labor, and even Liberal MPs  urging the Prime Minister to do so.

Labor strongly supports the US refugee resettlement deal but it won’t resettle every  eligible refugee.

Labor will never let the people smugglers back in business and that is why Australia is  not, and must not be, a resettlement option.

Every time Peter Dutton lies about Labor’s strong position on border protection, he is a  walking, talking billboard for the people smugglers and he should be ashamed of  himself.

If Peter Dutton is going to play petty politics, it's time Malcolm Turnbull shows some  leadership and accepts New Zealand's generous offer - including negotiating  appropriate conditions - to resettle eligible refugees from Manus and Nauru in third  countries as soon as possible .
