BUDGET DECISIONS AFFECTING EDUCATION

STATEMENT BY THE COMMONWEALTH MINISTER FOR EDUCATION, MR WAL. FIFE.

Total Commonwealth expenditure on education will grow by

10 per cent during 1980/81, up $260 million to $2867 million.

Major elements in this increase are:

.  schools, up $112 million

. universities, colleges of advanced education and

technical and further education (TAFE) colleges,

up $125 million

.  financial assistance for students, up $19 million

ASSISTANCE FOR STUDENTS

The Commonwealth Government has decided on a wide range of

increases in benefits for students and their parents.

Major allowances under the Assistance for Isolated Children

Scheme (AIC) and the Secondary Allowances Scheme (SAS) will

increase 20 per cent.

Allowances under the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme

(Â£EAS) and other schemes will rise by 10 per cent.

Means tests affecting benefits under all schemes will be

adjusted. All changes will apply from the beginning of 1981.

Details of the changes are set out in the Attachment.

TERTIARY EDUCATION ASSISTANCE SCHEME (TEAS)

The increases in benefits under TEAS re-affirm the

Government’s commitment to providing help for tertiary students

on the basis of need. The higher allowances also recognise

the increases in costs borne by parents who help to support

their children during tertiary study.

2.

The following maximum rates of assistance will apply in

1981, subject to a means test:

At home:  $32.21 a week ($29.29 previously)

,  Away from home: $49.67 ($45.15 previously)

Independent: $49.67 ($45.15 previously).

The level of family income (after specified deductions) at which

maximum benefits will be payable will increase from $9400 to

$10,312. The allowance for a dependent spouse will be increased

from $31.40 to $42.70 a w e e k ,  and for each dependent child from  $7.50 to $10 a week.

From 1981, students will be able to earn up to $2000,

including up to $500 from any other award,  before affecting

the amount payable under TEAS. Previous limits were $1500 and

$150 respectively.

About 89,000 students will receive benefits under TEAS next

year.

Postgraduate Awards (PGA)

The stipend and dependants' allowances under the Postgraduate

Awards Scheme will also be increased for 1981.

The stipend will be increased from $4200 for 1980 to $4620

for 1981, while the allowances for dependants will be increased

in line with the increases under TEAS.

The Government has taken note of the recommendation of the

Williams Committee of Inquiry into Education and Training

that the numbers of new Postgraduate Awards made available

should be increased.

As a result, 800 new awards will be provided for 1981, compared

with 700 for 1980. This will allow for 80 extra Research Awards,

15 extra Course Awards and five Advanced Education Institution

Awards in 1981.

About 2000 Postgraduate Award holders will receive assistance

in 1981.

Adult Secondary Education Assistance Scheme (ASEAS)

ASEAS assists mature students 'to undertake the final year of

secondary study.

The increases in allowances and adjustments in means tests

which are to apply to TEAS for 1981 will also be extended to

cover ASEAS.

An estimated 1950 students will receive ASEAS benefits next

year.

Secondary Allowances Scheme (SAS)

SAS provides support for families with limited financial

resources to assist them to support student children in the

final two years of secondary school.

Maximum benefits will be increased by 20 per cent for 1981

to $660 ($550 in 1980) subject to a means test and payable

on a family income (after specified deductions) of $7440 up

by 207= ($6200 in 1980).

About 25,000 students are expected to benefit under SAS in

1981.

Assistance for Isolated Children (AIC)

The Assistance for Isolated Children Scheme is primarily

aimed at helping families whose homes are remote from normal

school facilities.  About 20,500 students will be assisted under

the scheme during 1981. ,

Both the basic boarding allowance and the additional, boarding allowance

will be increased from the present $500 a year to $600 for 1981. The

basic boarding allowance will continpe to be free of means test.

The special supplementary allowance would be increased by

20 per cent to $360 a year for primary pupils,  $540 a year

for junior secondary pupils,and $660 a year for senior

secondary pupils.

For 1981, maximum benefits will be payable where the family

income (after specified deductions) does not exceed $10,312

for the additional boarding allowance and $7440 for the special

supplementary allowance, compared with the present levels of ^

4 .

$9400 and $6200.

The Government has also decided that allowances payable where

a family maintains a second home to allow their children to

attend school should be increased substantially: for example,

where there are three children in the family, the basic

allowance will be $1530 in 1981, compared with the present

rate of $1275.

The provisions of the scheme have also been widened to

include categories of handicapped children not previously

eligible for assistance and those who are obliged to live away

from home for medical reasons.

-Assistance for Aboriginal Students

Recent figures have confirmed the value of both the Aboriginal

Study Grants Scheme (Abstudy) and the Aboriginal Secondary

Grants Scheme (Abseg),  showing that Aboriginal children are

staying at school longer and older students are enrolling in

an ever-widening range of courses designed to meet their

particular needs.

For 1981 the various boarding and living at home allowances

under Abseg will rise by 10 per cent and the books and clothing

allowance will rise by 20 per cent. Details are set out in the

attachment.

Under the Abstudy scheme, living allowances will rise by

10 per cent and the allowance for first dependant will rise

from $31.40 a week to $42.70 a week. The allowance for each

additional dependant will rise from $7.50 to $10 a week.

Adjustments have also been made to the establishment and

clothing allowances. Details are set out in the attachment.

During 1981 about 10,000 students are expected to receive

Abstudy grants and another 16,500 under Abseg.

TRANSITION FROM SCHOOL TO WORK PROGRAM

Ã¢ÂÂ   The Commonwealth will make available $32.9 million during

./5

5 .

1980/81 to provide appropriate education and training

opportunities for young people leaving school with poor

employment prospects.

Currently, about $20 million has been committed for

proposals put forward by State and Territorial authorities

for 1980.

For the calendar year 1981, the Commonwealth will make available

$27.4 million, and it expects that the States will contribute a

total of $9.9 million to bring the total cost of the Program in that

year to $37.3 million. -

EDUCATION PROGRAM FOR UNEMPLOYED YOUTH (EPUY)

Estimated expenditure under EPUY for 1980/81 is $4.0 million,

an increase of $0.4 million over the total for 1979-80.

Further funds will be available under the Transition from

School to Work Program, program, providing for an estimated

increase of about 50. per cent in the number of students in

EPUY courses.

CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT CENTRE Ã¢ÂÂ

Significant increases are planned for the work of the CDC

in mathematics, language development, science and Aboriginal

education during 1980/81?and a major project will be the

further development of the concept of "core curriculum".

Expenditure for the Centre's programs will increase by $0.1

million to $2.5 million in 1980/81.

CDC operates in co-operation with the States and nonÂ­

government authorities to produce teaching and learning

materials for primary and secondary schools.

EDUCATION RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COMMITTEE (ERDC)

Funding for the ERDC will increase $0.2 million to $1.2

million in 1980/81, allowing an increase in grants for projects

in areas of particular concern to the Government.

HANDICAPPED CHILDREN

For 1980/81, an additional $1 million will be provided

under the Schools Commission's Special Education Program

for special support teaching services necessary to allow the

integration of about 300 handicapped children into normal

schools.

REFUGEE EDUCATION

About 5500 school-aged refugee children are expected to

arrive in Australia during 1980/81 under the Government's

Refugee and Special Humanitarian Programs .

An extra $0.6 million will be provided for the Commonwealth

Contingency Program for Refugee Children, bringing total funds

for 1980/81 to $3.3 million.

GRANTS-IN-AID

Eight educational organisations are to receive grants-in-

aid totalling $483,500 during 1980/81. Â·

The largest single grant is for the Australian Council for

Educational Research, which will receive $319,000, an increase

of $24,000 over the amount for 1979/80.

It is usual for State governments as a. group to match the

Commonwealth contribution.

A new grant-in-aid of $30,000 will go to Outward Bound

Australia to assist in the development of courses offered

for young people and to help keep course fees at a reasonable

level. The grant is in recognition of outstanding achievement

by a voluntary organisation.

The United World Colleges Trust will receive $28,000, compared

with $18,000)in 1979/80, which will provide for four (two in

1979/80,)scholarships for Australian students in the final two

years of secondary schooling to study at United World Colleges

in Singapore, Canada or Wales.

Other grants-in-aid for 1980/81 include $25,000 for the

Australian Council of State Schools Organisations, the level

to which its grant-in-aid was raised during 1979/80, $16,500

for the Australian Parents Council, an increase of $1500, and

$35,000 for the Australian Music Examinations Board.

The grant for the Current Affairs Bulletin,  produced by

the Adult Education Department of the University of Sydney,

has been reduced from $15,000 to $10,000 and the grant for the

Australian Association of Adult Education will increase by

$3000 to $20,000.

EDUCATION IN THE AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY

Three new secondary schools will open in Canberra next year.

They are Erindale College, Wanniassa High School and Charnwood

High School.

The ACT Schools Authority has been allocated additional funds

to open the schools despite the Government's continued emphasis

on expenditure restraint. Initial funding and staffing costs

will be kept to a minimum.

Total expenditure on ACT government schools in 1980/81 will

be $78.8 million.

Recurrent expenditure, will rise by 7 per cent to $74.8 million.

Capital expenditure is,however, expected to fall from $7.3 million

to $4.0 million because school enrolments have levelled off, thus

reducing the need for new schools.

During 1980/81, $1.7 million has been set aside for modification

of the ventilation systems of a number of ACT government schools

as part of a continuing program extending over several years.

The amount will enable a substantial acceleration of the modification

program. Ã¢ÂÂ

Non-Government Schools

A total of $11.6 million will be made available to ACT nonÂ­

government schools in recurrent per capita grants in 1980/81.

Another $0.4 million will be made available under other programs, ^g

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ 8

Ã¢ÂÂ¢  Another $0.4 million will be made available under other programs,   such as text book subsidies and library grants.

An estimated $3.5 million will be provided for new and existing

school capital works,  including funds for the erection of two

Catholic systemic primary schools,  at Wanniassa and Kaleen,

expected to open in 1982.

Further Education *  *

Recurrent expenditure on ACT Further Education in 1980/81

will rise by 18 per cent over the amount for the previous

year to a total $14.4 million.

Spending on plant and equipment will show a rise of 35 per

cent to $1 million, allowing for the equipment of major new *  '

buildings and the replacement of obsolete equipment. Funds

available for furniture and fittings will rise from $0.3

million, to $1 million.

Funds made available in the program of the National Capital

Development Commission for capital works will fall from $11.7

million in 1979/80 to $7.7 million in 1980/81, reflecting the

tapering off of the extensive building program carried on in

recent years.

A start will, however, be made on the central services building

for the Canberra College of Technical and Further Education,

to cost $3.9 million.

From the beginning of 1981, Woden TAFE College will occupy

its major new building in the Woden Town Centre and the Canberra

School of Art will occupy its new buildings in Acton.
