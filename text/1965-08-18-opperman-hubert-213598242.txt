PRESS STATEMENT BY THE MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION,

THE HON. HUBERT OPPERMAN, M.P.

The Minister for Immigration, Mr. Opperman, said

to-day that the Government intended to maintain the marked

upward trend in the immigration programme.

Its aim for 1965/66 was at least 145,000 settlers,

5.000 more than last year's result which was the best for any

year except 1949/50.

The figure would include 90,000 assisted migrants -70.000 from Britain and 20,000 recruited by Australian migration

missions in 11 countries in Europe.

Another 55,000 settlers paying their own fares were

expected to come to Australia, mainly from British andÂ· southern

European countries.

Most of the southern European settlers would be from .

Italy and Greece and sponsored by people already settled in

Australia.

Mr. Opperman said that the arrival of 140,157

settlers during 1964/65 was the best result since 1949/50.

"In that year, when we received 133,929 assisted

settlers, as well as many thousands who paid their own fares,

Australia was a haven for refugees from countries still suffering

the effects of the w a r .

"It is a considerable achievement that, in these days

of prosperity and comport in Britain and Europe,  Australia can

still attract migrants in increasing numbers.

"Over the past three years the intake of settlers

has been rising steadily. In 1962/63 we received 101,888

settlers. In 1963/64 the figure rose to 122,318.

"In the past year we have received more than 140,000

settlers and now we look forward to at least 145,000.

"As in the past, the past, the progress of the programme

will be kept under review and the flow increased if opportunity

offers", Mr. Opperman said.
