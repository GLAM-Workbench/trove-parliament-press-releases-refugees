E&EO…………………………………………………………………………………………..

RAY HADLEY:

The Immigration Minister has been copping some flak this week for daring to speak  what I consider to be the truth and he joins me right now from our Canberra Studio.

Minister good morning.

PETER DUTTON:

Good morning Ray.

RAY HADLEY:

Look I don’t know why all the handwringers have gone on about this comment in  relation to the Fraser Government’s immigration policies.

If I can just share - and I’ve done this stacks of times - we go back to 2006, an  article that appeared in Fairfax, I think by Gerard Henderson, the Liberal leader  Malcolm Fraser became Prime Minister in late 1975 around the time of the outbreak  of the Lebanese civil war between Left leaning Muslims and Right leaning Maronite  Christians. Initially Fraser and his Immigration Ethnic Affairs Minister Michael  MacKellar were approached by Maronite Australians to allow some Lebanese  Christians who [inaudible] to settle here.

Fraser agreed, however it was not long before processes got out of hand. As it  turned out, very few Christians wanted to or were able to come to Australia.  Department officials were sent to Lebanon to administer the programme. They  began granting visas mainly to Muslims, often on the flimsiest evidence they had  close relatives or indeed any relative here. The programme became known as the  Lebanese Concession. The concession involved what was the Lebanese concerned  would be admitted to Australia under the refugee intake, despite the fact that strictly  speaking, they were not refugees. And so it goes on.

Now the other article I refer to was written by Matthew Franklin in The Australian, I  think in 2007: ‘Immigration authorities warned the Fraser Government in 1976 it was  accepting too many Lebanese Muslim refugees without required qualities for a  successful integration.’

‘Cabinet documents released back in 2007 under the 30 year rule reveal how  Australia’s decision to accept  thousands of Lebanese Muslims fleeing Lebanon’s  civil war in ‘76 led to a temporary collapse in normal eligibility standards. The  emergence of these documents raises the question of whether the temporary  relaxation might have contributed to the racial tensions in south-western Sydney’ and  so it goes on talking about the type of people that came here and they talk about  those people in the most terrible way.

Now I’ve had many meetings with Lebanese Maronite Christians - you know second  and third generation Australians - who tell me this is exactly what happened.

I don’t wish to labour the point, but it’s a bit like if someone said to us tomorrow ‘look  we’ll take 30,000 of your people’; well you go straight to Barwon Prison, you go  straight to Goulburn, you go straight to Bathurst and you say ‘well here’s a few  thousand to start, you can take them’, and I’m not suggesting we emptied prisons in  Lebanon of Muslim people, we got a lot of good Muslim people over a long period of  time, but we got some very crook ones under Malcolm Fraser and that’s just the way  it is.

PETER DUTTON:

Well Ray, a lot of what you’ve read out there is indisputable. I mean that’s the history  and that’s as I conveyed it. Now, I’m not going to be dishonest in this discussion. I’ve  spoken the truth.

What’s happened though is that Bill Shorten - I’ve seen a different side of Bill  Shorten this week, I mean some of his colleagues have spoken about this sort of  shifty, sneaky part of his character, which obviously Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard  saw - but he sought to completely misrepresent what I said.

The point that I was making is that we should call out the small number within the  community, within the Lebanese community, who are doing the wrong thing. If we do  that we can hold up the vast majority of people within the Lebanese community who  work as hard as you and I do, who have contributed to Australian society, who are  captains of industry, people that have worked hard, provided their kids with an  education; they are being besmirched, those good people are being besmirched by  these people within the Lebanese community who have done the wrong thing - and  that is no different to what any Lebanese leader would tell you and yet the Left as  you rightly point out, go off half-cocked.

I mean they hate me because of the refugee policy that we’ve got because we’ve  stopped the boats and they don’t like me as Immigration Minister, that’s fine. I can  tell you now Ray, I won’t cower to these people. Bill Shorten can carry on, be part of  the tricky elite in this country, he can talk double code to people, he can be tricky in  his language - I’m not going to be intimidated by it. It only gives me greater resolve

to make sure that in the work that I’m doing, we bring the right people into this  country, we celebrate the fact that we’ve brought some wonderful people into this  country over a long period of time that have made out country what it is today and  we celebrate that, but I am not going to allow those people, regardless of their ethnic  background, regardless of whether they were born here, whatever the case may be;  if they are doing the wrong thing, if they are seeking to do harm to our country or to  our people, then I will…I can promise you this; continue to stamp these people out  because I’m not going to allow any intimidation, I’m not going to be cowering like Mr  Shorten does in his backroom union deals - that’s what’s happened here the Left’s  run off as I say, because they’re not a fan of mine - it’s water off a duck’s back and it  just makes me more determined to make sure that we get the migration policy right.

I was criticised recently by Labor for saying that I was too slow in bringing the  Syrians in. Well you know what, because we’ve done the extra security checks that  needed to be done, we’ve found 22 people within those that were granted visas or  were about to be granted visas, who we were worried about and we didn’t allow  them in because of that decision, because I stared down Labor’s nonsense then, we  have brought people in who will do the right thing by our country, who will start a new  life with their family here and that’s what we want. We’ve got the vast majority of the  Lebanese community who are good, upstanding, decent, hardworking citizens that  provide for their kids, work hard in our community, they are being besmirched by this  minority, that’s the minority I spoke about and I’m not going to take one step  backwards.

RAY HADLEY:

Let me say this to you. I’ve had any number of meetings over the past decade with  members of the Lebanese Maronite Australian community and Lebanese Muslim  community in the same room, we’ve sat there, and we’ve broken bread and spoken  about this.

I’ve implored them to be public. They’ve said exactly what you’ve said, but for  varying reasons they are too scared to say what has been enunciated, all they’ve got  to do is repeat what was written by Matthew Franklin out of these papers. I mean the  Fraser Cabinet was told via these papers many of the refugees coming in as  Lebanese Muslim migrants were unskilled, illiterate and had questionable character.

You know what the Maronites say to me? ‘Ray, Mr Fraser got the worst of the worst,  he didn’t get the best of the best, he got the worst of the worst’, but they’re not  prepared to say it.

PETER DUTTON:

And Ray the irony here is that Matthew Franklin who wrote that article in 2007 is now  a senior adviser for Anthony Albanese.

As I say the facts here are indisputable which is why I feel comfortable where I am,  I’m on safe ground because I’ve relied on the facts. If people don’t understand the  history then they’ll make the same mistakes into the future and when we looked at  bringing people from Syria, I wanted to have a look at the way in which people were

brought into our country to provide assistance because Australians are generous  people. We want to provide support to people, but we aren’t going to have the hand  bitten that’s being extended by way of friendship. We aren’t going to allow people to  come into our country to do the wrong thing by Australian citizens.

We want people to come here to start a new life, work hard, provide a good  education for their kids - that’s been the history of migration in this country - but  there have been mistakes made and if we don’t learn from those mistakes, as I say,  we’ll repeat them again and I am not going to do that during my time as Immigration  Minister.

RAY HADLEY:

Well Bill Shorten knows the truth about what happened in 1976 and it is there for all  to see. Let me just remind everyone this is a conservative Minister Peter Dutton, he’s  not having a crack at Paul Keating or Bob Hawke, he’s enunciating what one of his  fellow Liberal Party politicians did in Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser. I mean you  could sort of take a pot….oh yeah Dutton, he’s having a crack at the Labor….he’s  having a crack at his own because Malcolm Fraser did this and he can stand on his  record for as long as he wants to on his hind legs; at the end of the day many of the  problems we encounter in south-western Sydney now are at the feet of one man;  Malcolm Fraser. That’s where they are. Anyway we’ll leave that and move on. I don’t  expect you’ll make any criticisms of your former Prime Minister.

I wanted to talk to you about this departure tax. There’s been a twist this morning  with Pauline Hanson saying she’ll comeback - and I don’t understand this, they must  be very forgiving in the Senate, they won with 31-30 and defeated your legislation  last night, but Pauline Hanson and Brian Burston from One Nation weren’t there.   Pauline was doing a doorstop somewhere or an interview somewhere, but now she  said that we’ll come back in today and we’ll revisit this and we want a sunset clause  after I think five or six years they’re talking about  - in other words it is in place for  that period of time and then it’s reviewed.

But I spoke to one of your colleagues this morning about how this works. Doesn’t  someone from One Nation know there’s an important vote on or do you think they  knew it was on and avoided it so they could throw this spanner in the works at the  last minute and then get it relooked at today?

PETER DUTTON:

Ray when you have a choice of conspiracy or stuff-up, I normally go for stuff-up.

RAY HADLEY:

So it was a stuff-up?

PETER DUTTON:

I suspect….look she just missed the vote. I don’t know why. She inadvertently no  doubt….she can explain it, which I think is what normally happens, they can

recommit the vote if they say ‘look you know I was intending to vote this way, but I  was delayed, I was stuck, didn’t hear the bells,’ whatever it was. So she has made a  mistake and I am sure she will stick her hand up and work that out and ultimately  she’ll support the Bill.

RAY HADLEY:

Ok, but will they cop her amendment? Will you cop her amendment do you think?

PETER DUTTON:

I’m not a party to the negotiations, but I think there is agreement on some  amendments, but Mathias Cormann and I think a couple of others in the Senate are  negotiating it. So i just haven’t been that close, but I think there is agreement. She is  happy to support the Bill in the amended form and hopefully it will be recommitted,  the Bill will be passed. It builds on the success, I mean this Registered Organisations  Bill that was passed this week is as big a win for the Government as the Australian  Building and Construction Commission will be because it really applies the same  onus on union leaders and others that we have on company directors. This is a big  win for a couple of million workers around the country.

People don’t want to be ripped-off. If they are paying their union dues they expect  the money to be spent wisely and I think this Bill has been a really good win for the  Government this week and hopefully the ABCC Bill goes through next week.

RAY HADLEY:

Well it appears up until now the only rules that union bosses observe is; if it’s not a  rort if you’re not involved.

PETER DUTTON:

It’s not a rort until you get caught.

RAY HADLEY:

Yeah or the benefit; you know it’s only a rort if you are not in it and that is  documented by Sharri Markson. Just interrupting, I’ve got a call here from a listener,  I just want you to hear what he has go to say. G’day George.

CALLER:

G’day Ray and g’day Mr Dutton. I actually can’t hear Mr Dutton now, he’s gone  blank, but I will say this; Mr Dutton thank you very much. My family were one of  those in 1976 who came here and I agree with Mr Dutton that a lot of them who  came here are just riffraff, they really were.

I come from a Christian minority, the Assyrian people who really suffered there and I  just want to say thank you again also to my [inaudible] who came here from Lebanon  as refugees from Syria and they are Christian minority again and they’ve come here

and I tell you what; they are going to make Australians proud. And not only thank Mr  Dutton, but thanks to the Australian people who got a big heart and I guarantee you  that they will make a great life here.

My family have grown up here. I own a business and employee people. My sister is a  police officer. We have intermarried. We’ve got Aussies in the family. We’ve got  Greeks and Italians. We basically integrate quite well into the community. I just want  to say thank you so much for the opportunity. Australia is a great country and we’ll  make Australia proud.

RAY HADLEY:

Well done. Thank you George.

PETER DUTTON:

Thank you George. Thanks very much mate.

RAY HADLEY:

Well there’s what we are talking about. There’s the success story.

PETER DUTTON:

That’s it mate. Why would be allow good people like that, the vast majority like that,  to be besmirched by the criminals within a particular community. We need to call  them out and if we do that then at the same time we’re heaping praise on the good  people. That’s been the story of migration.

It doesn’t matter where you come from Ray, I mean if you live in Australia you come  here where you are a part of this society because of the opportunities that afford you,  you want to live in a safe community, you don’t want people bringing their problems  here, take the opportunity of a great education and health system and lead a great  life. That’s what we want. We don’t want people with trouble and we don’t want the  people that are going to cause problems into the future and if we don’t learn from  those mistakes we’ll make them again and we can’t afford that. There’s a lot to  protect in what is a great country.

RAY HADLEY:

Well you think about the contribution that Greek Australians, Greek Italians, Maltese  Australians, Eastern European Australians, Lebanese Australians have made since  before the war in the case of many of these people and after the war…

PETER DUTTON:

…of course.

RAY HADLEY:

I mean it is unbelievable and what I’ve said - and I’ll leave it this way - you want to  go to the markets, the fruit and veg markets in Brisbane or the ones in Sydney and  see the potpourri of people working together where every Vietnamese Australian is  called Johnny, every Greek Australian is called George and they take shots of each  other all morning, they work together, they have a great respect for each other and if  you want to look at multiculturalism working then go to one of those workplaces or go  to the fish markets across the road from where I am at the moment where you see  people from Asian extraction, Greek, Italians, all working, all working together as  Australians.

PETER DUTTON:

That’s dead right Ray and you know the other thing that they all have in common, as  do millions of other Australians, is that they want an honest discussion and I think  from their political leaders they want people to discard the politically correct  nonsense language that Shorten and others carry on with. Let’s deal with issues  carefully, responsibly, but honestly and have the debate. If we have the debate then  we fix these problems, we don’t see them get worse overtime.

We can address the concerns that we’ve got and that way we make our country a  great place today, but with an even greater future and that’s what we want for our  kids and grandkids - that doesn’t matter where you’ve come from, that is ultimately  what you want - you want a safe place, safe environment for your family where you  can work hard and get ahead. And from my perspective, I mean that is why I am in  public life and why I am in this job and I enjoy it, but you have to make tough  decisions.

I mean we can’t allow people to come here who have criminal backgrounds or if they  commit crimes here, they can expect to have their visas cancelled and that’s the  reality of how we should run the programme.

RAY HADLEY:

Now look I’ve run out of time. I want to devote next week’s chat to trucking and 457  visa holders. It will take up our whole time and I’ll get my staff to brief your staff on  exactly where we are heading with this, but we are having far too many accidents  and the RMS are telling me in New South Wales and the main roads in Queensland  are saying, ‘oh no, we don’t give these people licence unless they can drive.’ Day  after day after day I’ve got people coming from other parts of the world to drive B-Doubles who can’t drive it forward let along backwards and we need to talk about it.

PETER DUTTON:

Happy to. Thanks Ray.
