PRIME MINISTER'S ADDRESS TO THE  NATIONAL PRESS CLUB,  WASHINGTON  D.C., THURSDAY,  8 MAY 1975

The following is the text of the Prime Minister's  address to the National Press Club at Washington,  D.C.,  on  Thursday,  8 May 1975, The Prime Minister's replies to  questions from the National Press Club are included at  the fend of the speech.

"PARTNERSHIP IN THE PACIFIC AFTER VIETNAM"

It is not quite two years since I last had the honour  of addressing this National Press Club. In that time,  as  practitioners of our respective professions,  we have all had  to cope with tremendous events and tremendous changes occurring  with unexampled speed. It was therefore with some little

trepidation that I retrieved the remarks I last made to you  to see how they stood the test of time. I find, however, that  the very first point I made has been amply confirmed in a way Ã¢ÂÂ  few of us could have guessed in July 1973. I said then that I  was honoured to address representatives of the world's greatest

and most free press in the world's greatest and most free  democracy,  and that the strength of each was the strength of  both. If this democracy had been less free the constitutional  upheaval of 1974 would not have occurred. If this democracy  had been less strong it could scarcely have survived so

traumatic an encounter. So in accepting your invitation for  a second time,  I again pay tributed to the manifest and enduring  strength of the democracy of the United States,  of which the  press is so fundamental a part.

In the wake of the remarkable events in Indo-China,   all of us - leaders in my calling, commentators in yours - are  in process of reassessing basic policies and relations. For  the United States in particular,  this is bound to be a  difficult and perhaps a painful process. In that reappraisal  the last thing the Government or people of the United States  need are sermons and homilies from foreigners. Certainly, you  don't need them from an Australian. It is true that I happen  to lead a political party which strongly opposed the intervention

in Indo-China: It is also true that I am the Prime Minister of v a nation which for many years supported the intervention and  encouraged the escalation of the war. Whatever recriminations  we might have at home,  it is no role for an Australian Prime

Minister to lecture the United States.

ÃÂ  ,  '

It is,  however,  very necessary that we should prevent  the creation of new myths about what went wrong. And to do that  it is necessary to look at past mistakes - mistakes in which  both countries shared. The great danger is that in an

atmosphere of deep emotion and recrimination engendered by the  suddenness of events in Indo-China,  we should fasten upon  explanations and self-justifications and over-simplifications  which would ensure a return to, a repetition of, the great  mistakes of the past. We have,  in particular,  to resist the

same sort of myths which developed after the revolution in  China. Those myths,  those distortions of reality, perverted  our relations with China for more than a generation. They led  directly to the debacle in Indo-China.

We should have no truck with any new variation of the  "stab in the back" theory - that the war in Vietnam was l$>st  not in Saigon but here in Washington. The truth is that the  United States did not "lose" Vietnam, anymore than she "lost"  China.* Vietnam was not America's to lose. What was defeated  was not the United States and her allies but a policy of

foreign intervention which was bound to fail. There was no  time in the past thirty years when such a policy could have  succeeded. The tragedy for us all, but above all for the  people of Indo-China, is that a policy so manifestly doomed

from the beginning should have been carried through for so  long.

- 2 -

It was never true that the honour and prestige of  the United States and her allies were bound up with the  survival of the Saigon regime,  any more than it was ever  true that the honour,  or prestige, or security of the  United States were bound up with the fate of Generalissimo  Chiang Kai-Shek.

When I spoke to you last I spoke of the "Second  Opportunity" we had gained because of the moves towards  reconciliation with China and with the signing of the Paris  Agreement in January 1973. I said: "For twenty years

I have been appalled at the damage we of the west have done  to ourselves and to other peoples by our western ideological  pre-occupations, particularly in South East Asia. We are  not going to be readily forgiven for throwing away the chance  we had for a settlement in Indo-China in 1954 after Korea,

after Geneva. We have now been given a second chance. ÃÂÃÂÂ§  must not be thrown away." Unfortunately my hopes,  the hopes  of the world, were not fulfilled after January 1973. The  gross breaches of the Paris Agreements by both sides - -political breaches, military breaches - made it inevitable

that the final settlement in Indo-China would be reached by  the arbitrament of war.

Yet in the wider sense that second opportunity,  that second chance of which I spoke, still remains, the  question now is: What are to be our relations and our conduct towards Vietnam - whether there be one Government  of Vietnam or two? Are we to treat Vietnam after 1975 as  we treated China after 1949? Through fear or frustration,

..../3

because of our failure to impose the will of the west on IndoÂ­ china, are we to treat Vietnam as the new pariah, the new  untouchable among nations? No one supposes that it is going  to be a simple or easy task to establish meaningful relations  with Vietnam, a Vietnam emerging from thirty years of civil  war prolonged and deepened by foreign intervention. It is

going to be one of the most difficult tasks for statesmanship,  for the countries in Australia's region and for the United  States.

Two hundred years ago - on 22 March 1775 - Edmund Burke  said: "Magnanimity in politics is not seldom the truest  wisdom". It was his great speech on conciliation with the  American colonies. He was advising another mighty nation  which was about to suffer humiliation at the hands of another

small band of revolutionaries - not because that nation was  wicked or weak but because it was committed to policies doomed  to fail. Magnanimity in the face of failure is much more  difficult than magnanimity in victory. The present  prosperity of Western Germany and Japan attests America's

unparalleled magnanimity in victory. The other, more  difficult, response lies ahead - in Indo-China.

| This is very much a time for a realistic assessment of our strengths and opportunities - and for a good deal of  confidence in those strengths and opportunities. There are  those who feel that because American policy suffered a defeat

in Vietnam, we should be pessimistic about American policy  elsewhere,  and ignore American achievements elsewhere. Dangerous and difficult as the Middle East problem undoubtedly  is, taxing as it is for western statesmanship,  it should not  blind us to the wider stability and security achieved in the  world during the past two decades. Who would deny that the  world is a safer place today than it was in the aftermath of  World War II? Who would deny remembering Berlin, remembering

Greece, remembering Korea, remembering Cuba - that the threats  to peace today are less menacing than those posed by the  critical flashpoints and monolithic confrontations of a  decade or a generation ago? I hope we shall keep a sense  of perspective and reality in these matters, keeping in  mind the real progress we have made towards a safer world,

and not allow ourselves to be panicked or dismayed by  lesser problems than those we have surmounted before.

In the specific matter of Vietnam, I am not going  to be panicked by an outcome achieved militarily in 1975  which might have come about politically in 1954. I am  intent upon reaching a modus vivendi - a meaningful,

constructive relationship - with Vietnam in 1975, as we  would assuredly have had to do some time between 1954 and  1975, and as with such needless and damaging delay we have  donp with China.

It is not,  however, by focussing exclusively upon  Vietnam or even upon Indo-China that we can get the true  perspective of our real strengths and opportunities in the  region - Australia's opportunities, or America's strengths.

There can be no suggestion of wanting to shrug off"the events  in Indo-China. On the contrary there are great lessons to be  learnt. Nonetheless, let's coolly assess both the present  and the future.

If we look at the Pacific Basin area what do we  find? The most developed and some of the strongest of the  dozen or so most significant nations upon or around the four  pacific continents of Asia, Australia, North America and

South America, are flourishing democracies. The United  States' most important friends in this vast area, countries  like Canada, Mexico, New Zealand, Australia and above all,  Japan, have never been stronger - stronger in themselves,

stronger in their basic friendship towards the United States.  The Asean nations - Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand,Ã¢ÂÂ  >   Malaysia, Singapore - are working closely and successfully  together to promote their common interests in a natural

and viable regional grouping. These countries happen to be  those cast by the theorists in the role of the dominoes. Not one of them will give any thanks for being cast in such  a role. Each of them will work in its own way to accommodate

itself to the new political realities in South East Asia. Each recognises that it is primarily its own internal  strength and resilience which will safeguard it against  external threats. Each recognises that the prime guarantee  of national integrity and security lies in developing the

forms of Government best suited to itself and ensuring that  Government is in tune with national needs and popular  aspirations.

There is a further cause for confidence, on the  pacific side of the Asian region, Malaysia, Singapore/ New  Zealand, Australia, Fiji, Western Samoa and Tonga, and on  the Indian Ocean side, India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh,

are all members of the Commonwealth of Nations. I have  been meeting their leaders in Jamaica this week. In this  remarkable association of nations not one head of government  is communist, yet not one head of government was plunged

into despair because of the events in Indo-China. In our  communique issued on Tuesday the nations of the Commonwealth  34 of them said this: "Heads of Government welcomed the end of the prolonged conflict, in Indo-China, urged countries  in a position to do so to contribute to international y

assistance for the urgent tasks of rehabilitation and ÃÂ  reconstruction and looked forward to the new government of  the region playing their full part in the community of  nations." No panic here, no desperation. Yet, as I point  out,  many nations of the Commonwealth are the very nations  who are supposed to be the likely victims of the falling

dominoes. The truth is that all of us have great problems  of one kind or another. Yet each of us is basically confident  of surmounting those problems in our own way. Nor was there  throughoutÂ·our meeting in Jamaica any disposition to knock

the United States,  to recriminate against her or to suggest  that the United States will not be a good ally or a  trustworthy friend. Indeed, with the war in Vietnam over,  many nations - and Australia is one - will have even greater

.  e . . /5

5 L t

confidence in America as an ally,  for we know that American  resolve, American capacity, American resources will no  longer |be weakened or dissipated in a fruitless cause.

President Ford was entirely justified in remarking  two weeks ago, that because the United States', policy had  not succeeded everywhere it should not be assumed it had  succeeded nowhere. The policy failed in Indo-China  because it was foredoomed to failure, the policy succeeded in

Japan and in Europe because it had the necessary ingredients  of success - a realistic appreciation of America's own  interests and the interests of the people of Japan and  Western Europe. It failed in Indo-China because the policy

there was based neither on America's true interests nor on  anything that was possible or relevant as far as the  interests or aspirations of the peoples of Indo-China  were concerned. But the great aims of American policy can

now continue undiminished and undeterred, free of the  impediments and distractions and distortions of Indo-China.

The great thrust of that policy rests upon the  detente with the Soviet Union and with associating China  in a wider detente. Nothing that has happened in IndoÂ­ China would warrant the United States being deflected from  that great goal. For the essential meaning of detente is

simply the prevention of world war, or world nuclear war. It is precisely because this is the highest risk that  mankind has ever faced - the destruction of civilisation (

itself - that this is the highest goal a nation could ever  set for itself.

I ' I view with concern and contempt efforts made by some in countries like Australia and the United States to downgrade or denigrate the efforts being made towards y  detente. No one asserts that the present partial detente really solves the great question of preserving world peace.But to go back now, to retreat from the agreements and undertakings already reached, however slight, however tentative, is to retreat towards ultimate disaster. I do not assert that detente as it now exists is complete. But I do assert that it must be made complete if any of us are to survive. We can begin by ensuring that regions of the world still largely untouched by great power rivalry continue to remain free of it. In that connection, Australia has lent her voice to the maintenance of a zone of peace in the Indian Ocean. All of us who support such proposals, all of us who support detente, know that the difficulties in the way of achieving detente are daunting indeed. But certainly, upon our success or failure turns the future of mankind. And it is because of this that the United States remains the true leader of the world and, as much as she used to be, "the last, best hope of the world". For it is to the United States that the west chiefly looks for meaningful leadership in that direction. If detente is to succeed, it will continue to require American initiatives,  American courage, American leadership.

For many years to come, people like us, Americans,   Australians, politicians, journalists, will be examined in  arguments, in articles, in speeches,  in books what happened  in Indo-China. This is as it should be. For so great a

disaster,  so great a mistake,  such great suffering, cannot  be easily dismissed or even forgotten. We shall all have  to live with it for the rest of our lives. Yet even so,  we have to go on to the future. In the two years since I

last spoke to you America has undergone a vast domestic,  as well as a vast international, catharsis. With those  profound traumas behind you,  with their bitterness and  misery being purged away, what better time to profit by  experience and build on the true strengths of American  democracy and American idealism? Here is an opportunity  - not just for America but for all of us - to end our long  preoccupation with military alignments in Asia,  our

ideological confrontations, our cold war hangups, and open  a new chapter in western co-operation. Let the deeper  issues of poverty, overpopulation and mal-distribution of  the world's wealth assume their proper importance in our  hearts and minds. These are the real problems of the  world. These,  I trust, will be the real concerns of the  United States. With your great tradition of moral leadership,  your unexampled generosity, your vision, your energy,  your

sheer zest* for accomplishment you will find new inspiration in  this task, a task in which Australia will be ready and a willing  QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS; partner.

Mr William Broom, President,  National Press Club:  Our first question,  Mr Prime Minister. We want to know1   about your talks with our President Ford. Did you discuss  with President Ford a program for Vietnamese reconstruction?

From your talks with congressional leaders in our congress,   did you detect strong unwillingness to fund Vietnamese  reconstruction?

Prime Minister: I think it would have been  gracious to add that also at the top table among the  expatriates and the visitors and the authors is the  Deputy Secretary of State and Deputy Assistant Secretary  of State for the part of the region from which I come.

There was some exchange of views between the  President and me on these subjects but not lengthy ones. I can appreciate the difficulties there are at this stage  in asking the American people to accept greater financial  burdens in reconstructing and rehabilitating Vietnam. I  I stated the Australian Government1s attitude - that was  my business - and I said that in the Australian Government's  budget for the financial year which ends this June there  had been provision made for reconstruction and rehabilitation

in both South and North Vietnam and that I had no doubt there  would be provision in the budget which we will be bringing  in in August to continue, and in fact to increase, that  provision, and preferably we would want reconstruction and

rehabilitation to take place through international  organisations. Where they have been available, the ____ /7

7

Australian Government has made contributions to them, not  only in the budget but again in the last two months.

Mr Broom: In what way can Australia and the United States best help in reconstruction and rehabilitation in  Vietnam?

Prime Minister: Well, I believe in all these matters one has to consider what are the views of the people of the  country itself and preferably, as I said earlier, these  should be ascertained through national organisations. There may well be some reluctance, some hesitation, some

inhibitions,  in the new Government in South Vietnam, or  the Government in North Vietnam, or the Government in  Cambodia, having relations with the Australian Government,  for that matter, or with many other Governments..  But

through international bodies, one would hope that there  could be some such consultation. The areas where we have  found in Australia that it was easiest to make arrangements  for rehabilitation was in things like water supplies,  hospital  facilities and public facilities of that character,  that is  material things which were lacking to a very great extent and

in fact had been very largely destroyed. These are things  which are of a non-ideological character. They are obviously  needed and there are obviously matters in these fields  where developed countries, like Australia and the United

States,  can and I believe should assist.

Mr Broom: We have about seven or eight questions all asking in different words the same questioni Many in our  audience wonder what Australia8  s policy will be towards  Vietnamese refugees. Will Australia honour its signature

to the 1951 United Nations Refugee Treaty and admit them?

Prime Minister: And also to the 1967 protocol. We have already,  some days ago,  approached the United Nations High  Commissioner for Refugees to suggest that he should coordinate  an international program to re-settle those Vietnamese who have

fled from their country. It is somewhat unfortunate that in the  region itself there are very few countries which have signed  the 151 convention and the 867 protocol. They include Australia  and New Zealand and Fiji, Canada,  some countries which still  have colonial responsibilities in the area, like Britain and

France, and I don't believe such significant countries as the  Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand or Japan.

Mr Broom: Another question: We wonder how you assess future policies in South Asia and South East Asia of the  communist powers, the Soviet Union, China and the new  communist states of Indo-China. Do you foresee any  attempt to exploit the current power vacuum in that region  and do you see any dangers ahead?

Prime Minister: I am not quite sure what is intended by a power vacuum. What has changed,  I suppose, is that  over the last two years or more there has been a withdrawal or  expulsion of American power on the mainland. American power,

of course, in the air and on the sea is immense.,  the greatest in  the world and mobile. But I believe that in using the word

. . - . /8

8

"communist" we have to realise that there is no monolithic  ideology or action by governments which are totally communist  or predominantly communist. We have realised for the last  fifteen years that the Soviet Union and the People's Republic  of China,  while both competing for the crown of being Orthodox  communist governments,  would be in very great disagreement on  the ccmmunist ideology or the action which it entails or  requires. Now, by the same token, I have no less doubt that  the principal occupation of any communist government around  the world,  like any other government around the world, is and  must be what it conceives to be the interests of its nation,

its own nation. That is, a communist government does not  cease to be a nationally oriented government.  That is  clearly the intention, the practice of the Soviet Government,  of the Government of the People1s Republic of China,  and I  would guess that it will be the attitude of the new Cambodian

Government and of the Government or Governments in Vietnam. It would be, I should imagine, completely unlikely that they  would all concert some program in the region. They will be  looking after what each of them concedes to be the interests

of its own nation. And the Vietnamese Government, or  Governments, will have their time very fully occupied in  reconstruction, rehabilitation and quite probably reconciliation.

Mr Broom: President Ford, earlier this week, proclaimed that the United States would reaffirm closer ties with the  anti-communist governments of South Korea and Taiwan. Is  building an anti-communist alliance a viable policy in the

light of recent changes in Asia?

Prime Minister: As I understand the President as having  said, and if I understand his attitude after our conversation  yesterday, he has resolved to fulfil the obligations of his  nation which it has undertaken to other nations,  and of course

the United States has undertaken obligations,  bilateral  obligations,  to each of the political entities that the  questioner mentions. It is not forming any new association  or alliance. It is honouring continuing obligations.

Mr Broom: Your country was the first to recognise the Khmer Rouge Government after the fall of Phnom Penh. Will  you protest the atrocities of the new government which are  being revealed today?

Prime Minister: We were not the first to recognise the  new Government in Phnom Penh. We were prompt in acknowledging  it, but quite obviously, to take one example that should be in  the minds of everyone, the French Government acted quite some  time before the Australian Government. We do not have any  representatives at the moment in Phnom Penh - there are some Â·   difficulties of communication with Phnom Penh or with the  Head of State, who is still resident in Peking. I have no  knowledge, therefore, officially or in any way directly -

there are no Australian correspondents either in Phnom Penh -  as to what ip going on there. If there is any evidence which  comes to us directly, of course we will protest. That is, in  the event of any atrocities, of course we will protest about them.

..../9

We have done that in all the countries it has occurred to our  knowledge since we came into office. '

Mr Eiroom: Just one more question on events in your part  of the world. How do you believe the question of a nuclear  free zone for the Pacific wJLll be resolved, keeping in mind  that only one of the Anzus partners,  New Zealand, supports it?

Prime Minister: I understand that the proposal for a nuclear free zone in the Pacific, that is an extension  westward of the Treaty of Tlatelolco, might be proposed by  New Zealand for the Agenda of this year's United Nations.

It might come up in the form of discussing”the proposal. Now all I would say, my own government's attitude, is that  we place priority on achieving treaties in the nuclear  field to which the nuclear power will subscribe. That is,  we believe the first obligation for the nations is to

secure the support of the United States, the Soviet Union,   Britain, China, France, to these various treaties. And  we have done what we can to persuade other nations to sign  and to ratify such treaties, in particular,  I suppose,

the nuclear non proliferation treaty. When my Government  came in, it very promptly ratified that treaty and it was  encouraging to us that about a week ago West Germany and . Italy and the three Benelux countries also signed it as  well. We would hope that Japan will do so. We are

disappointed that Indonesia has not done so and that India  has not done so, but this is the priority that my Government  fixes in matters of disarmament. We want treaties of  restraint to which the nuclear powers will subscribe.

Mr Broom: Now that the United States Congress has - approved indemnity,  will you approve the use of Australia's  ports by United States nuclear warships?

Prime Minister: The use of Australian ports by. nuclear powered naval vessels was suspended by the previous  Australian Government.  It applied to United States and  British naval vessels. It has been considered quite recently

again and, in particular, in the light of the fact that the  Congress has now approved in effect a total indemnity against  any adverse effects of the operation of nuclear powered  vessels in Australian waters., in any host country. There .

is another matter which I imagine will next be considered  in Australia and that is the environmental aspects which  are very largely a responsibility of the State Governments  in Australia. We adopted a federal system from the United  States, we imposed it on a British parliamentary system, but

it is in a more rudimentary form. So therefore,  while in  .  the United States you are used to the co-mingling of powers,  so that if any area, such as a port, there are state

responsibilities and federal responsibilities,  the federal  ones prevail. In Australia, this is not yet so clear. It

.  .  ... Â· ' Ã¢ÂÂ   ’  .... /10 .  .

10

is a point of view which I would very much support myself. The Australian naval ports all happen to be very considerable  maritime centres. The biggest naval base in Australia, for  instance is in the harbour of Sydney,  and obviously the State

Government would have to be concerned there because the  safeguard arrangements are in the hands of the State  authorities.

Mr Broom: We have a lot of questions about your country. How things are going there, you know it is a long -   way away from us and not too many, of us get there. One  person wants to know how is the Opera Hotise doing. Do you  have any more architecture of that sort hoing up?

Prime Minister: Fabulously. I hope so.

Mr Broom: And what are Australia's plans for  developing a uranium enrichment industry?

Prime Minister: Australia does not have the  knowhow nor,  I guess,  the capital to develop a uranium  enrichment industry. We have undertaken jointly with Japan  a feasibility study to see whether we can get the capital

and knowhow to establish such an industry. We have some  preliminary negotiations in this respect with the competing  European systems,  the one developed by West Germany,  the  Netherlands and Britain,  and the other one being developed  by France and Italy, and I think Iran is involved in that

also. You might not all realise that Australia seems to  have about one-fifth of the known reserves of uranium in  the, shall I say, the west.Â·

Mr Broom: Do you think that might give an OPEC type power to Australia in the nuclear age? "

Prime Minister: If consumers are reasonable,  no. Let's face it, the consumers so exploited the employee class  and the colonial economies that they provoked organised  retaliation. What my country prefers is arrangements between  producers and consumers. In respect to renewable resources,

crops, we have followed that policy for decades. We would  still like to follow it. We regret that other countries no  longer seem to wish to do so. In respect of non renewable  resources,  minerals,  then Australia has been driven into  the situation of considering her interests in association  with other countries which have similar interests and those

associations in which the Australian Government participated,  or in which it is contemplating participating, have in  general been accepted as reasonable by countries, "administrations,   like the United States.

Mr Broom: Several questions about food, of which your country is a great producer. What are your views on  world grain stockpiling to prevent a shortage? Do you fear  retaliation from world beef importers or exporters because  of Australia's beef sales during this time of surplus? What

are you doing and what will you do to aid your ailing livestock'  industry? o/ll

11

Prime Minister: Well,  we wish that we could make more beef sales, and I hope you won’t think it begrudging of  me if I say that the United States has somewhat disappointed  us in this respect. I won't say surprised, I will say

disappointed. Australia is one of the few countries which  exports beef. There are very few. After all, most of the  world's population doesn't eat meat. Very few countries  indeed can afford to import meat and those that can are

those with which Australia has many associations, Western  Europe, Japan and the United States, and Australia has  supplied all three of those markets. Last year, Japan,  without any warning, stopped buying meat. The European  Economic Community without any warning stopped buying  meat and American reduced purchases of meat, and that of

course very greatly harmed our meat industry, our cattle  industry. We have certain advantages of area and climate  which make for economies in meat productions. In those  circumstances, we resent the fact that the few customers

that there are in the world, the ones upon which we felt  we were entitled to depend, completely (most of them) cut  off purchases of meat from Australia. In those circumstances,   it is not surprising there has been a very great depression

in some areas in Australia and I believe that consumers ought  to bear this in mind. If they want cheap meat, regular  supplies of it, they must be regular purchasers because

it obviously takes some time to produce beasts to the  stage where they are to be killed and so on. Now, as  regards wheat and other grains, Australia is one of the  few countries which produces a surplus. Canada and the  United States would be the other significant ones.’  By  contrast to meat, wheat and grains in general are things

that everybody in the world consumes and always have and  it is easily transported and easily stored and wherever  there is a drought or a natural disaster in the world the  thing which is easiest to provide to alleviate it is wheat  or other grains. We now find in Australia, and no doubt  Canada and the United States find it as well, that the  developing countries, those that have a population increasing  more rapidly than resources, that they are very happy for us

to provide wheat on favourable terms, credit terms, and so  on, which in effect means gifts. Now other developed  countries,  ones which do not have the productivity of the  United States and Canada and Australia, are very happy to  provide favourable credit terms to developing countries

for the purchase of manufactured goods. Developing countries  do not need them and do not even want them. -  But we can  never seem to come to some arrangement where developed

countries, such as West Germany or Japan, who can well  afford to help alleviate the conditions in developing  countries or to overcome natural disasters, they don't  seem very keen to provide credit to the United States or  to Canada, or Australia, to provide their surplus stocks. I should point out that, while Australia is a developed  country in the normal context of its economic pattern, its  production, its investment, its employment is overwhelmingly

in the manufacturing field, secondary industry, yet our  overseas trade is still in the.pattern of our neighbours  or of other developing countries. We depend on the income  we get for non-renewable assets like minerals or renewable

.Ã¢ÂÂ ../12

- 12 -

assets like crops,  or to a certain extent meat,  and in those  circumstances we just cannot afford to be unilaterally  benevolent to the rest of the world. Developed countries  ought to get together more in this respect. Australia has  had a very bad deal from Western Europe and Japan. It has

not had too good a deal from the United States as regards  meat and, similarly,  here we can ally ourselves with the .   United States- The rest of the developed world does not  make it easy for us to use our agricultural productivity

for the. benefit of people who suffer natural disasters or  whose human rate of increase is outpacing the rate of  increase of their resources.

Mr Broom: To carry that discussion just one step further,  is there any prospect of an Australia/New  Zealand/Canada/United States common market?

Prime Minister: Very little I would think.

I don't believe that this is really what is  needed in the Pacific. Inevitably any such common market  would be regarded as being for the benefit of the manufacturÂ­ ing countries and would be regarded as being to the disÂ­

advantage ,  certainly being no advantage to the developing  ones. What we have to realise is two things. That is  developing countries want to see that the price they get  for their exports keeps pace with the price they have to  pay for their imports and secondly,  that there is a steady

increase in the processing of their commodities within  their own shores. After all,  we all know that the  developed countries,  the manufacturing countries,  are  prosperous,  not just because of the commodities they  produce but because of the processing they apply to those

commodities. Now the prosperity of developing countries  is adversely affected by the fact that they can't depend  on the price they get for their commodities and they find  it extraordinarily difficult to get the capital,  the  knowhow,  to process a fair proportion of those commodities

themselves. And the Pacific, with the exception of the  countries you mentioned,  is very much a developing area. And the proper way to keep them happy is to make it plain  to them, so that it is visible and palpable to their  populations,  that conditions are getting better and

during their lifetimes they will be getting better still. And that is not achieved,  I suggest, by just having another  rich man’s club in the Pacific. That is having a Common  Marketo That is how it would be regarded. For Australia  ~and~NÂ§w' Zealand", Canada and the' United-  States, '  add' in "

Japan .if you like, were to form a Common Market,  then  there is no doubt that the rest of the Pacific would  think that we were out to take advantage of them. And  also I would have to be quite plain with you. There are  a very great number of people in Australia, and still  more in New Zealand, who would think that such a

Common Market was to the advantage of those companies  which are domiciled in the United States.

Mr Broom: What has been Australia's experience with the TFX or Fill fighter airplane. Did you approve  the purchase of that plane? ,

Prime Minister: We are taking good care of them and Australia has the most formidable air force for thousands  of miles around. There is nobody who could approach  Australia with hostile intent by sea or air. My party when

in opposition was extremely dubious about the acquisition of  the Fill, the TFX, and there was good reason for. it. because  we found out that a contract had been made without lawyers  advice on our part. Whatever you say about lawyers, it is

at least prudent to have their advice when you are signing  a contract for some hundreds of millions of dollars and our  predecessors did not take that elementary precaution. The  Prime Minister s at the time were all lawyers but they left it

to people in the Department of Defence, including a Minister  who had been a pharmacist,  to sign the contract. Well,  there happened to be some flaws in the contract and it took  about ten years to get the aircraft. I suppose one would  have doubts whether it was necessary to have such

sophisticated aircraft in our part of the world. It would  seem that it is disproportionately technical but nevertheÂ­  less I have no doubt whatever that it is a very effective  aircraft and while it seems to be more than we. need to  cope with nobody who is ever .likely to approach Australia,  yet by the same token, there is no doubt that nobody could

afford to approach Australia with hostile intent.

Mr Broom: What sort of retaliation does your Government plan towards the United States if Harry Hopman  becomes the non-playing captain of the American Davis  Cup Team.

Prime Minister: This is a sore point that you  should bring along the most distinguished of Australian  expatriates to your hospitable board with me here. We  know that Hopman is the best in the world and we don't  mind sharing our best with the"United States.

STATEMENT BY THEPRIiiE MINISTER, THE HON ÃÂ '  E . Cr. \ÃÂ½'ÃÂÃÂÃÂ¤ÃÂ.Â·ÃÂ¹ÃÂÂ·ÃÂ¯, v . C . , M.E. ,  ON HIS RETURN EROr: CHOGH 1975  CANBERRA, 11 MAY 1975

My overseasvTsii"achieved threepurposese I was able to take

part in important- discussions at the Commonwealth Heads of GovernÂ­

ment meeting, to renew my personal contacts with President Ford, '

and by visiting Peru, to establish for the first time close -links between Australia and a South American countryÂ» .

There can be no doubt of the Commonwealth's growing

importance as an international forum. Its members represent

a quarter of the world's peopleÂ» The talks in Jamaica werei

the most productive and harmonious Commonwealth conference ever

held. There was a remarkable identity of views on many of the

world's problems, including the need for positive steps to redress

the imbalance between rich and poor nations.

In Washington I had cordial and frank talks with President  *]%*** cJt

Ford and other American leaders. I to era k a r rtÂ·  fi'oni . the ready

expressions of good will towards Australia, and assurances of

America's continuing commitment to her allies in our region.

Australia's relations with the U.S. have never been healthierÂ» '

Our understanding has never been closer or more soundly based.

‘  I expect in the next few days to report fully on my visit

in a national broadcast.
