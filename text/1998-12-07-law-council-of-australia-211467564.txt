Immigration Minister's Comments 
"Appalling', Says Law Council

Â

The Law Council of Australia 
says it is appalled by comments made by the Federal Minister for Immigration 
and Multicuitural Affair  s, the Hon. Philip Ruddock MP, regarding the way 
in which Federal Court judges are deciding migration cases coming before 
them.

Â

In a speech to the House of Representatives, Mr Ruddock accused some 
Federal Court judges of going on a "frolic of their own" in 
interpreting laws regarding migration cases, when the High Court has 
given the Federal Court "some guidance in these matters".

Â

Mr Ruddock also suggested that some Federal Court judges are using 
error of law to reintroduce merits review of migration matters, rather 
than using Federal Court hearings to simply find whether lower tribunals 
have properly applied the law.

Â

The extraordinary comments made by Mr Ruddock were made in the context 
of the Federal Government introducing its Migration Legislation Amendment 
(Judicial Review) Bill 1998, which limits judicial review of immigration-related 
decisions.

Â

"This is an appalling attack on the Federal Court, and on Australian 
judges who are simply doing their job in interpreting Australian law 
against cases coming before them" says the President of the Law 
Council, Mr Fabian Dixon.

Â

In interpreting such cases under the Rule of Law, and under the relevant 
Australian laws, the judges are acting responsibly in ensuring that 
justice is being delivered for those migrants and asylum seekers coming 
before them.

Â

If the decisions the judges are making are not welcomed by the Federal 
Government, then the Government itself should act responsibly and appeal 
the decisions, rather than publicly attack Federal Court judges because 
they have simply undertaken their judicial responsibilities.

Â

It appears that the Government is attempting to limit access to the 
courts for migration matters, because it doesn't like the decisions 
being handed down in accordance with the law.

Â

“Mr Ruddock should also keep in mind Australia's international human 
rights obligations when attempting to limit judicial review of migration 
matters.

Â

It is questionable as to whether the Federal Government's proposed 
amendments to limit the judicial review of migration cases comply with 
international treaties.

Â

"For example, Article 16(1) of the United Nations Convention 
Relating to the Status of Refugees states that 'A refugee shall have 
free access to the courts of law on the territory of all Contracting 
States.'

Â

"Similarly, Article 7 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 
states that 'All are equal before the law, and are entitled without 
any discrimination to equal protection of the law.'

Â

"The Law Council remains very concerned at the Federal Government's 
policy in migration matters, which seeks effectively to limit access 
to justice for migrants and asylum seekers. The Council urges all non-Government 
Senators to oppose the Government's Bill."

Mr Fabian Dixon, is available for interview on (03) 6235 9311 bh, (03)
