Leader of the Opposition

TRANSCRIPT OF

DOORSTOP INTERVIEW WITH DR JOHN HEWSON, HP  SYDNEY, TUESDAY 17 JULY 1990

B 6 EO PROOF COPY ONLY

HEWSONi

In view of the continuing rumours about the stability of  various financial institutions in Australia, and I don't  want to make a comment on any particular financial

institution, but there is a very urgent need for the

Government to initiate a process whereby we get an effective  national approach to prudential supervision in this country.

It will, by necessity, as it will involve the States, have  to be an integrated approach, but as a matter of urgency it  must be given highest priority that they develop an

effective national approach to the prudential supervision  of financial institutions.

JOURNALIST!

How would you see that being done? ‘

HEWSON:

Well, we've had unfortunately a air of unreality about the  nature of prudential supervision over recent years.  It is  a divided responsibility now with the states responsible for  the supervision of some institutions and, of course, the  Reserve Bank responsible for the supervision of others.

What you've got to do is put it together, recognise that as  an essential feature of the deregulation and development of  the financial system is to develop an effective procedure  for prudential supervision, and that should be done as a

matter of urgency. Until it's done, I mean, unfortunately  we won't really know the nature of the intentions of the  government in this respect.

Now, I'm not arguing for re-regulation of the financial  system, you've got to make that clear, but we have to have  '  an integrated national approach to prudential supervision.

2.

Are you saying that the current regulations are just too  lax?

HEWSON:

No, I'm not making a view about the current regulation, I'm  just saying that the responsibility is presently divided,  some of it State, some of it Federal. And there's a lot of  people who are quite unsure as to who's responsible for what

and the extent to which standards have been maintained and  the only way you put all that uncertainty behind us is  actually to develop an integrated national approach to it.

JOURNALIST:

So nobody has an idea of the whole picture.

JOURNALIST:

... Australia, the Liberals in Western Australia, who are  against giving efficient national supervision power to  companies regulations, so are you saying you'd be able to  get all the various Liberals in the States, including the  current West Australian Opposition, to back national

regulation? -

HEWSON:

Well, look, company law is related in a sense, of course,  but at this stage we don't know that Western Australia would  block that legislation. I had a meeting with all the

Liberal Party Leaders from around Australia a few weeks ago,  and we have an agreed position in relation to company law  and, you know, everybody recognises that there are certain  national responsibilities in relation to company law,  clearly there will also be certain national responsibilities

in relation to the prudential supervision of financial  institutions. I don't want to make a, I'm not making a  political comment, I don't want it to be a matter of

politics, its far too important. So we've got to put petty  politics behind us, if you like, and get on and develop and  effective integrated national approach to prudential  supervision.

Would you see the Reserve Bank taking a bigger role in that?

JOURNALIST:

JOURNALIST;

3.

Well, it may be that the Reserve Bank in the end is the body  that has to do it. I don't want to pre-judge that, but it  may be and it may be a role, a bigger role, than they have  foreseen so far, that they would undertake.  But it's

clearly something that's got to be addressed and addressed  as a matter of urgency. And we can't let the situation  drift where people are uncertain about the nature of that  prudential supervision,

JOURNALIST;

Dr Hewson, your comments are obviously in response of what's  been happening in Victoria, who do you actually blame for  the current problems.

HEWSON;

As I say, I don't want to talk about what's happened in  relation to particular institutions, it's an issue that I've  raised a number of times in the past, but prudential

supervision is an essential part of the deregulation of the  financial system.  And there have been various views around  over the time since the early 1980s, as to what should be  supervised and how it should be supervised, and who should  do it. Its about time we actually made some of those

decisions and put, if there is necessary, legislative change  in place to ensure that you get an effective, national  approach to the supervision of financial institutions as a  whole.

JOURNALISTS

...you are talking about taking these regulatory roles away  from the States and giving them to the ...(inaudible)

HEWSON;

Not necessarily, I'm just saying it will necessarily involve  discussions, perhaps co-operation between the Commonwealth  and the States, but the issue is important and its got to  be addressed and if it takes a meeting of Commonwealth and

State leaders as part of that process then that meeting  should take place. I don't want to predetermine any of  that, I'm simply saying that there is an urgent need for it  and we can't pretend that it's not important. It's been an  element of the deregulatory process which has not been  adequately addressed so far and it's just got to be

addressed.

HEWSON:

4.

Dr Hewson, in the meantime, what would you advise people to  do who actually have money in property trusts now. Would  you advise them to withdraw it or leave it where it is.

HEWSON:

It is not for me to give that advice.

JOURNALIST:

But you are in a position to do so,

HEWSON:

No, I'm not. I don't have any information about any

institution so all I'm saying is that I'm raising an issue  in a bi-partisan spirit if you like, to ensure that we get  genuine progress on what is a very important issue.

JOURNALIST: .

Is there any action that can be taken now to stop the rot  going further in Victoria, to stop things getting worse.

HEWSON:

Look, I don't want to comment on particular...

JOURNALIST:

.. .  (inaudible)...

HEWSON:

... a lot of the financial system support is, of course,  related to confidence, and I think yesterday the Reserve  Bank made a very welcome statement in relation to that  particular institution. I strongly support them making that

sort of statement but I don't want to talk about individual  institutions because I simply don't know.

JOURNALIST:

Right, with the Reserve Bank, are they doing enough to  restore confidence.

HEWSON:

I don't know what the Reserve Bank is doing either.

Yesterday they made a statement, I've welcomed that  statement, but beyond that I've had no briefing from the  Reserve Bank. I just say that it is a matter of urgency  that there be a national approach.

JOURNALIST:

5.

Do you think the current problems would have actually arisen  had the safeguards you are calling for actually been  implemented some time ago.

HEWSON:

I don't know that. Look I'm not specifying the details of  prudential standards because there is a lot of literature,  there's a lot of debate about the effective way to do it,  and so on. See the government a few years ago created a  very speculative environment. They gave a very strong,  created a very inflationary environment, they created an

environment in which people were encouraged to go into debt  and a lot of that debt was incurred in the expectation that  asset prices, be they share prices or real estate prices,  residential real estate, or commercial property prices would  keep on going up. People geared up on the expectation of  sustained strength in asset prices.

Recently, of course, with the wall of high interest rates  those asset prices have started to fall, the stock market  fell in 87, subsequently a number of markets have seen  commercial real estate, residential real estate prices fall

and a lot of those past investment decisions have now been  called into question.

And the government is directly responsible for creating that  environment and building that sort of incentive into the  system. We now have a situation where some of that shakeÂ­ out is obviously effected some financial institutions in  Australia, and so we are now at the stage where we

desperately need a national aipproach to the prudential  supervision of all financial institutions.

JOURNALIST:

So the government doesn't know what's going on.

HEWSON:

I don't know what the government knows. I mean they can  tell us what they know if they like. But I don't know what  they know.

Can you, are you saying that the current situation could  have been foreseen, something could have been done to stop  this happening.

JOURNALIST:

JOURNALIST:

6.

;

I don't know in relation to particular institutions, but I  started pointing out early on that a logical consequence of  high interest rates was that asset prices would fall. And

I got quite a bit of stick for it at the time but in fact

it's been a trend. This period of flat activity in

Australia is sort of, is really quite unique in our history.  That is one where it is debt driven, and there's been

something of a collapse in some of our asset markets, and  in those circumstances it's raising problems and having  effects that weren't foreseen in 82-83 when not the same  sort of phenomenon occurred. All I'm saying is that there

is an urgent need to do something about it. You've got to  know what is happening, in the financial system as a whole.  Some body or group of bodies has got to take that

responsibility in the end under the law. It may be the  Reserve Bank, it may be a separate body, it may involve  Commonwealth and State co-operation, but let's address the  issue and get on and do something about it.

JOURNALIST:

Are you expecting the government to respond to you call.

HEWSON:

I hope so.

JOURNALIST: .

But the government might know what's going on.

JOURNALIST:

...(inaudible)... consumption tax. What's your feeling  about that now?

HEWSON:

Well, I mean, we're about to go through a procedure of  considering the issue within our Party. Sure, in New  Zealand there is evidence to suggest that a consumption tax  became much more popular after it was introduced than before

and that is just one element of what will be put before our  Party Room. One piece of information, if you like, as to  what will be put before our Party Room when we ultimately  have that debate. I think the next stage in the process is

a seminar that Peter has organised, and the desire with that  seminar is that we provide people in the Party with the  opportunity to hear from experts, irrespective of their

views, to determine in their own mind the pluses and minuses  of a consumption tax.

HEWSON:

7.

What's your own view. Can you sell consumption tax to the  electorate?

HEWSONs

I'm on the record for years as having advocated a

consumption tax being considered. I put it on the agenda  this time for consideration. I'm not saying that we've yet  decided to do it. I recognise that it may be politically  difficult to sell if we decide to do it. But that is all  part and parcel of the decision. You have to look at it on

its economic merits, you've got to look on it on your

capacity to explain and to sell it and you've got look at  it as part of an integrated package of measures that might  need to be taken to put this country back on the road. Now,  at this stage I haven't made up my mind whether we will come  out in favour of it or we won't. The Party Room processes  have got to be gone through and that debate will be a very

interesting and active one.

JOURNALIST!

...(inaudible)... on the Cambodian issue.

JOURNALISTS

HEWSON:

The secret to this resolution of the refugee problem is the  resolution of the situation in Cambodia. Our government  doesn't recognise a government in Cambodia, or the

government in Cambodia, whichever way you want to put it,  so the question of aid is not appropriate to be asked. We  do support aid going via various international

organisations, for example, like the Red Cross, that may go  to Cambodia. But the fundamental requirement right now is  to settle the Cambodian issue and the government has put a  proposal on the table involving the United Nations,

involving a process of elections, the Opposition has  supported that and we would like to see every effort made  now with a meeting taking place in Paris to persuade the  Chinese that the wisdom, for example of facilitating an  early end to the Cambodian situation by bringing all parties

to the table and by bringing in the end a set of elections.

But your would take a softer approach to the boat people  in Australia.

JOURNALIST!

8.

The boat people have arrived in Australia, claim to be  refugees and they are now, the DORS procedure is now being  applied to determine whether they are or are not genuine  refugees and at this stage all we can say is that procedure  must be adhered to.

If down the track some of those people are screened out, if  there is a conclusion made that they are not genuine

refugees then we have to decide what we do about then.

One is to let them in, one option is to let them in, which  would in time work to debase the integrity of our

immigration system.

A second one is to seek to voluntarily repatriate them to  their country of origin and thirdly the option is

involuntary repatriation. My view is you try the voluntary  route first, if it doesn't work, in the end you may need to  go the involuntary repatriation route as it would be very

important to send a clear signal back to the country from  where they came that you cannot debase our immigration  rules, but if you are a genuine refugee, OK, if you're not  a genuine refugee, if you just seek a better life in

Australia, then you shouldn't make the effort on the boat.  Because if we don't do that, if we don't have a firm set of  rules on this, we might as well put a tour guide up there  on the bnrder with a set of signposts to Australia and

forget about our immigration rules, which nobody will  support.

Thank you.
