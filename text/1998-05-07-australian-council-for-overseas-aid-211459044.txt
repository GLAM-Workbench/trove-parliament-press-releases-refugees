commend latest ACFOA publication on Middle East

Â

Co-sponsors of an Australian Council for Overseas Aid Seminar on humanitarian 
needs in th e Middle East have urged parliamentarians and the 
media to read the latest ACFOA publication. They hope it will add to 
the understanding of the complex humanitarian needs in that region and 
the need for continued direct Australian support for the peace process. 
The release of the report coincides with the 50th anniversary of the 
creation of Israel and since Palestinians have been refugees.

Â

The parliamentarians 
announced ‘We are pleased to support the release of papers presented 
at the ACFOA Seminar   Humanitarian Needs in Middle East Zones of Conflict  held late 
last year. We were pleased to have been able to co-host the seminar 
at Parliament House’.

Â

Support by the international 
community, including Australia, to the peace process between Israelis 
and Palestinians remains essential if we are to see progress towards 
a lasting peace. This ACFOA seminar has helped raise debate on the complex 
humanitarian needs in the region, the gains that will be made for those 
directly involved and for the international community overall if a comprehensive 
peace can be achieved.

Â

Papers are presented 
from a range of eminent persons and we urge parliamentarians, senators, 
the media and the general public to take time to read through the report 
and find out more about this crucial region of enormous significance 
to Australia and Australians.

Â

Additional copies of 
the paper are available from Robyn Gilliland, ACFOA.
