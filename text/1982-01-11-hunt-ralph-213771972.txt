REVIEI l?  OF AUSTRALIA'S FUTURE NEEDS IN CIVIL COASTAL SURVEILLANCE

(Statement by the Minister for Transport, the Hon. Ralph 3. Hunt, MP)

The Minister for Transport Mr Ralph Hunt today announced the measures

which would flow .from the Federal Government's recent review of Australia's

needs in civil coastal surveillance'. Mr Hunt said that experience during the

last three years,  particularly in the light of continued unauthorised landings

and other activities of concern to the Commonwealth, has confirmed the need for

a comprehensive and efficient civil coastal surveillance program at or about

the current level of activity. .

"The program will retain the principal objectives of maximising

protection Â·of our national quarantine interest, and deterring breaches of

Customs, Immigration, Fisheries and other relevant laws", he said.

The Government saw no need to change existing arrangements whereby

RAAF P3 Orion aircraft and RAN patrol boats were used for offshore surveillance

and enforcement. '  '  ,  .  .

"They are performing their task effectively", he said. '

"The progressive introduction of Fremantle Class patrol boats will

provide a significant additional surface capability in civil coastal surveillance

he said.

Mr Hunt said that aerial search remained the only practical way of

providing an effective surveillance capability for Australia's remote northern

coastline.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢  "This aerial search, carried out principally for quarantine purposes,

will continue to be carried out with aircraft and crew provided to the CommonÂ­

wealth under contract", he said. Ã¢ÂÂ

"This;"system has the chief advantage of being able to use the expertise

possessed by Australia's general aviation industry".

Mr Hunt said that the Government has decided that weather radar,

advanced communications and ULF/Omega navigation equipment ought to be fitted

to all aircraft involved in civil coastal surveillance.

"The fitting of radar to all aircraft will significantly improve

surveillance capability and allow the aircraft to carry out their tasks in

almost all weather conditions", he said.

"More versatile radio equipment will allow direct communication between

all ships and aircraft involved in civil coastal surveillance, including military

vehicles.

The fitting of VLF/Omega navigation equipment will allow surveillance

aircraft to give locations of surveillance sightings with greater precision".

Mr Hunt said it had also been decided that all civil coastal surveillance

aircrews should be uniformed and that aircraft be' clearly identifiable in their

surveillance role to maximise their deterrent effect.

"The GovernmentÂ· is also to improve regional involvement in the program

by outposting more officers from the Australian Coastal Surveillance Centre (ACSC)

to provide increased on-the-spot monitoring of operations and personal contact

with people in the north, particularly those in remote areas", he said.

"The ACSC currently has officers permanently based at Darwin and Cairns

and regularly sends officers ‘on field trips to train and instruct surveillance

crews and to increase public involvement in surveillance reporting.

Lie will be aiming to put ACSC officers permanently at locations in

Western Australia as well as boosting numbers in the Northern Territory and

Queensland ".

Mr Hunt said that the main features of the current program were to be

retained. These were:

. daily air searches principally for quarantine purposes of the northern

coastal areas between Karratha and Cairns by twelve civil aircraft on

.  charter to the Commonwealth;

aerial surveillance of the refugee approaches to Daruin by a Nomad

Searchmaster L aircraft on charter td the Commonuealth;

regular aerial surveillance of the Great Barrier Reef by a Nomad

Searchmaster L aircraft on charter to the Commonuealth, but to be

revieued before expiration of the current contact at the end of 1982;

aerial surveillance by RAAF P3 Orion Long Range Maritime Patrol

aircraft to cover the 200 nautical mile Australian fishing zone and

to meet other special requirements;

nine RAN patrol boats directly available for response and enforcement;

three Customs Nomad Searchmaster L aircraft chartered for special

response and the three Customs 3 Class vessels to be available to

civil coastal surveillance uhen required, depending on priorities;

the Australian Coastal Surveillance Centre (ACSC), operated by the

Department of Transport, to continue to coordinate surveillance

activities ; and

the Minister for Transport to continue as Government spokesman on

civil coastal surveillance matters.

"In deciding on the current program the Government has taken into

account the considerations raised by State Governments and the Northern Territory,

industry and others as uell as the recommendations .and vieus of the Australian

Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drugs (Mr Oustice UJilliams, 1980) and the

Senate Standing Committee on National Resources Inquiry into the Adequacy of

Quarantine (1979)", Mr Hunt said.

"The measures announced to further strengthen and continue the civil

coastal surveillance program are based on three years experience uith the

arrangements. .  .

The Government has directed that these new measures be kept under

.  continuous review". . . . .
