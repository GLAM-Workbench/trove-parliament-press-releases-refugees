Immigration network final report was emphatic - time limits and urgent reforms are needed:  Greens

The Joint Select Committee on the Immigration Detention Network was damning in its assessment of  the problems within the system, such as the urgency of time limits on detention, that cannot be  ignored, the Australian Greens said today.

“The Government and Coalition are opposed to time limits and are trying to treat this as business as  usual,” Greens' immigration spokesperson, Sen. Sarah Hanson-Young, said.

“This is just simply impractical and inhumane - and is wasting billions of tax payer dollars.

“Scott Morrison says time limits won’t work, well the experts including doctors with the Australian  Medical Association disagree.

“These experts are also clear that it is urgent the government act now to fix persistent failings within  the detention network, not delay them until September, the date the Immigration Minister says the  government will respond.

“Asylum seekers who are suffering the damage of detention, including 250 people who have been  detained longer than two years, are at breaking point and cannot afford to wait six months.

“The Greens urge the government to immediately act on the recommendations as part of the May  Budget, and start to undo the repeated mistakes the final report says need to be fixed.”
