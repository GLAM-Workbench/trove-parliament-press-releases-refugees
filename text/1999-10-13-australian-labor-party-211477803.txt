Another boat of illegal immigrants -

Another failure for Ruddock and Vanstone on 
border protection

Â

Yesterday’s landing in Western Australia of a boat carrying 116 
illeg al immigrants is further proof that the Government’s attempted 
measures to introduce draconian laws is just a smokescreen given their 
repeated failures on coastal surveillance and border protection, Shadow 
Justice and Customs Minister, Duncan Kerr, said today.

Â

“Mr Ruddock’s smokescreen seems to be an attempt 
to hide the fact that the Government is not properly addressing the 
issue of border protection,” Mr Kerr said.

Â

“Australia has 11 million square kilometres of ocean 
to monitor. But the fact remains - we haven’t got the ‘cop on the 
beat’ with proper resources and proper coordination to do the task 
the Australian public expects.”

Â

Mr Kerr said the Government’s Border Protection 
Legislation Bill is due to be debated in the Parliament next week.

Â

“While this Bill recognises the need for Australia 
to be able to enforce our maritime laws, the Government does not have 
an adequate plan for coastal surveillance,” Mr Kerr said.

Â

“Australia has this year had a record number of 
boat people, with 56 boats carrying 1498 people, compared with 13 boats 
and 157 people in 1997/98.

Â

“When will Mr Ruddock and Senator Vanstone admit 
their policy failings on this issue?

Â

“This landing is exactly the sort of outcome we 
expect from their ad hoc approach to border protection.

Â

“There is no one agency in Australia with overall 
responsibility for our maritime jurisdiction.

Â

“Labor believes the Government has failed to properly 
examine the option of an Australian Coastguard. We need an integrated 
strategy.”
