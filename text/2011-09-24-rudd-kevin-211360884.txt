Thank you very much Valerie Amos and for the good work of the UN Office for the  Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.

This has been called the children’s famine, and out of every 100, 000 young children, 4,000  are dying each month. And if we think about that, what does it mean in practice? It means  that there are therefore 1,000 little ones losing their lives each week. If we think of where  we’ve been in the General Assembly chamber for the opening of the General Debate on  Wednesday of this week, imagine that chamber full of little kids - that’s how many die in a  week, that’s how many would have died in Leaders’ Week.

This becomes more graphic, of course, when you go to the region. It was my privilege to be  there recently with Josette Sheeran, the head of the WFP (World Food Programme), in Dolo,  in Gedo Province, and in Somalia itself. And as you know, it is very difficult to forget the  faces of dying children. These leave a huge impression on you. We saw women and kids who  had been on the road for up to four weeks, having walked literally hundreds of kilometres  through the wilderness. The good news is, once they get there, and I saw this, and I’ve seen  the after effects as well, you see little lives saved through the provision of emergency packs  of nutrition through UNICEF and the WFP.

We can, therefore, make a difference. I’ve seen that writ large in the faces of little children  there.

What we are facing is a crisis brought on of course by two decades of armed conflict, we  know that. Two successive poor rainy seasons, we know that. And the result is a famine  effecting millions of people. In Somalia itself, four million.

Nearly half of the Somali population and 750,000 people at risk of death in the coming four  months, unless we have an urgent scale up. The worst drought in sixty years.

It’s important that we focus on the prognosis. That is, what will it be in the year ahead? And  let’s look carefully at what the data says. The first time that normal food supplies will be  resumed, if rains return, will be early next year. But that early next year harvest traditionally

only yields about 35 per cent of the total harvest for the country. The remaining 65 per cent  of the harvest comes not until next August, again assuming rains return. In other words, my  core words to friends and colleagues here is simply this: that we’re looking at another year of  crisis and the possibility of huge numbers of people dying unless we act.

So what’s to be done? Three things: we should support our good friends in Ethiopia and  Kenya where many people have fled and where many local people are affected. I’m  particularly conscious of the pressure on Kenya and that huge refugee camp in Dadaab and  we should all acknowledge in particular the hospitality of the Kenyan government and  people. Secondly in Somalia itself, where the bulk of the vulnerable lie, we need to support  both the UN agencies - where they can access -but also the Red Cross and the Red Crescent,  who have unique access to the south of the country, which is controlled by al-Shabaab. And  we must continue, thirdly, to fund the FAO, the WFP’s work on early warning systems and  the pre-positioning of food supplies.

So what is the funding gap right now? My understanding is that we’ve got appeals out there  for $2.4 billion. As of today only $1 billion has been allocated. We’re $1.4 billion short for  the 12 months ahead. This is a massive number. Even for the Red Cross - they have an  appeal for 120 million Swiss francs, 33 million have been allocated - they are 90 million  short and their work is critical in the most affected areas in the south.

Furthermore, it’s important that each of us lift our game. Australia has delivered - I say  delivered, not committed, we’ve actually handed over the money - for $104 million. We’re  the third largest national donor in the world, and we stand ready to do more.

But my appeal to all foreign ministers and aid ministers here present is that we must fund this  gap now, or we’ll witness an obscenity in the twelve months ahead.

Finally, what else must be done? There’s been much talk about did we have enough early  warning for this particular drought and the unfolding famine. I believe the answer is yes. I’ve  asked my officials to collate some 17 separate warnings issued by UN agencies going back to  August last year about this unfolding catastrophe.

The key thing is this: how do you effectively fund early warning systems and the  prepositioning of food? You must contribute to the WFP’s core funding so they can make  preparations for the future. That’s why we in Australia have provided the WFP with $180  million for core funding over four years, so that these decisions can be taken. What’s the  practical effect of that? We’ve helped efforts in Somalia - that’s Australia through the WFP -  preposition 400,000 tonnes of food, which is why in eastern Ethiopia we have less of a  problem than we would otherwise have.

I conclude Valerie by simply saying this: we as an international community can act. When  you look at what’s happened in Libya, we got together, we acted and we’ve changed things.  The international community can now do the same in the Horn of Africa.

Let’s not have a seminar in twelve months time about how we all failed.

I thank you
