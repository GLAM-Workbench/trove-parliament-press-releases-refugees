GOVERNMENTâ€™S $24,000 IMMIGRATION TRAVEL FARCE

The Government forked out nearly $24,000 late last year in a botched attempt to return a  failed asylum seeker to the Sudan in Africa.

With the Australian taxpayer footing the bill, Eidress Abdulrahman, an immigration  detainee from Baxter Detention Centre, under the escort of guards from a security  company embarked on a round trip to Africa that failed to see Mr Abdulrahman return to  Sudan.

The Government approved and paid for the trip in full, despite having no guarantee the  trip would see the successful return of Mr Abdulrahman.

The failed journey ended up costing the Australian taxpayer nearly $24,000 or the  equivalent of 930 bulk billed GP visits.

The complete failure of the botched attempt is further highlighted by the fact that the  Government tried to return Mr Abdulrahman to Sudan, via Tanzania, despite the  Immigration Department and the Refugee Review Tribunal refusing to accept that Mr  Abdulrahman was actually Sudanese!

Labor calls on Minister Vanstone to explain how she allowed such a farce that has the  Australian taxpayer footing the bill and Mr Rahman returned to immigration detention at  Baxter Detention Centre at further taxpayer expense.
