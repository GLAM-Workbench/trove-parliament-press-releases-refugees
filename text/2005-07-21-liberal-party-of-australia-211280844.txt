Clarification on Hwang comments

VPS 089/2005

I informed media in Alice Springs today (21 July) that the Hwang children were in detention at the request of their mother.

While it is true that the mother requested that her children join her in immigration detention I have since been informed by my Department that the  children were in fact detained as unlawful non-citizens under the Migration Act.

As part of the Departmentâ€™s ongoing review of detention cases it was found that the children could be released into the community on bridging  visas.

At the same time as the children were released on bridging visas, my department made alternative detention arrangements to allow the mother to  join the children in the community.
