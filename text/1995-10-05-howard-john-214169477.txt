AUSTRALIA'S DEFENCE POLICY

LESSONS FROM THE PAST,

PRINCIPLES FOR THE FUTURE

Address to the Victorian Branch o f the Australia D efence Association

Thursday 5 October 1995, Melbourne.

I was delighted to accept the invitation o f the Australia Defence Association to give what is  my first formal address on defence policy since becoming Leader o f the Opposition. I am  particularly pleased this evening to be addressing members o f an Association which  represents a range o f views from the broader community. I strongly share your

Association's guiding interest in promoting the defence and security o f our country.

In the past few years we have seen a significant change in Australia's strategic circumstances  with the end o f the Cold War. Globally, the environment is one o f continuing relief that the  threat o f a nuclear holocaust has been removed. Yet, paradoxically, our own region is

probably now less predictable and less stable than in the past.

The end o f the Cold War has significantly changed community attitudes towards defence  and security issues.

The Cold War era involved a constant threat o f nuclear annihilation. T hat. very threat  produced in many Western nations an acceptance o f high levels o f defence spending.

Now that the threat o f global annihilation has gone, the peoples o f those same nations no  longer uncritically accept the same volume o f defence spending. In other words, they  demand a peace dividend.

Yet the reality in our own region is not fully consistent with this, as in many respects there  is greater uncertainty and complexity, and less stability, in the post-Cold W ar regional  environment than previously existed.

All this has made the formulation o f defence policy more difficult.

In Australia we have seen a run down in defence expenditure to a point where we now  spend only two percent o f GDP on defence. There is continuing community and political  pressure for further reductions in defence spending.

This has thrown an added responsibility on those within the Australian community who  understand the strategic realities o f our own region to argue with even greater vigour the  case against a further decline in defence commitments.

1

These new demands impact on all aspects o f national defence. This evening, therefore, I  would like to explore the Coalition's priorities for defence policy.

Principles of Defence Policy

The Coalition believes that the direct defence o f Australia's interests and territories must  remain our first priority.

We believe that providing for our own security through a more self-reliant approach is a  sensible goal. Yet we also emphasise that self-reliance must be placed within the context o f  our strong alliances - especially with the United States - to which we remain vigorously  committed.

We also have a firm commitment to contribute to the maintenance o f stability in our region.  This is an important objective as it will help reduce the possibility o f Australia becoming  involved in armed conflict.

The Coalition believes that a strong defence force must be structured in a way appropriate  to today's circumstances. That means the maintenance and enhancement o f military skills,  timely intelligence, quick reaction times, rapid mobility and adequate firepower.

We rely on the partnership between industry and defence, and believe that this partnership  needs to be strengthened in a way which best meets the needs o f all parties. We believe that  a viable and vigorous defence industry is a key part o f greater self-reliance.

In the post-Cold War era the concept o f security has broadened. As a result, we believe that  there is a need for a mechanism to more effectively coordinate Australian security policy  across a range o f portfolio areas, with Defence integral to this. '

Most importantly, and this is a point that I would like to emphasise, we rely on the skills  and dedication o f our highly committed Defence Force personnel as the vital core o f any  defence effort.

Australia's New Strategic Circumstances

Australian defence policy has to be relevant to strategic circumstances. The end o f the Cold  W ar in 1989 brought with it far reaching changes, some o f which will take time to work  through.

However, what is very clear is that the end o f the Cold W ar has not necessarily made the  world or the Asia-Pacific region a safer place. With the absence o f the super-power balance  - which often acted as a deterrent to local conflicts - what we are faced with is a more  complex and uncertain strategic environment.

With the collapse o f the Soviet Union, the era o f a bipolar balance o f power has translated  into a focus on multipolar centres o f power. This means a greater range o f security interests  needs to be taken into account both in our immediate region and globally. Local and  regional tensions and conflicts which previously had been subsumed in great power rivalry  are coming to the fore.

2

Ethnic tensions, historical animosities and border disputes are increasingly impacting on  global security: the Gulf War, events in Somalia and in Bosnia are all illustrations o f this  trend.

As a result, there has been a greater focus on United Nations' peacekeeping activities, with  the definition and requirements o f peacekeeping significantly expanding in the last few  years. Australia has been proudly involved in a number o f peacekeeping operations  including Cambodia, Somalia, and Rwanda. However, peacekeeping requirements do place  greater demands on defence forces worldwide.

In addition, although the threat o f a global nuclear war between two super-powers may  have receded, the proliferation o f nuclear, chemical and biological weapons o f mass  destruction, along with their means o f delivery, is a dangerous global development. A  number o f former states o f the Soviet Union are now nuclear weapons states, and in our  region North Korea is believed to be close to possessing nuclear weapons. The control o f  nuclear technology and material is one o f today's most pressing problems.

The collapse o f the Soviet Union has also led to an increase in weapons and advanced  technology available on the international arms market. States throughout the world are  taking advantage o f a relatively cheap supply to improve their defence capabilities.

There are other important global developments which have an impact on security. These  include potential politico-religious conflicts, management o f significant flows o f refugees,  the international drug trade, and pressures arising from global population growth.

Australia's security will be affected by these global trends and the impact o f these trends on  the Asia-Pacific region. Our security will also be influenced by more specific developments  in South East Asia, North East Asia and the Indian Ocean. ^

The Asian region post-Cold War is characterised by a complexity o f factors:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ the nations o f our region are developing more confident and assertive attitudes  towards defence and security. This is reflected in programs o f arms

modernisation which increase the technological and capability levels o f regional  defence forces;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ border disputes remain unresolved, with examples including disagreements  between China and Vietnam, within the ASEAN states, and between China and a  number o f regional states over the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ political tensions remain between China and Taiwan; ’

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ instability on the Korean peninsula is o f major concern;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ there is regional proliferation o f weapons o f mass destruction, including their  means o f delivery;

3

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ insurgencies continue in Cambodia, Burma and the Philippines; and

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ tensions remain on the Indian sub-continent.

These factors shape Australia's strategic environment and will have an impact on Australia's  defence and security planning. We need to recognise and respond to the uncertainty  generated by such a combination o f regional security issues.

On the positive side, regional security is underpinned by a web o f bilateral and multilateral  alliances, most relying on the essential role o f the United States in underwriting the security  o f the region. The United States' presence in the Asia-Pacific is, if anything, even more  important today than it was during the Cold War. There exists general support in the region  for the continuation o f this role.

It is vital to ensure that the United States does remain engaged in the region. The United  States' withdrawal from the Philippines and its expectation o f greater burden-sharing by  regional allies, has led to the impression o f a reduced commitment to the region. Domestic  pressure in the United States for a peace dividend adds to this impression. We therefore  welcome statements from the United States that it intends to retain a substantial defence  deployment to the region.

By demonstrating a strong commitment to defence stability in the Asia-Pacific, Australia  together with our regional partners can do much to encourage and support the maintenance  o f a strong United States military presence.

In addition, I believe that the development o f the ASEAN Regional Forum has the potential  to assist in managing the diversity of security interests which exist in the region.

And o f course, the phenomenal economic growth o f Asia and the growing economic and  trade interdependence o f regional states should exert pressure for stability.

Whilst the Coalition has for some time recognised the regional implications o f recent global  change, there are signs that the Government has not.

The Government's 1994 Defence White Paper - "Defending Australia"

One salutary lesson we must draw from the past is the consequence o f Labor's slow  response to change. The latest Defence White Paper was released in November 1994. Given  we saw the end o f the Cold W ar in 1989, the Government took an excessively long time -  five years - to respond to significantly changed global and regional strategic circumstances.

During this time, Australia's defence policy was adrift, with no clear directions to guide  defence planning for the entire period. As a consequence, there was no reassessment o f  purchases o f large items o f equipment or o f force restructuring in the light o f Australia's  changed security environment.

Yet the release o f the new White Paper shows clearly that Labor has still not come to terms  with the end o f the Cold War.

4

ÃÂ

The White Paper is largely a failure with no genuine effort to rethink defence policy in light  o f the new demands Australia must face. What the White Paper contains is a rationale for  past policy. It is really only an incremental adjustment to the 1987 White Paper which was  prepared in entirely different strategic circumstances. Labor failed to meet the challenge of  developing a new strategic vision to accommodate changed circumstances.

The White Paper does nothing to solve the Government's failure in five key areas:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ the lack o f adequate combat capability; Ã¢ÂÂ¢ the drift in the ANZUS alliance; Ã¢ÂÂ¢ no clear approach to regional engagement; Ã¢ÂÂ¢ deficiencies in the Ready Reserve scheme; and Ã¢ÂÂ¢ neglect o f defence force personnel.

I would like to spend some time exploring each o f these failures as they must be addressed  to improve the effectiveness o f our fighting force.

1. Labor has ignored deficiencies in combat capability

There are deficiencies in the combat power o f the Australian Defence Force. A  disproportionate emphasis is placed on support activities relative to the size o f the combat  force. Too much o f the defence budget is spent on administration and not enough on  combat capability. And Labor has allowed this to happen.

It is vital that we have adequate combat capability to provide for the direct defence o f  Australia. Yet there are many examples o f deficiencies in combat capability that I could cite.  The more telling examples include:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The Army has only four (with a fifth in the planning stages) regular combat battalions.  These four battalions comprise only 2,300 personnel out o f a total Army personnel  number o f 27,000. Adding in other combat units, only around one in four Army  personnel have a direct combat role. The rest are engaged in support activities.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The Navy is suffering from a critical shortage o f qualified personnel, which makes it  almost impossible to crew its small fleet o f combat vessels. On present estimates, the  Navy will not be able to fully staff the six new Collins Class submarines or eight ANZAC  frigates when they are all in service. Only around one third o f the Navy's 15,000

personnel are employed in combat roles.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The Air Force is also suffering from a critical shortage o f air crew and air frames. While  we have adequate numbers o f strike aircraft and tactical multi-role fighters, we lack  enough maritime patrol aircraft and transport aircraft to perform effectively even in  realistic exercise scenarios, let alone in real military contingencies. The Air Force is also

suffering a significant shortage o f pilots and air traffic controllers. For the Air Force,  ninety percent o f personnel are engaged in support roles. Only ten percent have direct  combat roles.

5

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The General Reserve is nominally at a strength o f 26,000, o f which 11,000 are deemed  "non-effective" due to having served for not more than ten days in the last year. Yet the  General Reserve is required to provide sixty percent o f the combat force. They are  undertrained and underchallenged which has led to an unacceptably high level o f  personnel losses.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Ammunition stock-holding is also inadequate. We know that Australia holds very low  levels o f stocks, not even enough to supply the force for more than a couple o f weeks in  a real conflict. The Government has had no adequate policy on the amount o f  ammunition that Australia needs to hold in stock to deal with its scenario o f shortÂ­ warning conflicts in our north.

Labor must take the blame for running down Australia's combat forces. The Government  has no policy framework which will address the critical lack in combat capability. Australia  is the fifteenth biggest defence spender in the world but the money is not being spent  effectively. Far too much is being spent on the inflated administrative structure, rather than  on the sharp end o f the Defence Force.

The Coalition will increase the emphasis on combat capability in our defence effort. We will  review activities which do not directly contribute to a highly effective military force and  divert the resources to the combat end. We will devote more time and resources to  operational training and less to support activities, whilst recognising the demands o f greater  self-reliance.

2. Labor has allowed the ANZUS alliance to drift.

Australia's alliance with the United States is drifting due to the Labor Government's neglect.

Labor down-played our alliance with the United States in the 1994 White Paper. The  alliance slipped down the priority list because o f the Government's single-minded focus on  building closer relations with the countries o f the region. The Coalition places a lot of  importance on regional engagement - indeed our 1992 Defence Policy statement "A Strong  Australia" pushed a then reluctant Government to embrace closer regional defence relations.  But we do not think this should be done at the expense o f the United States alliance.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ For a start, the Coalition recognises that the United States has long underwritten the  stability o f the region. We understand how this stabilising role is especially important in a  time o f transition - as we are currently experiencing. Virtually every country in the  region, including China, wants the United States military presence maintained to assist in  the management o f strategic competition. We will strongly encourage the continuation of  the United States presence in the Asia-Pacific and do more to promote closer ties.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The United States is also important to the direct defence o f Australia. The Coalition  supports the defence concept o f self-reliance, but this has to be within an alliance  framework. We must not forget how significant United States' equipment, intelligence  and logistic support is to Australia. And we continue to value the role played by the US-  Australia joint facilities.

6

Labor, more generally, has neglected the United States. Not only has the alliance's priority  slipped in the White Paper, but the Government did not include the United States in the  Indian Ocean Forum economic and security discussions in Perth earlier this year, and nor  does Senator Evans include the United States on his "East Asia Hemisphere" map.

The Coalition will do more to promote closer links with the United States. Neither we, nor  our neighbours believe that we have to choose between Asia or the United States.

We will reinvigorate the United States defence alliance to reflect new regional and security  realities, whilst at the same time strengthening regional ties. Increasing Australia-United  States exercising and training opportunities, joint research and development, greater United  States access to Australian facilities, and the potential for United States pre-positioning o f

equipment in Australia are a few o f the areas which we will evaluate.

3. Labor does not have a clear approach to regional engagement

The Coalition realised the importance o f regional defence engagement some time before  Labor did. We have had a policy supporting closer defence relations with the region since  1992. In contrast, the Government's first consideration o f this was in the "Strategic Review"  published in December 1993, but not until the White Paper in November last year did we  get a statement o f policy.

There are a number o f ambiguities in the Government's approach to regional engagement:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The 1994 White Paper argues that defence planning will be based on an assessment o f  regional capabilities which could be brought to bear against Australia, rather than an  assessment o f threat from the region. We believe that this is a simplistic view as surely a  combination o f capability and intention is a more effective way o f determining the  scenarios Australia may have to meet.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ A competing pressure has arisen in Government defence policy between a focus on the  requirements for the defence o f Australia, and at the same time the need to pursue the  closest possible defence cooperation with our regional neighbours.

There are unresolved tensions between the Government's focus on defence partnership  with the region versus the region as the potential source o f threats; between the force  structure needed for the defence o f Australia versus that needed for regional engagement  activities; and unresolved competing resource choices which will result from these

differing priorities.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The Government fails to understand the importance o f developing closer relations with  N orth Asia. The overwhelming Government priority in regional engagement is towards  South East Asia. Yet it is in North Asia where lie the most pressing Asia-Pacific security  concerns which may have an impact on our more immediate region.

7

As a result, security policy needs re-balancing to see if we have got the mix right between  defence o f Australia concerns and the need to enhance regional engagement. Labor has  failed to do this, not least because Defence and Foreign Affairs Ministers have not been able  to work closely enough together to overcome differences o f perception and priorities.

Despite having six years to do it, Labor has still not developed an adequate regional security  policy appropriate for the post-Cold War era. The ambiguities in its approach to regional  engagement need to be resolved if Australia is to have an effective security policy.

The Coalition will ensure that defence o f Australia remains our top priority, and that we will  contribute to the stability o f the region in a way compatible with that priority. We will  develop closer relations with North Asian states in addition to South East Asia, and

strengthen our regional bilateral defence relationships to address the imbalance which has  arisen in Labor's policy.

4. Deficiencies in the R eady Reserve Scheme

I have already mentioned Labor's failure to provide adequate combat capability. In relation  to this, the Coalition also has a number o f serious concerns about the Governments Ready  Reserve scheme.

The first concern is about the impact which the Ready Reserve scheme has on the Regular  Army.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ When the Ready Reserve was introduced in 1991 essentially as a cost cutting measure,  Labor cut the number o f Regular Army battalions from six to four. Then late last year the  Government said they would again begin to raise a fifth regular battalion.

However, four or even five regular battalions does not give us enough flexibility to plan  for defence operations, as we saw when we sent a battalion to Somalia in 1993. It also  makes it harder to keep a large peacekeeping force deployed overseas without  unacceptably weakening our defence capabilities at home.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The problem with the Ready Reserve scheme is that it does not fill the gap left by  Labors decision to cut the regular battalions. There are still serious questions about  what kind o f call-out provisions are needed so that the Ready Reserve can be used in  contingencies short o f a direct attack on Australia. The effect o f the Ready Reserve,  therefore, has been to make the Army less flexible.

The Coalition's second concern about the Ready Reserve is its cost.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The Government now says that the Ready Reserve 6 Brigade in Brisbane costs about 65  percent o f the cost o f the previous regular brigade. When the scheme started, Labor said  the Ready Reserve would cost only about a third o f the regulars. There are problems  with the current costing o f the scheme which makes accurate figures impossible to  obtain. What is clear is that the Ready Reserve costs much more than Labor originally

said it would.

8

We need to look again at whether the Army can afford the costs o f administering three  totally different forms o f service - the Regulars, Ready Reserve and General Reserve.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Even if Labors current costing is correct, we need to remember that this gets us a force  which operates together only fifty days a year after the initial one year training. So that is  65 per cent o f the cost for less than one-sixth o f the time the Regular force operates.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ What that means is that the Ready Reserve is not that ready at all. No-one should expect  that a force which operates together for fifty days a year will be anywhere near as ready  for military service as a full-time Army brigade.

The Coalition's third concern about the Ready Reserve is that it has turned the General  Reserve into the poor third cousin o f the Defence Force.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ M ore for political reasons than anything else, Labor has poured resources into the Ready  Reserve. But the effect has been that the General Reserve continues to be starved o f  funds leaving deficiencies in its training and operational ability, which have had an  unfortunate impact on morale.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ This lack o f meaningful deployment and training opportunities, as well as inadequate  conditions o f service, has contributed to high wastage levels in the General Reserve.

Although a recently released report on the Ready Reserve (authored by Lieutenant-General  John Coates (retired) and D r Hugh Smith) argues for its retention, the Coalition continues  to have serious doubts about the viability o f the Ready Reserve.

5. Labor's lack of support for Defence Force personnel

The Coalition is very concerned by the Government's neglect o f Defence Force personnel.

We now have the lowest force strength o f regular uniformed service personnel in thirty  years - approximately 58,000. This represents a decline in regular force numbers o f about  fifteen percent in three years.

The Defence Force is suffering from significant undermanning and a loss o f experience as  the services shrink. This means declining career opportunities and increasing morale  problems. It also leads to greater demands on Defence Force personnel as they try to do

more with less.

Conditions o f service are being eroded as the Government focuses on big ticket items o f  expenditure. Whilst the Coalition recognises the problem o f block obsolescence o f  equipment early in the next century, this should be addressed by careful management o f the  defence budget and cutting o f administrative activities, rather than reallocating money which  should be spent on service personnel.

Labor does not adequately value the people who make up Australia's defence force.  Personnel interests are being sacrificed by the Government as the easier option rather than  having to examine how efficiently each defence dollar is spent.

9

The Coalition believes that it is the efforts o f our highly dedicated Defence men and women  which underpin Australia's defence force and provide for the defence o f our national  interest. We value that effort and would place the highest priority on ensuring that a fair,

satisfying and valued career is available to all who volunteer to serve their country.

Future Directions

The points I have just made indicate five o f the Coalition's major areas o f emphasis for the  future. To reiterate:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ We will increase the emphasis on combat capability and increase resources devoted to  this by redirecting resources from administrative and support functions;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The Coalition will promote closer defence links with the United States;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Defence o f Australia remains our top priority, but we will also enhance our contributions  to the stability o f the region in a way compatible with that priority. We will develop  closer relations with North Asia, strengthen our regional bilateral defence relationships  and our participation in the Five Power Defence Arrangements and the ASEAN Regional  Forum;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The Coalition has serious concerns about the Ready Reserve scheme as it does not  address gaps in defence capabilities, it lacks readiness and its cost is high relative to its  capacity.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ We will place the highest priority on Defence Force personnel to ensure that a fair,  satisfying and valued career is available to all who volunteer to serve their country.

The Coalition also believes that in this post-Cold W ar era, there is a greater need to think in  terms o f having a single security policy which would give weight to the interaction  between defence, foreign, and trade and economic priorities and policies.

We believe there needs to be a more effective mechanism for coordinating these dimensions  and ensuring that Australia's interests, especially regional interests, are better managed. We  have had a number o f examples in recent years o f hiccups in regional relationships which  could have been avoided with more effective coordination. Australia has fairly solid defence  relations with a number o f regional neighbours which luckily have remained largely immune  from political difficulties. The Coalition will ensure that our defence, foreign and trade  approaches are more closely coordinated in the future by ensuring that appropriate  Ministerial and Cabinet arrangements are put in place.

Conclusion

The Government has failed to respond to the new demands of the post-Cold War world.  White Papers should set strategic guidance for the future ten years at least. The 1994 White  Paper rubber-stamped the strategic guidance o f the previous eight years. It has little to say  about Australia's future defence and security.

10

The challenge that the Coalition will accept is to ensure that policy settings for the defence  o f Australia are appropriate to the likely future development o f the regional security  environment. Similarly, careful thought needs to be given to ways o f enhancing regional  engagement and how this aim interacts with defence o f Australia priorities. Once this policy  interaction is resolved, clearer guidance can be given to our force structure and equipment  priorities.

Australia does not have an adequate long term defence and security strategy, yet this is vital  to our future. The Coalition will ensure that ongoing careful evaluation and formulation o f a  defence strategy for the future is one o f its highest priorities.
