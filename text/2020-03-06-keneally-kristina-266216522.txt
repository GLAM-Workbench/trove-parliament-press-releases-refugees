ADDRESS TO THE LAW COUNCIL OF AUSTRALIA IMMIGRATION LAW

CONFERENCE 2020



MELBOURNE



FRIDAY, 6 MARCH 2020



*** CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY ***



I acknowledge the traditional owners of the land on which we meet, and pay my respects

to elders, past and emerging.



As the High Court recently affirmed, Australia’s First Peoples have a unique connection to

the land and waters of Australia, and we await the day that our nation’s founding document

- the constitution - recognises this land’s indigenous people.



I thank the Law Council of Australia and its Migration Law Committee for inviting me here

today - particularly the chair of the committee, Georgina Costello, as well as David Prince

and Joanne Kinslor for organising the conference.



I would like to acknowledge in the room:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Former Anti-slavery Commissioner of the UK, Kevin Hyland OBC,

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ NSW acting Anti-slavery Commissioner, Jennifer Burn; and

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Federal Circuit Court Judge Riethmuller.



Last Sunday night, as Members of Parliament and Senators descended on Canberra and

arrived at their home away from homes, a mini-series - a drama - called “Stateless”

premiered on the ABC.



The show features a wonderfully talented cast including Fayssal Bazzi, Yvonne Strahovski,

Cate Blanchett, Asher Keddie, Marta Dusseldorp and Dominic West, amongst others.



It told a story many people who now call this country call home have been through.



A story that seemed all too real.



It was a story about immigration detention.



I will say - immigration detention is part of migration system and it always will be.



It’s a form of an administrative detention that’s used to control non-citizens or facilitate their

return to their country of origin.



From visa overstayers to hardened criminals, immigration detention rightly has its place as

part of our migration system.



At the same time, our immigration detention network has often been a place of secrets and

sometimes treated as a place of punitive - rather than administrative - detention.



There are some people being held for upwards of 10 years, even indefinitely, in Australia’s

immigration detention network.



It’s one of the many facets of our immigration system which the public rightly questions -

particularly when faced with lacking transparency or concerning allegations.



It is similar to how 10 kilometres away from here in the Mantra Hotel in Preston, there are

currently close to 60 asylum seekers and refugees being held there.



Part of the hotel is a now Alternative Place of Detention - or an APOD.



It’s detaining people who were once in either Nauru or PNG and have been transferred to

Australia for temporary medical treatment.



In an ideal world - or, at least, one in which Tony Abbott hadn’t shelved the New Zealand

resettlement deal - these people would have already been resettled in a third country by

now.



Instead, they have been moved from one form of migration limbo to another - being

stripped of decency, dignity and the opportunity to determine their own futures.



These examples aren’t news to anyone in this room.



And they are just some facets of Australia’s incredibly complex and dynamic migration

system which is facing the consequences of serious and significant neglect under the

current Government.



The current Government has been in power for the past 7 years and they are responsible

for the administration of, as well as any amendments to, Australia’s migration law.



I say this not to make a partisan point but to rather provide context to the issues that I am

going to raise.



These issues - these failures - go to the heart of immigration law in this country and how

the failures of the current Government impact the lives of real people.



These issues also impact you as immigration lawyers.



The most obvious example and a concern for many in this room is the Migration

Amendment (Regulation of Migration Agents) Bill 2019.



I will make clear for the beginning - Labor supports this legislation and hopes the

Government seeks to pass it through the Parliament expeditiously.



Even Government Senators recommended, quote, “the Senate pass the bills without

delay” in the report from the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional

Affairs.



The first iteration of this legislation was introduced in June 2017 and - despite having

bipartisan support - the Government failed to pass it.



This delay in abolishing the dual regulation of immigration lawyers rests squarely at the

feet of Minister Peter Dutton - as well as the many other Immigration Ministers and

Assistant Ministers.



No less than six Ministers or Assistant Ministers have had carriage of this legislation.



This is a piece of legislation which stemmed from recommendations made in 2014 -

recommendations made three Prime Ministers ago.



In fact, the current Prime Minister was the Immigration Minister when the OMARA review -

the catalyst for this legislation - was being undertaken.



It should come as no surprise that there were 8 pieces of migration legislation the Minister

for Home Affairs failed to pass in the last Parliament.



They sat on the notice paper for an accumulative of 3749 days.



Naturally, Labor did not support all of these pieces of legislation - and rightly so given the

nature of some of the measures included in them.



Some of these bills have been reintroduced to the Parliament since last year’s election and

are now before either the House or the Senate - where, if future parliamentary sitting

weeks are anything like the four weeks we have endured this year, they may well continue

to stagnate much like their predecessors.



The Government - who are in their seventh year - not only lack the ability to negotiate or

progress legislation, but fail to have a plan for Australia.



Even the supposed plans they so enthusiastically spruik - such as their plan to encourage

regional migration through provisional permanent visas and Designated Area Migration

Agreements or DAMAs - are in disarray.



The Government’s two new visas - the Skilled Work Regional (Provisional) visa and the

Skilled Employer Sponsored Regional (Provisional) visa - opened for applications on 16

November 2019, some three months ago.



Despite this, the supporting legislation for these visas - particularly amendments to ensure

that new permanent migrants can access appropriate social safety nets - is yet to pass the

Parliament six months after being first introduced.



As for DAMAs, despite these regional agreements being heralded as the solution for

Australia’s regional migration woes - as of 31 December only two visas in the entire

country had been granted under the Government’s new agreements.



Two visas across six agreements.



When it comes to immigration law in Australia - The Government is stuck between inaction

and ignorance.



On one hand - this is a Government without the ability to pass migration legislation, even if

that legislation has bipartisan support.



On the other - you have a Government, and a Minister, willing to ignore the symptoms that

are presenting themselves when it comes to the abysmal health of Australia’s migration

system.



Since I became the Shadow Minister for Home Affairs, I have sought to challenge the

current Minister’s track record.



Whilst talking points may be a strength of Mr Dutton’s, his ability to oversee the

Department of Home Affairs and his inability to arrest the emerging problems is plagued

with incompetence.



Some people have questioned the topics I have brought to the fore - including some I will

touch on here today - but, as the alternative Government, with me as the alternative

Minister, it is my job within Labor to hold these failings to account.



The health of Australia’s migration system is dire.



As of 31 December, there were over 216,000 people on bridging visas in Australia - the

majority of whom would be waiting for the Department of Home Affairs to process their

substantive visa applications.



This has almost doubled since Labor left office in 2013.



The processing time for 90% of partner visas is currently at an astonishing 31 months.



That’s over two-and-a-half years Australian citizens are waiting to progress in their lives

with their partners, husbands or wives.



There are currently 180,000 people in that position - over 90,000 Australians and 90,000

of their respective partners - in a state of migration limbo.



Our permanent migration intake has been reduced by the current Government whilst the

number of temporary migrants in Australia continues to swell - an issue I addressed in a

recent speech to the John Curtin Research Centre.



There are over 62,000 visa overstayers in Australia - and I doubt that Mr Dutton knows

where all of those non-citizens are.



All these migration matters are only complicated further by the caseload at the

Administrative Appeals Tribunal.



As of 31 January, there were over 66,500 cases before the Migration and Refugee tribunal

of the AAT.



Case dates are currently being listed for 2022.



This ever-growing backlog is not going to improve with ignorance or incompetence.



These symptoms affect you, they affect your clients and they affect Australia and the fabric

of our society.



Whilst the Government professes their “strong borders” rhetoric, one of the starkest red

flags in our migration system is the number of people arriving by airplane and claiming

asylum in Australia.



There's nothing wrong with claiming asylum - it's an important legal, and human, right.



However, in the past five years, over 100,000 airplane arrivals have claimed asylum.



By the Government’s own admission, when processed, 90% of claims such as these have

been found to be unmeritorious.



The stress that these arrivals are placing on the migration system - particularly the

appeals system - are wide-reaching.



Over 1,900 people arrived in January and claimed asylum.



In the same period, the Department of Home Affairs only finalised 795 protection

applications.



On top of this, the number of people in Australia who have been found not to be owed

protection and have to be deported is nearing 50,000.



On those statistics alone, it is clear to see how this issue will continue to spiral out of

control.



New Questions on Notice reveal how the online lodgement of tourist visas for Chinese

nationals - which was introduced in February 2017 - has led to a surge in the number of

people arriving by air and claiming asylum by close to 700%.



In the 12 months after online lodgement was introduced, 7,304 Chinese nationals on

tourist visas made claims for asylum.



By comparison, in the 12 months prior to online lodgement being introduced only 1,060

Chinese nationals on tourist visas made claims for asylum.



In total, between February 2017 and September 2019, 13,462 Chinese nationals on tourist

visas have claimed asylum in Australia.



Now this is not an issue of a person’s nationality - it is about the integrity of our migration

system - and an insight into how backlogs have grown so quickly.



Claiming asylum is an important right that we need to uphold, and you play a vital role in

supporting that right. But an overloaded system that discourages or delays genuine claims

disadvantages all asylum claims.



As the backlog grows, so does the honeypot for people - or people smugglers - to

facilitate travel to Australia for the specific purpose of having an extended stay in our

country, often to access the labour market.



As that continues, along with the wilful ignorance on the part of the Government, the

exploitation of these vulnerable people - a developing economic underclass - will only

continue to grow.



Plain and simple - this is a work scam.



But the real exploitation comes when workers are sent out - sometimes ordered - to

dodgy labour hire companies facing pay as low as $4 an hour, physical or sexual assault,

extortionate costs for food and accommodation, and curtailed movement as their passports

are withheld.



It’s no better than indentured servitude. In a lot of cases, it’s worse.



Despite Peter Dutton’s claims this is a “red herring” - those were the exact words he used

- even the Australian Federal Police have raised alarm.



On Wednesday, the Herald Sun reported of people who are being held as sex slaves,

locked in illegal brothels here in Melbourne and being forced to pay off debts.



The illegal brothels - as opposed to legal ones - are being run out of massage parlours,

apartments and houses, smuggling, or trafficking workers from overseas.



According to the article, operators pay up to $10,000 for women to come to Australia,

mainly from countries including Vietnam, Thailand, China and South Korea.



AFP Detective Superintendent Jayne Crossling told the Herald Sun, and I quote:



“They have questionable visa status. They are often tricked into thinking they do have a

legitimate visa when they don’t. In many instances they are not free to move.”



This is happening here - in this very city - potentially mere blocks away from here.



Some of the most significant impacts of exploitation can be seen at a local level.



Not only are local farmers faced with severe labour shortages - or the risks of hiring illegal

workers - local governments are now equally being faced with confronting situations.



Early this month in northern Tasmania, close to 70 people participating in a legal season

worker program were found living in a five-bedroom house.



The “dormitory style” accommodation was uncovered by the local council with the people

living, unsurprisingly in quote, “slum-like conditions”.



I don’t think parents putting a bunch of grapes in their child's lunchbox that they bought at

Woolworths, Coles, or Aldi, contemplate the fact that those grapes were picked by a

nineteen-year-old exploited French backpacker.



Or that the tomatoes used to make pasta sauce for the family dinner were picked by a

Taiwanese national who has had their passport confiscated by a dodgy labour-hire firm

and is being held in slavery-like conditions.



These aren’t rare situations; they aren't occasional. They are stories I hear every day.



If this is what is happening under the Morrison Government through their legal visa

programs - imagine what is taking place under the cover of the darkness and dodginess of

illegal operators.



It’s clear the Morrison Government has no plan to stop the spread of exploitation of

temporary workers and the slavery-like conditions that have become all too common

across Australia.



This exploitation, as well as airplane arrivals claiming asylum, are some of the topics that

will be covered in the Select Committee on Temporary Migration which Labor successfully

established in the Senate.



The inquiry is looking at the impact temporary migration has on the Australian economy

broadly - including wages and jobs, social cohesion, and workplace rights and conditions.



The inquiry - which is currently taking submissions - is due to report in December, and I

expect recommendations to address issues such these and airplane arrivals. If you haven't

made a submission - I urge you to.



In the interim, it’s incumbent on the Morrison Government to try and stem these arrivals

because a failure to do so will only add to the intractable caseload.



The Government could look to properly fund and resource the interagency taskforce

responsible for addressing these concerns - Taskforce Cadena, invest in more Airline

Liaison Officers in overseas airports to detect people who aren’t travelling to Australia as

genuine temporary entrants or look for identity management improvements.



Australia is not the first country to encounter these problems. Germany and the US have

both faced similar challenges and took pragmatic steps to resolve particular backlogs,

while also stemming the trafficking of people into their labour markets.



The Government may attempt to respond with crass or callous measures such as banning

onshore asylum claims form certain countries, rolling out widespread immigration detention

- a proposal the current Prime Minister previously raised in Cabinet as the Immigration

Minister - or reducing the Government humanitarian intake while processing a self-inflicted

backlog.



These won’t work and would undermine people’s legal rights and have corrosive effects on

our migration system or humanitarian program.



I warn of the Government’s potential overreach when it comes to legislative or policy

responses because you only have to look at their track record.



The current Minister for Home Affairs will always look for blunt measures to address issues

within the migration system.



You only have to look to the Government’s Migration Amendment (Strengthening the

Character Test) Bill 2019.



As you well know, under the Migration Act the Minister can already cancel the visas of non-citizens and deport foreign criminals.



This includes people convicted of serious crimes involving violence, sexual offences,

weapons offences, breaches of AVOs, and offences against women and children.



In fact, these extremely broad discretionary powers that already exist mean foreigners do

not even need to spend a day in jail or even be convicted of a crime to have their visa

cancelled.



In 2014 Labor, in opposition, supported the amendments to the Migration Act because we

believed these were necessary provisions to keep the Australian community safe.



I am constantly bemused by this Government’s approach - blaming Labor - for programs

introduced and administered by the former Immigration Minister, Scot Morrison, and the

current Minister for Home Affairs, Peter Dutton.



The administration of this program is very poor, yet somehow Labor is to blame.



One of those areas is how the current Government have managed the operation of the

laws with our close friends in New Zealand.



I respect New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern for taking the opportunity to raise her

concerns, and the concerns of her country.



You would expect Australia to do the same if we had concerns about a law in New

Zealand.



Ms Ardern raised concerns because these laws have impacted more New Zealanders than

any other nationality - and often those New Zealanders have spent the majority of their

lives in Australia, sometimes since birth.



The Government’s proposed legislative measures to “strengthen” the Migration Act does

not change the fact the Minister already has the power to cancel visas under Sections 501

and Section 116 of the Migration Act.



The proposed legislation does create significant unintended or undesirable consequences

- including significant damage to Australia’s relationship with New Zealand.



The retrospective nature of the proposed legislation means the Minister could reach into

the past of a 70 year old Australian permanent resident and cancel their visa for a low-level

offence which occurred when they were 16 years old.



These concerns - as well as the fact that a person could have their visa cancelled for

something as trivial as a conviction of assault for grasping a person by the sleeve - are

just examples why the Parliament, and in particular the Senate, must always scrutinise the

laws this Government puts forward.



It’s why I will always hold Mr Dutton to account.



Ever since the Minister for Home Affairs’ personal intervention to grant visas to two au

pairs the discretionary powers of the Minister, as well as the Immigration Minister, have

been thrust into the public spotlight.



Once described as “god-like” powers by former Labor Immigration Minister Chris Evans,

Ministers within the Home Affairs and Immigration portfolios have had the ability and

discretion to intervene in individual cases.



These are important provisions within the Migration Act which I believe should exist.



Yet it’s their often opaque and sometimes mind-numbingly inconsistent operation or use

which I know raise concerns for those in this room.



I will say we are seeing a somewhat concerning emerging trend where it takes personal

stories to escalated in the media for the Home Affairs Minister, or Immigration Minister, to

be compelled to respond.



I know cases like this will always be covered by the media because, much like the ABC’s

TV show Stateless, they tell real stories about real people.



However, I would like to think that each of the ministers under the Home Affairs portfolio -

and I know there has been a number of them with shifting responsibilities under the current

Government - would be capable of doing their job, reading their briefs and treating cases

with the considered care, focus and compassion that Australians would expect of a

Minister with “god-like” powers.



And despite the Minister possessing the powers to intervene right now, we still see a family

- including two young girls - continuing to be detained by this Government on Christmas

Island whilst their case drags on in the courts and their local community in Biloela,

Queensland just wants them to be returned home.



The Biloela Family are just some of the Legacy Caseload in Australia.



The cohort of asylum seekers who arrived under the previously Labor Government live

within communities across Australia, particularly communities here in Melbourne and

Sydney.



As of January, the Department of Home Affairs still have close to 6,500 cases on hand or

at review - the significant majority of which are for Safe Haven Enterprise Visas (or

SHEVs).



Over 17,000 Temporary Protection Visas (TPVs) and SHEVs have been granted so far -

and yet the real problem is going to arise when these visas expire after three or five years

respectively.



Some of the first TPVs granted are already being renewed - and the rest of the cohort will

follow.



According to the Incoming Government Brief provided to the Minister for Home Affairs and

obtained under Freedom of Information laws, these people will not have access to any

form of legal assistance when their renewals are due.



Many immigration lawyers - including those at the Refugee Advice and Casework Service

(RACS), who do fantastic work - are concerned how these renewals will be treated and

triaged by the Department of Home Affairs.



John Coyne from the Australian Strategic Policy Institute has described the Legacy

Caseload as, and I quote:



“a political time bomb to which the policy response has been slow. The option of removing

families that have grown community connections over several years is heartbreaking for all

involved as well as expensive.”



Many of these people have been in Australia for upwards of 10 years, living in community

and already been found to be owed protection. They are refugees.



Yet still, here is the current Government forcing vulnerable people to re-live the trauma of

the lives they have escaped or been forced to leave behind.



Whilst you may not always represent asylum seekers, I do hope when the Migration

Amendment (Regulation of Migration Agents) Bill I spoke of earlier becomes law, will allow

more lawyers to perform pro bono migration law work for some of the most vulnerable in

our society.



I am sure you will agree with me that quality, fair, and efficient legal representation is one

of the pillars of our justice system - and it should be treated with equal regard when it

comes to migration law.



Much like the Morrison Government’s neglect our migration system, it has failed to

adequately stand up against racism rearing its ugly head in our country.



At a time when anti-Semitic attacks have risen 30%, violent attacks of people of an Asian

appearance or the Muslim faith have occurred in suburbs across Australia, and ASIO has

declared right-wing extremism a threat capable of causing a terrorist attack in Australia, we

must reflect on the action we can take to arrest these trends.



The coronavirus - and the spread of misinformation around it, particularly on social media

- has been confronting.



It has caused damage not only to thriving Chinese communities across Australia but also

their livelihoods and, in turn, our economy and our cohesion.



As part of New Zealand’s response to the Coronavirus outbreak the NZ Human Rights

Commission declared on Facebook “coronavirus is not an excuse to be racist and

xenophobic”.



At the same time, the “Give Nothing to Racism” campaign by our neighbours across the

ditch is an investment in their future.



We should be doing the same.



Social cohesion does not create itself. And when social cohesion begins to crumble, it

requires proper governance, hard work, investment, and leadership for it to recover.



Labor has been calling on the Morrison Government to fund a new national anti-racism

campaign, promoting a zero tolerance approach to racism.



It’s been more than seven years since Prime Minister Julia Gillard funded the Racism - it

stops with us campaign.



It’s time for our Government to make this investment in our community’s social cohesion

yet again.



It is a call I am sure many in this room would back and one supported by the likes of the

Federation of Ethnic Communities Councils of Australia.



Today, I’ll join the Shadow Minister for Multicultural Affairs, Andrew Giles, in Chinatown to

launch Labor’s petition for Australians to stand against racism.



People need to know that when they see racism, not only should they stand up to it, but

they must have the confidence that their family, their neighbours, their friends will stand

with them.



I’ve covered just some of the matters in the expansive Home Affairs, Immigration and

Citizenship portfolios.



There are many other matters I haven’t delved into - skilled migration, community

sponsorship of refugees and the privatisation of Australia’s visa processing system to

name a few.



Yet it is clear this is a portfolio which requires attention to detail rather than ignorance and

incompetence.



Mr Dutton is a Minister with no plan for his Department or some the major issues facing our

migration system and wider Australia - and your profession.



I will continue to expose these failures - and work with you on the solutions.



I look forward to your questions. Thank you.
