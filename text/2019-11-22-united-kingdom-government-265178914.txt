COMMUNIQUÃÂ



1. We, the Home Affairs, Interior, Security and Immigration  Ministers of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, United Kingdom and  the United States of America (the “Five Countries”) have come  together in London, United Kingdom on 29-30 July 2019. Guided  by our shared responsibility and commitment to build a more  peaceful and secure world for our citizens, we affirm our  determination to promote our shared values and protect our nations  from the existing and emerging security threats faced in our  communities, at our borders, or in the cyber space.

Countering Online Child Sexual Exploitation and Abuse: Digital  Industry Roundtable

1. In five years, we have seen a near twenty-fold increase in industry  referrals of child abuse material to the National Center for Missing  and Exploited Children, from 1 million in 2014 to over 18 million  in 2018. Driven by the moral obligation to tackle this escalating  crisis we met representatives from Facebook, Google, Microsoft,  Roblox, Snap and Twitter. Together we heard from Thorn, and   survivors, about the devastating and lasting impacts of child sexual  exploitation and abuse, including through the continued  proliferation of abusive material online long after the actual abuse  ceases.

2. All participants agreed that tackling this epidemic requires an  immediate upscaling of the global response to ensure that all  children across the globe are protected against online sexual  exploitation and abuse, and that there is no safe space online for  offenders to operate.

3. We note the efforts of digital industry to develop a range of tools to  combat the threat, including grooming of children online, and the  work being undertaken to support uptake of these tools with

smaller companies. Whilst these are welcome steps, much more  must be done at pace - every day that passes more children are  being abused, exploited, and re-traumatised online. This must stop.

4. Building on the statement agreed at the 2018 Five Country  Ministerial we agreed with industry representatives to collaborate  to design a set of voluntary principles that will ensure online  platforms and services have the systems needed to stop the viewing  and sharing of child sexual abuse material, the grooming of  children online, and the livestreaming of child sexual abuse and the  ability to report such offences to law enforcement.

5. Today we agreed the core foundations upon which these principles  will be based and we call on all digital industry representatives to  engage with the Five Countries, through the Digital Industry  Engagement Senior Officials Group to collaborate so these can be  finalised at the end of September this year. We will be seeking  early and ongoing feedback from industry on how these principles  are being implemented in their day to day business.

6. Beyond this it is imperative that all sectors of the digital  industry including Internet Service Providers, device manufacturers  and others to continue to consider the impacts to the safety of  children, including those who are at risk of exploitation, when  developing their systems and services. In particular, encryption  must not be allowed to conceal or facilitate the exploitation of  children.

7. We affirm our support for law enforcement and front line  professionals who are bearing the burden of investigating these  heinous crimes. We recognise the importance of adequate access to  psychological and wellbeing support, as well as continuing to  develop means to reduce their exposure to traumatic content by  developing technological solutions.

8. We remain resolute in our determination to tackle this abhorrent  crime, safeguard children and protect victims and survivors.

Cyber and Online Threats

1. An open, interoperable, reliable, and secure internet is fundamental  to the social and economic development of communities across the  globe. With it comes a responsibility to tackle the complex and  evolving nature of those threats that seek to undermine its  potential. We also reaffirm the norms, rules, and principles for the  responsible behaviour of states in cyberspace previously endorsed

by the UN General Assembly in 2013 and 2015, and commit to  continue to work to see these norms strengthened and  implemented.

2. It is also vital that Five Countries partners support each other in  ensuring coordinated and efficient responses to cyber threats,  including incidents at a national and international level, and against  different types of victims. We commit to continue to develop and  share learning on cyber threats and responses in order to facilitate a  collective improvement in both understanding and response  capability across the Five Countries.

3. The nature of 5G, whilst bringing unparalleled opportunity, will  increase the risks to the integrity of our telecommunications  networks. The Five Countries have each individually undertaken or  are undertaking substantial reviews of the security risks to 5G  networks. There is agreement between the Five Countries of the  need to ensure supply chains are trusted and reliable to protect our  networks from unauthorised access or interference. We recognise  the need for a rigorous risk-based evaluation of a range of factors  which may include, but not be limited to, control by foreign  governments. We also recognise the need for evidence-based risk  assessment to support the implementation of agreed-upon  principles for setting international standards for securing cyber  networks.

Emerging Technologies

1. Emerging technology reflects the growth of increasingly  autonomous, intelligent, and connected devices that blur the  distinctions between the physical and digital worlds. We recognise  the importance of protecting our citizens and economies from  threats whilst empowering them to engage with new technology.  The security of the Internet of Things (IoT) is a critical issue that  requires international cooperation and harmonisation of standards  to achieve the required effect across diverse markets.

2. It is essential that nations and their people can trust the technology  that will underpin their societies now and in the future. Emerging  technologies bring a range of opportunities and challenges,  including for our approaches to cyber security. We recognise the  importance of open, diverse, competitive, and trusted critical  technology markets, where security-by-design is a fundamental  principle. Our nations signed a joint Statement of Intent, which will

align our approaches to enhancing the security of the Internet of  Things devices, to provide better protection to users by advocating  that devices should be secure by design. The Statement will  encourage our nations to actively seek out opportunities to enhance  trust and raise awareness of best practices associated with IoT  devices and reaffirms the need to identify and engage likeminded  nations to encourage international alignment on IoT security.  We  welcome complementary international efforts to improve the  security of critical and emerging technologies.

3. In recent years unmanned aircraft systems, often referred to as  ‘drones’, have rapidly evolved in terms of capability, availability,  and uptake for commercial and recreational use. Drone technology  has the potential to offer significant benefits to economies and  quality of life. However, the malicious, unlawful, or inadvertent  misuse of drones and the data they collect can pose a risk to public  safety, be deliberately used to facilitate or commit a wide range of  criminal acts, and also present a threat to our national security. We  commit to create a stronger Five Country approach to drones  informed through co-ordinated and in-depth information sharing  around threat, vulnerabilities, and counter-drone technology. We  will also enable the Five Country security community to identify  what more could be done at the manufacturing stage to mitigate  drone risk by design. Work to commence this will begin  immediately and the UK will host a Five Country event at the  Home Office Security and Policing Event in March 2020 to  enhance cooperation.



Borders and Asylum

1. Facilitating the legitimate movement of people across our borders  is essential to our economic prosperity. We acknowledge the  importance of safe and regular immigration, protecting refugees,  and delivering timely protection to those making genuine asylum  claims. We reaffirm the positive benefits that managed  immigration, settlement, and integration brings to our societies.

2. We recognise the need to modernise border security systems to  deal with evolving threats. We therefore commit to pursue  expanded data sharing prior to and at the border to facilitate the  secure movement of legitimate travellers and goods and in ways

that maintain privacy, data security, and are consistent with  domestic law.

3. We reiterate the sovereign right of states to strong border  management, including the responsibility to deter, prevent, detect,  and disrupt those who seek to evade or facilitate the evasion of  border controls. We also recognise that our ability to deliver timely  protection to those genuinely fleeing persecution is hampered by  those who abuse or facilitate the abuse of our border and  immigration systems, including our asylum systems. We therefore  commit to increase our collaboration regarding such activity. We  commit to explore enhancing cross-border information sharing on,  but not limited to, travelling child sex-offenders, in line with  domestic legislation. We further reiterate our commitment to work  together and with global partners to secure the efficient removal of  individuals without lawful status in our countries.

Countering Foreign Interference - Election Security and  Strengthening Democracy

1. Building on last year’s commitment to establish a mechanism to  share approaches to combating foreign interference — being the  coercive, deceptive, and clandestine activities of foreign  governments, actors, and their proxies, to sow discord, manipulate  public discourse, bias the development of policy, or disrupt  markets for the purpose of undermining our nations and our  allies— our countries have shared strategies that protect our  electoral institutions and democratic processes from foreign  interference and other hostile state activity. We commit to  maintaining these efforts, and will continue our collaboration to  combat foreign interference in other areas such as the economy and  academia.
