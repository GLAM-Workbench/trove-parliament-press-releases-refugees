TRANSCRIPT OF THE LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION  THE HON JOHN HOWARD MP

DOORSTOP INTERVIEW - SYDNEY

Topics: Interest Rates, Pressures on Australian families

E&OE...........................................................................................

JOURNALIST:

Mr Keating - he gave pretty strong indications that there could be some movement on interest  rates. What's your...

HOWARD:

Well I watched the interview, and the overwhelming impression I got was that it offered no  hope to battlers that he's got any understanding of the pressure that Australian families are  under, particularly on the mortgage bill front.

JOURNALIST:

So you don't think there's going to be an interest rate movement down?

HOWARD:

I don't know what's going to happen, but you wouldn't have derived any hope. If you were a  battler, and you watched that interview, it was of the man who has no real understanding of  the pressure that Australian families are under.

JOURNALIST:

Mr Keating rejected suggestions by the National Party Leader, Tim Fischer of calling an  election before the APEC summit. It's looking more and more unlikely that you're going to  get a Federal election before Christmas, isn't it?

HOWARD:

The timing is not important, its whether the two major opponents have an understanding of  the pressure that Australian families are under and clearly from that interview, my Labor  opponent does not.

JOURNALIST:

So you're saying, you don't care when there's a Federal election?

HOWARD:

I'm far more interested in responding to the concerns of the Australian community.

JOURNALIST:

Do you have a preference for when the date might be?

HOWARD:

I'm far more interested in responding of the concerns of the Australian community.

Thank you.

JOURNALIST:

One thing, just talking about your own election prospects, there are some concerns about your  own seat as well, how do you feel?

HOWARD:

I'll be there.
