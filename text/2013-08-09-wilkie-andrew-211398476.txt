A STATEMENT REGARDING LABOR’S ASYLUM SEEKER AD CAMPAIGN





“Labor’s decision to continue taxpayer-funded ads in the Australian media about  their inhumane PNG asylum policy is hardly surprising.

“Running these ads in Australia was always about trying to win votes. The line  that ads are needed in Australian media to communicate with locals involved in  people smuggling is nothing more than a flimsy excuse.

“This ad campaign was clearly a cynical political move from the very beginning  so it’s no surprise Labor wants to continue running these ads until election day.

“I call on the Labor to immediately release exactly how much taxpayer money  they will have spent on this cynical vote-grabbing exercise by election day.”
