* DID you hear about the recent Pacific Ocean conference where  God appeared, amid thunder and lightning, before three statesmen?  "I have materialised," said Himself, "to prove that I exist and  to warn you that the world will end in 90 days.  " The amazed

politicians took the message home.

MIKHAIL GORBACHEV stood before the Supreme Soviet. "Comrades,"  he said, "I have bad news and bad news. First, I must report that  we have been wrong for almost 73 years. God does exist. Second  the world will end in 90 days."

GEORGE BUSH addressed a joint sitting of Congress. "My fellow  Americans," he said. "I have good news and bad news. First, I can  pledge to you that your President has irrefutable proof of the

existence of the Almighty, so justifying our Christian system of  government. Second, unfortunately, the free-enterprise system  will cease to exist in 90 days."

BOB HAWKE rose in Parliament. "Aagh, Mr Speaker," he said, "I  have good news and good news. First, I can confirm the existence  of God. This should take some of the pressure off Paul. Second,  I can now assure the House that no Australian child will live in

poverty 90 days days from now."

Senator Grant Tambling Country Liberal Party Senator  for the Northern Territory

JUNE 1990

People in the outback are the focus of my new  job as Shadow Minister for Regional

Development, External Territories and  Northern Australia.

The portfolio - covering Norfolk Island in  the east to north Queensland, Northern  Territory, Western Australia and Christmas  and Cocos Islands in the west - gives me an  opportunity to contribute north Australian  perspectives to debates and policy

discussions. So far I have visited Mildura,  Toowoomba, Townsville and Cairns. My other  position as Deputy Leader of the Federal  National Party in the Senate means I have a  greater say in the direction of the Coalition  Opposition parties. And as the Shadow

Minister representing Primary Industry in the  Senate, I recently led the debate on wool,  highlighting the ALP Government's ineptitude  as economic managers.

For now, though, thankyou to the hundreds of  Territorians who gave the CLP their time,  expense and hard work during the election  campaign. Let me assure you that my office -

and phone lines - are open to your advice.

* The apprehension of FOREIGN VESSELS off northern Australia this  financial year will cost taxpayers millions of dollars. And the  figure is set to rise with greater numbers of Indochinese boat  people seeking refuge in Australia and continued incursions by

Indonesian fishermen into the Australian Fishing Zone. My work  in Federal Parliament reveals that the Federal Government has no  long-term plan to cope with boat people and fishermen, a point  demonstrated only a few weeks ago. (See press release "Illegal

Fishermen and Boat People Force Reviews" 28.5.90)

* Northern Australia stands to lose its search and rescue  responsibilities under a controversial Civil Aviation Authority  plan to relocate AIR TRAFFIC AND FLIGHT SERVICES down south. Or,  in other words, the whole of northern Australia will be left  without a locally-based aviation search and rescue facility.  Darwin, which currently has the only Rescue Co-ordination Centre

in the north, will be forced to rely on Adelaide to co-ordinate  search and rescue activities.  The harshness of northern Australia  makes me acutely aware of the need for swift, efficient responses  to emergencies. We will not, and should not, tolerate less.

("SOS for Search and Rescue Centre" 7.6.90)

* The sale of houses owned by the IMMIGRATION DEPARTMENT in  Darwin was raised in the Senate Estimates Committee hearings in  Canberra. The Minister representing the Minister for Immigration,  Senator Nick Bolkus, informed me the matter was under

investigation but would not reveal details. Even so I believe  any inquiry into the sale of the houses must consider government  guidelines and the efficiency of departmental administration.  ("Sale of Immigration Dept Houses Under Investigation" 24.5.90)

* Four million people living in regional Australia will be the  victims of funding cuts to the ABC next financial year. The cuts,  ranging from $5 to $10 million, are likely to force the ABC to  again defer the SECOND REGIONAL RADIO NETWORK and its goal to  provide regional listeners with the same services as city

listeners. Even the ABC Managing Director, Mr David Hill, admits  the next budget cut "can do a lot of damage to the ABC" and that  it is "pretty savage stuff." I believe the Federal Government  must review its public broadcasting priorities urgently.

("ABC Hindered in Northern Australia" 18.6.90)

* VIETNAM VETERANS need to take a frontline role in the battle  for a better-trained and better-equipped Australian Defence  Force. That's what I told delegates to the 11th National Congress  of the Vietnam Veterans Association in Darwin recently. The facts  speak for themselves. Defence spending in Australia is at its  lowest for 40 years and our services are losing experienced and  capable defence personnel at an alarming rate. Our best guarantee  for peace is a well-trained and well-equipped defence force.

("Vietnam Veterans Urged to Highlight Defence Needs" 26.5.90)

* Sorting out problems in the administration of SOCIAL SECURITY  in remote Aboriginal communities has been high on my agenda. I  raised the matter with the Social Security Minister, Senator  Graham Richardson, as well as with officers of his department and  officials of the new Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander  Commission during comprehensive briefings in Canberra. My

concerns relate to the administration of the Community Agent.  Program and criticism from Aboriginal leaders about the lack of  assistance and training under the program. ("Social Security  Concerns in Remote Communities" 16.5.90)

* The NT will keep an eye on its two federal ALP representatives - Senator Bob Collins and Warren Snowdon -to see whether they can  come up with much-needed funds for the NT. Years of cutbacks at  the hands of the Hawke Labor Government have left us facing a $70  million shortfall next financial year. The first thing they ought

to do is guarantee the long overdue increases in TAX ZONE REBATES  in this year's August Budget. ("Senator Challenges Labor on NT  Funding" 1.6.90; "New Minister Fails First Test" 14.5.90; "Labor  Forgets Northern Australia ... Again" 8.5.90)

* TERTIARY INSTITUTIONS in northern Australia need to tap into  the expertise available in local scientific, defence and research  organisations. Prof Ray Golding of James Cook University,  Townsville, and Prof David Wigston of NT University, Darwin,  agree there is great potential for tertiary institutions to widen

technological expertise and expand opportunities for high  technology industries in their area. I am pleased to see that the  NT University is already taking up the idea with the Pine Gap  Joint Defence Facility in Central Australia. ("Tertiary

Institutions Urged to Broaden Horizons" 9.6.90)

* Young people from a range of professional and trade backgrounds  came together recently for my first SENATOR'S FORUM in Darwin.  The forum - an opportunity to meet and exchange views with young  people who are shaping the future of the NT - was the first of

a series I hope to run around the NT. I was also pleased to hold  discussions with the Leanyer Christian Youth Group and Young CLP.

* My work in the SENATE ESTIMATES Committee hearings in Canberra  last month highlighted coastal surveillance, illegal fishermen,  tax zone rebates, social security in Aboriginal communities,  social security and health services on Christmas Island,  electoral services, Aboriginal education, the Federal Airports  Corporation, Barunga bark painting and breakaway land councils.
