FOR PRESS 27 OCTOBER 1977

STATEMENT TO PARLIAMENT

i$>

Mr Speaker,  I wish to inform the House that the Government has  recommended to His Excellency the Governor General that the  House of Representatives be dissolved on 10 November 'next Â·   and that a general election for the members of the House of

Representatives be held on.Saturday,  10 December.

His Excellency has accepted my recommendation.  "

Mr Speaker,..the...places. _of one half of the members of the Senate  will become vacant on 30 June nextÃ¢ÂÂ  If their places are to  be filled by 1 July 1978, an election to fill them must be

held no later than May.  ,

Under the second paragraph of Section 13 of the Constitution an  election to fill vacant Seante places may be held within one year  before the places become vacant.

Members of this House were elected on 13 December 1975; its  term expires on 16 February 1979. However,  Section 28 of 1 the Constitution enables the House of Representatives to be  dissolved before then. It was the general practice prior to  1963 to hold elections forthe House of Representatives and for  half the Senate on the same date. Indeed, in 1955, the Governor-

General, Sir William Slim on the advice of the then Prime Minister  dissolved the House of Representatives much earlier than its  three year term to synchronise the elections for the two Houses. In that case, the election for both Houses was held some 18 months after the previous election for the House of Representative

In May this year, the Government put to the people a referendum  proposal which was intended to ensure that elections for both  Houses would have to be held simultaneously. The proposal was  supported by all political parties in the Parliament and the  arguments in favour of it were widely canvassed.

It was approved by a significant majority - 62 percent - of all  voters and by a majority of voters in three States.

It is the view of the Government that at the next election for  half the Senate, an election should also be held for the  House of Representatives.

This clear.ly accords with the view of the majority of the  Ã¢ÂÂ¢  :  ralian people as reflected in the referendum vote. '-'r Speaker, it is a veiw shared by the Opposition. VaSced,Â· in a Monday Conference interview on November 1, .19 76 ,

the Leader of the Opposition thought it would be entirely  appropriate to have a combined half Senate and House of . representatives election at the ned of 1977 .  I quote the  cords he uttered almost, exactly a year ago:

"In a year’s time, which I would think would be about the  earliest that there could be an election, although  quite a likely time for the election, it would ,be a  perfectly reasonable time to have a half Senate election  and once could have the whole of the House of Representatives at the same time to synchronise the elections.

Mr Speaker,  if the elections are not held together it will mear ÃÂ¶)  that there must be an election for half the Senate at least by  May 19 78 ,  an. election for the House of Representatives before  April 1979, another election for half the Senate before July 1981

and so on -a major Federal election every one or two years.

A situation in. which a Government is constantly concerned with .   holding of elections is not conducive to sound Government and  hence is not in the public interest.  -If the elections for both Houses are to be synchronised, the question

arises as to when they should be held.  In practical terms,  this  means - should they be held in December this year, or before  the end of May next year? The Government has come to the

conclusion that the elections for both Houses should be held in  December 1977, and I have recommended accordingly to His ^ Excellency. .  .  w

Sir, it is appropriate that I should tell the House what  considerations have led the Government to this decision. ' At the time the Government was elected in December 1975, Aust"  was in a state of severe depression marked by rapid inflation.  W

rapidly rising unemployment,  and declining output.-  . Since that election, the Government has pursued policies designed  to correct the situation. These policies have required steady  and resolute action. There are now encouraging signs that they

are succeeding.  -  ... . . .

The economy is strengthening,  there is now indisputable evidence  that we are winning the fight against inflation.  Interest rates  are falling.  Investment is rising,  confidence is returning. The conditions under which real economic growth can proceed

are being restored.  The Government takes much satisfaction  from these encouraging developments.  "

Nevertheless, there is still much to be done.  The reduction in the  rate of inflation, the achievement of real economic growth and  the progressive reduction of unemployment which is a vital part  of the Government's goals can only be sustained by the continuance  of these policies. .

A fundamental requirement for their success is an atmosphere of  certainty'and confidence in the communityÃ¢ÂÂ  We have acted  firmly to ensure that confidence continues to return.  ‘  . To have further progress,  Australians must be convinced

that the current economic recovery6  will continue,  not just for months but for a number of years ahead.

While uncertainty as to an election persists,  investment is  likely to be held back, confidence could be eroded and a .  significant Ã¢ÂÂ   growth in employment opportunities is unlikely. All this is highly undesirable at a time when school leavers  will shortly be seeking to enter the workforce. An election in December will provide an early opportunity to

end election speculation and the resulting uncertainty. It will enable the Government to seek from the people an  expression of their will.  .

Mr Speaker,  let me also make clear that an election in December  would be Ã¢ÂÂ in keeping with the pattern over many years.  . for elections to be held for half the Senate in. the  latter months of the calendar year.

In fact,  December would be the usual time for the Senate election  to take place. Since 1949, and leaving aside double dissolutions  elections for half the Senate have been held in November or  December on seven occasions and in May on one occasions, only.

For the reasons I have stated, there is ample justification for  both elections to.be held together at this time. Mr Speaker ,  the timetable I have proposed to His Excellency is  as follows: Ã¢ÂÂ

Issue of writs 10 November 1977

Nominations close '  18 November 1977

Polling 10 December 1977 1

Return of writs on or before 8 February 1978.

His Excellency has agreed to communicate this timetable to the  State Governors with a view to adopting it for elections for  Senators in each of the States. When replies have been received  from the States, I shall inform the House.
