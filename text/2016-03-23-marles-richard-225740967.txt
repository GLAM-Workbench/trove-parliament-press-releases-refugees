THE HON RICHARD MARLES MP  SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND BORDER  PROTECTION   MEMBER FOR CORIO





Sixth Bali Process Ministerial Conference

Today, the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, Peter Dutton, and the  Foreign Minister, Julie Bishop, are representing Australia at the Sixth Bali Process  Ministerial Conference in Indonesia.

Since 2002, the Bali Process has provided a valuable forum to raise regional awareness  of the consequences of people smuggling, trafficking in persons and related  transnational crime.  It counts among its 48 members the United Nations High  Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) and the International Organisation for Migration  (IOM).

This meeting provides an opportunity for the Turnbull Government to engage with our  regional partners, and the UNHCR, to immediately secure proper third country  settlement options for refugees living in Nauru and Manus Island.

The nearly 2000 people living in these offshore processing centres have been left to  languish without any certainty for their future.  Australia must negotiate a credible third  country

option to resolve the fate of these people, and Mr Dutton and Ms Bishop have  the opportunity to start these negotiations  today.

Working with the UNHCR to seek their input about appropriate and viable third party  settlement arrangements would be a priority for a future Labor Government.  A future  Labor Government will also play a leadership role in building a regional humanitarian  framework in South East Asia to improve the situation of asylum seekers.

Without an urgent resolution this Government will be doing enormous damage to this  refugee population.
