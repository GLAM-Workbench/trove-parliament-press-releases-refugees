TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW - ABC NEWS BREAKFAST WITH MICHAEL  ROWLAND AND VIRGINIA TRIOLI

E & O E - PROOF ONLY



TRIOLI:                      We’re joined in the studio by Finance Minister and  spokesperson for the campaign, Senator Penny Wong. Senator Wong, good  morning.



WONG:                      Good morning to you both.



TRIOLI:                      On that point that Scott Morrison was making, about an  MOU possibly being signed in the next few days during the  caretaker period, technically speaking, that can’t happen,  can it?



WONG:                      Well, I think it’s interesting that the Coalition are continuing  to try and undermine this agreement and undermine these  arrangements which is all about trying to stop the flow of  people movement and to break the business model of the  people smugglers. I mean, on the one hand Scott Morrison  originally said they were going to support it and now all we  see is them undermining it. It’s clearly not in the national  interest.



TRIOLI:                      Let’s go to the point, though, can that happen during the  caretaker period or not? Do you plan for that to happen during the caretaker  period?



WONG:                      Well, if the MOU is finalised, yes it can. I mean, the point is  this has already been announced. We’ve had the Prime

Ministers of both nations publicly articulate the agreement  and set out the Prime Ministerial agreements so this is just  implementing something which has already been agreed.

TRIOLI:                      So it is going to go ahead, there will be some formal  signing during this caretaker period and you say that’ll be legitimate and valid?

WONG:                      Well, if it were to happen it is legitimate and valid. The  details of that are something Minister Burke is obviously in charge of.

ROWLAND:              In his interview with us Scott Morrison also said, from the  Liberal Party’s perspective, there are at least spaces for  4,000 people, if not considerably more, on Nauru. Is that a  realistic view?



WONG:                      Well, all I can say on this is that the Liberal Party’s position  continues to change. On the one hand they originally they  said they did want to support the PNG agreement, and now  they don’t. Now they’re talking about Nauru. But they’ve  made clear that there’s a cap on it which is clearly, clearly  not going to work as a disincentive for people to get on a  boat. And we know, really, over the last few years the Liberal  Party progressed very, very few steps from ‘stop the boats’  as a policy.



TRIOLI:                      Penny Wong, let’s talk about the interest rate cut that’s  expected today. There are low rates, which most  governments say they want and they insist that they keep  rates low for people who have mortgages, and then there  are alarmingly low rates. It’s true, isn’t it, that if rates are cut  again today that the RBA must be worried about the  economy. That just follows logically, otherwise they wouldn’t  be cutting.

WONG:                      Well, let’s understand a few things first. The first thing is  this: we’ve seen Joe Hockey out actually arguing against an  interest rate cut. It’s a pretty extraordinary position, saying to  Australian families: ‘I want you to pay more, I want you to  pay more on your mortgage’.



The second point I’d make is: you would probably recall  during the Howard and Costello years every time there was  an interest rate cut John Howard and Peter Costello would  say ‘this is a sign of great economic management’.

So it appears that the Liberal Party’s position is: interest rate  cuts under a Liberal Government are a sign of good  economic management, but interest rate cuts under a Labor  Government are something else. Well, I don’t agree with Joe  Hockey. It is the case, Virginia, that the economy is going  through a period of change. And low interest rates are a part  of managing that change. And that’s ultimately a matter for  the Reserve Bank. But I think for Joe Hockey to go out and  say to Australians, ‘you should pay more on your interest  rates,’ really shows how out of touch he is.

ROWLAND:              But low interest rates, as you well know as Finance  Minister, is a way of kick-starting the economy.

WONG:                      And the RBA and the Government have made clear we are  going through a significant transition in our economy. We’ve  got a resources boom that’s coming off. We’ve got growth  moderating in our major trading partner, China. We do have  to manage a transition. Monetary policy, i.e. interest rates, is  an important part of that, as is the Government’s budget  plans, which are to make sure we don’t chase revenue down  when growth is softening - unlike what Joe Hockey is  advocating, which is cuts to the bone.



TRIOLI:                      But then this is ultimately Joe Hockey’s point: if the  economy is struggling then rates are cut.

WONG:                      I think Joe Hockey’s point is he doesn’t want Australians to  have relief on their cost of living which is a pretty extraordinary thing for an  Opposition spokesperson to be saying.

TRIOLI:                      In another matter, a report obtained by The Daily  Telegraph, from the Department of Infrastructure and  Transport - according to that report, no new private sector  jobs were created in Western Sydney since 2006 and the  region is facing a jobs deficit of up to 500,000 places by  2051. Why have you not been able to create jobs in Western  Sydney?



WONG:                      Job creation is important which is why we have steered the  economy through the Global Financial Crisis and why we  see Australia having created nearly a million jobs in that  period. Having said that, of course there are regions which  are doing it much harder than others - Western Sydney is  one. There are other parts like in the northern suburbs of

Adelaide. These are regions which are finding it much harder  than other parts of Australia -

TRIOLI:                      But this is a region of no jobs growth for all of that period -

WONG:                      - to generate employment. But I’d make the point: what is  your plan for this? I mean, we know what the Opposition’s  plan is and that’s to cut harder. Well, if you cut harder into  jobs, health, services, education, you’re just going to drive  unemployment up. And it just reminds us yet again why the  Government’s taken the decision we’ve taken, when the  economy is softening, not to cut harder, particularly in the  current financial year.



ROWLAND:              It’s not a good way to win the hearts and minds of voters in  that clutch of critical marginal seats in Western Sydney  though... the fact that there’s been no private jobs since  2006.



WONG:                      And what I’d say to them is that Labor does put jobs growth  first. And you have to look at what is the alternative. The  alternative is deep cuts to services and deep cuts to the  budget which would simply drive unemployment up - that’s  what Tony Abbott is proposing.



TRIOLI:                      Well, that’s the Opposition, but let’s focus on what the  Government is proposing. And you’ve not disputed those  figures this morning, so we accept that that’s true, and no  new jobs created -



WONG:                      Well, no -



TRIOLI:                      - Or do you dispute those figures?



WONG:                      I haven’t read the report. I’ve read the reports of the report.  I am accepting that there are regions in Australia which are doing it tough,  absolutely.

TRIOLI:                      What’s your plan to create jobs then?



WONG:                      The first this is to run a sound budget and to run a sound  economy and to make sure you don’t -

TRIOLI:                      That’s not going so well so far, with cut after cut after cut to  expectations -

WONG:                      With respect, that’s not correct. I mean, let’s have a look  where Australia is placed. At a time when we’ve had millions  and millions of jobs lost overseas, I think it’s close to 28  million worldwide, together we have created a million jobs -  nearly a million jobs. Now, of course we want to do more, but  the question should be: how will you manage this transition  at a time when the economy is changing and is softening?  And it certainly isn’t the prescription that Tony Abbott’s  putting forward - cuts to the bone.



ROWLAND:              To a broader political question. Will the Labor Party be  preferencing the Greens?

WONG:                      Look, these are matters for the Party. I’m sure that these  negotiations will continue. But I would say this: the Greens, if  they are seriously going to suggest to their voters that they  want to put Tony Abbott in the Lodge, well, they should be  up front with people about that.



TRIOLI:                      And has Labor yet managed to find a candidate for the  New South Wales seat of Dobell held by the former ALP MP  Craig Thompson? We read in The Australian today that  you’re struggling to find someone to stand there?



WONG:                      Well, look, that’s a matter for the New South Wales branch  and I’m sure they’ll manage that process as they will need to.

TRIOLI:                      And you reckon you’ll get someone in the end?

WONG:                      I’m sure the New South Wales branch of the Party will  ensure we have a candidate in Dobell.

TRIOLI:                      We’ll leave it there, Penny Wong, thank you.

WONG:                      Good to speak with you.
