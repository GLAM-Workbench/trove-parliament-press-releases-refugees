MEDIA RELEASE *  THE S E N A T E

SENATOR ROBERT HILL SHADO W  MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS

13 February 1990

MYANMAR - AUSTRALIA'S RECORD DEPLORABLE

Addressing a seminar convened by the New South Wales Branch of  the Committee for Democracy in Burma, the Shadow Minister for  Foreign Affairs, Senator Robert Hill, described the Hawke  Government's record on Burma (Myanmar) as "deplorable."

"Much criticism has been made of Australia by other countries, by  Opposition groups in Burma, and by the Burmese community here.

"This criticism is well deserved.

"The Labor Government of Mr Hawke and Senator Evans while  professing to support the democratic forces in their struggle in  Burma, have by their actions and pronouncements aided and  comforted a regime against whom the people have no protection  other than international attention and condemnation.

"It consistently misread the situation, took damaging actions,   made inappropriate pronouncements, and, in short, has done  enormous harm to the democratic forces in Burma.

Senator Hill called on the Hawke Government to immediately:

1. Impress upon Rangoon the importance of respecting the rights  of its own people and in particular to be part of a concerted  international representation to achieve the release of  Opposition leaders Aung San Suu Kyi and U Tin Oo.

2. Impress upon the Burmese Government the need to have free and  fair Election on 27 May 1990 and to safeguard against vote  rigging and other irregularities.

In particular, the Australian Government should urge the  Burmese Government to allow independent observers to monitor  the May Election, and re-open the country to foreign  journalists, banned since July last year.

3. In concert with other interested parties, especially Japan,  the Australian Government should proceed to develop a plan  for Burma's immediate and long term developmental needs, and  be prepared to play a supportive role in it. However,  assistance must be predicated on free and fair elections and

significant improvements in the human rights situation.

WILL THE 27 MAY ELECTION IN BURMA BE FREE AND FATR?

Address by Senator Robert Hill  Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs

to the

COMMITTEE FOR DEMOCRACY IN BURMA

Sydney 13 February 1990

i

"WTT.T. THE 27 MAY ELECTION IN BURMA BE FREE AND FAIR?"

Mr Johnson, Dr Than Lwyn, Vice-Admiral Leach, members of the  Committee for Democracy in Burma, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you

for your kind invitation. It is one I am particularly happy to  take up as the situation in Burma (or Myanmar) is one which has  concerned me greatly. ,

I would like to thank those of you who have written to me and  sent newspaper articles and other materials on Burma on a regular  basis.  I am impressed by your commitment to the cause of

democracy in Burma and by your organisational ability. You have  certainly raised the level of public awareness about what is  happening in Burma. Unfortunately, a lot remains to be done as  that improvement was made from a very low base.

For this discussion, you ask the question: Will the 27 May  Election in Burma be free and fair?

I regret that, although a multi-party election in Burma is now  technically legal, Burma having on 31 March last year abolished  the law restricting the country to a one-Party Socialist system,  the signs indicate that this poll will not be free.

A quick canvas of the present situation reveals why.

1. Martial law is still in place in all but the Mandalay and  Sagaing areas. The State Law and Order Restoration Council  (SLORC), of General Saw Maung enforces with a vengeance, all  restrictions on speech, assembly, movement, demonstrations,  publication.

-  To quote Aung San Suu Kyi in an interview reported in the  Sydney Morning Herald on 18 March 1989, "How can you have free and fair elections in a country where there is no free  speech, no freedom of assembly, no freedom of the press and

no freedom from arrest?"

According to General Saw Maung, the restrictions will be

2

i

Ã¢ÂÂ  lifted three months before the election i.e. by 27 February.

We shall see in two weeks time whether he makes good on his  promise. -

Furthermore, although the lifting of martial law could be  welcome, it would not necessarily mean the end of

restrictions. The military take seriously their powers to

arrest, detain and otherwise intimidate under various  existing vaguely worded laws.

2. The most prominent Opposition leaders, the ones capable of  defeating military-supported candidates if the election is  free and fair, have all been removed by one means or another.

Aung San Suu Kyi, General Secretary of the National League  for Democracy (NLD) and to the Saw Maung Government, a more  dangerous threat as Aung San's daughter, has been under house  arrest since 20 July. She has just been disqualified from

standing for election on account that she is not registered  as a resident of Rangoon. NLD Chairman U Tin Oo is in jail  for daring to say that he did not think the coming Election  would be free and fair. The veteran former Prime Minister U

Nu is barred from standing because he refused to dissolve the  parallel government he formed last year.

3. The military has refused all calls to make way for the

formation of an Interim Government. The formation of an  Interim Government would have at least reduced the danger of

government manipulation, intimidation and other actions aimed  at influencing the outcome of the Election.

4. The military is firmly behind the National Unity Party (NUP),  which is the Burma Socialist Program Party (BSPP) by another

name, and will continue to work to ensure the success of NUP  candidates.

5. According to Amnesty International, extreme human rights

abuses continue. That does not create a climate conducive to  the holding of an Election genuinely free from fear and

I

3

intimidation.

6. The regime has so far refused to allow international

observers or foreign pressmen to be present during the ,  Election.

7. If the Top Secret minute of a 2 March 1989 SLORC meeting  presently in the hands of the Tribal Refugee Welfare group in  Western Australia is genuine, the Saw Maung regime never

intended to allow a free or fair Election as demonstrated by  the comprehensive strategy they have in place to infiltrate,  sabotage, spread rumours and otherwise minimise the  effectiveness of the Opposition parties.

8. Those deemed eligible to vote have been issued with "Special  Citizenship" certificates. Not deemed eligible are  "expatriates" like Indians and Chinese even though they and  their families may have lived in Burma for generations, or  those associated with "insurgents" like most ethnic  minorities and Communists.  What it means is that at least one

third of the population has been disenfranchised.

Why will the Saw Maung Government not allow the Election to be free and fair?

The short answer to this is that the ruling elite or the military does not want to relinquish power.

1. Power

The military has enjoyed power for a very long time. We must

bear in mind that Burma has been ruled by a single political  party, the BSPP, for 27 years. The BSPP was simply the  political arm of the Burmese Army, and behind both the BSPP

and the Burmese Army was Ne Win.

When the ruling elite and the military are inseparable there  is a formidable combination - an entrenched political network

4

(eg "People's Councils" throughout the country) backed by a  180,000-strong army.

2. Fruits of Power

The military has enjoyed the fruits of power for a very long  time. When corruption, nepotism and abuse of power is carried  out unchecked over a period of 27 years there are very deeply  entrenched interests.

For example, it is believed that some local military  commanders and local officials have been deeply involved with  the drug trade, gems or arms smuggling or illegal logging  operations. An estimated 60 to 70% of public servants are  military or ex-military personnel.

Those with vested interests fear cessation of income and  possible retribution from an elected government unsympathetic  to their situations.

3. Disintegration

The military believes that a civilian government would result  in a complete breakdown of law and order, leading to

dismemberment of Burma.  It is not surprising that they should  hold this belief, considering that the Burmese Army has since  1948 continuously fought both separatist-inclined hill tribes

and Communists.

If one were looking for something positive to say about the  upcoming Elections, it would be that they are being held at all.

I am told that whenever the word "Election" is mentioned, the  Burmese people will remind you that General Ne Win had promised

to hold an Election 27 years ago.

Could pressure have been brought to bear to MAKE the Election

free and fair?

I believe so, or at least, to create conditions favourable for

I'

such an Election to take place.  The critical time was just after  the coup of 18 September 1988, even though efforts should be made  at any time.

1. International pressure

It is true that the international community has very little  leverage with Burma - no complementary economies, no trade, no  contacts - a product of nearly 30 years of isolation.

But it does have some leverage arising from the fact that the  Burmese economy is bankrupt and Burma is desperate for aid.

There was a window of opportunity in the period immediately  following the 18 September coup. After six months of

bloodletting during which four changes of government took  place - General Ne Win replaced by the even more hated General  Sein Lwin; Sein Lwin by the sincere but tainted U Maung Maung;  and finally U Maung Maung by General Saw Maung - the Burmese  Government was in desperate straits.

The Opposition's and ordinary people's demands for multi-party  democracy were growing.  Political parties were mushrooming.  General Saw Maung had no choice but to recognise this and to

promise to hold free and fair multi-party elections.

The irony is that many outsiders believed that he meant it.  Perhaps many outsiders wanted to believe that he meant it and  so took him at his word.

On 23 September, or a few days after the coup, Aung San Suu

Kyi called on Australia to step up the pressure on the Saw

Maung regime to negotiate with the pro-democracy movement.

"... I hope the international community would be a bit

stronger about its protests. We would appreciate some moral

support from all directions. "

Unfortunately, that support was not forthcoming, certainly not

' .  5 -  ‘

6

in any substantial way and not from Australia.

It could have made a difference if there had been coordinated  international pressure on the Saw Maung regime to agree to an  Interim Government being formed during the period before the

Election. It is well known that the Government of the day

has the advantage of administrative control, influence, power,   -favours to call upon, which is why international efforts to  find a peace settlement in Cambodia have run into such a  logjam over the question of who should be in the Interim

Government.

Burma offered an opportunity for concerned countries to make a  principled stand.

Why then was international pressure not forthcoming?

Perhaps it had to do with the fact that Burma is a country  with great economic potential - forests of teak, precious

gems, minerals and a market of 40 million into which to put  consumer goods.

The US Government, to its credit did offer a lead.  Whatever  its previous relationship with the Burmese Government in the

days of Ne Win, this time the US would have no truck with the  Saw Maung Regime, said so, and backed up their words with  specific actions.

For example, in July last year the House of Representatives  allocated US$2 million to help Burmese students who had fled  to the Thai border. Compare this to the reaction of the  Australian Government. When questioned by Senator Vallentine

in the Senate on 27 November 1989 as to whether the Government  will urgently consider granting much needed humanitarian aid  to the students on the border, Senator Evans said, "The

Government would certainly give sympathetic consideration to  any request for aid which was clearly of an emergency and

humanitarian nature." As far as I know, such aid has not been  given.

7 /Ã¢ÂÂ ’

The US offered visas to students who wanted to go to the  United States although I understand that not many took up the  offer as they saw their place as being part of the struggle in  Burma.  On 20 April 1989 the US announced that Burma would be  dropped from the General System of Preferences (GSP) under

which Burmese goods could be imported into the US duty free.  The reason given was human rights.

So one or two countries have tried, but unfortunately, the  international community as a whole did not take a coordinated  or a particularly strong stand.

As Holly Burkhalter, the Washington Director of Human Rights  Watch observed, testifying before a sub-committee of the US  House of Representatives, '

"The deterioration of human rights in Burma demonstrates that  without sustained pressure from the international community,  governments have little reason to acknowledge the protests of  their own people or to fear the world's condemnation."

2. Australia's position

-  I have registered both in the Parliament and in press

statements the Liberal/National Coalition's great

disappointment with the actions of the Australian Government

under Mr Hawke and Senator Evans.

I am not the only one. Much criticism has been made of

Australia by other countries, by Opposition groups in Burma,  and by the Burmese community here.

1. Aid

Australia was one of the last to suspend its average $10

million a year aid programme after the September 1988 coup.  It

did so after Japan, the US and West Germany, the other three

aid donors.

8

It was the first to resume aid.

The Australian Government's decision to resume aid on the  Mandalay Dairy Project was premature.  Understandably, the  reaction amongst the democratic opposition elements was one of

anguish, betrayal and anger with Aung San Suu Kyi condemning  the move bitterly.

The budget papers state the reason for resumption of aid - "  ... in order to ensure, for technical reasons, that a major  earlier funding program would not be wasted."

This was at a time when the Saw Maung regime was continuing  with and carrying out more horrifying campaigns against its  own people.

Australia sent entirely the wrong signal to the Saw Maung  regime, undermined the position of the democratic opposition

and paved the way for resumption of aid by Japan, the biggest  aid donor. I might add that it also damaged Australia's claim  to be an upholder of human rights and made hollow its denial  that economic considerations dominate its stand on Burma  because it was precisely an economic reason that was given as  the reason for resuming the project.

2. Contacts

The US State Department, Amnesty International and Burmese  groups both within and outside Burma have expressed grave  disappointment at the links Australia quickly forged with the  Saw Maung regime. This is in contrast with other western

allies who limited contact with Rangoon officials.

Australia was the first western nation to accept the

credentials of the Saw Maung regime's nominee in Canberra.

Australia's representative in Burma made a diplomatic call on

the Saw Maung regime in November 1988 or just over a month  after the bloody coup, one of the first if .  not the first

9 1

Ambassadors to do so.

At a time grave repression was continuing, Australia was  pronouncing the situation in Burma as returning to normal, an  assessment that contrasted sharply with that of other  governments.

It is difficult to see what benefits Australia's quite  different position has brought to anyone other than the regime  in Rangoon.

3. Human Rights .  .

Human rights abuses have been amply documented in the last two

years by Amnesty International, Asia Watch and others groups.  Torture, "extrajudicial executions", forced labour and harsh  treatment have all been detailed.

While nobody is certain how many Burmese have been killed, it

is generally believed that the killings were on a far larger  scale than that carried out at Beijing last year, but,  unfortunately, without the same international outrage.

On 8 March 1989 the UN Human Rights Commission passed a  resolution expressing concern about the human rights situation  in Burma and urged the Government to ensure freedom for its

people. But the Commission does not have the power to force  Burma to comply. It depends on the leverage applied by the

international community.

In the case of Australia, that leverage was not applied. Not  surprisingly, the Hawke Government was criticised bitterly by

Aung San Suu Kyi who on 19 April said,

"I can't help wondering whether Australia's policy has more to

do with economic consideration rather than human rights and  desire for democracy. ... I say very frankly to the

Australians that I'm not very convinced that everything they

are doing is to support a great movement to democracy. There

10

are a lot of economic interests involved."

I find it curious that Senator Evans can tell an Amnesty

International meeting here in Sydney on 19 May that the  Australian Government would not allow political or commercial  relations to prevent it from making representations on human  rights issues, when events in Burma at least demonstrate the

opposite.

4. Government Statements

Australian Government representatives have made statements and  expressed opinions that benefited the Saw Maung regime, though  perhaps unintentionally so, to give them the benefit of the  doubt.

In his 25 July 1989 statement expressing the Australian  Government's "concern and regret" at the detention of Aung San  Suu Kyi on 20 July, the Foreign Minister nevertheless  amazingly said, "The Election Program has been adhered to." He

failed completely to mention that the real question was really  whether it would be a genuine election or one designed to give  a covering of legitimacy to the military regime. And the key  point, that the Saw Maung regime had completely refused to  hand over to an Interim Government, was not mentioned, nor the  military tribunals just set up which gave regional commanders

the power to ban witnesses from trials, sentence people to  death and carry out the sentences.

In a later statement to the Parliament on 4 December 1989, the  Foreign Minister said that the Saw Maung regime had not  invited Australia to send observers to the Election, and in  any case there was " a very serious question as to the value  of sending observers to determine the fairness of the election  process itself." This, incidentally, was something the

Parliamentary Amnesty group was urging him to support.

And there have been other statements by Australia's

representatives that reports of maltreatment of prisoners have

11

been exaggerated. This comment, as former Ambassador Garry

Woodard has pointed out,  was later used extensively by SLORC  for propaganda purposes.

One must not forget other ludicrous suggestions, including a  much publicised offer that Australia can help the Saw Muang  regime to conduct its Election by supplying cardboard ballot  boxes. I believe a gift of sample boxes was actually made.

Quite rightly, this suggestion was met with ridicule by  Opposition leaders including Aung San Suu Kyi herself.

The Labor Government of Mr Hawke and Senator Evans have not only  not assisted those in the bitter struggle in Burma, but by their

actions and pronouncements aided and comforted a regime against  whom the people have no protection other than international

attention and condemnation.  It consistently misread the  situation, took damaging actions, made inappropriate  pronouncements, and, in short, has done enormous harm to the  democratic forces in Burma.

FUTURE PROBLEMS

Political Problems

I see a period of continued difficulties ahead. If free and fair  elections are not allowed and the victor is the NUP (ie the  BSPP), we can expect more of the same, with aspirations for

democracy unsatisfied, possibly to surface in even more violent  form at a later date.

If the victor should be one of the political parties, either Aung

San Suu Kyi's NLD (without Aung San Suu Kyi) which is contesting

452 of the 492 constituencies (about the same as the NUP is  contesting), or U Aung Gyi's Union National Democracy Party, the

question is whether the winning party would have a leader of  enough stature and ability to re-build the nation and also

satisfy the military.

The question is also whether the other 200 or so political

12

parties will allow the winning party to govern without too much  political ferment.

Whatever the outcome of the 27 May election, statements from  SLORC indicate that the government to be formed will first exist  only to draw up a new Constitution to replace the one of 1974.  Transfer of power from the military would take place only after  the Constitution is ratified, a process that can take years. And

of course it remains to be seen whether any Constitution produced  by a government influenced or dominated by the military will be  an improvement over the present.

Economic Problems

Burma has been bankrupted by 30 years of economic mis-management.   It has massive debt problems with over $6 billion worth of  foreign debt. The sale of its Tokyo Embassy last month for $306  million or three times Burma's entire foreign currency reserve is

a measure of its desperation. There has been hardly any foreign  investment even though economic reforms and dismantling of the  state system took place in July 1988.

Burma presently has little capacity to earn foreign exchange. In  1988, it exported 40,000 tonnes of rice. Last year, it exported  none as there was a rice shortage within the country. This has to  be compared to the 2 million tonnes Burma exported in the last

year of the U Nu Government.

The world community will need to assist Burma, in the first  instance, through grants and soft loans to rebuild its productive  base.

Burma would also require tremendous assistance in education and  training.  We have to remember that schools have only just been

re-opened while universities are still closed and have been  closed for nearly two years. A whole generation of Burmans have

lost two years of education.

I;

13

A Divided Nation

The new Government will inherit the anger and bitterness,  especially over the last two years, that divide military and  civilians, students and military and politicians, hill tribes and  lowlanders.

Nation building will be a challenge.  Burma comprise ethnically,  linguistically, socially, culturally and historically different  peoples. It has over twenty major ethnic groups, 100 dialects,  half a million Indians and 200,000 Chinese, all of whom must be  accepted and integrated.

There is a definite need for a mediated end to the conflict  between Rangoon and the hill tribes with whom it has been at war  since 1948. Australia may have a role to play, but it is Thailand  who is best placed to fill the role of mediator.

On an optimistic note, the ethnic minorities no longer advocate  separatism, are prepared to negotiate, and want to be part of a  Federal system which gives them substantial autonomy.

Other Southeast Asian nations have faced the same difficulties  and have managed to overcome them. Thailand has both hill tribes  and ethnic Chinese minorities; Singapore's population comprise  Chinese, Malays and Indians; Indonesia's people converse in over

300 languages.

The one essential ingredient to their successful nation-building  has been political accommodation together with economic growth

and improvement in living standards.

Similar hill tribes living on the Thai side of the border have

been successfully integrated into the Thai economy, growing  market cash crops like coffee and cool-weather vegetables. This

has been achieved by a combination of government assistance and

suppression of the drug trade and smuggling.

The experience of other Southeast Asian countries is that

14

Communist insurgencies can be controlled and even defeated,

especially as China no longer provides the same level of support  to the regional communist parties.  The Communist Party of  Malaya's abandonment late last year of its policy of armed  struggle seems to have escaped press attention. Yet it was one of

the most significant regional developments to take place in  recent years.

Like the Communist Parties of Malaya and Thailand, the Burmese  Communist Party may well decline in threat to the point where it  may one day disband. This is especially the case if economic  growth is carried out together with an end to the drug trade on  which they depend.

Drugs and smuggling

Burma is the world's largest producer of opium with the drug  trade in the Golden Triangle largely controlled by ethnic  minorities or the Burmese Communist Party.

Peace with the hill tribes and/or Communists would mean for the  first time that the opium problem could be solved. Any solution  would require first international commitment to substantial aid.

To be successful, eradication programmes must be carried out in  conjunction with suitable political and developmental measures.

And of course, eradication of smuggling would result in a

considerable boost to the economy.

What can Australia do in the immediate future

1. Impress upon Rangoon the importance of respecting the rights

of its own people.

The Australian Government's statements and actions must not  be contradictory.  It must send consistent signals to the

Rangoon government - as it must to other countries like China

15 l

- that gross human rights abuses will not be tolerated.

In particular, concerted international representation should  be made to achieve the release of Aung San Suu Kyi and U Tin  Oo.

2. Impress upon the Burmese Government the need to have free and  fair Election and to safeguard against vote rigging and other  irregularities.

To this end, the Australian Government should urge the  Burmese Government to allow independent observers to monitor  the May Election, and re-open th,e country to foreign  journalists, banned since July last year. We know that we  have the support of at least one Government in this - a  resolution to this effect was passed by the US Congress in  August 1989.

3. In concert with other interested parties,  especially Japan,  the Australian Government should proceed to develop a plan  for Burma's immediate and long term developmental needs, and  be prepared to play a supportive role in it. However,  assistance must be predicated on free and fair elections and

significant improvements in the human rights situation.

Conclusion

It is said often that success is not without its costs. The  Burmese people have so far paid the costs without seeing the

success.

But that will change.  Events presently unfolding in Europe must  give pro-democracy groups everywhere new heart.  It seems that no

government, however inflexible, can withstand massive,  coordinated and sustained pressures from the people for long.

I feel hopeful that democracy will come to Burma, that Burma will

one day take its rightful position in the region, perhaps join

16

ASEAN.

I am concerned that change should come about in as peaceful a way  as possible. I have outlined to you my views on Burma and.what

the Australian Government should be doing in the short term and  in the long run.

It is of course my intention to be doing these things myself.  But  in the short term, in the next few months, bearing in mind that  our deadline is 27 May, we will just have to continue to urge the  Labor Government along the right path.
