A DANGEROUS START TO 2012

Posted on Wednesday, 25 January, 2012



A boat carrying 121 people, intercepted north of Christmas Island this morning, is further  evidence that the people smugglers are conducting their business as usual with three boat  arrivals in the first week of the new year, the Acting Shadow Minister for Immigration and  Citizenship and Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and Border Protection, Michael  Keenan said today.

"Labor must show some resolve, end their arms wide open policy and stop encouraging  people smugglers by taking away the product they have to sell. Julia Gillard and Labor  should have no higher priority this year than to finally tackle the border protection crisis they  have created.

"In what will soon be 15,000 unauthorised arrivals since Labor unwound the Coalition’s  proven policies and created this problem - it is time the Prime Minister adopts the solution  that we know works and that we’ve held for a decade.

"Offshore processing on Nauru, a return to temporary protection visas and turning the boats  back around when it is safe and appropriate to do so will let the people smugglers know that  Australia is again serious about stopping their illegal and vicious trade," Mr Keenan  concluded.
