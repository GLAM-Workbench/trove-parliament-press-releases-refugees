Urgent relief for Somalia

Australia will provide urgent relief assistance worth $3.5 million for people affected by drought  and conflict in Somalia, the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development, John Kerin, announced  today.

"The situation in Somalia continues to deteriorate. Malnutrition is rife. The lives of one and a half  million people are at risk, with hundreds of children dying daily," Mr Kerin said.

"Oose to one million refugees have fled Somalia and are relying on assistance from neighbouring  countries.

"United Nations Observers are already in place and the UN stands ready to deploy security  personnel in Somalia to facilitate the large scale distribution of humanitarian assistance. Such a  force will need the cooperation of the various factions in Somalia.

"The relief package includes Australian food aid worth $2 million and cash grants for the work of  international agencies and Australian non government organisations."

The grants have been allocated as follows:   " $2 million to CARE Australia for an emergency food aid package (including approximately  4,000 tonnes of Australian wheat) for Mogadishu and surrounding areas   " $400,000 to UNICEF Australia for health, water and sanitation and agricultural assistance  for 40,000 people in the Kismayo region

" $400,000 to World Vision Australia to assist 380,000 people in Mogadishu and the Lower  Juba region. Program includes wet feeding, basic medical care, seeds and tools and training of  community health workers

" $400,000 to the International Committee of the Red Cross for emergency food supplies, seeds  and tools, veterinary drugs, medical assistance and tracing services   " $100,000 to Australian Lutheran World Service for essential airlift support for NGOs  operating in Somalia

" $100,000 to Community Aid Abroad for seeds, tools and agricultural inputs for people in  southern Somalia   " $100,000 to the Archbishop of Sydney's Overseas Relief and Development Program to assist  vulnerable groups in Mogadishu and the Lower Juba region.
