12 October 2011

TRANSCRIPT OF THE HON. TONY ABBOTT MHR  INTERVIEW WITH NEIL MITCHELL,  RADIO 3AW, MELBOURNE

Subjects: Julia Gillard’s carbon tax; Migration Act amendment.

E&OE……………………….…………………………………………………………………

NEIL MITCHELL:

Good morning.

TONY ABBOTT:

G’day Neil.

NEIL MITCHELL:

We’re getting messages from some businesses already that they expect prices to go up even before the  carbon tax is imposed in July next year. Is that a possibility do you think?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well look, I don’t think it can be ruled out at all because obviously if you’re going to have very substantial  increases in your inputs the tendency is to put prices up in anticipation. There is no doubt that the price of  power is going to go up and up and up, eventually the price of transport is going to go up and up and up and  power and transport are embedded in the cost of everything.

NEIL MITCHELL:

What are the chances of an election before July next year, so this carbon tax is never actually imposed?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think there is a significant chance of that if this is such a fragile and impermanent and unstable looking  government. Now, in the end it’s in the hands of the Prime Minister, it’s in the hands of the parliament  whether there is an election, but anything can happen in a parliament like this.

NEIL MITCHELL:

There have been some mixed signals from the Opposition. Do you want an election now?

TONY ABBOTT:

I don’t think the carbon tax should be going through. I think that something as important as this should be  put to the people, a mandate should be secured and I certainly think there’s something fundamentally wrong  about a situation where the Prime Minister says one thing before an election to win votes and does the  opposite after an election to hold power. This betrayal, this fundamental betrayal, Neil, it is going to impact  on peoples’ cost of living and it is going to make their jobs less secure.

NEIL MITCHELL:

So unequivocally you will repeal it?

TONY ABBOTT:

Yes. We can, we will, we must repeal it because this is a bad tax which will permanently increase peoples’  costs of living and it will permanently put Australian manufacturing at a massive competitive disadvantage.  So if we want to keep the pressure off cost of living, if we want to give Australian manufacturers a fighting  chance on a level playing field we’ve got to get rid of this tax.

NEIL MITCHELL:

So if we do see prices going up in some areas in anticipation of the carbon tax is there anything we can do or  have we just got to cop it?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, the best thing is not to have the tax and that’s why I think it just so terribly disappointing, Neil, that 72  Labor members of parliament are likely to troop into the building in a few minutes time and break faith with  their electorates because when the Prime Minister said five days before the last election “there will be no  carbon tax under the government I lead” she was giving a commitment on behalf of every Labor member of  parliament. That commitment bound them all and they are now about to break faith with it.

NEIL MITCHELL:

One of your people, Sophie Mirabella, has been thrown out for 24 hours. I assume you’d rather she was  there. Has she done the wrong thing?

TONY ABBOTT:

I’d always prefer that my members were able to vote in the chamber. Look, this is a very passionate debate,  Neil. Sophie, as I understand it, was trying to table a petition of 1,200 constituents and she understandably  got very passionate. Now, I wish it hadn’t happened but when you’ve got a Prime Minister who wants to  introduce the biggest tax change in Australia’s history without a mandate, without honesty pre-election, you  can understand why people get pretty hot under the collar.

NEIL MITCHELL:

Ok, but you have been promised have you that the asylum seekers legislation won’t go through while she is  out of the house because they could sneak it through?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well look, and a lot of people understandably fear that that’s exactly what the Government will try to do.  For what it’s worth they’ve said they’re not going to do that. They’ve said that they’re going to deal with the  Migration Act tomorrow as planned.

NEIL MITCHELL:

Just one last thing on the prices which is worrying me. If you repeal the legislation and the price rises have  already gone through can you take them off?

TONY ABBOTT:

We can ensure that the ACCC is absolutely vigilant to make sure that businesses are doing the right thing by  their customers.

NEIL MITCHELL:

Thank you for your time. Opposition Leader Tony Abbott.
