Residential Housing Project  'golden cage'.  10th Jun 04

On the deadline for the release of children and their families from detention, Greens

Senator Kerry Nettle has slammed the Residential Housing Project in Port Augusta as  “suburban jail that imprisons women and children just like any other detention  centre.”

The 10th June deadline for release of families was set in the Human Rights and Equal  Opportunity Commission’s report “The Last Resort” issue s last month.

“Both Labor and Liberal support Residential Housing Projects as a way of deflecting  criticism for mandatory detention. The Greens recognise these detention camps for  what they are - prisons just like Baxter,” Senator Nettle said.

“I visited residents in Port Augusta Residential Housing Project and saw the prison-like conditions. One of the children described the Project as a ‘golden cage’ and  pleaded for her freedom.

“These women and children are treated like criminals - locked in a tiny compound,  under 24 hour surveillance, patrolled by guards with no access to the community.

“The Greens policy calls for a return to open reception centres like those used during  the 1980s.

“There is no excuse for locking up innocent human beings. Residential Housing  Projects lock women and children in a suburban jail.

“Both major parties need to show how they intend to return Australia’s immigration  policy to a humanitarian footing that treats asylum seekers like human beings.”   Contact Jon Edwards - 0428 213 146
