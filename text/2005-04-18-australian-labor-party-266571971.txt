Senator Kerry Oâ€™Brien  Shadow  Minister for Territories  18 April 2005



O'BRIEN VISITS CHRISTMAS ISLAND DETENTION  CENTRE - SAYS RELEASE THE CHILDREN FROM  BEHIND BARBED WIRE NOW

Today Senator Kerry O'Brien, Shadow Minister for Territories, visited the temporary  Immigration and Reception Processing Centre (IRPC) on Christmas Island to inspect the  facility and meet the detainees and staff.



Senator O'Brien said the visit to Australia's most remote immigration detention centre  reinforced his view that children should be brought out from behind the barbed wire.

"Thirty-five people, all Vietnamese nationals, are detained at the centre on Christmas  Island, including nine children.

"These detainees, including children, have been locked up for almost two years.

"It's time the government heeded Labor's call and stopped punishing children for their  parents' decision to seek asylum in Australia," Senator O'Brien said.

Senator O'Brien spoke with detainees about the circumstances of their detention.

He undertook to pursue a number of matters related to their detention upon his return to  the mainland next week.

Senator O'Brien said the detainees were concerned their plight was understood by all  Australians and were grateful for the kindness and consideration shown to them by the  Christmas Island community throughout their detention.

A future Federal Labor Government will remove children from behind the barbed wire,  return management of detention centres to the public sector and appoint a statutory  Inspector General of Detention.

Senator O'Brien visited the Christmas Island temporary IRPC as part of a visit to  Christmas Island and Cocos (Keeling) Islands - Australia's Indian Ocean Territories.
