Kerry Nettle, Senator for New South Wales



Six month Nauru deadline an impossible task - bring them to  Australia

19th Mar 07



Australian Greens Senator Kerry Nettle today said that it will prove impossible to process and

find third countries for the 83 Sri Lankans within the six month deadlines set by the Nauru

government and that they should be brought to Australia now rather than delay the inevitable.



“Given the current processing system and that the UNHCR will not take part in it, the

government will find it virtually impossible to assess and find third countries to take these 83

people,” said Senator Nettle.



“The Nauru government has shown more morality than the Australian government by setting

this deadline rather than leave refugees in limbo for years.



“Kevin Andrews will have to transfer a lot of departmental staff and assist the lawyers if he

expects to meet the deadline.  It would be far more humane, simpler and much less expensive

to bring them to Australia for processing.



“The defeat of the Designated Unauthorised Arrivals bill last year should have been a signal to

the government that offshore processing was no longer acceptable to the public or parliament.



“The six month deadline will expire just before the federal election. John Howard must realise

that this attempt to shirk our international responsibilities will come back to hurt him politically

at a vulnerable time."
