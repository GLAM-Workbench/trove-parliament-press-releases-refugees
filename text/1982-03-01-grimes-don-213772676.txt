CHANEY POSTPONES LEGISLATION ON PENSIONERS' INCOME

Senator Chaney announced last August in the Budget that the  Government would take into account in assessing pensions  the money held in pensioners' cheque accounts or other  non-interest bearing funds.

As the months passed and no bill was introduced some pensioners  became increasingly fearful that they could be penalised for  investing superannuation payments in one of the many funds  offered by banks and finance companies.  Others who sold

houses or other assets and had money lying idle for a short  time were afraid of a raid by the Social Security Department.

Because of these anxieties I pressed the Minister several  times to make his intentions clear to Parliament so that  pensioners would know where they stood.  On 25 March he finally

moved from 'this year,  next year'  to 'sometime..' and perhaps  'never'. It will, he said:  .

'depend on whether a satisfactory form of legislation  can be devised'.

The Opposition, when it drew attention to the uncertainty in  the electorate, was accused of trying to frighten pensioners.   But the fault is with the Government,  which announced a  serious legislative change when it had no idea how it would

go about it, so that popular papers could then indulge in  banner headlines like 'Pension Blitz:  Crackdown on Old Folks'.  (Sunday Telegraph 6.9.1981)

Senator Chaney has put off this change, but not dropped it.

It is not good enough.  Until the Government is definite about  its intentions, retired people will be unable to make proper  decisions about the best use they can make of their savings.

SOCIAL SERVICES AMENDMENT BILL REJECTED AGAIN *  I

On 24 March the Labor Party, Democrats and Senator Harradine  combined tp defeat for the third time the Bill which would  prohibit payment of benefit to the spouses of strikers, of unionists  stood down as the result of industrial action, and the alleged

'voluntarily unemployed'.

I quote from Senator Chaney's final speech -'We are ^dealing here with a situation where, by wilful act or  an act which is not the responsibility of the Government, an  individual has deprived himself of the ability to earn his

living for a period. In that circumstance it seems absolutely  artificial to have the spouse of that person exempted from the  equivalent of the income test..'

He knows,  but denied, that the people to be hurt by the bill could  have been anti-strike or stood down in another State. They would  not have performed a 'wilful act', but been victims of circumstances  and penalised only because they were trade unionists and their

families one-income families.

2 .

He knows,  but denied,  -that every spouse applying for an unemployment  or special benefit already has to pass an income test.

Senator Chaney promoted his Government's iniquitous legislation  with dishonest arguments. They were recognised as such by  a majority of Senators who rejected the Bill for the third time.  (Earlier comment on the legislation appeared in the October and  November 1981 issues of the Social Security Bulletin).

FRASER GOVERNMENT HOUSING PACKAGE - GAINS FOR THE WEALTHY

The Victorian Housing Minister, Mr Kennett, eagerly greeted  the announcement of the new housing policies:

1.. the Government1 1 s housing package would win the ' Victorian State election for the-Liberal Party'. (19.3.82)

That was certainly the Government's intention, and we predict  the Victorian electors will see through it. A careful look  at the proposals show them to be hastily contrived in the  interests of a minority of higher income earners.

The Sydney Morning Herald has said of it:

'.. its political benefit to the Government is doubtful,  its contribution to the solution of the housing problems  is doubtful; and its contribution to the good government  of the country is doubtful1.  (19.3.82)

The Government has authorised an increase in the interest rate  of 1%, making a 4% rise since 1978. It is estimated that the  4% rise has increased mortgage payments by $1,200 million.

To deflect public criticism and pacify the Victorian Government  in mid-election the following proposals, to cost $325 million  in a full year, were announced -(a) Tax Rebate

Recent and intending first home buyers will receive tax  rebates of $500 in the first year, $400 in the second year,  $300 in the third year, $200 in the fourth and $100 in the  fifth.

This will be increased by $200 if there are one or more  dependent children.

It will take $230 million of the $325 million allocated  and it will not be means tested.

A 1980 survey in Victoria showed that 45% of first home-  buyers earned in excess of 150% of average weekly earnings.  People in that income bracket are the wealthiest 9 % of  wage and salary earners.

The Government is therefore making an unconditional gift  of around $100 million to people who are among the richest  9% of home buyers.

3 .

One Government Member was shocked:

'I believe the first principle that should have been  applied to the rebate was a means test... We are  branching out into a new area of expenditure which is  not means-tested... I simply do not understand that,

in view of the demand and stringency of government  finances.' (R. Steele Hall, M.P. 18.3.1982)

.  Only 28% of home buyers will qualify for the rebate.

.  72% of home buyers will get nothing but higher interest rates.

(b) Home Savings Grant (Deposit Assistance Scheme)

Labor has consistently opposed this scheme on the grounds  that it directed scarce housing funds away from the needy.  Between 1976 and 1981 the value of the home to be purchased  was raised to $70,000 and the annual allocation for the

scheme increased from $15 million to $74 million.  Until now it has not been means tested and, according to  the Minister for Housing and Construction, information on  income levels was not even sought from Home Savings Grant

applicants. ÃÂ  ' Ã¢ÂÂ

The change announced on. 18 March will increase the grant  from $2,000 to $2,500, with an additional $500 for one  child and an additional $1,000 for two or more children. There will be no waiting period.

For the first time it will be means tested, starting at  130% of average weekly earnings, and tapering off until  it cuts out at 150% of average weekly earnings.

It will cost an additional $63 million this year, and  an extra $16 million in 1982-83.

(c) Housing Crisis Relief .

The Cinderella of the group is an allocation of $20 million  a year to begin in 1982-83 if it is matched by the States  on a dollar for dollar basis’^ which will assist low  income buyers experiencing extreme difficulty in meeting  their mortgage repayments and low income private renters

meeting their rental payments. It has not been worked  out with the States which will have the responsibility  for administration and funding.

The 'Age1  commented -'Those in the greatest housing need have missed out almost  altogether.. They are the bottom income groups who cannot  even aspire to buy homes and who have seen the lists for  public housing grow longer as both Federal and State  Governments cut back on funds'. (20.3.82)

There is no Commonwealth allocation in this package for public  housing, which has been cut from $789 million in 1974-75 to  $250 million this year. In the next five years the allocation  has been fixed at $200 million a year, a sum which will have  been diminished by 70% in its final year.

4 .

In Victoria alone, the target of these policies,  14,000 families  are on the waiting list for rental accommodation in the public  sector. Throughout Australia, 300,000 people are estimated to  be living in caravan parks because of the shortage of low cost

accommodation. .

Allowances for children

A remarkable feature of these housing proposals is that they  give the equivalent of family allowances to first home-buyers  while refusing to increase them for other.families.

Under the tax rebate scheme a family with children and buying  a first home receives an extra $4 a week.  Under the new  Home Savings Grant scheme a family with one child receives  an extra $10 a week, and if there are two or more children  an extra $20 a week.

The basis of a universal family allowance is destroyed when  such large additional amounts are given to home buyers who  already have substantial capital and are denied to families  who cannot afford to bridge the deposit gap and will never

have a home of their own.

Welfare in reverse

The taxes of the poor are going to subsidise tax rebates and  extra family allowances to middle and high income earners. The poor will also face rising rents because of increases  in interest rates. .

The $325 million housing election bribe has come in two  separate parcels -.  $305 million for the middle income earners and the rich;

.  $20 million next year for the poor who are private renters  and mortgagees if^ the States match the funds.

Sir Phillip Lynch, who has called for tougher means testing  of all social security payments, states that the housing policies

1  .. are a responsible and competitive package providing more significant levels of housing assistance to those who  need it most1.  (19.3.1982) Ã¢ÂÂ

Government members who believe social security payments should  go only to the needy but housing funds should go to the rich  are cynics, or hypocrites, or both.  .

$300,000 for advertising

The advertising campaign began within a week of the announcement,   ten days' before the Victorian election. The funds went disproportÂ­ ionately to Victoria which received 35% of the advertising budget  though it has only 26% of the population. The Government paid

for TV advertising of this housing package, though nine months Â·   ago Senator Chaney would not authorise TV ads for the disadvantaged  health care card, and two years ago Senator Guilfoyle said she  could not justify spending money on TV and radio to inform people  of theip rights to pensions and benefits.

THE P.A.D.P. SCHEME - REVIEW AND RECOMMENDATIONS

The Program of Aids for Disabled People (PADP) was one of the  Federal Government's few on-going initiatives for the International  Year of Disabled Persons. The Program was supposed to"increase  the independence of disabled people by providing aids and appliances

to those who were otherwise ineligible for assistance. It has done  so for the relatively lucky ones who were in the right place at  the right time. Many others have missed out because the money

ran out so soon and still others have not heard of PADP because  the publicity has been so poor. The scheme must be reviewed  and modified before it becomes just another part of the  bureaucratic structure ineffectually serving disabled people.

There have been many problems associated with the implementation  of PADP. The original starting date of 1 April 1981 came and  went while the Commonwealth and the States were still arguing  about administration.  Agreement had been reached with all but

South Australia and New South Wales by July and they were in the  scheme by early 1982. The net result has been not only confusion  and resentment among disabled people, but a dearth of feedback  about how PADP actually works.

In Victoria the Yooralla Society has prepared a review based  on nearly ten months' experience. According to the President, Dr G. Keys Smith,  there is general agreement that PADP is 'one  of the most important initiatives' for disabled people in recent .

years, but 'considerable disappointment'  in the way it is  operating in Victoria. In fact, throughout Australia the level  of disappointment is directly related to the high hopes that ' Were generated by the announcement of the Program.

The main problems can be summarised as inadequate funding,   complicated procedures,  restricted eligibility, lack of  guidelines and poor publicity. On top of all these, the  failure to monitor the scheme in a comprehensive fashion has

meant the loss of much data that would have been relevant for  future planning.

Inadequate funding VÂ»

Budget allocations which were originally $700,000 for three months  and then $2.4 million for a full year, have proved incapable of  meeting the demand. This is hardly surprising since the figures  were arrived at in the absence of basic statistics about disability

in Australia. '

Extensive consultation with disabled people's organisations could  have partly offset this, but such consultation did not take place.  The Government made a stab in the dark and came up with a gross  underestimate.

From the outset it was obvious that the funds would not go round  and issuing hospitals had to devise strategies for distribution.  Some committed their annual allocations in a few weeks on the  assumption that the few people who were going to benefit might  as well do so quickly. Others decided to spread the money over  as .many people and items as possible, sometimes combining this  approach with unofficial use of a means test.

6 .

Apart from those who arrived too late, people with seye^re  disabilities have been particularly frustrated. Many, like the  man needing a $4,000 wheelchair, have been told that their  request would absorb an undue proportion of funds and offered

instead a number of cheaper items. A serious weakness of the  scheme is that it does not accommodate expensive disabilities  and severely disabled individuals are still expected to resort  to charity or go without.

Complicated procedures

The Yooralla Society refers to PADP's 1  unnecessarily complicated1   procedures which affect both applicants and staff. In the course  of being assessed an applicant may be involved in considerable  running around which is not only costly and time-consuming,  but exhausting. Furthermore,  since prescribing is restricted

to members of the medical profession they have to be involved  in assessment, even when the more appropriate specialist is  an occupational therapist or physiotherapist.

In fact, the concentration of assessment in the hands of doctors  and hospitals is an aspect of the scheme that disabled people  dislike. They see it as evidence of the Government's failure  to understand the difference between illness and disability.

They maintain that the very prospect of another medical assessment  can be traumatic to a person whose condition is stable, particularly  when the real expert in aids to daily living is often an  occupational therapist or a physiotherapist.

Restricted eligibility

The present eligibility criteria for PADP exclude people in  hospitals and nursing homes unless the aid or appliance is  required in connection with discharge. This in effect means  writing off all the disabled people who have to live in nursing

homes because of the severity of their disabilities. Since most  of them are pensioners and unable to purchase their own aids,  exclusion -from PADP compounds their problems of learning to  be independent enough to contemplate discharge - virtually a  Catch 22.

Lack of guidelines .

\ .

Beyond observing the main eligibility requirements:  that the disability is of permanent duration and the person ineligible  for assistance elsewhere, the issuing authorities in the States  are free to establish their own priorities.  This means

arbitrary decision-making and inevitably leads to unequal  treatment for. applicants. Whether an individual obtains what  he or she needs can depend on the hospital approached.

The inadequacy of funding, combined with the lack of guidelines,  has meant that clients of PADP are still objects of charity  rather than citizens with rights. When it comes to the crunch  they are dependent on the values of individual members of the

medical profession and there is no court of appeal. .

7 .

Poor publicity

Despite assurances that there would be wide publicity for PADP, this has not eventuated. Official information has been virtually restricted to doctors and hospitals and disabled people have heard through informal networks or not at all. For non-English

speakers,  the problems are doubled. Especially in the light of the $300,000 advertising budget for the new housing package, the poor publicity for PADP looks like a strategy for conserving funds

What needs to be done

(a) Increased funding Although $2.4 million has proved grossly  inadequate,  the failure to collect information about the needs  that could not be met has complicated the difficulty of  establishing more realistic funding.  However, the information  becoming available from the 1981 ABS Survey of Handicapped

Persons should make it possible to devise a formula for funding  that is statistically based.  PADP allocations must no longer  be guesswork, because every disabled person who comes within  the terms of eligibility has a right to be considered for  assistance.

(b) Extension of eligibility Disabled people who live in  nursing homes should not be automatically excluded from PADP. They should have theÂ·right to be assessed as individuals though  the aid may not lead directly to discharge.

(c) Streamlining procedures Serious attention should be given  to streamlining procedures in the interests of applicants and  staff.  The number of interviews and the number of highly trained  staff involved should be kept to a minimum and greater use made  of expertise in community health and independent living centres. A proportion of the budget should go to publicity based on an

outreach concept and special regard paid to the problems of  non-English speakers.

(d) Uniform guidelines The criteria for prescription should be  uniform across all issuing authorities and only a small area left  for discretion. Over the next year guidelines should be developed  on the basis of comprehensive monitoring, with extensive input from

disabled peoples' organisations.

SENATOR CHANEY TRIES TO HELP THE VICTORIAN LIBERALS

In a stratagem to win the pensioner vote, pensioners' cheques in  Victoria - and only, in Victoria - came with a slip of paper  advertising a booklet giving details of benefits provided by  the Victorian Liberal Government.  Senator Chaney and his top

officials used the facilities of the Social Security Department  to top up Liberal propaganda.  As Senator Chaney still claims it  was a routine practice and there was no political involvement,  we  believe the following questions deserve answers -

.  why was it sent out only in Victoria?  .  why did it contain not only present assistance but election promise  .  why was the booklet the only one of its kind in propaganda style  and be signed 'Lindsay Thompson,  Premier and Treasurer'?

.  why was it sent out in the week before the Victorian election? .  why did he.approve the inclusion of Victorian-produced election  material on 12 March with Commonwealth pensioners' cheques?

I doubt that many people will accept Senator Chaney's protestations  of innocence. Ã¢ÂÂ   '
