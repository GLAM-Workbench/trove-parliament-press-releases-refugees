Minister must release interim report into Manus Island attacks

The Australian Greens are today calling on Minister Scott Morrison to release the interim report into  the Manus Island incident following the release new video footage, which shows Papua New  Guinean guards attacking asylum seekers just 24 hours before the tragic death of Reza Barati.

“This footage shows that guards, paid for by Australian taxpayers, attacked asylum seekers inside  the camp just 24 hours before Reza Barati was killed,” Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.

“What did the Minister know of this and what did his departmental staff at the camp do to prevent it  from happening again?

“Local PNG staff violently attacking asylum seekers should have sent alarm bells ringing, but instead,  violence escalated and a young man was killed.

“The interim report has been sitting on the Minister's desk for weeks. It's time he released it.    “The Abbott Government's desperation to cover up the incident that occurred on their watch gives  little confidence that the Manus Island gulag will improve.

“The footage puts in to question the actions of the Abbott Government just hours before the deadly  attacks and raises further doubt over why the Minister initially blamed asylum seekers for the  attacks.

“It is clear that the Minister knew more than he is letting on, making the established Parliamentary  inquiry into the incident more important than ever.

“Submissions are now open to the inquiry, giving Australian staff that worked in the centre at the  time of the incident the cover of parliamentary privilege allowing them to speak out and tell the  truth.   “I urge all those who witnessed the events to come forward and ensure that this horrific incident is  not simply swept under the carpet.”
