PRESS STATMJENT BY THE DEFARTMBNT OF ITr^`'+TIGRATION

All aliens in Australia will be required during the month

of September to notify the Commonwealth Department of Immigration

of their address, occupation and marital status.

An alien is a person who is not an Australian citizen,

a British subject, an Irish citizen or a British or Australian

protected person.

Visitors who are living in Australia for 12 months or

less are exempt from the notification requirement.

The requirement to notify the Department is a provision

of the Aliens Act. Failure to comply with the law could mean

prosecution with a penalty of a $100 fine or imprisonment for three months.

To make compliance easier for aliens the Department of

Immigration again this year will send out reply-paid notification forms to all aliens on the Department's registers.

Any alien who does not receive a notification form will

be able to get one from money order post offices or offices of the Department of Immigration.

Aliens will be reminded of their obligation under the Act by a nation-wide advertising campaign next month in newspapers, including the foreign press, and by announcements on radio. Posters in six languages will be widely displayed.
