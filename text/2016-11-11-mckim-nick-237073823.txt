Media Release: Mr Turnbull, Bring Them Here

November 11, 2016

The federal government should be resettling people detained in camps on Manus Island and  Nauru in Australia.



"Of course our hearts would lift to see people out of the camps, but they are Australia's  responsibility and should be brought here," Greens Immigration spokesperson Senator Nick  McKim said.



"Reports of a deal with the US lack any detail whatsoever, but the idea of sending Muslim  refugees to Donald Trump's USA raises some concerns."



"We also have no idea what would happen to people detained in the camps who have not been  found to be genuine refugees."



"We need more detail from the government, but the safest and most durable solution is to bring  every single person currently detained in camps on Manus Island and Nauru here to Australia."
