KARL STEFANOVIC:

Good morning to you, Tone.

TONY ABBOTT:

Morning Karl.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

First up this morning the Productivity Commission has finally released its report on reducing carbon  emissions. ItÃ¢ÂÂs backed the GovernmentÃ¢ÂÂs market-based approach. What were your thoughts when you saw  those results yesterday?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, the best compensation is not to have a tax. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs the best compensation. Just donÃ¢ÂÂt have the tax in the  first place. The other point, Karl, is that the Productivity Commission has made it very clear that no  competitor country to Australia, no coal exporter for instance, is going to have an economy-wide carbon tax  or an economy-wide emissions trading scheme. So what the Productivity Commission has said is that this is  a go-it-alone tax for Australia and itÃ¢ÂÂs a tax that will raise our cost of living and will reduce the  competitiveness of our export industries.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

What about renewable energy schemes as a result of this report?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, weÃ¢ÂÂre all in favour of renewable energy but…

KARL STEFANOVIC:

Because it says, as you know, as a result of this that theyÃ¢ÂÂre a complete waste of time.

TONY ABBOTT:

The point is in the end you canÃ¢ÂÂt do without coal. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs the point and the carbon tax ultimately spells death  for the coal industry which is why other coal countries arenÃ¢ÂÂt having a carbon tax.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

This morning The Daily Telegraph reports that the upper limit of the carbon tax compensation could be  raised to upwards of around $170, 000. Your response to that?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well Karl, as I said, the best compensation is not to have a tax in the first place. If you donÃ¢ÂÂt have the tax,  you donÃ¢ÂÂt need the compensation and, in the end, this is a great big money-go-round. As far as the  GovernmentÃ¢ÂÂs concerned what they really want is a giant political slush fund for redistribution purposes and  I think the public are seeing through this Government.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

You would know also though that the public may be more compelled to listen to the argument if theyÃ¢ÂÂre  getting more compensation.

TONY ABBOTT:

But, again, why would you believe this Government when it comes to compensation? The compensation  will be temporary, the tax will be permanent and letÃ¢ÂÂs not forget this is the Prime Minister who said six days  before the last election, “there will be no carbon tax under the Government I lead.”

KARL STEFANOVIC:

$170,000 threshold though, does it make your job more difficult?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, again, IÃ¢ÂÂll believe it when I see it and even when I see it I donÃ¢ÂÂt believe itÃ¢ÂÂll last. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs the whole  problem with this Government. You canÃ¢ÂÂt trust them.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

Alright, the Sydney Morning Herald reports this morning that Tony Windsor is set to back the plan, the  GovernmentÃ¢ÂÂs plan. Is that is any great surprise to you?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, Tony Windsor has basically been a supporter of the Government since the election. I think that he  canÃ¢ÂÂt say based on the Productivity Commission report that comparable countries are going ahead with a  carbon tax because no coal-producing country is going ahead. The Chinese arenÃ¢ÂÂt going ahead with one, the  Americans arenÃ¢ÂÂt going ahead with one, the Indians arenÃ¢ÂÂt going ahead with one. The Chinese plan to boost  their emissions by 500 per cent over the next decade, the Indians will boost their emissions by 350 per cent  over the next decade. So really what the Productivity Commission confirms is that this carbon tax is bad for  jobs and bad for our standard of living.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

LetÃ¢ÂÂs talk about cattle now, which has been a very serious issue and very well highlighted by Four Corners  earlier in the week. WhatÃ¢ÂÂs wrong with picking up the phone and calling Indonesian authorities, even our  Prime Minister calling the equivalent and saying, Ã¢ÂÂlisten, letÃ¢ÂÂs sort this outÃ¢ÂÂ?

TONY ABBOTT:

Completely agree. The Prime Minister wonÃ¢ÂÂt pick up the phone to the President of Nauru, she wonÃ¢ÂÂt pick up  the phone to the President of Indonesia, she wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt pick up the phone to the Prime Minister of PNG. I  mean, this is a prime minister who loves making announcements but wonÃ¢ÂÂt do the work.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

Would you think about picking up the phone and calling, would you have any impact?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, IÃ¢ÂÂm going to Nauru as you know on the weekend to make sure that it is possible to send boat people to  Nauru.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

In relation to the cattle exports first.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, IÃ¢ÂÂm not the prime minister. If I was the prime minister I would sort this out because itÃ¢ÂÂs absolutely  wrong to send Australian cattle to centres that donÃ¢ÂÂt have proper animal welfare measures in place but  thereÃ¢ÂÂs no point destroying a perfectly good export business while there are centres that we could send cattle  to that have these measures in place.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

The issue is, this is not going to be the last one, you can guarantee it that there are going to be more of these  and itÃ¢ÂÂs probably been going on for many, many years, probably when you were in government as well and  thatÃ¢ÂÂs the reality of it.

TONY ABBOTT:

And we took appropriate action. This has been a complete stuff up by a Government which is utterly  incompetent. They must have known this was happening. If they didnÃ¢ÂÂt know it was happening, surely the  Four Corners report would have alerted the Government to it. They should have been ready to go with a  proper response as soon as that report went to air.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

How long would it take you to solve it if you were in government now?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well look…

KARL STEFANOVIC:

ItÃ¢ÂÂs not easy.

TONY ABBOTT:

IÃ¢ÂÂm not in government, Karl, but the fact of the matter is it should never have come to this and we should not  destroy this important industry because it ought to be possible to keep exporting to centres that do treat  animals humanely while absolutely refusing to send our cattle to centres that donÃ¢ÂÂt.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

Just finally, Bob Katter also made news this week, launching his own political party. Is it true that you asked  him to join the Liberal Party?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well IÃ¢ÂÂve said the Liberal National Party is an excellent party and itÃ¢ÂÂs a new party and itÃ¢ÂÂs very different  from the party that he left a few years ago and I would welcome Bob with open arms, hat and all.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

He can be a bit of pain to be behind at the airport, let me tell you. All those belt buckles and what not. Just  quickly before we go, the Dalai Lama, I met him yesterday. HeÃ¢ÂÂs serene and Zen-like.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, weÃ¢ÂÂll get on well wonÃ¢ÂÂt we?

KARL STEFANOVIC:

He can consult with you about many things. I did tell him…

TONY ABBOTT:

We could give each other meditation tips.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

Right! I think you two are two peas in a pod.

TONY ABBOTT:

Perhaps he can talk to me about the meditation and IÃ¢ÂÂll talk to him about the bike riding.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

Right. Do you have a lame gag?

TONY ABBOTT:

I have many lame gags but none that IÃ¢ÂÂm going to try on you now, Karl!

KARL STEFANOVIC:

Alright. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs disappointing though `cause IÃ¢ÂÂm the only one to have asked the Dalai Lama a lame gag, it  seems, in the history of the world.

Thanks Tone, have a great week.

TONY ABBOTT:

Good on you Karl.
