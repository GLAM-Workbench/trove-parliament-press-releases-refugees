RAY HADLEY:

Tony, G’day.

TONY ABBOTT:

G’day Ray.

RAY HADLEY:

Well, $4.80 Ted Baillieu was with bookmakers on Friday afternoon. Luxurious odds in a two-man race.

TONY ABBOTT:

They were good odds and I hope some smart punters picked them up.

RAY HADLEY:

Did you expect what transpired to happen?

TONY ABBOTT:

I thought if there was any justice in the world it would happen because the Victorian Government has  basically been coasting for years. I always thought that the reputation of the Bracks and Brumby  Government was overblown and it was far more due to the good work of Jeff Kennett than it was to  anything that they’d initiated. Even now the Victorian Labor Government is opening projects and claiming  credit for things that were initiated in Jeff Kennett’s time. I suppose you could say in their defence that they  didn’t muck things up quite as badly as Bob Carr mucked things up after Nick Greiner and John Fahey for  instance. But, look, they were a typical Labor Government that were kind of all spin and not much substance  and I think the public are now seeing through this and I think that Labor’s brand is becoming toxic  everywhere because Labor’s style is becoming more obvious everywhere and people don’t like it.

RAY HADLEY:

Andrew Bolt appeared on the ABC programme The Insiders yesterday and I was reminded by his comments  that over the past couple of years after the loss of that federal election the most senior conservative politician  in the country I think was the Lord Mayor of Brisbane. Now since then we’ve had a win in Western  Australia for your party, we’ve had a win in Victoria, they’ll be routed - although there’d be another word  you could use in New South Wales close to that - by March of next year and that could follow Anna Bligh’s  demise the year after that in Queensland. Things may be very different in 18 months time.

TONY ABBOTT:

Quite possible and let’s not also forget that in the South Australian election earlier this year the Coalition got  52 per cent of the two-party preferred vote. I think there was an eight per cent swing against Labor there,  and there was actually a 12 per cent swing against Labor in Tasmania although Labor were able to form a  minority government with the Greens. I mean, this is part of Labor’s problem. It’s now a Labor-Green  alliance right around the country and that’s both energising the Coalition and it’s disconcerting a lot of  Labor people who feel deeply antagonised by what they thought was once the workers’ party but now seems  to be more interested in pandering to Green obsessions that it does in protecting the jobs of workers in  traditional industries.

RAY HADLEY:

I’ve made the comment a number of times that, you know, there’s a Coalition, the Nationals and Liberals,  and to a certain extent the fundraising arm of the Labor Party’s been the union movement. In light of what  was published in The Sunday Telegraph yesterday about the ETU and Bernie Riordan, do you think the  union movement is becoming a little resentful that there’s a third person in their bed?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, that’s an interesting question, Ray. I mean, all I saw from that piece was that there’s just a lot of  unhappiness inside the Labor Party with the current direction of Labor governments, whether it be the  Keneally Government in New South Wales or the Gillard Government in Canberra. I thought the interesting  thing yesterday from a federal perspective was the continuing spat between Kevin Rudd and Paul Howes  and plainly Paul Howes was a key figure in the demise of the former prime minister and both the former  prime minister and the current union leader want to keep the fight going.

RAY HADLEY:

Well, that was with Laurie Oakes on the Nine Network and he left no-one guessing how he felt about Howes  and, I mean, Howes appears to be one of those… I mean at the moment he’s very much into selling books  by the look of it because he spends a lot of his time promoting the book that he wrote and that was part of  the discussion yesterday. But Howes appears to be - and a lot of people resent this even if we allow for the  Greens being in that bed with the two other people - they resent the fact that to a certain extent the union is  still the power base; that people with connections be it Arbib, now directly in parliament, or Howes not in  parliament have some direct effect on what happens from the duly elected parliamentary representatives.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well I think that’s a good point, Ray. I think a lot of people wonder why one particular section - the union  movement - owns and operates its own political party and, as the unions have got weaker in the wider  community, it’s almost as if they’ve got stronger inside the Labor party and I think a lot of people resent that  but in the end what matters is can a government deliver. And that’s the problem with these Labor  governments, I mean the fundamental problem is that they just can’t deliver and I see the Prime Minister this  morning was making a speech, talking about her bucket list, you know, what she’s going to do to decide and  deliver in the coming year. Well, I mean, really and truly, what about 2008 when they didn’t decide or

deliver, or 2009, or 2010 when they didn’t decide or deliver? I think this is becoming all too typical; that to  distract attention from the disasters of the past and present they weave this mighty picture about what  they’re going to do in the future but I think people are increasingly unconvinced by this. It just looks like a  con job.

RAY HADLEY:

Why have you been bullying Ms Maclaren-Jones, the President of the New South Wales Liberal Party?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, look, I saw that headline and I just think it’s not true.

RAY HADLEY:

Well, to be… Who is Miss Maclaren-Jones? I mean, she’s obviously the president. I know she’s the  President of the Party but how does she get elevated to that status? I’d never heard of her, with all due  respect to her.

TONY ABBOTT:

Yeah, well Ray, look, she’s at the apex of the party organisation and I think that along with everyone else in  the party organisation she did a pretty fair job but I always think that we can improve and that’s what I’m  trying to ensure we do all the time.

RAY HADLEY:

Well that, the basis of the story is, by Mark Metherell, is that you’re not happy and nor is Barry O’Farrell as  he leads into an election with their handling of what happened in New South Wales leading up to the last  federal election; that if they had have done better, you’d now be the Prime Minister. It was that close, of  course.

TONY ABBOTT:

Yeah, it certainly was close but, look, I’m trying not to cry over spilt milk. I’m trying to get on with the job  Ray, and that’s why I’m going to Penrith tonight to listen to people and I guess also to give people some  more insights into how things would be different and better were the Coalition to be in government in  Canberra. I had a kind of a community forum in Beenleigh in Brisbane a couple of weeks back. I’ll have  another one in Darwin in a couple of weeks time and there’s this one in Penrith tonight at the Penrith RSL  club, and I just think that it’s very important that people understand that at least one side of politics is  prepared to listen to them and wants to talk about what’s important to them.

RAY HADLEY:

We will have the first part of this NBN legislation through in an hour and half from now, or just a bit over  that, in relation to breaking up Telstra. Have you been aware of this report that appears in the Fairfax press  today, about this study prepared by the British telecommunication consultants, Robert Kenny and Charles  Kenny, from the US Centre for Global Development, where it appears that our former Prime Minister was a  little loose with the truth when he said in 2009, of the broadband network, that 78 per cent of the  productivity gains in service business of 85 per cent in manufacturing flowed from information  communications, when it turned out the two papers involved from the Australian communications  department referred to gains of between 59 and 78 per cent and between 65 and 85 per cent. So, he took the  high ground, not the middle ground.

TONY ABBOTT:

And it also covered periods 1985 to 2001 and 1984 to 2002, so (a) the research wasn’t entirely accurately  presented and (b) it was very old research. Now everyone, Ray, wants better broadband. The question is,  should the Federal Government be spending $40 or $50 billion of ultimately tax payers’ money to put wires  into every household when we’ve got clogged roads, we’ve got railways that aren’t working properly, we’ve  got hospitals that aren’t functioning properly. Look, I certainly want my computer to work effectively, but  I’m far from convinced that the people in western Sydney for instance think that putting a wire into their  house so that their computer is chained to the wall, so to speak, is more important than fixing up the  transport mess.

RAY HADLEY:

Hear, hear to that. One final thing before you leave, the other problem apart from the ETS and the mining  tax that the Prime Minister was going to fix prior to the last election, leading into it, was of course boat  people. It appears these days, The Australian is the only one that tells me too much about it, the Herald  sometimes, it’s ignored by the Telegraph, it’s so much part of our life now, but another three boatloads have  arrived since Thursday, another 100 people and you talk about the cost. I get emails every day. How much,  we talk about per person will it cost us every time one of these people arrives, let alone the poor buggers in  some UN camp in another part of the world who get pushed further down the pecking order because we  accept these people as being refugees, not economic refugees, and still no action from the Prime Minister  and the reason there’s no action is because apart from me and a few others that whinge about it continually,  there doesn’t appear to be too many people concerned about it.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, Ray, certainly Scott Morrison and the Coalition are doing what we can to alert people to this problem.

RAY HADLEY:

But that’s how we find out, they now arrive on Thursday night, the first it’s reported it on Monday morning.

TONY ABBOTT:

Exactly right. It’s almost again like there’s being media management techniques applied here, but look, Ray,  the basic problem is we’ve got to stop the boats and if we can’t stop the boats the numbers in detention will  swell indefinitely and it’s just wrong. It’s just wrong. Now, I’m not saying that it’s easy, but the test of the  Government is controlling its own borders. The Howard Government passed the test, the Rudd-Gillard  Government failed the test and as long as they can’t stop the boats we will be opening more and more of  these detention centres, there’ll be a detention centre coming to an under-utilised military base near you and  I can very much understand why the public are increasingly anxious about this because it’s almost like our  country has lost control of its immigration programme, it’s been sub-contracted out to people smugglers and  it’s symptomatic of this Government’s failures and I notice one thing the Prime Minister didn’t mention in  her speech this morning was a regional processing centre because, you know, that’s sort of deader than  Julius Caesar that one.

RAY HADLEY:

It’s gone. By the way, I’ll be having a discussion with the environmental editor of The Australian in the next  half hour, Graham Lloyd. A big issue I think on the horizon: wind farms. It appears to me, if you think  there’s been smokes and mirrors with the so-called carbon tax and the climate change alarmists, what until  you hear about what Graham’s found out about wind farms and the effectiveness of getting any power back  into the grid from wind farms

TONY ABBOTT:

There’s a place for renewable energy, no doubt about that, Ray, but look, this idea that somehow we are  going to power our cities and towns through wind farms when the wind doesn’t always blow or even  through solar when the sun doesn’t always shine or even through tidal when there’s a change of the tides, I  mean, we need baseload power and, except for nuclear which the environmental movement doesn’t want to  discuss, that leaves us with coal fired power for the foreseeable future and we just shouldn’t pretend  otherwise.

RAY HADLEY:

Thanks for your time.

TONY ABBOTT:

Thanks Ray.
