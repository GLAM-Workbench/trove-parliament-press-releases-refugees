Press Statement No.  19 June 1975

VIETNAMESE REFUGEES

.  The Prime Minister, Mr Whitlam, announced today that a total of 201 Vietnamese refugees will arrive in Sydney Â·  . from Hong Kong tomorrow. Mr Whitlam said this would be the . largest single group of Vietnamese refugees to leave'Hong Kong

for any country to. date. The Prime Minister said that .

almost all^those coming to Australia were unlikely to have  been offered resettlement in other countries and for this ... reason their cases had received special consideration.

.  Mr Whitlam said that 126 of the refugees, were  adults, 65 were children and 10 were infants under two years  of age. There were 35 family groups and 6 single persons. .One-third of the family units were incomplete and almost

all were without close relatives here or in any other  refugee-receiving country to help them. Most were semi-skilled  or unskilled workers. Others were students without vocational  training. The medical condition of most of the refugees was  quite good. They had been given the usual migrant medical

examinations and x-rays. After their arrival in Sydney, all Â· the refugees will go directly to East Hills Migrant Hostel, . where special arrangements had been made to receive them.

Mr Whitlam said that selection and approval for -

entry of this group of refugees had been made because of '

Australia's commitment to take her fair share of refugees  from Vietnam. Mr Whitlam said the Government continued to be  in contact with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner  for Refugees and would keep the position of refugees under  review.
