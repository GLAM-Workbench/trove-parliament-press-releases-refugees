Border Protection Command intercepts vessels  12 June 2010

ACV Triton, operating under the control of Border Protection Command, today intercepted a  suspected illegal entry vessel north west of Ashmore Islands.

Initial indications suggest there are 59 passengers and 5 crew on board.

Just before midnight HMAS Larrakia, operating under the control of Border Protection  Command, intercepted a suspected irregular entry vessel north of Christmas Island.

Initial indications suggest there are 51 passengers and four crew on board that vessel.

Both groups will be transferred to Christmas Island where they will undergo identity, security  and health checks and their reasons for travel will be established.

While their nationality is yet to be confirmed, if these asylum seekers are Sri Lankans or  Afghans, the processing suspension introduced by the Government on 9 April 2010 will  apply.

The suspension was introduced because of evolving country information about these two  countries. The Australian Government believes that asylum seekers should only granted the  right to live in Australia if they are genuinely in need of protection.
