RUDDOCK CAUGHT COVERING UP PAYMENTS TO ASYLUM SEEKERS

Â

The Minister for Immigration, Mr Philip Ruddock, 
has been caught covering up payments to asylum seekers.Â  Documents 
leaked to the Opposition show that the Minister and his Department have 
entered a secret deal with asylum seekers caught in the so-called ‘Pacific 
Solution’ to return home.

Â

The documents show that the Department recommended 
to the Minister that, under the so-called ‘Pacific Solution’, he 
agree to pay $1000 to failed asylum seekers who had initially declined 
the Howard Government’s re-integration offer, but subsequently requested 
the assistance of the International Organisation for Migration to return 
to their homeland.Â  The leaked document shows the Minister was 
attempting to cover up the arrangement when it advised:

Â

that this arrangement not be 
publicised and [be] conducted at arm’s length from the Government.

Â

From day one of the ‘Pacific Solution’, the Howard 
Government has covered up what it is costing Australian taxpayers.Â  
Now, Minister Ruddock has been caught red-handed with a document that 
details the next cover-up.

Â

Today in Question Time I asked the Minister about 
this extraordinary memo, why he and his Department had sought to hide 
the deal from the Australian people, and whether there were any other 
deals shrouded in secrecy.Â  The Minister refused to respond in 
any real way to the question.Â  The only conclusion I can draw is 
that he has given his explicit endorsement to conducting secret deals, 
hiding the truth from the Australian people.

Â

The Federal Government is supposed to be accountable 
for what it does and its expenditure of taxpayer money.Â  Secret 
deals, hiding from publicity and making money transfers look at arms 
length from the Government are completely unacceptable whether it occurs 
in PNG and Nauru or Parramatta and Nowra.
