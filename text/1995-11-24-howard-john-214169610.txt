Leader of the Opposition

ADDRESS BY THE LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION  THE HON JOHN HOWARD MP  TO THE LEBANESE COMMUNITY  WESTELLA RECEPTION CENTRE - LIDCOMBE, SYDNEY

I am delighted to speak to you this evening. I applaud the efforts of those who have organised  such an enormous and representative gathering of the Lebanese community here in Sydney,  where almost three quarters of that at community lives.

This gathering also takes place deep in the heart of - hitherto at least - a strong Labor  electorate.

The Liberal Party greatly values the immense contribution made by those of Lebanese decent  to the building of the modem Australia.

The Liberal Party has long played a proud role in establishing in Australia an environment in  which each and every individual, regardless of background, is valued and encouraged.

We have worked to make Australia a country of opportunity and hope, a country of peace and  security, and a country where the aspirations of all have the chance of fulfilment.

The Liberal Party has been integral to providing the environment in which a unique Australian  identity has developed, an identity which draws on our country's diverse cultural heritage and  is stronger for it.

The Australian identity of today owes much to the enrichment from successive waves of  immigration to our nation, particularly since the end of World War Two.

We welcome the contributions of all Australians to our national development. We remain  committed to the idea of an inclusive society which builds on the vigour of Australia's different  cultures.

A Coalition Government will draw strength from Australia's diversity to create a more secure  future for every Australian and a future of hope for our children, an aspiration which I know  the Lebanese community shares.

I pay tribute to the significant contributions members of the Lebanese community have made  to Australian life. These contributions range across politics, business, sport and the arts. Many  well known names spring to mind, such as Nick Shehadie, Jack Nassar, Shirley Abicair, David  Malouf, Reuben Scarf, Najee Imam and other prominent business people of whom I know

several are here tonight.

In the area of sport, there is Joseph Kabalan and, of course, Bennie Elias. And my fiercely  proud Victorian colleague, Senator Jim Short has long reminded me that one of the big stars  that I saw when I was at the Australian Football League Grand Final was Carltons Mil Hanna.

The Liberal Party also have two candidates of Lebanese background for the next election -  Ibrahim Constantin on our Senate Ticket, and Morris Mansour who is our candidate for  Grayndler.

The Lebanese community has long played an important part in building our Australian nation.  Although diverse, your community has always shown a strong commitment to our country.

Your community has played a proud role in Australia for over a century. Some of your  forebears settled here as early as the 1880s, helping to open up the regional and rural areas of  Australia with the establishment of a wide variety of what we would now term small  businesses.

During the earlier part of this century many of Australia's Lebanese immigrants arrived  recognising the economic opportunities which existed in our then largely under-developed  nation and successfully pursued professional and business vocations.

In the last twenty years, however, the significant growth in Lebanese immigrants to Australia  has been due to more tragic circumstances.

The outbreak of civil war in Lebanon in 1975 and its continuation for seventeen years led to  the collapse of the Lebanese state and the destruction of its economy and infrastructure. Many  of you left Lebanon during this difficult period looking for the peace and security which was  impossible to obtain in Lebanon.

We are proud that it was Australia to which you turned.

It was a Coalition Government which oversaw the easing of Australia's entry restrictions on  humanitarian grounds for the Lebanese people from 1976 to 1980. During this period  Lebanese immigrants comprised about four percent of Australia's total immigration. Around  twenty percent of Lebanese-born people in Australia arrived at this time.

Today in Australia the Lebanese community numbers 200,000 people and spans generations.  The Lebanese community has influenced the political, economic, business, social, artistic and  cultural life of this country. We welcome this contribution and believe we can continue to  learn much from each other.

The Coalition's commitment to economic security

The Liberal Party shares many of the values on which your community places considerable  importance. The emphasis placed on the role of the family, on hard work, on economic  security and on community spirit are all values that we share.

A Coalition Government will provide the conditions for a more competitive, productive and  economically-secure Australia which rewards enterprise and dedication. We want to make  Australia a better place in which to do business and to create jobs.

The Labor Government has mismanaged the Australian economy.

It has an appalling record on unemployment which is the single greatest cause of poverty,  income inequality, social prc olems and loss of individual self-esteem.

Unemployment in Australia is at an unacceptable level and it rose even further in October to  8.7 percent.

Youth unemployment is almost four times that of the national unemployment rate - a  disgraceful 29 percent.

That is why this morning I launched the Coalition's Youth Unemployment Truck which will  publicise the truth about youth unemployment. Labor cannot be allowed to get away with  hiding its shameful record.

My concern about unemployment is something I know the Lebanese community shares.  Around 33 percent of Lebanese-born people are unemployed.

This does not represent the future of hope that many of you were looking for when you  arrived in Australia. It is disgraceful that the Labor Government has allowed unemployment in  your community to reach such levels.

The Coalition believes that much of the solution to this problem lies in reducing the burdens  on small business.

Many of your community are engaged in small businesses in the wholesale and retail trade  areas and in manufacturing.

Small business is the driving force of employment and growth in our economy. Yet the Labor  Government unfairly penalises small businesses. A change of government will make  conditions dramatically better for small business.

Only a Coalition Government can reduce the burden of excessive regulation and costs on small  business.

We will reduce the complexity of the fringe benefits tax, reduce the burden of capital gains tax  for genuine investors and those saving for their retirement, replace Labor's unfair dismissal  provisions with balanced laws and otherwise reduce the costs of doing business in Australia.

We will attack excessive costs in Australia's transport infrastructure, in particular the ports and  shipping.

A Coalition Government will create an environment which rewards enterprise and initiative.  The small business sector can be the source of new jobs and drive the future economic growth  of our country.

The Coalition recognises that around eighty percent of small businesses in Australia are family  businesses.

Opportunities available to Australia's families will determine the future of our country.

But Labor has failed to implement measures which will address the impact on families of  continuing high unemployment le els and a heavy tax burden. This produces not just  economic hardship, but social and e notional stresses as well.

Restoring the security of families will once again be a national priority under a Coalition  Government. Parents must be able to offer their children and grandchildren a better and more  secure future than was available to them.

The Coalition's commitment to a diverse society

The Coalition in government has a proud history of commitment to immigration and many  significant achievements in ethnic affairs policy.

Australia's society, economy and international relations have greatly benefited from the  contributions of our immigrant communities, including in particular the Lebanese community.

A Coalition Government will maintain our long-standing commitment to an ongoing positive  immigration program that has broad community support and that takes full account of  Australia's national interests as well as our international responsibilities.

If I can dwell for a moment on the record of achievement of the Liberal Party during our long  periods of government:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ For many years we have welcomed immigrants under a variety of programs from  Europe and the Middle East, and more recently Asia and the Pacific, all of whom  have contributed to the rich diversity of our nation.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ It was the Liberal Party in government which effectively abandoned the "White  Australia" policy in favour of a non-racial immigration policy in the 1960s.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ In government we have played a compassionate humanitarian role, responding to  international crises in a way in which every Australian should take pride.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Coalition governments have taken responsibility for resettling many people as they  fled from their homes to become refugees, and we take pride in the fact that in our  country freedom and peace can at last be found.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Other significant achievements for which Coalition governments were responsible  include the setting up the first settlement services for migrants - including English  language classes, the Special Broadcasting Service (SBS) and Migrant Resource  Centres.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The Coalition set up the Institute of Multicultural Affairs - the first government  agency to represent multicultural interests.

Humanitarian immigration, family reunion and refugee provisions will remain key components  of our immigration program, as will business migration. Our commitment to nonÂ­ discrimination on the basis of race, ethnicity, nationality, gender or religion will, of course,  continue.

A Coalition Government will also continue our successful policies for the provision of  settlement services. We will focus on the special needs of ethnic aged persons and women, as  well as the special needs of refugees.

We believe that high priority needs to be given to improved English language programs so that  everyone can participate fully in the life of the nation.

The Labor Government has not listened closely enough to the community on these issues. In  Government, the Coalition will improve the opportunities for community consultation and  input to our policy making process.

Citizenship is also an important issue. The Lebanese-born community has been particularly  impressive in taking up Australian citizenship.

I understand that 98 percent of Lebanese-born people who have been in Australia for over  fifteen years are Australian citizens, and 88 percent of those who have been here for less than  fifteen years are now Australian citizens.

I welcome and applaud your commitment to Australia and your identification with it.

Coalition policy towards Lebanon

In the last twenty years few countries have suffered as much as Lebanon. Two others spring  to mind - Cambodia and Bosnia. All three countries have experienced the most horrific and  traumatic destruction through sustained civil war.

All three are deserving of the international community's support and assistance as they try to  repair the devastation that was inflicted through conflict.

Lebanon and its people have suffered tremendously during this time. Violence along religious  and political lines has all but destroyed the physical infrastructure of Lebanon and its economy.

The tragedy is that this country once was the gateway to the Middle East. Lebanon was the  banking and commercial centre of the Arab world and Beirut was a thriving and dynamic city. I fervently hope that this will one day again be the case.

But the impact of the war has also been deeper. It is the human cost of fighting and the  deprivation of a sense of security and liberty which has had the most profound impact on the  Lebanese people.

And it is these human factors which led Australia, as I mentioned earlier, to open its doors to a  people in need.

Today, thankfully, the situation is somewhat more peaceful and there are signs of hope.

In this context, the Coalition fully supports the Middle East peace process. We are committed  to the creation of a lasting peace which sees all peoples of the region living in security and  harmony. A spirit of reconciliation, we believe, is essential for progress.

We support the United Nations resolutions on Lebanon which call for the withdrawal of all  foreign forces from Lebanon, and the need to respect the sovereignty, territorial integrity,  unity and political independence of Lebanon.

And we support the right of the Lebanese people to live in a free and democratic society, in  which the basic human rights of all its citizens are respected and protected.

As part of Coalition foreign policy, our support for democratic institution-building is an  important priority, including the aspirations of the people of Lebanon for a truly democratic  state.

Economic development and reconstruction are pressing needs for Lebanon and the assistance  of the international community in this mammoth task will be essential. The question of  resettlement of refugees and displaced persons in the region will also need to be addressed.

The Australian Government has at long last re-opened Australia's embassy in Beirut. This  occurred only as a result of pressure from a number of groups including your community and  the Coalition.

Although the embassy is open, Australia does not yet have a resident ambassador there. This  is unacceptable. The Coalition calls on the Government to immediately appoint an Australian  Ambassador to Lebanon.

The Coalition recognises the potential to further develop our relationship with the Middle East  and with Lebanon in particular. At the moment, our trading base is relatively low, but as  Lebanon re-builds it is our hope that a mutually beneficial economic and trade relationship can  be developed.

Although the Coalition will be giving priority to developing our relationship with the Asia-  Pacific region, this does not mean that we will neglect ties and opportunities in other areas of  the world. We believe that we can simultaneously develop trade, diplomatic and cultural  relations with a range of important world regions, including the Middle East.

The Labor Government has failed to adequately explore the potential of Australia-Middle East  relations. We will devote attention to strengthening and deepening the relationship.

In order to enhance Australia's relations with Lebanon we can, of course, call on the skills and  networks of our Lebanese community to provide a bridge between Australia and Lebanon, and  the Middle East more generally.

The Coalition recognises the importance of community ties between overseas-bom Australians  and their countries of birth or descent, to the future of this country.

Conclusion

The Liberal Party's vision is of an Australia where every individual has the opportunity to fulfil  his or her aspirations. We have the policies and we have the commitment to build a more  secure future for all.

The Lebanese community has played a significant role in the development of the national life  of Australia. We welcome this contribution and we will draw on it and the contributions of our  other ethnic communities to enhance our unique and successful society.

Our vision is one of a diverse Australian society based on liberal democratic values, freedom,  mutual respect, respect for differing cultures and traditions, and equality of opportunity.

It is on the basis of this commitment that the Liberal Party has played such a proud role in the  past and will continue to do so in the future.

I look forward to a Coalition Government working with your community to build a better  Australia for every one of us and for future generations of Australians.
