Thousands attend Bengali New Year festival

The Assistant Minister for Multicultural Affairs Craig Laundy MP joined thousands of people  at the Bengali New Year festival at ANZ Stadium today.

About 20,000 people attended the 24th annual Boishakhi Mela, enjoying food, arts and crafts  stalls, fireworks, children’s rides, and traditional Bengali music and dance performances.

Mr Laundy said the festival is a reminder that Australia is a migrant nation in which one in  four of us was born overseas.

“Migrants and refugees, including our many Bengali Australians, have enriched our culture  and added to our national story,” Mr Laundy said.

According to the latest Census (2011), there are more than 35,000 Bengali speakers in  Australia, most of whom are born in Bangladesh, with many others born in Australia and  India.

“Bengali is just one of the 300 ancestries we share in Australia where we speak almost as  many languages, including Indigenous languages,” he said.

Festival organisers the Bangabandhu Council of Australia, which represents the interests of  many Bengali Australians, has been organising Bengali New Year celebrations since 1993.

Mr Laundy said Australia’s rich cultural diversity is a source of great social and economic  strength.

“The Australian Government is proud of our diversity and the enrichment to our culture that  comes from events like this.

“We are working closely with culturally and linguistically diverse communities to strengthen  civil society and continue to ensure we have strong and cohesive communities.”
