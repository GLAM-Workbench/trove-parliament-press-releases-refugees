TURNBULL CUTS OFF VULNERABLE ASYLUM SEEKERS TRYING TO GET  AHEAD

The Turnbull Government is continuing its attack on some of the most vulnerable people  in Australia by cutting off support for asylum seekers currently studying.

Reports today detail that the Department of Home Affairs has removed study as an  approved option for income support and rent assistance for asylum seekers on bridging  visas.

The move even applies to asylum seekers in Australia studying English, putting the  Department of Home Affairs at odds with the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural  Affairs, who said just two days ago-

"All the evidence shows that if you have better English, the chances of you getting work  are so much higher and the chances of you getting a better job are so much better as  well. It absolutely is in their interests, and we do not want people to be languishing on  welfare, whether or not you are a new migrant or anybody else."

Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, Alan Tudge  2GB, 7 March 2018

These are some of the most vulnerable people in Australia who are trying to get ahead  so they can make a living and contribute to society. Instead, the Turnbull Government is  cutting off their financial support and housing, somehow thinking it will help them.

Of course, if there are abuses in the system, the system should be tightened.

The Turnbull Government should stop playing politics with vulnerable people.  Purposefully making these people destitute and homeless can only exacerbate the  difficulties they may face in trying to make a living.
