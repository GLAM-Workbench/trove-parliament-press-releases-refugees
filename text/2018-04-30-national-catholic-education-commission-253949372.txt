CATHOLIC	SECTOR	WELCOMES	GONSKI	2.0	RECOMMENDATIONS

The	National	Catholic	Education	Commission	welcomes	the	report	of	the	Review	to	Achieve	Educational	Excellence	in	Australian

Schools,	Through	Growth	to	Achievement,	released	by	the	Australian	Government	today.

The	NCEC’s	acting	executive	director	Ray	Collins	says,	while	there	is	a	need	to	look	at	the	report	in	further	detail,	the	wide-ranging

report	appears	consistent	with	the	submissions	lodged	by	Catholic	education	entities,	takes	into	account	current	educational

research	and	thinking,	and	responds	to	the	key	challenges	being	faced	by	Australian	schools	and	systems.

Mr	Collins	said	on	first	impressions,	the	recommendations	reflect	many	of	the	strategies	identified	in	Catholic	sector	submissions,

including:

Ã¢ÂÂ the	need	for	a	national	evidence	base	and	broader	performance	and	assessment	measures	for	teachers	to	use	beyond

standardised	testing

Ã¢ÂÂ ensuring	a	national	approach	to	learning	and	performance	measures	across	early	childhood	to	post-school	pathways

Ã¢ÂÂ ensuring	teachers	are	well-supported	with	professional	learning

Ã¢ÂÂ ensuring	greater	autonomy	for	teachers	and	principals

Ã¢ÂÂ identifying	strategies	to	lift	the	status	of	the	teaching	profession,	and

Ã¢ÂÂ a	renewed	commitment	to	prioritising	capabilities	within	the	Australian	Curriculum.



“In	particular,	we	welcome	the	recommendations	to	ensure	a	strong	foundation	for	the	early	years	of	schooling	and	a	stronger	focus

on	capabilities	such	as	critical	thinking,	creativity	and	complex	problem	solving.”



“This	will	require	broad-based	assessment	and	performance	measures	that	teachers	can	use	to	inform	their	teaching	and	learning

programs,”	Mr	Collins	said.



“Catholic	education	strongly	supports	the	report’s	recommendations	that	reduce	the	administrative	and	reporting	burden	on

teachers	and	principals	to	ensure	more	time	for	their	own	professional	learning	and	instructional	leadership.

“The	focus	on	personalised	learning	to	achieve	one	year’s	learning	gain	for	each	student	regardless	of	their	starting	point	is	a

commendable	goal,	which	will	make	it	absolutely	necessary	to	reduce	unnecessary	bureaucracy	and	distractions	to	learning	and

teaching,	and	will	have	critical	implications	for	the	resourcing	and	funding	of	schools	and	systems,”	he	said.

The	NCEC	believes	greater	consultation	and	a	national	discussion	is	needed	for	the	recommendations	to	develop	a	national	approach

to	Years	11	and	12	and	the	ambitious	introduction	of	a	new	national	education	agreement	in	2019.

Mr	Collins	said	the	implementation	of	the	review’s	recommendations	will	be	challenging	as	they	require	the	cooperation	of	state	and

territory	governments	and	all	school	sectors,	and	will	involve	significant	reform	within	school	communities.

“This	is	a	substantial	report	but	one	that	will	be	challenging	to	implement,	largely	because	of	its	reliance	on	the	cooperation	of	all

sectors	and	governments.	Many	of	the	recommendations	rely	on	reform	at	the	school	or	classroom	level,	which	requires	appropriate

support,	resources	and	local	leadership.

“Central	to	the	successful	implementation	of	the	recommendations	is	the	recognition	of	the	needs	of	school	systems	-	such	as	the

Catholic	system,	the	nation's	largest	provider	of	schooling	outside	government	-	to	have	the	necessary	autonomy	to	address	need.

“It’s	a	big	challenge	that	will	require	a	significant	commitment	from	all	governments	and	we	hope	that	the	upcoming	federal	budget

will	reflect	the	costs	involved	in	implementing	these	proposed	reforms,	as	well	the	recommendations	from	the	recent	report	into

Regional,	Rural	and	Remote	Education.”































































REVIEW TO  ACHIEVE  EDUCATIONAL  EXCELLENCE  IN AUSTRALIAN  SCHOOLS



November 2017



1



Executive Summary  Catholic schools have been part of Australia’s education story for 200 years. Catholic schools today  educate one in five Australian children. Catholic systems see themselves as partners with families,

with government, with the broader community and with other schools in delivering a high-quality  educational choice in almost every part of the country. Indeed, almost 40 per cent of Catholic  schools are outside major metropolitan areas. Catholic education is also playing an increasing role in  early childhood services, which are a vital part of our education system.

The National Catholic Education Commission (NCEC) submission sets out the unique characteristics  of Catholic education and its vision for educational success for Australian students. The submission  argues that while measuring success is important, there are a number of student outcomes that are  difficult to measure but which should be considered as indicators of educational excellence. Where  data are used successfully, they should analyse student progress over time, explore opportunities for  data linkage and consider the personal and familial contexts of each student.

The NCEC submission shows that schools systems are an important and valuable part of the  governance arrangements of Catholic and other school systems, and crucial to their ability to  operate efficiently and effectively. School systems operate in a diversity of contexts across Australia  and intimately understand the needs of their students. The NCEC would not support government  funding being tethered to a scheme that micromanages school systems and creates onerous  regulatory and reporting imposts.

Our submission also explores some barriers to achieving educational success, including the SES  methodology, privacy legislation and the complex challenges of educating students in regional, rural  and remote Australia.

The NCEC thanks the Review Panel for the opportunity to make a submission to the Review and  would welcome any further discussions on the matters we have canvassed.

What should educational success for Australian students and schools look like?  The National Catholic Education Commission (NCEC), representing 1,737 Catholic schools and more  than 765,000 students across Australia, believes the Australian schooling system should be high-quality and high-equity, developing young Australians as passionate learners and creative  individuals, and fostering active and informed citizens who are the cornerstone of a successful  workforce, strong economy and improved productivity. The NCEC also heeds the words of Pope  Francis who believes that education is an act of hope because it builds upon the future in a spirit of  service. Catholic education cultivates the whole person—cognitive, affective, physical, social, ethical  and spiritual—encouraging every student to develop their talents in an environment of solidarity.  These themes are echoed in the Melbourne Declaration on Educational Goals for Young Australians.

In valuing the uniqueness of each individual and believing in the education of the whole person, the  NCEC considers successful Australian schools must, and do, focus on meeting the diverse needs of  students. The NCEC submissions to the Productivity Commission’s 2016 Inquiry into the National  Education Evidence Base argued that by further developing the national evidence base for schooling,  government policy can support all children to achieve to their potential, regardless of their postcode  or life circumstances. These submissions are available at the following locations:  https://www.pc.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0008/199682/sub049-education-evidence.pdf   https://www.pc.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0003/208839/subdr106-education-evidence.pdf.

Measuring success  National and international assessments of student achievement are recognised and supported as a  useful reference, but these provide only a partial snapshot of achievement at a point in time and not  a complete picture of students’ performance, development and progress. The measurement of  school success should not be limited to cognitive outcomes as assessed by standardised tests. Such  tests are a helpful tool but are not sufficient in and of themselves. Catholic schools strive to educate  the whole person and seek to acknowledge and highlight those important outcomes of education  that are not so easily measured. These outcomes include critical and creative thinking, emotional  intelligence and the ability to negotiate complex problems. Indeed, Catholic schools often support  and educate students coming from challenging backgrounds, helping those students complete their  education, become strong contributors to their family and community and empowering them to  overcome intergenerational violence and poverty. While this outcome would not be captured by  standardised tests, it is clearly a case of a school delivering educational excellence. The NCEC would  welcome the opportunity to engage in a national conversation about how measures of broader  elements such as wellbeing, resilience and social development might be developed and used to the  advantage of students and wider society.

The NCEC has previously raised the advantage of a national education evidence base that is   wide-ranging, longitudinal and ambitious, with well-considered opportunities to link data from  within the education domain and beyond it to areas such as health, early childhood and community  and social services. The evidence should be framed by clear strategic objectives and an overarching  purpose.  A broad education evidence base, characterised by considered, valid and reliable measures  to track development and significant changes over time, should not sit in isolation from evidence  available on health and social welfare. It should be possible for education data to be linked to health  data and welfare data in a meaningful way. Linked data could provide insights into educational  disadvantage and make correlations between school outcomes and life outcomes. These  correlations could then be extended to improving educational outcomes.

Using data to achieve educational excellence  One of the challenges of educational policy is that of how and where to use a potential plethora of  data to greatest advantage. While NAPLAN data is used on the My School website for the purposes  of broadly like school comparisons, more successful use of the data lies in the capacity to analyse  individual student progress over time, to better understand the positive differences teachers make  every day and to look to high-gain schools, where the same cohort has shown significant  improvement over time to understand why these schools perform well and thereby inform better  teaching.  These latter functions are generally best performed at the school and jurisdictional level  where appropriate interventions can be targeted. For Catholic education, the role of the family is  paramount and the capacity to work with family circumstances and contexts towards improving  their children’s outcomes is fundamental to school planning.

What can we do to improve and how can we support ongoing improvements over time?  On the question of how school funding could be used more effectively and efficiently to improve all  students’ outcomes, the NCEC submission reiterates the importance and benefits of school systems,  which the Gonski Review of Funding for Schooling: Final Report argued “provide assurance to the  Australian Government that Australia has an effective and efficient schooling effort” (46). Systems  add value to the Australian education system through a commitment to building new schools and  supporting existing ones; creating efficiencies and enabling economies of scale; supporting financial  viability of member schools; and helping schools meet the compliance and accountability demands.

For Catholic education, system funding is central to its capacity to operate effectively and efficiently.  It does this in the following ways:



3



Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Distribution of government funding across systemically funded Catholic schools according to  need can occur using detailed local-level and school-specific information, and more up-to- date  information, than is available to the Australian Government and State/Territory governments.  Catholic systems are best placed to assess the financial condition and resource requirements of  their individual schools, improving outcomes in terms of financial viability and educational  equity.  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Catholic systems are able to use needs-based distribution to address need in relation to

particular school characteristics (e.g. size, location, remoteness and the socio-economic status of  the community). In relation to new schools, which suffer from a lack of economies of scale as  they progressively grow to their full enrolment, block funding of the system and redistribution of  funds enables the operation of the school to be appropriately supported as it develops.  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Catholic systems are able to cross-subsidise to address perceived shortfalls in government

funding arrangements for certain students with high needs (e.g. students with disability,  Indigenous students, ESL students including new arrivals and refugee students). There is also a  greater capacity for systems—through economies of scale—to address growing infrastructure  needs, which government funding cannot always alleviate.  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Catholic systems also use needs-based distribution to assist students whose particular

educational needs are not directly funded through the loadings of the model, e.g. students with  challenging behavioural needs and specific learning difficulties, as well as students from newly-arrived refugee families.

The NCEC submission supports the national desire to improve student outcomes yet emphasises the  rich diversity of contexts across Australia. Catholic systems intimately understand the needs of their  schools and students and contend these benefits must be maintained. The NCEC would not support  government funding tethered to a scheme that micromanages and leads to onerous regulations and  excessive reporting. A sensible level of accountability is, of course, welcome. The governance  arrangements of Catholic systems will ensure ongoing implementation of evidence-based actions.

Catholic systems support ongoing improvement over time through existing strategies and would  welcome future strategies that include:  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ a focus on developing the capacity and expertise of early career teachers and quality pre-  service programs for teachers;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ a commitment to developing and improving data literacy within the teaching profession;  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ a focus on enhancing the professional standing of teachers in the community and attracting the  best people into the profession;  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ cross-sectoral resource sharing and a renewed commitment to further developing national

resource banks such as Scootle;  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ the implementation of a nationally consistent student identifier. A unique student identifier  presents an opportunity for longitudinal data that could provide insights across the life cycle of  learning, from early childhood to post-school pathways;  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ a renewed commitment to prioritising general capabilities within the Australian Curriculum;  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ active sharing of evidence-based effective practice that improves student outcomes. Evidence

for Learning (http://evidenceforlearning.org.au/), which is based on and affiliated with the  Education Endowment Fund in the UK, is one example;  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ parent engagement in learning and wellbeing, including in early childhood education, which is  vital for enhancing children’s development;  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ a focus on assessment practices for learning, as well as higher-level process skills necessary to

participate in a changing and dynamic environment;  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ ongoing awareness and training in relation to disabilities and their functional impact and  appropriate adjustments;  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ support for teachers to differentiate teaching in order to extend high-achieving students;



4



Ã¢ÂÂ¢ allowing systems, schools and teachers to exercise autonomy, creativity and professional  judgement in a spirit of subsidiarity and in accordance with the curriculum, while remaining  accountable and consistent;  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ continuous learning through innovation and effective use of research and data.

Indeed, improving the national capacity for data linkage—that is, the capacity of one set of data, for  example the ABS Census, to illuminate another dataset—is particularly important for the early years  of schooling when there is an opportunity to link educational and health data. This could be  achieved alongside the consolidation and expansion of the national capacity for longitudinal study  and longitudinal data linkage and analysis. Over time, the technology of data collection and  management will change, the privacy provisions around data will require careful attention,  expectations of governments, communities and schools will increase but all the agencies involved in  determining evidence on school outcomes will still need to focus on ensuring that any data meets  fundamental standards of quality, integrity, meaningfulness, feasibility of collection and  management.

Are there barriers to implementing these improvements?  A significant barrier to educational success in the non-government school sector is the continuation  of the Socio-Economic Status (SES) funding model in its current form. Catholic system schools are  local neighbourhood schools operating at about 84% of the total government funding that  government schools receive. Their physical resources are modest and their student/teacher ratios  are substantially higher than the high-fee schools with which they share an SES score. The Australian  Education Act 2013 will continue to use the existing SES methodology in the Commonwealth’s school  funding model in 2018, despite the fact that the Gonski Review of Funding for Schooling and 2013  National Education Reform Agreement recommended that a more precise measure of capacity to  contribute should replace the existing SES methodology. However, the NCEC acknowledges the  Commonwealth Government has indicated that the National School Resourcing Board will review  the SES methodology.

Privacy legislation  The complexity and diversity of privacy legislation across Australian jurisdictions and sectors is a  barrier to the development of national evidence-based research. As government schools must  comply with State or Territory legislation and the non-government sector with the Commonwealth  Privacy Principles, the ability to conduct robust and rigorous national data linkage studies is limited.  The barriers of privacy legislation result in studies using only deidentified data and creates issues for  introducing a national unique student identifier. It is time the education sector explored lessons  learnt from the health sector regarding accessing and analysing national datasets. This is vital if the  sector is to provide educators, government and the wider community with confidence in producing  rigorous national research that reflects the Australian educational context.

Other barriers  There are other barriers to implementing improvements that achieve educational excellence in  Australian schools, including:  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ the lack of long-term Commonwealth Government support for systems and jurisdictions to

improve teacher quality;  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ compliance costs and regulatory burden, which are significant issues for Catholic schools.  Beyond the existing reporting obligations and regulatory requirements created by the Australian  Education Act and other project reports for government funding schemes, non-government

schools are subjected to the reporting requirements arising from the unnecessary regulatory  burden that the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission imposes. Catholic schools  devote considerable time and resources to meeting these reporting requirements and complying



5



with regulations. Reducing the regulatory burden on Catholic schools means more time and  resources can be devoted to enhancing schools and improving student outcomes;  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ the complex challenges for education in regional, rural and remote Australia. The educational  outcomes of children in these areas is shaped by a range of in-school and out-of-school factors

and their interface. The mission of Catholic education has inspired Catholic schools that serve  students in regional, rural and remote areas across Australia, especially students that may be  disadvantaged or marginalised. Indeed, in some remote areas of Australia, the Catholic school is  the only school that serves families and students that wish to remain in their home community.  However, as the NCEC submission to the Independent Review into Regional, Rural and Remote  Education has shown, attracting and retaining high-quality principals and teaching staff,  shortages of allied health professionals and digital technology deficiencies are some of the  challenges in regional, rural and remote Australia.
