SINCLAIR COMMENTS ON AGE CABLE

The Deputy Leader of the Australian Country Party Mr. Ian

Sinclair said that the publication of diplomatic messages

relating to North Vietnam and South Vietnam reveal the

hypocrisy of the Australian Government.

"With Andrew Peacock I have asserted the existence of these

cables for some weeks," Mr. Sinclair said.

"Their publication today confirms their existence.

"They reveal the myth of the Government assertion that they

are being even-handed to both sides in the Vietnamese war.

reveal

They also / that the Government, led by the Prime Minister,  has deceived Parliament and the people of Australia denying

the contents of the cables and claiming that the message in

both cables was the same.

"The contents of the cables quite obviously show the

Governmentâ€™s hypocrisy.

"They reveal that the Government has backed the North Vietnamese

cause during the current fighting in the most blatant manner

and with callous disregard to the people of South Vietnam.

"The Government by its action is openly advocating military

success for the North Vietnamese and the provisional

revolutionary Government.

"Their advocacy of their success reveals that the Australian

Government has done so little to give humanitarian aid to the

refugees of South Vietnam.

"The duplicity of the Prime Minister Mr. Whitlam stands exposed

for all to see.

"His approach, which has been backed up by his senior Ministers,

towards Australian foreign relations on this matter is nauseating

and damns the Government foreign affairs policy."
