Challenging the Rise of Contemporary Authoritarianism Eric Sidoti

"The Parliament House reflects the Australian national spirit. It is a very deeply ingrained notion in Australia that the purpose of the government is to serve the people, and that the individual is more powerful than the government. This is reflected in the building by the wide lawn that arches

over the building. This public space is open at all times, and is not guarded. Visitors to the Parliament House are invited to climb literally on top of their government, thus symbolizing their power over it. "flJ Asa Hopkins,1998

I have had a lot to do with Canberra over many years now. I have had to spend a lot of time in Parliament House — going right back to 1981 in the old Parliament House. Life in that old Parliament House, as some of you might recall, was very cheek-by-jowl. You were very tightly packed in there. I used to love to go down there. One of the things that I really loved about that place was that all of the politicians from the Prime Minister down would come in through the front door. They would come in through the front door and walk

across the public galleries of King's Hall. I remember the days we would be there and Hawkie would walk in or this Minister or that Senator would stride in and they would be nodding and talking to people on the way through. They would always pass through the public before they went to the back rooms where all the work was done. So I was one of those who was in two minds about the new Parliament.

The move in 1988 was absolutely essential — the old Parliament House was unworkable — but you got this big, flash, new building and I thought, `What is this going to mean for us?' Not just those of us who used to wander around the corridors and look for those unexpected meetings but for all of us.

I remember the architects [principally Romaldo Giurgola of Mitchell, Giurogola and Thorp] of the new Parliament House discussing the philosophy behind it. The thinking really impressed me. For those of you who have been there, it is actually built into the hill so that the hill in effect sits atop the entire building -

chambers, offices, galleries, the lot. The philosophy, as the architects explained, was simple: that in a democracy like ours the people should always be above their representatives. And the whole symbolism of the people being there, physically present, being able to walk over the top of the chambers and being able to actually own the parliament has always been alive for me.

And not just for me it seems. A few years ago I caught a cab out from the airport at Canberra and the cabbie was chatting away when we pulled into view of Parliament House. He said, `You know, a little while ago I had the new Canadian High Commissioner [I think it was the Canadian High Commissioner but in any case a senior foreign diplomat] in the cab. We were driving down here and we were approaching Parliament House

and he said: "Isn't that just the most amazing sight! Isn't that a beautiful thing!" And I said to him, "It's a great building and it took a while ..." "I don't mean the building" he said, "but look at all those kids rolling down the hill.!" And there were all these school kids up on the top of the hill just rolling down. He said, "Where else in the world would you fmd kids rolling down the hills of their Parliament?"

I was down in Canberra for meetings on Tuesday and as you come down Commonwealth Avenue today on the approach to the Parliament you are struck not by the schools kids — they're no longer to be seen- but by

http://www.hrca.org.au/CCJP.htm 15/12/2003

these huge barricades that ring the Hill. The people no longer have free, unencumbered access to the top of the Parliament House. They have been barred. These barricades direct you where you go, how you get in, where you enter, where you leave. To say this made me feel very sad doesn't capture what I felt. It really upset me

because I thought here is the symbolic equivalent of what we see eating away at the guts of our democracy -that's how it felt to me.

I would contend that our democracy is under threat and it is the nature of that threat that I would like to explore with you today.

About two years ago my colleagues and I at the Human Rights Council of Australia put some time aside to consider just what was happening in Australia. Individually we had been growing increasingly concerned. Collectively, we put together the beginnings of our analysis. We were conscious of various matters of public concern: the collapse of reconciliation efforts; the open assault on the rights of asylum seekers; a series of attacks on individual judges and the credibility of the judiciary more generally. Those of us who have a lot to do with advocacy work felt conscious of

changes in the way we were being forced to relate to Government and how the public service was operating. Each of these matters had been in the spotlight at one time or other. Even then we recognised that the public attention was often fleeting. More significantly, what occurred to us was the fact no one was actually putting the picture together. It struck us that perhaps the cumulative effect of all these different little changes in the way that our system operates and the culture that guides that system were changing in a way that undermined the very fabric of our democracy. We came to characterise this apparent trend as creeping authoritarianism.

I will attempt to canvass these developments under six broad headings:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Key Democratic Institutions

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Government Authorities and Agencies

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Government's Relationship with the Non-Government Sector

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The State and the Individual

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The demise of International Citizenship

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Characteristics of the New Authoritarianism

I promise though that I won't conclude before suggesting a few things that we might think about doing.

KEY DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS

While our federal system of government is complex, we would all pretty well agree on certain institutions which underpin the democracy of that system. These would include:

Parliament Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The Public Service Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The Judiciary Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Academia Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Our Public Broadcaster

The few brief comments and examples that follow are essentially illustrative of the corrosion of our democratic structures concerning us.

The Role of the Executive

The observation has been made that John Howard is the most presidential of Australian Prime Ministers. Certainly the current Government is the most executive Australian government in my living memory.

You will all have experiences of this. One recent one for me occurred in the lead up to the Iraq war. I met with my own Local Member about our respective positions on the war. He is a decent man and I thought it important, given his role as a Government backbencher, to urge him to raise concerns that were demonstrably widespread in our own community. There emerged a number of common questions and concerns during the course of our two-hour conversation but I was left in no doubt that he would not be seriously raising these let alone challenging the Prime Minister's clear intention of

following the US to war. What he told me in effect was that the Prime Minister is convinced and we are just going to have to trust him. End of story. Evidently, as far as he was concerned the Prime Minister's word is effectively gospel. It is incontrovertible in practical terms. It is not that my local Member is alone in this.

The Prime Minister's impressive political acumen has been evident in his capacity to tightly control the machinery of politics including his own Party. We had inklings of it when the Howard Government first came into power; it was some months before senior advisors were appointed to most of the ministries. One reason for this was that every advisor was vetted by the Prime Minister's

office directly — in many cases it would seem recruiting advisers themselves. Even now, if you survey the list of current advisors, you would find that a number of them have either served time in the Prime Minister's own office or would in other ways have direct links to the PM's circle. Mr Howard has shown a remarkable interest in the "small picture" when it comes to the detail of the political machine.

While none of these things are wrong per se, they are hardly indicative of a healthy and robust democracy. They are, however, indicative of a style of Government that values control and brooks no opposition.

This Prime Minister's imprint is similarly evident in the changes in the way his own Department operates. The transformation of the Prime Minister's department into being an extension of the Prime Minister's office was introduced under Max Moore-Wilton's term as Secretary. The significance and impact of these changes are clearly evident in David Marr's and Marian Wilkinson's dissection of the Government's campaign against asylum seekers in their book Dark

Victory. IQ

The dangers of any Prime Minister's unchallenged supremacy are compounded when buttressed by an increasingly shackled Parliament. Again some attention had been given to the damaging implications of a weak and ineffectual Parliamentary Opposition. However, there have also been significant changes in the way Parliament itself operates which in turn dampen the capacity for opposition.

Parliamentary Scrutiny

http://www.hrca.org.au/CCJP.htm 15/12/2003

Australian Democracy

Page 6 of 32

Parliamentary procedures have changed in a number of ways. Illustrative of this is the way in which Parliamentary committees operate and their diminished impact. Political commentator, Laura Tingle, has made the point that Senate estimates committees are now "one of the few places where the Parliament can actually demand, and receive, information from executive government" in contrast to the diminished role of House of Representative committees.[) She discerns a trend whereby the

inquiries undertaken by these committees increasingly provide platforms to "beat up" State Labor Governments rather than throwing a light back on what the Commonwealth Government is doing and how it is operating. Even when the committees do tackle relevant issues, the Executive simply fails to take any serious notice of their advice. This is true of the Senate committees that do still have a degree of freedom but remain largely ignored. I suspect we would also find that the government is slower in formally responding to a number of reports or simply not responding at all though I haven't yet had a chance to confirm my suspicion.

We are not getting that same degree of focus on what the government is or is not doing, or how it is doing it, with respect to the key issues of the day. The combined difficulties in firstly accessing information and then in scrutinising it dilute Parliamentary accountability.

A Genuinely Public Service

One of the more damaged of our key institutions is the public service itself. Any of you who read Dark VictoiyL4J would have had a very clear exposition of the way the Public Service has, in terms of its culture and operation, changed dramatically. While generally discussed in terms of its

"politicisation", what we have is a public service that is — for whatever reason - far from being frank and fearless. It is predominantly concerned with what the reaction of the relevant minister or government leadership may be to the advice that they receive.

The consequence is "advice" designed to reflect as far as possible the Government's pre-disposition: what that may be is often assumed so that information is filtered and, at times, withheld lest it prove distasteful or problematic. On other occasions, when the Government's will is clear, the advice, is made to order. I don't mean by this that explicit directions are given, but rather that a good public

servant, like a good tailor, comes to know what the customer wants. Indeed, I have more than once in recent years heard public servants describe their Minister in exactly those terms as their primary customer.

Now, we can't be sure — although I think Marr and Wilkinson make a very strong case — whether this is an intentional consequence of the way the executive and ministers are operating. But the effect is the same. It becomes a very strong political defence to say `I never received the information.' We need look no further than this week's Hansard to find an example, on this occasion in the education portfolio, with Brendan Nelson's defence over the alleged excision of material to a higher education report he received from his Department.j5J

The very notion of Ministerial responsibility and accountability has altered. The relationship between a Minister and her/his department has altered. There was a time when the minister was responsible for the operation of their department and would fall on their sword even if they were not directly responsible for any sufficiently serious indiscretion. No longer it seems.

If you stand back a bit a picture does begin to emerge from the dots. These are not isolated incidents: the Wilkinson/Marr exposition of what happened in the Department of Immigration and what

http://www.hrca.org.au/CCJP.htm 15/12/2003

Australian Democracy

Page 7 of 32

happened in the Department of the Prime Minister with respect to the Tampa and "baby-over-board" affair is just one example. We see it in Education; we saw it with respect to Defence under Peter Reith. We see a shadow of it whenever we hear a Minister utter the words "I wasn't informed" in his own defence. There are other similarly coded phrases: a popular one is "acting on the information available to me at the time". We certainly heard this one often enough in the lead up to (and now in the wash up from) the Iraq War as Andrew Wilkie would clearly indicate through his evidence concerning intelligence and how it was provided and used. My point is that while we do see individual matters occasionally pop up in the press, taken together examples like this point at the very least towards a significant cultural shift in the notion of public service and what it means to be a diligent public servant.

The Judiciary

We have also seen changes in the way the Government treats and relates to the judiciary. The Attorney General, for a long time, we had assumed was there as guardian of the judiciary at least to the extent of its independence and standing. The current Attorney General [Daryl Williams] has failed to preserve public confidence in the judiciary most particularly of course the High Court. He

has himself mounted a high degree of political pressure: questioning judicial decisions and raising doubts in the public mind. But it is not so much that the Attorney General mounts those attacks, as that he has failed to protect the independence and integrity of the Australian judiciary and the

judicial system; even to the extent of allowing personal assaults on the Court and individual judges to go unanswered.

Many would recall the Attorney General standing idly by as Senator Heffernan launched his scurrilous and unfounded allegations against Justice Michael Kirby. However, the more damning example is the apparent complicity as the Government has undermined the judiciary in defence of its

own political agenda. Mr Ruddock's attacks on the Federal Court have attracted particular attention: as far back as June 2002, Benjamin Haslem was reporting in the Australian that a "serious rift has emerged between senior Federal Court judges and the Howard Government over repeated attacks on the Court by Immigration Minister Philip Ruddock".[J Justice Graham Hill in fact was reported as having warned that Australians' human rights and freedoms —taken for granted for more than a

century- were at grave risk from a government contemptuous of judges.

When Government leaders like Philip Ruddock go to the jugular of judicial decisions it undermines our confidence in that system but also quite clearly it undermines the confidence of judges themselves in their position in society and more particularly in the reaction any decisions

unfavourable to the Government might provoke. What we are witnessing is the erosion of the judiciary's confidence in the community; an erosion of our confidence as citizens in the judiciary's independence and ability to actually make decisions free of influence; and a state of constant uncertainty as the Executive threatens legislative changes as a mark of its displeasure.

Academia

We discern these characteristics of authoritarian behaviour in the key and traditionally independent world of academia.

The Higher Education debate has focused very largely on the resourcing of higher education and to some degree, fortunately, on the question of equitable access to education. What we haven't actually

http://www.hrca.org.au/CCJP.htm 15/12/2003

Australian Democracy

Page 8 of 32

seen in any coherent way — apart from the occasional uproar over individual cases — is the growing threat to academic freedom itself. The war on academic freedom is being waged on two fronts: the constraints on academics themselves and the pressures on the institutions within which they operate.

Academic freedom depends upon our intellectuals being able to conduct research, to think and to write with the confidence that they are independent, that they can say what needs to be said, that they can explore issues without fear or favour. Yet the walls are closing in: they are much more beholden

to commercial interests and to the fact that universities are driven by the need to raise external funds. What they research, offer and teach is driven by popular demand in a policy environment that ultimately values education as a commodity. Even then the "market" is further shaped by Government intervention through funding tied to central Government priorities. As one PhD student noted, the problem with the Government's list of research priorities became manifest when he read

that "...all Government research agencies will report to [Minister] Peter McGauran within six months, advising on how they intend to focus their research on delivering our national research priorities".jam The issue is not whether the priorities are good or bad: on this occasion, for example, the four priorities included research on environmental sustainability, good health, `frontier technologies' and protecting the country "against terrorism, crime, invasive diseases, pests and threats to critical infrastructure".j Mind you, the last of these sounds like the stuff of nightmares!

The issue is the extent to which research is politically driven and engineered through the associated funding arrangements.

Though I won't elaborate on it here, a different but related issue is the compilation, use of and access to data compiled by Government agencies under the direction of Governments. The unemployment statistics are a case in point but certainly not the only example. While we should be concerned about the way data disguises, in this case, what may or may not be the true employment figures, the underlying concern is the consequent limitations on our capacity to actually know what is happening

in our society and therefore our capacity to make informed political decisions ourselves - let alone act upon them.

Added to the matters raised already are several others which I will only lightly touch upon.

The first is the particular impact of industrial reforms being imposed upon our universities: some commentators focus on the disappearance of security of tenure; others highlight the Government's attempts to force university-based researchers onto individual contracts, to make it a breach of the `national interest' to strike, and again to tie research funds to a university's IR status..[]

The attempt to strangle dissenting voices (and collective action) is not limited to academics. Students too are in the sights; students of all ages. The Commonwealth Education Minister, Dr Nelson, apparently feels so strongly on such matters that he fired out a media release arguing that "school children should be at schools, not at protests".J 10J Many school students did attend the protests he

was referring to opposing Australia's undeclared war on Iraq. In my neck of the woods at least most did so with their parents consent if not encouragement. The Minister went on to deliver an implied threat that such activity was in breach of the law. He did so in spite of the fact that schools and the relevant legislation are State Government responsibilities and as such outside his jurisdiction.

And there is still more to tell. I haven't even begun to discuss the apparently concerted attempt by this Government (and others) to ensure that research and educational content is constructed according to in its own worldview. It is most evident in the re-telling of our national story: the attacks on the so-called `black armband' version of history, the clean out at the National Museum,

http://www.hrca.org.au/CCJP.htm 15/12/2003

Australian Democracy

Page 9 of 32

the creation of new military myths and iconography. This is not to say that there is only one perspective or understanding of the past; but whatever story is told must at the least be based on the available evidence, rigorous and credible.

Public Broadcasting

The last of our key democratic institutions I would like to consider before moving on is our public broadcaster. Political parties of all persuasions have always had their differences with the ABC. However, the assault by the Howard Government has been relentless. The way in which this is being done bears striking similarities with the approach taken towards the judiciary and other institutions.

It is persistent, spearheaded by senior ministers leaving the Prime Minister in charge but unsullied. The apparent aim of de-legitimating the people and the institution is pursued through frequent, intimidating and sometimes personal attacks. Government funding provides the leverage. The

combined effect is to limit the capacity of the ABC to do its job and to undermine public confidence in ,their capacity to provide us with objective, in-depth analysis of social and political issues but also of broader economic issues.

We see it in a number of ways: the allegations of bias, and -in the case of the coverage of the Iraq war- distracting, disruptive formal complaints accompanied by public wrangling over the suitability of the complaints mechanisms. Attacks of this type have wider repercussions: self-censorship; timorous interviews; the selection of issues to be investigated; programming; over-zealous management in controlling journalists and program staff. The ABC management and staff are

generally proving courageous and resilient but such constant pressures cannot but effect their work not just their working environment.

Whatever the ultimate findings of Senator Alston's complaints, the net impact is to actually sow further seeds of doubt about what the ABC is or is not doing in the minds of the public. And therein lies a greater danger for the next four or five years than whether the ABC can show Behind the News (though my outraged children and their classmates might argue differently). It is a bigger issue

about the public institution itself.

Adele Horin makes the telling observation that the Government, in the form of the Communications Minister Richard Alston, is seeking to wrongfully appropriate the ABC as an arm of Government. Commenting on the Minister's claiming that the ABC is "accountable to the Government in the same way as any other organisation", she reminds us all that "the ABC is a public broadcaster, not a state

broadcaster". lLI ].

GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES AND AGENCIES

Over the years the machinery of government has expanded through the establishment of a number of statutory authorities, commissions, tribunals and specialist agencies. These organisations cover an array of functions — a cursory listing would include the ACCC, the Industrial Relations Commission, the Australian Tax Office. Not surprisingly this Government, like others before it, has left its mark on authorities such as these, adapting their mandates and structures to meet the Government's policy objectives. At one level this is quite reasonable and proper.

Yet, there is a line where Government interference and the manner of exerting its influence become

http://www.hrea.org.au/CCJP.htm 15/12/2003

Australian Democracy

Page 10 of 32

questionable if not unacceptable behaviour. Questions should arise where an agency shields a Government, reduces rather than provides transparency, or Government action hampers, if not destroys, an agency's ability to fulfil its intended role in promoting and protecting the public interest. At times stories circulate suggesting the use of an agency as the government's stalking horse pursuing individuals or organisations that have aroused the Government's ire. Such stories are notoriously difficult to verify particularly as it is often the question of motivation which is at issue. More often reports emerge alleging undue Government influence as was the case earlier this year when the Head of the Australian Accounting Standards Board raised concerns, supported by the Australian National Audit Office, regarding the erosion of existing standards for the Government's own financial reporting.

While we would argue there is reason enough for concern —possibly enough to warrant further investigation across a broad range of statutory authorities and tribunals- what we can say with some confidence is that those agencies that have a particular role in promoting and protecting human rights are well and truly in the Government's sights.

Rather than graze across the field I would prefer to illustrate the types of concerns by reference to the recent history of the Human Rights and Equal Rights and Opportunities Commission (HREOC).

In 1993 the Coalition went to John Hewson's 'fightback' election with a position that the Coalition in government would abolish the Human Rights Commission. That proved to be a very unpopular position. So unpopular that the new leader of the then Opposition, Mr Howard, adopted a more subtle and characteristically clever change in how to approach the question of this troublesome

creature. As the Coalition went into the 1996 election what they did was this. There was a very public guarantee that the Human Rights and Equal Rights and Opportunities Commission would be retained — which they honoured. But what they did not say was that in the first budget they would cut the Commission's funding by 40%.

Then there were some key personnel changes — and more than a few raised eyebrows with the new appointments. Though it should be said that people who may look like they are prime government appointees, sometimes surprise us. This has been the case with the Commission and with some on the ABC Board as well. These fair-minded people of goodwill move into these jobs and you see a

slow changing of their attitude and approach and, lo and behold, some of the appointments which had us thinking "Oh, oh!" have actually shown great integrity. Fortunately, integrity and courage will be found among people of widely varying political perspectives. Moreover, wherever any one of us might start from, provided we do keep an open mind, we can learn and grow and change. That is

one of the nice things about human nature, isn't it? Even so, integrity in itself is not always enough.

I suspect most would agree that the Human Rights Commission doesn't pack the punch it once did. But how could it: it's been starved of funds, subject to ongoing review and operating not only without the public support of the Government that has mandated it but subject to constant pressure.

Its talons have been cut. Why kill the beast under the public gaze when you can cripple and maim it behind closed doors? Either way it's no longer a threat.

One of the ways in which this has been done is through the clever use of the legislative process. This Government has very successfully employed this method in a number of areas: basically, they have a pet piece of legislation which is provocative and almost appears to be designed (or I assume it is) to provoke a public response. It can be a matter of general disinterest (of seemingly technical or bureaucratic nature) but is almost always a divisive issue harnessing public fear and insecurity to

http://www.hrca.org.au/CCJP.htm 15/12/2003

Australian Democracy

Page 11 of 32

push the wedge between the community and the demonised chattering classes deeper still. The thinking appears to be that if it gets through they would be rubbing their hands and saying, `Isn't this fantastic. We have got more than we could have dreamed of'. If it doesn't get through, it still serves a very good political purpose in attracting a lot of attention, forcing the Opposition (on those occasions they choose to act in opposition), those organisations directly affected, NGOS and other dissenting groups to tie up a lot of time, energy and resources just in responding — trying to hold the line. It's been a particularly successful strategy in the rolling series of security legislation: no matter

how much of each Bill has been passed, the rejected measures will be tabled again, and again. And when these are all accepted there are always some new measures just waiting to be introduced. An evident attraction in this strategy is its usefulness in avoiding the political heat for it is striking how often contentious legislation emerges when the Government is under pressure.

In the case of the Human Rights Commission, there has been a succession of bills proposing significant changes to its founding legislation, the Human Rights and Equal opportunity Commission Act 1986. On 27 March this year the Attorney General introduced into Parliament the Australian Human Rights Commission Legislation Bill 2003. This was the third attempt to re-structure the

Commission:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The first attempt commenced in 1996 flowed into 1997 and remained under consideration till the adjournment of the second reading in June 1997. This "1997 Bill" eventually lapsed prior to commencement of the 39th  Parliament in October 1998.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The second attempt was heralded with the introduction of the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill (no. 2) on April 8, 1998. It was still in the process of review by the relevant Senate Committee when the 1998 election was called. It too lapsed only to be resurrected after the election and again referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee. This attempt

also failed.

The 2003 Bill repeats the most contentious aspects of the previous attempts. However, the most interesting aspect for the purposes of this discussion concerns the Commission's ability to intervene in court proceedings.

Since its establishment in 1986 the Commission has had the power to seek leave of the court to intervene (that is, make representations) in cases raising human rights or discrimination issues. Interventions have been among the Commission's most important functions though the Commission has been discerning in its use, having sought and received permission to intervene on just 35 occasions. Its interventions have proved important and have been expressly recognised by the courts, including the High Court.

The decision to seek leave to intervene remains the responsibility of the Human Rights Commission itself and permission remains subject to the approval of the court; it is left to the judges, to say that the Commission can or cannot appear in this case, can or cannot make representation. So till this point it has been at the absolute discretion of the Commission itself to seek leave and the subsequent determination of the courts as to whether leave would be granted.

Given its responsibilities, it is not surprising that in a number of cases the Commonwealth Government of the day has itself been a party. It is this fact that gives rise to our interest in the current Government's attempt to make any decision to seek leave to intervene subject to the approval

of the Attorney General. The Government included similar provisions in its earlier attempt to amend the Commission's legislation. On that occasion the Senate Committee recommended unanimously against the proposal. The Government amended the then Bill accordingly. The attempt now to return

http://www.hrca.org.au/CCJP.htm 15/12/2003

Australian Democracy

Page 12 of 32

to the earlier discredited and rejected position appears to some to be inexplicable. This proposal is essentially no different from the earlier one.

What prompted the Government's decision to renege on its agreement to remove this provision? While we can't be certain, it is difficult not to be struck by the fact that between the lapsing of the second and introduction of the third Bill, the Commission sought and received permission from the Courts to intervene in two cases of special interest to the Commonwealth. In the first, the Ashmore

Reef Inquest 13 , the Attorney General actually opposed the Commission's application for leave in the court. The second case involved the right of people with a transsexual history to marry AJ and in this case the Commonwealth itself was a party.

What we do know is that when the legislation was reintroduced, the original clauses with respect to power to intervene were reinserted. We also know that, regardless of the reasons, the Commonwealth's proposal seeks to gut the Commission by further limiting its independence. It represents a clear breach of the relevant international standards. [ 15J The Commission itself is

gamely resisting the proposed changes arguing that they would compromise its independence, constrain its ability to raise important human rights issues, pre-empt the authority of the courts, and represent a potential conflict of interest for the Commonwealth. j 16]_

The intervention power is not the only aspect of the 2003 legislation to arouse concern, nor is the Human Rights Commission the only such body to attract the Government's ire. Its treatment is merely symptomatic of a Government that demonstrates a zero tolerance for dissent.

GOVERNMENT'S RELATIONSHIP WITH THE NON-GOVERNMENT SECTOR

All the institutions and agencies we've considered thus far are in one way or another directly connected to Government whether constitutionally, by statute or direct authority. You would expect the capacity of the Government of the day to extend its control over such bodies to be considerable. By contrast, you might expect that the limits of Government power would be more clearly evident when looking at the non-government sector. After all this Government has strongly endorsed the role of civil society and indeed the Prime Minister himself has staked a broad claim to the establishment of a new social coalition in which Government was but one player amongst several with the

corporate sector and the community being essential partners.

At this point we do need to be careful. It is very risky and I think it is a bit too easy for people like us, or certainly people like me, to slip into conspiracy theories. We can see a bit here and a bit there and sometimes we can join the dots only to find the picture isn't really what we expected. So with that caution, let's continue.

New Ways of doing Government Business

There has been a radical shift in the ways of doing Government business. It certainly goes back as far as the Hawke-Keating Governments and may go back even further. It has been driven by economic reform and associated reforms in the structure of government and the provision , of government services. Whether intended or not, when we look at the new ways of government doing

business, we clearly see a reinterpretation of the government/non-government relationship imposing

http://www.hrea.org.au/CCJP.htm 15/12/2003

Australian Democracy

tight constraints on the capacity for dissent.

I' m conscious that this is really boring stuff but let's look by way of example at the emergence of the so-called purchaser-provider split whereby the Government no longer provides a service itself but pays someone else to deliver the service on its behalf — as it has done with employment services.

The purchaser-provider framework is now common across Australian Governments of all political persuasions. It is not in itself a bad thing and many community organizations have adopted a positive approach. iJ Its proponents consistently argue that by separating responsibility for deciding which goods and services are provided to the community from the responsibility for delivering the services, the framework can improve accountability, transparency and efficiency. One of the difficulties is that these terms are generally interpreted very narrowly in terms of costs, the service delivery and the

defined contractual outcomes.] . The emphasis on efficiency focuses on purchasing the specified service at the lowest cost. That being the case, competition is an inherent feature of this market-based approach.

In contrast to the rhetoric about community development, increased social capital and cohesion, experienced community groups (increasingly backed by research) have now identified a range of problems associated with competitive tender. It has proved quite destructive at the local level, particularly in the area of human services where success largely depends on establishing and nurturing relationships not just between workers and their `clients' but between agencies.

Cooperation and collaboration becomes difficult when agencies are forced into direct competition for limited Government dollars. They become closed, reluctant to share information and increasingly territorial. This is certainly borne out by my own experience in working with communities to improve the educational and employment opportunities for young people. This is not an environment

conducive to openness and transparency.

However, the defining characteristic of the purchaser-provider framework lies in the way it redefines the relationship between the Government (as purchaser) and the non-government (as provider) parties. It is the nature of this contractual relationship that muddies the democratic waters.

One set of concerns revolves around the adequacy of parliamentary and public scrutiny of Government contracts. Commercial-in-confidence provisions and their use as defence for withholding information has been a recurring theme in reports from and addresses by Auditors-General at least since 1999..j19J Though the Senate under its Order on Agency Contracts has attempted to force disclosure, non-compliance remains prevalent according to subsequent review by the Australian National Audit Office. j20j

A second set of issues relate to the impact Government contracts have on the role, identity and operations of contracted non-government agencies. Few people seem to realise that these contracts make specific stipulations regarding the agency's use of the information it collects, its media and advocacy activities.

The contracts used by the different Departments do vary. They also change over time and we do have difficulty it getting hold of current contracts. All of which makes it hard to be definitive. Nevertheless, we know that contracts tend to include the following types of provisions:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ A requirement that all advertisements, publicity and promotion of the services be approved in advance by the purchasing Government Department.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ A requirement to actively promote Government policy and in some instances a specific prohibition against making any public comment that is, or may be interpreted to be, critical of the relevant Government program.

http://www.hrca.org.au/CCJP.htm 15/12/2003

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ A requirement that the relevant Minister must be invited to all public events and be allowed to designate a representative plus franchise-type requirements on signage, display of Government logos and supportive statements.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ A stipulation that access to sites, provision of information and/or research by third parties to be subject to approval by the contracting Department.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ A guarantee of access by Government officials to the agency's premises and files.

I can speak from my own experience of the impact such contracts have on access to information. We work, for example, with community agencies and with young people and we want to know (within the bounds of privacy) where they are going — are they getting jobs? Are they going into apprenticeships? What is happening to them? Are the programs on offer meeting these young people's needs ? Even though most agencies are more than willing to share the information, they are

legally prohibited by the contract from providing it to a third party. Even when they provide such information back to the government, we've found on at least one occasion that the Department didn't aggregate all the findings; on other occasions, it doesn't release the information. It certainly doesn't publish them. It's very frustrating.

Such frustrations pale in significance when you take a step back to consider the net effect such contractual arrangements have on public knowledge, accountability, organised dissent and community activism. It raises substantive questions about the health of participatory democracy.

The questions are further compounded by the realisation that the contracts not only impose explicit restrictions but set the tone. Given that the non-government sector is increasingly financially dependent on government funding, and the Government's attitude to dissent and challenge is so abundantly clear, it should surprise no one that all but the bravest will be subdued if not silent in

speaking out publicly.

None of this is to deny that this new way of doing the business of government can deliver efficiencies and even improve services. It should not be a `baby and bathwater' situation and we do need to be little bit discerning. But there are clearly fundamental problems to be addressed: if the cost of these benefits is to be the corruption of our democratic values and the further erosion of trust

and cohesion in our communities, then the price is simply too high.

The Impact on Non-Government Organisations

I want to return to the matter, mentioned above, regarding the impact of these changes on the advocacy role of Non-Government Organisations (NGOs). While most NGOs would see themselves as advocates in one way or another, there is a distinction to be drawn between those who see

themselves primarily as charitable institutions or service providers, and those that might be broadly grouped as social justice agencies. I'm sure a number of you will have your own stories and experiences to draw on here and may have even noticed yourselves the increased difficulties in social justice campaigning in the current climate. I would like to explore that just a little further.

Over the latter decades of the 20 th  Century the role and importance of NGOs had grown to the point that we had assumed a general recognition and acceptance of their activism as a necessary ingredient in a healthy democracy. We had come to think that we had reached a point of maturity in working with successive Australian governments whereby differences could be put on the public table and

http://www.hrca.org.au/CCJP.htm 15/12/2003

Australian Democracy

Page 15 of 32

robustly debated without jeopardising access or incurring retribution. While we always knew that major differences remained as to how human rights would best be realised and protected, we had believed that our shared commitment to human rights principles and norms was beyond serious question. We were wrong.

Advocacy has become difficult for all, but for some their outspokenness has threatened, in several cases destroyed, their organisations. Our integrity, courage and determination are being put to the test. The assault on NGO advocates conforms to the familiar pattern: undermining their standing and credibility; creating division; limiting their capacity; engaging them in an energy-sapping legislative

slugging match.

The story can be told from various starting points. For me, it is the story of the Howard Government's knee-capping of representative peak bodies that I find particularly illuminating. It's a story we few at the Human Rights Council first noted some time ago, so I found it reassuring though

not encouraging when I recently stumbled on a paper by Marian Sawer at ANU providing a very sobering analysis largely confirming our own conclusions. 21

Beginning with its time in Opposition, the John Howard-led Coalition adopted a strategy targeting `special interest' groups as the faceless puppeteers manipulating Government policy and spending to the detriment of `ordinary Australians'. Peak bodies soon became the organisational face of these special interests. The wedge was in place and no sooner had the Coalition won Government than it was being hammered.

One of the first agencies to fall following the ascent to power of the Howard Government was the Australian Youth Policy and Action Coalition (AYPAC), a small peak organisation bringing together State youth sector peak bodies and national youth organisations. AYPAC had been supported by the Government in its role as a credible representative body on youth issues before being de-funded in June 1998. The timing of the decision was linked by some to AYPAC's criticism of Government youth policy in the lead up to the 1998 election.1222 . They struggled on till eventually closing their

doors on 28 May 1999.j23j

AYPAC was the key organised voice for young people on the national stage. Bodies that are organised and therefore capable of mounting collective action appear to be a common target. Yet it is this strength which has been exploited as a weakness in selling the Government's decision to the public. The message given out is that these bodies are barriers to the Government's access to

"ordinary people" and rather than having the message filtered through an intermediary the Government will talk face-to-face to the grassroots. So one minute AYPAC is de-funded and the next minute substantial funding is released for establishing a National Youth Roundtable. First conducted in 1999, the Youth Roundtable is an annual process bringing together some 50 individual young people who meet, form working groups to develop issue-based projects and present their work to Ministers. It's good stuff but the difference is clear. These are individuals, speaking for themselves, acting without organisational backing, and with no clout. Moreover, they are speaking

and operating within an explicitly government-controlled process.

The AYPAC experience is not an isolated example. Other peak organisations critical of this Government that have been de-funded include: the Australian Federation of Pensioners and Superannuants, National Shelter, and the Association of Civilian Widows.t24j The process extends

beyond the peak bodies. Networks like the Coalition of Australian Participating Organisations of Women (CAPOW) have also been de-funded [1997]; in that case following an unflattering NGO

http://www.hrca.org.au/CCJP.htm 15/12/2003

Australian Democracy

report to the UN. The process continues. In January this year, for example, the United Nations Association of Australia (UNAA) sent out an urgent national appeal for funds following the withdrawal of its grant from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.j25J_

Not all peak bodies have been sent to the wall. Others, like the Australian Council of Social Service (ACOSS), have had their funding severely cut and, using the purchaser-provider contract model, what's left comes with strings such as a requirement to provide the Government with 24 hours notice of any media release, submissions to be provided two weeks in advance of release, and veto over material containing departmental facts and figures.[26]

Then there is the unwritten law: organisational survival is at constant risk so be good. For those NGOs, large and small, that manage to retain Government funding there is the sure knowledge that criticism (most particularly public criticism) is made at a price. The result is increasing self-censorship and advocacy conducted in polite whispers. This conclusion is more difficult to document

though hints emerge in a study conducted by my Human Rights Council colleague, Sanushka Mudaliar, for her Honours thesis on the impact of the State on development NGOs.t211 Her general conclusion is that these NGOs are increasingly moving their approach, activities and operational structures into a governmental framework; in effect, being moulded by the nature of the changed relationship with Government. In very measured terms, she points to increased financial dependence,

and a diminishing of organisational independence and grassroots accountability. What is just as interesting about her work is the contrast between her unfolding analysis and the general declaration of their continuing independence by a number —though not all- of those NGO leaders interviewed.

At the same time as all this has been going on, the Government has been running its legislative gambit under the guise of updating the definition of what constitutes a "charity". This has attracted considerable media attention over the last couple of weeks with the Treasurer's release of the draft Charities Bill 2003.

It is worth remembering, however, that this process commenced over three years ago. It really took off with the Prime Minister's announcement on 18 September 2000 of the establishment of an inquiry into the Definition of Charities and Related Organisations. The now familiar stage was set when the PM said, "We need to ensure that the legislative framework in which [charities] operate is

appropriate to the modem social and economic environment". As one astute academic commentator noted a few months later: "Decoded, this may well be Howard-talk for applying the blowtorch to charities that step out of the Government's Dickensian comfort zone". j

This process, three years long and still going strong, is one no charity (however defined) could literally afford to ignore because what is at stake is who will and who will not be eligible for tax deductible status.

No one doubts that there are legitimate questions about the role of `charities' in contemporary Australia, the degree and manner of public funding support (whether directly through grants or indirectly through tax incentives), or the associated need for appropriate accountability. Many of the issues we're considering here do raise legitimate public policy issues; the dilemma is that the legitimate issue is being exploited for undisclosed purposes which strike us as being questionable, if not entirely unacceptable. As already suggested, at the heart of these matters is the question of bona

fides and the mounting evidence suggests that a significant, even primary, purpose here as elsewhere is to nobble any potential opposition.

http://www.hrca.org.au/CCJP.htm 15/12/2003

What's the evidence you may ask?

Firstly, the consistent pattern emerging across so many fields of public activity. Secondly, the tactics employed. Thirdly, the demonstrable impact in limiting individual liberties and collective action and in a heightened climate of unquestioning submissiveness in the face of perceived personal and national insecurity. And finally, in this case as in others is the emergence of the telltale signs of manipulating processes in order to impose greater government controls.

When it comes to the new Charities Bill the give-away is the fact that the Treasurer chose to disregard the key piece of advice from the Government's own committee of inquiry on the critical question of how to define a "charity'.f221 The Committee made clear its view that "charities should

be permitted to engage in advocacy on behalf of those they represent".

However, the Treasurer, on behalf of the Government proposes a very broad definition of what would disqualify an organisation as a charity for taxation purposes. Section 8 of the draft legislation states:

Disqualifying purposes (1) The purpose of engaging in activities that are unlawful is a disqualifying purpose. (2) Any of these purposes is a disqualifying purpose:

(a) the purpose of advocating apolitical party or cause; (b) the purpose of supporting a candidate for political office; (c) the purpose of attempting to change the law or government policy; if it is, either on its own or when taken together with one or both of the other of these purposes, more than ancillary or incidental to the other purposes of the entity concerned.

Let me remind you that the question here is not what the Government itself may choose or not choose to support but what recognition exists under the taxation arrangements for members of the public in choosing to support a not-for-profit organisation.

The argument has been put that if an NGO is through its advocacy representing the public voice they should be able to sink or swim on their own resources. The public is free to give or not give and the NGO remains free to say whatever they want: they just should not get money from the Government. It is a disingenuous argument given that tax-deductibility still relies upon individual donations; it still relies on having to solicit a response from the community. Indeed, the reverse is true. By establishing unequal tax treatment through the arbitrary determination that NGO advocates are ineligible for tax

deductible status knowingly puts them at a significant financial disadvantage. Moreover, it reinforces the message that alternative views, informed public dissent and policy debate are not valued in this democracy.

Support for our concerns is further evident when you consider the organisations already named as subjects of these tax changes: organisations like Oxfam (which is Community Aid Abroad), Amnesty International, Greenpeace, and the Worldwide Fund for Nature.j3J Troublesome but credible organisations each one of them. Tax deductibility has been a key component in the

sustainable financial base which these organisations have developed over a number of years. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer know full well that to change these goal posts would deal a substantial blow to these organisations as it would to any organisation. Political parties, corporations

http://www.hrca.org.au/CCJP.htm 15/12/2003

Australian Democracy

Page 18 of 32

and our wealthiest families have taught us that reliability in tax treatment is critical to sustainability and they jealousy protect their own standing in this respect. While the proposed changes would sorely wound the larger NGOs they will likely deliver a death-blow to smaller NGOs that simply don't have the reserves or sufficiently diversified funding base to adjust their finances in the time available.

For those of you who may still harbour some doubt as to the Government's true intentions I would offer one final piece of evidence. The Treasurer's announcement on the Charities Bill was accompanied by a further announcement that there was to be a further review of the accountability of NGOs. The Institute of Public Affairs (IPA) was appointed to conduct the inquiry. As one commentator aptly put it "choosing the IPA as reviewer of NGOs is like getting the ACTU to conduct an inquiry on behalf of government about labour-market laws".f3fl The IPA has waged a long-running paper war against NGOs for some years. The head of this IPA-led review, Gary Johns, has been a vocal opponent of NGOs and their legitimacy. He wrote as long ago as January 2002 that governments should not assist NGOs not grant them access to policy forums unless they have government defined `standing'. 32J Why choose the IPA to conduct the review when they are clearly anything but neutral on the subject?

In raising these particular matters I should point out that our own little organisation, the Human Rights Council of Australia, is totally unaffected because we have no tax deductibility, nothing. Our interests lie not in the financial repercussions but in the further deleterious effect on the structure and

capacity of civil society in this country.

Of course, it is proper for all of us involved in non-government organisations to be very clear about who we are, what we do and who we represent. Rather than laying claim to be more than we are I think we should, if anything, slightly understate what we lay claim to. With respect to our own

organisation for example we are always very, very clear (whether in our background literature or when appearing before a Senate Inquiry) to say there are nineteen members and we speak for ourselves and no-one else. You take what we say on the value of what we say. We make no claims to represent anyone other than ourselves. NGOs, however, are many and varied. Organisations like Amnesty can quite rightly claim to represent large sectors of the community and are quite legitimate

in saying so.

Any NGO worth its salt is aware of its responsibilities and meets its public and legal duties accordingly. Any NGO worth its salt goes well beyond what is necessary in being accountable to its members, to those who support it financially and to the community more broadly. Any NGO that is a vocal and effective advocate knows full well that it will attract more than its fair due of attention

from the powers that be and the media.

Any NGO engaged in advocacy knows full well that this Government will do whatever it can to silence them. We must not be cowered and we must not allow ourselves to be duped into giving undue legitimacy to pseudo-inquiries, to engaging in unproductive apologetics and to caving in to ill-intentioned calls for excessive levels of control cloaked as `accountability'. We must not allow ourselves to be divided. To approach this latest challenge as if it is a dialogue undertaken in good

faith, would be to delude ourselves.

THE WORKER'S DILEMMA: STANDING ALONE OR TOGETHER

http://www.hrca.org.au/CCJP.htm 15/12/2003

Australian Democracy

Page 19 of 32

Suspicion and enmity between Conservative Coalition Governments and the union movement are not new. The roots of this particular struggle run deep. They are both historical and ideological. Yet unions have a legitimate and rightful place in our society. Their contribution to the values, the character and the well-being of this nation are profound. They have collectively been staunch

advocates of our rights and, at times, the only effective means of their defence. They have served us all well in setting standards of pay and conditions of work that gave the rhetoric of an egalitarian Australia a modicum of reality.

To say all this is not to excuse the excesses displayed on occasion, the corruption that has at times discredited individual unions, and the bullying tactics that have sometimes tarnished the reputation of the broader labour movement.

The question for us is not just whether unions have on balance been for the good or to the detriment of the nation. For workers have a fundamental right and interest in being organised and properly represented and in having a collective voice. Over the latter half of the 20 th  Century it appeared that there was agreement on that much at least and Governments of all persuasions proved capable of

coming to a workable if at times turbulent accommodation. Unions were recognised as being a critical "part of the system".

Therein lies the fundamental difference when it comes to the Howard Government's ascendancy. What has been sold to us as an inevitable consequence of globalisation and the imperative to modernise the Australian economy, on closer scrutiny appears to display disturbing conformity to the pattern of authoritarian control emerging across the political landscape.

This Government has systematically and persistently worked to erase unions from the system altogether. Despite its claims to the contrary, the record suggests that this Government offers no effective recognition of a worker's rights and interests in collective action. This clock is being

relentlessly turned back. In the same way that the existence of an institution like the Human Rights Commission can be tolerated when it stands powerless, there is no need to waste time and energy propounding that unions be abolished when you can proclaim their right to life while expunging them from the industrial and political eco-system. There are fewer and fewer Government tables at which you will find a place left for worker representatives. At times it seems almost petty as I know myself of cases where union representatives have been barred from study tours and seemingly

innocuous meetings.

It is in the industrial arena that the primacy accorded the individual is most clearly exposed as a shift in power. In the same way that the peak youth organisation AYPAC has been disembowelled on the pretext of enabling Government to talk directly to young people (as if these are mutually exclusive options), we are told that sidelining unions enables employers and individual workers to sort things

out face-to-face in the best interests of both. You might have thought it self-evidently ludicrous to suggest that putting the onus on the individual to negotiate alone as if that individual had the same capacity to stand up for her or himself as even 15,000 individuals let alone 300,000 have. Apparently not.

The Government's argument sounds mighty hollow at those times when employers and workers actually express a preference for entering into a collective agreement. Far from butting out, this Government goes to extraordinary lengths to impose its will. The attempt to threaten universities by tying funding to specific industrial reforms aimed at taking unions out of the picture is but the most recent example.[33J Fortunately, in this instance it appears that not all universities will be going

http://www.hrca.org.au/CCJP.htm 15/12/2003

Australian Democracy

Page 20 of 32

quietly.[34].

In the same way that Government ministers appear intent on undermining the legitimacy of those perceived to be standing in their way — be they members of the judiciary, the ABC or NGOs -Government leaders barrage us with generalised allegations of corruption, greed, and union leaders

divorced from their membership. No one is denying specific cases in which each of these allegations might truthfully apply but it is mischievous to tar whole unions and the labour movement with the same brush. The series of convictions of politicians for corruption, greed and illegal self-interest

(including electoral fraud) has not to my knowledge been accompanied by calls that Parliament be dissolved, let alone a suggestion that Parliamentary democracy has passed its use-by date.

In the same way that the legislative process has been exploited to tie up other potential dissidents, the union movement has been bogged down as an incessant series of legislative reforms have been introduced into the Parliament and, just to keep industrial advocates on their toes, more still have been mooted in speeches and interviews. The current batch of legislation includes the Workplace

Relations Amendment (Award Simplification) Bill, Workplace Relations Amendment (Choice in Award Coverage) Bill, Workplace Relations Amendment (Codifying Contempt Offences) Bill, Workplace Relations Amendment (Compliance with Court and Tribunal Orders) Bill, Workplace Relations Amendment (Fair Termination) Bill, Workplace Relations Amendment (Approved Remedies for Unprotected Action) Bill, Workplace Relations Amendment (Protecting the Low Paid) Bill, and the Workplace Relations Amendment (Simplifying agreement-making) Bill.

The point in terms of this morning's discussion is this: let's not look at what is happening to Unions, and the way that that change has taken place, in isolation from everything else that has been going on. It is a much richer analysis if we understand that it is part and parcel of something bigger.

THE STATE AND THE INDIVIDUAL

Why would a Government that has built its credentials and electoral appeal on a philosophy espousing the primacy of the individual, small government and keeping State intervention to an absolute minimum, introduce far-reaching restrictions on personal freedoms, allocate to itself significant, new powers to directly intervene in the lives of all its citizens and even more so non-citizens falling under its jurisdiction, and ensure its capacity to do so by expanding the role and machinery of the relevant arms of Government exponentially? This is the paradox which more than

any other set alarm bells ringing for me.

You may think that the most striking manifestation of this lies in the raft of measures introduced in the context of the `war on terror'. You would be right but I don't want to start there because these measures are simply the latest and most far-reaching. To concentrate on those measures alone would be to understate the case. Just the same time is running out so I'll be brief.

Mutual Obligation

The long, slow march of Welfare Reform has focused considerable attention on questions of reciprocity: the notion that the individual "owes" society for any social benefits he or she might receive. The long march, beginning in earnest in the early 1990s under Labor, gathered pace with the current Government's mutual obligation policy and subsequent welfare reform review. The notion of

http://www.hrca.org.au/CCJP.htm 15/12/2003

Australian Democracy Page 21 of 32

mutual obligation has popular appeal tapping as it does into the longstanding stigma of `dole bludgers' and their ilk.

Several years ago Pam Kinnear at ANU dissected the philosophical underpinnings of the mutual obligation approach in a very thoughtful paper for the Australia Institute. She concluded that:

... the ethical foundations of the Howard Government's Mutual Obligation policies do not stand up to scrutiny, and ...the way the idea of mutual obligation is currently being used in public debate misrepresents the philosophical traditions of which it clams to be a part. [This paper] also finds that the broad appeal of the mutual obligation principle is based on a

number of popular misconceptions about the nature of unemployment in Australia..

In effect, mutual obligation has reversed the onus of responsibility: shifting the burden of economic reform from those who clearly benefit to those whose disadvantage is a direct result of the reforms in question. It is a fundamental re-writing of the long-standing social contract which has seen the notion

of `entitlement' expunged. Pam Kinnear argues that, "Mutual Obligation policies may be the manifestation of moral decline, rather than the answer to it".

You need not go so far in your conclusions to agree that mutual obligation has wrought a dramatic change in the relationship between the individual and the State. Under its umbrella, there is an unprecedented level of compulsion, of State supervision of personal behaviour, of official judgement of that behaviour, and of mandatory punitive measures consequential upon any such judgement. Moreover, community agencies have become paid agents of the State in the administration of these

controls. Under mutual obligation only the individual's obligations are so tightly defined, supervised and regulated.

The push for Welfare Reform was boosted by the cleverly crafted McClure Report whose title held out the promise of participation support for a more equitable society.] J It went a long way in legitimating the Government's policy thrust with its appealing emphasis on participation and equity.

Unfortunately, it failed to question let alone seriously challenge the basis of such a policy; for some I know the compromise was based upon the good-intentioned desire to mitigate the impact upon the unemployed, the disabled, and families struggling to keep their heads above water. The best intentions were reflected in a series of recommendations which may have well made life at least a little easier. While these recommendations have never been implemented, we are left with a welfare

system based on a radical re-writing of those previously core values of an equitable and egalitarian society in which not just the responsibilities but the risks and the benefits are also shared. In the process the State has become more intrusive and more demanding. As a society we are that much less inclusive.

National Security

The world may not have changed on September 11 but our perception of it almost certainly did. The destruction of the Twin Towers and the October 2002 horror of the Bali bombings have disturbed us all deeply. We feel under threat. Our sense of personal safety is challenged. Our confidence in our security is shaken.

Yet in a democracy we are not just entitled but duty bound to question and challenge our political leaders. We must assure ourselves that the responses to these catastrophic events are fully informed, justified, proportionate and likely to be effective. We must ensure that the nature of our defence of our democratic values does not in fact corrupt the very values we seek to protect. More

fundamentally still, as citizens, we must question to ensure we have a real say in where our country is heading.

http://www.hrca.org.au/CCJP.htm 15/12/2003

Australian Democracy

Page 22 of 32

At the Human Rights Council we have felt ill at ease with the way in which the raft of security legislation has been hastily drafted and subsequently pushed through Parliament. Proper consideration of the need for additional powers was forestalled initially by the Government's creation of a climate of fear-induced urgency. Any question was met with contempt. Any one raising

a question faced accusations of being terrorist sympathisers. Genuine informed debate was effectively shut down.

As we have seen in other areas of contentious reform, the sheer volume and pace of new legislative proposals has itself proved a significant barrier to considered policy-making. There is no apparent end to the introduction of new legislation or the mooting of new measures across a vast range of possibilities. Communicating or making an "official record of information" available should be

subject to detention.L:7j ASIO needs powers to detain and question journalists.j38]_ Only Government approved lawyers should be allowed in certain security cases. ASIS officers need to be armed. People suspected of posing a threat should have their telephone and internet services cut off. L391 Even now barely a day goes by when there is not some suggestion from a Minister or security official of further measures that are may be needed.

While a number of the proposed measures have been held up in Senate inquiries or rejected (though still being pursued by the Government), even a cursory scan of the security-related Acts passed into law over the last two years provides an indication of the level of legislative activity:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Intelligence Services Act 2001 No. 152, 2001 Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Intelligence Services (Consequential Provisions) Act 2001 No. 153, 2001 Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Security Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Act 2002 No. 65, 2002 Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Suppression Of The Financing Of Terrorism Act 2002 No. 66, 2002 Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Telecommunications Interception Legislation Amendment Act 2002 No. 67, 2002 Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Criminal Code Amendment (Terrorism) Act 2003 No. 40, 2003 Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Crimes Legislation Enhancement Act 2003 No. 41, 2003 Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Terrorism Insurance Act 2003 No. 43, 2003 Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Criminal Code Amendment (Hizballah) Act 2003 No. 44, 2003

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Act 2003 No. 77, 2003 And this list doesn't include related legislation such as that concerning border protection.

To a very large extent it is only after this considerable body of legislation is passed into law that we are able to more thoroughly assess its implications. Earlier this year, the Human Rights Council solicited its own review of the new anti-terrorism laws..[4QJ That review identified, as others had, a

number of significant concerns ranging from the broad definition of a `terrorist act' and related `terrorism offences' through to specific provisions such as those allowing incommunicado detention for the first 48 hours, restricting a detainee's access to a lawyer, a requirement that all questions be answered and the `special rules' applying to young people.

Then, in June this year, the Federal Parliament passed the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2003. It provided additional powers to the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation which include provisions for:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ detaining suspects for questioning for up to 7 days without charges Ã¢ÂÂ¢ detaining people known to be innocent of any offence on the basis that they may have information which would assist ASIO Ã¢ÂÂ¢ detaining people as young as 16 for questionning

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ further restricting detainees access to lawyers

http://www.hrca.org.au/CCJP.htm 15/12/2003

Australian Democracy

Page 23 of 32

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ denying detainees contact with family or anyone else Ã¢ÂÂ¢ imprisonment of people for up to five years for refusal to cooperate or surrender information Ã¢ÂÂ¢ imprisonment of lawyers for up to five years for communicating any information about their client's detention or questioning

The combined effect of these, and other measures, is a very dramatic erosion of our individual civil liberties, a radical departure from the existing standards of due process, and a fundamental shift in the balance between the power of the State and the individual.

The marked increase in the security powers available to the State have been accompanied by a similarly dramatic increase in the capacity of the security, intelligence and law enforcement agencies to utilise those powers. ASIO, for example, have received an additional $24.5 million over the next four years and there is a $9 million capital injection taking this year's Budget allocation to $95.356m. As Denis Richardson, ASIO's Director General puts it, "We have received a significant net increase in our bottom line".41 ]_ Explaining the purposes for this increase he said, "It is a mix of

an expansion of our overseas liaison, an increase in our analytical and collection capability and also funding to enable us to do vetting, security assessments, in the civil aviation area".[421 It's not easy getting beyond such generalities when the Government itself unblushingly tells us that the information provided in the ASIO Budget Statement has necessarily been limited by the need to observe the requirements of national security. 43

Of course, ASIO is just the tip of the security Budgetary iceberg. It doesn't include, for example, the Defence Intelligence agencies, ASIS, ONA or the new Special Operation Command. We can safely say that there is nothing small about this arm of Government.

You might reasonably expect that human rights activists and civil libertarians would be dismayed by this turn of events. But doesn't it strike you as strange that a supposedly liberal, conservative government would be the architect of this radical intrusion by the State on the freedom of the individual?

Other conservatives do appear to be perplexed. One Nation Senator Len Harris delivered one of the more cogent and passionate speeches during the Parliamentary debate opposing the ASIO Bill. 44] One Nation is not a natural ally for a group like ours and there is a too easy temptation to dismiss their concerns as just another hysterical conspiracy theory. One Nation for all its faults did teach us

something about political arrogance: I read Senator Harris's address and cannot help but think that on this occasion he is right.

Border Protection

About a year ago I was copied in on an email sent by the organisers of one of the refugee support networks. After sharing the latest news, they wrote:

On a sombre note, we have had a request from several sources that we stop using detainees' names in emails between ourselves. Please just use initials. No matter how well-intentioned we might be, there have been incidents where the safety of the detainees organisations like us are trying to help have been compromised. The realities of the world we live in...

There is a great deal I could say at this stage but I determined not to dwell on the question of asylum seekers and border protection in this paper. Many of you are very familiar with these issues and would I expect readily see the parallels with the issues and approaches I have been sketching today as they pertain to other developments. I raise it here in the context of the changed relationship between the State and the individual because one of the most damning aspects of our treatment of

http://www.hrca.org.au/CCJP.htm 15/12/2003

Australian Democracy

Page 24 of 32

asylum seekers is the de-humanisation of those involved. We not only deny these people their rights, but we deny their humanity. Then we construct elaborate arguments about border protection and national security, to justify the callous, ill-treatment we dish out. So while wanting simply to raise the question in this context, I will confine myself to one or two brief points.

Firstly, I would urge you to read David Marr and Marion Wilkinson's book, Dark Victory. Their exposition of what the book cover calls "John Howard's campaign against boat people" gives a very detailed insight into many of the issues raised in other contexts today..[ ) One of the things that really shocked me about the Marr/Wilkinson book is that it had so little political impact. An

extended, corroborated analysis that detailed so forensically what public servants, ministers and advisors did in denial of their basic democratic obligations sank with barely a splash. I was stunned by it.

Secondly, I would again stress that we need to look beyond any single issue (in this case border protection) if we are to fully appreciate the extent to which our core democratic values and human rights are being eroded.

THE DEMISE OF INTERNATIONAL CITIZENSHIP

The activities of this Government have not gone entirely unnoticed. In the two-year period 1998-2000, for example, the government attracted criticism by every one of the United Nation's six human rights treaty committees for shortcomings in its performance:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ by the Human Rights Committee established under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, in relation to mandatory sentencing of offenders and mandatory detention of unauthorised arrivals Ã¢ÂÂ¢ by the Committee established under the International Covenant on Economic Social and

Cultural Rights, in relation to indigenous disadvantage Ã¢ÂÂ¢ by the Committee established under the Convention Against Torture and other forms of Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, for its treatment of asylum seekers and conditions in prisons, especially for indigenous people

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ by the Committee established under the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination, in relation to native title, mandatory sentencing and criminal justice generally, past policies of removing children and reconciliation

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ by the Committee established under the Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination Against Women, for perceived downgrading of women's rights Ã¢ÂÂ¢ by the Committee established under the Convention on the Rights of the Child, in relation to the mandatory sentencing of children.

As the former Human Rights Commissioner commented at that time: Government ministers have railed against these committees. They have complained that the committees are biased against Australia, that they do not know the facts, that they rely too much on non-government organisations and that they pay too little heed to the views of a democratically elected government. People in Asia point out in amazement that these are the arguments of their own repressive governments when their countries' performances are criticised [471

The Government's displeasure was evident in the Prime Minister's address to the Millennium Summit at UN Headquarters in September 2000 where he dedicated a good part of his brief speech to a call for reform of the UN treaty committee system noting that "Australia's recent experience has

http://www.hrca.org.au/CCJP.htm 15/12/2003

Australian Democracy

Page 25 of 32

been that some of these committees give too little weight to the views of democratically-elected governments and that they go beyond their mandates".j48j

The situation has not improved in the three years since this falling out. International criticism has persisted to the extent that Australia's longstanding international leadership on human rights has been called into serious question.t49J Our Government's response has been to continue its attacks on the treaty committee system, to maintain pressure for reforms (apparently more out of a desire to

de-stabilise their work than out of a desire to strengthen their capacity), to obstruct the committees' scrutiny of Australia and to reject any suggestion that Australia may be defaulting on its human rights obligations.

Professor Spencer Zifcak in his paperer on the "new anti-internationalism" cites a number of recent examples:

The Government delayed for more than two years the visit of the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention which wished to examine conditions in immigration detention facilities. The Group was finally permitted to visit in 2002 in association with the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights' envoy, Justice Bhagwati, whose visit was similarly

delayed for months. The reasoned and critical reports of both were subsequently rejected out of hand by the Government later that year.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Australia failed to ratify the Optional Protocol on the Convention against Torture in July 2002. The amendment would have permitted UN representatives to visit member states' prisons and detention centres without first requesting permission. Countries which voted against the amendment were China, Cuba, Egypt, Japan, Libya, Nigeria and Sudan, not

company Australia is normally accustomed to keeping.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The `Pacific Solution' has been a conscious attempt to evade Australia's responsibilities under the International Convention on the Status of Refugees. It may be that the Convention is in urgent need of review but this fact does not make such evasion and the deliberate ill-treatment and disentitlement of applicants for refugee status in far-away camps any more justifiable.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ In December 2002, Australia became the last Western nation not to support the incorporation of a right to self-determination in a new UN statement on the rights of indigenous peoples.

Professor Zifcak, and others, have established a clear pattern in which the current Government harries the UN over any matter that impinges on Australia's own activities or interests. Any criticism is rejected out of hand without any semblance of due consideration.

The Government's retreat behind claims of national sovereignty and its status as being democratically elected are dangerous. Firstly, because it is clearly a retreat from the evolving post-war consensus on the universality of human rights and the body of international human rights norms and laws that have been developed over the last fifty years. Secondly, because it legitimates the exact

same arguments used by those States that are guilty of gross human rights violations; indeed, it strengthens their resistance to legitimate international standards. Thirdly, because it weakens the capacity of other democratic governments to collectively pursue a progressive international agenda and further weakens the capacity of the UN itself to do its job properly. Finally, because it further undermines the accountability of our own Government and in so doing undermines the protection

and exercise of human rights by those under its jurisdiction — citizens and non-citizens alike.

This is a radical policy shift at odds with Australia's long-standing commitment to good international citizenship. It represents a fundamental philosophical change in how we see ourselves and where Australia sits in the world. This shift in policy further weakens human rights protection at home,

leaving ajar the door to the abuse of power with such abuses being increasingly difficult to substantiate if detected at all.

THE STATES OF THE NATION

Someone came up to me in the break and said to me: `You are concentrating very much on the Federal government. Some of the State governments aren't clean in this.' This is a really important point and one that I had planned to address.

I have concentrated on developments at the Commonwealth level because the changes are most profound at that level and are still gathering pace. Moreover, the Commonwealth is very much setting the tone and the broader political agenda. It would be wrong, however, to suggest that the Howard Government is the sole villain of this piece. It is important to remember that at least some of these concerns have their roots in reforms during the Hawke-Keating Labor Governments. Changes

in the way government does business (such as the purchaser-provider model) and the `politicisation' of the public service would be two examples.

At the same time, the State and Territory Governments do warrant attention because they are picking up this ball and, to varying degrees, running with it. State Governments, for example, have certainly exacerbated the situation with respect to undermining the judiciary, particularly by pandering to public opinion on judicial decisions and the increasing use of mandatory sentencing.

Even though we knew this, I have to say we were taken aback when we received Jessica Wyndham's brief on current anti-terrorism legislation that I mentioned earlier. j5 lJ The State Premiers had agreed at a COAG meeting in April 2002 to support the package of Federal legislation by their own legislation `referring' power to the federal Parliament to legislate on the issue of terrorism. They have all subsequently done so.

What we were shocked to discover, however, was that the New South Wales Government's legislation, Terrorism (Commonwealth Powers) Bill 2002 (NSW), was supplemented by a further piece of legislation, Terrorism (Police Powers) ACT 2002.

The object of this second Act is to give special power to police officers to deal with terrorist acts and to give police officers additional powers to protect people in emergencies. The Act provides for a police officer to give an authorisation that certain special powers may be exercised in an effort to prevent an imminent terrorist act or to investigate a terrorist act in the immediate period after its

occurrence. These special powers are:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ To obtain disclosure of identity (section 16); Ã¢ÂÂ¢ To search persons (section 17); Ã¢ÂÂ¢ To search vehicles (section 18); Ã¢ÂÂ¢ To enter and search premises (section 19); and Ã¢ÂÂ¢ To seize and detain things (section 20).

An authorisation may be given by the Commissioner of Police or by a Deputy Commissioner of Police or by a police officer above the rank of superintendent in the instance that neither the Commissioner nor Deputy Commissioner are able to be contacted in a matter of urgency. (Section 8) The Police Minister must provide his or her concurrence. (Section 9).

http://www.hrca.org.au/CCJP.htm 15/12/2003

Australian Democracy

Page 27 of 32

Schedule 1 to the Act provides for how personal searches are to be conducted. Frisk searches, ordinary searches and strip searches are provided for under the provisions of the Act. The "privacy and dignity" of the person being searched must be respected "as far as is reasonably practicable in the circumstances". (Section 5)

Section 6(3) provides that searches can be carried out on children from the age of 10.

A strip search of a child who is at least 10 years of age but under 18 years of age, or of a person who has impaired intellectual functioning, must, unless it is not reasonably practicable in the circumstances, be conducted in the presence of a parent or guardian of the person being searched or, if that is not acceptable to the child or person, in the presence of another person (other than a police officer) who is capable of representing the interests of the person and who, as

far as it practicable in the circumstances, is acceptable to the person.

Section 7 provides that: "A strip search must not be conducted on a person who is under the age of 10 years". This express limitation leaves open the ability to frisk or conduct an ordinary search on a child of any age.

Section 22 makes it an offence to obstruct or hinder a search or the exercise of other powers under the Act. The maximum penalty is 100 penalty units or imprisonment for 2 years or both. Under Section 33 the onus of proof of 'reasonable excuse' in proceedings for an offence against the Act or the regulations lies on the person accused of the offence.

In other words, the NSW legislation goes even further than the Commonwealth's. In fact, a number of the provisions now law in NSW (such as strip searching children as young as 10) were excised from the Howard Government's original Bill due to the Opposition of the NSW Labor Government's Federal colleagues. The NSW Act is an appalling piece of legislation which slipped through the net while the gaze of the media, lawyers, NGOs and the public was focused elsewhere. It is a sobering lesson.

The NSW Government reflects national developments in other ways too. The Premier Bob Carr's denigration of the NSW Anti-Discrimination Board following its report Race for the headlines: racism and media discourse comes to mind. The ADB's modest $3.2m Budget was subsequently slashed (23% this financial year and an additional 30% next year).

We have not had the capacity ourselves for a more considered analysis of relevant developments in the respective States & Territories. What we do see suggests there is more to know. The symptoms being displayed in NSW may be indicative of an even deeper malaise. If State and Territory Governments simply fall easily into line behind the directions being mapped by Canberra then we

lose a major check to the balance of power in Australia.

CONCLUSION

I have sometimes wondered just how many of those living in 1948 were even aware of the proclamation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in December that year. It was more than two decades later when, as a teenager, I first came across it myself. Even then, I found it hard to

imagine how something so beautiful, so life-affirming and optimistic, could have emerged from the abject misery and horrifying inhumanity of the Second World War.

This is not the place to elaborate on the evolution over the last fifty-five years of a genuinely international human rights framework. However, it is critical for us to remember that this framework

http://www.hrca.org.au/CCJP.htm 15/12/2003

Australian Democracy

Page 28 of 32

is much more than a matter of international law. It articulates fundamental and internationally agreed values. It sets down standards and norms of behaviour. It also gives rise to a range of measures for the promotion, protection and realisation of our rights.

We have learnt a great deal over the last fifty-five years. One of the key lessons is that we must never take the enjoyment and exercise of our rights for granted. Another is that the erosion of democratic values under the many guises of national security will, if left unchecked, too often prove a precursor to the suppression and abuse of human rights. The third lesson flows from these two: the

early identification of these emerging threats is the most crucial step in the prevention of human rights abuse.

What we know and what we don't

It is close on two years now since we at the Human Rights Council of Australia first did a rudimentary mapping of key changes affecting human rights in Australia. We were struck then by the range of policy areas and activity that were exerting an impact on our individual freedoms and indeed our collective rights. I have attempted in this paper to give a flavour of the nature and the range of the issues we have identified.

In the light of further research, we began to faintly discern certain patterns. Perhaps the most clearly delineated was the pattern of Government behaviour which we dubbed the "characteristics of a new authoritarianism". You could say this is the Government's methodology for driving the political changes arousing our concern. I have highlighted several of these key characteristics during the

course of this address. They would certainly include:

1. Creating a political climate dominated by fear, insecurity and division.

2. De-legitimating dissent (including, for example, through the demonisation of those putting alternative positions)

3. Limiting the capacity of "other voices" (including, for example, by restricting functional capacity [resources] and their public standing)

4. Controlling access to and the use of information.

5. Co-opting or even coercing potential dissenters (including, for example, through exploiting increasing financial dependence and the use of contractual provisions).

Clearly the extension of Government authority is stifling, though not yet extinguishing, the capacity not only for dissent but for the formulation of, and advocacy for, different policies and practices. It is smothering our ability as citizens to consider alternatives and to make informed choices. The white-anting, and in some cases dismantling, of our key institutions weakens our democracy and may ultimately see more autocratic structures imposed upon us.

What we really are not sure about is whether this emerging authoritarianism is witting or unwitting; whether it has emerged as an unintended consequence of a particular inclination to the way government should operate which is about narrowly defined economic efficiencies and effectiveness; or whether it is actually the desired outcome of a Government so utterly convinced in the correctness

of its own view of the world that it prizes the acquisition and exercise of power to impose that worldview above all else and to the exclusion of any alternative worldview.

I would go so far as to say that I do believe (contrary to the often stated assumptions about our

http://www.hrca.org.au/CCJP.htm 15/12/2003

Australian Democracy

Page 29 of 32

"shared Australian values") that our analysis is exposing an underlying clash of values which is perhaps recognised but poorly articulated. If it is a cultural issue then the cumulative effect we are describing could be understood as a natural (though not necessarily a pre-determined) consequence

of a particular mindset. To that extent it could be understood as ideological.

In plain English: let's not jump to simplistic, convenient conspiracy theories when there are other less sinister and perfectly valid explanations.

While we may not have come to a firm conclusion on this question of primary intent, we are firmly convinced that our rights and associated core democratic values are under threat.

I really don't wish to over-dramatise the situation. We are not suggesting that Australia today is some sort of elaborate police State. Ours is still a great country and God knows there is much for us to celebrate. But what we do see are the germinating seeds of a quite fundamentally different and increasingly authoritarian State. If so, we will need to understand just what is happening if we are to confront it.

Where do we go from here

For our part at the Human Rights Council we are continuing to do what we can to research and further analyze this unfolding story. We will be doing more to make our findings widely available. We have already commenced work on putting together some recommendations and ideas for appropriate action.

In this respect, we would argue that there is a great deal that could and should be done:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Individually, we should be challenging our own elected representatives more: bringing our concerns and relevant information to their direct attention. Asking more questions. Seeking their opinions on their own Party's policy. Asking what they are doing to represent our views in the Party room and to Government leaders. If you feel so inclined send your local member a copy of this paper requesting not just their response but information that might clarify or refute the issues it raises. We should certainly be using Parliamentary processes more effectively.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ We should be more informed and vocal in the public discourse: from talkback to the workplace. While extensive information may circulate among our own networks, it doesn't necessarily make it into the wider public domain. We should in some cases expect more of the organisations we belong to or support.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ We might also encourage and support NGOs, including those to which we belong, to consider these issues, review their own circumstances and practices. Much can be done. Peak organisations and the larger NGOs across the sectors, for example, could well consider a joint position on contracts: refusing to sign contracts requiring the vetting of media releases, promotion of Government policies and the prohibition on advocacy as a matter of principle. They might well negotiate from an agreed set of contractual principles which might include, for

example, a provision that all program information (including Government evaluations) should be publicly available subject only to privacy requirements. The Government is no longer capable of maintaining nor delivering services itself which must leave the major players in a fairly strong negotiating position provided they act collectively. It may be worth recalling the impact of the

http://www.hrca.org.au/CCJP.htm 15/12/2003

1962 Goulbourn School Strike.

We need ourselves to be more inclusive if are to seriously tackle these issues. They go to the heart of who we are as a nation affecting us all regardless of political orientation, education, or economic circumstance. The RSL, the Unions, organisations of all Faiths, the CWA, responsible corporations, all have a direct stake. We should avoid making assumptions about others and talk to them directly. There is much to learn from the Australian Campaign to Ban Landmines about inclusive action on matters of shared humanitarian concern.

We should seize this opportunity to take a longer-term view. Legislative reforms will be needed. I would include high on the list an Australian Bill of Rights. Not because it would cure all possible ills but because it would articulate for the first time an agreed set of national values. It would also act as a barrier to the quiet erosion of our rights by at least forcing any future

Government's actions in such matters out into the open. But the thing is we have to really want it. The ACT looks set to adopt the first Bill of Rights in this country and we should be looking to learn from their process.

There is a great deal to be done so I'd remind you that we are only nineteen already over-committed souls at the Human Rights Council and our little organisation is pretty well broke. So, for heaven's sake, don't wait for us!

Keeping our Eyes on the Prize

On Sunday February 16 this year in the lead up to the Iraq war, over 200,000 people in Sydney and hundreds of thousands more elsewhere in Australia took to the streets. I really don't think any one of us was under the illusion that this would in any way dampen the Prime Minister's determination to commit Australian troops, let alone force a re-consideration of the decision to join the US in this

escapade.

So why did so many Australians turn out?

One reason was a shared need to express their opposition to this war at least `for the record'. However, I have also thought that there was something more: it seemed to provide a focus for a very strong current of disquiet in our community. I don't wish to read too much into it but there was an

almost palpable sense of affirmation and relief in the peaceful almost celebratory air as the march progressed. Two hundred thousand sighs of "So I'm not the only one who feels like this. I am not alone." Could it be that many, many more of our compatriots are feeling uneasy about what is happening to them and what they see happening around them?

Do true blue Australians really want to see kids growing up behind razor wire? Desperate people turned back to sea? After two centuries of a healthy scepticism about authority and the ruling class, do they really like the idea that faceless security officers can listen in to their phone calls, invade their homes, lock up their kids or their neighbours on the mere scent of suspicion? Or to hold them in

detention in secret without even proper access to a lawyer simply for what they might know and not for what they themselves might have done? Do they really feel comfortable with the idea that any Australian Prime Minister or Government (Liberal, Labor, National, Green, Democrat or One Nation) might progressively eliminate effective opposition? Have we really become so fearful and

http://www.hrca.org.au/CCJP.htm 15/12/2003

Australian Democracy

Page 31 of 32

insecure that we will cede all this autho rity and more to the State? I don't believe so.

I do believe that fear and insecu rity may have momenta rily dulled our political senses and democratic instincts. I do believe that the wheel will tu rn. I see no reason whatsoever for any of us to lose faith in the Australian people.

It is this firm conviction that sustains our own work. For we know from expe rience that it is not enough for people to feel uneasy. We need to be able to understand and a rticulate what it is that is troubling us if we are to move decisively and effectively to action. It is our hope that this analysis will assist to do that in some small way.
