SOCIAL SECURITY POLICIES ENSURE BLEAK CHRISTMAS - UNLESS

1. In 1976 the Fraser Government, obsessed with its war against so-called  'dole bludgers1, decided to stop unemployment benefits to school  leavers who could not find jobs.. They are not paid until six weeks  after their final examination or when they leave school, whichever  is the later.  .

But, in spite of promises made by Senator Guilfoyle at the time, family  and student allowances are also stopped over this period. This year  family allowances finish up on the first or third Tuesday in December.

What are these teenage children to live on in their first six weeks of  unemployment?

How are parents supposed to feed grown young people with no les.s than  average appetites when the Department of Social Security,  which has  .  paid family allowances to those children since birth, cancels all  payments at the very time they need new clothes, transport and

telephone money to hunt for work, and food to sustain them for it?

Government members and senior public servants have no problems with the  policy. They can manage family holidays and lavish Christmas spending  without depending on social security payments.

It is poor families - including unemployed parents in Newcastle and Wollongong - who have to explain to their children that presents  and food are scarce.

Can even this Government derive satisfaction in saying a few thousand  dollars by leaving teenage school leavers stranded without family  allowances? .

If not, the Minister should order that payments be made until the end  of January so that their famililies have a marginally less bleak  Christmas. -

2. Another group of people to feel the chill wind of Fraser Government  policy are workers laid off during the annual Christmas/January shutÂ­ down of many works and factories.

Previously, if they had no entitlement to holiday pay they were  given unemployment benefit during January if they could not find casual  work.

But in 1978 Social Security scored another cost-cutting triumph by  refusing to pay it. So for four weeks while most Australian families,  live it up at Christmas, these unlucky workers were declared ineligible  for any social security payments unless they were down to their last  hundred dollars and eligible for special benefit,.

As Senator Chaney has agreed to pay workers agreeing to voluntary  retrenchment, he should reverse the 1978 decision before Christmas so  that workers whose factories have closed for summer holidays can also  receive unemployment benefit.

SICK PEOPLE WHO CAN'T GET SICKNESS BENEFITS

Encouraged by the success of its war on invalid pensioners, Senator  Chaney's Department is moving in against applicants for sickness  benefits.

Instructions have been issued limiting the definition of 'loss of  income'  and as a result the eligibility criteria for sickness  benefits have changed for the first time since sickness benefits  were introduced in 1945. .

This means:- .

.  sickness benefits can be paid at a rate lower than unemployment  benefit;

.  unemployed people who qualify on sickness grounds will not be  paid sickness.benefit unless they are already on unemployment  benefit;

.  sick or injured people who are self-employed in business or on  a farm will be paid only if a substitute is paid to do the work  and only as much as the substitute receives;

.  school leavers will not be paid sickness benefits if they fall  ill or have an accident before unemployment benefit becomes  payable at the end of January;

.  workers engaged in an industrial dispute do not qualify if  .  they sustain injuries while on strike or lock-out is on;

.  pensions no longer count as 'income'  for 'loss of income'  purposes,   though they count as 'income'  for taxation or means test purposes;

.  persons who have been reviewed off invalid pensions as only 80% .  incapacitated are no longer eligible for sickness benefits because  .  they have not suffered 'loss of income'. (You could have fooled  them. They have lost pension, supplementary assistance and

.  fringe benefits).

Ten days after the publicity about the denial of the right to sickness  benefit - a right unchallenged for 37 years - new instructions were sent  to all Social Security offices concerning the payment of special benefit  to people refused sickness benefit.

It is to be subject to an income test only, and, according to Senator  Chaney, "it is a more generous provision than is usually applied". That means, it does riot have to go to Canberra for determination and  assets do not have to be run down to the last $100' .

In all other ways its provisions are. ungenerous and unjust.  There is no  supplementary assistance. There are no fringe benefits.  Just as .   sickness beneficiaries have become entitled to fringe benefits,   applicants failing the sickness benefit criteria - not because they are  not sick enough but because Senator Chaney's Department is applying new

legal rules to exclude them - are being deprived of the right to  concessions. .

They lose pharmaceutical benefits, transport and telephone concessions,  and eligibility for pharmaceutical, dental and optical benefits.

-3-

Even worse, the special benefit income test is the harshest devised.   Beneficiaries lose $1 for every $1 earned or derived from bank  interest etc. Â·

Special beneficiaries normally have the same income test as unemployment  beneficiaries - that is now $10 a week allowable earnings and then a  loss of $1 for every $2 above that to $60 a week.

Senator Chaney's view of generosity is reminiscent of the former  Director-General, Mr. Lanigan1s remark that "people who are taken off  invalid pension and put on unemployment benefit suffer only  marginal inconvenience".  .

Special benefit, incidentally, will not be paid to persons whose grant  of unemployment benefit is postponed. Whatever illness or injury  happens to an unemployed person who has offended the authorities,  no  mercy is shown.  Not even special benefit on the new punitive terms will  be granted and certainly not sickness benefit.

The Department of Social Security has been acting on this new legal  opinion from the Attorney-General1s Department for over six months. It was not until last week on 27 October that Senator Chaney told  Parliament he proposed to take the matter to the Government.

He knows and his Department knows that terrible personal tragedies  have resulted from this misapplied zeal of his Department.

When the Attorney-General’s Department indicated that they considered  sickness benefit had been erroneously granted for the past 37 years,  Senator Chaney should have called for amending legislation immediately  so that the spirit of the legislation could be implemented.

If the Government's response to Senator Chaney's proposals - whatever  they may be - is asdawdling as the Minister's response has been so  far - then there is need for an active campaign with strong argument  and case histories.

There is great anger within Social Security offices because they are  forced to implement the new sickness and special benefit policies. There is a sense of outrage within welfare groups that people who do  not choose to fall ill or suffer accidents are being victimised by

some senior departmental officials who neither know nor care about  the misery they are causing.

RESPONSIBILITY FOR MAINTENANCE?

Senator Chaney has reactivated the maintenance provisions of the Social  Services Act which have not been enforced since the mid-1970s. Single  parents will only be paid widow's pension or supporting parent's  benefit if they have pursued maintenance from their separated or  deserting partners to the satisfaction of the Department of Social

Security. .

The Prime Minister agrees with Senator Chaney that taxpayers should not  have, to pick up the tab.

"It is really allowing women to be irresponsible, too, if  they just simply can't be bothered going and looking to find  the man or seeing to it by way of the court that he does  fulfil his responsibility as a father and/or husband and father".

(Sydney Morning Herald 20.3.82).

-4-

Senator Chaney has referred to it as a move:

" to shift at least some of the responsibility back  into private hands". (Senate 22.9.82) .

This policy is quite contrary to the recommendations of the Parliamentary  Joint Select Committee into the Family Law Act (22.8.80) which  advocated that the Social Services Act be amended to delete provisions  requiring pension and benefit applicants to take maintenance proceedings.

It also recommended:- .

"5.72.... that the Government review the arrangements for  the collection and enforcement of maintenance with a view to  establishing a consistent administrative approach. An agency  should be created modelled on the systems developed by the  Department of Community Services in South Australia and

the Collector of Maintenance in Western Australia... it is  considered that this agency should be established in and  administrered by the Department of Social Security in close  .liaison with the Family Court and courts of summary

jurisdiction under the Family Law Act."

The Labor Party agrees that the onus should not be placed on the single  parent and favours a National Maintenance Collection Agency quite  separate from the Department of Social Security.

Senator Chaney said that he had discussed such an agency with the Chairman  of the Family Law Council in June 1981 but made no decision (Senate  6.5.82). Then, without consultation with single parent groups or  welfare agencies, three months later he announced he would reactivate

the lapsed and discredited provisions of the old Social Services Act.

The Opposition has no objection to an agency seeking maintenance from a  parent in a position to pay for the upkeep of a child in the care of  the other parent, but is strongly opposed to putting the responsibility  solely on the supporting parent who is under threat if she does not

satisfy the Department. That parent is often helpless in the  situation, unable to find the deserting partner or at risk from  violence if she does locate him. She is usually below the poverty line,  unable to afford legal fees. If an agreement is made and the  maintenance does not arrive, the lone parent will not immediately be paid  by Social Security and the family is without money and the process

starts again - and again. .  '

The. Government should reconsider the policy in the light of the findings  of Professor Sackville in his Poverty Commission Report, ’Law and  Poverty in Australia 1  (1975).

"The overwhelming probability is that the requirement, at  best, shifts only a tiny proportion of the cost of  supporting fatherless families from the public purse...

It should be noted also that there are other costs involved  in compulsory maintenance action.  Not only must the  Department of Social Security use resources to assess the  claimant's position but added strain is placed on the  overburdened courts, legal aid schemes and enforcement  agencies...

We consider the compulsory maintenance action to be an  extremely clumsy and wasteful method of detecting abuse. We think the forced use of intimidatory adversary procedures

-5-

for all claimants,  including the majority who are perfectly  honest,  is .  inappropriate in the determination of eligibility  for social security.  . . .  Â·  ' Ã¢ÂÂ   '  Â·

We conclude that the disadvantages of compulsory maintenance  action greatly outweigh its advantages and that the  requirement should be removed from the Social Services.Act. This would do much to preserve the dignity of claimants .

and emphasise the philosophy of social security as a right".

Placing the responsibility of maintenance action on single parents is  another instance of wealthy Liberal Ministers combining with comfortable  bureaucrats to enforce policies directed against poor and vulnerable  lone parents whose problems they do not even begin to comprehend. .

GOVERNMENT BLEEDS MIGRANT FAMILIES

Whilst most families will be maginally better off on 1 November  when they receive tax cuts or pension rises, refugee families  in migrant hostels are having their benefit cheques reduced by 25%.

The Minister for Administrative Services, Mr. Newman, and the  Minister for Social Security, Senator Chaney, approved the migrant  hostels' management grabbing the whole of their benefit rises and a  large slice of what they already had.

A migrant family with four children will receive $10.25 a week less than  they had last May - a drop from being able to keep 44% of their social  security payments to only 33% of them. .

The parents are now expected to pay all transport, and telephone costs,  clothing and chemists' bills, and childrens' school needs out of only  $56.25 a week - for six people.

The table below illustrates the extent of the raid on migrants and  refugees' social security benefits. OLD HOSTEL RATES NEW HOSTEL RATES

SELF-EMPLOYED TRADESMEN

Many tradesmen have been thrown out of work in recent weeks as a result of  the present deep recession. Those who hope to make a living as, say, a  sub-contractor, should be aware that Social Security has sent out tougher  new instructions governing eligibility for unemployment benefit.

Previously a relevant instruction read:

"Availability for alternative employment is essential but^is not a  pre-requisite that a person cease advertising, . surrender licences or  sell equipment or tools to be eligible for unemployment benefit".

An instruction issued in October advises that questions to be asked of  unemployed claimants should include:

"How much capital is used in the activities, e.g. what tools of trade  and equipment does the applicant own? Has any of the equipment been  sold? If so, when?^

Along with these ominous questions which appear to contradict the earlier  instructions is the amazing statement regarding backyard employment:

"Casual activity to the extent that it is accidental, unplanned  or undesigned may be acceptable".

- AND PRIMARY PRODUCERS

A new instruction reads:- '  ’

"....a primary producer may be receiving unemployment benefit because  of his inability to work his property due to a drought; if sufficient Â· , Â· rain falls to pursue ploughing, his degree 'of commitment to selfÂ­ employment may then preclude payment of further unemployment benefit".

' Ã¢ÂÂ  ' ' ' ' ' Ã¢ÂÂ  V :

Previously a farmer could be granted unemployment benefit while continuing ,   to do some work on the property provided he was willing to accept full-time Â· .   work.  It has never before depended on the local rainfall figures and an ; assessment of the ploughing potential by a Social Security officer. .
