Greens release preferred terms of reference for immigration system inquiry

The Greens have today released their preferred terms of reference for both houses of  parliament to investigate Australia’s detention network, with an emphasis on ensuring all  children and their families are released from mandatory detention.

“We’ve released these today so the public will know the Greens continue to negotiate with all  parties in good faith to ensure there’s a comprehensive investigation into Australia’s costly  detention network,” Greens’ immigration spokesperson, Sen. Sarah Hanson-Young, said.

“We also want a cost benefit analysis performed comparing the current system with  community detention, because we know Australians would prefer to see their money being  spent in the most cost-effective way.”

The Greens’ preferred terms of reference for a committee of both houses of parliament on  Australia’s Immigration Detention Network to include:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Any reforms needed to the current Immigration Detention Network in Australia;   Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The impact of length of detention and the appropriateness of facilities and services for  asylum seekers;  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The resources, support and training for employees of Commonwealth agencies and/or

their agents or contractors in performing their duties;   Ã¢ÂÂ¢ the health, safety and wellbeing of asylum seekers, including specifically children,  detained within the detention network;   Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Impact of detention on children and families, and viable alternatives;   Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The effectiveness and long-term viability of outsourcing immigration detention centre

contracts to private providers;  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The impact, effectiveness and cost of mandatory detention and any alternatives,  including community release.
