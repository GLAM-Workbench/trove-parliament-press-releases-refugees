MINISTER THANKS OUTGOING RRT PRINCIPAL MEMBER

Â

The Minist er for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip 
Ruddock has paid tribute to Mr Shun Chetty, who has resigned as Principal 
Member of the Refugee Review Tribunal.

Â

“Mr Chetty who has had a distinguished international 
career in the field of refugee and human rights, has decided to return 
to South Africa,” Mr Ruddock said.

Â

“He was appointed to the position of Principal Member 
of the Tribunal in 1995 and has served with a high level of dedication 
in an area of administrative law that has posed many challenges over 
many years.”

Â

Mr Chetty came to Australia after working with the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in a number of posts around 
the world. He was a lawyer in South Africa in the mid to late 70s, representing 
opponents of the apartheid regime.

Â

“I would like to thank Mr Chetty for his efforts 
and for bringing his experience and knowledge to Australia during his 
time as Principal Member,” Mr Ruddock said.

Â

“His resignation has been accepted with reluctance 
and I wish he and his family well on their return to South Africa.”

Â

Mr John Godfrey will act in the position of Principal 
Member until a new appointment is made.

Â

Mr Godfrey has served at a senior level in the Department 
of Foreign Affairs and was Counsellor - Immigration at the Australian 
Permanent Mission in Geneva, working closely with the UNHCR. He is presently 
a full-time Member on the RRT.
