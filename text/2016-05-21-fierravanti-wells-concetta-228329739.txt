MEDIA RELEASE

WORLD HUMANITARIAN SUMMIT

I will travel to Istanbul, Turkey to represent Australia at the World Humanitarian Summit on  22-24 May 2016.

This Summit, the first of its kind, will bring together government leaders, international  organisations, civil society and businesses from around the world to strengthen global  responses to humanitarian challenges.

I will use my visit to take forward Australia’s agenda to secure new, innovative ways to  respond to humanitarian crises and build resilience in vulnerable communities. I will meet with  ministers from across the Indo-Pacific to discuss Australia’s ongoing humanitarian and disaster  preparedness and response work in our region.

I will also meet with the heads of UN humanitarian relief and refugee agencies and the  International Committee of the Red Cross to discuss how we can improve institutional capacity  and generate financing to respond effectively to global humanitarian challenges.

Australia is a leader in providing humanitarian assistance. We are working closely with our  Pacific neighbours to prepare for, and respond to, natural disasters. Our support for Fiji and  Vanuatu following devastating cyclones are just two examples of Australia’s ongoing  commitment to the region.

We are embracing new technologies and innovation in Australia’s humanitarian program. The  recent Pacific Humanitarian Challenge was an important step to achieving this.

Australia also has a strong record of contributing to global humanitarian efforts, including  through our commitment of an additional $220 million over three years to address the critical  humanitarian and resilience needs in Syria and neighbouring countries.
