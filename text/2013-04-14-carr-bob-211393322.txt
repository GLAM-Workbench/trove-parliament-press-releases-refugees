Interview with Foreign Minister, Bob Carr

Australian Agenda program, 14 April 2013



Peter van Onselen:

As I mentioned off the top, our first guest is the foreign minister, Bob Carr. Senator,

thanks for your company.



Bob Carr:

Pleasure to be with you.



Peter van Onselen:

We're going to get on to foreign affairs issues, that's clearly why we've got you here,

but just quickly on some domestic politics. There is an announcement today in relation

to Gonski, yesterday Dr Craig Emerson talked about cuts to higher education. You're a

wily political veteran from way back, whatever you think of the cuts, whatever you think

of Gonski, surely just optically in real politic it's a bizarre thing, isn't it, to cut one tier of

education to fund another?



Australian Agenda 14 April 2013 Bob Carr



Bob Carr:

This little dance in which we participate in these gatherings when I want to talk foreign

policy, you want to generate a headline into tomorrow's 'Australian' about domestic

policy is going to be very tedious for listeners, because I'm not going to get engaged.



Peter van Onselen:

But even just the politicking of it.



Bob Carr:

No, no, no. I'm here to offer commentary on the politics of that or anything else. I'm

here to talk about foreign policy substance, about how we in the last week have set up

Australia for an optimal relationship with China. I think one that meets all the tests that

Paul laid down, but a host of others.



Peter van Onselen:

But, Senator, you know we're going to do that. We're going to spend a lot of time,

more on this program than any other show does, we're going to be able to go into

those details. But I am just curious what you think about the politics. Not the policy

detail, the politics of cutting education to fund education.



Bob Carr:

The Prime Minister and the Education Minister are talking about this, I understand, later

today. I think it is the wiser course for me to allow them to develop it, Peter.

Australian Agenda 14 April 2013 Bob Carr





Paul Kelly:

I think that's very sound, Senator, but there couple of domestic issues we need to clear

up before we get on to foreign policy. So can I ask you, do you think Julia Gillard has a

tin ear?



Bob Carr:

No, I don't. I don't.



Peter van Onselen:

Does Simon Crean have a tin ear for saying she does?



Bob Carr:

I'm not going to comment on what Simon Crean's reported to have said, but I found

when I sit down with the Prime Minister she listens - I think this is the response of

other ministers - that she listens carefully, painstakingly almost, to the evidence put in

front of her.



If there is one thing she is undeniably good at is weighing the evidence put to her at

cabinet meetings or committee meetings allowing everyone to express a view, asking

the right questions and arriving at a sensible course. I have seen her do this

countlessly.



Australian Agenda 14 April 2013 Bob Carr



Paul Kelly:

You were oversees when we had the leadership fiasco a few weeks ago. How would

you have voted in that leadership ballot?



Bob Carr:

I'm not going to canvas that again. I stand by what I said publicly, Paul. I supported

the Prime Minister.



Paul Kelly:

And you would have voted for the Prime Minister in the leadership ballot, would you?



Bob Carr:

Yes, I supported the Prime Minister.



Paul Kelly:

Isn't it a fact that you told senior colleagues from the NSW Right in previous weeks and

months that if there had been a ballot you would have voted for Kevin Rudd?



Bob Carr:

No, Paul, I'm not going to rework this. Here we've got a game we conduct... I'm not

going to reword this.



Australian Agenda 14 April 2013 Bob Carr



Paul Kelly:

I want to ask if you're denying it.



Bob Carr:

I am denying it.



Paul Kelly:

You are denying it.



Bob Carr:

Paul, I'm not going to rework this. Here we have this proleptic performance either at

the start of at the end of one of these otherwise wonderful encounters where your

objective is to get me to say something that becomes a headline.



Paul Kelly:

No.



Bob Carr:

I'm indiscrete enough, a front page headline in tomorrow's 'Australian', and my

objective is to do nothing of the sort. My middle name is 'no headline'. I am Robert ‘No

Headline’ Carr.



Australian Agenda 14 April 2013 Bob Carr



Paul Kelly:

And you will appreciate these are highly pertinent questions.



Bob Carr:

They are obligatory questions designed to fill a newspaper tomorrow.



Peter van Onselen:

Let me ask you about this then. Sam Maiden, the editor of the weekend Sunday News

Limited papers, has often taken to Twitter and said the only minister in the Gillard

Government that seems to be enjoying himself is Bob Carr because he's focused on

foreign policy issues. Would that be fair?



Bob Carr:

I'm certainly enjoying myself, that's the only thing that with the jet lag and the

avalanche of cables keeps me going. Promoting Australia and explaining Australia to the

world is a wonderful opportunity. Stopping over in Singapore coming back from China I

had a very informal meal in a curry restaurant with Foreign Minister Shanmugam of

Singapore. I was able to explain to him the Australians stance, I guess, on a dozen

subjects.



By the way, it's this sort of effortless integration between us and the world of Asia that

represents the reality of the Australia in the Asian century blueprint which is one of the

achievements of the Gillard Government. The habit of consultation between us and our

neighbours I don't think has ever been more marked, has ever run stronger.

Australian Agenda 14 April 2013 Bob Carr





Peter van Onselen:

One of the key things about that engagement with Asia that was in the white paper

related to our role in the university sector within the region, but we're cutting funding

within the university sector to the tune of $2.6 billion in the forward estimates.





Bob Carr:

I will allow my ministerial colleagues to talk about that, I've got to say in China - let's

talk about China and Indonesia. In China we're able to talk about China being our

largest source of migrants. In Indonesia I was able to talk about Australia Awards, the

current version of the old Colombo Scheme, I think being 10 or 20 times bigger than

the old Colombo Scheme. And just about everyone you talk to in Indonesia in the

foreign ministry, in the Parliament, has studied at an Australian university. The foreign

minister did his PhD at ANU, or has children or grandchildren, or both, studying in

Australia.



Only two days ago in talking to our ambassador in Beijing, exploring the wrap-up of the

Prime Minister's visit, she told me that a vice-chancellor of an Australian university in

Beijing - talking to his counterparts the day after the Prime Minister and I left said that

he never received a more positive welcome from his hosts. So it's as if the positive

conclusions reached between us and the Chinese leadership have gone out to all parts

of the Chinese system.





Australian Agenda 14 April 2013 Bob Carr



Paul Kelly:

Let's talk about this. We've had the Prime Minister in China last week. Isn't the reality

that this new arrangement with China, shouldn't this have been negotiated and sorted

out a number of years earlier?



Bob Carr:

I've come to the view with my little over a year's experience in this job that in

diplomacy things happen when it's appropriate for them to happen.



Paul Kelly:

Surely that's a rationalisation of past Australian government failure?



Bob Carr:

I read your proposition and Greg's proposition in your paper yesterday. I checked with

Dennis Richardson, I checked with others in DFAT this morning, they're insistent that

this proposition got on the agenda with the Prime Minister's letter of April and Dennis

Richardson's visit of September last year.



Things happen when both sides feel it's appropriate for them to happen. Now I will

concede this: but it happens under both sides of politics. The China relationship, I

suppose like other relationships, other bi-lateral relationships - sometimes the American

relationship - runs strong and runs less strong. And there have been periods when for

matters out of our control under both Coalition and Labor governments the relationship

has been less positive than it is now.

Australian Agenda 14 April 2013 Bob Carr





But they really are matters out of your control. The Government made a decision on

Huawei, this is before I entered the Government, for reasons associated with the

security and resilience of our national broadband system and that concerned different

levels of the Chinese Government. That was unavoidable and we had to get over that.



Greg Sheridan:

Mr Carr, to follow up on that very thought, could it be that this very constructive week

we've seen between Australia and China is also a signal on a wider front that the

Chinese themselves, having had a very successful charm offensive for the first decade

of this century and then a very bad 2010 and 2011, with this new leadership may

themselves be wanting to present a kinder, gentler, more friendly face in their

diplomacy and we might be the first episode in that?



Bob Carr:

You'd need - that's a possibility, you'd need some months to make that - draw that

conclusion.



Chinese diplomacy when it comes to the South China Sea dispute, territorial disputes

with Vietnam, Philippines and Brunei, is complex and the response of the 10 ASEAN

nations is pretty complex too.



I think we'd need to look at progress towards that much need-needed code of conduct

to govern the behaviour of the parties and look at the management of the

Australian Agenda 14 April 2013 Bob Carr



disagreement even while we await the definitive diplomacy that will resolve these

disagreements.



Greg Sheridan:

Would you say there is some initial evidence for it though? The red carpet given to John

Key, the positive way the Chinese press anticipated John Kerry's visit, and just the tone

that Xi Jinping takes with his interlockers.



Bob Carr:

It could well be the case. What we want here is a China that is cosmopolitan. Australia

has been in different stages of history. An educated China, that is a China that knows

the world intimately rather than a xenophobic or chauvinistic China. There are elements

of nationalism that runs strongly in China, as there are in other countries. You've got a

sort of nativism in Australia from time to time. You've got nationalism that's identifiable

in Japan and elsewhere. You've got it in China.



Peter van Onselen:

What about a democratic China. Sometimes I feel like I'm one of the only people

lamenting the fact that we're embracing China as it embraces capitalism, yet it's shown

no signs, far from it, of embracing democratisation yet it's allowed freely into the

exchange with the democratic world.







Australian Agenda 14 April 2013 Bob Carr



Bob Carr:

It's a matter of whether you see the glass half full or half empty. People with positive

views of China, Henry Kissinger for example, would remind us that more Chinese are

free at this time than any time since 1949. They are more able to express their views,

fewer of them are in detention because of political views. There's been a report that

has been quietly confirmed the Government is going to get rid of these black jails, these

party detention institutions.



When they talk about democracy the leadership might be nodding in the direction of

what we would call rule of law. Probably the most - it is very interesting, the Chinese

leadership might move towards that concept, the rule of law, an independent judicial

system, before they move towards a more contested parliamentary system.



Peter van Onselen:

Can I ask this though, can we sometimes move too fast. And I think back to 2003 when

John Howard invited Hu Jintao to address the democratically elected Australian

Parliament. Do you agree with an authoritarian Chinese leader being invited to address

a democratically elected Australian chamber?



Bob Carr:

Yes, I do. I back John Howard's judgment on that because I believe that you're more

likely to be effective in encouraging the move towards that educated, outward-looking,

engaged cosmopolitan China by working with them, acknowledging them, and giving

them the sort of support that enables them to say in private exchange with you "We've

made progress on human rights, we expect to make more".

Australian Agenda 14 April 2013 Bob Carr





I've seen no evidence that beating a drum produces a change in behaviour.



Peter van Onselen:

Can I follow that up - sorry to interrupt - can I follow that up with this segue: why at

the one hand pander to China, yet on the other hand within 24 hours of Margaret

Thatcher's death talk about being astounded at her unabashed racism?



Bob Carr:

I don't see the linkage. Let me just say this: I don't think there ought to be right wing

group think that bans any criticism of Margaret Thatcher. I'm the first to say that she

forced all of us in politics to think about the role and function of government. She

forced us all to think about privatisation. Does a state have to own the telephone

network or the coal mines? Full marks to her. But in making an assessment of her it's

appropriate to point out that she did reduce the size of government spending as a

percentage of the economy. This is just part of the assessment that you've got to make

on the way through. I thought it was a very interesting revelation of some of her old

fashioned pre-war attitudes that she could say to me "You shouldn't have as much

Asian immigration".



Paul Kelly:

But it's just old fashioned, do you think she was a racist?





Australian Agenda 14 April 2013 Bob Carr



Bob Carr:

I don't throw the word 'racist' around, I think it's too often used to close down debate.

But if someone looks you in the eye and says - and I found it quaint, I would use the

word 'quaint' - and says to you "Yes, I've been there, I remember meeting you, but

you've got to look at how many migrants you've got and you've got to worry about

them taking over like Fiji".



Paul Kelly:

But many people when they heard your anecdote about that, just after the death of

Thatcher, assumed that you were saying that she was in fact a racist. Is that the case?



Bob Carr:

I allowed them to draw that conclusion.



Paul Kelly:

Is that the conclusion that you drew?



Bob Carr:

I'm just telling you...



Paul Kelly:

Is that your conclusion?

Australian Agenda 14 April 2013 Bob Carr





Bob Carr:

With journalistic attention to detail, something that ought to be there in the historic

record. I found it interesting. I found it interesting. And I speak, as I've made clear over

the years, as someone who has pushed the edge of Labor assessment of Thatcher. I

gave a speech in praise of her in 1988 when she came to Sydney - I was Leader of the

Opposition and I gave a speech of welcome - and I applauded her then as I've

applauded her in comments around her death in saying that she forced us to think

about the role and responsibility of the Government. But, listen, you guys can't fall for

the sort of group think you attack the ABC for. You can't say "horror, horror, horror,

he's expressed a criticism of Margaret Thatcher...."



Peter van Onselen:

But was that appropriate as the foreign minister, so soon after her death, to reveal a

private conversation...



Bob Carr:

It was entirely appropriate and if you are a public figure, a world historical figure like

Margaret Thatcher, you operate knowing that when you are alive and when you are

dead people are going to be weighing the available evidence and drawing all sorts of

conclusions. But my views were very generous, and I think coming from the Labor side

of politics for me to say she forced us to think about privatisation and she told the truth

about the Soviet Union but on the way through she took her time at a reception in the

Great Hall at Westminster in 1999 to shake her finger and to warn me about excessive

immigration from Asia to Australia. I think that is interesting and I think it is worth

putting on the record.

Australian Agenda 14 April 2013 Bob Carr





Paul Kelly:

I wonder if we can just go back to China now, seeing we've dealt with Margaret

Thatcher. In your judgment have we suffered at all from the strong support we've given

President Obama's pivot or rebalancing towards Asia? There have been mixed

messages from Beijing about this. What's your view on this? Have we had any

downside on this with China?



Bob Carr:

On my first visit to China when the then foreign minister expressed what he describes

as his concern about 'Cold War alliances' which I took to be a reference to the decision

announced in late 2011 about the rotational deployment of US Marines in the Northern

Territory, I said to him that we understand Chinese foreign policy by reference to the

history of China, you'd understand Australian foreign policy very largely by reference to

our history; our geographic circumstances. A large continent, small population. The way

in our national memory the fall of Singapore lives and the loss of a land army of 20,000

men in February 1942, that was the darkest day in Australian history. We have always

sought an alliance with the world's dominant maritime power - English speaking as it

happens. The British Empire...



Paul Kelly:

Do you think the Chinese accept this? Is there a downside for us, because most

commentators think that there has been a downside for us.





Australian Agenda 14 April 2013 Bob Carr



Bob Carr:

I think it's more complex than that. I think the Chinese were initially concerned at the

way the decisions on the marines had been projected and announced. When the dust

settled they probably appreciated that there are 300,000 US defence force personnel in

the Asia-Pacific and these were 2,500 marines being deployed in northern Australia for

exercises in training some months every year, with a whole lot more closer to China.



I think the proportionality of it settled in their minds and I think China accepts what's

unavoidable about Australia, and the Labor or Coalition Governments will always have a

treaty relationship with the United States. I think the views that Hugh White and others

very challengingly put to us is really an invitation for us to think about a world decades

from now, half a century from now, where that strategic position might have changed



Peter van Onselen:

You are watching Australian Agenda where we are speaking to the Foreign Minister,

Bob Carr.



Greg Sheridan:

Mr Carr, I wonder if we could switch to a more docile topic, North Korea. The world has

been transfixed by its threats and brigandry in the last week or two. Two questions:

what's your view of this intelligence report that they might be able to mount nuclear

weapons on warheads, and more broadly what do you think is the motivation of the

North Korean Government? What are they trying to achieve? Strategic reassurance from

China, concessions from America, internal consolidation?



Australian Agenda 14 April 2013 Bob Carr



Bob Carr:

I think the motivation is state security. They want recognition as a nuclear armed

regime. Having looked at Libya, looking now as Syria, thinking about what Iran might

do they believe that having nuclear arms is the way to secure this monarchical Marxist-Leninist dictatorship. This uniquely unpleasant regime. And that makes it very hard to

deal with them. It makes it very hard to deal with them.



Greg Sheridan:

What you do think might happen next?



Bob Carr:

The consensus seems to be that they are intent on launching a missile. The missile will

have a trajectory over Japan. It will probably not be shot down by the US or the South

Koreans, for good reasons. So it will pass over Japan. Another nuclear explosion at this

stage is probably less likely. There are no signs of war preparation in the north and the

south remains strikingly calm. And one must speak again in admiration of the restraint

of the Republic of Korea.



Greg Sheridan:

I did an interview with Mike Green, the former Asia director of the US National Security

Council, and he reported to me that although the Chinese are very unhappy with the

North Koreans they've pulled back on sanctions. They are less co-operative in the

sanctions committee in the United Nations, they are not really enforcing the sanctions

on the border. And his interpretation was that the North Koreans have achieved

something of a strategic objective with China. How would you rate that analysis?

Australian Agenda 14 April 2013 Bob Carr





Bob Carr:

I'd like to look at more evidence of China's implementation of the sanctions. They

played a very constructive role working with us and others in the drafting of that

security council resolution that specified sanctions. China has got a deep-seated interest

in not seeing nuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula.



Greg Sheridan:

Did they say that to you on your recent visit?



Bob Carr:

Words to that effect, yes, to the Prime Minister. The Chinese, for reasons that are easy

to understand, will want to keep their dealings with the north to themselves. I'm not

sure what they would have said to John Kerry but I think there will be a lot of dealings

between them and the politburo of North Korea that the west won't learn of.



Greg Sheridan:

Perhaps a final question on the Korean issue. The South Koreans have cleaved ever

closer to the United States as a result of this, so have the Japanese, and both the South

Koreans and the Japanese foreswear nuclear weapons of their own in part because of

the American deterrents. Given the success your government had in China this week,

and I think we all acknowledge it was a very successful week, and given the centrality

of the Americans to the Korean and Japanese situations doesn't this really give the lie

Australian Agenda 14 April 2013 Bob Carr



to the proposition that we're seeing the end of American involvement in our region or

that we should wish for a diminution of that involvement in order to placate China?



Bob Carr:

I think that's very much the point. The Chinese have even acknowledged that the

economic growth in East Asia has been possible because of that big American

commitment to security in the region.



And you're seeing this demonstrated in precisely the way you described in North-East

Asia. That Japan and South Korea with an American security guarantee have no need to

go nuclear. That's a big contribution to peace and security and it's happening with that

America involvement. So we've always said, again under both governments, that

America's commitment to Asia is good for us but good for the whole region. And China

understands that. China understands that.



Paul Kelly:

If we just move to Syria. How concerned are you about the influence of al-Qaeda, the

role of al-Qaeda in terms of the Syrian opposition and al-Qaeda affiliates and what can

the Australian Government do about that?



Bob Carr:

We've got to be deeply concerned with that. We'll work with like-mindeds on what the

appropriate legal stance is, what further prescriptions are required.



Australian Agenda 14 April 2013 Bob Carr



Paul Kelly:

You think some are required?



Bob Carr:

Yeah, and we're discussing that with the British, the French and the Americans. It does

highlight the fact that the longer the Assad regime maintains its solidarity with its

Warsaw pact style weaponry and army holds the three major cities there must be a real

concern that the jihadist elements become more prominent in the various militia that

represent the Syrian opposition.



Paul Kelly:

What's your view about the military situation then? What do you think is the...



Bob Carr:

It's a war of attrition. It's a war of attrition. There is a view that the Assad forces must

lose but it's going to take quite some time. One cannot rule out their resort to chemical

weapons given the desperation of their predicament. There is no indication of a fissure

in the Assad coalition.



Peter van Onselen:

When you say they must lose, do you mean the likelihood that they will or that they

should?



Australian Agenda 14 April 2013 Bob Carr



Bob Carr:

That they will. That they will. I think that is the assessment shared by the Europeans

and the Americans but it is going to take time. It's going to be a war of attrition

because there is not that signal that the coalition that backs Assad, the Alawite led

security forces, is about to sheer off from support for the Assad family.



Greg Sheridan:

Mr Carr, one sideline on that issue, there's a front page report in our paper yesterday

and I've heard the same thing myself, that there are up to 200 Australians fighting in

Syria, perhaps 100 of them involved with the al-Qaeda offshoot in Syria. Now

presumably those folks will come back to Australia with weapons training and

explosives training and an infection of that ideology. How big a concern is that for your

government?



Bob Carr:

It is big, we are all aware of it, and I probably can't go further because I can't comment

on matters of security and intelligence. But the relevant agencies are fully appraised of

this.



Paul Kelly:

Can I just ask what is the degree of concern on this particular issue held by yourself

and the Australian Government?





Australian Agenda 14 April 2013 Bob Carr



Bob Carr:

There is a big investment of time and resources going into it. It's clearly a potential

threat to Australia.



Greg Sheridan:

And Syria to some extent has become a magnet for jihadists.



Bob Carr:

Without a doubt. And again this is the product - whenever I have a response from

someone who is vaguely pro-Assad, and you do get some of them, I say to them just

consider if this country hadn't been distorted and deformed by decades of one-man

rule, the old fashioned model of an Arab dictatorship for life, you would have had an

alternation of governments, you would have had the development of a civil society, a

free media, you wouldn't have this disaster today. This is an outpouring of all the built-up frustrations and arguments and conflicts that were kept suppressed by decades of

that Arab dictatorship-for-life model. And it is just a tragedy. Again it makes the point

that the best investment a people can make is in democratic institutions.



Paul Kelly:

In recent weeks you and the immigration minister have been involved in the Bali

process again. There were some modest progress there. But when one looks at the

heavy arrival of asylum seekers by boat into Australian waters do you hold out any

confidence at all that action can be taken to stem this flow?



Australian Agenda 14 April 2013 Bob Carr



Bob Carr:

The good news out of the Bali process is the commitment of all those governments,

about 40 governments, to criminalise people smuggling in a way that for example

Indonesia has and to criminalise other forms of human trafficking. That is encouraging.

You need a regional response. It is a regional problem. You've got millions of displaced

people, refugees from Afghanistan, in Pakistan and Iran for example, who are fuelling

this. You've got the potential of the Rakhine province, the Rohingya people, to despair

of their future, their stateless position.



Paul Kelly:

But this a new status quo? Are these boat arrivals the new status quo?



Bob Carr:

It continues to be a most serious problem.



Greg Sheridan:

As we're talking about Indonesia, you've invested a lot of time in the Indonesia

relationship. Next year we get a new Indonesian president who can't possibly be as pro-Australian as the current president. Are you confident that our relationship will be OK

no matter which of the current candidates becomes president? There is a chance it

could be Prabowo, with his very difficult past as a human rights abusing general, and

with Indonesian society itself we are seeing a lot of intercommunal violence now. Are

you worried about a certain growth of intolerance, at least at the margins, in

Indonesian society?

Australian Agenda 14 April 2013 Bob Carr





Bob Carr:

Yes, I am and that takes - the Indonesians are aware that that takes some of the gloss

off what we may see as a marvellous advertisement for Indonesia. Its multi-ethnicity

and its relative religious tolerance. These are really law enforcement issues. Law

enforcement issues and law and order issues. Some criminal gangs are behind these

attacks rather than religious fanatics in very many cases I'm told.



But when it comes to continuing to drill deep in Indonesia, I think Indonesian society

and politics to strengthen those links with Australia I think our plan is working to the

extent that the relationship will continue to do well after 2014. That's our biggest

embassy in the world. We have the biggest concentration of diplomats in Jakarta, our

biggest aid program, a very high level of military and police cooperation, and again

those university contacts that count so much.



Peter van Onselen:

I just wanted to ask you about some reports during the week in relation to cables that

WikiLeaks have exposed. When you are a younger man in the 70s, observations that

you were giving to the Americans about the state of the Labor Party. There were some

negative assessments that you were giving to a foreign power. I understand that

people talk to foreign powers the world over, I don't want to make too much of this,

but I'm more interested in the fact that you were pretty down in your assessment of

Labor in what you were telling the Americans back then.





Australian Agenda 14 April 2013 Bob Carr



Bob Carr:

Well everyone in the Labor Party in, I think it was 1974, was in despair at the way the

Whitlam Government was drifting without an economic strategy, with the caucus

challenging the Prime Minister, the Prime Minister not able to get his way in cabinet.

And I mean there is nothing - I was a kid in the Labor machine. I said when I was

asked for a comment on those views, I said "I was in my 20s, I could have said

anything". And I'm glad, Peter, you see how normal that situation is. Diplomats in all

the embassies in Canberra are out talking to people like yourselves, people on the

fringes of politics, staffers, all the time to get some sense of what's happening in

politics. It's what we've been doing with Indonesia with a view what might happen in

their 2014 election. I've got to say when I saw those excavated comments of mine they

were pretty banal. In fact I was struck by how mature they were for a 25-year-old Bob

Carr.



Paul Kelly:

If we go back to Indonesia, Tony Abbot has pledged he'll turn the boats around on the

water. Is there any way that this can work as far as you're concerned?



Bob Carr:

That will immediately produce as a crisis in our relationship with Indonesia. Diplomacy

is not build on a gesture like that - it's built on painstaking work, attention to detail and

careful consultation with your neighbours. That's what we've been doing in Indonesia,

Singapore - I mentioned my stopover there and how I used it - and above all recently in

China.



Australian Agenda 14 April 2013 Bob Carr



A flamboyant gesture like saying we're going to have our people put their lives at risk to

take them out of these boats and get them back into Indonesian waters and say "We

no longer think of this as a regional problem it's your problem" just generates a crisis. I

know how - and Greg would know how that would set off popular opinion, media

opinion in Indonesia.



There are some currents in Indonesian public opinion that are a little anti-western and

could easily be ignited and directed against Australia. Tony Abbott has got to think very

carefully about that.



Paul Kelly:

I think this goes back to the question I asked a few minutes ago that you didn't answer,

because Tony Abbott's obviously very concerned about the flow of boats to Australia.

So as far as you're concerned do you think that as a country we just have to get used

to this? That this in fact is the new status quo?



Bob Carr:

No, I don't. We are entitled, I've always argued this, to determine the procedures by

which someone obtains a privilege of coming to Australia as a migrant. And that is part

of a compact with the Australian people. We are saying to the Australian people will you

accept a relatively big migrant program, will you accept a generous humanitarian

intake. The Australian people are saying in effect yes we will but the Government has

got to control this process.



Australian Agenda 14 April 2013 Bob Carr



And that's why we worked hard on the Malaysian Solution, that's why we recruited a

panel of experts to talk about hour we can more effectively implement this policy. Tony

Abbott ought to embrace the Malaysian arrangement and he ought to accept - he ought

to embrace bipartisanship on this. This is someone who expects to win in September, it

will be in his interests to do so.



Peter van Onselen:

Hopefully we can ask him about it, we're coming up to 500 days since he's been on

been on the program. We'll keep the clock counting. Bob Carr, as always you've been

generous with your time. One final question. Are you going to be generous with your

time in the years to come, because you're up for re-election in the Senate, you're

number one on the ticket. That's a six year term if you are elected successfully, as you

no doubt will be at this coming election. Are you in it for the long haul, will you be there

for six years?



Bob Carr:

Yes, as Foreign Minister of Australia I will be here on this program.



Peter van Onselen:

Thanks very much for your company.
