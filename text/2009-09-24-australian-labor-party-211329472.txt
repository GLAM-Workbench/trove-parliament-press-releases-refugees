Sixtieth anniversary of the UN Relief and Works Agency

Today I attended the high-level event at the United Nations General Assembly to mark the  sixtieth anniversary of the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near  East (UNRWA).

Established by resolution of the United Nations in 1949, the Agency provides humanitarian  assistance and health, education and welfare services to Palestinian refugees in the West  Bank, the Gaza Strip, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria. It is now assisting over 4.6 million  refugees.

Successive Australian governments have consistently supported UNRWA’s operations. This  year, Australia’s annual contribution to the UNWRA’s operational budget will increase by 20  per cent to over $5 million.

Australia has also responded generously to UNRWA’s emergency appeals.

Last year, the Australian Government provided $8 million for job creation in the West Bank,  demining and reconstruction activities in Nahr El-Bared refugee camp in northern Lebanon,  and food aid in Gaza.

Since 2007, Australia has provided more than $75 million in development and humanitarian  assistance for the Palestinian people through UNRWA, other UN agencies, Australian and  international non-government organisations and the World Bank.
