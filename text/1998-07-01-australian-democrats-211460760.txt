DEMOCRATS CONDEMN ONE NATION IMMIGRATION POLICY

Â

HOWARD MUST SUPPORT MULTICULTURALISM AS A MATTER 
OF URGENCY

Â

The Australian Democrats have condemn ed One Nation’s policy 
on immigration and multiculturalism, which was released earlier today, 
labelling it as a recipe for economic and social disaster.

Â

“Repeated claims by One Nation that the policy is 
non-discriminatory is a hollow and outrageous lie.”

Â

Key discriminatory aspects of the policy include:

*Â Ongoing denial 
of access to social security payments

*Â Supporting and 
enabling racial vilification and abuse

*Â Discriminating 
against migrants from non-English speaking backgrounds and those from 
poorer  countries

*Â Abolishing 
multiculturalism

Â

“One Nation is still repeating the lie that immigration causes unemployment 
and foreign debt. The policy is discriminatory because it wants to create 
a mythical mono-cultural Australia, denying the ethnic diversity  
that still exists and destroying the huge economic benefits which flow 
from this.”

Â

“Refugees will also no longer be able to settle 
in Australia under One Nation’s plan.”

Â

“This attack on the very fabric of Australian society 
must be completely repudiated by Mr Howard. It is time for him to make 
a clear, unequivocal statement in support of multiculturalism and its 
importance to Australia.

Â

“One Nation’s destructive and dishonest policy 
highlights once again the stark choice Australians face in the Senate 
at the next election. Only the Democrats or One Nation can hold the 
balance of power. The choice is between tolerance or intolerance, reconciliation 
or confrontation, harmony or division.
