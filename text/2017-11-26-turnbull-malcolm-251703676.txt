JOHN ALEXANDER OAM, LIBERAL CANDIDATE FOR BENNELONG:

Prime Minister, welcome to Bennelong and welcome to Eastwood. I think that was a PB as far as selfies,  was that an all time best?

PRIME MINISTER:

It's getting up there, we definitely got into the hundreds I think - it was good, it was very good.

JOHN ALEXANDER:

Normally politicians overstate that, but I reckon there'd be a thousand.

PRIME MINISTER:

Well it was fantastic, it was great and John it's fantastic being here and seeing the enthusiasm with which  you're welcomed here, that your community's welcomed me. And you know this is a community -

Bennelong - which is built on enterprise, isn't it? Hard-working Australian families.

JOHN ALEXANDER:

It really is, and the businesses really appreciate the lowering of taxes which gives them the chance to  employ another person and grow their business. It is about jobs and growth. We have 16,000 businesses  here, we've strong growth figures, and it is not trickling through it is flowing through out here.

PRIME MINISTER:

Well that's right.

So there's 16,000 businesses in Bennelong alone, which are benefiting right now from our small business

tax cuts. Businesses that employ, that have turnovers of up to $50 million a year, collectively employ  half the private sector workforce.

So that's millions of Australians, and they are benefiting from the tax cuts we've provided. They are

overwhelmingly family-owned businesses, overwhelmingly small businesses. And as John says, because  he understands business, Lucy and I understand business, that's our background.

That is not the background I have to say of the Labor Party or their candidate here, Kristina Keneally.  They don't understand what makes the Australian economy kick. They don't understand what you need  to do to develop, to deliver 355,000 more jobs in the last year.

You've got to have investment, you've got to have confidence in the private sector, and that is what we

have delivered.

So what JA is doing in Bennelong is delivering for his community.

More money in the pockets of hardworking Australian families. Business tax cuts, childcare reforms, -  over 6000 families right here in Bennelong are going to have more money in their pocket, more access

to childcare because of our childcare reforms, which the Labour Party voted against, just like they voted

against the small business tax cuts.

There's going to be $165 million more spent on schools in this electorate because of our Gonski 2.0

school funding reforms. Who voted against that? It was the Labor Party.

But JA you'd have to say you can't be surprised that Kristina Keneally wouldn't be supportive of that

after all when she was the New South Wales Premier, she cut $300 million out of New South Wales  schools in one year alone.

Now we're putting $165 million more in to schools in this electorate alone. State schools, public schools,  private schools, independent schools, Catholic schools across the board. All on a transparent needs-based approach. So that's the commitment that we've got.

JA is working here, with me and the whole government to put more money into the pockets of hard-working Australians to reward and incentivise enterprise to keep Australians safe.

What about the CCTV that you have got the funding for in Eastwood here JA? Talk about that?

JOHN ALEXANDER:

Well we had several unpleasant incidents. We had a forum where we engaged with the community and  we found out that there was not enough confidence in the system for people to actually report crime.

So we've given them that confidence, we've installed CCTV and we've improved the lighting to address

crime in Eastwood and I think we're really on top of it.

PRIME MINISTER:

Well that's right - keeping Australia safe is always our priority, whether it is on the streets, whether it's  in the region, around the world, the fight against terrorism, keeping our borders secure is vitally  important.

Now you know, it is an extraordinary thing that Bill Shorten has handpicked Kristina Keneally as his

candidate here in Bennelong. Kristina Keneally wants us to bring all of those asylum seekers from Manus  to Australia. That's what she said, only a few months ago, that is her view.

Now believe me, right now the people smugglers are using Kristina Keneally's articles, her statements on

this as a marketing tool to get people on to their boats, to take them to sea.

They use WhatsApp, they use Twitter, they use Facebook, they use everything. They are very  sophisticated criminals and they will see and are seeing Bill Shorten's choice of Kristina Keneally as Labor  wanting to throw out the welcome mat to the people smugglers.

And the question for Kristina Keneally should be - when the boat start again, if Labor were ever to get  back into government, how many of those asylum seekers is she going to bring to Bennelong? Because  that's what she is talking about, Kristina Keneally is rolling out the welcome mat to the people

smugglers.

We've stopped the boats, we've restored the security of our borders, we are not going to ever  outsource our borders, our sovereignty, to people smugglers. That's what Labor did and that's what they

will do again if Kristina Keneally is ever able to be part of a Shorten Labor government.

JOURNALIST:

Prime Minister, what are your party's chance of retaining the seat here?

PRIME MINISTER:

We have a fantastic candidate, we take nothing for granted, but we have a great member in JA. The  people in Bennelong know John, as you've just seen, they know him, they know he delivers, they know  he's working for them, not like Kristina Keneally, simply seeking to advance her own political career.

JOURNALIST:

Do you feel the this is still a blue ribbon seat or do you think we will see a repeat of 2007?

PRIME MINISTER:

Every election, whether it's a by-election or a national election, cannot be taken for granted.

John is working hard, we're all working hard once again to get the support of the people of Bennelong.

John do you want to add to that?

JOHN ALEXANDER:

Well we're underdogs in 2010, we worked very hard. We started doorknocking in February. The election

was in August, we won by a small margin in 2013. We increased that margin through engaging with the

community, and really learning what were the issues and then finding ways with the community to  address those issues.

And then again just a little over a year ago we increased our margin again.

So Bennelong will never be safe and it should be competed for because the incumbent should have to  perform to continue with the confidence that they might have from the electorate.

JOURNALIST:

Prime Minister, do you think you can make an impact here - your visit can make an impact?

PRIME MINISTER:

It certainly made an impact in the number of selfies taken.

But look seriously, this is a long-term commitment to this community both by John and by my  government. It's wonderful to be here, we're among friends, we are with the community that

understands and supports and embodies the values of enterprise and hard work which our side of  politics stands for, and for which Labor does not.

JOURNALIST:

Prime Minister, doesn't the Queensland election show a further drift away from the major parties in

voting patterns and particularly from the Liberal and National parties?

PRIME MINISTER:

Well the Queensland election, the counting isn't yet finished. At this stage neither side has got a  majority, so I'll leave the analysis until after all the facts are in.

I've spoken to Tim Nicholls today and to Deb Frecklington, his deputy. They ran a good campaign, it was  a tough environment, there's no doubt about that.

But at this stage it will very interested to see if Annastacia Palaszczuk is prepared to stick to her pledge  not to accept the support of any independent or minor party, if she doesn't actually win a majority of  seats in the house in the name of the Labor Party.

JOURNALIST:

Can you be certain that voters weren't making a statement about your party on federal issues like the

dual citizenship crisis?

PRIME MINISTER:

Well it was a state election fought on state issues, there's no question about that.

JOURNALIST:

Prime Minister, do you feel that your presence was a political negative, given that you only visited once  during the entire state election?

PRIME MINISTER:

Look it was overwhelmingly a - and I helped launch the campaign, as you know, and the campaign  launch.

The election was fought overwhelmingly on state issues. One thing that we know from Australian

politics is that Australians are very smart in the way they go about voting. They know the difference  between a state election and a federal election, they know the difference between state issues and  federal issues, and that was a state election fought on state issues by competing state leaders.

JOURNALIST:

Prime Minister, can I ask Premier Jay Weatherill's Royal Commission into Murray Darling water,  shouldn't that've been done by a Commonwealth government so it properly encompassed all of the  stakeholder states, and won back confidence for everyone?

PRIME MINISTER:

There has been five inquiries into the issue of water theft that was reported on a few months ago.

The MDBA - the Murray-Darling Basin Authority's compliant review, an exhaustive inquiry, the results of  which I released yesterday. That sets out what the problems were, consistent with all the other  inquiries. It sets out what actions have got to be taken to ensure water is managed responsibly and in  accordance with the law. We should get on and do that.

Now if Jay Weatherill for purely political reasons wants to spend South Australian's taxpayer's money on  a Royal Commission, he's free to do that. Federal officials will attend and answer questions, we're not

going to stand in his way on that, but he is going overground that has been very well tilled.

We know what went wrong, we know what we do to get it right, and what we should do now is get it  right. But Jay wants to play politics, look he's got a state election coming up, so he wants to pick a fight

with everybody else. He wants to pick a fight with the upstream states, wants to pick a fight with the  Federal Government. It's politics, it's a very expensive way of going about it.

JOURNALIST:

Prime Minister about a minute ago, Antony Green, the ABC election analyst called the Queensland  election for Palaszczuk. What's your reaction to that?

PRIME MINISTER:

Well I'll wait until all the votes are counted. How do all the other media organisations feel? Should they

stop counting the votes now that the ABC has called it for the Labor Party? No, they actually think they  should count the votes. So let's count the votes in Queensland and we'll see what the result is and

Antony Green may be vindicated - but let's wait for the election, the Queensland Electoral Commission  to do their work, and when all the votes are in and all the votes have been counted. Then the analysis  can be done in earnest.

Thank you all very much. It is a great day, JA —great to be here.

JOHN ALEXANDER:

Thank you Malcolm.

JOURNALIST:

Will you be back, was this a one off, or you'll come back?

PRIME MINISTER:

I'll be back.
