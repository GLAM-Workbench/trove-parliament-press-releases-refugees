BORDER PROTECTION COMMAND INTERCEPTS VESSEL

A suspected illegal entry vessel has been intercepted by the Australian Customs and Border  Protection vessel Storm Bay about 31 nautical miles south west of Ashmore Island.

A group of 63 people were found to be on board.

The Minister for Home Affairs, Bob Debus, said the successful interception demonstrated the  effectiveness of Border Protection Command’s surveillance, including aerial, sea and land  patrols.

“The group is now being transferred to Christmas Island where they will be detained and  undergo health, security and other checks to establish their identity and reasons for their  voyage.

“The Australian Government is committed to strong border security arrangements and this  interception shows we are determined to deal effectively and appropriately with people  smugglers.”

Storm Bay was assisted in the transfer of the people on board by the Navy’s HMAS  Wollongong and a Customs and Border Protection vessel Triton.
