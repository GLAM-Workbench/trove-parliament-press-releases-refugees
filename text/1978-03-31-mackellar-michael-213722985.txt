31 March 1978 JOINT IMMIGRATION COMMUNIQUE

The following joint communique was released at a media

briefing in Wellington at 1515 hours (N.Z. time) today (31 March)

at the conclusion of a Ministerial Immigration Conference:

The Australian Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs,

the Hon. Michael MacKellar, and the Minister of Immigration,

the Hon. Frank Gill, conferred today on a range of matters

of common interest. .  v f

Dominating the discussion were present trans-Tasman travel

arrangements.  The Ministers confirmed that present

arrangements would not be disturbed. However the two

Governments would co-operate through their respective

departments in a close, continuing assessment of whether

those arrangements are being abused in any way by suspected

criminals, illegal immigrants, and visitors intending to

overstay. .  ,  . .  .

Ministers recalled that the present arrangements which were

negotiated in the early 1920's have stood the test of time

very well and there would need to be compelling reasons

before any change would be contemplated.

Immigration officers from the two countries would co-operate

in reviews of immigration and travel legislation to encourage

as much similarity as national policies and circumstances

would permit. The feasibility of co-ordinating the input of

immigration information into a computer based link between

the two countries would be studied., .

The Ministers said that to give weight to these investigateons

arrangements would be made for senior officers to be exchanged

to work at senior policy and operational levels.

In the course of their discussions Ministers reviewed the

growing world problem of refugees and exchanged views on

the handling of refugee intakes. Ministers underlined

that the problem basically bad two parts, first of finding

cash and resources to facilitate movement and resettlement and

secondly, in stopping the creation of refugee situations.

All governments throughout the world had an obligation to

act firmly and responsibly in both those areas.

As further evidence of the effort towards co-ordination

the Minister, Mr. MacKellar, would consult his State

colleagues on the possibility of the New Zealand Minister

joining the regular Commonwealth State Conferences on

Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Policies and Problems. ^

Ministers exchanged views on the need to give practical

support to the aspirations of ethnic groups in the recognition

and support of diverse cultural values. The urgent need to

provide English language training to non-English speaking

newcomers was discussed.

Ministers recognised that Immigration control was a

fundamental tool in population planning policies and in the

complementing of the national bank of skills. They agreed to

exchange information on demographic studies and policy planning.

Ministers reveiwed existing and predictable sources of

immigration and particularly noted the large exchange of

New Zealand and Australian residents as settlers in the

other's country.

Ministers reviewed schemes in both countries for the settlement

of immigrants and exchanged views on techniques of English

language instruction and on other ways of acknowledging and

fostering cultural traditions.
