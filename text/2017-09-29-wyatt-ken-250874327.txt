NEW CENTRE OPENS UP MORE OPTIONS IN VIETNAMESE AGED CARE

An innovative $13.4 million residential aged care home will provide tailored, family  friendly options for older Vietnamese Australians needing care.

Officially opening the Mekong Cairnlea Vietnamese Aged Care Facility in Keilor East,  Victoria, Aged Care Minister Ken Wyatt AM said it was an important step forward for  multicultural Australia.

“Along with quality, choice and affordability in aged care, the Turnbull Government is  committed to ensuring older people can enjoy the benefits of culturally sensitive  care,” Minister Wyatt said.

“I congratulate the Indochinese Elderly Refugees Association Victoria for its work  over many years to help older Indochinese Australians. These wonderful people have  participated strongly in our communities, while keeping their culture alive.”

“The Australian Government allocated a grant of $8 million to help build this facility  through the 2012-13 Aged Care Approvals Round. Since then, the Association has  harnessed its incredible drive, with additional fundraising to make this project a  reality.”

Minister Wyatt said further work on culturally appropriate care was underway through  the Aged Care Sector Committee, which is developing an Aged Care Diversity  Framework.

“The Framework, which I expect to receive in December, will help identify the  common barriers which may prevent people accessing care, and how this can be  remedied,” the Minister said.

“The opening of the Mekong Cairnlea facility is a new chapter in the lives of residents  who will stay connected to their heritage and be cared for by people who understand  their background. This is what older people who helped build this nation deserve.”
