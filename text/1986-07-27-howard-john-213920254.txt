TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW, HON JOHN HOWARD MP, LEADER OF THE   OPPOSITION, ON "SUNDAY", CHANNEL NINE, SYDNEY, 27 JULY 1986

Q Mr Howard the big political story over the last few  .  days has been the American move to sell subsidised wheat to China and the Soviet Union - our traditional   markets. You say we shouldn't use Pine Gap and the

other bases as bargaining chips. So what bargaining   chips have we got?

JWH Well you have the bargaining chip of our close  relationship with the United States. You have the ,   bargaining chip of the impact on freer trade around   the world. You have the normal diplomatic efforts.

You have persuasion on other countries affected in   the same way as the United States. But to use the   bases is to fail to realise that the presence of   '  those bases in Australia are just as important to

Australia as they are to the United States. It's an   .  act against.our national interest to compromise those bases. Â·  .  '

Q Many farmers wouldn't agree with you on that. In  fact, many of them are saying that you should use   everything available to you to pressure the   United States at the moment. Why should the bases be

immune from those sorts of discussions?

JWH .  Because the joint facilities , or the bases, .  are part   of the world-wide defensive network of the free ,   world. It is cutting off your nose to spite your   face. Â·

Q But isn't there...?

. . .  JWH No I don't think there is. It's a question of   -  "  selfish national interest. The selfish national  interest.is that we remain an integral part of the   western world and we play our part in securing the

free world. I just think to get the two together -   and let's face it - the more rational elements in the   ‘  Labor Party agree with me. The maddies don't, but

the more rational elements do.

Q "  Couldn't you say there is an element of selfish Â· - national interest in what the Americans are doing?

2 .

JWH Well most countries do behave out of selfish national  interest when it comes to trade. Let's not muck .  . .  .  around. When it comes to trade, everybody looks  after themselves.

Q Well it's not in our national interest if the Russians the Americans are protecting us from are  .  Russian wheat buyers. This must affect the alliance,  mustn'tit? .

JWH It is certainly putting a lot of strain on the close  relationship and I totally share the criticism that  .  has been made of the Americans. I said so yesterday  in Western Australia. The Opposition will join the

Government in any joint approach to the United . .  States.  .  .

Q Should Mr Hawke go to Washington?

JWH If necessary, yes. If there is value in it, yes.

Q Do you think there is? .

JWH There could well be value in it. That is something  that he would have to assess. But I would like to  see a joint parliamentary delegation including people  from the Liberal Party, the Labor Party and the  National Party, go and talk to the people in  Congress. We will cooperate with the Government. We  .  will.join the Government. We will present, as far as

.possible, a bipartisan front because this is  something that affects us all. It is not something  for cheap political point scoring. But for heaven's  "  sake, let us not make the mistake of allowing a row

over trade to distort our judgement about something  .  as basic to our survival and security and the western  world's survival and security as those joint  .  facilities.

0 You are going to suggest that to Mr Hawke? Are you Â·  going to go to him and say 'look why don't we  approach them jointly?'

JWH .  Ralph Hunt has already, on our behalf, telexed the  Prime Minister offering a joint delegations I have  ,  publicly made these comments and if necessary I will  talk to him directly. But I think he would be aware

of my views from the public comments I have made. It  is not something for political point scoring. This  does affect all of us and we'll play a very  constructive role. But for heaven's sake, let's keep  our sense of proportion and keep the bases out of it.

Q Mr Howard, the Prime Minister heads off for London next Friday for a meeting of seven Commonwealth  Prime Ministers about South Africa. There's no  ,  chance of a joint, approach there. But what do you  .. think Mr Hawke should be putting to that meeting?

3 .

JWH I think Mr Hawke should be putting to that meeting  the lunacy of believing that at the end of the day  destroying the South African economy is going to help  the people of that country and is going to produce a  better South Africa than you have, at the present  .  time. I am fairly pessimistic about the future of

South Africa but I think the future will be made a  little worse if the economy of that country, were to  be destroyed. Such people as I have spoken to from  South Africa who have visited this country, and what  I know of the situation, leads me to think that if  you destroy the economy of that country you run the

risk of an even greater blood-bath than might  otherwise arise. I think Mr Hawke ought to temper  some of the stridency of his recent language. I  think he ought to drop some of the double standards

that have been' used against the British Government on  this issue. He ought to come to realise that even if  sanctions were to work,Â·the result of those sanctions  might be unimaginably worse than what we have at the

present time. '

Q Mr Howard you have.aligned yourself very closely with the stand taken by both Mrs Thatcher and  Ronald Reagan against sanctions* :

JWH Against punitive sanctions. I think at the end of the day they will agree on. something fairly symbolic.

Q Well would you explain.that because what is the  "difference between a sanction and a punitive  sanction? Isn't it the. case that any sanctions  brought against South Africa are meant to punish in

one way or another? What sanctions could you bring  against a government like that which doesn't appear  to be interested in talking that wouldn't be  punitive? V

JWH Well I think if you knock off South African Airways   flights; that's uncomfortable, but it's not punitive .  in the sense that if people want to go to .

South Africa they fly to Harare in Zimbabwe and then   Zimbabwe will continue to allow flights in and out of   South Africa and you go there that way. It's those   sorts of sanctions which I think at the end of the   day the western world will probably end up adopting.

Q Will you support Australia doing that?

JWH. If Australia were to end up doing that the view I .  would take is that it won't achieve anything. I   believe that. I think there is more hypocrisy and   nonsense talked about this sanctions issue and there

have been more double standards on. this whole issue   relating to South Africa than just about any issue in   recent times. To have the spectacle of countries   that have no regard at all for parliamentary

4 .

democracy lecturing the British about liberalism and  democracy and freedom when they've had states of  emergencies for over ten years in their own countries  is really a bit rich. .  .  .

Q But do you really believe that the Botha Government are going to listen to talk? I mean there is every  indication that they're battening down the hatches.  They are prepared to fight, this thing out. .They're .

not going to listen to anybody. .

JWH And that is the very reason why imposing nominal economic sanctions is not going to work. At the end  of the day the only hope you will have of toppling  the Botha Government is to look at the imposition of  comprehensive mandatory sanctions involving every  country in the world. That.has not worked in the

last fifty or sixty years. It didn't work in the  1930s and it didn't work in the 1960s. If it were to  work then you would destroy, the South African  economy. If you think that's going to help the black  people of South Africa; if you think that's going to  produce a new order in South Africa, then you have a

totally different view from mine,

Q Do you think the Botha Government should bex  toppled and if so how should it be done?

JWH I would like, to see the Botha Government replaced by  a Government that brought together the liberal  elements of the white community and the more moderate  elements.of the black community because the only way  -  you have a hope in South Africa is for an

understanding between the more rational elements on  both sides. "It is unreal to talk about an immediate  transition overnight.

Q How can it come about?

JWH How can that come about? Well it can only come about  through the process of internal change within  South Africa. One of the dangers of the outside  world going too far is that you force the white

community in upon itself even more. Anybody who’s  read South African" history understands what is called  the laager mentality, particularly of the Afrikaners  in that country. A lot of:-people forget that the  present South African Government has a very strong  .  defence force, have very strong security forces, and

its capacity to withstand both internal revolution  and outside attack from countries in Africa is very .  great indeed. I think.there is a lot of nonsense and unrealism talked about the situation and I think you

run the danger of strengthening the laager mentality  rather than weakening it by the.sort of attitude that  is being taken at" the moment.

Malcolm Fraser,  of course,  says that the history of  the Boers shows that they're not going to respond to  persuasion - only to force.

Well I think the history of the Boers also shows *  their determination to fight, whether you like it or  not. I don't find them attractive at all. I find  the South African Government very illiberal and very  unattractive.  . .  .

So why should we expect that they'll listen to  reason?

Yes but there are a lot of other governments that are  unattractive. I don't like the fact that the  Soviets, as we talk,  are napalm bombing villages in  Afghanistan and there are five million Afghan .

refugees in Pakistan. But the world seems to have  forgotten that. The same athletes that have  boycotted Edinburgh - many of them had only just come  back from some Games in Moscow. Now I am not saying  they shouldn't have gone. I am just saying that .  there is a double standard.

Mr Howard you've got a meeting of the Federal Council  of the Liberal Party over the next three days. We're  told that will show us the shape of the kind of  Liberal Party you want* Are you deliberately moving  the Liberal Party to the right? Â·  -

I don't think it's a question of moving it to the  right.  It is though very- much a question of making  it plain where we stand. I think people want from us  two things at the moment.  They want hope and they  want choice. They want the Liberal Party to give

them some hope that there is a way out of the present  economic despondency - and we can. We are the only  Party that can because we are the only Party that's  got the flexibility and the freedom to offer the sort  of change that Australia needs to bring us out of our  malaise. They also want choice. They want to know

exactly where we stand.  What I have been doing, and  what some may have interpreted as a move to the  right,  is to make it clear where we stand on certain  issues. Now I make no apology for that. Some of the

stances I take on certain issues might be regarded as  conservative. I don't care.  It's a question of  letting people know exactly where we stand on issues  and I think the sort of things I am talking about is  the right mix.

Is it the case that moving to the right is the only  thing you can do politically because the Hawke.Labor  Government is hardly identifiable these days as a  Labor Government? -

ÃÂ´ Ã¢ÂÂ¦

JWH I think that's an over-simplification. If. you look at its. associations with the trade union movement and   you look at the extent to which the union movement  continues to dominate its decisions ,  I think it is

still very much a traditional Labor Government.

Q How does the union movement dominate their decisions?

JWH Well the whole maintenance of the Prices and Incomes   Accord - despite its failure and despite the fact  ,  that it has given us a hugely uncompetitive economy  and an enormously high inflation rate and an

historically weak dollar. Despite all of those  things the Government continues to parrot this .   nonsense that the Prices and Incomes Accord has  delivered an economic nirvana. That's the perfect

illustration of the way in which they are in a reflex  fashion still owned by the trade union movement.

Q Would you see Mrs Thatcher as a role model?

JWH No I don't, see anybody as a role model.

0 The things you say are very similar to the things she  says.  . .  .  .  :

JWH Well yes,  but Australia is different from Britain and   whilst if you.ask me to look at overseas leaders I do   have a great deal of respect for both her and for  President Reagan, Australia is different.

Q .  The reason I ask that though is that Britain, while ;  having these deregulation policies that you are  proposing has massive unemployment, the highest wage .   rises in Europe. I mean is that a good idea?

JWH There are differences between what I'm arguing for Ã¢ÂÂ   -.  and what she is arguing for and there is a difference   between the British economy that she inherited and  the Australian economic, experience. Although the way

we are going, there may not be very much difference  at all in a very short period of time. I think the  .  problems she inherited were enormous.  But I don't see anybody as a role model. I think the.challenge

for an Australian political leader is unique because  there are characteristics about our society that are   distinctive and long may they remain distinctive.

Q -  Mr Howard just about every time someone interviews ..   you there has been some sort of poll or survey to   suggest that a Liberal/National Party Coalition could .   never win Government against Bob Hawke while you are

leader and you shrug it off each time. .

JWH. That's right, and I'll continue to do so because it's 1   nonsense. .  ,

Do you think that your Party can continue to shrug  off those sorts of suggestions?

Well they not only can - they will - because the  assumption underlying the question is wrong. I have  no doubt that the political tide is moving our way.  Polls go all over the place. .  In fact they have been  very equivocal on.both sides over the last few weeks.

They haven't been very equivocal about the fact that  Andrew Peacock has got a much higher approval rating  than yourself.

That doesn't trouble me at all..

...difference between personal obstinacy and your  political realism, surely?

It's not personal obstinacy. It's a question of  knowing what's going to happen at the end of the day.  That's got nothing to. do with personal obstinacy.  What will happen at the end of the day is that we  will win and we will win under my leadership. I have

no doubt that I am thie. best qualified person to lead  the Liberal Party. .

Mr Howard a final question: why is it that your Â· Shadow Ministry is so shadowy? Why is it that other-  groups - the union movement, the Labor left , the  Farmers' Federation - can get publicity criticising .

the Government, but your team can't? What are they  doing wrong? -

I think that's an unfair criticism of them. Most  Oppositions suffer from that criticism - that the  only person you hear from is the Leader. In  March 1983 the only two figures in the Labor Party

anybody knew outside the cognoscenti, so to speak,  were Bob Hawke and Bill Hayden.

In your case it's you and Andrew Peacock, isn't it?

And Ian Sinclair, yes. Well Andrew Peacock is a  former Leader. It's not surprising. Of course he is  well known. It would be very surprising if he  weren't. But I think that's a problem that all  Oppositions have and it's only when people like

Keating and Willis and Button became Ministers they  became household words. I think you'll find that  after we win at the next election people like Jim  Carlton and Neil Brown and so forth will become the

household words that Keating and Button are.
