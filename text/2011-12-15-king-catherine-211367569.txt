THE HON CATHERINE KING MP   PARLIAMENTARY SECRETARY FOR HEALTH AND AGEING

COMMUNITY AWARENESS GRANTS AWARDED TO SUPPORT DONATELIFE WEEK 2012    The Parliamentary Secretary for Health and Ageing, Catherine King today announced  Community Awareness Grants to the value of $527,032 to support DonateLife Week 2012  events that will encourage more Australians to ask and know family members’ donation wishes.

Funded through the Australian Organ and Tissue Authority, grants have been awarded to 20  organisations to conduct a range of community events during DonateLife Week 2012 that target  both the general public and young adults (18-29 years).

Young adults are less likely to have decided about becoming an organ and tissue donor and  less likely to know the donation wishes of family members.

DonateLife Week will be held from Sunday 19 - Sunday 26 February 2012 and consists of  community events across Australia to promote organ and tissue donation.

The theme of DonateLife Week 2012 is, “Ask and know your loved ones’ wishes, especially this  week because it’s DonateLife Week” to address the prevailing gap between people who believe  their family knows their donation wishes (72%) and people who know the wishes of family  members (57%).

“The DonateLife Week community events will provide new opportunities to engage those  Australians who may not yet have decided about organ and tissue donation or discussed it with  family members,” Ms King said.

"The community awareness grants will assist people to get the facts about organ and tissue  donation to support them in making an informed decision and sharing their decision with their  family members”.

The full list of the 20 successful Community Awareness Grant recipients is at  www.donatelife.gov.au.

The Community Awareness Grants are administered by the Organ and Tissue Authority as part  of its Community Awareness and Education program.

DonateLife Week is led by the Organ and Tissue Authority as part of the Australian  Government’s National Reform Agenda to increase organ and tissue donation.    THURSDAY 15 DECEMBER 2011
