RN Breakfast with Fran Kelly  ABC Studios, Parliament House  31 May 2017  7:50am AEST

E & OE



JOURNALIST:

Some of the major players in the Australian media will launch an all out bid  today to convince the Senate to pass the Government’s long awaited media  reform package. It’s an unprecedented show of industry unity really, more  than 25 top CEOs from all the major newspaper groups, commercial television  and radio networks joining forces to campaign for the biggest changes to our  media laws in more than two decades.

But they are facing stiff opposition. The abolition of the two out of three rule,  which prevents media companies dominating a single market is opposed by  many in the Senate.

The Communications Minister Mitch Fifield joins us, Minister good morning.

FIFIELD:

Good Morning Fran.

JOURNALIST:

Before I get to your media reforms, I think you were just listening to the  Director General of the ASIO, Duncan Lewis. Are you satisfied with his  explanation, does it make sense to you, his comments when he said there  was no connection between refugees and terrorism? It’s a claim he still  makes, it’s not being a refugee that makes someone a terrorist, it’s being  radicalised by Sunni extremists.

FIFIELD:

Subject: Terrorism, Media Reform, ABC funding



Well, terrorists come from a range of backgrounds. There are a range of  causes of terror activity. Chief amongst them is the radicalisation of youth. I  think the Director General put things in good context.

JOURNALIST:

Let’s go to your portfolio now, you’re bringing together the major commercial  and subscription networks, News Corp, Fairfax, Macquarie radio group,  they’re all in Canberra today to lobby Labor and the crossbenchers. I think this  is what you call rolling out the big guns. Does it suggest you need  reinforcements to try and get your package through the Senate?

FIFIELD:

This isn’t just the big guns, I mean you’re right, we have Nine, Seven, Ten,  Fairfax and News Limited who will be represented this evening but we also  have a large number of small commercial radio operators. The Australian  media has players of all sizes. But the really significant thing here is that  they’ve all come together. They’re all speaking with one voice. Saying that  they believe that our media reform package needs to be passed and it needs  to be passed in its entirety.

JOURNALIST:

Why in its entirety? I mean most of this package is non-controversial. It’s  really the two out of three rule that the Greens, One Nation, Labor are  opposed to. Why not split it? And get the rest through?

FIFIELD:

It’s a good package. It deserves to be supported as a whole.

JOURNALIST:

Yes, but what happened to, what’s the phrase, perfection being the enemy of  the good or whatever the phrase is.

FIFIELD:

(Laughs) The thing about this package is no one in the media industry gets  everything they want, but everyone gets a part of what they want. It’s  important that the whole industry benefits. We don’t want to have a situation  where my colleagues feel that they can cherry pick. Because if you start  cherry picking, then you’re not going to have the full sector benefits. And I’ve  got to commend that the leaders of the Australian media industry who have

looked beyond their own legitimate organisational interests, to the broader  health and wellbeing of the sector.

JOURNALIST:

But why is it in the interest of any particular market, any particular regional  centre or state or capital city that all the news outlets, the major news outlets  of radio, television, newspapers are controlled by one media group?

FIFIELD:

No one is suggesting that all media outlets in a particular market be controlled  by one media group, it’s important…

JOURNALIST:

But they could be couldn’t they?

FIFIELD:

No, not at all. It’s important to recognise that while we’re talking about the  abolition of the 75% audience reach rule and the two out of three rule, we will  still have the retention of the two to a market radio rule, the one to a market  TV rule, what’s known as the five/four or voices rule which says that you’ve  got to have in a metropolitan area, five independent voices and in a regional  area four independent voices. Also on top of that, you’ll have the ACCC’s  competition ruler being run over things. And let’s not forget that we still have  the ABC and the SBS. So what we want to have is strong Australian media  voices. This package is unabashedly pro-Australian media. And what  Australian media is telling us is that they want the opportunity to configure in  different ways. They want greater freedom, so that they can get scale, so that  they can be competitive, so that they can be viable for the long haul. That’s  what this is all about, is ensuring good, strong, viable, long term Australian  media organisations.

JOURNALIST:

And scale is all about really, facing the onslaught from social media giants  Facebook and Google isn’t it, who are hoovering up the advertising revenue,  more than 80% of ad growth is going to new media.

Senator Xenophon has proposed a super tax on these tech giants. Would you  consider such a tax in exchange for his vote?

FIFIELD:

You’re right, the online providers, the over the top providers, are competing  for ad revenue. This is something that wasn’t envisaged at the time that our  media laws were drafted in the late 80’s when Kylie Minogue was still singing  The Locomotion. So it’s a different environment. Our media laws need to  change.

I’m aware of Senator Xenophon’s proposition. And you will hear from a range  of different people that there should be things done on copyright. That there  should be things done in terms of taxation. That maybe there should be  content requirements for some of the over top providers. They’re all things  which are put to government. But we have on the table today, a concrete  proposition, a comprehensive plan that can assist Australian media  organisations today. And I would urge my Senate colleagues to support this.  This is about strong Australian media organisations. And it’s not…

JOURNALIST:

Are you saying that you won’t spilt the bill and you won’t look at something as  a trade, like a supertax? Let me get that clear.

FIFIELD:

Look, I’m always happy to look at propositions from colleagues. Colleagues  will put them forward. We’re always happy to sit down and talk. But what I’m  not prepared to do is to see this package carved up. It’s a comprehensive  package. It’s a whole. It should be considered as a whole.

JOURNALIST:

You’re listening to RN breakfast, our guest is the Communications Minister  Mitch Fifield. Minister on another issue, One Nation has turned its sights on  the ABC. It says the ABC is out to destroy One Nation and the Whip Brian  Burston has announced that One Nation will oppose all Government bills  unless the Government slashes ABC funding by $600 million over four years.  What’s your response to that threat from One Nation?

FIFIELD:

The ABC’s funding was laid out at the Budget before last. It’s done, as you  know, on a triennium basis and that provides certainty for the organisation. So  the Budget situation for the ABC has been established.

Colleagues, crossbench colleagues, will often put propositions on the table  that they want to talk about. And it’s open to crossbench colleagues to raise

any issue that they want. But we put our legislation forward to the Parliament  to be considered on its merits.

JOURNALIST:

So the Government won’t be blackmailed over ABC funding?

FIFIELD:

The funding for the ABC was laid out the Budget before last. We have a range  of legislative measures before the Parliament. And we put them forward and  ask our colleagues to consider those on their merits.

JOURNALIST:

Senator Fifield, thank you very much for joining us.

FIFIELD:

Good to be with you Fran.
