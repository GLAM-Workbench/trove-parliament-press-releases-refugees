Sky News AM Agenda - Panel discussion  with Kieran Gilbert   Transcript, E&OE

Subjects: Carbon pricing legislation, Migration Act amendments, leadership speculation.

10 October 2011

KIERAN GILBERT: Good morning and welcome to the program. Parliament returns this  week, and it's a crucial week for the Gillard Government, minority government, and big tests  when the carbon tax vote on Wednesday looks like it's got the numbers for that. But the  Migration Act, well, that is a different story altogether, with one MP, the crossbench MP  Tony Crook, remains undecided.

With me this morning I've got Liberal frontbencher, Mitch Fifield. Good morning, Senator.

MITCH FIFIELD: Morning, Kieran.

KIERAN GILBERT: And in Melbourne we've got Labor frontbencher, Richard Marles.  Richard, good to see you.

RICHARD MARLES: Good to see you, Kieran.

KIERAN GILBERT: And Richard, with the carbon tax vote on Wednesday, it looks like  that should be a milestone the Government should be happy with, but there's so many other  distractions detracting from that at the moment, it doesn't seem to be getting the mileage it  should be.

RICHARD MARLES: Well, I think the country is pretty focused on what's going on with  the carbon price. And you're right in saying that the vote that will come up this week is an  important first step in the passage of what is a really important piece of legislation for the  country.

This is going to secure the jobs of the future; this will mean that we have an economy that  can continue to grow without seeing a corresponding growth in emissions. And so this, when  it's all said and done, is a piece of micro economic reform. It is about jobs of the future, and  that's pretty consistent with a government which has created 140,000 jobs over the past year,  750,000 jobs since coming to office. This will secure the jobs of the future.

KIERAN GILBERT: But Richard, the bottom line is, even though it's obviously a very  unpopular piece of legislation and it's been the subject of, as I've mentioned, intense debate  both inside and outside of the Parliament, but it doesn't seem the Government can take a

trick.

There are those other issues, like the Migration Act changes which remain very much in the  air, and of course the ongoing talk about Kevin Rudd, which we'll get to later. It just seems  that, even when the Government does have a win, it's not really the sort of win, the sort of  magnitude that you would hope from a big piece of legislation like that.

RICHARD MARLES: Well, we're dealing with some very difficult issues facing the  country at the moment. And you mentioned asylum seekers and no doubt we'll talk more  about that, but it's obviously a very complicated problem which is a challenge for the country.  But so too is putting a price on carbon.

And I think that in due course, when people assess the way in which we have dealt with the  very difficult jobs of government, we will be marked appropriately for that.

And, the fact of the matter is, we are facing up to this. We are meeting the challenges that are  coming to the country, we are understanding where the rest of the world's going, and we're  dealing with it.

You know, that stands in stark contrast to what the Opposition are doing.

Tony Abbott would have no sense that there is any change to the climate going on, nor would  he see the way in which the world is responding to it. And so, as a result, he's plunging his  head straight in the sand. As a result of that, he's threatening the jobs of the future, and you

can't do that without threatening the jobs of the present.

We're dealing with the issues. He's running away from them.

KIERAN GILBERT: The carbon tax vote, Senator Fifield, we know that it's unpopular in  the electorate, obviously your side vehemently opposed to it. But this is a big milestone for a  minority government. They've been able to pass all of their bills thus far, and this is the  biggest one yet on Wednesday. They've got the numbers; that looks like it's going to pass the

lower house.

You've got to concede that that at least is a legislative — a big legislative victory for this  minority government.

MITCH FIFIELD: Well, it's a funny sort of milestone that imposes additional costs on  business, that further exacerbates cost of living pressures on Australian families and which  will see jobs destroyed. That's a very strange milestone.

But I do agree with one thing that Richard said. He said that if the carbon tax is put in place  that the Government will be marked appropriately for it. And I think they will be marked  appropriately for it; they'll get a big F at the next election.

Richard also said that the Coalition is putting its head in the sand in relation to a carbon tax.  Well, if we're doing that, then we're in good company because an overwhelming majority of  the Australian public think that this tax is a bad idea. Even if it does pass the House of Reps  this week, it's still not too late; it still has to pass the Australian Senate. And would still be  hopeful that the wiser heads in the Australian Labor Party would recognise that they're going  down a path that they should not.

KIERAN GILBERT: But that's not going to happen, obviously. The bill looks like it is all  set to pass both houses with the Greens support in the upper house.

Once this is passed, Senator Fifield, do you concede that a lot of the heat out of this debate  will be removed as well, once it passes both houses, into the new year, and I suppose there'll  be a bit of a return mid-year when it comes into force.

But the sort of campaign that you've run to this point may not have the same cut-through as  it's had quite successfully to this point with the campaign against the carbon tax.

MITCH FIFIELD: Well, that's certainly what the Australian Labor Party would be hoping,  is that people would forget that a carbon tax is impending, that it will be coming into effect in  the middle of next year.

Part of our job is to make sure that this issue remains before the Australian public. I don't  think we'll have to work terribly hard to make sure that that's the case because Australians are  very sensitive about effects on their household budgets. The carbon tax wouldn't be that far  away.

And we'll also have groups such as the new manufacturing alliance who have declared today  that they have formed, that they will be seeking to, at the very least, see this legislation  deferred because it's going to be bad for jobs. Now, we…

KIERAN GILBERT: But that's no surprise. We know that vested interests have always —  various vested interests have been opposed to taxes on all sides. That really can't be seen as  any significant contribution or change in the debate, can it?

MITCH FIFIELD: Well, I don't think wanting the industry that you work in to flourish is a  vested interest. I don't think wanting to make sure that the people who currently work in that  industry continue to have jobs should be characterised as a vested interest.

We hear the Government talk about the changing global economic environment, that there are  challenges on the horizon. If that's the case, then this is absolutely the wrong time to  introduce a new tax. Australians don't want it, business doesn't want it, the Government  should forget it.

KIERAN GILBERT: But that is true, that big business as well, Richard Marles, is making  that point, particularly with the ongoing uncertainty in the euro zone. Treasurer Swan's

heading to Europe this week; he'll see firsthand just how precarious things are in that part of  the world.

Why not at least defer the introduction? Obviously the Government has no intention of doing  that. But things do remain very much uncertain globally at the moment.

RICHARD MARLES: Well, I don't accept that's what big business wants. I think what big  business wants is certainty and I think big business absolutely knows that putting a price on  carbon is a phenomenon that's going on across the world, and they want to know how this  country and Australia is going to do it.

And that's the question we're answering…

KIERAN GILBERT: But a number of the key business groups, Richard Marles…

RICHARD MARLES: …by putting this legislation through.

KIERAN GILBERT: …a number of the key, the peak bodies, are saying they want it  deferred, the AIG and others saying that very thing. So the business representatives are  arguing that case.

RICHARD MARLES: People want to see certainty and they want to know the way in which  this country is going to put a price on carbon.

And look, a lot is overstated in terms of the campaign that's being run by the Opposition. It is  a mother of all scare campaigns. At the end of the day, we're talking about an increase in  costs for the average family household slightly under $10 a week, and for two-thirds of  Australian households, that'll be fully compensated or more than fully compensated by the  package that's being put in place.

Nine out of 10 people will get some benefits from the package that is being put in place to  help deal with any increase in costs. This is a small thing, certainly small compared to the  GST, for example.

And what we need to be doing right now is de-coupling the growth of our economy from a  growth in emissions, and that's actually going to put us in the most globally competitive  position that we can be looking forward to the future, and that's how we secure jobs.

I actually think what Australians want from their government is a government that  understands the issues that are facing the country and is in there batting for jobs, and that is  what we are doing.

KIERAN GILBERT: What you've got, though, coming up on Thursday is we're expecting a  vote, possibly as early as Thursday, on the changes to the Migration Act, those changes  designed to circumvent the High Court ruling of late August, which of course scuttled the  Malaysia deal.

This vote potentially could break the record which has stood since — I mean, 1929, Stanley  Bruce's Government — that a government hasn't lost a vote on one of its own bills or an

amendment to one of its own bills. That would be an inauspicious record to break, wouldn't  it, and it would detract from what you see is a carbon tax win on Wednesday.

RICHARD MARLES: Well, if we're talking about putting legislation through the  Parliament, we are of course a minority government. But despite that, we have passed more  legislation over the last months than the Howard Government did in its corresponding first 12  months in office. So there is no question that the Parliament is functioning and the  Government is working.

But when it comes to the amendments to the Migration Act, what we will see this week, if  Tony Abbott holds to what he is currently saying, is an act of rank hypocrisy on his part. This  is a man who had stood for offshore processing for a decade, and he will be voting against the  only door open to processing asylum seekers offshore that exists, in light of what the High  Court has determined. He'll be doing that…

KIERAN GILBERT: Okay. I'll ask…

RICHARD MARLES: …knowing all the dangers associated with getting on those leaky  boats.

KIERAN GILBERT: …I'll ask Senator Fifield — I'll put that claim of, or that accusation of  hypocrisy to Senator Fifield in a moment.

But while we're talking about hypocrisy, why don't we talk about what John Faulkner has  said about the Labor position and what others in your party would quietly be hoping, and that  is that this bill is voted down, is blocked, because they don't support offshore processing. In  fact, John Faulkner told the Caucus last week, or a couple of weeks ago, that it's contrary to

the Labor platform, offshore processing.

So if you're going to talk about hypocrisy, what about those claims from your own side?

RICHARD MARLES: Well, I don't accept the proposition that it's against the ALP's  platform in that the ALP's platform has many components to it including cooperation with  our nearest neighbours by having a regional approach to the issue of asylum seekers and by  putting in place all measures appropriate to prevent people coming to this country on boats.

Now, that is what we were putting in place through the Malaysian arrangement, and this is an  arrangement…

KIERAN GILBERT: But Labor has said…

RICHARD MARLES: …which really has the opportunity of stopping boats from coming.

KIERAN GILBERT: …Labor said repeatedly, Richard — Richard Marles, Labor said  repeatedly so often in opposition, accused the Pacific Solution of lacking integrity because  they were — it sent asylum seekers to non-signatory countries, non-signatory countries to the  UN Refugee Convention. And now you want to do the same thing here with Malaysia.

So you're accusing Tony Abbott of hypocrisy, but surely Labor needs to recognise that it's  being hypocritical itself on that front.

RICHARD MARLES: Well no, I don't accept that, Kieran. The Malaysian arrangement had  within it important safeguards for those people who were going to Malaysia. The Malaysian  arrangement was worked out in cooperation with the UNHCR. Neither of those points  applied to the Pacific Solution as it was negotiated by the Howard Government.

The Malaysian arrangement would see an extra 4000 asylum seekers come to this country  under the ordered program, which again is done through the UNHCR. There was no such  balance associated with the Pacific Solution that was put in place by the Howard  Government.

And the Malaysian arrangement is consistent with what we've been doing from day one,  which is to process people as soon as they come here, which is not what we saw with the  Pacific Solution where people were sent to Nauru and allowed to languish on Nauru in some  cases of up to five years. They are very different ways in which we go about this problem.

But what the Malaysian arrangement would do is break the model of people smuggling,  which would stop people going on those very dangerous journeys from Indonesia to  Australia, and would put the UNHCR back in charge in terms of being our principal agent as  to who this country's asylum is extended to rather than people smugglers in Indonesia.

Now, what we're going to see from Tony Abbott if he votes against this is that knowing all of  that, he will be closing the one door which is open to offshore processing.

KIERAN GILBERT: Okay, let's put this to Senator Fifield then. Given the Coalition has  been such a fierce advocate of offshore processing for so long, and also under the Howard  Government Nauru was not a signatory to the UN Refugee Convention and now it's the

benchmark that the Coalition is setting, isn't that hypocritical, as we've been — as Richard  Marles has been pointing out, that in government you have one standard but now it seems for  political purposes you've changed that standard?

MITCH FIFIELD: Not at all, Kieran. But since we're talking about hypocrisy, I have to  mention exhibit A for hypocrisy, and that is obviously there will be no carbon tax under a  government I lead. Hypocrisy exhibit B for the Australian Labor Party is they're embarking  upon offshore processing.

When the Australian Labor Party were in opposition, they said every single day of the week  that offshore processing was immoral, that offshore processing was not effective.

KIERAN GILBERT: We covered that. We did cover that…

MITCH FIFIELD: We covered that…

KIERAN GILBERT: …and we did put — I did put that to Richard Marles. But on your  specific claim, the claim against the Coalition, you supported sending asylum seekers to  countries, non-signatory countries to the Refugee Convention, in government. Now when  there's a vote in Parliament this week, it seems Mr Abbott's changed that standard. Why?

MITCH FIFIELD: Well, the Nauru solution, under the Coalition, we're effectively  controlling the facts on the ground. We were running that particular facility. The Australian

Labor Party are proposing an entirely different scenario in Malaysia where the Australian  Government will not have effective control on the ground.

We think that the appropriate way to make sure that there is decent, adequate standards on the  ground now is for any offshore processing site to be a signatory to the UN Convention for  Refugees. Malaysia…

KIERAN GILBERT: So it's a road to Damascus almost, that you've been convinced by  Labor's arguments here?

MITCH FIFIELD: No, we embark — we look at practical solutions. Nauru — we  controlled the facts on the ground. It was a decent solution. Malaysia is not a decent solution.

Now, it's the Australian Labor Party who have had the conversion on the road to Damascus.  They now think offshore processing is okay. Apparently, offshore processing is only immoral  and ineffective when it's done by the Coalition. Apparently, it's effective and moral when the

Australian Labor Party is doing it.

KIERAN GILBERT: But he did say…

MITCH FIFIELD: The Labor Party could have offshore…

KIERAN GILBERT: …Richard Marles did point out that UNHCR has ticked this off, that  they've approved it.

MITCH FIFIELD: Well no, they haven't, no, they haven't. They haven't. That's not true.

KIERAN GILBERT: Well, they've given — they've worked with the Government  throughout this process.

MITCH FIFIELD: But they have not ticked it off. The UNHCR is very clear, very adamant,  that they have not given the tick-off on this. Malaysia is not a signatory to the UN Refugee  Convention.

Now, the Labor Party could have offshore processing this week if they agreed to our very  simple amendment, which is that any country has to be a signatory to the UN Refugee  Convention. They could do that.

And Richard Marles was also talking about the Australian Labor Party wanting to break the  people smugglers' business model. It's important to remember that the business model that the  people smugglers have was designed by the Australian Labor Party. It was the ALP who got  rid of offshore processing…

KIERAN GILBERT: Okay.

MITCH FIFIELD: …who got rid of TVPs, and who softened their rhetoric.

KIERAN GILBERT: Well, you've had a good crack at that. Let's take a break. We'll be  right back on AM Agenda. Stay with us.

[Ad break]

KIERAN GILBERT: Welcome back to AM Agenda. With me this morning, Liberal  frontbencher, Senator Mitch Fifield, here in Canberra. And in Melbourne I've got Labor  frontbencher, Richard Marles.

Richard, bubbling underneath the surface this week — we've been talking about the key  legislative votes, but the ongoing chatter about Kevin Rudd. One of his former staff  members, his speech writer during Kevin Rudd's time as prime minister, Troy Bramston, has

written in The Australian newspaper this morning. He says: the reality now dawning on the  Caucus, there is no easy way out or a clear pathway to political survival. Like it or not, Rudd  is coming and so is Gillard's political execution. That's from Troy Bramston, as I say, a  former Kevin Rudd advisor.

What do you say to that, and do you concede that this talk is going to continue as long as the  primary vote's below 30 in the — in all of the opinion polls?

RICHARD MARLES: Well, this is media speculation. There's a fair bit of Opposition hope  and mischief associated with all of this as well. But this is principally media speculation, and  obviously we're going through difficult times in terms of the debates that we are pursuing and  the polls that are occurring. And so it's not surprising the media would speculate.

But what it isn't, is reality on the ground. The fact of the matter is the Caucus is 100 per cent  behind the Prime Minister who's doing a great job in very difficult circumstances. And in  terms of her support, that includes Kevin Rudd. I mean, he's made it clear in the last week  that he supports the way the Prime Minister is conducting her job. He said that he's not a  candidate, and he, like the rest of us, are 100 per cent behind her.

KIERAN GILBERT: The — you must concede, though, that the chatter isn't just media  speculation, that there are a lot of Labor people talking to the media on this front and that  there is a sense within in Labor that Mr Rudd, his profile in recent weeks, a handful of  marginal seats, reading to children, that his profile is not that which you'd normally see for a  foreign minister. He's been undertaking things which have not been typically in the brief of a  man in his portfolio.

RICHARD MARLES: I don't accept that. Kevin Rudd has been out there selling the  Government, as has every other senior minister. And of course, Kevin Rudd brings, as a  former prime minister, a profile to his job, which is a great asset for the Government and a  great asset for the country as the Foreign Minister. But it's nothing more than that.

And in terms of Labor MPs chattering to the media, well, what I do see today is the  comments from Mark Bishop, who of course was fingered by Graham Richardson last week.  But what Mark Bishop's made clear is he hasn't spoken to Kevin Rudd in months.

You know, what Richo said on his program last week is clearly just a fair bit of hot air and  speculation. I actually don't think there are a whole lot of Labor MPs talking up anything to  the media. I think what we're seeing is media speculation combined with a lot of Opposition  MPs desperately hoping that something might happen.

KIERAN GILBERT: Senator Fifield, that point that Richard Marles made about Mark  Bishop; he's quoted in The West Australian newspaper, an article by Andrew Probyn, in  which he says he played no part in this at all, goes through the chronology of events. It does  seem that there's been, according to him anyway, he's been attributed with something he's not  been involved in.

MITCH FIFIELD: Well, I don't know whether Mark Bishop has been involved or not, but  there's about 100 other members of the ALP Caucus. And Richard's wrong. This is not being  driven by a frenzied media, as he put it. This is being driven by the sheer and absolute terror  of Labor backbenchers in marginal seats who think they're going to be out of a job. That is  what is driving this. This is entirely internally driven by the ALP.

Now, for our part, we're not terribly fussed about the ambitions of Kevin Rudd or Julia  Gillard. And I might quote Labor here — they're very fond of talking about the national  interest all the time. Well, that's the real problem with this internal dynamic of the Labor  Party, is you've got Julia Gillard looking over her shoulder rather than doing her day job,  which is meant to be looking after the national interest.

KIERAN GILBERT: All right.

MITCH FIFIELD: That's the real problem.

KIERAN GILBERT: Senator Fifield and Richard Marles, gentlemen, good to speak to you  and thanks for the chat this morning. Appreciate it.

MITCH FIFIELD: Good to see you, Kieran.

RICHARD MARLES: Good to see you, Kieran.

KIERAN GILBERT: That's all for AM Agenda.
