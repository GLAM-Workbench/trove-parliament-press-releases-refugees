INTERVIEW WITH STUART BOCKING - RADIO 2UE, SYDNEY - 8.30PM TUESDAY 11 MAY  2010

11th May 2010

E&OE……………………….…………………………………………………………………

STUART BOCKING:

Joe, good evening.

JOE HOCKEY:

Good evening, Stuart.

STUART BOCKING:

Thank you very much for your time. I know noticed earlier on you’ve accused the Government of  being allergic to tough decisions. What do you base that on?

JOE HOCKEY:

Well, it’s a shameless con job. The Government is effectively basing its wish and a hope and a prayer  that it will one day deliver a surplus on the back of what they claim to be the best terms of trade in 60  years. Now, you don’t get those best terms of trade in 60 years, you do not get record levels of  investment in mining if you are putting a $9 billion a year tax on mining.

STUART BOCKING:

And so obviously you’re saying there that this is the absolute best case scenario. It’s interesting the  way this has played out, I took this up with the Treasurer earlier on. A Budget deficit comes in tonight  of $40.8 billion for the year going forward. Just one year ago they were forecasting a deficit $16  billion beyond that and so it’s come in better than expected. Given that sort of wiggle room in the  space of 12 months, how much store can you put in some of these estimates going forward,  particularly as we get further and further out in those forward estimates?

JOE HOCKEY:

Well you can’t, Stuart. It is flawed logic. They’re trying to claim credit for a surplus they may deliver  in three years time. That’s what they’re trying to do tonight. They’re trying to claim economic  credibility for something that they might deliver in three years time.

Now, this is the biggest ‘trust me’ claim I have ever heard of. It is ‘trust me, we’ll make savings’.  ‘Trust me, that we’ll have unbelievable economic conditions’. ‘Trust me, that Greece will have no  impact’. ‘Trust me, that we are going to save money’. But, understand this, Stuart - they’re allocating  a billion dollars tonight of new money to address their failed asylum seeker policy. They’re spending  a billion dollars to fix their pink batt programme. Kevin Rudd promised no more health public  servants with his new hospital plan. Tonight, in the Budget papers, is half a billion dollars for new  public servants in health.

STUART BOCKING:

One of the other things, and obviously I mentioned, I touched on this earlier on, there is this proposal  to deliver another 23 new super GP clinics which is a great idea in theory but in the lead up to the last  election 31 of those were promised as well by this now Government. So far only three of those are  fully operational. Based on that, how long might it be before we have an additional 23 as being  proposed tonight?

JOE HOCKEY:

Well, the never never and this is the way the Government does things. It does things on the never  never. For example, on skills, education and employment they claim a new programme, and basically  it’s re-badging existing money, they’re claiming to invest in new skills investment packages.

The most alarming thing for me tonight, I was Minister for Employment and we got unemployment in  Australia down to four per cent. We left them with an unemployment rate of four per cent. Tonight in  the Budget papers they said they believe full employment is 4.75 per cent. They are leaving 75,000  Australians without any hope and if that’s the best they can do then it says everything about what they  really, what they really mean in their words.

STUART BOCKING:

The move towards streamlining the completion of tax returns for most income earners like myself and  others, obviously a good measure on the face of it because it is one of those things around tax time.  There are a number of businesses though, like ITP and others, that rely on that sort of work for a large  part of their business. What does it do many of those companies that we move to streamline, make it  easier to complete those tax returns.

JOE HOCKEY:

Well, we support the simplification of the tax return but Stuart, it’s not real.  I mean, we’ll see what it  comes out you know, they’re employing more people in the tax office.  I’d like the idea of a  simplified tax return but like so many other things you’ve got to get to the bottom of it.

For example, they claim they were going to have, in this Budget, they’re going to have a major new  initiative to encourage people to increase their savings. Well, the total value to someone is $3 a week  and it was supposedly the centrepiece of their savings in the Budget, savings initiatives in the Budget.

STUART BOCKING:

Is there something that has impressed you tonight?

JOE HOCKEY:

Their ability to spin.

STUART BOCKING:

You’re all good at that. Surely, you’re not going to give them any credit. You’re all good at that.

JOE HOCKEY:

Well, mate let me tell you I just - this creation of false hope is what I really get upset about. The false  hope and what that does it leads people down the garden path and that’s what I get upset about. I’d  rather have people speak the truth and be upfront and honest about it than play games with it.

STUART BOCKING:

Alright, I know you’re pushed for time. I appreciate your time. I’m sure we’ll chat again in the  morning. All the best.

JOE HOCKEY:

Any time. Thanks.
