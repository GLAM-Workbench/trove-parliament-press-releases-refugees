PRESENTER:

Let's go back to politics now and renewed speculation that Labor's Budget surplus is under  intense pressure this morning. Joe Hockey is the Opposition's Treasury spokesman. He joins  us from Parliament House. Good morning to you.

JOE HOCKEY:

Good morning Michael.

PRESENTER:

It's fair to say that the Australian Government and, for that matter, every government in the  world that relies on resources exports is, at the moment, hostage to events completely out of  its control. That is a fair thing to say, isn't it?

JOE HOCKEY:

This Government has made itself hostage to higher commodity prices. We've been warning  for two years now that if the mining boom comes to an end the Budget will fall like a house  of cards. And what this Government has been doing is - it’s been saying one thing to one

person and something else to someone else. The net result is that the Government is going to  have to introduce new taxes to make up for its $120 billion black hole that has come about  through massive increases in spending in just the last few weeks. And that's all about shoring  up Julia Gillard's leadership of the Labor Party.



PRESENTER:

How do you quantify that $120 billion?

JOE HOCKEY:

Well, it's pretty obvious. You can't have a National Disability Insurance Scheme in Australia  which will cost up to $10 billion a year and only allocate $1 billion in the Budget as far as  you can see. You cannot afford to have a blow-out in asylum seeker costs. You cannot afford  to make new promises on dental care of $4 billion and not tell anyone where the money is  coming from. You cannot afford to commit to the Gonski review of education which could  cost up to $7 billion a year and not tell anyone where the money is coming from. And now -  today - it looks like Julia Gillard, in an extraordinary fashion, is going to give private sector  workers a wage subsidy to shore up her support in the Labor Party caucus and use taxpayers'  money to do it. Unbelievable stuff.

PRESENTER:

Now, the Coalition - you and your colleague Andrew Robb - have said on a number of  occasions that you're facing a $70 billion funding gap yourself?

JOE HOCKEY:

That's actually factually not right, Michael.

PRESENTER:

I'm quoting you and Andrew Robb directly from interviews you've done.

JOE HOCKEY:

I've said at the time - whatever the cost would be, 50, 60, 70, - whatever the cost, we will  meet this challenge, and we will meet the challenge. Wayne Swan has verballed me on this  and I won't accept it being repeated as if it is true.

PRESENTER:

Andrew Robb on Newsradio, on the 16 August 2011, said "We need to identify up to $70  billion".

JOE HOCKEY:

He said up to, and when he did that what we were saying was we will find the savings and we  have found the savings. But the bottom line is - this Government keeps making new  promises. I find it absolutely extraordinary that they seem to be getting away with making all  these massive new spending promises to shore up Julia Gillard's leadership of the Labor Party  and they're not explaining to Australians what taxes they're going to increase. Now, when  Penny Wong next says "We've saved $100 billion or $130 billion or $33 billion" whatever  the figure is, you ask them how much of those so-called savings are tax increases or new

taxes? Come clean. They're not actual savings. When you increase taxes they're not actually  savings. They're actually increasing the pain for everyday Australians and the Labor Party  doesn't understand that.

PRESENTER:

Now you say you've identified how you'd raise that up to $70 billion. Let's go back to your  assertion about the $120 billion in increased spending. Where does the Coalition - if it is to  win the next election - start? Do you not proceed with dental care? Do you not proceed with  the roll out of the National Disability Insurance Scheme? Do you wind back Gonski? How do  you get those extra savings?

JOE HOCKEY:

Well, this is a very good point, Michael, because the Government is making these promises  on an unfunded basis. So we're asking the questions “where are you getting the money  from?”- because how can we possibly offer an alternative Budget when the Government  keeps changing its own Budget with massive unfunded spending promises. The interesting  thing here is that the Labor Party's own caucus members, members of the parliamentary  Labor Party yesterday in their secret caucus meeting, started to complain about the fact that  the Government is making all of these commitments without telling Australians where the  money is coming from. So Julia Gillard has a rebellion in her own ranks on her unfunded  promises and her reckless expenditure and the Labor Party is not telling the Australian people  what tax comes next. We've seen that before. They said there would be no carbon tax under  the Government they lead. Well, now they've got to come clean. We won't let them get to  polling day without telling the Australian people where that money is coming from.

PRESENTER:

Well the Coalition will go to voters with at least one promise which will involve lots of  money - that is your version of the carbon tax, the Direct Action scheme. How much will that  cost?

JOE HOCKEY:

Well, you’ll see the details before the next election. Our Direct Action plan at the last election  was capped in funding and when we went to the last election we said this is how much we're  going to spend, not $1 more. Now from our perspective, it is important to deal with climate  change but we are not going to have what this Government has had and that is a new tax on  everyday Australians - a tax on everything, we'll get rid of that. But most significantly,  Michael, we are not going to keep changing things. This Government has changed the carbon  tax five times since it started on 1 July. That creates business uncertainty. What that leads to  is consumer uncertainty and at the end of the day that means that our economy is certainly  under-performing at a time when it could do a lot better.





PRESENTER:

By the sounds of it you're changing your Direct Action promise. How much was it capped at  at the last election? Just remind our viewers

JOE HOCKEY:

The last election we said, because it goes up to 2020, we had a figure of around $10 billion.  Over a 4-year period…

PRESENTER:

So you will cap it there for the next election?

JOE HOCKEY:

Over the forward period you will see our numbers before the next election. Because you  know what, Michael, the Government keeps changing their policies. They said, for example,  that they were going to buy out the big dirty coal-fired power stations. They gave the power  stations $1 billion and then they said they'd changed their mind. So you're asking us to give  you a fixed policy when what we're doing is effectively standing on water because the  Government keeps changing their policies, changing the settings upon which the Australian  people can judge us all.

PRESENTER:

Okay, just before we go a very quick final issue. Liberal Senator Cory Bernardi said  normalising same-sex marriage will normalise bestiality. What do you think about comments  like that?

JOE HOCKEY:

I didn’t see that particular comment.

PRESENTER:

That’s what he said to the Senate.

JOE HOCKEY:

Well, obviously, I don’t agree with that sort of thing. I think this needs to be a measured and  sensitive debate. People do have strong views - they are entitled to strong views, but frankly,  hysterics don’t help.

PRESENTER:

Are those comments embarrassing to the Coalition?







JOE HOCKEY:

Well, I’ve heard comments from the Labor Party that are embarrassing. If you are held  accountable for everyone’s words all the time, Michael, it gets a bit challenging. I’m sure you  find that at the ABC.

PRESENTER:

Sometimes we do. Joe Hockey in Canberra, thank you very much.
