LABOR’S ‘EAST TIMOR REFUGEE BRIBERY’ 
COMMENTS IRRESPONSIBLE AND MEAN-SPIRITED

Â

Northern Territory Senator Grant Tambling l ast night attacked 
Opposition Immigration spokesman Con Sciacca’s allegations that East 
Timorese refugees in Australia are being forced to return to their homeland 
on the enticement of a bag of rice and a tarp as “irresponsible and 
mean-spirited“.

Â

“To say that Australia has not done and will not 
continue to do the right thing by the people of East Timor, particularly 
with regard to humanitarian and refugee assistance, is ludicrous,” 
Senator Tambling said.

Â

“We are seeing the will of the East Timorese people 
being implemented.

Â

“Mr Sciacca’s comments regarding the return of 
East Timorese evacuees are ill-timed and extremely mean-spirited. Once 
again the ALP has irresponsibly stirred up a media feeding frenzy with 
these inaccurate, ill-informed comments,” said Senator Tambling.

Â

“The result has been coverage that has completely 
blown all the facts out of proportion and which is irresponsible.”

Â

Following UNHCR assurances that the security situation 
in East Timor has stabilised, the Federal Government has advised refugees 
remaining in Australia on ‘safe haven’ visas to return to their 
homeland ahead of the visas’ December 8 expiry date. However, the 
Australian Government has said that only those who wish to, and are 
fit to travel, will return to East Timor.

Â

“It is not the Australian Government but the United 
Nations giving the assurances that the situation in East Timor has stabilised. 
Claims that the East Timorese are being enticed to return with a bag 
of rice and a tarp is yet another fiction created by Labor and some 
people with a determination to politicise what should be a bipartisan 
position,” said Senator Tambling.

Â

“Many evacuees are very keen to return to their 
homeland to be reunited with family and friends - I do not find this 
surprising. What I do find surprising are the claims that people are 
being forced to return. They are not being forced.

Â

“Some 600 East Timorese have already returned to 
East Timor from Australia, and the voluntary nature of the return of 
these people is being verified by the UNHCR,” Senator Tambling said.

Â

Comments that the East Timorese were losing out on a possible $3000 
monetary incentive, as was paid to the recent evacuees from the Kosovo 
crisis, were dismissed as inequitable and irrelevant by Senator Tambling.

Â

“It  surprises me that a committed socialist such as Mr Sciacca 
may even be thinking about such a measure which is clearly nonsense. 
The ALP’s comparative plan to equate the two groups would only create 
pockets of advantage for a few, whereas the Australian Government’s 
response is far more equitable,” Senator Tambling said.

Â

“The situations are not comparable. Australia did 
not play a major role in the NATO operation in Kosovo; even though we 
played a ‘good neighbour’ role, it cannot be compared with our ‘good 
and near neighbour’ policies towards East Timor,” he said.

Â

Australia’s neighbourly assistance in the more recent 
East Timor situation amounted to a major role in terms of military participation 
and humanitarian aid. A total of some $74 million in foreaign aid has 
thus far been contributed to the troubled province on top of the $1 
billion, 5500 Australian Defence Force personnel commitment - the 
largest such package Australia has ever offered to an international 
humanitarian crisis.

Â

The most recent announcement of a $60 million aid 
package by the Minister for Foreign Affairs Mr Downer comprises $34 
million to ensure that longer term administrative, reconstruction and 
development goals are achieved in the transition to independence under 
UN authority; another $23 million to meet the immediate needs of the 
East Timorese people; and a further $3 million for refugees in West 
Timor.
