E&OE……………………….………………………………………………………………………………..

STEVE PRICE:

Mr Abbott, good morning.

TONY ABBOTT:

G’day Steve.

STEVE PRICE:

Got Andrew Bolt here with me as well. You’re in Echuca for the Murray Darling Basin Authority  information session. The last time this meeting took place there one of the local residents turned up with a  noose around her neck. We then had the burning of that report in the town of Griffith. Does the heat seem to  have come out of this a little bit, this debate?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I’m not so sure about that. I was in Forbes last week and there were a couple of thousand pretty  anxious people there. This is by far the biggest issue facing regional Australia. If the plan goes ahead in its  current form it will rip the guts out of regional economies and that’s got to be bad for our country but it’s  typical of the Rudd-Gillard Government that they make decisions first and think about it afterwards.

STEVE PRICE:

Well, the plan though was formed on legislation introduced by the former Howard Government wasn’t it?

TONY ABBOTT:

To put it bluntly, when it comes to all of this, Steve, we set it up and they’ve stuffed it up. They’ve  completely bungled all of this. They’ve now belatedly accepted that the socio-economic impact of all of this  should be very seriously considered, but that’s not the riding instructions that the Murray-Darling Basin  Authority has been given and it’s typical of this Government which is constantly on a lean to the Greens that  they would have put environmental considerations way ahead of the survival of our agricultural sector.

ANDREW BOLT:

Tony, it’s not just a question of the Green agenda going absolutely wild again, we’ve seen it in the power  area, we’ve seen it in the domestic, in urban water supply and now we are seeing it here with the farmers.  What I think many people don’t understand is that a lot of these cuts are to keep the Menindee Lakes at the  end of the Murray, with all the fresh water there, when normally there would be salt water in low flow times  and all the evaporation, all these farmers, the water’s being ripped off farmers because of evaporation in the  Menindee Lakes that are man made.

TONY ABBOTT:

Down at Lake Alexandrina…

ANDREW BOLT:

Lake Alexandrina I mean, sorry, yes.

TONY ABBOTT:

… and elsewhere, Andrew, yes. I think that’s a good point. Look, we do need to get more water into the  river, but the point that people keep making over and over again is that we can’t destroy the farm to save the  river. We’ve got to preserve the river and at the same time preserve our agricultural sector. One of the ways  to do this was to improve the infrastructure and the Howard Government set aside $5.8 million to improve  the infrastructure which would mean that the same quantum of water would go further and the Rudd-Gillard  Government has, it’s ahead of schedule in terms of the water buybacks but it’s way behind schedule in terms  of the infrastructure and that’s because essentially under the influence of the Greens, this Government just  doesn’t like irrigation…

STEVE PRICE:

So, what will you tell the farmers there today?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I’ll tell them that I’m not here to dictate to them because I think governments which dictate rather than  listen are governments which make terrible mistakes. I’ll be telling them that the tragedy is that not a single  Government minister has turned up to any of these consultations, whereas just about all of the consultations  have had senior Coalition representation. The interesting thing, Steve, is that in Canberra the various  government ministers hide behind the Authority but out there in the regions the Authority keeps saying its  hands are tied by government.

ANDREW BOLT:

Classic pass the parcel, yeah. Can I move onto boat people, Tony? We’ve had in just five days, we’ve had  six boats bring in 328 more people. That’s almost as much as will fit into the new Inverbrackie detention  centre for 400 in South Australia. Clearly they can’t keep building a new detention centre every week at this  rate. What on earth is the answer now?

TONY ABBOTT:

You’ve got to stop the boats. That’s the point. You just have to stop the boats. That’s the only way,  otherwise we’ll have detention centres dotting out country and the flow will just increase. Now, I went out to  Inverbrackie last week. Inverbrackie is like an idyllic suburb and ok, the houses aren’t big but they were

perfectly acceptable military accommodation from 20 odd years ago. I think there were lots of Australian  families that would quite frankly think that this was a great place to live and the point I made to the locals at  Inverbrackie is that I want every Australia to have a chance to live in a beautiful community like Woodside  but…

STEVE PRICE:

So did you raise this, Tony, did you raise this with Hillary Clinton yesterday, this idea of a regional centre  for handling boat people?

TONY ABBOTT:

No, I didn’t because it’s not really an American issue and I didn’t want to embarrass Hillary Clinton by  doing it.  But I’m sure that the Americans would understand what all serious people understand that we can’t  ask countries like East Timor to solve our problems, I mean we’ve got to solve our problems. We can’t  dump our problems onto East Timor.

ANDREW BOLT:

Yeah. Tony, you had the Party’s Treasurer, Michael Yabsley, telling you, well, warning you that the party is  in danger of going broke, going bankrupt and he’s attacked the Federal Director, Brian Loughnane and the  President, Alan Stockdale. What’s the problem here? Is he onto something here?

TONY ABBOTT:

No, look, two points. First of all, Brian Loughnane did a terrific job during the campaign. I mean, it takes a  very good campaign to bring a first term incumbent to the brink of defeat. This was the best campaign by an  Opposition in almost 80 years because it’s the first time in almost 80 years that a first term government has  lost its majority.

ANDREW BOLT:

The main thing is you, the party going broke, is that what the story is?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, the second point Andrew is that political parties spend money during election campaigns and you’d  expect the party to spend its accumulated war chest during an election campaign. I mean, any political party  which finishes an election campaign with millions of dollars in the bank is crazy. Absolutely crazy. You  don’t get the money to hoard it. You get the money to win elections. So, the Party has simply done what all  sensible political parties do, it’s spent its money in the election campaign. Now, obviously we now need to  raise more money because we never know when there’ll be another election campaign and in the meantime  there’s a party to run but I think to criticise a political party for not having much money left in the bank at  the end of an election campaign is silly, frankly.

STEVE PRICE:

We’ll let you go talk to the farmers, thanks for your time.

TONY ABBOTT:

Thanks Steve, thanks Andrew.
