PEOPLE SMUGGLERS STILL IN BUSINESS



“The interception and detention by Indonesian authorities of 12 Iranian asylum seekers  bound for Australia is a credit to Indonesian police,” Shadow Minister for Immigration and  Citizenship Dr Sharman Stone MP said today.

“The 12 Iranians were reported to have told the police that they were hoping to travel on to  Australia to start a better life. Clearly the people smugglers are still in business and still  believe that they can sell a permanent residence outcome for their clients. No doubt they  have been encouraged by the Rudd government’s most recent moves to softening its  position in relation to unauthorised arrivals.

“Indonesia has now intercepted over 1,000 asylum seekers since late last year when the  Rudd Labor Government weakened our strong people smuggling policies.

“The Coalition has grave concerns that as the government continues to unwind our integrity  and security measures, by for example, abolishing detention debt and weakening character  provisions; introducing a “Complementary Protection visa” and abolishing the 45-day rule,  lives will be lost at sea or years will be wasted in detention in Indonesia.

“The Government must work closely with Indonesian officials but also take responsibility for  the steadily growing number of asylum seekers now attempting to push off from Indonesia.  Clearly the people smugglers pipeline is highly profitable and they are successfully recruiting  from countries under pressure to our north.

The Government’s rhetoric and actions must be consistent otherwise people smugglers will  continue to sell the Government’s softening of our policies as a green light to enter  Australia,” Dr Stone concluded.
