CHRISTMAS MESSAGE BY THE ACTING PRIME MINISTER  THE RT. HON. J.D. ANTHONY C.H., M.P.

My wife and I wish all Australians a safe and enjoyable  Christmas,  and a happy and satisfying New Year.

In many ways 1982 has been a difficult year, with one of the  worst droughts on record,  and the world recession hitting our  economy hard.  We cannot escape the fact that these difficultes  will have a continuing impact on 1983.

But I have profound and complete confidence that provided we  are realistic,  Australia can look to the future with optimism. As a nation we have very great strengths.  We need to make the  most of these strengths,  and the abilities of our people.

The strong desire and determination throughout the nation to  see problems faced realistically is very encouraging. The  community is responding by showing that it understands the  present difficulties. There is a growing recognition that we

cannot expect to take out more than we put in. I believe people  are more and more willing to accept the need for moderation, and  to work together with a concern for the well-being of all  Australians.

The message of concern for others,  of goodwill to all, is  very much the message of the great festival of Christmas. It is  one we should all bear in mind not just at Christmas, but  throughout the coming year. We all stand to benefit from coÂ­  operation, and from putting aside sectional and selfish

interests.

We cannot afford to forget that the opportunities which  should be available for all Australians, especially our children,  will only be achieved through our own efforts.  With a strong  spirit of co-operation, we can keep building the kind of  Australia we want and the way of life we believe in.

Again I extend the compliments of the season to all  Australians. Please take care,  especially on the roads, and  remember - don't drink and drive.

Canberra, 23 December, 1982
