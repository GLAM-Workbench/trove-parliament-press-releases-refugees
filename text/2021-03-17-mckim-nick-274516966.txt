MEDIA RELEASE  NICK MCKIM 17 MAR 2021 IMMIGRATION AND CITIZENSHIP

Australia has an obligation to refugees who have contracted COVID

Refugees that the Australian Government exiled to Papua New Guinea contracting COVID should prompt their immediate evacuation to Australia, Greens Immigration spokesperson Nick McKim says.

“For years, Labor and Liberal Governments have deliberately withheld adequate medical treatment from people in their care,” Senator McKim said.

“The refugees who have contracted COVID need to be medevacced to Australia, and all other refugees in PNG need to be brought to Australia to prevent them contracting the illness.”

“With COVID now out of control in Papua New Guinea, all remaining refugees must be brought to Australia.”

“Their immune systems have been damaged by eight years of brutality, and they are particularly susceptible to disease.”

“It is unconscionable for Peter Dutton to continue to try to wash his hands of responsibility for refugees who sought Australia’s protection and remain in his duty of care.”
