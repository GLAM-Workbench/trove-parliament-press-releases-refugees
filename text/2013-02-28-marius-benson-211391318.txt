INTERVIEW WITH MARIUS BENSON  ABC NEWS RADIO



Topics: Western Sydney, public services, taxes, asylum seekers

E&OE…………………………………………………………………………………….  ANNOUNCER:

Next week there will be a political shoot out in Sydney’s west with Tony Abbott  following Julia Gillard’s lead and heading in to the electorates that may hold the key  to September’s election. It’s a clear sign that politics has, in Paul Keating’s phrase,  thrown the switch to Vaudeville. To look at the show and the substance of politics  this morning, Marius Benson is speaking to the Shadow Finance Minister, Andrew  Robb.

MARIUS BENSON:

Andrew Robb, the Prime Minister came under criticism from some quarters when  she announced she would be spending next week in western Sydney, it was  described as a political stunt. Now Tony Abbott is going to western Sydney as well;  is it pretty true they are both stunts?

ANDREW ROBB:

Not at all. Tony Abbott has been to western Sydney, since the last election, on  average nearly once a fortnight. So this is a regular part of his program. He is not  going to alter his program just to give the Prime Minister the opportunity to get the  Melways out and spend some time out in western Sydney.

MARIUS BENSON:

I’m not sure the Melways will help in western Sydney.

ANDREW ROBB:

Well the road maps are necessary for the prime minister in many parts of the  country. But that is their problem. Look, they will do what they will do. She said she  was going to govern, not campaign, and now she has got her swag going out to  western Sydney for a week.

MARIUS BENSON:

Could I ask you about your policies because you’re in the policy engine room of the  Coalition and it is quite possible that you will be the government on September 15,  now, you have a lot of policies out there; let me fence it in with a very narrow  question.

When John Howard came in to office in 1996, he had one way of approaching new  government. In 2007 Kevin Rudd had a different approach, on one particular issue,  John Howard sacked the heads of the public service departments. There was the  night of the long white envelopes. Kevin Rudd did not do that. Will Tony Abbott get  rid of the heads of public service departments as John Howard did?

ANDREW ROBB:

Look our focus totally has been to date on the programs that will turn this country  around, that will restore certainty. We are not focussing on individuals within the  public service or those sorts of issues.

MARIUS BENSON:

So no decision on sacking or not sacking public service chiefs?

ANDREW ROBB:

No.

MARIUS BENSON:

Can I ask you about another part of the policy which is stressed by Tony Abbott?  Lower taxes. And another point that you make is that 16 members of the Shadow  Cabinet served in the John Howard ministry, so you have ministerial experience from  those times, and your intention is to lower taxes. John Howard in 12 years did not  lower taxes. When he left, taxes were at the same level as when he came in.

ANDREW ROBB:

Look, we are determined to reduce costs. This is a government that has not only  increased taxes, 27 new taxes, new and increased taxes ..

MARIUS BENSON:

Well in fact Labor will tell you taxes are running, tax revenue is now running below  what John Howard was achieving as a percentage of the GDP, but can I bring you to  that narrow point, the Howard government didn’t lower taxes.

ANDREW ROBB:

What I am saying to you is, that they have at the same time as increased taxes, they  have added nearly over a quarter of a trillion dollars to gross debt, over $150 billion  dollars to net debt, now that is deferred taxation. That has to be paid back, and the  fact of the matter is, they are the highest spending, and when you add in the  borrowings, the highest taxing government in Australia’s history.

MARIUS BENSON:

Can I leave a future Coalition government there, and ask you about a current issue  which is asylum seekers. Your colleague Scott Morrison has called for an immediate  suspension of community releases, the community release program, because of  charges brought against a Sri Lankan asylum seeker of sexual assault. Do you  support Scott Morrison in that?

ANDREW ROBB:

Absolutely. It is certainly a wake up call. There are 8,700 people who have been  released on bridging visas pending assessment who the government has absolutely  no idea where they live. Now this program should be suspended pending a review to  determine new protocols of how they are released and this is a wake up call for the  government.

MARIUS BENSON:

I’ll leave it there. Andrew Robb, thanks again.

ANDREW ROBB:

Thanks, Marius.
