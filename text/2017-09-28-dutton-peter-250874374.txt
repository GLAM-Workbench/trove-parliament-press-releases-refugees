RAY HADLEY:

Minister good morning to you.

PETER DUTTON:

Good morning Ray.

RAY HADLEY:

You're in London on home security, correct?

PETER DUTTON:

Yes correct. We've got a series of meetings here with MI5, with the Met Police  looking at the counter-terrorism response here and obviously a lot of work that we're  doing on border protection and exchanging information with our Customs and Border  Protection services. So we've just arrived, so yeah, a good visit.

RAY HADLEY:

Okay. The big story here today is that gas producers Origin, Santos and Shell have  agreed to ensure there's enough supply after the meeting with the Prime Minister Mr  Turnbull and the threat by the Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce that if they didn't  toe the line there'd be drama.

Now, while that's fantastic, it appears now that after getting some sort of guarantee  from AGL's boss Andy Vesey that they’d keep Liddell open beyond its life at 2022,  that all of a sudden it appears that AGL are saying, no, no, it's closing in 2022, we're  going to buy a big battery - just like they've got in South Australia. Do you know  much about it?

PETER DUTTON:

I've read a bit about it and I know the Prime Minister's really been engaged on this as  you would expect. We had a big discussion in Cabinet about it earlier this week, but  we do need to make sure that the lights stay on.

I mean the South Australian experience where they turned coal off when they've got  renewables that don't work all the time, you do get blackouts and that's unacceptable  in a country like ours in the 21st century.

So I think the PM's done a great job in getting this landed and providing the  guarantee of that supply.

The Liddell situation's a difficult one because you've got a private company. The  Government's obviously been very keen to see the life of Liddell extended because  without that again you'll have disruption to the power supply.

Now AGL's saying that they've got some way around that. We'll wait to see what they  have to say. But the Government's been absolutely determined in saying that we  want to make sure that we don't have blackouts, that we have security of that supply  and that we have affordable power prices.

This issue's been boiling for many, many, many years and the state governments  with 100 per cent renewable targets, I mean, it's just a recipe for disaster for families  and small businesses.

So I think people are seeing the successful business person in Malcolm Turnbull  coming out and hopefully we can sort out this Liddell mess as well.

RAY HADLEY:

Look we've got these people being moved to the United States of America. We're  told they're going to go to Georgia, Oregon, Colorado, Texas and Arizona. And it's  been portrayed that they've led this terrible life on Nauru and Manus Islands. I don't  know if you saw the front page of the Daily Telegraph this week, but the headline  was, “Long Flight to Freedom, Manus to Manhattan.” It looked like a fashion show on  a catwalk somewhere in Paris or New York. I mean designer sunglasses.

Where do the people get the money to buy all the gear, the clobber, to leave Manus  and make a new life? I mean is that us paying for all this stuff?

PETER DUTTON:

Well Ray, there's a lot of people that, you know, have made a lot of mischief over a  long period of time. I did see the front page of the Daily Tele and it demonstrates  what you and I have been discussing for a long time and that there are a lot of  people that haven't come out of war ravaged areas, they're economic refugees,  they've got on a boat, paid a people smuggler a lot of money.

Somebody once said to me that the world's biggest collection of Armani jeans and  handbags up on Nauru waiting for people to collect when they depart.

The reality is that these people had, at the generosity of the Australian taxpayer,  received an enormous amount of support for a long period of time.

We didn't ask people to hop on the boats and we're getting them out including  through this US deal.

But we have been taken for a ride, I believe, by a lot of the advocates and people  within Labor and the Greens who want you to believe that this is a terrible existence.  These photos demonstrate otherwise. People have seen photos in recent weeks of  those up on Manus out, you know, enjoying themselves outside of the centre by the  beach and all the rest of it. Quickly they take down the photos from their Facebook  pages when they're discovered, but there is a very different scenario up on Nauru  and Manus than what people want you to believe.

But nonetheless, we want to get the centre up on Manus closed as quickly as  possible and the US deal that we've struck allows us to get many of those people off.

RAY HADLEY:

Yeah, but at the end of the day I mean it's about deterring them from coming to  Australia. If the opportunity is to go to either Orange or Oregon, it really won't make  much difference to them will it? I mean, given they're going to Georgia, Oregon,  Colorado and Texas. They might get a bit hotter reception in Texas than they're  expecting.

PETER DUTTON:

Well they might have to work as well. So that comes as a bit of a shock to some  people because they've been receiving three square meals a day, accommodation,  legal services all turned on. And the reality is that people wanted to come to  Australia, some wanted to come for work, others were happy to come for welfare. In  the end, we aren't going to allow those people to dictate when they come to our  country. We're not going to allow people smugglers back into business.

I've predicted for a long period of time that once these people are off Manus and  Nauru they'll start to tell a very different story that it wasn't that bad to wait a couple  of years to get this outcome.

And the boats are still there, people smugglers are still trying to put the boats  together and the problem hasn't gone away.

I thought the Labor Party had learned a lesson out of this, but they're slowly pulling  apart their policy. There's a big difference now between Labor and the Liberal Party  on Operation Sovereign Borders and I believe very strongly the boats would restart  again under a Shorten Government.

So there's a lot of lessons that should be learned that frankly at the moment the  Labor Party's denying the history of and I just think they need to be realistic about  the threat that still exists.

RAY HADLEY:

Okay. Hand on heart, you're a child of the 70s and 80s, but prior to this month have  you heard of Macklemore?

PETER DUTTON:

No I've got to say I didn't know him.

RAY HADLEY:

Okay the US rapper Macklemore was not something you play on a Sunday night at  home with the wife and kids?

PETER DUTTON:

No. It might be something the kids have on in the back of the car with the  headphones on, but not something I'm familiar with I'm sorry Ray.

But you know, when I take my kids to the footy, I want them to be able to watch the  footy. I don't want some political message jammed down their throat and I think  frankly that's how most Australians think.

So these key political messages that you get from companies now I think are -  whether it's the NRL or Qantas or anywhere else - I think they're worried that if  they're not acting politically correct that somehow they'll get a volley of abuse on  Twitter or on the Facebook.

RAY HADLEY:

The GetUp! will get up them.

PETER DUTTON:

Give me a break. I mean please get a backbone and stand up to some of this  political correctness.

My kids love the footy. I want to take my boys to watch the footy and I don't want the  betting ads jammed down their throat, I don't want the gay marriage message  jammed down their throat at the football.

Let's enjoy the finals time of the year without this sort of politically correct nonsense  taking place.

RAY HADLEY:

See my problem as a father of adult children is not so much about the song and I  mentioned - as you would've heard in the intro - that back in 2013 the Robertson  Brothers who provide all those great parodies for me actually wrote a parody to

Same Love and I recorded it with one of my daughters as a rap version. I had no  idea who sang it. It was about me not playing football and being a commentator, but  it was the Macklemore song that he's going to sing called Same Love.

But my point is - and I don't want to get involved in the same-sex debate because  I'm sick to the back teeth of it - but we have so many brilliant Australian acts. We've  got an accountant at the NRL who decided that Macklemore was the way to go. God  knows how much it's cost them. I mean, goodness knows how much it's cost them.

But we've got all these brilliant Australian acts we could line up and put there -  probably five of them for the price we're paying for Macklemore - but this accountant  decided, with his Deloitte background, that we'd go down that path.

My advice to Todd Greenberg is to put that bloke onto the balance sheet and leave  the entertainment to someone else.

PETER DUTTON:

Well I think that would be the response of most people who just want to see a good  game and see the Cowboys trounce Melbourne Storm.

RAY HADLEY:

…hang on a sec.

PETER DUTTON:

And most Queenslanders are just happy that there's no New South Wales team in  the finals. Just to point that out.

RAY HADLEY:

Well you know it's the first time in a long time that there's no - don't worry about New  South Wales teams - there's no New South Wales Origin player, current or former,  taking part in the Grand Final, according to the Telegraph today, for the first time in  decades.

PETER DUTTON:

Well Melbourne may have some hope in that scenario...

RAY HADLEY:

You should be divided because half of their team of course …

PETER DUTTON:

..I know, I know…

R



AY HADLEY:

… are Queenslanders, including their distinguished captain, captain of Australia,  captain of Queensland. Billy’s there, Cooper’s there. You might have to start having  a bet each way if you'll pardon the expression.

PETER DUTTON:

No I don't bet each way Ray, you know that.

I'm happy for the Cowboys to get up and I'm happy, please, not to have this stuff  jammed down our throats. Just allow people to enjoy the great game of rugby  league.

As you say, there'll be plenty of people - employees, followers of the NRL or  customers of Qantas - people that have got deeply held beliefs, people that have got  beliefs in traditional marriage and the rest of it and I think it's disrespectful for them.

So you know let people make their own judgements, form their own opinions, but  don't use our dime and don't use our time to try and convince us of the political  argument that you're putting. I just think people are smart enough to see through that  and frankly I think most of this stuff is counterproductive. I think you'll end up turning  people the other way.

RAY HADLEY:

Alright. Well have a safe trip and we'll see you when you get back.

PETER DUTTON:

Thanks Ray, see you mate.
