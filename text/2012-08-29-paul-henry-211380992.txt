29 August 2012

TRANSCRIPT OF THE HON. TONY ABBOTT MHR  INTERVIEW WITH PAUL HENRY,  TEN BREAKFAST

Subjects: Julia Gillard’s carbon tax; border protection.

E&OE……………………….…………………………………………………………………

PAUL HENRY:

Tony Abbott, good morning to you.

TONY ABBOTT:

`Morning, Paul.

PAUL HENRY:

Now the Government tells us that this gives business certainty, but I would have thought all this does is  increase the uncertainty for business.

TONY ABBOTT:

Exactly right. The carbon tax is already a policy that has failed and less than two months into the carbon tax  we’ve got these panicked adjustments to the carbon tax because the Government is finally getting the  message that this is a dog of a tax. But the point I keep making, Paul, is you can't fix this bad tax, you’ve  just got to scrap it.

PAUL HENRY:

Alright, well the other point that this makes, loud and clear, is that you cannot trust this Government to do  what it says. It was only, what, 24 hours ago now that the floor price was absolutely locked in, nothing was  going to change.

TONY ABBOTT:

That’s right, Paul. They were saying just a few days ago you had to have a floor price to give business  certainty. Now they’ve scrapped that. They were saying, when Kevin Rudd suggested it, that to do what they  have done today would blow out the Budget and they are absolutely right. If the price is high, the economy  is devastated. If the price is low, the Budget is devastated. So, either way, you just can't trust this mob.

PAUL HENRY:

And of course we don’t know what the price is going to be. We have got some modelling, but we have no  idea what the price is going to be. At the moment, Tony, the price is about $9.80 a tonne. Now, what this  means is that business leaders, sensibly business leaders, perhaps, would be purchasing credits now. So what  happens when you scrap this tax to those businesses that have invested in credits?

TONY ABBOTT:

They can then go back and sell those credits on the European market. So this myth that Greg Combet was  peddling that this somehow makes the carbon tax harder to repeal is just nonsense. The point that the public  needs to understand - laws that the Parliament makes are laws that the Parliament can unmake. Something  that is put in place by legislation can be taken away by legislation and the first act of the new Parliament,  should the Coalition form a government, will be to introduce the carbon tax repeal legislation.

PAUL HENRY:

Alright, this is quite important what you’ve just said because, as you say, the Government are saying that  this just makes it so much harder for you to repeal the carbon tax. What you are saying is businesses that do  invest, you don't have to compensate them. The taxpayer doesn't have to. They can sell on the open market.

TONY ABBOTT:

Exactly right. Anyone who go and buys a European credit tomorrow can just sell it back in the European  system.

PAUL HENRY:

Alright. Greg Combet is saying this morning that you have no right to comment on this because there are so  many holes in your own policy.

TONY ABBOTT:

This is typical of an arrogant and out of touch government. I represent the alternative government of our  country. I represent all of those people who think that the carbon tax is a bad tax based on a lie. That’s who I  am speaking up for. I am speaking up for the workers whose jobs are threatened by this tax, the families  whose cost of living is hurt by this tax and the idea that I should somehow be gagged is just bizarre; typical  of the government, though, that is always trying to intimidate and gag its opponents.

PAUL HENRY:

Well and perhaps typical of a government that keeps things very much to itself. Did you have any  knowledge of this prior to the announcement yesterday that they were going to change the playing field?

TONY ABBOTT:

It’s been well known for some weeks that a desperate government was trying to change the carbon tax to try  to pretend that somehow it wasn't going to hurt as much as it already is hurting. So we all knew that change  was in the offing, but all that this change proves is that you can't trust this government to get things right.

PAUL HENRY:

Alright. Let's move on from the carbon tax. The good thing is we have, still, your absolute commitment that  you’re going to repeal this and this doesn't make it any harder for you to do that.

TONY ABBOTT:

That’s correct.

PAUL HENRY:

Alright. Asylum seekers, very quickly, a new record has been set for Australia. Asylum seeker arrivals on  32  boats this month have reached 1,864. It’s a new record. The previous record was held last month at  1,798.  Now, Tony, by my calculation, Manus and Nauru are almost full already. So this policy isn't going to  make one jot of difference.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well they aren't even open. That’s the thing. I mean, when John Howard announced Nauru, within 19 days  of him announcing it, it was up and running. Now, this is a government which just endlessly procrastinates  about everything. They said a fortnight or so back that the most important thing was to get legislation  through, allowing them to open Nauru. Well, we got up, after a fortnight of Parliament, and they hadn't even  put the regulation into the Parliament that would enable them to do it.

PAUL HENRY:

Sure but I suppose my point, though, Tony, is even if it was up and running now, it would be full already. So  what do you do with the next lot of asylum seekers that arrive?

TONY ABBOTT:

The problem has always been, Paul, that this Government's heart is not in it. If you want to get the right  results, you have got to have the right resolve and this is not a government which has the right resolve. This  is a government which has been a soft touch for people smugglers from start to finish. They announced  Nauru and then they dawdle along, don't get the regulation through the Parliament, don't seem to be doing  anything much on the ground in Nauru. Is it any wonder that the boats keep coming because the people  smugglers know that this government is a soft touch.

PAUL HENRY:

You’re right and to prove that they’re a soft touch is the fact that they started off saying all of the people  arrive post this date will be heading off to Nauru or Manus and now they are saying, ‘you may head off  there’. Just before you go Tony, you’re in Townsville and I was going to ask why but there’s no need to ask  why, because you’ve tweeted this picture of yourself with the Townsville Triathlon Club. Was this this  morning, you were taking part in a triathlon?

TONY ABBOTT:

No look, I wasn’t taking part in a triathlon, but I did run up Castle Hill with the local tri club and they very  graciously, Paul, agreed to go at my pace which was rather slower than I think their normal gazelle-like pace  up the hill.

PAUL HENRY:

Oh you’re being humble. Tony, thank you very much for joining us this morning. Looks like a lovely day in  Townsville. You enjoy it.
