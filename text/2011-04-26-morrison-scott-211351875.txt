E&OE……………………….…………………………………………………………………

TONY ABBOTT:

It’s good to be here at Christmas Island with my friends and colleagues Scott Morrison and Michael Keenan.  We’ve had so far a briefing from the Administrator and also a briefing from the police commander here on  the Island. Later on today we’ll be going to the various detention centres and obviously getting briefings  from Serco and from immigration officials here on Christmas Island.

I think it’s very important that senior leaders familiarise themselves as far as they can with the situation on  the ground. Plainly the situation here on Christmas Island has been extremely difficult and I think it’s timely  that myself and my senior shadow ministers are here.

Obviously the Government has made an announcement this morning. I want to say that this is a weak  response to the Government’s loss of control of our borders. Nothing that’s been announced today will stop  the boats or end the protests. The idea that you should reward rioters with temporary protection visas is just  wrong. It’s just wrong. Rioters should be rewarded with punishment not with temporary protection visas.

Scott, would you like to speak, and then Michael.

SCOTT MORRISON:

Well, Labor doesn’t have a legal problem here they have a ticker problem. What we’ve seen from this  Government time and time again is a failure of resolve. The lack of resolve now in handling this crisis of  their own making where we just launch from one terrible incident to another just shows they have no plan.  They haven’t got a Plan A let alone a Plan B to deal with this issue, as the detention centres descend further  and further into chaos. The Minister needs to explain in terms of his announcement today why he has failed  to take action to date. Out of the changes that he’s foreshadowed today, counteracts the opportunity that he  has had under existing laws to take action. That he failed to take action against those who are part of the plan  to scuttle SIEV 36 which blew up and people’s lives were lost. It doesn’t change the fact that he failed to act  when three rioters from here on Christmas Island were convicted of their involvement in those riots and yet

continue to hold on to their visas. This Minister has simply failed to act. He’s got a ticker problem not a  legal problem.

TONY ABBOTT:

Michael?

MICHAEL KEENAN:

What we’ve had confirmed to us this morning is how serious the incident was when the Commonwealth  took control over the IDC on Christmas Island. The Government’s response typically is to move people  around the detention network, effectively to shift that problem to the mainland, to other detention centres.  This is why we’ve seen increasing unrest on the Australian mainland as well. This problem won’t be  resolved until they show some resolve to actually stop the boats from coming in the first place. Whilst you  have increasing numbers of people arriving and people not being returned home the pressures that resulted  in the events at Christmas Island are going to continue and we’re going to continue to see this loss of control  over our detention network.

TONY ABBOTT:

And obviously before I go to questions I should make the point that there is a better way. In December 2007  there were just four illegal boat arrivals in immigration detention. Now they are more than 6,500 in  immigration detention and this is a result of a succession of policy failures by the Rudd-Gillard Government.

QUESTION:

[Inaudible]

TONY ABBOTT:

No, what I’m saying is that we support tough border protection policies. For a long time now we’ve been  calling on the Government to a) reintroduce temporary protection visas for all who come illegally by boat, b)  have better and stronger relationships with close countries like Indonesia, c) have rigorous offshore  processing including reopening the detention centre in Nauru, and d) you have got to reserve for yourself the  right as a sovereign government to turn around boats should that be practical. Now, the two things that the  Government should be doing today is they should be picking up the phone to the President of Nauru, say  let’s reopen the centre, and making temporary protection visas the rule for all people who come illegally by  boat. Now, as for this legislation, well, we’ll determine our position when we see it. Obviously we support  tough border protection but as I said this is a weak response for a problem of the Government’s own making.  It won’t stop the boats and it won’t end the protests.

QUESTION:

Are you not sure yet [inaudible]?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, look, we haven’t seen the legislation. I mean, this is a Government which has given us complete chaos  in border protection. This is a Government which found four people in immigration detention and now has  6,500 people in immigration detention.

QUESTION:

[Inaudible]

TONY ABBOTT:

I think we’ve got to be absolutely crystal clear. People who come to Australia illegally and who break the  law while in detention should have no hope of permanent residency in this country.

QUESTION:

[Inaudible]

TONY ABBOTT:

People who come to this country illegally and who break the law while in detention should have no hope of  permanent residency in this country. Now, that’s what I’ve been saying ever since these riots broke out.  People who break the law in immigration detention should have no hope of permanent residency in this  country. We have to send the strongest possible message to people smugglers. That’s what this Government  has not done, that’s why you’ve seen an explosion in immigration detention from four when the Howard  Government left office to more than 6,500 now.

QUESTION:

[Inaudible]

TONY ABBOTT:

We’ve got to send the people smugglers and their customers a very clear message, ‘you have no product to  sell,’ and the product that they have to sell under this Government is permanent residency in Australia, and  nothing that this Government has done today will stop the boats or end the protests.

QUESTION:

So should the Government take back control of detention centres [inaudible]?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think it’s very important that the Government should be in control of what’s happening in Australia and on  our borders, and what’s happened under this Government is that we have a detention system in crisis. We  have detention centres springing up everywhere. But as we’ve seen all of these detention centres are  currently subject to [inaudible].

QUESTION:

[Inaudible]

TONY ABBOTT:

I think it’s very important that we have a rigorous system of offshore processing and the strongest signal the  Government could send to the people smugglers and their customers would be to pick up the phone to the  President of Nauru, instead of a Government who is transferring the problem from offshore islands to  mainland Australia making a bad situation worse.

QUESTION:

[Inaudible]

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, it’s an admission of failure. I mean, this is a damning admission of failure. This is a Government  which has presided over a growing crisis for more than three years and only now are they saying ‘oh we’ve  got to do something.’ Now, this idea that you are going to give rioters temporary protection visas is  effectively rewarding people who deserve to be punished.

SCOTT MORRISON:

Six weeks ago Minister Bowen stood in front of the country and he said he would apply the general  character test under the existing law to deal with those who are rioting on Christmas Island. Just a week or  so ago he said he was going to [inaudible]. Now, when he’s been exposed for failing to act time and time  again under these existing laws, he comes up with this diversion about the need to change the law. We can  change laws, but we can’t change the fact that this Government has no desire to deal with this issue. That  can only be achieved by a change of government.

QUESTION:

Should Julia Gillard take a tough stand on human rights in China?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think that the main issue that she should be raising with the Chinese is the carbon tax and the fact is that  China is not going to inflict on its industry the same cost disadvantage that Julia Gillard is seeking to inflict  on Australian industry. What Julia Gillard should be working out while she’s in China is how wrong her  policies are because all they are going to do is export jobs and import emissions.
