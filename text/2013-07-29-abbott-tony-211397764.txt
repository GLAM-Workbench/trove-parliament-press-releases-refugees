TONY ABBOTT:

It’s lovely to be here at the Alfred Street Childcare Centre. It’s lovely to be here with Margie, who obviously  is very familiar with the childcare sector because she runs the St Ives Occasional Care Centre. Lovely to be  with Martin Zaiter, our candidate for Parramatta and with his family and this is obviously a family business.  I thank the Malek family for making Margie and Martin and myself so welcome; but really, I just want to  celebrate the childcare sector generally for the marvelous work they do. The future of Australia is in centres  like this right around our country and my job as the Leader of the Coalition, as the alternative prime  minister, is to try to make it easier for the families of Australia to access these centres, to try and make it  easier for centres like this one to flourish right around our country.

That’s why we want a Productivity Commission inquiry into childcare so that the childcare sector can better  reflect the realities of the modern Australian family; can better reflect the realities of the modern Australian  economy which is a 24/7 economy; and also can help better do its job which is not simply to mind our  children, but to help to educate them because these centres sure are looking after our kids, but they’re also  early childhood education centres and I think that’s very important.  They’re not just looking after kids, they  are actually developing our kids’ minds, our kids’ social skills. They’re helping to prepare them for the years  of formal education as they go on in life.

So lovely to be here, really pleased that we have got this Productivity Commission inquiry into how we can  make childcare more affordable and more accessible and that’s really part of our general thrust to reduce the  cost of living pressure on Australian families. The cost of childcare has increased by nearly 30 per cent over  the last three years. There are a range of factors in the increasing costs, but certainly it’s important that we  try to retain affordability and again that’s something that our Productivity Commission inquiry will be  addressing.

I’m here in Western Sydney; there are a lot of pressures on the families of Western Sydney. The carbon tax  is driving up their power bills and gas bills and of course there’s the usual transport gridlock which is

2



experienced in Western Sydney, in particular. That’s why it’s so important that we get cracking with  WestConnex, and within 12 months of the election of a Coalition government, WestConnex will be under  way because we are putting $1.5 billion towards it - no string attached as it were, except getting going.  That’s the only condition. We just have to get this major transport infrastructure under way.

I suspect because this is a childcare centre, Margie might have something to say and then Martin might have  something to say and then obviously I will take some questions.

MARGIE ABBOTT:

Thank you, darling. Yes, I'm delighted to be here this morning. As a director of a community-based  childcare centre I wear many hats. I balance budgets; I grapple with increasing energy costs and  administrative costs. But the most important thing of all, and it was a joy today to be here, to see young  children learning, young children who are handling changes and learning in an environment that is strong  and positive. So thank you. Thanks, Alfred Street.

TONY ABBOTT:

Thanks darling. Martin.

MARTIN ZAITER:

Yes. Thank you. Good morning everyone. I would like to thank Margie and Tony, for coming out to  Parramatta. I welcome you. I would also like to acknowledge and thank the Malek family for welcoming us  today to the childcare centre. For the past 13 months my team and I have been to all corners of the  Parramatta electorate talking and listening to the people about their lives, their families, and their hopes for  our country; and from these discussions, it's quite clear that childcare is very important for all the  aspirational families in Parramatta, in Western Sydney. Other issues of concern are obviously the increasing  cost of living pressures, as well as the lack of modern infrastructure and the record levels of debt. And for  us, it's very important that the people of Parramatta, and the message to them and to all of Australia, is that  the next election they will have the clearest choice in a generation; and that is a choice between a further  three years of Labor's debt, deficits and broken promises, and a truly united Coalition Party with our Real  Solutions plan, that will bring back a stronger and prosperous economy and a safe and secure Australia.

Thank you.

TONY ABBOTT:

Ok, do we have any questions?

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott you acknowledge that childcare costs have gone up 30 per cent in just the last year, but when you  announced this Productivity Commission review you said that any changes would be within the existing  envelope. I'm assuming that means no more money. Have you rethought that, or is that still the case?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well it's very important to get our Budget under control and that means being very careful about additional  spending; but it's also important to grow our economy and if you can grow the economy, then obviously you  increase revenue and that means that you can increase social spending. Stronger social spending is the  dividend of a stronger economy. That's why a stronger economy is not just something for economists and  business people, a stronger economy is something for everyone because a stronger economy means more  jobs, it means higher wages, it means better services. The good thing about the Productivity Commission

3



inquiry is that a Productivity Commission is well placed to look at the economic spin-offs of improved  childcare. The Productivity Commission is well placed to consider what the impact of improved childcare  could be on economic growth and that's why I think they are the ideal body to look at this issue, if we are to  have the right childcare system for Australian families and also the right childcare system for the Australian  economy.

QUESTION:

Do you personally have a problem with the amount of regulation in the childcare sector at the moment?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, Margie might like to add to this. I have a problem with overregulation generally and it's interesting  that when the Rudd/Gillard Government came in they promised that they would not introduce any new  regulation without taking an old regulation out. They said they'd have this one in, one out rule. Well in fact  there are some 21,000 new regulations under this Government and I think they've only taken out about a  thousand. So, that's yet another broken promise from the Rudd-Gillard Government and yes, as I understand  it, there is a lot of additional red tape in the childcare sector but Margie, you are better placed than anyone to  talk about that.

MARGIE ABBOTT:

Well, look, my only comment on that is that handling regulation often means that you are not doing what  you should be doing, which is educating and working with young children. So, I think it is a matter of  striking the right balance and good policy underpins all of that.

QUESTION:

On the front pages of most of the major newspapers today was a picture of a 10-week-old Hazara child in a  casket who died on the way to Australia. We don't know that child's name. Should we?

TONY ABBOTT:

It was a tragic image, an absolutely tragic image and I think every Australian would be struck by the horror  of deaths at sea which are the constant accompaniment of the evil trade of people smuggling. Now, when I  say I want to stop the boats, I want to stop the deaths. If you don’t stop the boats, you don’t stop the deaths.  So, as long as people are taking to the sea in these unsafe boats, on dangerous voyages, we will see these  deaths. So, it's not only the right thing to do, it's the compassionate thing to do to stop the boats. If we stop  the boats we'll stop the drownings and we won't again see harrowing images, awful images, really heart  wrenching images like the one you refer to.

QUESTION:

Tony Burke says the first people will be transferred to Papua New Guinea by the end of this week. It’s  fitting within the two week timeline that he set out at the beginning. When you see those first transfers, will  you consider this the first success of this policy?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, obviously if the Government is to be taken seriously it does actually need to back up its words with  deeds. So far, this is a Government which is much better at making announcements on border protection but  it's hopeless at actually delivering. So, this Government needs to do two things: first of all, it needs to send  people to PNG for processing as it's been claiming it would do since late 2011; then it's actually got to bring  about resettlement. It's got to bring about resettlement. It's not enough merely to send people to PNG,

4



although they're pretty slow and hesitant about doing even that, but having sent people to PNG, people have  got to be resettled in PNG and there is enormous doubt over whether that will ever actually happen.

QUESTION:

You have got some concerns about some of the infrastructure on Manus Island at this stage. Would a  Coalition government commit significant money to improve that infrastructure and continue the support of  that policy?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, a Coalition government established the Manus island processing centre in PNG. John Howard was the  Prime Minister who actually sent people to Manus Island. Under the current Government they first talked in  late 2011 of sending people to Manus and almost two years later the capacity of the Manus centre is just 300  - just 300. So, not only have they not substantially expanded the centre, they have not yet actually sent  anyone there, let alone resettled people in PNG. So, sure, we will make full use of the offers that friendly  neighbours have made to Australia to help deal with this problem, but under the Coalition it would be  tackled with vigour and decisiveness. This Government never actually gets anything much done in this area  because its heart just never seems in it.

QUESTION:

You and Scott Morrison have both said that you will retain what you can from this PNG solution. Is that an  admission that turning back the boats, temporary protection visas and offshore processing and Operation  Sovereign Borders is not enough?

TONY ABBOTT:

We've always said that we support processing in PNG. We invented processing in PNG. I mean really it was  John Howard who established the Manus Island centre. It was Kevin Rudd who closed down all of the  offshore centres. I mean let's never forget Mr Rudd's record. Mr Rudd now says he believes in offshore  processing, but this is the guy who closed the whole system down in 2008 because he wasn't man enough to  leave well enough alone; and 50,000 illegal arrivals later, almost 800 illegal boats later, tragically more than  1,000 deaths at sea later, $10 billion-plus in border protection blowouts later he suddenly says ‘uh-huh, I  believe in offshore processing’. Well, really you've got to judge this individual by what he's done, by his  deeds, not simply by his words.

QUESTION:

Experts seem to be divided today about what to do in terms of managing the economy. Is it the Coalition's  policy to get back to a surplus as soon as possible or would it be prudent to cut where necessary or raise  taxes?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, what we've got is a Government which is panic over the state of the Budget. The reason why it's  highly unlikely that we will go to an election on August 31st, as Labor had planned, is because last week it  became obvious that the Cabinet just doesn't know what to do over the state of the Budget. There are some  people who are saying there needs to be expenditure restraint. There are others who are saying spend, spend,  spend to try to buy the next election. Well, the truth is, we do need expenditure restraint but at least as much  as that, we need a clear plan to grow our economy and we will never get that under Labor. Labor is addicted  to taxing, they're addicted to spending and they're addicted to regulating. That's why economic growth per  head has been so sluggish under this Government; that's why jobs growth has been so sluggish under this  Government. We've had jobs growth at 1.5 per cent and less under this Government, whereas we had jobs

5



growth well over two per cent under the Coalition; and that's why I'm confident that the next Coalition  government can create at least a million new jobs within five years and two million new jobs within a  decade.

QUESTION:

There's expected to be hundreds of more millions of dollars for the car industry to be announced today. Do  you support that?

TONY ABBOTT:

The best thing we could do for the car industry today is announce that there will be no go-ahead with the  Fringe Benefits Tax changes which have stopped the industry dead in its tracks. I mean, ask yourself, what  has Mr Rudd actually done in the month he has been Prime Minister? The boats are still coming in record  numbers; the faceless men are in charge of the Labor Party as much today as ever; the carbon tax is still  driving up your power bills. The only thing that Mr Rudd has actually done as opposed to talked about since  becoming Prime Minister, is he has stopped the car industry dead in its tracks. Thousands of sales cancelled;  hundreds of jobs gone; hundreds of millions of dollars in destroyed wealth because of a decision that hadn't  been thought through, hadn't been consulted over and will end up slugging ordinary workers $1,400 a year.  Is it any wonder they're not buying cars?

QUESTION:

But do you support this extra money going into the industry?

TONY ABBOTT:

As I said, I support not going ahead with the $1.8 billion fringe benefits tax slug on the car industry. That's  what's slowing the car industry down right now. That's what's destroying jobs right now. That's what's  stopping sales right now.

QUESTION:

Cabinet is expected to sign off on Budget cuts today. How deep to you expect them to be and will it damage  the economy?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, as I said, it's one thing to have expenditure restraint, that's important, but when you look at this  Government, every time they tell you they're saving money they're actually just increasing taxes. For  instance when they said they were saving money to fund the bring-forward of a floating carbon tax, it turned  out that the biggest element was this increase in tax on people with employer provided motor cars. Now, this  is a Government which hits you with a tax and says that it's saved money. Wrong. This is a Government  which is always looking for new ways to slug the Australian people.

QUESTION:

[inaudible] numbers on what your paid parental leave scheme will cost business and productivity - your paid  parental leave scheme - what impact that will have on business and productivity?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, our paid parental leave will be good for productivity, good for participation and good for population.  As any economist will tell you, the secret to strong economic growth, the ingredients of strong economic

6



growth are higher participation, higher productivity and over time, higher population. So our paid parental  leave scheme is good for everything. Our paid parental leave scheme will leave the families of Australia  substantially better off. Our hope is that we can introduce it at the same time as a commensurate company  tax cut. So no business will be paying higher costs and many businesses will be very, very significantly  better off. So our paid parental leave scheme is good for families and good for business and we will be  announcing the details in the lead-up to the election.

QUESTION:

Does the timing of it being implemented depend on the state of the economy that you inherit or will this be a  solid first-term commitment? The implementation, not just the announcement, or the framework being put in  place?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I want to make two points. The first point is that I am very committed to this. This will be, I hope, one  of the signature policies of an incoming Coalition government, so I'm very, very committed to this. Second  point I make is that a properly designed paid parental leave scheme will be good for business and good for  families. If it's good for business and good for families, it’s good for our economy.

Thank you.
