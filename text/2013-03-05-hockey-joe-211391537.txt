E&OE………………………………………………………………………………… JOE HOCKEY:

I am very pleased to be here with Martin Zaiter - the Liberal candidate for Parramatta. This feels like  my 351 Westfield that I have walked through over the years. The reception is very strong. I think it  is hugely important in politics to engage directly with the community and hear the unfiltered word of

the voters - not to be afraid of criticism, but also to be prepared to engage directly with people to  find out what they are thinking, whether they are happy or whether they are not happy. There is no  benefit in stage-managing it because all it does is it wraps you in a cocoon and keeps you away from

the concerns and the aspirations of everyday Australians. This is a regular event for me and also for  our candidates right across Australia.

There are a few things I would like to touch on - Australians are prepared to do what it takes to have  a government that is consistent and predictable - a government that is reliable and trustworthy, rather  than a Government that is engaged in chaos and a Government that is fake. Julia Gillard’s trip to  Western Sydney is fake, but she is making enormous promises without any accountability. If the  Coalition had made a promise yesterday to spend billions of dollars without putting a figure on it, or  saying where the money was coming from or identifying precisely where it was going to go then,  rightly, you would have a shot at us. From our perspective, we have been very upfront with the  Australian people about what we can afford and what we are going to promise and what we are  going to deliver. Julia Gillard’s trip to Western Sydney is running at about $1 billion a day, and the  Australian people and the people of Western Sydney are very cynical about, and understandably so.  It is not good enough to discover a part of the Australian community on the threshold of the election  or during an election campaign. You have to do it, you have to live and breathe it when there are no  cameras around. You have to do it, live it and breathe it when people might be heavily critical of  you, and not just when they pat you on the back. So this is part of what we do, to suggest that there is  no campaign on at the moment is disingenuous and I would say to you that I think people all over  Australia and, particularly in Western Sydney, just want to get on with their lives. They want to get  on with their lives, they want to be able to get on with raising their children, building their small  businesses, they just want to get on with it and they don’t want political interference.

JOURNALIST:

Can you just clarify whether or not the Coalition would wind back carbon tax compensation  measures if the Coalition is elected?

JOE HOCKEY:

Let me be very clear, if there is no carbon tax then there is no need for compensation. If you don’t  have a carbon tax then you don’t have injury. By its very design the carbon tax is meant to cause  injury. It is meant to change behaviour and that is why the Government compensates. What we have

said is that families will be better off under the Coalition. They won’t have a carbon tax and there  will be payments to families in the form of welfare payments and there will be tax cuts based on the  tax levels without the carbon tax package.

JOURNALIST:

[inaudible]

JOE HOCKEY:

We have said that.

JOURNALIST:

What about specifics like the tripling of the tax free threshold, will that stay?

JOE HOCKEY:

Martin and I were just talking about the tax free threshold. Martin is an accountant here in  Parramatta. So, Martin, what do you think about this argument about the tripling of the tax free  threshold?

MARTIN ZAITER:

A family with a single income earning $80,000 is $3 better off under the changes to the rules. The  one thing that, conveniently, the Government has not  told the people of Australia is that under their  rules they have actually cut the Low Income Tax Offset by over $1,000 and they have also increased  the marginal tax rates for those income earners between $6,000 and $80,000. Their talk about  tripling the tax free threshold - they need to tell the Australian people the whole truth.

JOURNALIST:

[inaudible] You are now promising tax cuts and pension increases in the first term of an Abbott  Government. How much and how will you pay for that?

JOE HOCKEY:

Quite obviously we are waiting to see the state of the books. I am not going to make commitments  that we cannot pay for, I am not going to make commitments, we are not going to make promises  that are based on assumptions about the state of the books at this moment when, from what we have  learnt, the books, as stated at this moment, are dead wrong - by Wayne Swan’s own words. I don’t  trust the Budget numbers. I will only trust the Pre-Election Fiscal Outlook which are the numbers  released by the Secretary of the Treasury before the election. That is why we are going to wait. Can I  tell you? Coming from a business background, you would not make a bid for a business without

seeing the books of the business. If the owner of the business had got every number wrong for the  last five years, then I tell you what, you wouldn’t be putting in an unconditional offer for the  business.

JOURNALIST:

But you have made a big mistake, you just promised to increase the benefit for families. So taxes  will be lower, compensation payments will be higher.

JOE HOCKEY:

From outside of the carbon tax package - outside of the carbon tax package - we have and we have

done that consistently.

JOURNALIST:

With that revenue stream gone…[inaudible] well, where is that money coming from? Savings?

JOE HOCKEY:

Yes. Absolutely, savings. The reason why is that it is not hard to abolish taxes that are hardly raising  any money - like the mining tax. The carbon tax is currently - the forecast revenue is based on a $29  a tonne estimate from Treasury and the European price is currently $6 a tonne, and as you know it  goes to the European system in 2015. Quite frankly, the Government is the one that has taxes that  aren’t raising money but has a massive amount of expenditure against those taxes. We have been  upfront, we have said we can’t afford to borrow money to spend it under the circumstances that  Labor has delivered in the mining tax and the carbon tax. It is unsustainable. We are going to have to  make the hard savings.

JOURNALIST:

[inaudible] There are comments in the paper from the leader, as reported, that seem to go to a  different place.

JOE HOCKEY:

No. They are exactly the same place.

JOURNALIST:

The tax-free threshold, raised to $18,200, what are you doing with that?

JOE HOCKEY:

You will see our scales before the election and we will get to see the books ten days into the  campaign. I am not going to make promises, I am sorry. I can’t look people in the eye here and make  promises that we cannot deliver. I will not do it. I won’t.

JOURNALIST:

We are trying to get into the detail of which …

JOE HOCKEY:

I am sure you are. You are trying to get me to make promises based on information that is simply not  available to you or me at the moment.

JOURNALIST:

What about the co-contribution to superannuation for lower income workers?

JOE HOCKEY:

We have said, repeatedly, it is one of the initiatives that we cannot afford because it is based on the  proceeds of the mining tax and the mining tax has been a complete failure. Now the Government is  borrowing money to pay those things. It is unsustainable. You can’t hand out money that is being  borrowed from the next generation. It is not what people want.

JOURNALIST:

[inaudible] It is part of the compensation package for the carbon tax. You have said you [inaudible].

JOE HOCKEY:

You will see our final tax proposal after we see the books ten days into the election campaign.

JOURNALIST:

[Inaudible]

JOE HOCKEY:

No. I am not going to play word games.

JOURNALIST:

Do you agree with Scott Morrison’s protocols he wants to put in place for asylum seekers? Has he  taken these to Shadow Cabinet? Or is he just freelancing?

JOE HOCKEY:

I saw that question asked on Q&A last night. Frankly, the bottom line here is I think Australians  need to know where people are located if they are unable to work. The thing that upsets me most  about what has happened with asylum seekers is they are being cast into the community without a  right to work. Therefore they are being put onto welfare without any opportunity to get out of it. The  living conditions are worse than what we, as Australians, would tolerate. Therefore, how can Labor  live with itself? At least with our Temporary Protection Visas people had the opportunity to work.

JOURNALIST:

Do you think the Government should be informed?

JOE HOCKEY:

Of course the Government should be informed.

JORUNALIST:

But does it go beyond that?

JOE HOCKEY:

The Government should know where people are in those sorts of situations.

JOURNALIST:

Should local residents? Should the police?

JOE HOCKEY:

Well that is an issue for debate.

JOURNALIST:

What is your personal view?

JOE HOCKEY:

My personal view in this instance doesn’t matter. What matters is that…

JOURNALIST:

You have been critical of Scott Morrison in the past for…[inaudible]

JOE HOCKEY:

I am not setting out to be critical of Scott Morrison. I am setting out to be critical of the Government.  The Government is the one - over 17,000 people came on boats last year.

JOURNALIST:

But if there was a boat, would you support…

JOE HOCKEY:

We are not going to get into this. I make one point, which I made in there about 457 visas. Julia  Gillard says people on 457 visas are taking the jobs of everyday Australians. Aren’t there people in  her office on 457 visas? How did they get security clearance to access some of the most sensitive  documents of Australia?

JOURNALIST:

Do you think they should have access?

JOE HOCKEY:

I am just surprised that there is no one else that is prepared to work in Julia Gillard’s office other  than someone who is on a 457 visa?

JOURNALIST:

Do you think a 457 visa holder should not have access to a security clearance?

JOE HOCKEY:

I am surprised. I seem to recall that under the previous Government people on 457 visas were not  allowed into ministerial offices, but I might be wrong.

JOURNALIST:

Can you confirm that you are going to remove the Schoolkids Bonus? That is still on the cards?

JOE HOCKEY:

Absolutely.

JOURNALIST:

But families are not going to be worse off. So what are you offering families as compensation for  removing that?

JOE HOCKEY:

We are getting rid of the carbon tax. We are getting rid of the carbon tax and that will reduce  electricity bills.

JOURNALIST:

But they get overcompensated for the carbon tax.

Page 5 of 8 Doorstop - Parramatta | Media | The Hon. Joe Hockey MP

3/09/2013 http://www.joehockey.com/media/transcripts/details.aspx?s=439

JOE HOCKEY:

Not every family gets overcompensated. There are a vast number of families that don’t. Small  businesses don’t. Your cameras bore witness to my discussion with small-businesspeople who were  greatly concerned. As the guy from Wentworthville BP said the cost of gas has dramatically  increased; refrigerant and LPG - the stuff that goes into a lot of the cabs around Sydney. That has  increased dramatically after the introduction of the carbon tax.  It flows through.

JOURNALIST:

So they will dramatically come down if you make Government?

JOE HOCKEY:

Of course…We are in the business of removing taxes - we are the only ones. We are saying the  carbon tax and the mining tax are going.

JOURNALIST:

We’ve just had this summer. We have had reports about this being linked back to climate change, as  you know. The carbon tax has had an effect on reducing emissions in Australia. Can you…?  [inaudible]

JOE HOCKEY:

I don’t necessarily buy that the carbon taxes has reduced emissions. [Inaudible] Emissions are down  primarily because industrial output was not what was expected to be the case. Look at China.  China’s usage of coal is going to dramatically increase over the next 30 to 40 years. Because its coal  use is going to increase obviously its emissions are going to increase. As it is, Australia’s emissions  - even with the carbon tax - are going to increase. My concern is with manufacturers. As I illustrated  at a CEDA speech last week in Brisbane; I gave the numbers on a manufacturer - $40 million energy  bill and he has got a $12 million carbon tax bill on top of that. He is competing with manufacturing  jobs in the United States where there is no carbon tax. Frankly, I care about the jobs of people, here,  on this street, and their jobs come out of manufacturing, they come out of a range of different areas.

If you make it harder for employers you make it harder for these people to have job security.  Therefore they don’t have the confidence to walk into that shopping centre and spend money  because they are always worried about the bills they are going to face tomorrow.

JOURNALIST:

[inaudible]

JOE HOCKEY:

Yes I am campaigning - I am not going to pretend otherwise.

JOURNALIST:

You are not governing yet?

JOE HOCKEY:

If they want to give us a chance to govern we will, but we don’t govern from opposition.

JOURNALIST:

Joe, there is a population conference taking place in Melbourne and one of the speakers is suggesting  that first home buyers should be given land for free so they can just spend money on building the  house and then buy that land 10 years later. What do you make of that?

JOE HOCKEY:

It comes as a cost. Whose land are they giving away for free?

JOURNALIST:

Well it’s up to the Federal Government to give away that land to first home buyers.

JOE HOCKEY:

Where does the Federal Government get the land from? That’s a good question isn’t it? You have go  to take some land off someone to give it free to some else and then you have got to pay  compensation. I would love to be Father Christmas but I’m not. Instead I think Australians know we  have got to live within out means.

JOURNALIST:

Just on that funding announcement today; are you concerned about the conditions being imposed in  terms of having to negotiate with unions?

JOE HOCKEY:

Firstly, it seems, as I said, to be a billion dollar announcement every day so clearly the Government  has given up on living within its means and running a surplus. But if this is a reheat of a previous  announcement - it seems to be interesting that Mark Butler is suddenly the pinup boy of Julia  Gillard. I can’t help but think this has something to do with Mark Butler’s support for Julia Gillard’s  leadership rather than actually real concern for the interests of people in the aged care sector.

JOURNALIST:

When you say that protocols for asylum seekers is up for debate - are you saying Scott Morrison is  freelancing at the moment and this is not actually Coalition policy?

JOE HOCKEY:

Sorry, I missed part of it?

JOURNALIST:

When you are talking about the protocols Scott Morrison put forward last week you say it is up for  debate.

JOE HOCKEY:

No, I didn’t say that… The bottom line here is this; the government has an obligation to know where  people are located if they are coming to Australia by boat - if they are asylum seekers. The  Government has got an obligation to know where they are. The Government has a responsibility,  even a moral responsibility, to ensure that those people are not dumped into the community with no  capacity to work….

[inaudible]

JOE HOCKEY:

With no capacity to have a reasonable quality of life. You start to get behavioural issues when people  are just sitting around on welfare doing nothing with no hope of getting a job. That is when you get  your behavioural issues. That is when you get people engaging in crime - not necessarily, but it can  be the end outcome. That’s why I don’t think Scott Morrison’s comments were motivated by  anything other than genuine concern for the welfare of the broader community and genuine concern  for the welfare of the people seeking asylum. Thanks very much.
