TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER  GRIFFITH CANDIDATES DEBATE  ABC BRISBANE  6 AUGUST 2013





E & O E - PROOF ONLY  _____________________________________________________________



Subjects: Griffith Debate  _____________________________________________________________



HOST:                                               I’ll start with you Kevin Rudd, how will you

work cooperatively with the State Government to achieve the outcomes for this  seat of Griffith?

PM:                                                     Let me go to three examples because that’s

a very practical question and it should be.  People elect governments, they expect  Governments to work across party lines, for the  interests of the nation, the state and local  communities. Number one, let me give you an  example of DisabilityCare Australia. First  National Disability Insurance Scheme, where  the Australian Government, the Australian  Labor Government reached an agreement with  this Government here in Queensland under Mr  Newman. Number two, where we tried hard to  get an agreement has been on the Better  Schools Plan to invest millions of dollars extra  into each individual school in Queensland.



HOST:                                               Was that an example of working cooperating

or aggressively?

PM:                                                     No, we worked as hard as we could. I went

and sat down with Mr Newman, Bill Shorten

the Education Minister but we didn't get there.  So I think if our Government is returned we will  sit down again and try to deliver the best  outcome for our local schools. The very last  one, particularly frankly where we're knocking  our heads against the brick wall, which is on  the National Broadband Network. If you’re  talking to the residents of Brisbane southside,  what they want is every household and every  business premises to be connected to high  speed broadband. Our opponents, both State  and Federal, don't want that. We will just  proceed if elected but want that. If Mr Abbott is  elected it will be disconnected. So there are  some examples of trying to get it right where  you’ve got a fundamental difference, but also  acting on behalf of the local community  wherever we can.



HOST:                                               So you are going to try and lift the standard,

improve things? Because things have not been  terribly cooperative with the State Government  at the moment. In fact, you’ve been quite  aggressive in using them it would seem as a  political wedge in a federal sphere saying if you  elect Tony Abbott, he’s like Campbell Newman.  That doesn’t look like cooperation to me?



PM:                                                     There are few things I’ll just call basic facts.

Mr Newman was not elected with a mandate to  go and sack 14,000 people, including 4,400  health workers. That’s what happened. And  when Mr Abbott says he’s going  to have a $70  billion slash and burn against jobs, health and  education, it’s right for me to say that with Mr  Newman you get the entrÃÂ©e, with Mr Abbott  you get the main course. One follows from the  other. And if he’s going to say he’s not going to  have a $70 billion slash and burn I am all ears,  but his Treasury spokesman said he wasn’t  even going to put out a bottom line. I believe  this is being factual in response to a record of  behaviour.



HOST:                                                Tony Abbott told me yesterday when it

comes to the public service they will allow it to  downsize by natural attrition, there won't be  redundancies. He is very clear about there   won't be, is very clear about that.



PM:                                                     $70 billion which is the figure they have

used, we haven't invented this figure, they  have used it, so the question is where do the  cuts come? In terms of local issues, you talked  about before, if Mr Newman has said we're  going to privatise school ovals and we force  them to back down, if he says we're going to  force mergers and schools, and we force him  to back down that is acting for this local  community’s interests.



HOST:                                                Bill Glasson you’ve got a massive office on

Old Cleveland Rd at Coorparoo and people  have apparently been walking in to you, talking  to you about the local issues. What are they  telling you is of concern to them in the area of  Griffith?



BILL GLASSON:                             The main issues revolve around the

economy, the cost of living, the cost of doing  business, I suppose is the major issues that  they're talking about. At the end of the day, you  can talk about your NBN, you can talk about all  your health and education but unless you have  an economy to support it unless you’ve got the  income to support it, basically you can have all  the plans in the world, but you can’t deliver,  unless you continue to borrow on the credit  card. This is the trouble with the current  Federal Labor and Mr Rudd. He has our credit  card in his pocket and pulls it out just about  daily and puts more on the cards. But the  reality is at the moment we have a problem,  that we’ve got to address. I think the figure you  quoted yesterday Kevin was debt to GDP ratio  was 13.5%. Correct? I think that is the figure  you quoted. But if you take the debt across the  States as well, that is even higher. We're

getting up to 20-odd per cent debt to GDP  ratio.



HOST:                                               My question was the people of Griffith, the

people of Morningside, Cannon Hill and  Coorparoo. Are they really coming to you  saying I am worried about the debt to GDP  ratio or are they saying their worried about the  closure of Coorparoo Secondary College?



BILL GLASSON:                             No, they are worried about their business.  You have to get the fundamental economics  right before we can start to talk about providing  finances for whatever is planning to fund. The  reality is businesses are hurting. Businesses  have no confidence. They have no trust. That  is a key word. They have no trust in this current  Government to deliver. So the reality is we  have to restore confidence and restore trust  and business will then start to invest, start to  employ and actually start to drive our economy.





HOST:                                               Geoff, you are a businessman and have

written a book on business. Do you agree as a  member Greens and the candidate for the  Greens, do you agree that that is what people  are worried about in this seat of Griffith here  around the Colmslie, Cannon Hill, Morningside,  Bulimba those places?



GEOFF EBBS:                                Thanks Steve, the people in the street are

worried about things like refugees. That's been  absolutely the hottest issue that we have come  across in this campaign. We have got people  standing up and saying I voted Labor for years  and I am not going to vote anymore. I can't  stand this cruelty. Even though that is not a  local issue, it's a national issue, people really  care about it and get hot under the collar on  both sides. We have had people and yelling at  the Greens for look being pro-refugee and  looking for a humanitarian solution. So those  issues really, really matter to people. In terms  of the - the effect on businesses what a people  are looking for is an expansionary view of what

the future should look like. The Greens are  saying the future is green, we need renewable  resources, we need to deal with the challenge  of fossil fuels and climate change, and we  need to create a long-term infrastructure. And  that needs to happen here in Griffith and  everywhere else.

HOST:                                               So these are the issues that locals are

raising with you, knowing you are the candidate for the seat of Griffith?



GEOFF EBBS:                                 We have a lot of green businesses in Griffith.

We have solar energy companies, who are  struggling under the changes to rebates, we  have people who are running Internet  businesses who need more support to get that  happening, and do you know that only 30 per  cent of businesses in Brisbane actually  transact online. So we're falling behind the  world in terms of our Internet business model.



HOST:                                               Karen Hunter, from the Palmer United Party,

what are the locals tell you when they find out  you're a local candidate for the seat of Griffith,  are they saying the same thing they are saying  to the other candidates?





KAREN HUNTER:                          When I walk the streets of Griffith I have to  say one of the things I hear the most is the fact  that businesses are suffering and they're  suffering because a lot of them can't employ  the staff they want to employ, they have to  work long hours themselves, seven days a  week, there's been a drop off in business and  they say it's all down to the inflexibility of the  Fair Work Act, which I can understand as a  small business owner myself. And what I would  like to see and what they have said to me and I  am only taking on what they have said is they  would like to see a reduction in taxes, that is a  reduction in company taxes which of course we  are going to look at. And a reduction in taxes  rite across the board. For example, with a  second job now if someone has a second job

and in this climate where you have so many  restrictions for the small businesses when they  employ people on weekends, there are a lot of  people who can't get a full-time job, they may  only work two hours in one job and maybe,  say, three hours in another job and it's very  hard when you have to actually juggle both  jobs as one of my sons did.



HOST:                                               So there's an underemployment problem in

the South-East Griffith?

KAREN HUNTER:                          Not necessarily, it's more or less to do with  the fact that businesses cannot afford to  employ people under the current Fair Work Act  with all the stringent policies and rules that are  engaged in there. So what I would like to see  is, first of all, that we continue to cut the red  tape as this government has not done, all they  have done is the reverse. We want to also give  businesses confidence, which means that the  more confidence they have the better they will  do and the more staff they will be able to  employ. Without a business that is profitable,  you don't have any jobs and therefore you  don't have any money to spend in the  economy.



HOST:                                               This is 612 ABC Brisbane, it's 16 minutes to

nine. Just some breaking news the State  Government MP Peter Dowling will stand aside  from his committee roles as the chair of the  ethics committee in Parliament while  allegations raised by a former mistress of  alleged misconduct are investigated. The MP,  the member for Redland in Brisbane, has  apologised to his family for the "shame and  embarrassment", that has come from  revelations about alleged from revelations  activities in his ministerial office in Parliament.  You will hear more from that report on State  politics from Melinda Howells in ABC news at  10am this morning. But State MP Peter  Dowling has just stood aside from his  committee roles. We have just had a number of  questions emailed in. Bill Glasson and Kevin

Rudd, have you ever shared a meal together  privately?



PM:                                                     I don't think we have. And Bill received an

order of Australia recently. I wrote him a letter  as PM, congratulating him and saying well  done as a doctor and as a person who has  always been passionate about the medical  profession.



HOST:                                                Bill?



BILL GLASSON:                             We haven't had a dinner. I received my AO

with Kevin's signature on it and I value that AO  and I suppose the efforts that I have a passion  about indigenous health, a passion about  making.



PM:                                                     I hope you kept the letter as well, Bill?



HOST:                                               But you have not had a meal with Kevin

Rudd?

BILL GLASSON:                              No.



HOST:                                                Bill Glasson, do you support the recent

changes made by the Federal Government made around cigarettes, packaging  and taxation?

BILL GLASSON:                             Of course obviously as a doctor, as I said

earlier, I have a passion about it. My mother  died of lung cancer. I have patients of my dying  of various cancers directly related to smoking.  As you know, smoking is not only about lung  cancer but about any cancer you may be  subjected to, smoking increases your risk of,  so whatever we do to try to reduce the rate of  smoking, I would support.



HOST:                                               Is that a yes, you do support the Federal

Government's changes in this area?

BILL GLASSON:                             Steve, I do but can I say this was done in the

context of …. not as a health initiative. This

was done in the context of a budgetary deficit  problem. So I’d just like to say to the Federal  Labor Government, and particularly Kevin  Rudd, I think you need to sit down and work  out a plan in terms of taxation, where the tax is  going to come from, don't just attack the low  hanging fruit… like cigarettes and alcohol, but  you have a plan in terms of where the income  receipts will come from and obviously where…



PM:                                                     So you will repudiate the Liberal Party's

policy of taking campaign donations from tobacco companies?

BILL GLASSON:                             This has been asked a number of times in

the last 10 minutes..

HOST:                                               Will you?



BILL GLASSON:                             The reality is that the tobacco companies are  acting within their rights and if I was in the  party room, and I hope to be successful, I  would sort of be lobbying. I’ll be honest with  you, will be lobbying against it because I think  at the end of the day you have to be true to  your words.



HOST:                                               If you're elected the member for Griffith you

would in the party room of the Liberal Party, in  Canberra, fight against accepting, money,  political donations from companies directly or  indirectly connected with the production of  tobacco?



BILL GLASSON:                             Absolutely right.



PRIME MINSITER:                          We stopped this in 2004, 10 years ago. So is  Bill now calling on Tony Abbott today to stop  taking money from tobacco companies? It's the  here and now that counts.



HOST:                                               Thank you, PM



HOST:                                               Firstly of all, a general question. Who said

this, 'politics is about power, it's about power of the State, it's about the power of  the State as applied to individuals.

BILL GLASSON:                              I it was Kevin Rudd, wasn't it?



PM:                                                     Correct. Correct.



HOST:                                               Do you agree with that Geoff Ebbs?



PM:                                                     Hey, Steve, the aunty wouldn't be taking

anything out of context, would they?

HOSTP:                                              It's from the opening line of your maiden

speech to parliament.

PM:                                                    It goes on to say ‘Where the power

exercised for the many or the few. Why did the ABC cut that bit out?

HOST:                                                It haven't got to that. Keep going..



GEOFF EBBS:                                 The fact that it addresses power first and

foremost says a lot about the man who delivered the statement.

HOST:                                                You mean Kevin Rudd, the man to my

right?

GEOFF EBBS:                                  Yes. I do.



PM:                                                     So you don't think a debate about politics

should be used for the many or the few.

HOST:                                                 Please, Kevin. I'm the moderator, you're

the PM!

PM:                                                     And you misrepresented the quote.



HOST:                                               Geoff Ebb, would you like to continue on?



GEOFF EBBS:                                 Obviously when you stand for political office,

there is a certain amount of power involved.  But the issue of bad politics is about achieving  outcomes and so the politics has an element of  the art of compromise about it. It's about how  you work cooperatively to get the outcomes  that benefits you see are beneficial for the  people you represent.



HOST:                                               Karen, how does the statement by the man

to my right, sit with you?





KAREN HUNTER:                          Well, it depends how you take it. Quite frankly  I feel rather uncomfortable with. I feel that as  an individual, and as someone who has walked  around the streets of Griffith, trying to find out  from people what they need in the electorate, I  would consider   myself to be in fact a servant trying to provide  the services to the people of Griffith, as I would  try to do. We do all control our destiny, I know  that some people would think that politics is  about power but I don't think so really. I think  that politics is about what you can do for your  community, what you can do to help those in  need, the pensioners, the veterans, the people  who are sick, our schools, our hospitals, I think  it's all about doing something for them. And not  thinking about yourself.



HOST:                                               Now, Kevin Rudd - finish the statement if

you would.. It was a statement from the opening line of your maiden speech to  Parliament. Finish the line for me.

PM:                                                     I am more interested why the ABC chopped

it off. The full quote is politics is about power,  and the other things you just referenced and  whether power is exercised for the many or the  few. That is the core moral question of political  life. When you come to collection of three to -  300 million dollars’ worth Federal taxation  revenue in a given year, the decision of power  is to where that is allocated, who gets support  from that and who does not? Whether you  make a decision to fund the extra new  computers at Balmoral State high school or  take the Liberal Party's view that that is a  waste of money. Whether you take that power  of the State to provide school kids bonuses to  help people on the southside here to help with  their cost of living which the Liberal Party says  they will abolish, whether you use the power of  the State to provide Australia's first paid  parental leave scheme which thousands of  local families benefit from, whether you use the  power of the State to build Australia's first

National Disability Insurance Scheme, whether  you use the power of the State to lay out a  Better Schools Plan, which puts an extra $15  billion into our schools and whether you use  the power of the State and I think this is very  important before Bill goes to his next point, to  do this, to have a lower tax to GDP ratio than  existed under the Howard Government. And  that is what I believe you use the power of the  State is all about for the many or the few. We  are for the many.



HOST:                                               Bill Glasson, do you want to address this

point that politics about power in the context that Kevin Rudd has made the  statement?

BILL GLASSON:                             It's about power, but it’s also about the

individual and how they exercise that power. I  think that the ultimate power rests in the voter  and that will be exercised on 7 September. But  the reality is that the vast majority of people  that go into politics go in for right reason. With  that, given the privilege of power and making  some very important decisions on behalf of our  community and our society, there is a small  percentage whose only interest is in their own  position, in their position within the party or just  exercising that power across the government in  the broad broader sense. In part, I think Kevin  is correct but in part I think we have to bring it  back to as Karin and Jeff have said, ultimate  power rests with the voter and should do.



HOST:                                               Eight minutes to 10. This is 612 ABC

Brisbane. Steve Austin is my name,  broadcasting live in the Colmslie hotel with  some of the to the candidates of the seat of  Griffith. Karin Hunter, can you name three  suburbs in the seat of Griffith.



KAREN HUNTER:                          West End, South Brisbane and Annerley.

HOST:                                               Geoff Ebbs?



GEOFF EBBS:                                 I live in West End I will start at this end.

Morningside, Cannon Hill and Bulimba.



BILL GLSASON:                             I live in Hawthorne, but we go to Norman

Park, Camp Hill, Carina.

PM:                                                     That is your three.



HOST:                                                I assume you know them Kevin Rudd



PM:                                                     Not only do I know them. Therese and I

have door knocked 35,000 homes over the  years as well. We know most of the street, all  the cul-de-sacs and in fact most of the dogs.



HOST:                                               I interviewed Tony Abbott yesterday, the

Leader of the Opposition, and he revealed he  is still paying off his house mortgage. Are any  of you still paying off your mortgage?



GEOFF EBBS:                                 Yes, I still have a mortgage on my family

home.

KAREN HUNTER:                          Yes, I am paying off my mortgage on my  family home.

HOST:                                               Geoff Ebbs from the Greens and Karin

Hunter. So you're still both mortgage holders. Kevin Rudd?

PM:                                                     Our house here in Norman Park, I paid off

the mortgage when I ceased being a State  Government employee, cashed in the super  that I had at the time and we paid off that  mortgage. We have a mortgage on our place in  Sunshine Beach and one in Canberra.



HOST:                                               Bill Glasson?



BILL GLASSON:                             I am in a lucky that I have paid off my

mortgage but what I'm concerned about is the  mortgages for my children and my  grandchildren. I do wonder whether they will be  able to take one out let alone pay one off.



HOST:                                               Kevin Rudd, another question to you -Bill,

interest rates now, if you are on an average  mortgage of $300,000 a year, you are now  paying $5,500 a year less than you were when

Mr Howard. You don't have to add to that if you  don’t want to?



PM:                                                     It’s just a fact, we either have facts or fiction

in this debate.

HOST:                                                We are also racing against the clock. So I

need to get a couple more in from the audience. Did you want to address that Bill  Glasson?

BILL GLASSON:                             Of course, obviously interest rates are

coming down. You could argue that's because  the economy is getting weaker or stronger but  the reality is that the potential or the resilience  of us as an economy now to offset any future  global financial downturn is just about zero.  Our fiscal policy is limited. Our monetary policy  is limited we are in a precarious situation at the  moment that we cannot respond to any further  downturn in a very constructive way.



HOST:                                               I asked you at the opening of this discussion

Kevin Rudd about how you were going to  cooperate with the State. How are you going to  look after the parents of the 600-odd students  at Coorparoo Secondary College that would  have been able to send  them to Brisbane  State High until you opposed the move? Those  people would have seen the value of their  house rise because of the catchment for  Brisbane State High and their kids have the  option of a highly acclaimed state school. You  opposed this move. Coorparoo  has lost two  out of three enrolments in the past with their  five years. Parents with their feet and taking  their children elsewhere. What are you going to  do for them?

PM:                                                     I do whatever any local member of

Parliament does - they listen to community. I  went to the public meetings in the community. I  went to meetings at Coorparoo secondary  college. I didn't see Bill at the college, I listened  very closely to what the local P & C wanted for  the future of their college and they said they  wanted to keep their college. For you to infer in

the question that they would go to a high  quality school called Brisbane State school  inferring that Coorparoo Secondary College is  not of high quality is wrong and I will defend  that college until I die. Secondly, I went to the  public meetings of Brisbane State High and I  listened to what they said. There were  hundreds at both meetings and at Brisbane  State High, what did they say? They did they  did not want to merge, it wasn’t going to work  having a split campus. I went to Balmoral High  and Whites Hill College and asked them do  you want to see your school ovals privatised by  the Newman Government and they said, no.  And having listened to those four groups of  local communities in public meetings, I stood  up for them and as I stand up for my local  community and I will fight against any  government including the Liberal National  Party Government of Queensland to deliver for  the local community and that's what I have  done.



HOST:                                               Even though the enrolments of that school

have been dropping significantly and parenting  very voting with their feet and leaving  Coorparoo secondly college and taking their  children elsewhere?



PM:                                                     What I would say to that is if you look

across schools on the Southside the  enrolments go up and down: I have been a  member for 15 years. Norman Park State  School when I first came here had a couple of  hundred kids now has 400 or 500 kids. What  I'm saying is that schools change, depending  on the catchment area, what parents want at a  particular time, the principal at the time and,  therefore …



HOST:                                                And the enrolments at that college have

been going down.

HOST:                                               And you have to  do is listen to what the

local people have to say. I went to all the public  meetings and I said to them one thing,

whichever decision you take I will back and I  have done that in all four school cases. I don't  think you can ask more of a local member in  terms of listening to the local community.



HOST:                                               Bill Glasson?



BILL GLASSON:                             I could have raced off and sort of engaged in

the media and given myself bigger profile but  what I did I went to Aaron Dillaway and Mr  Kaye and I said to them about the oval  business that that's a bloody stupid idea. We  need more green space. We should stand up  for that area. If the school can't use it - I’m  talking about the Bulimba sportsground oval  and whites hill issue. On the school  amalgamation and this other issue, Mr Rudd  did you go and make an appointment to see  the Minister for education and say to him that  you were …  the concerns of the meetings you  attended? Did you make any contact at all with  the State government on this issue or did you  just go from Media event to media event and  try and I suppose just use I it as a way of  profiling you rather than profiling the issue?



PM:                                                     The bottom line here Bill is who delivered

the outcome here? The people did through  people power. I was acting in support of the  people and Campbell Newman’s Liberal  National Party Government backed down  because the political heat got too much for  them. Everyone in this community knows this.



BILL GLASSON:                             They backed down because Ian Kaye and  Aaron Dillaway and Bill Glasson were working behind the scenes.

PM:                                                     They know this because it characterises a

culture of privatisation under the Liberal National Party Government, which we  oppose.

HOST:                                               This is 612 ABC Brisbane. I have to wrap it

up in a moment. Bill Glasson some time ago  you roped in some marketing students from  QUT to knock off Kevin Rudd. How’s going?



BILL GLASSON:                             We're still working on it. September 7, there  will be a very important decision for the people  of Australia, but more importantly the people of  Griffith and I would like to say to them that I  think it's marketing or the reality is we need a  change in Griffith.



HOST:                                               Bill Glasson from the Liberal Party, Karin

Hunter from the Palmer United Party, Jeff ebbs  from the Greens and sitting member for Griffith  Kevin Rudd thank you to all of you.
