FAMILY INCOME SUPPLEMENT

The Labor Party's proposals for a family income supplement  were outlined in Sydney on 5 May by Bill Hayden and myself.

They are designed to improve the living standards of low "   income families with dependent children. The number of such  families increase as unemployment increases. More breadwinners  are being put out of work, more families are living on a

single wage, and more on pensions because there are so few jobs

The chief reason, apart from economic malaise and high  unemployment, why their situation has deteriorated is the  failure of the Fraser Government to increase family allowances  despite a 40Â° /o increase in inflation since they were introduced  in place of the tax rebate in August 1976.

Rather than increase family allowances across the board the  Labor Party would direct the money available to low wage and  pensioner families caring for dependent children.

It is intended to do this by introducing a family income  supplement to be paid on behalf of each child in families  whose joint income, that is the taxable income of the parents,  is below $14,000 a year.

As the table below makes clear, larger payments will be made  to families on lower incomes. Families whose joint income  is above $14,000 a year will receive only the present family  allowances.

The cost of paying the family income supplement, which, like  the family allowance, will be tax-free, is estimated at  $250 million a year.

The payments will be made, as with family allowances, to the  mother, or to the person caring for the child or children,  at the following rates: #  Family Income Rate

$0 - $8,000

$8,001 - $10,000  $10,001 - $12,000  $12,001 - $14,000

$4/week/child  $3/week/child  $2/week/child  $l/week/child

taxable

^Family income is thq/ income of both parents in a two-parent  household, one parent in a single-parent household. Family  allowance payments are included in income.

.  Each eligible family would be required to put in to the  Department of Social Security an annual income statement,  on the basis of which the income supplement for the next  year would be paid, monthly or three-monthly, as preferred.

The income statements of pensioners and beneficiaries are  available in Social Security. Low income families paying

2

tax will have their statement of taxable income. Other  low income families not paying tax will be able to obtain  a statement of earnings.

. Provision will be made for those whose economic situation  changes significantly (up or down) to arrange for the  adjustment of the income supplement payments.  .

. Each recipient of family allowance payments will be sent  notification of the scheme.

. Each mother of a new baby will receive, as now, an  application form for the income supplement.

. Television, radio, press and workplace campaigns will  ensure that the public is aware of the scheme.

. Additional help will be provided in the Department of  Social Security to explain the basis and method of  payments.

Our second proposal is to increase the mother1s/guardian’s  allowance paid to single parents, whose disposable income if  they are living only on widow’s pension or supporting parent’s  benefit is at a poverty level unaccceptable in our society.

The allowance,  presently paid at two rates,  $4 a week if all children are over 6, and $6 a week if one is below 6 or an invalid, will be raised to $8 a week and the differential removed.  We have calculated the cost of this measure at $26 million.

Each of these family payments - family allowance, family  income supplement and mother’s/guardian's allowance - will be  reviewed annually. Considerations of economic justice and  recognition of our responsibilities to all families will  decide which payments should be increased and at.what  intervals.

Our firm commitment is to improving the situation of all  families below or near the poverty line and ensure that they  do not again have their living standards cut by government  action or inaction.

The examples given here indicate how particular low income  families will benefit from the family income supplement.

One-income families on $l60 a week with three or four children  will, if unassisted, be below the poverty line next July. The  family income supplement will raise them above the poverty line.

Two-parent pensioner families with two or three children,  below  the poverty line next July, would be above the poverty line  with the addition of the family income supplement.

Single parent pensioner families with one child will be above  the poverty line for the first time if family income supplement  is introduced and the mother's/guardian's allowance raised.

Single parent pensioner families with two children will be  $10 a week better off, though still $4 below the poverty line.

3 .

A family with three children and a joint income below $8,000  a year will receive $624 more a year.

A family with three children and a joint income of $9,500  a year will receive $468 more a year.

A family with six children and a joint income below $8,000  a year will receive $1,348 more a year.

The family income supplement scheme is the most direct way  of getting money to all poor families, whose welfare will have  the highest priority under a future Labor Government.

FIRST REPORT OF THE NATIONAL CONSULTATIVE COUNCIL ON SOCIAL WELFARE

When Senator Guilfoyle closed down the Social Welfare Commission  in August 1976, she announced that in its place the Government  would establish a Social Welfare Research Centre at the University  of New South Wales, and a National Consultative Council on Social  Welfare.

Speed in plugging the gap left by the Social Welfare Commission  seems not to have rated highly. The Centre began in January 198ÃÂ.

The first report of the National Consultative Council went to  Parliament on 1 April 1980.

Before I comment on the recommendations in the report,  the  following should be noted.  The Minister received the report in  September 1979Â» but took six months to table it; Some information  was well out of date, e.g. the figure for Homeless Persons

spending is for June 1978, not June 1979. pf four questions on  income security put to the Council by the Minister, only  Questions 1, 2 and 4 get a mention. Question 3 has vanished.

Family Needs

The Council's Income Security Committee examined problems as  they affect families, identifying the families needing urgent  help:

"The evidence shows that taxpayers with children have fared  far worse in terms of growth in disposable income over the  past three years than those without children. To make no  decision to rectify this anomaly is, in itself, an important

decision."

"The Committee concentrated its attention on the need for  increased assistance for families with children. We found  the evidence for this to be overwhelming and have recommended  accordingly.  However,  on the latest computation of the poverty  line we have available,  all who rely on pensions and benefits

for their total income are either hovering on the poverty line  or are well below it."

They recommended indexation of all benefits affecting children;   a greater differential in payments for the fourth child; and  rejected any suggestion that family allowances be funded at the  expense of other pensioners and beneficiaries.

4 .

It is a pity that the Committe gave such sketchy reasons  for recommending the indexation of all allowances,  when their  concern is obviously for families near the poverty line.

Emergency Relief

The Council congratulated those responsible for the Joint Study  of Emergency Relief and stated several propositions:

. that income security is the responsibility of the Commonwealth  Government, and must include a system for the provision of  emergency relief; . that a three-year program should be developed with the States

and non-government agencies to provide emergency relief; .  that discretionary special benefits should be paid to  persons in need in times of emergency.

I make two comments. Firstly, there is a case for including  local government bodies among those eligible to receive and  dispense Commonwealth funded emergency relief. Secondly, many  organisations feel strongly that, as tough policies in the  Department of Social Security directly cause family deprivation  and need,  the Commonwealth and not voluntary agencies should

take full responsibility for dealing with emergency relief. As a consequence they are not applying for emergency relief  funds. Nevertheless,  applications have been received for three  times the amount of money that is available. .

Homeless Persons

The Council stated that:

"the Federal Government must accept responsibility for the  chaotic state of affairs which exists at the present time".

It is recommended that $5 million a year should be made  available for the next three years;  that the staff salaries  formula should be reviewed;  and that meal and accommodation  subsidies (250 and 75ÃÂ¦ per person per day) should be adjusted  in accordance with the C.P.I.

These are matters which we have constantly raised when  criticising the Fraser Government for spending only $6.6 million  of the $16.6 million allocated in fhe past four years.

Information and Consultation

The Council believes that:

"It should be a matter of concern to State and Federal  Governments that less than 50% of the community had a  reasonable knowledge of social welfare matters,  and the  ethnic groups and low income earners were the most  disadvantaged."

A survey conducted in Victoria found -.  those who receive a benefit or pension only knew the  details of that specific item and nothing else;

5.

. some were eligible for a benefit or pension but were  not aware of it;

.  the upper socio-economic group were fairly aware of the programs in operation but were not likely to need or use them.

Yet the Department of Social Security has dropped its publicity  allocation from $550,000 in 1976/7 to $500,000 in 1979/90 -  a drop of about 50% in real terms in spite of the greatly  increased number of social service claimants in the past

four years.

It is impossible to escape the conclusion that the Department  of Social Security is totally unconcerned that fewer than  50% of the community have a 'reasonable knowledge of the  social security system', particularly those who need it most.

Voluntary Youth Community Service Scheme

Along with almost all other welfare groups the Council  commented unfavourably on this scheme,  announced by the  Government in December 1978.

Its reservations centred on the lack of clarity of its  conceptual basis, its singling out only one section of the  large unemployed population, and the fact that there was no  overall social policy against which the scheme could be tested.  They also deplored the lack of adequate consultation.

The Government has not been deterred. Against advice from  the trade union movement and welfare organisations,  it has  re-named it the Voluntary Youth Project Scheme and begun  funding a few projects. It will be interesting to see whether  there will be any serious evaluation of the VYP Scheme and  whether that will be referred to the Council.

SOCIAL SECURITY'S NEGATIVE COMMITMENT TO HANDICAPPED EMPLOYMENT

I recently asked how many people with 80% incapacity, below the  invalid pension eligibility of 85%* had been placed by the CES  in the last year.

Senator Guilfoyle did not know because the CES does not classify  handicapped people in terms of percentage incapacity. She did  say, however,  that she expected access to the workforce by disabled  people to be a major issue in 198j., the International Year of  Disabled Persons.  She was quick to pass the buck:

"The details of any proposals in this regard will be a matter  for my colleague the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs."

She was realistic, for the handicapped cannot rely on the  Department of Social Security to employ them.

Senator Guilfoyle has admitted that her department employs only  6 paraplegics and 1 quadraplegic in a total staff of over 11,000,  in spite of its overall responsibility for handicapped programs.

Their 1979 legal opinion:

".. very few people are so handicapped as to be totally incapacit- Ã¢ÂÂ  ated for work:  the quadraplegic can often be trained to do something.

Not,  it seems, by Social Security, who have used this in a negative  way to keep people off invalid pension, when the positive approach  of training more handicapped to work in Social Security is needed.

.  APPEALS TO THE ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS TRIBUNAL - MARKING TIME  ________________________________________________________________________

As reported earlier, the Government stated on 21 March that  claimants, whose successful appeals had been overturned by the  Director-General of Social Services, could appeal to the  Administrative Appeals Tribunal from 1 April.

On 26 March I asked Senator Guilfoyle if she would notify eligible  claimants, whose appeals had been rejected in the past tliree years,  of the new system; whether continuing inequities would be acted on,  such as the refusal to pay unemployment beneficiaries during appeals;  and whether claimants would be paid while appealing to the A.A.T.

She replied that she would consider these matters, her standard  method of sweeping awkward questions under the carpet. Six weeks  later, five weeks after 1 April, no reply has come.

I am not surprised. On 1 April Senator Durack, the Attorney-  General, told Parliament that he expected no hearings for the  next few weeks, and the part-time members having 'special  qualifications' had not been appointed.

It was farcical of the Government to set an operational date when  nothing was ready. One wonders if they have any idea of the  misery and despair endured by people whose pensions and benefits  have been stopped, especially when it is prolonged by bureaucracy.

The only advance preparation has been the interim instructions  issued by Social Security in March on appeals going to the A.A.T.

"15.712 In view of this, it is important that:

. our working methods are based on the assumption that every  file processed may some day be critically examined in open  court (with the officers recommending and taking the particular  decision called on to explain and justify that decision).

.  all officers understand the importance of recording, while the facts are fresh in the mind, any statement made by clients  which could affect their eligibility. Care must be taken to  record what the client has said, rather than inferences that  may have been drawn from what he has said. No comment must  .  be recorded of a frivolous or irrelevant nature which would

not stand up well to later judicial examination.

.  all officers ensure that all decisions taken including the  reason therefore are clearly shown on the file papers together  with a copy, in all cases, of the advice forwarded to the  client notifying him of the refusal, termination, postponement,  reduction, etc. in pension or benefit payable to him and the  reasons therefore. The relevant provisions of the Act should  be specified."

The instructions are fair and sensible but raise questions about  previous working methods. ‘

Why was care not always taken to record what the client said, rather  than inferences drawn from what he said? Were comments previously  recorded of a frivolous or irrelevant nature which would not stand  up well to later judicial examinations?

It seems that files of claimants will now be kept with honesty and  sensitivity. It is certain this is being done, not to protect the  rights of pensioners and beneficiaries, but to defuse possible  criticism before the A.A.T. or in open court.

FROM THE HORSE'S MOUTH: LOW INCOME PEOPLE PUBLISH

Three new booklets make a special contribution to our underÂ­  standing of the problem of living on a low income.  Â·  Because  they were written for low income people by low income people  these booklets have a unique place in the growing body of  material written about poverty in Australia.

The Low Income People’s Survival Kit, the L.I.P. Policies  and the L.I.P. Campaign are published by the Action Resource  Centre (ARC) for low income families in Fitzroy,  Victoria. ARC is unique because it is an organisation run mainly by

families who use its services while being funded jointly by  the Brotherhood of St Laurence and the State Government.

The booklets are a cooperative effort by members and staff of the Centre. These people considered it time to formulate > their position and put it into, print.

The Survival Kit (selling fastest of the three at the launching)  is 100 pages of down to earth information on all the expected  topics - child care, housing, drugs,  family planning and the  law, for example - as well as golden rules for handling hire  purchase companies and field officers from the Department of  Social Security. The tone is straightforward and the emphasis

on people knowing and exercising their rights.

The other booklets make for more exciting and provocative  reading, especially for an outsider. They reflect a strong,  sometimes aggressive,  awareness that while policy makers are  middle class, low income people can and should define their

own needs. The policies booklet does this unequivocally,  covering a wide range of topics and using the format: What is  the problem, Why is it a problem, What are the short and long  term recommedations. The short term recommendations for  income security are closely related to the philosophies  expressed both in the recommendations of the Poverty Inquiry  and the Labor Party Platform. It is not possible here to do

justice to all the thinking that has gone into this policy  formulation and in any case people should read the booklet.

The L.I.P. Campaign records action taken against organisations  and naming names and cataloguing results.  The Gas and Fuel  Corporation, ACOSS,  the National Youth Conference,  the Brotherhood  of St Laurence, the Salvation Army, local politicians, social  workers in general and the media all come under attack for

aspects of their treatment of and attitudes to low income people.

It is refreshing and challenging to find people who are so  often silently on the receiving end of social policies speaking  up about what those policies should be. It is also to be  expected that in breaking silence they will sometimes overstate ,

the case. This should not detract from the vitally important  principle established by the publication of these booklets:  where poverty is concerned the real experts,  as Professor  Henderson would be the first to agree,  are not the professionals

but the people in there struggling to survive.

Highly recommended reading: "The Low Income Person's Survival Kit",  "The L.I.P. Policies", "The L.I.P. Campaign" (Available.Action &  Resource Centre (ARC), ll6 Fttzroy Street,  Vic.30^5Â· (03)^19 ^533Â·
