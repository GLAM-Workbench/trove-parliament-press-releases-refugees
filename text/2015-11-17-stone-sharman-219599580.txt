Shepparton Jewish Synagogue remembered

The somewhat clashing tones of the Aboriginal didgeridoo and a Jewish shofar ram’s horn  sounded together at the unveiling of a plaque near to the former site of Shepparton’s Jewish  Synagogue.

“This may have been a world first musical combination,” Federal Member for Murray  Sharman Stone observed.

“Some of Shepparton’s rich cultural history has been forgotten over time and it is fitting that  there is now a permanent reminder of the Jewish settler history in this region, and their early  fruit growing contributions, including the work towards establishing SPC.

‘The playing of the didgeridoo and shofar horn together was a way to remember that William  Cooper, the great local Aboriginal activist spoke out against the Nazis and their treatment of  the Jewish people in the 1930s.’

The synagogue was not used after 1966 and literally fell over in 1997-8. The Synagogue  was located near the corner of Doyles Road and Poplar Avenue in Orrvale. It had served up  to 60 Jewish families from 1913 to 1966.

The Jewish families had migrated in the early 1900’s as refugees, escaping organised  persecutions and massacres in Eastern Europe. By the 1960’s most of the Jewish fruit  growing families had resettled in St Kilda in Melbourne.

Two former Shepparton women, Shirley Randles and Ina Clive, who had regularly attended  the Synagogue in their youth, worked with local community representatives to organise a  dedication ceremony which took place on Sunday November 15, 2015.

“After the unveiling, the many descendants of the original Shepparton Jewish families, from  Melbourne and interstate and local dignitaries attended St Paul’s Lutheran Church African  House for more speeches and reminisces,” Sharman Stone said.
