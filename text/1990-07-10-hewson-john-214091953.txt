TRANSCRIPT OF DR JOHN HEWSON ON "PM" - ABC RADIO  TUESDAY 10 JULY 1990

MURPHYl  Opposition leader Dr John Hewson warned today that military  spending in Asia is expanding dangerously.

Dr Hewson called for a package arrangement to resolve the  Cambodian conflict, rehabilitate China and settle the dilema of  the Indo-Chinese refugees.  Graham Dobell reports that Dr Hewson  was speaking to the Foreign Correspondents Association in

Singapore on the the sixth leg of an eight nation Asian tour.

DOBELL:

Dr Hewson says the strategic trend in Asia was going against that  in Europe. The level of Soviet military forces in North Asia  might have reduced in quantity but not in effectiveness or strike  power. The United States wanted to retain a significant military

presence in Asia but the Opposition Leader said the largest US  bases in the Philippines were under real threat. The talk in  Manila was about terminating the bases, not merely reducing their  size.

HEWSONi

It seems that termination is now on the agenda for the five to  ten year horizon. The Philippines seem intent in their current  negotiations with the US and have set a firm timetable for US  withdrawal and not a US phase down.

I think it is also true to say that most of regional countries  favour a continuing US security presence. We certainly do, from  the Australian point of view. And the question is where and how  that presence will be based.

DOBELL ÃÂ

Dr Hewson said that a clear linkage was emerging between a number  of Asian issues. The Cambodian conflict, refugees and

rehabilitation of China. He called for a package arrangement  linking such elements. Without a package approach individual  nations would seek to do separate bi-lateral deals with China and  Vietnam which could upset long-term regional stability.

HEWSON:

The refugee issue can only ultimately be settled, to nty mind, if  the Cambodian conflict is resolved and if economic conditions  in Vietnam improve. Foreign aid to Vietnam will only be

restored fully when a Cambodian peace settlement is agreed.  China, again, has a crucial role to play but must be pressured  effectively with real incentives and penalties, I believe if that  is to work.

HEWSON CONT...

Now US involvement is essential but the rewards for the risks it  needs to take must also be apparent.  So in these areas the scope  for levage at the present time is probably greater than it has  ever been. China is seeking ways to restore its access to trade  credits and technology at international standing. The Khmer  Rouge are dependent on China's military supplies, with the

Soviets significantly winding back their assistance and support  of Vietnam.

And Vietnam is in dire need of economic assistance which could  be linked to a return of refugees.  The US and other Western  countries are central to facilitating the aid necessary in IndoÂ­ china to underwrite a settlement.  And the US have indicated that

it is willing to be involved in overseeing such a settlement.

DOBELL

The Opposition Leader said that the vital question in Cambodia  was whether the Khmer Rouge still wanted a military solution and  in line with his package approach Dr Hewson said a Cambodian  solution had to be seen in terms of China's future role in the

region.

HEWSON$

Clearly China can influence the Khmer Rouge to accept the  settlement in a way that no other country can. And the United  Nations Permanent Five meeting this week in Paris will hopefully  see some perhaps carrot and stick approach in encouraging a  constructive role by China in relation to Cambodia.

There's also the issue of China's role in the region which is  also changing quite rapidly, Indonesia and China have recently  thawed their frozen diplomatic relationship and the press is  carrying reports that Singapore will follow suit in due course.

Thailand is clearly keen to pursue an extensive economic contact  with China.  And if we believe press reports, japan is currently  putting the case to the G7 in Houston for the easing of

international trade and financial restrictions on China.

How china is rehabilitated into the international community and  who leads that process could again have vital implications for  our region's security outlook.
