MCMULLAN: Australian motorists, when they travel at Christmas, will continue  to  be  at  risk  of  damage  to  their  motors,  reduced  performance  of  their  cars  and   potentially increased costs because of the Government’s continuing refusal to act to  set a cap on the percentage of ethanol on petrol.

The Government has been warned for more than two years that it should act to set  a  10  per  cent  cap  on  ethanol.   Environment  Australia  told  the  Government  in   November 2000 that they should set a cap, and they have continually refused.  This  Christmas,  as  every  motorist  runs  the  risk  of  increased  damage  to  their  engine   because  they  don’t  know  if  their  cars  have  excessive  ethanol,  they  can  all  thank   John Howard, and John Howard alone, for his deliberate intransigence in refusing  to act on this matter.  It typifies the 2002 performance of the Howard Government.   They  failed  to  act  on  domestic  issues.   They  put  vested  interests  and  special   interests  ahead  of  the  interests  of  ordinary  Australians,  and  they  try  to  pass  the   buck to somebody else when problems get to a critical level.  It is a dereliction of  duty  by  the  Government  -  they  put  the  interests  of  their  mates  ahead  of  the   interests of motorists.

JOURNALIST: When you say this a matter that affects every motorist, that’s not  quite right is it?  I mean, they have released this data now that says that 85 per  cent of samples with ethanol come from New South Wales, so this essentially a New  South Wales issue isn’t it?

MCMULLAN: It is predominantly in New South Wales, although we don’t know  for  sure.  And  there  is  legitimate  use  of  ethanol  in  some  service  stations  in  New   South Wales and elsewhere where people know what they are buying and there is a  proper limit on how much ethanol is in the petrol; and those are perfectly legitimate  operations.  But a lot of people travel interstate at Christmas, and a lot of people  travel  and  buy  petrol  from  places  from  which  they  don’t  usually  buy  it,  and  they   could get some unpleasant surprises over Christmas.

JOURNALIST:  Have  you  spoken  to  the  New  South  Wales  Fair  Trading  Minister   about  why  he  hasn’t  yet  made  labelling  compulsory  while  we  wait  for  a  decision   from the Federal Government?

MCMULLAN:  Well,  all  the  states  have  made  it  clear,  and  New  South  Wales  in   particular, that this will best be dealt with by a national standard. And the Federal  Government  has  had  more  than  ample  time  to  act.   Joe  Hockey,  as  Minister   responsible  for  Consumer  Affairs,  in  March  2001  said  that  consumers  have  got  a   right  to  know  what  they  are  buying  when  they  buy  petrol  and  referred  it  to  the   ACCC,  who  responded  promptly,  and  the  Government  has  done  nothing.   They   knew 21 months ago that they had the capacity to act and the responsibility to act.   21  months  ago  Joe  Hockey  acknowledged  the  Federal  Government  knew  they   should act and had the responsibility and the power to act and they failed to do so.   Now  they  are  embarrassed  -  they  are  trying  to  pass  the  buck  to  the  States.   But   fuel standards is a Commonwealth responsibility.



JOURNALIST:  Is  there  any  practical  reason  why  the  States  cannot  ask  that   petrol stations label it?

MCMULLAN: The States can fill in the gap; it is a second best measure. But it is  the Commonwealth’s responsibility.  The failure to act is the Howard Government’s  failure and it is not a failure of omission, it is a deliberate continuing refusal to act.



JOURNALIST:  Have  you  actually  spoken  to  Bob  Debus,  the  relevant  minister,   requesting him to do so?  I mean that would surely be a step in the right direction?

MCMULLAN:  I  have  spoken  to  some  state  ministers  and  I  think,  in  an   emergency, they are probably all prepared to fill the gap; but they all know that this  is best done nationally.  All the Commonwealth’s own agencies tell them this is best  done nationally.  All the submissions to the Cabinet told them that they should act  and they have been doing so for two years. And the Howard Government has not  just  failed  to  act,  they  have  deliberately  decided  not  to  act.   They  have  made   conscious continuing decisions, including today, to refuse to act because they are  putting  vested  interests  ahead  of  the  national  interest  -  they  are  putting  mates   before motorists.

JOURNALIST: Why shouldn’t the consumers get the best of both worlds - get a  cap but also get labelling so they know what is in the petrol?

MCMULLAN:  They  should  get  both  and  the  Commonwealth  should  do  both.    The  ACCC  has  been  advising  the  Commonwealth  for  more  than  a  year  that  it   should set labelling requirements.  The Fuel Standards Act gives responsibility for  fuel standards to the Commonwealth.  They should both get a cap and get labelling.   Some ethical sales people in some States are producing E10 petrol where they tell  everybody that it has got ethanol in it and it has got a 10 per cent cap.  That is a  perfectly  legitimate  product  and  those  people  are  suffering  because  ethanol  is   getting a bad reputation because the Government won’t set a cap and won’t require  labelling.

JOURNALIST: What evidence that Labor have that the Government is putting the  interests of Manildra ahead of the interests of motorists?

MCMULLAN: Well, the outcome makes that clear.  The outcome makes it clear  that the Government is refusing to act and when you see the minutes of committee  decisions, the only body that is arguing against the 10 per cent limit are Manildra  and their representatives; and the Petroleum Institute has made it clear that they  were  told  by  at  least  one  minister  that  no  cap  could  be  set  because  the  Prime

3

Minister wouldn’t allow any decisions to be made that would have an adverse affect  on Manildra.  The evidence is mounting.  It is not just all the anecdotal evidence,  the minutes make it clear and the outcome makes it clear.



JOURNALIST: So is David Kemp lying when he says the information is vague and  conflicting?

MCMULLAN: Well, he is gilding the truth; but the fact is even if it is uncertain,  if a significant body of evidence says there is a risk at more than 10 per cent, the  proper responsibility for a government, to whom people look to protect them from  these risks, is to set the cap and then continue to review to see if it can be lifted  later.   You  don’t  say:  ‘we’ll  let  the  risk  continue  for  two  years  and  then  if  in  six   months time, 12 months time, we find that there should be a cap, we will impose  it’, and all that time people’s cars have been damaged, people are paying thousands  of dollars to have their cars repaired because of the impact of ethanol. And that is  all sheeted home to the Howard Government.

JOURNALIST: What would Labor’s response be if the Federal Government brings  in legislation to force the states to label?

MCMULLAN:  Well,  they  won’t  bring  in  laws  to  force  the  states  to  label.   What   they have said is they will bring in a law to give them the power to label.  I think  they  already  have  that  power,  but  if  they  don’t,  if  they  bring  in  a  law  to  give   themselves  the  power  to  do  it,  we  will  support  it.   It  is  our  policy.   We  have   announced our policy - there should be labelling of petrol containing ethanol.

JOURNALIST: Could the impact of ethanol actually be dangerous for motorists?

MCMULLAN:  It  is  not  dangerous  to  motorists.   There  is  some  risk  to  boat   owners, which is very serious at Christmas, and we have cited evidence months ago  from boat owning organisations of concern about stalling of two-stroke engines in  boats and some risk to boat safety which is very serious at Christmas.  But I don’t  want to be alarmist.  There is some evidence of that.  Dr Kemp refers to it in his  material today. But the principle concern, because most petrol is used by cars and  motorbikes, but to some extent there is a problem for boat owners as well and that  is very important at Christmas.



JOURNALIST:  Mr  McMullan,  today’s  Newspoll  has  Mr  Crean’s  dissatisfaction   rating  at  a  record  high.   How  concerned  are  you,  as  one  of  Labor’s  senior   strategists, that the voters, after 12 months as Opposition Leader, the voters have  marked down Simon Crean?



MCMULLAN: Let me make the first thing clear.  That poll says that the voting  intention at the end of the year is exactly the same as it was at the beginning of the  year.  For 12 months when you have all been writing about the Government having  had a magnificent year and a year of unsurpassed success, the two-party preferred  result at the end of the year is exactly where it was at the beginning.  So, if we had  had a good year, we would obviously be astronomically ahead.  Next year has to be  better than this year, but the focus has been too narrow, the media and highlight  attention  is  on  what  is  happening  internationally.   But  behind  all  that  fog  of  war   and  terrorism,  serious  issues  are  affecting  the lives of families at home, and they  are  seeing  it,  and  that  is  reflected  in  the  fact  that  the  voting  intention  is  staying   strong for the Labor Party.  Of course I would like to see it stronger, but we have

maintained our support this year through a very tough year, we have to do better  next year and get ahead.

JOURNALIST:  So  Simon  Crean  retains  your  confidence  as  Leader  and  will  lead   Labor to the next election?

MCMULLAN: Yes and yes.

JOURNALIST:  And  you  think  even  if  these  ratings  are  maintained  at  this  level,   that  doesn’t  suggest  there  is  going  to  be  a  move  against  him  at  some  time  in  the   New Year?

MCMULLAN: I expect Simon to lead us to the next election and I think the pre-conditions for us winning have been established - we have to be good enough in the  next 12 months to build on it.  But we had some hard decisions to make this year

about matters, particularly internal matters, not just the Party reform process but  the  asylum  seeker  policy.   And  having  both  of  those  behind  us,  they  are  very   important  to  the  Party,  they  were  necessary  things to do but they are not part of  communicating  more  broadly  on  issues  affecting  the  day-to-day  lives  of   Australians.  That is where our focus will be in the next 12 months and I think you  will  see  that  reflected  in  enhanced  support  for  Simon  and  the  Party.   But  it  is  a   challenge for us.  We have to be good enough to deliver.  The potential for us to do  significantly better is there.  The pre-conditions are there.  The base has been built,  but it is up to us to be good enough to deliver on it.
