Coalition’s $330 million Youth Employment Strategy dwarfs   Labor’s little idea

In what was supposed to be Labor’s year of ideas, the Labor party has failed to  develop any meaningful plan to tackle youth unemployment.

Assistant Minister for Employment Luke Hartsuyker said the Coalition’s Growing  Jobs and Small Business package announced in last night’s Budget services 15  times the people and provides 15 times the amount of funding Labor have  committed to tackling youth unemployment.

“The Abbott Government’s Youth Employment Strategy provides $330 million to help  young job seekers improve their chances of finding and keeping a job,” Mr  Hartsuyker said.

“In stark contrast, Labor has no plan to tackle youth unemployment.

“In the past 12 months they have had a couple of talk-fests and put a measly   $21 million on the table to help only 3,000 young people.

“Under the Coalition’s Youth Employment Strategy the Government is spending  $330 million to help around 45,000 young job seekers per annum to improve their job  prospects.

“The Abbott Government’s new Youth Employment Strategy includes:

Ã¯ÂÂ· $212 million for a new Youth Transition to Work Programme that will focus on  helping young job seekers to build the skills and confidence they need to  move into work;

Ã¯ÂÂ· $106 million for innovative programmes to help young job seekers at high risk  of unemployment such as those with a mental illness or young refugees and  migrants; and

Ã¯ÂÂ· $14 million to ensure early school leavers are engaged in study or work.

“Labor again showed yesterday that they lack a complete understanding of the  Budget, of sensible financial management and of the needs of young job seekers.

“Only the Coalition Government is committed to building a strong economy and  providing the necessary support to get job seekers off welfare and into work,”   Mr Hartsuyker said.
