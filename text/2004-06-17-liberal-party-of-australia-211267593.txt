Minister launches refugee kit at Bellevue Heights Primary School

Students and staff at Bellevue Heights Primary School today (17 June) hosted the  launch of a new national schools resource kit on refugees.

I was pleased to join the Federal Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and  Indigenous Affairs, Amanda Vanstone, at the launch of A New Life for Refugees.

The kit confirms that the Australian Government is this year expected to resettle about  13,000 refugees and humanitarian entrants.

It also points out that Australia is one of the top three countries in the world that accepts  people in need of humanitarian resettlement.

The kit, which is being sent to primary schools across Australia, explains that Australia  chooses refugees largely on the advice of the United Nations High Commissioner for  Refugees.

The UNHCR is quoted stating that Australia is “one of the leading countries in the  resettlement of refugees from Africa” and that “Australia has developed excellent services  for resettled refugees over the past five decades”.

Bellevue Heights Primary School was selected for the launch largely because of its  support for overseas students, including refugees.

The school is one of five in Adelaide to offer the New Arrivals program which is a  dedicated program for students arriving in Australia from other countries.

The program offers smaller class sizes and specialist resources for the 107 students  currently taking part in the scheme at the school.  This includes about 30 students from  refugee families.

I congratulate school Principal, Michael Papps and his staff for providing an excellent  service for our culturally rich community and highly recommend the schools kit.
