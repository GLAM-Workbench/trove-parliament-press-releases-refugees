13 June 2011

KIERAN GILBERT: With me now from Adelaide I have Liberal MP Jamie Briggs. From  Melbourne, Labor frontbencher Richard Marles. Gentlemen, good to see you both.

Richard, first of all very clear warning there from Tony Maher. It's got to be around that ball  park of $1.5 billion compensation for that industry, the gassy coal mines, and if not there's  trouble. It's a difficult balancing act on this and particularly when you get the Greens across  the line. They've made their position very clear on this issue.

RICHARD MARLES: Well Tony Maher is vigorously representing his members and you  wouldn't expect him to do anything less than that.

One thing I absolutely agree with Tony Maher on is that it is possible to implement an  emissions trading scheme without hurting industry and the way in which you do that is by  making sure that there is appropriate industry assistance in place.

We've made it very clear that industry assistance will form a key part of the price we place on  carbon.

KIERAN GILBERT: So mine workers will not be some sort of trophy hunters, he's worried  that the Greens see the mine workers as he describes it as sort of trophy hunting?

RICHARD MARLES: Well mine workers are never going to be a trophy hunt for the Labor  Party and the Labor Party absolutely understands the importance of industry and the  importance of introducing a price on carbon, to do that in a way which is able to support  industry and to support the jobs of the present.

And that's of course why, when the carbon pollution reduction scheme was put up, there was  a very significant program of industry assistance which formed part of that.

Now I can tell you, in terms of my electorate in Geelong which has significant industry    based upon carbon, I have a keen interest in making sure that we have a robust program of  assistance for industry but the minister and the Government's made it very clear that that will  be a key part of this program, as we put it forward.

KIERAN GILBERT: Okay Jamie, on the other element of the compensation at the  weekend, the Government leaked details of the pension -the proposed pension increase, two  and a half per cent is around the ball park, $500 a year for singles, $760 for couples.

Given the Coalition said it's going to wind back the compensation, are you concerned that's  going to be a difficult argument to prosecute, that you're going to be taking money essentially  away from pensioners and others?

JAMIE BRIGGS: Well first things first Kieran, let's actually see the detail of the carbon  price before we start seeing the detail of the so-called compensation.

I mean we're putting the cart very much before the horse when we're getting leaks out of the  government about what compensation there will be from a price we don't know what it is yet  or from a design we don't know how it will work.

And you've just seen Tony Maher from the CFMEU, the mining division of the CFMEU refer  to one of the most interesting aspects of the 2004 election which was of course where Mark  Latham tried to sell out the forestry workers in Tasmania, the CFMEU forestry workers  for  Bob Brown's preferences; very much what we're seeing now on a national scale and you've  just seen the reference made very explicitly by Tony Maher that if the Labor Party goes down  this path again of selling out their workers, which he is suggesting that they are then there  will be trouble with their mining workerss and so there should be trouble with their mining  workers.

KIERAN GILBERT: Jamie, what about the principle though — okay I'll get Richard to  respond to that in a moment — but on the issue of compensation, you're saying the detail's  not there but the Government's made it clear they're going to in some cases be  overcompensating, what about the political position that you'll then be in that you've got to  argue we're going to remove those pension rises, we're going to remove those tax cuts?

As this gets closer, are you worried that that is going to be simply no palatable?

JAMIE BRIGGS: Well let's see the detail. We haven't even seen the detail announcement  yet let alone the legislation and let alone the legislation getting to the parliament. And let  alone the parliament supporting what the Government puts up.

As far as we're aware, the Greens and the Labor Party haven't come to a deal yet. We know  that there will be a big split between the Greens and the Labor Party on the target, the five per  cent target by 2020, which is the Coalition and the Labor Party's target.

We know the Greens want a much high level than that so there'll have to be some sort of sell  off to get them into the ball park there.

Tony Windsor has made it very clear that he is yet to decide whether he will support the  legislation because he rightly hasn't seen the details and he rightly hasn't seen the  legislative  provisions which will be put to the parliament.

So before we can have a discussion about so-called compensation, we have to have a  discussion about what is actually in this, what is the carbon price and what will be the impact  on Australian families.

KIERAN GILBERT: All right but…

JAMIE BRIGGS: … what would be the impact on coal mine workers Richard Marles? You  tell us. What would be the impact on coal mine workers?

KIERAN GILBERT: Okay, let's — well let's go to Richard now. And Richard, I also want  to ask you about what Jamie, you know the point he made, that this is the CFMEU putting  you on notice because it clearly is. He is speaking out here because he's worried that the  Greens will carry the day in the Multi-Party Committee.

RICHARD MARLES: Well as I said, industry assistance will form a key part of the  proposition put forward around putting a price on carbon but I get a lot of enjoyment out of  listening to Jamie Briggs the friend of the Australian worker…

JAMIE BRIGGS: Not one, not one coal mine worker will go.

RICHARD MARLES: Jamie who is the friend of the Australian worker…

JAMIE BRIGGS: Absolutely.

RICHARD MARLES: … but I was very interested to read Chris Kenny's piece in The  Australian today which was suggesting that Jamie's among a number of coalition MPs  pushing for reform of industrial relations which is very interesting indeed.

But I think the point to understand is that industry assistance will form part of this  proposition. We've said that from day one. It did in terms of the Carbon Pollution Reduction  Scheme that was put forward in the last term of government…

KIERAN GILBERT: Okay…

RICHARD MARLES: But can I just also say in relation to the pensioners. We've made it  very clear that pensioners will be looked after…

JAMIE BRIGGS: What about coal mine workers?

RICHARD MARLES: They won't be worse off. Many will be better off. And you were  absolutely right Kieran when you put it to Jamie that, in saying you are going to scrap the  carbon price, you're also going to be scrapping all the benefits that then apply to pensioners,  middle income earners and low income earners.

KIERAN GILBERT: All right gents, we're going to have to take a quick break. We'll be  right back, stay with us.

[Commercial break]

KIERAN GILBERT: Welcome back to AM Agenda. With me this morning Richard Marles  and Jamie Briggs. We did — Richard before the break did touch on the issue of IR reform,  Jamie there's a piece in The Australian by Chris Kenny, a former senior adviser in the Liberal  Party urging Mr Abbott and suggesting there are MPs and you have been mentioned in the  past talking about the need to argue IR reform. Is the time now for Mr Abbott to grasp that  issue once again, to not be scared off by the Work Choices past?

JAMIE BRIGGS: Well look I think the piece refers to public comments that I've made, so I  don't think there's anything secret about what I've said in the past that the Gillard laws that  she implemented when she came to government are a building disaster for our economy.  They are going to put enormous pressure on wage base inflation, they — we're already seeing  what's happening up in Queensland with BHP workers striking before an offer has even been  made. We're seeing the wharfs again go back to the bad old days and we're seeing Qantas of  course have constant challenges and we hear out of Qantas that they are going to have a  massive challenge in the next few months.

And so there is — these laws have been like when we saw on the front page of The  Australian today, the ACTU planning a national campaign, another national campaign, and  you can't blame them because the Government, the Labour government, Richard's part of it  and he was part of the drafting of this no doubt and has offered sort of a valet service to the  union. This is, you know, the laws that they wanted, this is the intention of the law let's not  forget and so ultimately this is going to hurt the Australian economy. And Richard talks about  Australian workers, they're the ones who'll be hurt, those people trying to get access to a job,  they're not the people that the unions have ever been interested in. And so I've said publicly,  others have said publicly and we'll continue to push the case and why these laws are bad for  Australia.

KIERAN GILBERT: Richard there has been a fair bit of noise in this area, Qantas as Jamie  said, on the waterfront as well, why not take a close hard look at this in the way the Fair  Work Australia, the way that this broader legislation is working?

RICHARD MARLES: Well can I say it doesn't get any clearer than that and I thank Jamie  for his comments. What's very clear is that Work Choices is alive and well within the Liberal  Party room today…

JAMIE BRIGGS: No that's — Richard, don't be so immature, that is ridiculous.

RICHARD MARLES: That is absolutely clear…

JAMIE BRIGGS: That is absolutely ridiculous, that is so immature.

RICHARD MARLES: The Fair Work Act that we put in place has returned job security to  the Australian work place. It has been a key part of delivering an economy which is the envy  of the developed world as we all know. This assertion that somehow industrial disputes are  up is completely wrong. The Fair Work Act is playing its role. But what is really clear is you  can't kill Work Choices within the Liberal Party because it's part of the Liberal Party's DNA  that they want to strip entitlements for workers; I mean we stand for fairness in the  workplace, we stand for balance between employers and employees. The Liberal Party has

always been and is still about trying to remove entitlements for employees, and putting all the  power onto one side of the equation.

KIERAN GILBERT: Gentlemen I've got to…

JAMIE BRIGGS: But what is clearer — what is clearer — Kieran, what is clearer though is  exactly what John Faulkner just said last week is that all we have now in the modern Labor  Party are scripted MPs who just want to go on about their old scare campaigns. No one wants  to have any decent sort of discussion about a policy issue. They just want to go down a path  of raising good old fashioned scare campaigns and Richard's fallen for the trap. It's  disappointing, I thought Richard was better than that. But you know…

RICHARD MARLES: [Laughs]…

JAMIE BRIGGS: …it doesn't surprise me. It's sort of like break glass in case of emergency  inside the Prime Minister's office. Anytime they're in political crisis they reach for the old  WorkChoices bogeyman. Well of course you can have a discussion about the dangers of IR  reform.

KIERAN GILBERT: Okay…

RICHARD MARLES: [Indistinct] broke the glass, you're the one raising it.

KIERAN GILBERT: Gentlemen…

JAMIE BRIGGS: No, no, well we can have a discussion — Richard you can have a  discussion about IR reform without going down this…

RICHARD MARLES: And we have.

JAMIE BRIGGS: …sad Labor — sad, sad Labor Party bogeyman WorkChoices campaign  which is just really — you should…

RICHARD MARLES: We welcome your very frank views.

KIERAN GILBERT: Okay fellas, I've got to interrupt, I've got to interrupt, only one minute  left for this issue. Tony Abbott's in Nauru, Richard this shows the facility has been there and  it looks like it can be restarted pretty much next week he believes and a more humane option  than Malaysia. Why not relook at this?

RICHARD MARLES: Well this is a stunt, paid for by Liberal Party donors which we all  know is big tobacco.

JAMIE BRIGGS: Oh…

RICHARD MARLES: But look there are two issues here…

JAMIE BRIGGS: [Laughs]

RICHARD MARLES: …that the UNHCR have never been a fan of Nauru and we need to  bear that in mind and the other thing…

JAMIE BRIGGS: [Indistinct] Malaysia…

RICHARD MARLES: …is it simply doesn't break the model of people smugglers. The vast  majority of people who turned up in Nauru, ended up in Australia.

KIERAN GILBERT: No that's not exactly right, the vast majority of those…

JAMIE BRIGGS: Yeah.

KIERAN GILBERT: …di … well the majority of those deemed to be refugees, not the  majority that turned up because a large section were sent home Richard.

RICHARD MARLES: Well that's not right.

KIERAN GILBERT: That's — that's — that number's not exactly right there.

RICHARD MARLES: The vast majority of people who ended up in Nauru ended up in  Australia. It did not break the model of the people smugglers and that's the issue.

KIERAN GILBERT: Okay. All right, Jamie, we're almost out of time mate, 30 seconds, I've  got to go to an interview with John Anderson but just quickly.

JAMIE BRIGGS: Well look, what happened was people stopped getting on the boats, it's  cost effective, it's proven and they should adopt it. Malaysia of course, you know, we're going  down this Faulty Towers path of diplomacy that we're seeing at the moment with this

Malaysia solution. Just pick up the phone Prime Minister and do the right thing.

KIERAN GILBERT: Gentlemen, thanks for coming in on the public holiday, I hope you get  out for some golf this afternoon. I appreciate that.

JAMIE BRIGGS: Thank you.

RICHARD MARLES: Thank you.
