Competition  between  schools  for  students  coupled  with  per-student  funding  formulae  has  been

advocated  as  a  prime  way  to  improve  student  achievement  and  productivity,  and  to  improve

access to educational opportunities for students from low-income homes (Hoxby 2003a). Indeed,

Hoxby (2003b) has suggested that school choice could be “ a tide that lifts all boats”.

New  Zealand  has  been  of  particular  interest  in  discussions  of  the  effects  of  school  choice  and

competition,  because  it  has  had  a  decentralised  system  of  school  self-management  since  1989,

with  most  school  funding  based  on  student  numbers,  and  families  able  to  apply  to  any  state

school.  Previous  research  based  on  data  from  the  seven  to  eight  years  following  this  change

investigated  the  nature  of  competition  between  schools,  and  found  that  competition  failed  to

improve the educational opportunities or achievement of students from low-income areas (Fiske

and Ladd 2000, Lauder and Hughes 1999, Wylie 1998, Wylie 2000).

This paper has three objectives:

a) to update the New Zealand picture to see if earlier findings relating to the winners and losers of

decentralisation still hold in the light of national policy changes to school admission criteria and

the  introduction  of  balloting  for  oversubscribed  schools.  In  particular,  a  focus  is  given  to

questions related to equity of educational opportunity;

b)  to  investigate  the  uneven  operation  of  competition  in  New  Zealand  by  comparing  school

actions and changes over time for schools whose principals see themselves competing with other

local schools, and those whose principals do not see themselves in competition.

c)  to  situate  the  nature  of  school  competition  in  New  Zealand  schools  within  the  context  of

tensions with other policy directions, and tensions with parent and school expectations of parental

choice,  what  programmes  and  equipment  schools  should  provide,  and  school  self-management.

These tensions raise questions about the feasibility of school competition as a central policy tool

to improve education and educational outcomes.

The approach taken in this paper is largely pragmatic. Competition and family choice are not seen

as  having  universal  or  inherent  value  per  se,  either  positive  or  negative.  Their  value  (like  any

other  policy  tool)  emerges  in  relation  to  whether  they  can  maintain  and  improve  the  quality  of

educational experience and educational outcomes, and whether they can improve access to good

quality  educational  opportunities  for  students  from  disadvantaged  groups.  This  is  a  somewhat

different approach than the economic analysis of competition in structural terms, which takes for

granted  that  structural  competition  will  result  in  certain  behaviour.  Levacic  (2001)  provides  a

valuable  discussion  of  the  need  for  a  wider  understanding  of  the  reality  of  competition  and

competitive  behaviour  in  education,  based  on  behavioural  theory  of  the  firm,  and  the  school

effectiveness and improvement literature.

In an earlier review of the then available international research on systems of school choice (or

open enrolment) and vouchers, including New Zealand, I also found that the educational ‘market’

did not operate in the manner, or have the gains, that advocates of increased competition between

self-managing  schools  hoped;  where  it  operated  most  fairly  was  in  fact  in  small  systems  where

Page 2 of 28

there  was  some  partnership  between  schools  and  the  public  agency  responsible  for  funding  and

school support, and where there was considerable effort and money put into ensuring that family

choice  was  well  informed,  and  allocation  of  places  socially  fair.  Even  here,  achievement  gains

were  modest  rather  than  sizeable;  social  differences  remained  in  the  choices  made  by  low  and

middle  income  families;  informal  information  outweighed  official  information;  and  parents

remained  more  interested  in  what  seemed  to  them  reliable  (familiar)  provision  rather  than

diversity (Wylie 1998).

In this paper, I start with a description of the nature of school choice in New Zealand, looking first

at what is known about it from a family perspective, and whether that has changed over time; and

then at whether the options for families have changed over time, by looking at patterns in relation

to  enrolment  schemes.  I  then  look  at  whether  there  have  been  any  systemic  improvements  in

relation  to  one  prime  indicator  of  school  effectiveness,  the  proportion  of  those  who  leave

secondary school without any qualification. Finally, I return to the question of what competition

actually is, by looking at whether there are differences between schools in terms of whether they

perceive themselves to be in competition or not. This leads me to suggest that on the one hand, the

worst fears of increased competition between schools may be unfounded, for a range of reasons.

On the other, the best hopes of what could come from increased systemic competition also seem

unlikely to be realised.

The nature of school choice in New Zealand

New Zealand is a small country (4.1 million at the end of 2005) with a school-aged population of

756, 400 at around 2,580 schools.

Families  of  school-aged  children  can  theoretically  select  any  state  school.1  State-integrated

schools (most Roman Catholic, but also including other Christian denominations, former private

schools, and Steiner schools) are also open to those who meet their particular “special character”

criteria. These schools can also accept up a small agreed proportion of their roll, of students who

do not meet the criteria (in 2006, a Muslim student became the head girl of a Catholic secondary

school). Integrated schools receive government funding at the same level as state schools, but not

for capital costs, which they cover by charging “attendance dues”; these can be quite high. While

education  (compulsory  from  the  ages  of  5  to  16)  is  legally  free,  in  fact  schools  ask  parents  for

donations.  These  are  usually  higher  in  high-income  areas.  The  state  subsidises  school  bus  costs

for  students  in  rural  areas,  and  transport  costs  for  students  attending  integrated  schools  or  kura

kaupapa  MÃÂ¤ori  (MÃÂ¤ori  immersion  schools;  MÃÂ¤ori  are  the  indigenous  people  of  New  Zealand).

Otherwise, parents meet the transport costs of non-local choices.



1   There  are  114  private  schools,  enrolling  around  3.8  percent  of  the  student  population.  These  schools  have   received a capped amount of state funding since 2001, when a Labour-led government came into power. This  has meant increasing fees at many private schools.

Page 3 of 28

Among state schools, selection of students is theoretically limited to the state schools which have

reached capacity, and which have enrolment schemes agreed with the Ministry of Education. The

criteria  governing  selection  are  impersonal:  residence  in  the  school’s  geographical  zone,  or  by

ballot  if  there  are  spare  places  after  in-zone  applicants  have  been  catered  for.  New  Zealand  has

one of the lowest levels of social segregation in secondary schools among 27 “rich industrialised

countries”  (Jenkins,  Micklewright,  and  Schnepf  2006).  Even  so,  there  have  been  concerns  that

zones  disadvantage  students  from  low-income  homes,  and  increase  existing  social  segregation

related to housing costs.

Family access to their preferred school

Most students are at the school of first choice. The proportion that is not is probably around 10

percent  for  primary  students,  and  around  20  percent  for  secondary  students.2  1999  figures

available  for  primary  were  somewhat  highers.3  There  may  have  been  some  improvement  over

time at the national level, perhaps reflecting declines in some areas in the number of school-aged

children, thus making more places available, or perhaps reflecting an increase in the willingness

of  some  families  to  look  further  a  field.  In  2003,  around  30  percent  of  students  appeared  to  be

bypassing their closest school.

Those who bypassed their closest school were more likely to be in cities, or attending integrated

schools. At both primary and secondary levels, they were just as likely to be MÃÂ¤ori or Pacific as



2   Based on 2003 NZCER national survey figures of 7 percent for primary parents, and 15 percent for secondary  parents;  and  of  22  percent  for  secondary  students  in  their  first  or  second  year  of  secondary  school  in  2003,   mostly in the Wellington region (collected as part of the longitudinal Competent Children, Competent learners

study). A 1999 study of school choice in Palmerston North, a provincial city, found 80 percent of secondary  students’ parents said their children were at their first school choice (Wylie and Chalmers 1999), and a 1997  study of school choice in Christchurch (a major city) found 79 percent of secondary students were at their first  school choice according to their parents (Stockwell and Duckworth 1998).  3

These are from the 1999 NZCER survey (17 percent), and the 1999 Palmerston North study (18 percent).   4   The NZCER parent samples are drawn from cross-section subsamples of the national survey. This means that  parents were randomly sampled at 30 secondary schools, and 26 primary schools in 2003. Response rates were

around 33 percent at the secondary level (604 parents), 47 percent at the primary level (782 parents). These  responses cannot be representative of parents as a whole, but they do provide a useful cross-section of views,  and where comparisons can be made, these views appear to be consistent with more representative samples.

PÃÂ¤kehÃÂ¤.5  At  the  secondary  level,  they  were  more  likely  to  have  parents  in  managerial,

technical/clerical work, or professional work - but the differences in proportions are not large. To

some  extent,  this  lack  of  social  differentiation  may  reflect  the  fact  that  the  closest  secondary

school may cater for only one gender - more likely to be the case at secondary than primary level.

But  it  may  also  indicate  that  social  background  is  not  playing  a  large  part  in  decisions  to  look

further afield, and to be able to find something that is acceptable. Median distances travelled to

secondary school were somewhat higher for PakehÃÂ¤ (5-7km cf. 2-4 km for others).

The 1999 NZCER primary survey showed that those who were not at the first school choice were

more  likely  to  be  MÃÂ¤ori,  from  homes  where  parents  were  unemployed,  and  to  be  in  low  decile

schools. The same ethnic patterns are not evident in the 2003 NZCER primary survey, undertaken

at a similar but different cross-section of schools as the 1999 survey, and with similar proportions

of  different  ethnic  groups  responding.  This  change  may  indicate  that  although  there  has  been  a

growth  in  the  number  of  schools  with  enrolment  schemes,  there  is  sufficient  capacity  at  the

primary level for most. Eighty-five percent of the primary principals in the 2003 NZCER survey

had  places  on  their  roll  for  every  student  who  applied,  a  proportion  that  was  much  the  same  in

1996 and 1999. The switch to balloting may also be helping access to enrolment scheme schools.

Certainly,  it  suggests  that  the  access  of  these  groups  to  their  first  choice  school  has  not

deteriorated over time.

However, in 2003, their child’s school was twice as likely not to be the school of first choice for

parents  of  those  attending  secondary  schools  in  the  lowest  income  areas  (31  percent  of  those

attending  decile  1-2  schools  cf.  14  percent  of  those  attending  decile  3-10  schools6).  Twelve

percent of those attending decile 1-2 primary schools were not at the school of their first choice,

decreasing with decile to 3 percent of those in decile 9-10 schools.

The  same  pattern  was  evident  with  the  2003  data  from  the  Competent  Children,  Competent

Learners study sample (Wylie and Hipkins 2006). This suggests that school choice is uneven, and

that the sense of being able to obtain a preferred school is lowest for those in low-income areas.



5   PÃÂ¤kehÃÂ¤ was a MÃÂ¤ori term for the Europeans who began colonising New Zealand in the early 19th century, and  is  a  common  term  for  New  Zealanders  of  European  descent.  Sixty  percent  of  the  student  population  are   PÃÂ¤kehÃÂ¤, 22 percent are MÃÂ¤ori, 9 percent are of Pacific origin, and 8 percent, Asian.

6   New  Zealand  state  and  integrated  schools  are  assigned  to  deciles  based  on  socioeconomic  indicators  drawn   from census mesh-block data in relation to a sample of students’ home addresses. Decile 1 is the lowest socio-economic area, and decile 10 the highest. These deciles are public knowledge, and are often referred to. The

reason  for  this  assignment  was  in  order  to  allocate  additional  operating  funding  to  schools  serving  students   from low-income communities, in the three lowest deciles. The National (conservative) government extended  this to include decile 9 schools. The Labour-led government that came to power in late 1999 increased the per-student amount going to low-decile schools, but did not return to the original intent of the funding. Had it done  so,  other  schools,  by  now  used  to  the  additional  money  and  feeling  squeezed  to  cover  all  costs  from  their   operational grants, would have been loud in their public protests.    Schools  can  change  decile  -  sometimes  because  of  the  change  in  their  own  intake,  sometimes  because  of   changes at other schools that then shift the rank of all schools. The use of census data (available every 5 years)  means that the data used to determine decile can also get out of date.

Other more locality-based data also indicates that social differences in choice do occur unevenly,

and  are  most  evident  in  low-income  areas.  The  Smithfield  study  found  in  1994  that  those  who

bypassed  their  closest  school  where  it  was  “low  circuit”  (a  low  mean  socioeconomic  status  of

students, co-educational, and declining rolls) were more likely to be from high and middle income

families,  and  to  be  PÃÂ¤kekÃÂ¤  (Lauder  and  Hughes  1999).  A  1996  study  in  the  low-income  South

Auckland area of Auckland found that preference for schools outside that area was higher among

those  in  the  higher-income  part  of  this  area,  and  among  PÃÂ¤kehÃÂ¤  (Stockwell  and  Hewitt  1996).

Reasons for preferring a school out of this local area were given as the standard of education, a

preference for schools with “less cultural emphasis”, and to a lesser extent, that the local schools

had  a  reputation  of  being  “rough”.  A  similar  pattern  was  evident  in  a  parent  survey  in  a  low

income area with some middle income pockets in Lower Hutt in 1997 (no author 1997).

Parental choice, if based on deciles, may further increase existing social segregation (rather than

create it), where there are high-income areas adjacent to low-income areas. Manukau city (a low

income area of the largest urban area in New Zealand, Auckland), for example, has no mid-decile

schools, though it has some mid-decile communities (Gerritson 2006).

Thus we have some evidence that the New Zealand system has not been able to counter housing-based  social  segregation  (as  we  shall  see,  this  is  not  surprising  since  school enrolment schemes

are geographically based), and that this has most impact on those in low-income areas.

The New Zealand research brings out some themes that are related to the pattern of, on the one

hand,  relatively  high  attendance  at  the  school  of  first  choice,  and  on  the  other,  indications  of

different  patterns  in  some  locations,  particularly  low-income  adjacent  to  higher-income  areas.

These themes are important to consider in gauging the nature and role of family choice in other

countries.

Decisionmaking around school choice  Information  about  schools  used  to  make  decisions  is  often  received  through  informal  channels,

consistent with family and friends being important in school choice. The importance of informed

choice is often emphasised by the advocates of choice-based provision, but this role of informal

information raises questions about how realistic this would be (even if full timely information can

be  given  and  understood),  and  whether  personal  relationships  would  nonetheless  carry  more

weight  for  many  students  and  families  than  the  kind  of  information  that  school  choice  theorists

believe decisions should be made on.

In an interview for a study of effective schools’ financial management, the principal of a school

that  was  highly  regarded  by  educators  was  grappling  with  trying  to  maintain  the  school’s

programme by trying to sustain roll numbers in an area where there were fewer younger families.

She  spoke  to  me  of  the  frustration  she  felt  when  student  decisions  were  made  on  the  basis  of

where  their  (then)  friends  were  going,  rather  than  whether  the  chosen  school  could  meet  their

needs, and offer an effective programme.

Students are often involved in the choice of school (though parents and their children may see this

somewhat differently, and there are different patterns of children’s involvement across different

social  groups).  Again,  student  considerations  do  not  always  match  those  of  the  school  choice

theorists.

A  sizeable  minority  of  parents  in  fact  do  not  consider  more  than  one  school.  The  Palmerston

North  study  found  that  around  half  the  primary  and  a  quarter  of  the  secondary  school  parents

considered only one school in making their choice. Others who did consider two or more schools

looked beyond a neighbourhood or familiar school only if they were dissatisfied, or heard more

favourable reports of another. Thus location and familiarity continue to matter in an open-choice

system (rather than comparative effectiveness, for example).

Few parents give only one reason when they are asked about the reasons for their preference. The

main reasons found in 2003 with the Competent Children, Competent Learners study sample were

the school’s ‘reputation’, its proximity, family tradition, and friends going there. There were no

clear  social  differences  here,  either  in  relation  to  the  socioeconomic  status  of  the  family,  or  the

decile  level  of  the  school  chosen  (Wylie  and  Hipkins  2006).  Other  surveys  have  found  that

parents choosing high decile schools are more likely to mention academic results specifically (e.g.

Stockwell and Duckworth 1997).

Does it matter that students are in the first choice school?  While  not  everyone  may  get  their  first  choice  of  school,  experience  of  the  school  can  change

perceptions: half of those who were not in their first choice secondary school in the Competent

Children,  Competent  Learners  study  would  in  fact  choose  their  current  school  if  they  could  go

back in time - and conversely, 18 percent of those who were at their first school choice would not

do  so.  The  1997  Christchurch  study  found  that  levels  of  parental  satisfaction  with  their  child’s

secondary school were just as high for those whose child was not at the first choice school, as for

those who were.

Attending the school of first choice was not related to early secondary students’ engagement with

school or overall levels of class achievement in multivariate analysis carried out in the Competent

Children, Competent Learners study. Other factors had more weight, particularly prior levels of

performance  and  school  engagement,  and  parental  interests.  The  latter  is  consistent  with  the

qualitative  analyses  of  Lareau  (2000)  and  others  showing  that  different  parental  strategies  have

different results for children; it is not clear how extending school competition would address these

differences in parental strategy.

It is important to note that parental satisfaction with the quality of schooling was high at the start

of  the  New  Zealand  reforms,  and  has  remained  so.  In  the  2003  NZCER  national  surveys,  87

percent  of  primary  parents  were  generally  happy  with  the  quality  of  their  child’s  schooling  -  a

proportion that has remained much the same over the NZCER surveys since 1989, the first year of

decentralisation.  The  NZCER  2003  secondary  survey  found  85  percent  of  parents  were  also

generally  happy;  a  1997  survey  of  Christchurch  parents  of  Years  9  and  10  students  found  93

Page 7 of 28

percent  were  satisfied  or  very  satisfied  with  the  school  their  child  attended  9  (Stockwell  and

Duckworth  1998).  These  surveys  are  consistent  with  the  figure  of  nearly  80  percent  of  parents

saying  they  were  satisfied  with  the  standard  of  education  their  children  received  in  a  National

Business Review opinion poll also in 2003.7

There has not been a marked swing to innovative schools (this is consistent with Brown’s (1997)

analysis  of  the  imperfection  of  the  education  market  in  economic  terms).  Support  for  schools

offering markedly different approaches is limited to a handful of small schools in urban areas, to

kura  kaupapa  MÃÂ¤ori  (also  in  rural  areas  with  strong  MÃÂ¤ori  traditions)  and  some  Pacific  island

immersion  programmes.  Vaughan  (2004)  charts  some  changes  in  the  diversity  available  within

state schools, and the way in which formerly ‘alternative’ approaches have been incorporated into

mainstream provision in an evolutionary rather than revolutionary way. Boyd’s (2005) evaluation

of curriculum innovation programmes in secondary schools and Gilbert’s (2005) analysis of the

way that the current organisation of secondary education militates against the providing the kind

of educational experience best suited to the development of the knowledge and skills needed in

the 21st century show that the obstacles facing positive innovation are not solvable through either

family choice or individual schools acting in isolation. Positive innovation of this kind will take

substantial  political  will,  additional  funding  to  support  demonstrations,  the  development  of

infrastructure, and work with parents and the wider community (including business).

The  experience  of  extending  family  choice  of  schools  may  be  different  in  countries  or  systems

that  start  with  lower  parental  satisfaction  with  schools  (or  trust),  higher  social  segregation,  and

shortages of schools or places in schools.

Some of the other themes that have emerged in New Zealand indicate that the education market

remains imperfect (in terms of economic theory), and also raise questions about whether family

choice should be the litmus test of the worth of a system, since many of those who are not at their

first  choice  come  to  enjoy  where  they  are,  and  not  being  at  the  first  choice  of  school  does  not

seem to disadvantage students. However, the fact that those in low-income areas are less able to

access schools they regard as preferable raises questions about how one can create fair systems of

choice, or, if this seems too difficult, what is needed to improve perceptions of the worth of low-decile schools, and ensure that they are able to provide the rich education that students in these

areas need and deserve.

Enrolment schemes

The main reason why New Zealand students are not at the first choice of school is that the school

preferred had an enrolment scheme, whose geographical zone did not include the place where the

family lived. The table below compares reasons given by parents using late 1990s surveys and the



7   Parental complaints to the government agency responsible for reviewing schools, ERO, did increase markedly  from  the  2001/02  year  (218,  including  early  childhood  education  centres)  to  411  in  2003/04  (360  about   schools); and have since stabilised.

2003  NZCER  surveys.  With  the  caveats  around  the  small  numbers  involved,  and  that  the  data

used  for  secondary  students  compares  a  single-location  survey  and  the  national  cross-section

survey,  there  are  indications  here  that  while  the  proportion  of  those  not  at  their  first  preferred

school  has  not  risen,  enrolment  schemes  may  be  playing  more  of  a  role  in  not  getting  in  than

previously. Certainly they are not playing less of a role. This seems more likely to be because the

number of schools with enrolment schemes increased markedly over this period, rather than the

return to balloting from 2001 (though to be sure of that, one would probably need a closer locality

analysis). Cost and transport also feature.

There were no statistically significant differences among social groups in relation to these reasons

(but the numbers were small once broken down further into different social groups).

The chart below shows the changes in enrolment schemes since the 1989 reforms.



Changes in enrolment schemes:

before 1989: many secondary schools had home zones, agreed with the Department of Education.

Primary  schools  did  not  have  zones;  parents  could  choose  -  rare  to  choose  anything  other  than

nearest school; established ‘feeder’ patterns with particular secondary schools.

1989-1991: home zones for all secondary schools operating at capacity; spare places decided by

ballot

1992  -  National  government  abolishes  home  zones;  schools  that  are  operating  at  capacity

(primary  as  well  as  secondary)  can  set  their  own  enrolment  scheme.  (“Most  start  with  a  small

geographic  zone  and  then  give  preference  to  siblings  of  current  students  and  to  the  children  of

staff  members  and  former  students.  But  many  schools,  especially  the  most  popular  ones,  have

rules  that  for  all  practical  purposes  allow  the  principal  to  admit  whomever  he  or  she  chooses”

Fiske & Ladd (2000), p. 182).

Page 9 of 28

1998  -  National  government  restores  home  zones;  Ministry  of  Education  approval  needed  for

enrolment  schemes,  taking  into  account  the  ‘reasonable  use  of  the  network  of  schools’,  and

schools should consult with local communities in developing their scheme.

2000 - Labour-led government provides a set priority order for any spare places after students in

the  defined  zone  (those  in  a  special  programme  run  by  the  school8;  siblings;  children  of  school

staff); all others decided by ballot. Ballots would also be used if the number applying within each

of  the  priority  groups  was  higher  than  the  number  of  spare  places  (Dowler  2005,  personal

communication).9

Before  1989,  many  secondary  schools  were  zoned,  but  students  were  free  to  apply  to  other

schools,  which  could  take  them  if  they  had  room.  McCulloch  (1991)  provides  a  valuable

description of what this meant in practice. He notes that zoning appealed to a range of purposes

including planning and efficiency in resource use at both the school and national levels, and some

regulation  of  schools  taking  action  that  could  negatively  affect  their  neighbours.  However,  the

existence  of  zones  did  not  stop  some  schools  growing  by  taking  out-of-zone  students  -  and  the

schools  that  gained  tended  to  be  the  more  prestigious,  longer-established,  or  those  in  higher

income communities. They were also able to do their own selection, often on the basis of student

tests.

The schools that were bypassed tended to be in lower-income areas. Even before 1989, this meant

loss  of  staff  and  funding  if  rolls  fell.  It  also  increased  social  segregation  in  some  cities,  and

allowed  some  schools  to  retain  or  enhance  their  “academic”  status  by  selecting  the  out-of-zone

applicants  most  likely  to  enhance  that  status.  What  happened  in  1991  was  that  the  purpose  of

zoning changed, and the existence of a school zone became an additional signal of high status, as

well as a protection of advantage for those living in the high income areas wanting access to these

schools.

The spread of schools with enrolment schemes is one of the most striking aspects of the changes

in the New Zealand school landscape since 1989. In 1990, no primary schools had zones, and only

9  percent  of  secondary  schools,  most  in  Auckland,  had  zones.  By  2004,  there  were  zones  for

around  a  quarter  of  secondary  schools,  and  18  percent  of  primary  schools.  National  roll  growth

1999-2004  was  5.2%;  however,  the  proportion  of  students  attending  enrolment-scheme  schools

grew to 38% (including those at 22 integrated schools), and the number of schools with enrolment

schemes (termed ES schools below) doubled. They are more likely to be in cities.



8   These include special education classes, MÃÂ¤ori language immersion programmes, Pacific language immersion  or  bilingual  programmes;  programmes  for  students  who  have  refugee  status;  teen  parent  units;  alternative   education programmes; adult migrant programmes; Montessori programmes; a specialist music programmes at

one Christchurch secondary and a feeder primary; and a French language programme at an Auckland primary  school.   9   Twenty-two  integrated  schools  had  enrolment  schemes  in  2004  (covering  6.4  percent  of  integrated  school

rolls): most of these are Catholic. These schemes do not have to be geographically based.

The  table  below  shows  that  while  there  are  some  low  decile  ES  schools,  they  are  very  few.  By

2004, the proportion of ES schools in each socioeconomic decile followed the decile ranking in a

pretty linear fashion, and just under half the decile 10 schools were also ES schools.

Pearce  and  Gordon  (2005)  show  that  the  ideology  of  self-managing  schools,  coupled  with  a

hands-off role for the Ministry of Education during the 1990s, allowing schools to set their own

criteria, was not in fact politically sustainable. They describe the pressure that led to the return of

Page 11 of 28

zones  in  1998  -  cases  of  students  living  close  to  a  school  who  could  not  attend  it;  cases  of

students who missed out without clear reason. These cases were often in middle-class areas. There

continues to be pressure from some principals of schools at the ‘top end’ of the decile ranking to

be allowed to select students, usually on grounds that can be thought of as ‘cream-skimming’ if

looked at from a school perspective; or as ‘meritocracy’ if looked at from the perspective of the

small number of students who would thereby access a school that they could not otherwise access,

or afford. Their ideal is probably the situation of 1998-2000. However, most of the small number

of these prestige schools are by now victims of their own popularity, and do not have spare places.

Auckland Boys Grammar, for example, now employs someone to check claims of zone residence,

given  its  experience  of  false  claims,  or  temporary  lodging  taken  at  the  time  of  enrolment.  Real

estate  agents  routinely  include  school  zones  in  advertisements  where  these  are  for  prestigious

schools; and house prices in prestigious school zones have increased at a higher rate than in other

areas  (Auckland  Property  Review  2002;  McClay  and  Harrison  2003).10  Last-minute  enrolments

can  cause  difficulties  for  popular  schools  in  relation  to  having  to  hire  new  teachers  (at  a  time

when they may have less selection than they would want, and be uncertain whether they can offer

a more attractive permanent appointment), and timetables. In 2006 one school noted that because

of  late  enrolments  in  senior  levels,  some  students  would  miss  out  on  their  first  subject  choices

because class sizes were now too big (Boyes 2006).

But  it  is  not  clear  whether  the  spread  of  ES  schools  has  merely  reflected  existing  social

stratification  patterns,  or  increased  it  in  relation  to  narrowing  educational  opportunities.  The

number  of  schools  with  really  small  zones  is  not  high.  In  a  study  of  zoning  patterns  in

Christchurch,  Pearce  and  Gordon  (n.d).  note  that  “quite  large  areas  of  low  deprivation  [are]

guaranteed access to a high decile secondary school.” However, they also describe how primary

schools  in  one  high-income  area  have  set  zones  that,  while  overlapping  and  thereby  providing

choice  within  the  area,  have  carefully  excluded  some  lower-income  areas  that  are  physically

closer  to  individual  schools.  Other  examples  of  what  appears  to  be  strategic  zone-setting  to

exclude  students  from  low  income  areas  are  from  schools  situated  in  high  income  areas  with  a

lower-income  area  close  by.  By  contrast,  examples  of  high  decile  primary  schools  without

enrolment schemes occur where primary schools’ neighbours are of similar high decile.

Some  further  strategic  decisions  around  enrolment  may  also  occur  in  relation  to  deciding  the

number of spare places. Enrolment schemes do not set a maximum roll number, and government

funding  that  is  determined  by  roll  is  based  on  the  actual  number  of  enrolments.  Boards  are

required  to  determine  by  September  the  number  of  places  they  will  have  available  for  students

who live outside the home zone. Foreign fee-paying students (whose numbers grew dramatically



10   Removing  zoning  could  therefore  reduce  the  value  of  homes  in  these  areas;  political  commentators  in  one   business magazine cited this as a tension for the National party’s policy of relaxing zoning to improve school  choice, given that its voters could be the ones most likely to lose out on selling their house (Young & Thomas

2006). McCulloch (1991) noted earlier that the National party’s policy of abandoning zoning cost it votes in  key conservative electorates in 1987 in the “Grammar zone” in Auckland, both for concerns about preserving  the value of family investments, and access as of right to prestigious schools.

in  recent  years  before  starting  to  decline  in  2004)  must  not  fill  places  provided  for  domestic

students.11

There are no national figures available on the number of students who do apply out-of-zone, and

their acceptance rates, so it is difficult to know to what extent ES status is both an attraction, and a

difficulty for would-be students, and how that has changed over time. While the NZCER survey

figures show around a third of students bypassing their closest school, Pearce and Gordon (n.d.)

have shown that not every student in fact has access as of right to their closest school.

Lauder and Hughes (1999) suggested that the 1998 changes would not lead to substantial changes

in school enrolment schemes, or produce more equitable student access to schools with enrolment

schemes.  This  prediction  appears  to  have  been  borne  out;  but  there  is  some  evidence  (largely

anecdotal) that the changes that began in 2001 have widened access, where there were sufficient

spare  places  for  a  ballot  of  those  not  in  the  priority  groups.  For  example,  management  staff  in

several high decile schools in the NZCER school funding study (Wylie and King 2005) who were

in  this  position  talked  of  seeing  lower  average  achievement  scores  in  their  year  9  entrants  after

they  switched  to  selection  for  remaining  places  by  ballot,  and  this  had  led  to  their  providing  a

wider range of courses.

Being an ES school appears to confer some advantages in terms of attracting students - but not

always.





11   It is not clear how the latter can be assessed; many schools with enrolment schemes that do not take all who  apply  also  take  foreign  fee-paying  students.  Fees  from  these  students  cover  the  cost  of  providing  specific   additional courses, e.g. English as a second language, as well as revenue for the school as a whole, often used

to  extend  the  range  of  subjects  offered.  The  self-funding  nature  of  foreign  fee-paying  students  makes  it   problematic to judge whether in fact they may in some cases be taking places that would otherwise have gone  to domestic out-of-zone applicants. One school principal talked to me in 2005 of taking far more out-of-zone  applicants than usual because of the drop in foreign fee-paying students between 2004 and 2005.

Table 5 also shows that the changes to enrolment schemes did little to change the loss of students

at low decile schools and the continued growth of rolls at higher decile schools that was evident in

the 1990s. Fiske and Ladd (2000) show that low decile schools in Wellington, Christchurch and

Auckland  lost  students  over  the  1991-96  period  to  higher  decile  schools;  a  pattern  that  was

different from the previous five years. Harker (2000a) shows that nationally, low decile primary

schools grew less than higher decile primary schools (decile 5 schools showed the most growth)

over a period of growing rolls 1994-98. In terms of social selection, he also found that the median

roll  at  high  decile  schools  with  more  than  20  percent  MÃÂ¤ori  students  declined  -  but  increased

substantially at high decile schools with less than 20 percent MÃÂ¤ori enrolment. Roll changes 1991-1998 in secondary schools showed the same trends more starkly.

Thus we have an interesting picture. There is some fluidity of individual student movement that

does not seem to decrease with the increase with the growth of ES schools. However, it is in only

one direction, as predicted by most researchers who have analysed reasons for school choice. The

evidence  suggests  that  competition  for  students  does  not  create  more  even  social  mixes.  The

proportions  of  students  from  lower  income  backgrounds  entering  higher  decile  schools  are  not

high enough to change their decile substantially.

The New Zealand picture is of particular interest because it is one of the longest running systems

of open choice coupled with school self-management. Under the New Zealand conditions, there is

little evidence that the hopes of some school choice advocates of using choice to counter social

segregation within educational provision can be met.

I turn next to the other great hope, that it will improve schools, and thus student achievement.

Page 14 of 28

Does competition improve student achievement?

On international comparisons, New Zealand students score well; they are usually within the group

scoring above average. This was the case before 1989; and the picture has not changed. However,

while New Zealand usually has a larger proportion of students scoring at the top end, it also has a

large  proportion  scoring  at  the  lower  end,  and  a  relatively  wide  range  compared  to  other  high

scoring countries. This has been of policy concern for some time, with added attention in recent

years as economists note population growth in groups with lower educational achievement, in an

era where further economic stability and growth will need high national educational levels.

Harker (2000b) noted that roll drops in low decile secondary schools left many with rolls under

500, and argued that this size was too small to allow effective education, or to provide a full range

of subject options. His analysis shows a small decline in the proportion of students in decile 1-2

schools leaving with a 7th form qualification, in contrast to increases for other schools, particularly

decile  9-10  schools,  and  his  interpretation  is  that  “skimming”  is  occurring  to  the  benefit  of  the

non-decile 1-2 schools. (This is unlikely to account for all the difference.)

In its 2005 briefing to the incoming Minister of Education, the Ministry of Education noted the

rise  in  students  gaining  some  qualification  from  2002,  when  NCEA  was  introduced.  “These

results represent for the first time, in at least a decade, a significant reduction in the proportion of

school leavers with little or no formal attainment.” (Ministry of Education 2005, p. 46).

Thus at an overall level, there is little evidence to show that the 1989 reforms had any effect on

student achievement. It was only when the country changed its approach to qualifications at the

secondary  level  (for  reasons  that  have  to  do  with  trying  to  engage  a  wider  range  of  students  in

school,  and  provide  more  equity  in  recognition  of  “vocational”  and  “academic”  knowledge  and

skills; see Hipkins and Vaughan 2005), that this stubborn indicator of system difficulty or failure

started to shift.

To  see  whether  they  might  have  affected  schools  differentially,  or  reduced  the  gap  between

schools,  we  compared  trends  over  time  in  the  median  proportion  of  school  leavers  with  no

qualification  for  secondary  schools  with  different  places  in  the  education  “market”  (those  with

enrolment schemes in 1999 (ES schools), those without (non-ES schools), and integrated schools),

within school quintile groups (decile 1 and 2, 3 and 4 etc). Only schools with complete data on

school leavers qualifications held by the Ministry of Education are included in this analysis.

The comparison is over average percentages of school leavers without qualification for three time-periods  corresponding  to  different  versions  of  the  enrolment  scheme  criteria.  The  first  period,

1995-1998 is for the time when ES schools could decide who they would select (and how much

weight  to  give  their  home  zone);  the  second  period,  1999-2000  is  when  they  were  to  give

preference to home zone students, but could make their selection of out-of-zone students on their

own grounds; and the third period is from 2001-2004, when ES schools had to decide any spare

places for out of zone students by ballot. We have used 1999 ES and decile categories partly as a

Page 15 of 28

mid-point  over  the  time-period,  but  also  to  see  if  the  advantages  of  having  ES  status  would  be

evident over time (from 1999 to 2004).

The figure below shows that:

ÃÂ  At  the  same  socioeconomic  quintile  level,  ES  and  integrated  schools  had  lower

proportions of students leaving without any qualification than non ES schools over this

ten-year  period.  The  only  schools  that  had  40  percent  or  more  of  their  students  leave

without any qualification were decile 1-6 non-ES schools;

ÃÂ  Whatever  the  school  status,  there  is  no  improvement  in  the  pattern  following  the

modification to the enrolment scheme criteria taking effect in 1999 - thus there seems to

have  been  no  advantage  for  ES  schools,  and  no  (further)  disadvantage  for  non-ES

schools;

ÃÂ  There is little improvement in the pattern following the switch to balloting taking effect

in 2001; and

ÃÂ  There  is  little  evidence  that  the  range  of  school  proportions  of  leavers  without

qualifications has narrowed over time - in other words, there are still similar proportions

of schools with high levels of leavers without qualifications. Within each decile, non-ES

schools have the widest range as a group.

At  this  level,  there  are  no  clear  signs  that  competition  is  operating  as  a  lever  to  improve  less

popular schools (non-ES schools). There are indications that it may be preserving the advantages

for those attending ES schools - but not enhancing those further.

There  are  insufficient  numbers  of  schools  in  some  of  the  categories  above  to  analyse  whether

there were changes in the range of proportions of school-leavers without qualification in relation

to school status, either by enrolment scheme or decile.12 We therefore had to analyse these two

aspects separately.

Figure 2 shows:

ÃÂ  little change in either the median or range of school proportions of school leavers without

qualification  after  1999  for  either  the  ES  or  integrated  schools:  in  other  words,  any

advantage  from  this  status  did  not  translate  into  improvements  in  student  achievement.

For ES schools, there is some lowering of the median and bringing down the top quartile

after  1998,  when  schools  had  to  have  a  home  zone.  But  there  is  minimal  difference

between  the  home-zone/no  ballot  and  home-zone/ballot  periods.  That  may  be  of  some

comfort  for  those  in  these  schools  who  are  uncomfortable  with  the  idea  of  a  ballot

deciding school entry;

ÃÂ  The introduction of balloting may, on the other hand, have helped the non-ES schools a

little, with some reduction of the proportion of schools with higher proportions of school-leavers without qualifications between 1999-00 and 2001-04.

Figure  3  is  less  comforting.  It  seems  to  indicate  that  while  decile  9-10  schools  have  kept  their

proportion  of  leavers  without  qualification  low,  and  fewer  schools  in  the  2001-04  period  had

higher  proportions  (but  still  substantially  below  the  median  for  decile  1-4  schools),  schools  in

other  decile  groups  show  fewer  gains  in  either  median  or  range.  This  suggests  that  decile,  or

socio-economic  factors,  are  more  important  to  patterns  of  student  achievement  than  whether

schools  have  enrolment  schemes  or  are  integrated  -  whatever  those  traits  signal  to  families  in

terms of preference or reputation.13

13   ES schools were less likely to have had a supplementary Education Review Office review (indicating major  problems in the regular 3-yearly cycle of school reviews by this government agency): 14 percent cf. 33 percent  of Non-ES schools, and 33 percent of integrated schools). They were also likely to have more stable finances

overall: 2.6 percent of the ES schools ran a deficit over the last 3 years c.f. 5% of Non-ES schools, and 5.8  percent had posted a surplus for all three years cf. 3.6 percent of Non-ES schools.

School experiences of competition

Why should we see so little change over more than a decade? Why hasn’t competition on its own

sharpened schools’ capability to address the problem of students leaving without qualifications?

One  of  the  most  insightful  studies  of  what  competition  might  mean  in  education  is  Levacic’s

(2001)  study  of  the  relationship  between  a  structural  definition  of  competition  (the  number  of

schools in a local market or the degree of concentration), and competitive behaviour, and between

these different conceptualisations of competition and student performance. The study has further

significance  because  it  looks  at  the  effects  over  time  where  there  is  systemic  competition,  as  in

New Zealand. She found little relationship between English secondary head teachers’ perceptions

of competition and structural indicators, suggesting that this may be because perceptions of a high

degree  of  competition  were  more  likely  to  be  associated  with  “rivalrous  competitive  conduct”;

and if so, this would account for why student achievement did not rise more where head teachers

thought  their  school  faced  a  high  degree  of  competition.  She  observes  that  “As  in  commercial

markets, not all forms of competitive conduct stimulate improved performance for the consumer."

There was no positive impact in relation to structural measures of concentration, or the proportion

of schools that were grant-maintained (usually higher-status). Nor was there any association with

any  of  these  measures  of  competition  and  school  performance  on  “the  more  inclusive  but  less

publicised GCSE2 indicator.” However, where head teachers said they had 5 or more competitors,

the  estimated  impact  was  a  4.5-5  percent  increase  in  the  percentage  of  students  obtaining  5  or

more  grade  A*  to  C  for  the  GCSE  examinations,  which  are  used  to  rank  schools  against  each

other in league tables (and to identify “failing” schools).

Levacic concludes that:

Page 19 of 28

… schools exhibit better performance in terms of the headline indicator when there is more  perceived  competition.  It  is  suggested  that  this  is  due  both  to  greater  stimulus  to  improve   and maintain the school’s position in the local hierarchy and to more opportunities for co-operation and emulation related to product quality.14

She makes the case for using a more inclusive measure of school performance:

Putting  to  one  side  the  problems  of  a  raw  examination  score  as  an  indicator  of  school   quality,  the  total  average  GCSE  score  per  pupil  is  a  better  raw  exam  score  indicator  than   GCSE1.  It  does  not  induce  schools  to  concentrate  on  particular  pupils  and  reflects  the   achievements of all pupils in a school. (p 40).

Unlike the Levacic study, most studies of education markets continue to rely on secondary cross-sectional  data,  and  to  approach  competition  in  structural  terms  only.  Belfield  and  Levin  (2005)

review US studies of the effects of competitive pressure on schools, using such data-sets. Much of

the comparison is not between individual schools (as it is in studies in England and New Zealand,

where  school  choice  and  self-managing  schools  are  systemic)  but  between  systems,  such  as

private  vs  public  school;  or  one  district  vs  another.  Their  review  shows  modest  benefits  for

student achievement from this kind of competition, but they raise questions about the degree and

feasibility of reform required to increase competition, in order to get (only) modest results.

Gibbons and Silva (2006) raise questions about the use of concentration of schools as a measure

of  school  competition  because  families  may  have  already  “sorted”  themselves  through  housing

choices,  thus  presenting  some  potential  endogeneity  between  school  concentration  and  school

quality. They have focused on the performance of schools, using school value-added point scores

(the  difference  between  age-11  and  age-7  point  scores,  averaged  at  school  level)  They  find  no

causal effect on English primary school performance from competition:

Most  of  the  observed  positive  correlation  between  the  number  of  competing  schools  and   pupil  attainments  is  driven  by  unobserved  neighbourhood  characteristics  or  endogenous   selection of pupils with choice into better quality schools.15



14   Gibbons  (2002)  found  in  a  study  of  English  primary  schools  that  even  after  controlling  for  socioeconomic   characteristics of both schools and catchment areas (thus allowing for spatial autocorrelation), “good primary  schools tend to be located near other good primary schools and bad schools near other bad schools… could be

[due  to]  a  neighbourhood  human  capital  spillover,  operating  through  social  interaction  of  pupils  from   neighbouring schools, or a knowledge spillover in terms of teaching technologies.” (pp. 28-29).   15   Castle and Evans (2006) also raise the issue of endogeneity in their analysis of research on the effects of the

specialist  school  policy  in  England,  and  conclude  that  it  is  impossible  to  tell  whether  it  is  their  nature  (as   specialist  schools)  that  lies  behind  their  being  more  high  performing  than  other  secondary  schools,  or  their   effectiveness anyway, because the more effective schools were most likely to have become specialist schools.  Much the same issue would probably confront any analysis in New Zealand comparing performance over time  of ES and non-ES schools. They also note that comparisons of specialist and non-specialist schools do not take  into account comparative costs, or whether the greater selectivity of specialist schools led to increased social  stratification  in  an  area,  and  more  concentration  of  less  motivated  students  at  non-specialist  schools.  Citing   Levacic’s 2004 study of specialist schools that found 92 percent of the unexplained variance in examination  results to lie at the student level, and only 7 percent at the school level, they argue that “This implies that for a

Page 20 of 28

Their analysis also suggests that “school competition may exacerbate stratification of schools by

student attainment.” (pp. 30-31)

How real is competition in New Zealand?

How real is competition in New Zealand? If we define it structurally, in terms of concentration of

numbers of schools, and bearing in mind Levacic’s finding of a positive effect only where there

were more than 5 schools competing, and not for fewer numbers, then much of New Zealand does

not  experience  competition  that  might  make  a  positive  difference.  The  social  and  economic

landscape of the country would have to change substantially to provide such competition: hardly a

feasible proposition either politically or practically.

If we define it in terms of perceptions, on the grounds that this is how it can be a driver of change,

then the evidence is that competition is still not pervasive in New Zealand, more than a decade

after  the  1989  reforms.  Sixty  percent  of  secondary  principals  in  the  2003  NZCER  survey  said

there was some competition in their relations with other local secondary schools, as did 43 percent

of the primary principals in the NZCER 2003 survey, up from 30 percent in 1999, and 21 percent

in 1996.

This  is  not  unalloyed  competition.  Primary  principals  in  2003  who  thought  their  school

experienced  some  competition  were  just  as  likely  as  those  who  did  not  to  share  professional

development  (61  percent),  and  information  on  individual  students  (42  percent).  They  were  less

likely  to  share  resources  or  give  mutual  support  (38  percent  cf.  58  percent  of  non-competitive

schools).  This  indicates  that  schools’  sense  of  competition  is  not  wholesale  or  open-ended,  but

may be limited to particular schools. Fourteen percent had no/limited contact with other schools,

cf. 6 percent of non-competition schools.

Primary  school  competition  was  more  likely  to  be  experienced  in  small  town  and  small  city

schools,  where  perhaps  rivalries  are  more  transparent.  As  in  1999,  there  was  no  relationship

between a sense of competition and the school characteristics of decile or type. The median roll

was slightly lower for non-competition schools (166 cf. 180 for competitive schools)

Competition schools were just as likely as non-competition schools to have an enrolment scheme,

and  have  schools  around  them  with  enrolment  schemes,  places  for  all  who  apply,  or  want  an

increase in school’s physical capacity to take all applicants.

Twenty-three percent of the primary competition schools had made major changes to their school

promotion/marketing  cf.  12  percent  of  non-competitors.  This  is  similar  to  previous  surveys.

Otherwise,  and  also  in  line  with  previous  NZCER  surveys,  there  is  no  difference  between

competing  and  non-competing  schools  in  their  initiation  of  different  programmes  and  policies

aimed at improving achievement and engagement for particular social groups, or taking up some



really  big  impact  on  attainment,  education  policy  would  need  to  exert  leverage  on  families’  and  young   peoples’ attitudes and motivations.”

Page 21 of 28

of  the  innovative  approaches  that  try  to  integrate  thinking  and  problem-solving  skills  with  the

traditional  academic  areas.16  Unlike  in  1999,  those  who  thought  of  themselves  as  facing

competition  in  2003  were  no  more  likely  than  those  who  were  not  to  feel  there  was  some

curriculum or programme innovation they would like to implement, but could not.

How enduring is the sense of competition?

Of  the  157  schools  whose  principals  took  part  in  both  the  1999  and  2003  NZCER  national

primary school surveys:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ 48 percent were not in competitive relations in either 1999 or 2003

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ 20 percent experienced some competition in 2003, but not in 1999;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ 15 percent experienced some competition in 1999, but not 2003; and

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ only 17 percent experienced competition at both ends of the 5-year period.

Thus  if  principals  need  to  feel  in  competition  to  be  motivated  to  provide  good  leadership  or

improve the quality of education at their school, or to improve efficiencies in their operation just

over half experienced some over this 5-year period; and it was a continuing reality for only about

1 in 6: hardly a reliable lever.

The  schools  that  experienced  competition  in  both  1999  and  2003  were  least  likely  to  have

reasonably stable rolls (roll stability helps schools plan; Wylie and King 2004), and most likely to

have lost more than a fifth of their roll over the 5-year period. More of these schools had another

local school with an enrolment scheme (rather than all nearby schools), suggesting a local winner

at the expense of one or more losers. They had lower levels of parent and community support, or

parents discussing student reports with teachers. They were more likely to have school-business

links, and to be involved in three or more externally funded projects. They were no more, or less

likely  to  be  undertaking  programmes  based  on  more  individualised  learning,  though  they  were

more likely to offer accelerated learning programmes (which appeal to some parents). They were

more  likely  to  say  they  could  not  make  desired  programme/curriculum  innovations  because  of

lack of time, money, staffing levels, or staff expertise. They were no more likely than others to

cite national curriculum requirements as an obstacle to these innovations.

These schools experiencing continual competition were just as likely to “pass” their ERO review

over the 1996-2004 period: there were no signs that these were either substantially more effective,

or less effective schools than those who did not experience competition.



16   Ladd & Fiske undertook further analysis of principal and teacher data from the 1996 NZCER national survey.  This analysis suggested that “neither competition among schools nor the loss of students had much impact on  [principals’] perceptions of student learning.” (Ladd and Fiske 2003, p. 107). However, both were related to

teachers’  perceptions  of  the  impact  of  decentralisation  on  student  learning;  with  gains  less  likely  to  be  seen   where  schools  were  seen  as  in  competition  or  had  roll  drops.  Competition  was  also  negatively  related  to   teacher job satisfaction.

Secondary schools and competition

The  2003  NZCER  survey  data  show  a  similar  lack  of  substantial  difference  between  secondary

schools  in  competition,  and  those  who  are  not.  Roll  stability  was  highest  where  schools  were

neither  in  competitive  situations,  nor  had  an  enrolment  scheme  -  often  because  there  were  no

other local secondary schools.

Conclusion

The  New  Zealand  evidence,  from  a  national  system  of  open-choice  and  self-managing  schools

that  is  now  well-established,  shows  just  how  complex  competition  really  is,  and  raises  some

sobering questions for the proponents of this approach.

Competition of the kind that is theorised will sharpen school performance and therefore “lift all

boats” does not occur pervasively for many reasons. To provide competition between schools of

the  level  that  is  suggested  by  some  research  is  needed  to  get  some  modest  gains  would  be

prohibitively  expensive  in  New  Zealand  (and  other  systems  that  are  more  than  a  single  city  or

densely settled area), or it would entail major social and economic disruption.

Competition between schools does not enter an empty landscape, with all schools or families on

the same level, or all families. Competition does not seem able to change that landscape; it does

not  solve  or  improve,  and  indeed  probably  makes  somewhat  more  difficult,  the  provision  of

education  in  low  income  areas.  But  such  provision  is  one  of  the  key  educational  issues.  The

evidence  is  that  open  choice  as  it  is  in  New  Zealand  is  not  so  much  creating  as  cementing  a

situation where these schools will continue to struggle to preserve or extend programmes that will

provide rich education for students from low-income homes, because they find it harder to keep

those  who  may  show  more  motivation  towards  education, and  because  their  resourcing  is  more

precarious. In the Competent Children, Competent Learners study, motivation levels were much

lower among decile 1-2 students, and highest among decile 9-10 students. There were other signs

too of increased disengagement with school, and lower levels of parental satisfaction that pointed

to this group of schools facing issues that competition and choice on their own have not solved, or

made any easier (Wylie and Hipkins 2006).

Although  there  are  also  difficulties  with  the  enrolment  scheme  structure,  it  is  unlikely  to  shift

from  a  geographical  approach.  That  is  politically  too  difficult  (whether  one  was  approaching  it

from a “hands-off” extreme market approach, or a concern for social equality). The concept of the

school  as  a  community  focus,  if  not  fulcrum,  remains  strong  in  New  Zealand  (and  has  indeed

made  it  difficult  for  the  government  to  allocate  education  resources  more  efficiently  in  areas

where there is an oversupply of schools and places). There will continue to be those who cannot

access  schools  they  would  like  to  (as  in  any  system).  In  terms  of  trying  to  improve  access  to

higher decile schools for students in adjacent low income areas, there is obviously scope for fine-

Page 23 of 28

tuning,  and  for  government  to  look  carefully  at  enrolment  schemes  across  cities  with  this  in

mind.17 However, that does not provide a solution to the question of ensuring adequate provision

in low decile schools.

Until  the  late  1990s,  New  Zealand  relied  only  on  structural  competition  as  a  lever  for  school

improvement  and  innovation.  While  New  Zealand  state  and  integrated  schools  must  operate

within a national curriculum framework, it is a framework rather than a prescriptive scheme: there

is considerable latitude given to schools to decide what to teach, when, and how. Schools make

their  own  decisions  about  curriculum  resources,  including  textbooks.  They  can  also  make  their

own  decisions  about  which  assessments  they  will  use;  and  the  senior  qualifications  regime  also

provides  school-level  scope  for  deciding  what  mix  of  external  and  internal  assessments  to  use,

although external examinations continue to be seen as higher status (Hipkins and Vaughan 2005).

There is a limited amount of funding for schools to try out new approaches, for example, to use

project-based learning at secondary level, for which schools compete. Nonetheless, we have not

seen widespread innovation.

What  strikes  a  New  Zealand  researcher  about  the  examples  where  increased  diversity  or

specialisation  of  schools  has  occurred  alongside  increased  choice  is  that  these  examples  are  of

districts within wider systems; usually in urban areas where it is feasible for schools to specialise;

usually  where  districts  have  been  able  to  afford  the  additional  costs  (e.g.  transport;  increasing

school  capability);  and  where  there  is  in  fact  a  more  active  role  for  the  district  working  with

individual  self-managing  schools  than  we  have  in  New  Zealand.  The  legacy  of  the  “hands-off”

1990s makes that active role more difficult to work out now.

Hill (2005), as with others arguing for increased family choice, and the diversity of choice also

notes the cost of providing this, if it is to be done so that low income students benefit as much as

they need to. Indeed, he does not advocate so much a market, left to the suppliers, as it was in the

early-mid 1990s in New Zealand, but makes the case for public agencies to ensure that there is



17  Zones  are  not  used  in  England,  but  distance  between  a  child’s  home  and  the  preferred  school  is

usually  one  criterion,  as  is  siblingship.  In  their  recent  analysis  of  London  secondary  schools’

admissions criteria and practice Pennell, West, and Hind (2005) noted that there was still some partial

selection  on  the  basis  of  ability,  particularly  among  schools  that  were  responsible  for  their  own

admissions,  and  recommended  that  allocations  to  schools  should  not  be  made  this  way,  but  by  local

authorities  (as  in  the  choice  based  system  of  Sweden)  or  the  appropriate  local  level  organisation  for

faith-based  schools.  Comparing  existing  parental  satisfaction  rates  now  with  the  higher  rates  of  20

years  previously  in  London,  West  (2005)  also  argues  that  local  authority  allocation  on  the  basis  of

aiming to provide an even ability mix among the schools in its jurisdiction, as previously in London, is

fairer than either the use of distance alone, or school-based banding, and most likely to reduce social

segregation.

sufficient diversity of choice. Ouchi (2005) in his analysis of systems of effective districts based

on  autonomous  schools  demonstrates  the  importance  of  district  strategies  to  improve  capability

and support schools.

New Zealand started to move in this direction around 1997, when it became reasonably clear that

there  were  few  marked  gains  at  a  system  level,  and  particularly  in  low  income  areas.  The

government’s  first  moves  were  tentative  support  for  schools  in  difficulty  (often  in  low  income

areas), but then it started to taking the lead with carefully thought-out professional development

coupled  with  the  development  of  more  useful  assessment  resources:  none  of  which  could  be

created or disseminated by schools acting on their own, but which needed central leadership and

resourcing. More recently, it has been supporting professional learning communities, both within

and across schools.

This is interesting in light of the analyses by Levacic and Gibbons, who in going further than most

analysts of competition in education, and trying to understand why particular kinds of competition

appear  to  be  associated  with  positive  change,  point  to  the  role  of  professional  learning  from

colleagues. This is something also emphasised in studies of effective schools and districts.

The New Zealand government is also providing the basis for schools to make better use of better

formative assessment data, so that they can both diagnose and respond effectively to student needs

and  gaps.  Work  started  with  primary  schools,  and  in  the  last  couple  of  years,  shifted  into

secondary schools. This is a long-term strategy, that needs continued political support. There are

some  signs  that  it  is  beginning  to  pay  off  (e.g.  Higgins,  Irwin,  Thomas,  Trinick,  &  Young-Loveridge 2005).

For some, the lack of change in New Zealand would reflect a lack of accountability: schools are

not  being  held  up  to  the  fire  of  league  tables  or  the  fear  of  being  placed  in  ‘failing’  categories.

Levacic’s  cautionary  note  about  the  gaming  behaviour  that  can  ensue,  18  and  the  importance  of

having  inclusionary  measures  is  important.  There  is  also  continued  dispute  about  whether  the

English  approach  has  actually  raised  achievement,  and  improved  the  educational  outcomes  for

students from disadvantaged backgrounds, or simply raised performance on the visible measures.

In  New  Zealand,  perceptions  of  competition  do  not  seem  to  act  as  strong  drivers  to  improve

school  programmes  or  approaches.  The  signals  sent  by  competition  do  not  result  in  markedly

different approaches to provision. Student numbers matter for the sustainability or enrichment of

provision,  but  few  principals  are  interested  in  continuous  expansion.  Competition  may  not  be

needed as the spur its proponents believe. Educators’ desire to give their students as much as they

can, coupled with ensuring that they have the ability to do so effectively, are likely to have more

effect.
