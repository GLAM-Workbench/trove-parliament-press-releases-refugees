OPENING OF THE NATIONAL ETHNIC HEALTH POLICY CONFERENCE

\

"HEALTH POLICY IN A MULTICULTURAL AUSTRALIA

- TOWARDS A NATIONAL AGENDA"

BY THE COMMONWALTH MINISTER FOR COMMUNITY

SERVICES AND HEALTH, THE HON. DR NEAL BLEWETT MP

ADELAIDE

APRIL 13, 1988

DISTINGUISHED GUESTS, CONFERENCE PARTICIPANTS:

THIS CONFERENCE IS AN INTEGRAL COMPONENT OF THE FORMULATION AND

IMPLEMENTATION OF AUSTRALIA'S HEALTHY PUBLIC POLICY.

YOUR DISCUSSIONS, AND THE RECOMMENDATIONS AND ACTIONS WHICH WILL

FLOW FROM THEM, ARE AN ESSENTIAL PREREQUISITE TO OUR SUCCESSFUL

PURSUIT OF THIS NATION'S NEW HEALTH GOALS.

THESE GOALS ARE CONTAINED IN THE "HEALTH FOR ALL AUSTRALIANS"

BLUEPRINT WHICH I RELEASED LAST WEEK AT THE SECOND INTERNATIONAL

CONFERENCE ON HEALTHY PUBLIC POLICY HERE IN ADELAIDE.

THE CORNERSTONE OF THAT INITIATIVE - ONE OF THE BOLDEST GLOBAL

HEALTH INITIATIVES EVER TAKEN ANYWHERE - IS NOT ONLY TO PROVIDE

REAL AND EQUAL ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE SERVICES TO ALL

AUSTRALIANS, BUT ALSO TO REDRESS THE SOMETIMES ENORMOUS

IMBALANCES IN THE HEALTH STATUS OF THE DIFFERENT AND DIVERSE

GROUPS WITHIN OUR COMMUNITY.

e e s - i e i e e

2.

CLEARLY, THE FULFILMENT OF THE HEALTH NEEDS AND DEMANDS OF

PEOPLE OF MIGRANT DESCENT IS A VITAL STEP IN THE REALISATION OF

THE GOALS AND TARGETS ENSHRINED IN "HEALTH FOR ALL AUSTRALIANS".

THE FACTS THAT ONE IN EVERY FIVE AUSTRALIANS WAS BORN OVERSEAS;

THAT OVER TEN PERCENT OF OUR POPULATION ARE OF NON-ENGLISH

SPEAKING BACKGROUNDS, AND THAT A FURTHER 24 PERCENT OF PEOPLE

BORN HERE HAVE AT LEAST ONE PARENT WHO WAS BORN OVERSEAS

DEMONSTRATE UNEQUIVOCALLY THE SIGNIFICANCE OF A SUCCESSFUL

ETHNIC HEALTH POLICY.

THESE DEMOGRAPHICS SHOW THAT THE PROVISION OF HEALTH CARE

SERVICES TO, AND THE MAINTENANCE OF HEALTH STATUS AMONG PEOPLE

OF ETHNIC BACKGROUNDS CANNOT AND MUST NOT BE ADDRESSED IN

ISOLATION FROM THE HEALTH NEEDS OF OTHER AUSTRALIANS.

ETHNIC HEALTH CANNOT BE COMPARTMENTALISED,  ROPED OFF AS A

SEPARATE ENTITY AND DEALT WITH AS A UNIQUE AND UNRELATED ISSUE.

GONE ARE THE DAYS WHEN HEALTH CARE PLANNERS,  ADMINISTRATORS AND

SERVICE DELIVERERS COULD SIMPLY TACK ON NEW ADJUNCTS TO THEIR

SYSTEM TO PROVIDE FOR THE.NEEDS OF ETHNIC AUSTRALIANS, WITHOUT

ATTEMPTING TO RESHAPE THE FORM OF THE SYSTEM ITSELF.

e e s - i e i Â· Â»

WE NOW ACCEPT THAT IT SHOULD NOT BE UP TO ETHNIC HEALTH

CONSUMERS TO STRUGGLE TO OVERCOME THE OFTEN AWESOME BARRIERS TO

THEIR ACCESS TO MAINSTREAM SERVICES; THAT IT IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH

FOR THESE AUSTRALIANS TO HAVE THEIR HEALTH NEEDS CONSIDERED IN

THE CONTEXT OF EXTRAS OR ADD-ONS TO THE EXISTING PUBLIC HEALTH

SYSTEM.

NOW, WE EXPECT THAT THE SYSTEM ITSELF MUST CHANGE IF WE ARE TO

GUARANTEE EQUALITY OF ACCESS TO ALL AUSTRALIANS.

THESE CHANGES IN APPROACH ARE BEING FORGED BY THIS FEDERAL

GOVERNMENT'S PHILOSPHICAL AND FINANCIAL COMMITMENT TO THE BELIEF

THAT GOOD HEALTH IS EVERY INDIVIDUAL'S MOST PRECIOUS POSSESSION,

AND THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO BARRIERS TO ITS PROTECTION.

WE BELIEVE THAT EVERY AUSTRALIAN IS EQUALLY ENTITLED TO ACCESS

TO THE BEST HEALTH CARE, REGARDLESS OF ABILITY TO PAY, ORIGIN,

OR ANY OTHER FACTOR.

AND WE BELIEVE THAT EVERY AUSTRALIAN IS EQUALLY ENTITLED TO HAVE

ACCESS TO THE INFORMATION AND EDUCATION WHICH WILL ENABLE THEM

TO PROTECT AND IMPROVE THEIR HEALTH.

PROVIDING EQUALITY OF ACCESS TO HEALTH SERVICES WAS THE HIGHEST

PRIORITY OF THIS FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WHEN ELECTED TO OFFICE.

3.

c o t - i e i e Â»

WE TOOK A MAJOR STEP IN THIS DIRECTION WITH THE INTRODUCTION IN

FEBRUARY, 1984, OF OUR UNIVERSAL HEALTH INSURANCE SCHEME,

MEDICARE.

MEDICARE IS DESIGNED TO ENSURE THAT ALL AUSTRALIANS HAVE ACCESS

TO MEDICAL AND HOSPITAL CARE AT MINIMAL OR NO COST.

PEOPLE COMING TO AUSTRALIA AND PLANNING TO STAY FOR A MINIMUM OF

SIX MONTHS ARE IMMEDIATELY ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICARE COVER.

THIS GOVERNMENT IS ALSO IN THE PROCESS OF NEGOTIATING A NUMBER

OF RECIPROCAL HEALTH CARE AGREEMENTS WITH COUNTRIES FROM WHICH

LARGE ETHNIC POPULATIONS HAVE SETTLED IN AUSTRALIA OR WHERE

THERE IS A SUFFICIENT EXCHANGE OF SHORT TERM VISITORS.

THE RECIPROCAL AGREEMENTS ARE DESIGNED TO PROVIDE ACCESS TO THE

RESPECTIVE COUNTRIES' HEALTH CARE SCHEMES FOR SHORT TERM

VISITORS EITHER TO OR FROM AUSTRALIA.

SO FAR, AGREEMENTS HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED WITH THE UNITED KINGDOM

AND NEW ZEALAND.

I HAVE SIGNED AN AGREEMENT WITH ITALY, WHICH IS AWAITING

RATIFICATION BY THE ITALIAN PARLIAMENT.

4 Â·

CO I- 10 7 Â· Â· .

AGREEMENTS WITH MALTA AND SWEDEN HAVE BEEN FINALISED AND

HOPEFULLY WILL BE SIGNED WITHIN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS. I AM ALSO

INFORMED THAT AN AGREEMENT WITH YUGOSLAVIA SHOULD BE FINALISED

IN THIS FINANCIAL YEAR, WHILE THE GOVERNMENTS OF PORTUGAL AND

DENMARK HAVE APPROACHED US ABOUT NEGOTIATING SIMILAR AGREEMENTS.

IT IS MY INTENTION TO EXPAND THE NETWORK OF AGREEMENTS WHERE

APPROPRIATE, AS I BELIEVE THAT SUCH ARRANGEMENTS ARE NOT ONLY

MORE CONVENIENT FOR TOURISTS, BUT ALSO STRENGTHEN AUSTRALIA'S  7

TIES WITH THE COUNTRIES INVOLVED.

THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT RECIPROCAL AGREEMENTS WILL BE OF SPECIAL

BENEFIT TO AUSTRALIAN ETHNIC GROUPS, PARTICULARLY AS THEY RELATE

TO VISITS FOR FAMILY REUNION PURPOSES.

I WOULD EMPHASISE THAT RECIPROCAL HEALTH CARE AGREEMENTS ARE

ONLY POSSIBLE WITH COUNTRIES WITH COMPARABLE HEALTH CARE

SYSTEMS.

INDEED, IN AUSTRALIA'S CASE, THESE AGREEMENTS ONLY BECAME

POSSIBLE WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF MEDICARE AND ANY THREAT TO THE

UNIVERSALITY OF OUR HEALTH INSURANCE SYSTEM WOULD BE A THREAT TO

THE EXISTENCE OF THE AGREEMENTS.

5.

c o e - i e i Â· Â»

WHILE WE BELIEVE THAT ISSUES OF EQUITY AND ACCESS MUST BE

STANDARDISED FOR ALL AUSTRALIANS, WE DO, OF COURSE, RECOGNISE

THAT WITHIN THESE COMMITMENTS, THE KINDS OF SERVICES AVAILABLE

WITHIN THE HEALTH SYSTEM MUST BE AS DIVERSE AS THE POPULATION

ITSELF.

THUS, THE OVERALL THEME OF THIS CONFERENCE - HEALTH POLICY IN A

MULTICULTURAL AUSTRALIA: TOWARDS A NATIONAL AGENDA - IS

UNDERWRITTEN BY THREE BASIC AIMS.

.  TO SHARE INFORMATION; THERE IS A NEED TO FACILITATE

INFORMATION SHARING ON ISSUES, CURRENT PROGRAMS AND

SERVICES, AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS;

.  TO CLARIFY ISSUES IN MULTICULTURAL HEALTH; THAT IS, TO

CLEARLY IDENTIFY AND ARTICULATE THE HEALTH ISSUES PERTINENT

TO ALL GROUPS IN OUR SOCIETY; AND

.  TO RECOMMEND POLICIES AND PRIORITIES FOR A NATIONAL AGENDA

FOR HEALTH IN A MULTICULTURAL SOCIETY.

TO DISCUSS THESE IMPORTANT SUBJECTS, THE NATIONAL ETHNIC HEALTH

COMMITTEE HAS DRAWN TOGETHER A PLETHORA OF PEOPLE WITH EXPERTISE

IN ETHNIC HEALTH POLICY DEVELOPMENT AND SERVICE DELIVERY TO

PARTICIPATE IN THIS CONFERENCE.

6.

C0t-i07Â·Â·

THIS MEETING IS A JOINT VENTURE OF THE COMMONWEALTH, STATES AND

TERRITORIES, AND THE OFFICE OF MULTICULTURAL AFFAIRS,

RECOGNISING THAT WHILE SERVICE DELIVERY IS ESSENTIALLY A MATTER

FOR STATE AUTHORITIES, THE NEED FOR A NATIONALLY COORDINATED AND

CONSISTENT ETHNIC HEALTH POLICY IS OF PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE.

AT THIS POINT, I THINK IT IS APPROPRIATE THAT I SAY A FEW WORDS

ABOUT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S APPROACH TO MULTICULTURALISM.

A MULTICULTURAL SOCIETY IS NOT SIMPLY A WAY OF DESCRIBING A

COMMUNITY MARKED BY ETHNIC, CULTURAL OR LINGUISTIC DIVERSITY,

ALTHOUGH AUSTRALIA CERTAINLY FITS THAT DEFINITION.

RATHER, A GENUINELY MULTICULTURAL SOCIETY IS ONE IN WHICH SUCH

DIVERSITY IS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH INTOLERANCE,  INEQUALITY OR

INEFFICIENCY.

IN OTHER WORDS,  MULTICULTURALISM AS A PUBLIC POLICY HAS THREE

DIMENSIONS - RESPECT FOR CULTURAL DIFFERENCE, PROMOTION OF

SOCIAL JUSTICE, AND PURSUIT OF ECONOMIC EFFICIENCY.

THE CULTURAL MAINTENANCE AND SOCIAL JUSTICE DIMENSIONS OF

MULTICULTURAL!SM ARE RELATIVELY EASILY UNDERSTOOD. PUT SIMPLY,

COMFORMITY TO A PARTICULAR CULTURAL STEREOTYPE SHOULD NOT BE THE

PRICE DEMANDED IN RETURN FOR EQUALITY, EQUITY OR PARTICIPATION.

7.

c e e - i o i Â· Â»

IN A MULTICULTURAL AUSTRALIA, IT IS UNACCEPTABLE FOR RIGHTS TO

BE FORFEITED BECAUSE OF DIFFERENCE.  ALL AUSTRALIANS, NO MATTER

WHAT THEIR ETHNIC ORIGIN, ARE ENTITLED TO A FAIR SHARE OF OUR

COMMON RESOURCES, AND A FAIR GO IN SOCIETY.

THE ECONOMIC DIMENSION OF MULT I CULTURAL ISM IS LESS WELL

UNDERSTOOD.  IT MEANS THAT THE COMMUNITY SHOULD SEEK TO MAKE

MAXIMUM EFFECTIVE USE OF ALL ITS HUMAN RESOURCES, PARTICULARLY

IN AUSTRALIA'S CURRENT ECONOMIC CIRCUMSTANCES.

TO TREAT A PROPORTION OF THE POPULATION UNEQUALLY - WHETHER BY

DISCRIMINATION, NEGLECT, IGNORANCE OR INSENSITIVITY - IS TO

WASTE HUMAN RESOURCES. TO GET THE BEST OUT OF OUR ECONOMY, WE

MUST UTILIZE ALL OUR AVAILABLE TALENT AT ITS OPTIMUM LEVEL.

A PARTICULAR EXAMPLE OF WHAT I MEAN IN THE FIELD OF HEALTH

POLICY IS THE RECOGNITION OF OVERSEAS QUALIFICATIONS. IT IS

POINTLESS TO SELECT IMMIGRANTS ON THE BASIS OF THEIR SKILLS - OR

TO ADMIT SKILLED IMMIGRANTS FOR WHATEVER REASON - AND THEN TO

IGNORE AND WASTE THOSE SKILLS. YET, I AM CONVINCED THAT AS A

NATION WE WASTE SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES IN THIS WAY.

8.

ÃÂ¿ÃÂ¿Â·-ÃÂ¹ÃÂ²ÃÂ¹Â·Ã’

IT IS FOR THESE REASONS THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS INCLUDED IN THE

REFERENCE OF THE INQUIRY INTO MEDICAL EDUCATION AND THE MEDICAL

WORKFORCE EXAMINATION OF THE NEED TO VARY OVERSEAS ENTRANTS'

REQUIREMENTS.

THE LESSON IS CLEAR. WHEN WE SPEAK ABOUT MULTICULTURALISM, WE

ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT MERELY QUAINT RITUALS AND EXOTIC CUISINE.

WE ARE TALKING ABOUT SOCIAL JUSTICE AND ECONOMIC EFFICIENCY -

ABOUT DOING THE RIGHT THING BY THE INDIVIDUAL AND THE RIGHT

THING BY AUSTRALIA.

IN THE.PROCESS, WE ARE ALSO CHALLENGING SOME OF THE ESTABLISHED

BASTIONS OF POWER AND PRIVILEGE WITHIN OUR COMMUNITY.

MULTICULTURALISM IS NO LUXURY. IT IS A NECESSITY.

AND THE SUCCESS OF OUR CHALLENGES IN THESE AREAS WILL, TO A

LARGE DEGREE,  DICTATE THE EXTENT TO WHICH WE WILL BE ABLE TO

ASPIRE TO OUR NATIONAL HEALTH TARGETS.

9.

C 0 9 - 1 0 7 V 8

THE GOALS SET BY "HEALTH FOR ALL AUSTRALIANS" FOR MIGRANTS ARE:

.  ONE, TO ENSURE THAT THE HEALTH ADVANTAGE OF MIGRANTS ON

ARRIVAL IN AUSTRALIA IS NOT ERODED BY THE ADOPTION OF LESS

HEALTH LIFESTYLES OR ENVIRONMENTS, AND

.  TWO, TO ENSURE THAT THE SPECIAL HEALTH NEEDS OF REFUGEES ON

ARRIVAL IN AUSTRALIA ARE MET.

TOUCHING ON THE LATTER MATTER FIRST, IT IS PERHAPS STATING THE

OBVIOUS THAT THE ISSUES OF LANGUAGE AND CULTURAL BARRIERS TO

HEALTH CARE DEMAND YOUR ATTENTION AS AN IMPLICIT PRIORITY.

SEEKING HEALTH CARE CAN BE A TRAUMATIC AND TRYING EXPERIENCE FOR

ALL OF US, REGARDLESS OF OUR ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY COMMUNICATE

WITH OUR DOCTOR OR OTHER HEALTH PROFESSIONALS.

AND WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT FOR PEOPLE WHOSE COMMUNICATION SKILLS

ARE IMPEDED BY LANGUAGE DIFFICULTIES OR A SENSE OF ALIENATION

FROM THE HEALTH SYSTEM, THESE FEELINGS ARE SOMETIMES COMPOUNDED

TO THE POINT OF TOTAL FRUSTRATION, IF NOT EXCLUSION.

THUS, WE NOT ONLY HAVE TO BE ABLE TO ASSIST MIGRANTS TO WORK OUT

HOW TO ACCESS HEALTH CARE SERVICES, BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO MAKE

THEM FEEL AS COMFORTABLE AS POSSIBLE WHEN THEY GET THERE.

1 0 Â·

c o s - i e i t i

FOSTERING SUCH A SENSE OF COMFORT OR FAMILIARITY INVOLVES MUCH

MORE THAN BREAKING DOWN THE OBVIOUS BARRIERS OF LANGUAGE

DIFFERENCES.

PEOPLE WHO SPEAK THE SAME LANGUAGE ARE FREQUENTLY UNABLE TO

COMMUNICATE EFFECTIVELY, PARTICULARLY IF THEY FEEL INHIBITED,

THREATENED OR ILL-AT-EASE.

AND IT IS THE REMOVAL OF THE FEELINGS OF INHIBITIONS AND

DISCOMFORT WHICH ARE OFTEN PROMPTED BY CULTURAL DIFFERENCES OR

MISUNDERSTANDINGS WITH WHICH WE MUST BE CONCERNED.

IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF POLICIES ON THIS MATTER, AS IN OTHER

AREAS, I BELIEVE THAT HEALTH PLANNERS MUST NOT ONLY APPRECIATE,

BUT THINK MULTICULTURALISM IN ALL OF THEIR ENDEAVOURS.

AS A COMPONENT OF THIS PROCESS, I SUPPORT THE INVOLVEMENT OF

CONSUMERS IN HEALTH PLANNING AND I HAVE ENCOURAGED COMMUNITY

PARTICIPATION ON COMMITTEES WHERE POSSIBLE. ' *

I BELIEVE THAT AUSTRALIAN MIGRANTS AND THEIR FAMILIES SHOULD BE

INVOLVED AT A RESPONSIBLE DECISION-MAKING LEVEL IN HEALTH CARE,

AND THE FEDERATION OF ETHNIC COMMUNITIES COUNCILS HAS BEEN

IDENTIFIED AS ONE OF THE CORE BODIES TO PROVIDE THIS

11Â·

REPRESENTATION.

c e e - i o i Â· Â»

THE FEDERATION'S REPRESENTATION ON THE GENERAL COMMITTEE OF THE

CONSUMERS' HEALTH FORUM HAS ALREADY ENSURED ETHNIC GROUPS'

PARTICIPATION AND ADVOCACY.

EQUALLY, THE MAJORITY OF THE AGED CARE ADVOCACY COMMITTEES ’

ESTABLISHED IN EACH STATE HAVE APPOINTED MEMBERS ABLE TO

REPRESENT THE VIEWS OF ETHNIC COMMUNITIES. -

SUCH "GRASS-ROOTS" COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION IS ALSO INVALUABLE IN

THE COLLECTION OF DATA.

BECAUSE THE DEMANDS OF ETHNIC COMMUNITIES FOR PARTICULAR HEALTH

SERVICES VARY GEOGRAPHICALLY OVER TIME, AND WITH THE CHANGING

COMPOSITION OF OUR IMMIGRANT INTAKE, IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PLAN

ADEQUATELY USING ONLY NATIONAL OR STATE LEVEL DATA.

REGIONAL AND LOCAL SERVICES MUST BECOME AWARE OF THEIR CONSUMER

POPULATIONS AND IDENTIFY THEIR HEALTH NEEDS.

GOVERNMENTS AND SERVICE PROVIDERS AT ALL LEVELS WILL NEED TO

COORDINATE THEIR EFFORTS IN A COMPREHENSIVE ASSAULT TO MEET THE

CHALLENGE CREATED BY THE COMPLEX AND CHANGING PATTERNS OF DEMAND.

12.

c o i - i t m

THESE MATTERS ARE RELEVANT BOTH TO THIS CONFERENCE AND IN THE

CONTEXT OF THE AUSTRALIAN BUREAU OF STATISTICS' PLANNING FOR THE

1989-90 NATIONAL HEALTH SURVEY AND THE 1991 NATIONAL POPULATION

CENSUS.

WE MUST ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE - AND DISPEL - THE MYTHS AND

MISCONCEPTIONS WHICH EXIST IN AUSTRALIA ABOUT THE HEALTH OF

ETHNIC GROUPS AND HOW IT RELATES TO THE NATION'S OVERALL HEALTH

STATUS.

THE FACT THAT THE HEALTH OF MIGRANTS TO AUSTRALIA IS GENERALLY

CONSIDERED TO BE OF A HIGHER STANDARD THAN THAT OF SECOND AND

THIRD GENERATION AUSTRALIANS CLEARLY INDICATES THAT THERE IS

MUCH THAT ALL OF OUR SOCIETY CAN LEARN FROM A THOROUGH .

EXAMINATION OF THESE TRENDS.

AND THE FACT THAT THE GENERALLY HIGHER STANDARD OF HEALTH OF OUR

MIGRANT POPULATIONS TENDS TO DECLINE UNDER THE AUSTRALIAN

INFLUENCE OFFERS EQUAL POTENTIAL FOR CLOSER SCRUTINY AND

UNDERSTANDING.

FOR EXAMPLE, EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES OF AUSTRALIA'S ETHNIC

POPULATION REVEAL THAT MORTALITY RATES FOR CORONARY ARTERY

DISEASE AMONG MIGRANTS FROM SOUTHERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES

PARTICULARLY ARE APPROXIMATELY HALF THE NATIONAL AVERAGE.

13.

cee-veiÂ·Â·

14.

HOWEVER, STUDIES, SUCH AS THAT OF CHRISTOBEL YOUNG, INDICATE THE

RELATIVE RISK OF DEATH FROM CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE RISES FOR

THESE GROUPS THE LONGER THEY HAVE LIVED IN AUSTRALIA.

THUS, WHILE OVER THE PAST DECADE THERE HAS BEEN A FALL OF

APPROXIMATELY 40 PERCENT OVERALL IN CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE FOR

AUSTRALIANS GENERALLY, A NUMBER OF ETHNIC COMMUNITIES HAVE NOT -

PARTICIPATED IN THIS FALL AND, IN FACT, HAVE SUFFERED RISING

LEVELS OF DISEASE.

THE PROGRESSIVE ADOPTION OF AUSTRALIAN LIFESTYLE, DIET AND

EXERCISE PATTERNS BY MIGRANTS HAS BEEN BLAMED FOR THIS

PHENOMENON.

SIMPLY, TWO IMPORTANT MESSAGES CAN BE DRAWN HERE:

- HEALTH SERVICES NEED TO EXAMINE THE WHOLE PICTURE BEFORE

THEY DETERMINE POLICIES FOR EQUITY IN HEALTH; AND

- AUSTRALIANS CAN GAIN FROM THE LIFESTYLES, DIET AND ACTIVITY

PATTERNS OF MANY ETHNIC COMMUNITIES. TO SOME EXTENT THEY

HAVE ALREADY DONE SO.

C 0 9 - 1 0 7 Â· Â»

AS MANY OF YOU WILL KNOW, AUSTRALIA IS ALREADY WITNESSING AND

PARTICIPATING IN A UNIQUELY IMPRESSIVE HEALTH PROMOTION AND

DISEASE PREVENTION PROGRAMME WHICH REFLECTS THE WORLD HEALTH

ORGANISATION'S DEFINITION OF HEALTH AS NOT MERELY BEING THE

ABSENCE OF DISEASE, BUT ALSO THE ATTAINMENT OF PHYSICAL, MENTAL

AND SOCIAL WELLBEING.

IT IS IMPORTANT THAT ALL GROUPS IN OUR SOCIETY SHARE IN AND

BENEFIT FROM THIS ENLIGHTENED AND PROGRESSIVE INITIATIVE.

THE BETTER HEALTH COMMISSION'S CONSULTATION STRESSED THE AREAS I

HAVE ALREADY MENTIONED, AS WELL AS THE NEED FOR GREATER

APPRECIATION OF THE SPECIAL HEALTH NEEDS OF THE ETHNIC AGED.

THIS LAST AREA, THE ETHNIC AGED, IS ONE IN WHICH THE GOVERNMENT

IS ALREADY UNDERTAKING EXTENSIVE INITIATIVES. HAVING RECOGNISED

THE LIMITED ACCESS OF THE AGED IN ETHNIC COMMUNITIES TO

APPROPRIATE AGED CARE SERVICES, WE ESTABLISHED AN

INTERDEPARTMENTAL ETHNIC AGED WORKING PARTY TO CONSULT WIDELY

WITH THE ETHNIC AGED, THEIR REPRESENTATIVES, AND SERVICE

PROVIDERS.

FROM THIS INTENSIVE AND OPEN PROCESS EMERGED A CLEARLY

ENUNCIATED SET OF PRINCIPLES TO GUIDE THE PROVISION OF SERVICES

TO THE ETHNIC AGED. A SET OF BROAD AND PROGRAM SPECIFIC

15.

RECOMMENDATIONS WERE MADE.

coe-ieiÂ«B

THE COMPREHENSIVE OUTCOME OF THIS COMMITTEE' S WORK WAS ENDORSED

BY THE GOVERNMENT, RESULTING IN A COMMITMENT OF SOME $40 MILLION

TO BE SPENT ON ETHNIC SPECIFIC AGED SERVICES BY 1990.

WITHIN THIS PROJECT, THE PARTICULAR NEEDS OF THE ETHNIC AGED

NEEDED TO BE IDENTIFIED, UNDERSTOOD AND ADDRESSED.

FOR EXAMPLE,  WHEREAS THE AUSTRALIAN COMMUNITY IS OVERPROVIDED

WITH NURSING HOME BEDS, ETHNIC COMMUNITIES ARE SERIOUSLY

UNDER-PROVIDED. A MAJOR COMPONENT OF OUR STRATEGY IS TO SEEK

THE CONVERSION OF EXISTING GENERAL NURSING HOME BEDS TO ETHNIC

SPECIFIC FACILITIES.

BY COMPARISON, THE WHOLE COMMUNITY, INCLUDING ETHNIC

COMMUNITIES, IS UNDER-RESOURCED IN HOSTELS FOR THE AGED. IN

SEEKING MAJOR GROWTH IN THE HOSTEL AREA, WE ARE ABLE TO ENSURE

THAT THE NEEDS OF ETHNIC GROUPS IN THIS AREA WILL BE MET.

I AM HEARTENED BY ADVICE THAT THE REQUIREMENT FROM THE ETHNIC

AGED WORKING PARTY TO COMMIT $8 MILLION IN 1986/87 TO ETHNIC

SPECIFIC HOSTELS AND NURSING HOMES HAS NOT ONLY BEEN MET, BUT

SURPASSED, WITH AN EXPENDITURE COMMITMENT OF NEARLY $9 MILLION.

16.

e o i - i e m

17.

THERE HAVE ALSO BEEN OTHER MAJOR INNOVATIONS UNDERTAKEN. THIS

GOVERNMENT LEGISLATED LAST YEAR TO CHANGE THE AGED OR DISABLED

PERSONS HOMES ACT (1954) TO ENABLE, FOR THE FIRST TIME, UP TO

100 PER CENT CAPITAL FUNDING TO BE PROVIDED TO THE FINANCIALLY

DISADVANTAGED WHO HAVE BEEN LIMITED IN THEIR ACCESS TO AGED CARE

SERVICES.

Ã¢ÂÂ   ' Ã¢ÂÂ   -Â·Â· l.  .

THE PRIME GROUP FOR WHOM THIS LEGISLATIVE AMENDMENT WAS ENACTED

WAS THE AGED IN ETHNIC COMMUNITIES.

LATER THIS YEAR, WE WILL BE PROCLAIMING FURTHER LEGISLATIVE

AMENDMENTS TO ALLOW FOR VARIABLE CAPITAL FUNDING OF HOSTELS.

THIS WILL ENABLE THE MORE EFFECTIVE USE OF AVAILABLE RESOURCES

TO BETTER SERVICE THOSE CURRENTLY DISADVANTAGED IN THEIR ACCESS

TO EXISTING SERVICES, INCLUDING THE AGED IN ETHNIC COMMUNITIES.

FOR THE ETHNIC AGED WHO ARE SUPPORTED IN RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES,

WE HAVE PROVIDED IN OUR RECENTLY DEVELOPED NURSING HOME

STANDARDS:  "LIVING IN A NURSING HOME”,  PROVISIONS TO ENSURE

FREEDOM TO PRACTISE RELIGIOUS OR CULTURAL CUSTOMS.

WE HAVE ALSO RECOGNISED THAT MANY OF THE AGED IN ETHNIC

COMMUNITIES WISH TO AND CAN BE SUPPORTED AT HOME BY APPROPRIATE

ETHNIC SPECIFIC SERVICES. THE ETHNIC AGED WORKING PARTY REPORT

MADE PROVISION FOR THIS, EARMARKING OVER ONE MILLION DOLLARS TO

PILOT A NUMBER OF ETHNIC SPECIFIC COMMUNITY OPTIONS PROJECTS,

SOME OF WHICH HAVE ALREADY COMMENCED.

18.

THIS IS NOT TO SAY WE HAVE SOLVED THE PROBLEMS OF ACCESS AND

EQUITY FOR THE AGED IN ETHNIC COMMUNITIES. RATHER IT EVIDENCES

OUR COMMITMENT TO WORK, AND TO WORK QUICKLY AND EFFECTIVELY TO

CHANGE FOR THE BETTER.

THIS MAJOR PROJECT PROVIDES A CO-ORDINATED AND PUBLIC FRAMEWORK

TO ENABLE POLICY MAKERS, SERVICE PROVIDERS AND ETHNIC

COMMUNITIES, TOGETHER WITH THEIR AGED TO OVERCOME EXISTING

BARRIERS.

GIVEN THE RANGE OF DIFFERENT GROUPS IN OUR SOCIETY, AND THEIR

DIVERSE NEEDS,  THERE IS NO SINGLE SOLUTION TO ENSURING THE

BARRIERS TO APPROPRIATE HEALTH CARE ARE MITIGATED OR OVERCOME.

TO SUPPORT THE INITIATIVES OF INDIVIDUAL WORKERS OR PROGRAMS,

AND, IMPORTANTLY, PROVIDE IMMEDIATE AND ON-GOING SUPPORT TO

SEPARATE INITIATIVES AND BROAD STRATEGIES WHICH WILL EMERGE FROM

THIS CONFERENCE, THE FEDERAL LABOR GOVERNMENT HAS COMMITTED ALL

COMMONWEALTH SERVICE PROVIDERS AND PLANNERS TO THE PRINCIPLES OF

ACCESS-AND-EQUITY FOR MIGRANTS AND THEIR FAMILIES.

THIS IS AN OUTSTANDING POLICY ACHIEVEMENT WHICH HAS IMPACTED

BENEFICIALLY ON HEALTH SERVICES, STIMULATING THEM TO BE

EVER-CONSCIOUS AND RESPONSIVE TO THE NEEDS OF OUR MULTICULTURAL

(.

POPULATION.

cee-ieisÂ»

19.

THE GOVERNMENT AND MY DEPARTMENT ARE ALSO DETERMINED TO ENSURE

THAT HEALTH MESSAGES REACH ETHNIC TARGET POPULATIONS.

WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE CONCEPTS OF LIFESTYLE DISEASE PREVENTION

AND HEALTH PROMOTION ARE NEW AND THEIR VALUE NOT ALWAYS EASILY

AND SPEEDILY APPRECIATED.

.  !  '  ÃÂ» j.v'2

IT IS UP TO HEALTH ADMINISTRATORS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE

UNDOUBTED VALUE OF OUR HEALTH MESSAGES IS NOT EMASCULATED BY

COMMUNITY REJECTION, DISINTEREST OR DISLIKE.

IN THIS REGARD, MY DEPARTMENT HAS RECENTLY CREATED AN ETHNIC

HEALTH LIAISON POSITION TO WORK WITH OFFICERS PLANNING TO

UNDERTAKE MAJOR MEDIA HEALTH PROMOTIONS.

I AM CONFIDENT THAT THIS WILL CONTRIBUTE TO THE FORMULATION AND

DISSEMINATION OF MORE CULTURALLY AND LINGUISTICALLY RELEVANT

HEALTH PROMOTION MESSAGES TO ETHNIC GROUPS. '

THAT IS NOT TO SAY THAT THE MAJOR INVOLVEMENT OF ETHNIC

COMMUNITIES HAS BEEN WANTING IN RECENT GOVERNMENT HEALTH

PROGRAMMES, SUCH AS AIDS AND THE DRUG OFFENSIVE.

eee-ÃÂ¹ÃÂ²ÃÂ¹Â·Â»

FOR EXAMPLE, MY DEPARTMENT'S AIDS CAMPAIGN HAS INVOLVED:

- DISTRIBUTION TO STATE HEALTH DEPARTMENTS, INDIVIDUALS AND

COMMUNITY ORGANISATIONS, TRANSLATED COPIES OF "AIDS - YOUR

QUESTIONS ANSWERED".  -

- AS PART OF THE GRIM REAPER CAMPAIGN, A PRESS LAUNCH OF THE

AIDS EDUCATION CAMPAIGN FOR ETHNIC AUSTRALIANS. COMMUNITY

LEADERS, JOURNALISTS AND EDITORS WORKING IN THE ETHNIC MEDIA

WERE INVITED TO ATTEND THIS LAUNCH.

- BROADCASTING AIDS MESSAGES TRANSLATED INTO FIFTY EIGHT

COMMUNITY LANGUAGES THROUGH RADIO 2EA AND 3EA AND 24 OTHER

PUBLIC BROADCASTING STATIONS.

- THE AIDS BROCHURE "TEN QUESTIONS AND NINE ANSWERS" WAS

TRANSLATED INTO NINE LANGUAGES AND ADVERTISED IN MAJOR

ETHNIC NEWSPAPERS ACROSS AUSTRALIA.

- FUNDING OF ETHNIC LINE FOR AN AIDS COUNSELLING SERVICE AND

FOR AN INTERSTATE "008" TELEPHONE LINE.

- INFORMATION MAILOUT TO ETHNIC COMMUNITIES COUNCILS AS PART

OF THE "GRIM REAPER CAMPAIGN"; AND

- PROVIDING PRE-RECORDED INFORMATION ON AIDS THROUGH THE

TELEPHONE INTERPRETER SERVICE.

20.

C O t - 1 0 7 Â·Ã’

IN CLOSING, I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE CONFERENCE ORGANISERS AND

THOSE WHO ARE CONTRIBUTING THROUGH THE PRESENTATION OF PAPERS.

I AM IMPRESSED NOT ONLY BY THE COMPREHENSIVE COVERAGE OF THE

ISSUES BUT ALSO BY THE NUMBER AND EXCELLENCE OF PRESENTERS. Â· "

.  ,V Â·.

IN THE EARLY STAGES OF PLANNING, I AM TOLD, THERE WAS SOME

APPREHENSION ABOUT THE RANGE AND QUALITY OF PAPERS WHICH WOULD

BE FORTHCOMING, BUT, AS THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE CONFERENCE

BECAME APPARENT THROUGHOUT AUSTRALIA, THE ORGANISERS SOON

REALISED HOW MUCH SERIOUS WORK WAS BEING UNDERTAKEN IN THE FIELD

OF ETHNIC HEALTH AND HOW UNNECESSARY WERE THEIR DOUBTS.

IT IS PARTICULARLY PLEASING TO SEE THAT PAPERS ARE BEING

PRESENTED ON THE CANADIAN EXPERIENCE AND I WELCOME PROFESSOR

OLIVIO VISANO AND DOCTOR ROBERT DOYLE FROM TORONTO, CANADA.

I CONGRATULATE THE MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL ETHNIC HEALTH

COMMITTEE AND WOULD LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE VITAL SUPPORT AND

CO-SPONSORSHIP OFFERED BY THE SOUTH AUSTRALIAN HEALTH *?Ã¢ÂÂ  Ã¢ÂÂ

COMMISSION, THE OFFICE OF MULTICULTURAL AFFAIRS,  THE ILLAWARRA

HEALTH REGION OF NEW SOUTH WALES AND MY OWN DEPARTMENT OF

COMMUNITY SERVICES AND HEALTH.

21.

22

FINALLY, I WOULD LIKE TO REITERATE THE ENORMOUS SIGNIFICANCE

WHICH I AND THE GOVERNMENT PLACE ON THIS CONFERENCE AND ON THE

FURTHER IMPROVEMENT OF ETHNIC HEALTH POLICY AND, THUS, THE

AUSTRALIAN HEALTH STATUS.

WE LOOK TO YOU, THE DELEGATES TO THIS MEETING, FOR THE

KNOWLEDGE, WISDOM, EXPERTISE AND EXPERIENCE WHICH YOU

CORPORATELY POSSESS AND WHICH, COMBINED, OFFERS ALL THE

INGREDIENTS FOR THE ADVICE AND GUIDANCE WE SEEK.

THIS HISTORIC GATHERING WILL, I AM CERTAIN, CHART A SUCCESSFUL

COURSE FOR WHAT WILL BE A CHALLENGING AND REWARDING TASK.

I AM CONFIDENT THAT IN PURSUING THIS VITAL ELEMENT OF OUR HEALTH

FOR ALL STRATEGY, WE WILL ALL BE DRIVEN BY THE KNOWLEDGE THAT

AUSTRALIA'S MULTICULTURALISM IS ONE OF ITS GREATEST ASSETS.

AND, UNLESS WE PROTECT AND PROMOTE THE HEALTH OF THAT MOST

PRECIOUS ASSET, WE RISK UNDERMINING ITS INESTIMABLE VALUE TO

AUSTRALIA AND ALL ITS CITIZENS.

23.

coe-io7 Â·Â»

IT GIVES ME A GREAT DEAL OF PLEASURE TO DECLARE THIS, THE FIRST

NATIONAL ETHNIC HEALTH POLICY CONFERENCE, OFFICIALLY OPEN, AND

TO REMIND YOU OF THESE FAMOUS WORDS OF THOMAS JEFFERSON, SPOKEN

AT THE AMERICAN DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE ON JULY 4, 1776:

"WE HOLD THESE TRUTHS TO BE SELF-EVIDENT, THAT ALL MEN ARE

CREATED EQUAL, THAT THEY ARE ENDOWED BY THEIR CREATOR WITH

CERTAIN UNALIENABLE RIGHTS, THAT AMONG THESE ARE LIFE,

LIBERTY AND THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS."

.  IF HE WERE SPEAKING TODAY, JEFFERSON WOULD ALMOST CERTAINLY HAVE

ADDED GOOD HEALTH AND ITS PROTECTION TO THAT LIST OF EQUAL

RIGHTS FOR ALL.
