TRANSCRIPT OF THE LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION  ALEXANDER DOWNER MP

BRIDGEWATER, ADELAIDE HILLS

Topics: Multiculturalism; Immigration; Medicare

E & OE: .............................................................................................................................

Journalist: Mr Downer, Senator Bolkus says that your ethnic and immigration policies  still lacks any validity.

Downer: Well, Senator Bolkus is the Minister who has presided over a Labor Party  which has politicised ethnic affairs. Labor has used ethnic communities for political  purposes for the last decade. I think it is a matter of great shame to the Labor Party

that they should be exploiting multiculturalism and ethnic communities to try to win votes  and win elections. I think they should have a broader vision of multiculturalism and a  broader vision of immigration than simply a political vision. Senator Bolkus is the man  who's presided over the politicisiation of multiculturalism and immigration and ethnic

affairs in this country and I'm determined to bring all that process to an end.

Journalist: How?

Downer: Well, we're going to have a clear cut policy which will support multiculturalism.  For us multiculturalism is diversity in one nation. One set of laws but with  encouragement for cultural diversity within Australia. Our immigration program won't  be based on political considerations. Our immigration program will be based on the

continuation of the process of nation building, but making sure that immigration targets  fit in with our economic circumstances at the time.

Journalist: So your grasp of multiculturalism is not superficial? It's not simply as Senator  Bolkus puts it "having yum cha and appreciating ethnic costumes"?

Downer: Well Senator Bolkus could cast aside his personal abuse and denigration about  people who support multiculturalism, that aren't members of the Australian Labor Party.  Senator Bolkus is a person who has simply used multiculturalism for party political  purposes, has ruthlessly exploited ethnic groups for party political purposes instead of  building a stronger multicultural Australia. The Liberal Party under Malcolm Fraser

made enormous strides in building sensible multiculturalism in this country. The Fraser  Government did it in a way which was non-party political. The Fraser Government  established the Institution of Multicultural Affairs. Labor abolished it. The Fraser  Government established the Migration Resource Centres. The Fraser Government  brought in Indo-Chinese refugees when many people in the Labor Party were opposing -

Australia accepting Indo-Chinese refugees. Don't let that ever be forgotten. So I'm not  going to sit by and take this patronising nonsense from Senator Bolkus when he is one  of the Ministers under Labor who has presided over the blatant politicisation of  multiculturalism.

Journalist: Mr Downer, Bolkus has also said that the ALP is not threatened by your  moves in his words to woo them..... (inaudible) .... should the ALP feel threatened?

Downer: I think the ALP feels threatened, full stop. The Australian Labor Party's been  in power in this country for eleven years and it's about time Australia made a fresh start.  Senator Bolkus knows that Australians want a fresh start, so does Mr Keating. They  haven't a clue what to do about it. They're panicking. They're running around dishing  out personal abuse and making allegations against me - not a day goes by without the  Labor Party descending to personal abuse of me. I'm flattered. I'm flattered they should  go to the trouble.

Journalist: Mr Downer, Mrs Bishop said she's received leaked information from Cabinet  which indicates that health funding is going to be increased. Yet Carmen Lawrence has  ruled out any increase in Medicare. Is Mrs Bishop .... (inaudible) ....

Downer: The ALP-ACTU paper clearly supports an increase in the Medicare levy.  There's no doubt that the Labor Party is going to increase the Medicare levy. The  answer to the question we await is the timing of that. The Medicare levy is obviously  going to go up despite the Government promise before the last election there'd be no

increase in the Medicare levy. Let me say one other thing - it is quite clear that in time  the Labor Party is determined to wipe out private health insurance in this country. The  Labor Party is doing nothing to encourage Australians back into private health insurance,  and giving every incentive to push them out. The increases there have been in the

Medicare levy already have been a disincentive for people to stay in private health  insurance. The Labor Party has an ideological mindset against providing any tax  concessions for private health insurance. The fact is that Labor's health policy is just  falling into a shambles with Labor member against Labor member fighting over its future.

Journalist: Do Liberals still support tax concessions for private health cover?

M r Downer: We certainly support tax concessions for private health cover for low and middle income earners. Although the extent will be determined in the context of our  policy formulation.

Journalist: So you don't know whether it's going to be across the board or means tested?

Mr Downer: We'll wait and see, but before the last election let me tell you it was means  tested, it was only for low and middle income earners.

Journalist: Under Fightback! the Liberals set aside $1.5 billion to cover that. How would the Liberals recover those costs in the future, increase Medicare, or restrict bulk  billing?

M rD ow nen No we won't be restricting bulk billing. Any programs that, any tax  concessions, or any tax concessions that we provide in our policies leading up to the next  election will be fully funded. Mainly they will be funded out of reductions in government  spending in other areas so that will of course be over some period of time. And the  extent of any tax concessions for private health insurance will be determined on the basis  of what we feel we can afford.
