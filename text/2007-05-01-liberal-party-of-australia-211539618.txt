Outreach officers to visit northern tablelands

Tuesday, 1 May 2007

Officers from the Department of Immigration and Citizenship (DIAC) will be in  the northern tablelands region soon as part of a regional outreach visit.

Minister for Immigration and Citizenship Kevin Andrews said the outreach trips  planned for Inverell, Armidale, Tamworth and Gunnedah were a great way for  people in regional areas to sit down and talk about immigration-related issues  face-to-face with DIAC officers.

‘The Australian Government places great importance on providing services to  regional areas and these visits are a large part of that,’ Mr Andrews said.

‘These visits attract a range of people, from farmers to small business owners,  community groups to individuals, who might want information or just someone  to talk them through a complex matter.

‘While the department has a great deal of information available over the  phone or on the Internet, some people prefer to speak to officers face-to-face,  and these visits are about meeting that need.

‘In the past, the most popular topics related to citizenship, work visas, visas  for family members and how to propose and sponsor refugees,’ the Minister  added.
