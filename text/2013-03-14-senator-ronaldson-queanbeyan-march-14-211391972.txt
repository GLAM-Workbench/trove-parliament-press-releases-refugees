TONY ABBOTT:

It is terrific to be here at the Queanbeyan RSL bowling club. It is good to be with Peter Hendy, the candidate for Eden-Monaro, my

shadow ministerial colleagues Michael Ronaldson and Stuart Robert and General Molan who is one of Australia's most senior and  most celebrated recently serving soldiers.

It is great to be with the ex-service community and to talk to them about their issues. I will come back to that in a moment. I just

want to say by way of introduction that today marks six months until September 14th which is the date that the Prime Minister has  nominated for the election. Every day between now and September 14th I will be talking about our real solutions plan to give

Australia a more prosperous economy for a safe and secure future. We are going to deliver 2 million jobs over a decade. We will  remove the toxic taxes such as the carbon tax and the mining tax which are holding our economy back. We will stop the boats by

reintroducing the policies that have been proven to work. We will get the budget back in the black because it is only by removing  unnecessary spending that we will have the money to spend on the things that Australians really need. Like a proper indexation

system for our Defence pensions.

In six months' time, six months from today, the Australian people can vote for a fair and just system for Australia's Defence  pensioners. The DFRDB and DFRB deserve to be indexed properly. What's good for civilians is good for former Defence Force

personnel. They have taken risks for our country. They have potentially put their lives on the line for us and we need to respect  them and to honour them in their retirement and that's what the Coalition will do.

I am going to ask Ronno to say a few words and then I will take some questions.

MICHAEL RONALDSON:

Thanks Tony, this policy of course recognises the uniqueness of military service which the Coalition and Tony are very passionate

about. The Labor Party has had now two chances to bring in fair indexation. There was a Coalition bill in the Senate two years  ago which the Government voted down. Yesterday, two minutes before we were due to vote, to debate some amendments on a

veterans bill, they pulled the bill and they will not debate our fair indexation bill. They are constantly letting down the DFRDB and  DFRB veterans.

The person who should be taking responsibility for this is the man who talks the talk but refuses to walk the walk. Mike Kelly of all

people should know how important this is. Mike Kelly comes down to Queanbeyan. He says he is going to do something about it  and when he goes back into Parliament House, he does nothing at all. Mike Kelly has got to stand up for the people he says he

represents. Mike Kelly has let them down and Mike Kelly should ensure that this bill is brought on for debate in the Senate next  week so we can deliver fair indexation.

TONY ABBOTT:

Ok, do we have any questions?

QUESTION:

The Prime Minister has announced she will lock penalty rates into the Fair Work Act, what's your response to that?

TONY ABBOTT:

We will have a look at the detail of the particular proposal but, as I understand it, what she has said is these would be matters for  Fair Work Australia or the Fair Work Commission. That's actually the way things currently are. It is not really a new

announcement. It is just another gesture and we support ensuring that workers get a fair go and, as I keep saying, the pay and  conditions of the decent hard-working people of Australia will be safe under the Coalition.

QUESTION:

The Prime Minister has again taken on the 457 visa issue today. Do you concede there are some foreign workers, at least there

are examples of foreign workers taking away opportunities from Australians?

TONY ABBOTT:

This is a massive smokescreen to hide the Government's persistent failures on border protection and we have had seven boats in  just nine days. Every time the Prime Minister talks about 457s, think border protection failures because that's all this is. It is a

simple distraction, a transparent political tactic by a government and a Prime Minister desperate to hide their own failures.

QUESTION:

When will Australians be able to judge you on that promise? What's the time frame that you can be judged on whether or not you  have upheld that commitment?

TONY ABBOTT:

We can make a difference from the first few weeks. We can make a difference from the first few weeks but I just want to reiterate

what I think was a very good statement by Barry O'Farrell in the NSW Parliament yesterday, “this is a Prime Minister who can't  stop the boats so what's she doing? She wants to stop the brains from coming to Australia” because these are people who are

making an economic contribution, paying taxes from day one. These are skilled migrants and you will never find from me any  attempt to criticise skilled migrants coming to this country.

QUESTION:

If the boat’s don’t descend to Howard era levels post 2001 by say, your first 100 days in office, will you have failed?

TONY ABBOTT:

As I said, I think we can make a substantial difference within a matter of weeks and we have the policies that have been proven to

work. Now, they don’t work over night and they don’t necessarily even work in a week, but in a relatively short space of time we  will see a very substantial difference. It’s important to remember that more illegal arrivals have come in the last nine months under

this government than came in the whole 11 years of the Howard Government.

QUESTION:

How much of the 457 issue is xenophobia and the race card being played here?

TONY ABBOTT:

That’s really an issue for the Prime Minister but the hypocrisy of this government is truly monumental. The Prime Minister said two  years ago that the 457 system was working well, now she’s trying to say that this is somehow responsible for all the job insecurity

that people throughout our country are facing. Well, if you want to know why the workers of Australia are facing job insecurity, look  at the carbon tax, look at the botched mining tax, look at this government’s profligacy, look at all the regulations that this

government is loading up the employers of this country with. That’s why the workers of this country face economic insecurity and  the Prime Minister should just for once be fair dinkum about that.

QUESTION:

Was Joe Hockey rolled in Shadow Cabinet over his proposed cuts to the baby bonus?

TONY ABBOTT:

I just want to make it absolutely crystal clear that we do not support governments breaking their promises. Now this government

swore until it was blue in the face, prior to getting elected, that it was not going to tamper with the baby bonus. This is the fourth

22/11/2013 http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/22487/20130903-0148/www.tonyabbott.c...

substantial change to the baby bonus. This is the fourth time the government has dudded the families of Australia by reducing the  baby bonus and we are not going to support in the parliament a government yet again breaking a solid commitment.

QUESTION:

[Inaudible] did the Shadow Cabinet support or reject that?

TONY ABBOTT:

If this legislation is passed by the Parliament, we give no guarantees that we will be able to restore it because we are in a very

dire fiscal position because of the $300 billion in debt that this government has saddled us with.

QUESTION:

Will you restore it?

TONY ABBOTT:

Obviously we are proud of the baby bonus. The baby bonus was one of the signature policies of the Howard Government. It was  such a successful policy that this government promised before it got elected never to touch it, never to detract from it. But yet

again it’s a broken promise.

QUESTION:

[inaudible] save half a billion dollars and you are promising to get the budget back into surplus.

TONY ABBOTT:

Now, the point I make, the point I make is that we cannot solve all the problems of this country from the wrong side of the  parliament and we can’t fix all of the damage that this government has done overnight.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, just on penalty rates, under a Coalition government would you commit to keeping penalty rates as they are today?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, penalty rates are a matter for the Fair Work commission and that’s the way it should stay.

QUESTION:

Just back to the baby bonus, you’re saying you’ll oppose it in the parliament on the politics, not on the economics of it?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well there are…it’s very important that we get the budget deficit under control but the best way to do that is not to be tough on the

Australian people, it’s to reduce waste and bloat in government and that’s where the thrust of the Coalition’s expenditure  reductions will be. We want to reduce waste and bloat in government, we don’t want to be tough on the forgotten families of

Australia.

QUESTION:

Is there a push though within the Coalition to actually cut the baby bonus though on the economics?

TONY ABBOTT:

No, there is a determination on the part of the Coalition to reduce unnecessary government spending…

QUESTION:

Does that include the baby bonus?

TONY ABBOTT:

…and the best way to reduce unnecessary government spending is to eliminate the waste and the bloat in government.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, how would you characterise the leadership change in the Northern Territory yesterday?

TONY ABBOTT:

I’m not going to pretend that there hasn’t been a degree of instability over the last few weeks in the Territory Government but the

interesting thing is that change was affected by the party room, not by the faceless men of the union movement.

QUESTION:

What about change at the Vatican?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, it is a great day for the world's 1.2 billion Catholics. It is a momentous day for the church and that's good.

QUESTION:

Do you endorse the process that was carried out in the Northern Territory by your Party?

TONY ABBOTT:

In the end, every parliamentary leader depends upon the support, the ongoing support, of the party room and the fundamental  distinction between the Coalition and the Labor Party and is that our party room makes or breaks the leader. With the Labor Party,

it is not the Caucus, it is the faceless men dictating to the Caucus that makes or breaks Prime Minister.
