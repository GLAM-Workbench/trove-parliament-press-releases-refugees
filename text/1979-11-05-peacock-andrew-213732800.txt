UN PLEDGING CONFERENCE ON KAMPUCHEAN RELIEF

Statement, by the Minister for Foreign Affairs  Mr Andrew Peacock, at the United Nations Pledging Conference,  for Emergency Humanitarian Relief to the People of Kampuchea,  on 5 November 1979 in New YorkÂ»

Mr Secretary-General,

By convening this conference,  you have reinforced  the awareness we all have of the massive and urgent needs of  the Kampuchean peopleÂ» In the joint ICRC/UNICEF appeal which  you launched on 19 October you gave us a framework within  which an effective program of assistance could be developedÂ»

Today you have pointed again to the tragic plight of the  people of Kampuchea and suggested ways in which we might  most appropriately respondÂ»

Australia by its actions has long demonstrated that  the welfare of the peoples of Indo-China,  no less than the  stability of the South-East Asian region, are matters of deep  and immediate concernÂ» Since the Second World War we have

sought to involve ourselves constructively in the affairs and  development of South-East AsiaÂ» Regrettably peace and progress  have not come easily to many of the countries which lie to our  north,  and today we witness in Kampuchea a tragic manifestation

of the upheavals through which the region has been passingÂ»

The disaster which has befallen the Khmer people and  their culture is possibly without parallel in modern timesÂ»  Casualties through murder,  brutality,  starvation and disease  run into the hundreds of thousands,  and the extent of man's

inhumanity to man seems to have known no limitsÂ» This modern  holocaust threatens to destroy the uniqueness of the Cambodian  civilisation, indeed the very identity of the Khmer race itselfÂ»  Seldom before has it been more vital to allocate to humanitarian

considerations such absolute priority in a context where the  underlying and continuing political causes cry out for  condemnationÂ»

The Australian people have clearly demonstrated the  depth of their feelings for the suffering being experienced by  the people of KampucheaÂ» They have responded willingly and _   generously to the Kampuchean relief appeal launched by Australian

non-government relief organisationsÂ» To date $2Â» 5 million has  been raised through that appeal= The Australian Government has

2

itself contributed promptly and substantially to international  efforts to alleviate the plight of civilians in Kampuchea.  Australia is proud to have been at the vanguard of .

international efforts to alleviate the suffering and distress  Ã¢ÂÂ¢  in Kampuchea. Almost $A4 million has already been provided  to support 1CRC,  UNICEF,  WFP and other agency programs in  Kampuchea.

Following a contribution of 4,000 tonnes of rice  to the World Food Program, cash grants of $A250,000 each were  made to the International Red Cross,  UNICEF and the World  Food Program. Because of the heavy burdens imposed on  Thailand.by the refugee flow from Kampuchea, an additional

sum of $250,000 has beengiven to the Thai Government. The  sum of $200,000 is also being allocated to Australian InterÂ­ national Disaster Emergencies Committee (IDEC) to. support  the programs of a number of voluntary relief agencies. Three  air lifts of emergency relief supplies from Australia to  Phnom Penh were made successfully at a total cost of  approximately $A250,000. In response to an appeal by the  ICRC and Thai Red Cross,  ""we have agreed to fund an Australian  medical team of 10 doctors and 10 nurses at a cost of $300,000

to work for six months amongst the Khmer refugees in Thailand.  The vanguard of this mission, which is being organised by  the Australian Red Cross, has already left for Thailand.

Mr Chairman, we are all concerned that aid reach  every person in need. In this,  the co-operation of all  relevant authorities is of the utmost importance. Our  humanitarian purpose is clear. We all owe a great debt of

gratitude to the international relief agencies w h o ,  in  consultation with the relevant authorities,  have identified  the priority needs of the Kampuchean people and defined  an appropriate program of relief assistance. True to their  long standing humanitarian relief traditions, organisations such  as ICRC, UNICEF and WFP have spared no effort to bring relief  to all the innocent victims of the oppression and Conflict  to which Kampuchea has been subjected. They deserve the support  of_ all of as in their endeavours = Without their dedicated  work and co-operation,  our relief efforts - both governmental

and private - would not have been possible in Kampuchea.

As the Secretary-General has pointed o ut,  there  has also been a very heavy influx of Kampuchean refugees into

3

Si,

Thailando Up to 300,000 people may have to be helped. This is an incredible burden which no Government can  be expected to carry alone. Already the Thai Government has  made major sacrifices to accommodate the tide of Khmer

refugees which has flooded across its borders. Only if  we all are prepared to lend assistance will Thailand be  able to cope, Australia,  for its part, is prepared to  provide such assistance. '

Mr Chairman, we are united in our determination  to avert a major human catastrophe and to alleviate the  suffering of the Kampuchean people. While the problem is  worse in some parts of the country than in others,  disease

and deprivation continue at an unacceptable level throughout  Kampuchea, The immediate efforts of all of us must be  directed to providing and supporting operations which will  ensure that all those in need receive help. Lives will be

lost if aid is not moved in expeditiously and efficiently. The present distribution bottlenecks must be overcome. Yet the economy and infrastructure of Kampuchea are shattered  and it will take years before life in the couritry returns

to normal. There is a serious shortage of mechanised  transport, and without a concentrated effort to improve  the means of distribution of relief supplies on the ground,   our best intentions could be frustrated by logistical  problems. It is not therefore too early to turn our attention

to the long-term rehabilitation of Kampuchea. We must never  allow the conditions which have given rise to this, disaster  to recur. We must ensure that Kampuchea1s human resources  and material capacities are restored to the productive  levels of the past. This task of reconstruction will  ultimately be as important as the immediate need for relief.

Accordingly,  Mr Chairman,  the Australian Government,   in assessing the scale of its continuing response to the relief  efforts in Kampuchea and Thailand, has taken into account  the future as well as the present needs of the Kampuchean people

The Australian Government has decided to double its contribution  by pledging $A4 million in addition to the $3,8 million it  has already provided. The new commitment by the Australian  Government of $4 million will’raise the Australian’ " total:  to Â·

$7.8 million.
