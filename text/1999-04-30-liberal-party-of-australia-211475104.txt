Temporary 
Safe Haven for Kosovo AlbaniansÂ   
passes the Senate

Â

The passage of the   Migration Legislation Amendment 
(Temporary Safe Haven Visas) Bill 1999   through the Senate today has been welcomed by the 
Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock.

The Bill was today passed with the support of all 
Senators.

Mr Ruddock said that it is important to acknowledge 
the assistance of my Parliamentary Secretary, Senator the Hon Kay Patterson 
in taking the legislation through the Senate process. In addition, the 
Minister thanked the Labor Party, Greens, Democrats and Senators Harradine 
and Colston for their support and cooperation in this legislative process.

"The Bill gives effect to the Government's commitment 
on 6 April 1999 to provide temporary safe haven for 4,000 persons displaced 
from their homes in Kosovo.

"This Bill puts in place the framework to allow 
the Government to respond immediately, if and when the United Nations 
High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) re-activates its request for Australia 
to assist in a temporary protection capacity.

The Bill will be introduced into the House of Representatives 
during the Budget sittings.

"The swift passage of the Bill through the House 
will finalise Australia's legislative measures to assist in alleviating 
the massive suffering and human tragedy that has developed in the Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia.

"It is appropriate and encouraging that a humanitarian 
crisis of this nature is above party politics, and for this reason, 
I commend the actions of Senators in passing the Bill today" Mr 
Ruddock concluded.
