MEDIA RELEASE

COALITION’S DIRECT ACTION PLAN: STRONG  BORDERS & HUMANE TREATMENT

The Coalition has announced a suite of measures that, if elected, would deliver to both  strengthen our borders and to prioritise offshore refugee applications.

At the cornerstone of the announcement is the trial of a refugee sponsorship program. This  program would enable groups within Australia to directly sponsor a refugee, over and above  the Government’s program.  Similar programs are already operating in Canada. Further, we  would increase the proportion of places we make available out of the 13,750 quota for those  recommended by the UNHCR program.

“This announcement strikes the balance between having strong border protection measures  and still meets and goes above our international obligations,” ACT Liberal Senator Gary  Humphries said today.

“As a member of the Coalition’s team in this area, I am proud to support this policy.

“In particular, the trial refugee sponsorship program will go a long way to deny people smugglers a  product to sell.

“This program could potentially apply to both temporary and permanent protection visas, with  different bond rates for each.

“These bonded private sponsorships would operate in a way similar to the contributory parent visa  program and enable community groups, approved by the Government, to provide sponsorship to  people assessed as refugees by the UNHCR off shore.

“The program would not be available to individual sponsors to protect against any abuse of the  program and would not be available to persons who entered Australia illegally. All sponsored persons  would need to satisfy health, identify and security checks and be approved by the Australian  Government.

“The number of places would be in addition to those established each year for our regular refugee and  humanitarian program.

“The pilot would be introduced in the first term of Coalition Government with a view to establishing a  permanent program in a subsequent term. The private sponsorship program could therefore enable  Australia to lift our refugee intake to 15,000 within three years.

“The Coalition will consult on the development of the pilot program, which would be based on the  Canadian model.

“It is absolutely critical that we deny people smugglers a product to sell, and this policy does  exactly that.

“Not only will we favour applicants who have applied through legitimate processes off shore,  but we will also increase the number of genuine refugees we resettle in Australia.

“Only a Coalition Government can stop the boats and ensure that legitimate refugees are  treated humanely.

“In contrast, Labor’s border protection failures are resulting in an average of 3 boats a week  arriving, some even calling 000.

“In order to stop the boats and the dangerous people smuggling industry as well as to deploy  strong and humane refugee policies, you have to be serious about shifting from a people-smuggler-centred program to a planned and controlled program.

“Only a Coalition Government can achieve this, and I strongly support this direct action plan  to get Australia’s borders and refugee processes back on track,” Senator Humphries  concluded.
