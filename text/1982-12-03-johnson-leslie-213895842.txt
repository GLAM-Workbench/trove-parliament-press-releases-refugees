MIGRANT CENTRE CLOSUREÃ¢ÂÂ TEMPORARY

Action by community groups to utilise the Fairy Meadow Migrant  Centre has been unsuccessful said Federal Member for Hughes, Mr Les  Johnson.

According to advice given to Mr Johnson the Government regards the  closure as 'temporary' and will not consider alternative uses of  the centre in the short term.

Mr Johnson said the decision to close the migrant centre was  taken following an assessment of hostel needs for migrants and  refugees which showed a fall in demand in the Illawarra area.

"This is a result of the abolition of the Assisted Passage Scheme  and the general economic and unemployment situation currently  prevailing, he said.

"When the centre will re-open again will depend partly upon the  prospects for employment in the area and also, upon the number of  migrants who might be sponsored by their relatives under the family  reunion migration policy.

In the meantime the Migrant Centre will be maintained on a

caretaker basis, Mr Johnson said.

"The Government took the same sort of action in closing Fairy

Meadow in 1977 and then re-opening it in July 1978, he said.
