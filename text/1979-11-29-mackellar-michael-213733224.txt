ENGLISH LANGUAGE CLASSES IN THE ACT

The transfer of English language classes from Â·

North Ainslie to the Griffin Centre would make them more

accessible to migrant clients,  a spokesman for the  Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs said today.

The Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs

provides funds for the Adult Migrant and Refugee Education  Program in the ACT. The ACT Office of Further Education

administers the program through Canberra and Bruce TAFE

Colleges.

Â»

The move was in line with recommendations of the

Galbally Report on Post-Arrival Programs and Services to

Migrants,  the spokesman said.

Low enrolments at North Ainslie over recent months

had demonstrated that the location was not suitable.

In October, attendance at the four. Ainslie classes,

had averaged only five students.1 -  1 Students were advised

that they could attend similar classes nearby at Lyneham.

;  *

The program consists of a range of learning

opportunities for recent and earlier arrivals , covering

full-time and part-time courses, continuation classes,

courses at the work place and the Home Tutor Scheme.  Classes

’  are offered at 11 centres in the ACT as well as Queanbeyan.

ÃÂ

Location of some courses at the Griffin Centre

from early in 1980 is expected to increase their access .

to students,  particularly those relying on public transport.

The DIEA spokesman said experience had shown that

the more students a centre attracted the better it would be  able to meet the needs of people from various language,

occupational and educational backgrounds.

The transfer to the Griffin Centre was also expected

to facilitate the change recommended by the Galbally Report

from "continuation" classes to fixed-length part-time courses

with specific language goals.

The spokesman denied claims by part-time teachers

that declining numbers at North Ainslie were caused by lack .

of publicity for the program.

Ã¢ÂÂ   & .

Advertising had been increased substantially over

the past year and had included use of newspapers,  radio,

television, buses and signs in sports arenas and other

public places.
