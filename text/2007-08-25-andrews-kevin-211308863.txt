Howard Government’s strong border policy delivers  security for all

Saturday, 25th August 2007

The Howard Government’s strong border protection policies deliver security  for all Australians.

Our policies have been successful because we have made it clear - if you  attempt to enter Australia unlawfully, you will not be successful.

Today, Oxfam and A Just Australia have jointly released a report ironically  titled ‘A Price Too High: The cost of Australia’s approach to Asylum Seekers’.

It is ironic because risking the success of our border policies is simply a price  too high.

The Howard Government’s border protection policies have effectively ceased  the influx of illegal boat arrivals.

There have been less than 250 boat arrivals since January 2002, compared to  some 12,000 in the preceding two-and-a-half years.

The success of our border protection policies has enabled Australia to commit  to resettling 13,000 people each year identified by the UNHCR as in need of  refugee and humanitarian aid.

The changes to policy advocated in this naive report are the flawed policies  that Kevin and Rudd and Labor would implement if given the chance.

Labor’s policy simply says that anyone who tries to reach Australia will be  taken to Christmas Island and promptly placed in the Australian community  regardless of who they are.

This is an open door policy that will encourage and embolden people  smugglers to put large groups of people on unseaworthy vessels and head for  Australia.

Labor remain wedded to the policies of minority interest groups.

It is a clear message why Labor is unfit to keep integrity in our immigration  system and protect Australia’s borders.
