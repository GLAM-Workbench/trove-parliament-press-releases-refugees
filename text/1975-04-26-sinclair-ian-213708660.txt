Special Article by Ian Sinclair, Deputy Leader of the Australian

Country Party and Opposition Spokesman on Rural Industry.

In the past, this column has been confined to rural matters.

But with the permission of the editor, I would like to start off by

digressing and paying a tribute to some Australians, concerned in the

past with Australian rural.industry.

The people I would like to pay tribute to are Australian aid workers

in South Vietnam and Cambodia.

Many readers will recall that a few weeks ago .1 visited.both Cambodia  Ã¢ÂÂ¢  .. .  -  .  .  Â· Ã¢ÂÂ  -  ÃÂ» ; -  ........ ‘

and' South Vietnam. Â·  l\

In’  Phnom" Penh, I met an Australian - Michael Bosworth, struggling .. .  -s ^ -.v :  ÃÂ¯- r r , ,  : . Â· :  J'< Ã¢ÂÂ  '  Ã¢ÂÂ  '  '  ' k Â· :  "

against incredable odds to keep the Australian Dairy Produce Board

partly financed milk recombination plant going.

The milk from the plant, Michael was having distributed to the Ã¢ÂÂ   .

children of the one and a half million refugees in the city and was

a major factor in keeping the children alive.

I had been told before going into Phnom Penh that the plant had been  Â«- Â·  -  1 1

closed for six months but when I visited the plant with Michael, he

still had the plant going thus saving many children from death by,

starvation. '

His Herculean task and the manner in which he"was undertaking it,

deeply impressed me.

So- did the actions of Australian officials involved in .rural,  ’  t> Â·  i Â· ; Ã¢ÂÂ  K

projects in South Vietnam.

The aid officials stayed at their posts until the last possible

moment before falling back to Saigon bringing with them in many

refugees who needed assistance. .  .

Australian aid officials in other fields - medical care, child

orphanage operations all did as much as they could and showed to me

their unselfishness and dedication to their task. .

They deserve from all of us, our thanks. Ã¢ÂÂ   .  Â·

Returning to rural matters, I find the Government's further

announcement on assistance to the beef industry excessivelyr

restrictive and of little real value. Â·  .

It is quite obvious that the Government has no idea of the magnitude

of the problem facing the beef industry.

Industry leaders have contacted me about the Government's failure

to make a statement on assistance to the wool industry regarding the

operations of the Australian Wool Commission in the coming year.

I understand that a decision could be made by the Government next

week. .  .

I personally believe that the decision should have been made and

announced some time ago in order that the announcement could

have brought confidence to the wool market. ,

On the Opposition front, the Opposition Parties are well advanced " Ã¢ÂÂ   "'I ' Â· "  .

in their deliberations on rural policy which are taking place

with rural industry.

Since I last wrote, many members of the rural community have written

in with policy ideas. Â·  .  '

I would be grateful if people who have ideaÂ§ could write to me .

with them and I will place them before the committee working on '  '

rural policy on their behalf. .  ‘  .  ""~

I can assure you they will be seriously considered.
