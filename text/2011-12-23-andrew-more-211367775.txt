E&OE……………………….…………………………………………………………………

ANDREW MOORE:

Tony, thanks for your time once again this morning.

TONY ABBOTT:

Thanks for having me on the programme, Andrew.

ANDREW MOORE:

Have you received anything in writing yet?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, we did. At about six or six thirty last night, about an hour or so after Chris Bowen’s press conference,  we did get a letter from the Acting Prime Minister and I want to say thank you to the Government for giving  us a specific proposal in writing. I want to say that it’s good that they are prepared to meet with us today and  I think that meeting should definitely include Kevin Rudd and Julie Bishop because these are important  foreign policy considerations, not just immigration matters and I say thank God, thank God Andrew that the  Government has finally accepted that Nauru is critical if we are going to stop the boats. Now, it can’t be just  Nauru. There’s got to be temporary protection visas because the people smugglers have got to lose the  product that they sell.

ANDREW MOORE:

Are they in the proposal you’ve received?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, we will get to that in a sec and it’s also got to include the option of turning boats around where it’s  safe to do so. Now, in the end, it is the Government’s responsibility to control our borders. If you can’t  control our borders, you can’t govern the country but as far as the Opposition is concerned, if they are  putting forward good policy and they need our help to make it happen, yes, they will have that help. We will  always support good policy and I think that what the Government should be doing today as well as meeting  with the Opposition is getting on the phone to the President of Nauru. Nauru has always stood ready to take

boat people from Australia. I just wish that it hadn’t taken 14,000 illegal arrivals and almost 300 boats to  actually get the Prime Minister to see sense and reopen the centre that was closed down by this Government  four years ago.

ANDREW MOORE:

Alright now, obviously there is still some issues that need to be sorted out and I’ll get back to the temporary  protection visas. Is that in the proposal?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, it’s interesting, yesterday the Acting Prime Minister said at lunchtime that all options were on the  table. In his letter last night, he ruled out temporary protection visas and I have to say in the same spirit, I’m  not at all happy about Malaysia. We said Malaysia was a bad deal six months ago. It’s still a bad deal. No  self respecting country will take five from another place just to have one taken off its hands. There are no  protections in place for people who are sent to Malaysia. They are exposed to caning which is a significant  part of Malaysia’s legal system and look, Andrew, my view is that if something is wrong today, it’s wrong  tomorrow. We don’t change our position from day to day, from month to month. We are consistent and I  think one of the reasons why this Government has got itself into so much trouble is because it believes in  one thing one day and a different thing the next day. Look at the carbon tax. That was never going to happen  before the election and it had to happen after the election. Now, we all know that the Prime Minister just did  that in order to get the Greens into her Government.

ANDREW MOORE:

So have we move forward at least a step here, is there definitely going to be a meeting between the  Government and the Opposition today?

TONY ABBOTT:

As far as I’m concerned yes. Julie Bishop and Scott Morrison are only too happy to meet with the  Government. As I said, it really should include Kevin Rudd and this is an important foreign policy question  if the Government is to effectively move forward on Nauru and Manus and other things where they need the  Coalition’s support, it’s got to be a united government and I think that means that Kevin Rudd has got to be  part of it. We can’t have deals being done where the Prime Minister wants one thing and the Foreign  Minister is actively pulling against her.

ANDREW MOORE:

Is he in town at the moment?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, I think he was in Melbourne overnight. I think that means that Kevin Rudd’s more than available to  have a meeting in Sydney or Canberra today.

ANDREW MOORE:

So where do we need to go in terms of compromises? You are still looking for temporary protection visas  for Nauru and Malaysia, you are not prepared to bend until they are signatories with the United Nations  convention?

TONY ABBOTT:



The thing is that Malaysia is just a bad deal. Now, if the Government had accepted our amendment to its bill  in the parliament and Malaysia had signed the convention, yes, the processing could’ve gone ahead in  Malaysia, but I don’t think there’s much chance that Malaysia will do that and that’s why I think it’s very  important to get cracking with Nauru. See the interesting thing Andrew is that Scott Morrison and I have  been to Nauru. We have seen the facilities. We know because we’ve spoken to the Nauruan Government  that those facilities could be up and running within a matter of weeks, before parliament meets in February,  Nauru can be up and running. So, why muck around waiting for legislation that might or might not validate  Malaysia? Get Nauru up and running and if you’ve got Nauru, you don’t need Malaysia.

ANDREW MOORE:

They do need the Opposition to sign off on Nauru, which you won’t do until they offer the temporary  protection visas.

TONY ABBOTT:

No, no, no, look we will sign up on Nauru. We are going to sign up on Nauru. I mean, any help they need to  do Nauru, we will give them. Now we will urge them introduce temporary protection visas and they don’t  need legislation to do that. They can do that with the stroke of a pen. We will urge them to also adopt a  policy of turning boats around where it’s safe to do so but we are going to give them full cooperation on any  good policy that they put forward. Nauru is good policy. If that’s what they want to do, they will have full  support from the Opposition and as I say, rather than just meet with the Opposition today, they should be on  the phone to the President of Nauru and get cracking.

ANDREW MOORE:

Get it moving.

TONY ABBOTT:

Long before parliament comes back, Nauru can be receiving boat people.

ANDREW MOORE:

Alright, so hopefully there will be a meeting today and you are calling on Kevin Rudd to be a part of that.  You’ll have Julie Bishop there and also Scott Morrison?

TONY ABBOTT:

That’s correct.

ANDREW MOORE:

Alright, Tony, I appreciate your time. At least there’s some sort of movement forward.

TONY ABBOTT:

That’s right and look, thank God the Government has finally accepted that Nauru is a serious part of any  credible attempt to stop the boats and look, they must now move forward with Nauru. There can be no  procrastination. Get on the phone to the President of Nauru. If there’s any legislation needed in respect to  Nauru, of course we will pass it. We will pass it with alacrity because we should never have closed, the  Government should never have closed Nauru down in the first place. It’s taken them a long, long time and  our country has suffered bitterly and boat people have suffered bitterly because they weren’t prepared to  leave a good situation alone but thank God they’ve learnt and let’s get cracking.

ANDREW MOORE:

Almost get the feeling, bearing in mind his language yesterday, Chris Bowen might be disappointed to hear  you say all of that. Tony, thank you for your time. Have a merry Christmas and let’s hope that these talks go  in the right direction today.

TONY ABBOTT:

Ok, thanks Andrew.
