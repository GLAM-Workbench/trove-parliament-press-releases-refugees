HOPES FOR BRISBANE ABORIGINALS

(Statement by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs Senator 3.L. Cavanagh)

.  The purchase of nine properties for-Brisbane Aboriginals including

a block of six flats would help relieve the accute housing shortage in that

city which had worsened since the Darwin evacuation, the Minister for Aboriginal

Affairs Senator Cavanagh said today. :  "

Announcing a grant of $215,613 to the Black Community Housing .  ...

Service for the purchase of the properties, the Minister said the lack of a

Fair Rents Court in Queensland was partly responsible for the very high rents

bang charged by landlords. -  '  Ã¢ÂÂ   "  - .

, .  .  Aboriginals in the lower income groups or otherwise, disadvantaged

financially through widowhood or desertion, were particularly distressed by

the accommodation situation. The evacuation of "at least 400 Darwin refugees

to Brisbane had added further strain to-the problem.. "  ' .  —  .  :  ;  .

.  . . .  It was. proposed to let .the six flats, to small .families and single

working people and the houses to supporting mothers with large families at a .

rental calculated on. a percentage of family income. .  . .  ,

Senator Cavanagh said that since May. 1973 the Black Community Housing

Service —  one of 35 Aboriginal housing co-operatives in Queensland Ã¢ÂÂ  —  had .

received a total of S144,836 part of which had. been used to provide rpntal

accommodation for deserted wives and their children. -  .

The Minister added that there were now 91 similar co-operatives

throughout Australia and the number was growing steadily.- He had great confidence

in the ability of the Aboriginal people to help themselves. The fact that so

many communities were incorporating themselves to solve their housing problems . Â­

was proof that the Australian Government policy of self-determination was a

right one.
