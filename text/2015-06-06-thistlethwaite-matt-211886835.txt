E&OE TRANSCRIPT  TELEVISION INTERVIEW  SKY NEWS SATURDAY AGENDA  SATURDAY, 6 JUNE 2015

SUBJECT/S: Tax Free Threshold; Higher Unemployment; Citizenship/National  Security; Professor Gillian Triggs

DAVID LIPSON: Matt I’ll start with you first of all just to confirm this report in the Fin  by Phil Coorey is Labor going to back the Government on this saving?

MATT THISTLETHWAITE, SHADOW PARLIAMENTARY SECRETARY FOR  IMMIGRATION & FOREIGN AFFAIRS: Yes that’s right David, look the Budget’s in a  dire position, the Budget deficit in the Government’s own Budget papers increases  from $17.1 billion to $35 billion over the forward estimates, even with this $3 billion  saving being banked, so Labor’s taking a fiscally responsible approach to the  Budget, this is a saving that we believe is in the interests of Australia and that’s why  we’ve agreed to it. Can I also say that Labor’s offered constructive alternatives to  raise more revenue  for the Budget so over time we can reduce that deficit and if the  Government had have adopted Labor’s savings which include greater tax on  multinational profits being shifted overseas and also high income superannuation,  they will rake $20 billion over 10 years so it’s no irrefutable that if the Government  adopted Labor’s savings measures and our revenue measures the Budget would be  in a much better position - irrefutable!

LIPSON: You’ve resisted this though for 13 months and had a whole lot to say about  fairness in that time, this change that you’re now supporting will hit the poor the  hardest.

THISTLETHWAITE: Yes but at the same time we’ve said that we want to see the  most wealthy within our society pay their fair share so that’s why we introduced the  policy on ensuring that people with very large tax concessions on their

superannuation earning very large incomes off the balance will pay more, we’ve  opposed some of the policies that have been introduced by this Government that do  affect low paid workers for instance their increasing tax on low paid superannuation  accounts by removing the low income super contribution so Labor takes a much  fairer approach to the Budget but a much more fiscally responsible one and I think  that’s evident in the fact that if you adopted Labor’s policies the Budget would be in a  much better position but also low income workers would be much better off.

LIPSON: Senator Ryan you obviously would welcome this, it’s a $3 billion saving to  the Budget but that’s already been banked, it won’t actually improve the forecast  deficit of $35 billion will it?

SENATOR SCOTT RYAN: Well look it’s an important but small step, I’m grateful and  I’m happy that the Labor Party has finally started to understand that the Budget  deficit and the trajectory Australia was on was utterly unsustainable so I’m glad  Labor had let us legislate this after blocking it for over a year, I now just wish in the  next two weeks that Labor would get out of the way and let us legislate our other  measures that will help fix this Budget deficit including the ones Labor promised  themselves the last election. There are billions of dollars of spending reductions that  Labor promised at the last election that they’re blocking us from introducing so that  just goes to show wheat Matt mentioned there is just complete hypocrisy, Labor talks  about so called revenue measures and what they represent is raiding the  superannuation accounts of thousands of Australians, and the first attack on  superannuation by Labor won’t be the last, it’s their piggy bank and they’ve  constantly talked about how they want to increase taxes on average Australian  people, they don’t want to address their legacy of unsustainable spending.

LIPSON: Bit by bit it seems the Government is getting its savings through because  this will see the savings that are held up in the Senate reduce from $23 billion to $20  billion, there’s also another $3 billion that looks likely in a deal with the Greens on the  fuel tax, are you confident of getting the other much more controversial measures  though like the changes to higher education, welfare payments and the like are you  confident of getting them through?

RYAN: Well look David I’m an optimist, I don’t want to be presumptuous, there’s  negotiation process through the Senate, we hope the Senate respects our mandate  to actually bring the Budget back into a sustainable situation, it’s only really Labor  and the Greens who are being opportunistic and refusing to address the fact that we  can’t keep accruing debt at the rate Australia has been. Now we’ve made a lot of  announcements, we’ve even tweaked some of those responding to negotiations and  concerns of other cross bench Senators, but we do ask that the Senate actually  address the profound problem Australia faces, we can’t let our children inherit a  legacy of increasing debt and deficit and without enacting these measures, without  making the Budget sustainable we will just confine further Australians to much lower  levels of economic opportunity and social opportunity.

LIPSON: A report in Fairfax this morning suggests that the number of long term  unemployed, Scott Ryan, has hit a 16 year high, that people who have been out of  work for a year or more the number of them has risen 18 per cent over the past year.  How concerning is that figure to the Government?



RYAN: Well look that’s very concerning actually David I mean I finished school in  Victoria in 1990 and we had a legacy of long term unemployment from Labor’s  recession we had to have here that really took until the late 90s to clean up, long  term unemployment is a curse which is why we’ve got focused Budget measures  that specifically address this and we’ve already started to see a little bit of change,  we’ve had a quarter of a million jobs created since the change of Government and  job growth since 2014 was quadrupled, it was four times greater than it was in 2013,  we saw under the last few years of the chaotic Labor Government that small  business in particular went on an employment strike, it just did not have the  confidence to employ, we saw more than half Australians being employed in the  small business sector to well under half and that is why we have small business  package that’s really focused on investment which will all lead to more employment  opportunities because that’s so often when people get their first job or their attempt  to reengage with the Labor market.

LIPSON: Matt Thistlethwaite I can’t imagine you think it’s fair for Scott Ryan to blame  Labor for this?

THISTLETHWAITE: Look David forget Scott’s rhetoric he’s just spurting Tony  Abbott’s lines on this, it’s complete rubbish, look these are the facts - the Prime  Minister promised to create a million jobs when he came to Government, the fact is  that unemployment in Australia is now at its highest level since the last 14 years,  since in fact Tony Abbott was the Employment Minister, we’ve seen today the  reports that long term unemployment is now at its highest level in the last 14 years  also that’s a massive drag on our economy and the most worrying aspect is that in  the Government’s own Budget figures unemployment is forecast to go higher over  the forward estimates so the outlook for the economy is much worse than the  Government said it would be when they first came to office now the issue is how do  you deal with this? What’s the Government’s plan to deal with this? The issue for  long term unemployed people is retraining, their long term unemployed because they  don’t have the skills that are required in the modern employment market so you need  to put in place retraining programs, what’s the Government’s answer to that? Work  for the dole, sending these people out to street corners to pick up newspapers, that’s  not going to solve the long term unemployment issue you need to be focusing on  retraining and providing these people with the skills that are attractive to employers  in an employment market.

LIPSON: Scott Ryan the Prime Minister yesterday has said that pessimism is a very  self-defeating emotion, should the Government take responsibility although it is now  presenting a much more positive message, for any of the economic problems  because of the message that it was presenting over the past year or two or even  longer with Tony Abbott saying things like Australia as headed for Greek style debt,  that can’t have a good impact on things like confidence in the market and alike?

RYAN: Well you’re right David, confidence is very important unlike Matt there I think  Matt forgot the most important thing for the unemployed which is someone’s got to  have the confidence to offer them a job and Labor’s attacks on small business saw it  going from employing 55 per cent of Australian people to 45 per cent of Australian  people in only 6 years, it was a dramatic series of attacks on small business and that

made a huge impact particularly on youth unemployment where so many people get  their first job, confidence is important but if you look back through every series of  economic troubles over the last 30 years that Australia has survived in recent years  particularly well what you see is confidence comes about when Governments can  actually bring a sustainable Budget back into position, where Governments can  actually balance the books and then start providing things like tax cuts that give  businesses confidence to employ, in the end everyone who wants a job needs  someone who’ll give them that opportunity and you can pay for all these make work  programs that happen under Labor but unless you give business the confidence to  employ and things like investment allowances for small business then they’re not  going to get the opportunities and I might point out to Matt there that we are talking  about long term unemployment and a lot of the people covered in the statistics  reported today actually lost their jobs under Labor.

THISTLETHWAITE: David can I just respond to that, it’s a great example of how the  Government doesn’t get it when it comes to dealing with unemployment and long  term unemployed, if you’re a worker that’s in their 60s and has no experience  working with computers then how are you going to be attractive to an employer that’s  looking for someone with computer expertise? Employers aren’t going to say ok we  will give this person a go but the fact that they can’t turn on a computer I’m just going  to avoid that, you need to be providing long term unemployed people with the skills  that employers need in the particular market place and that’s the problem with the  Government’s approach, there’s no efforts at all and no Government support for  retraining to provide those long term unemployed people with the skills that are  necessary to get them back into the employment market.

LIPSON: Okay I want to turn to citizenship and Labor is now it seems offering  support for the plans by the Government to have the ability to strip dual nationals of  their citizenship in the cases of suspected terrorists, still wants to see the legislation  though. Gillian Triggs has raised concerns about these changes, says the executive  power has gone too far, that the expansion of ministerial powers represented a  growing threat to democracy. Scott Ryan what do you make of those comments?

RYAN: Well look Gillian Triggs commenting about attacks on democracy when I  hear people claiming the mantle of human rights yet trying to effectively undermine  two decades now where the Australian people have constantly supported strong  border protection policies, I see that as a bit of an attack on democracy. I see Gillian  Triggs comments as were reported yesterday were fairly reprehensible and we can’t  have a situation where so called human rights lobby only talks about human rights  when one side’s in office or when there are border protection policies they don’t like.  Let’s not forget that there are people who are alive today because they haven’t  drowned on boats seeking illegal access to Australia -

LIPSON: Yeah I don’t want to weigh too far into this asylum seeker issue I want to  stick with citizenship for now and you know specifically the changes for dual  nationals, there is judicial oversight but that doesn’t look at the individual cases, it  just sort of confirms that the law has been followed under these proposed changes,  is too much power resting with the Minister Matt Thistlethwaite?

THISTLETHWAITE: Well it’s appropriate for the Human Rights Commissioner to  raise these concerns David because a person’s citizenship is probably the most  fundamental human right, it’s what defines us, we’re all Australians and that’s what  defines us and if the Government is going to give the power to a Minister at their  discretion to revoke this then Labor is rightfully asking questions and indeed Gillian  Triggs about how this proposal is going to work, how it would interact with Australia  being a signatory to the convention on statelessness, there important issues that the  Government needs to deal with, you see we’re talking about a proposal here that’s  simply been floated in the media, that’s caused deep divisions within the  Government in the Cabinet, those deliberations have been leaked, what’s very  important is the details, Labor’s offered in principle support to the notion of being  able to revoke citizenship from someone who is a dual national but for others well we  need to see the detail and I think that’s something Scott and his Government are  going to need to provide in the coming weeks.

LIPSON: So you haven’t made a decision yet on sole Australian citizens whether  they should be able to have their credentials revoked. What are the concerns in  particular with those sole Australian citizens?

THISTLETHWAITE: Bill Shorten and Mark Dreyfus have outlined Labor’s principles  on this and the approach that we will take but the question does really need to be  answered and perhaps Scott can enlighten us here this morning, how will it interact  with Australia being a signatory to the convention on statelessness?

LIPSON: Scott Ryan?

RYAN: Well David this is an important distinction the Government’s made an  announcement and legislation will be coming forward I understand within days  outlining the process to strip a dual national of citizenship if they’ve committed  certain acts, the second step which is about those who are sole Australian nationals  is the subject of ongoing deliberation because we are cognisant that this is a trickier  area of law and is a trickier area with respect to Australia’s international obligations  but it’s also something worth exploring because we know the other nations such as  the UK have actually been able to enact such provisions but the debate that Gillian  Triggs was referring to was about dual nationals and those were the comments that  were reported this morning and I just find it amazing that without seeing the  legislation Australia’s so called human rights chief actually again jumps on the  Government, criticising it without having seen the detail.

LIPSON: You’re talking about having not seen the detail but you haven’t released  the detail and yet you’ve jumped on Labor for not supporting you earlier.

RYAN: I just heard Matt say that he did, sometimes people here are getting  confused between the dual and the sole national citizens but the important thing here  is the principle and the principle is that if someone has got two passports or dual  citizenship and someone’s committing acts that gravely endanger Australia’s safety  particularly domestically then what right does that person have to maintain their  citizenship of Australia? If we can make Australia safer by sending them to a place  where they hold other citizenship now back to the important principle we’ll see the  legislation it did mention it will have some judicial oversight and the Minister’s made

that clear, I don’t see why Gillian Triggs decided to criticise that without having seen  the detail, it was discussion on a principle.

LIPSON: Gentlemen, we’re out of time.
