E&OE……………………….……………………………………………………………

TONY ABBOTT:

It’s great to be here at the All Earth Group with Ken Wyatt the local member. This is a fine local business.  Thanks to this business about 150,000 tonnes of material that would otherwise end up in landfill is recycled  and I think this is a really, really important local business. Now, I’m going to ask Ken to say a bit about the  local business and then I’ve got a few other comments to make.

KEN WYATT:

Can I say that All Earth in recycling is creating the opportunity for the way in which we care for our  environment, certainly in terms of not seeing this material go into landfills, creating additional problems.  Their whole process is also factoring in and around community, and they’ve done a tremendous job, Tony,  in the way that they’re recycling and look it’s great to see concrete that was once buried now being used on  road verges.

TONY ABBOTT:

It’s great to hear Ken singing the praises of a fine local business like this and the whole problem with the  carbon tax is that it is going to impact on this and on hundreds of thousands of other local businesses right  around Australia. This business spends about $60,000 a year on power, that will just go up and up and up  under a carbon tax. This business spends about half a million dollars a year on fuel, that will just go up and  up and up under a carbon tax. This business is doing the right thing by the environment. It shouldn’t be  penalised by a tax which is supposedly for the environment. The carbon tax should not make recycling more  expensive and yet that’s precisely what will happen and this is a good example of precisely how the carbon  tax will have counterproductive effects for the environment.

I just want to make a few further points about the carbon tax. We see today some signs of lack of confidence  in the economic future of China. That is yet another sign of the international economic instability which  means that this is the worst possible time for a carbon tax. The latest ABS statistics show that power prices  have gone up eight per cent in just the last quarter. Again, it’s the worst possible time for a carbon tax. I

notice that the Prime Minister has been lecturing world leaders on what they need to do to save their  economies, to cut spending if you like, to reduce protection, and yet one thing she’s not saying to them is  introduce the world’s biggest carbon tax. Now, if she really believed that this was right for Australia why  isn’t she including this in her instructions to the rest of the world?

So every way you look at it the carbon tax is toxic. It’s bad for jobs, it’s bad for cost of living, it’s bad for  Australia’s international competitiveness and the Australian community needs to understand just how much  damage this Government is inflicting on them, just how much economic vandalism we are getting from this  Government.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, you say you’re going to repeal the carbon tax but will you repeal mandatory pre-commitment on  poker machines?

TONY ABBOTT:

The point I made last night was that we haven’t seen any legislation, it hasn’t gone to the shadow cabinet, it  hasn’t gone to the party room. But I do know my party room, I know the mood of my party, I know the  values and principles of my party, and we support more freedom not less and we are instinctively resistant to  anything that smacks of the nanny state. That’s why my prediction is that when the legislation does come  before us, if it comes before us, we will resolve to oppose it in opposition and rescind it in government. But I  do also want to make the point that the Labor Party is bitterly divided on this. It’s obvious that Labor  members of parliament, including Labor cabinet ministers, hate it. It’s very significant that when Kevin  Rudd was asked about this today he refused to comment because the word around the traps is that he’s using  this as part of his pitch to his caucus colleagues in his bid to get the numbers. So people need to understand  that the only reason the country is now considering mandatory pre-commitment is not because it’s in the  national interests but because it was necessary for the political survival of the Prime Minister. This is a  Prime Minister who has sold her soul to save her job.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, you said last night that the social fabric of society was at risk under the Government’s poker  machine reforms. You’re in Western Australia where there aren’t any poker machines. Is the social fabric of  society at risk here?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well I accept that the situation in Western Australia is a little different from the situation in New South  Wales, Queensland and to a lesser extent the other states, but in New South Wales certainly and in  Queensland to a great extent whole communities are very much, if not dependent they’re certainly  influenced by the community clubs movement. The community clubs movement is very, very important in  those states. For many, many decades now these community clubs in those states have had poker machines.  Sure, we need to do the right thing by problem gamblers. We need to do more to provide counselling for  them. We need to do more to try to ensure that we don’t see more problem gambling in new areas but there’s  no point taking action that does more harm than good and that’s my problem with mandatory pre-commitment. It won’t be effective against problem gamblers but it will do enormous damage to these  community clubs.

QUESTION:

But do you think it’s healthy that these clubs have to rely on gambling revenue? Is that healthy to the fabric  of society?

TONY ABBOTT:

What they’re relying on is people coming into their clubs and doing the kinds of things which free  Australians are accustomed to do. Now, no one should put more than he or she can afford into the poker  machines. No one should do that. Some people do and that is a matter of deep regret by everyone. The  question is how can we effectively deal with this without doing more harm than good and that’s the problem  with this mandatory pre-commitment. It will impose very high costs on our community, it will impose very  high establishment costs on these clubs but there’s no serious evidence that it is going to stop the problem  that it’s designed to address.

QUESTION:

But there’s no problem in WA with pokies so why such doom and gloom in the eastern states? We survive  without them; our clubs are fine.

TONY ABBOTT:

I accept the point that Western Australia is different but I don’t accept that because the club movement in  Western Australia is different to the club movement in the eastern states that we should willy-nilly inflict on  the club movement in the eastern states something that will do great damage to them and to all the  community organisations which depend upon them without necessarily doing anything much to help  problem gamblers.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, should Julia Gillard meet with the Sri Lankan President given that he’s been shrouded by war  crimes allegations?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, I think that the Prime Minister should meet with the other heads of government here at the  Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. I mean, if someone who is the head of government of a  Commonwealth country is good enough to come to Australia for this meeting, I think they are good enough  to meet the Prime Minister.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, a Sri Lankan asylum seeker committed suicide overnight. Do you think, despite being granted  refugee status a year ago he has been waiting for the process… Refugee advocates say that responsibility  lies with the minister. Do you agree with that?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, I think this is obviously a tragedy. We only just know of this tragedy. No doubt it will be fully  investigated and once those investigations have taken place if there’s anything more to say it will be said.

QUESTION:

Your policy is to keep asylum seekers in detention. Do you think that this particular refugee should have  been moved into the community considering his status had already been approved?

TONY ABBOTT:

The point I have made all along is that if you have policies in place which stop the boats you don’t have  people in detention. Now, that’s a general point that I am making. As for this particular individual, it is a  tragedy, just a tragedy and let’s not try to draw too many policy outcomes from what is an individual  tragedy.

QUESTION:

Just back on CHOGM, I think you are meeting with Stephen Harper at some stage of the event. He has said  that he might pull out of CHOGM in 2013 if it’s, it’s due to be held in Sri Lanka, if Sri Lanka doesn’t  improve its human rights record. Is that something Australia should consider also?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, there’s quite a lot of water to flow under the bridge between now and the next meeting of CHOGM. I  think the important thing is to get the best possible outcome from this meeting before we start worrying  about what might or might not happen at the next meeting. I do say though that it’s important for all  countries to pursue human decency. I think it’s important for all countries to treat their people fairly and  justly. Obviously one of the reasons why I’ve been so hostile to the so-called Malaysian people swap is  because people who come to our country, even illegally by boat, do become people to whom we have some  duty of care and we’ve got to discharge that in accordance with Australian standards of decency.

QUESTION:

Have you met with Malaysian representatives at all while you are here?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, my understanding is that I’ve got a pretty full programme of meetings with the representatives of  various Commonwealth countries and I’m looking forward to them all but as for the diary details I’m not  going to comment on them.
