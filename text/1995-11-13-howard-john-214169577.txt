J ohn Howard L e a d e r  of the O p p o s i t i o n LAUNCH OF CHINATOWN SPECIAL BRANCH

The Liberal Party's Chinatown Special Branch is another example of how  the Liberal Party and Australia's Chinese Community are a neat fit.

This new branch will expand the already sizeable role which all sections of  the Australian community play in the organisational and policy life of the  Liberal Party.

The Liberal Party is a Party for the great mainstream of Australian society.  This branch will continue the tradition of grass roots politics and policy  development within the Party.

The Liberal Party and Australia's Chinese community share deep values  such as respect for small business and enterprise, as well as recognising  the paramount importance of the family in our society.

W e share an understanding and appreciation for the enormous contribution  that ethnic communities have made to make our nation more exciting and  productive.

Liberals' record of commitment to immigration and an ethnically diverse  Australia are well based in the ending of the White Australia Policy by the  Holt Coalition Government and the Fraser Government's highest per capita  intake o f Indo-Chinese refugees in the world.

I am grateful to Helen Sham-Ho for her continuing hard work in forming  this branch. Helen's outstanding work in the Legislative Council of New  South Wales underlines the Liberal Party's close ties with Australia's ethnic  communities.

I look forward to the growth and success of the Chinatown Special Branch  of the Liberal Party.
