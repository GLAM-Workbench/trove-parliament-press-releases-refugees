TONY ABBOTT:

The Prime Minister rightly described the Australian War Memorial as Australia’s “pre-eminent temple of  honour” last night and it’s very important that our War Memorial never be short-changed by government.  Since 2007 the annual funding for the War Memorial has gone down from $38 million to just $30 million  and there have been very significant staff cuts as well. There’s even talk that without a serious funding  injection of closing one day a week, of charging for admission and charging for parking. This would be very  wrong because this memorial in its own way symbolises the heart and soul of our nation.

So I am calling on Prime Minister Gillard immediately to increase funding to the War Memorial by at least  $5 million a year. I think this is the least we can do in acknowledgement of the sacrifice of our soldiers and I  know the Government is looking at this but it’s been looking at it for quite a few months now. I think it’s  wrong that funding cuts to the War Memorial should overshadow ANZAC Day this year. I think it’s very  important that this funding should be sorted out right now and I call on the Prime Minister so to do.

I’m going to ask in a second my friends and colleagues Senator Ronaldson, the Shadow Minister for  Veterans’ Affairs to say a few words and also Senator Humphries, the senator for the ACT, but before I do I  should just also acknowledge the terrible disaster which has just struck Christchurch. Our thoughts and  prayers with the people of New Zealand right now. Millions of Australians have family and other links  across the Tasman. This is a very sad time and our hearts are with the people of New Zealand.

MICHAEL RONALDSON:

Thanks Tony. Ladies and gentlemen, just very quickly, obviously this is a terrific announcement that Tony  is making today. This is a matter that has caused community angst from one end of the country to the other  and it comes on the bank of further evidence of waste and mismanagement by the Labor Government. This  is $5 million that we believe is essential to maintain even basic services at the Australian War Memorial.  This matter has been debated now for five months. There’s meant to be an urgent inquiry. We learnt today in  senate estimates that it will only be considered in the context of the budget and Minister Wong has admitted  today that there hasn’t even been any consideration given as to whether there will be an increase in funds.

That’s not good enough, and the Australian community demands this. There’s 900,000 visitors a year to this  iconic institution and we want to make sure the doors remain open and it remains the pre-eminent institution  in this country. There’s $5 million. We have seen waste and mismanagement. The community demands  immediate action.

TONY ABBOTT:

Ok. Gary?

GARY HUMPHRIES:

Thanks, Tony. I very warmly welcome this decision. It’s appropriate and it’s timely. This is the most visited  institution in our national capital. It’s also the lowest funded and clearly it is struggling to deal with its  important national mission on behalf of all Australians and also deal with these Budget cuts.

I think this is a timely decision particularly in light of the fact that we are rapidly approaching the centenary  of the beginning of the First World War and the landing at Gallipoli and this institution needs the funds to  handle those commemorative occasions appropriately and this will put the Memorial on the track to do just  that.

TONY ABBOTT:

Ok. Alright, are there any questions?

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, would you urge Julia Gillard to send support to New Zealand straight away?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, I think it’s very important that the Australian Government responds appropriately. I’m sure that we  will be only too happy to meet any requests for assistance that the New Zealand Government might make.  All we know at the moment is that there has been a terrible disaster. Emergency services in New Zealand are  obviously responding as best they can and I’m sure our friends and family across the Tasman would want to  know that they will have all the support that Australia can give them.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, Ms Gillard said this morning that DFAT is beginning to look at evacuating civilians, Australian  citizens I should say from Libya. Is the Australian Government moving fast enough on this one?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think the important point to make about Libya is that the people of Libya deserve reform not repression.  They deserve reform not repression. My understanding is that there are about 100 Australians registered as  living in Libya and the Government, I’m sure, will and should do everything necessary to provide them with  support.

QUESTION:

One of your Coalition MPs said this morning that there are traitors in the ranks. Is that a fair way to describe  the situation? Do you have to do anything about it? And did this issue of immigration come up in the party  room meeting this morning?

TONY ABBOTT:



Well, first of all, there’s an official briefing out of the party room, which people will get from Senator  Brandis. I am busy holding the Government to account. Now, I know there are lots of people out there who  want to hold the Opposition to account but my job is to hold the Government to account. That’s what I am  doing every day. I’m holding the Government to account for its broken promises, for its addiction to  spending and taxing, for the fact that they are utterly incompetent in the delivery of programmes and for the  fact that they can’t even give the Australian War Memorial the $5 million a year more that it needs to  function effectively, but that they can waste billions on programmes which are not high priorities right now  and they can waste tens of millions on advertising programmes that don’t even begin. So, I’m holding the  Government to account today and every day.

QUESTION:

Is Scott Morrison politicising the asylum seekers debate?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think that Scott Morrison is doing a really outstanding job highlighting the Government’s border protection  failures. We have had more than 200 illegal boats, we’ve had more than 10,000 illegal entrants since the  Rudd-Gillard Government watered down the former Government’s policies that worked. Now, I think Scott  has done a really outstanding job holding the Government to account. Obviously the Government knows that  it is vulnerable here and that’s why it is running the red herrings that we are now seeing.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, [inaudible] the only thing saving this bad Labor Government is disunity in the Coalition? Was  that aimed at the traitors in the ranks and why did you feel the need to say that?

TONY ABBOTT:

As I said, my job is to hold the Government to account and every day I’m doing that. Today, for instance,  I’m holding the Government to account for its failure to properly fund this great national icon and that’s my  job and that’s what I will be doing every day.

QUESTION:

But on the disunity in the party that you spoken about, who is that aimed at and why did you need to say it?

TONY ABBOTT:

As I said, there’ll be an official briefing out of the party room. It happens every Tuesday and it will happen  today in the ordinary course of business and, as for me, I’m here to hold the Government to account for its  failure to adequately fund this great national shrine.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, [inaudible] has Scott Morrison to the backbench. They also tried to imply that in some way the  Coalition is racist. How do you respond to that?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, I’ve always made three points absolutely crystal clear. I did it last week and let me do it again now.  Australia is the world’s most successful immigrant society. The Coalition fully supports a multicultural  Australia and the Coalition will always support a non-discriminatory immigration policy.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, has the Coalition got its messaging wrong on this debate though given your dip in Newspoll  today?

TONY ABBOTT:

I’m focusing on the field evidence and the field evidence is that we’ve got a Government which is just  chronically incompetent. Every day you see more examples of this Government’s failure. The Prime  Minister said repeatedly late last year that this was going to be the year of decision and delivery. Already on  one of those subjects she’s decided not to deliver, that’s to say on hospital reform, and plainly what we’re  going to see from this Government is a year of backflips and broken promises.

QUESTION:

Just on the HMAS Success, are you disturbed by some of the stories coming out in that inquiry today?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, I haven’t heard any additional stories and I’ll wait to I’ve heard them before I comment on them.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, just on War Memorial matters, Steve Gower, the director of the memorial has been waiting for  months to find out whether or not he is going to be reappointed. Maybe Senator Ronaldson is better to  answer but I mean should the Government clear this up? He’s been there since 1995, isn’t it some time to  actually give him some peace of mind?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, the important thing is that the War Memorial is adequately funded and staffed and that’s why the  Coalition has made a commitment to provide the War Memorial with the funding that it needs. That will  enable the staffing that it needs and I call upon the Prime Minister to end the procrastination and  immediately make clear that the War Memorial will get the $5 million a year extra that it needs.

QUESTION:

What about all the other cultural institutions in Canberra? They are all facing massive funding cuts. It’s not  just the War Memorial, what about those?

TONY ABBOTT:

The War Memorial as I understand it is the most visited but the least funded major cultural institution here  in our capital. That’s why it is very, very important that the Government end the uncertainty, end the  procrastination and give the memorial the money it needs now.
