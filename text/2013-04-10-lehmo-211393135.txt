BRIG:

It’s a great pleasure to have in the studio, in the flesh - just panting a little bit from doing the two flights up  - Mr Tony Abbott. Hello, Tony.

LEHMO:

‘Morning, Tony.

TONY ABBOTT:

Brig, Lehmo, Joe. Lovely to be here, thanks for having me.

BRIG:

Now, you’re looking as smart as paint today. You’re wearing a blue tie. Now, is blue the power colour or…?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, it’s sort of my uniform - dark suit, white shirt, blue tie is kind of my uniform and I figure if I look  more or less the same every day, people won’t be distracted by my appearance and they will listen to what I  have to say.

LEHMO:

So, you’re not tempted to chuck on a flamboyant white suit one day?

TONY ABBOTT:

No, no, no. I’ll leave that to people in show biz.

BRIG:



I reckon a Don Johnson would be alright, just casually.

LEHMO:

I think it’d look good. Now Tony, the Prime Minister, she’s in China at the moment and you’ve got to say -  you have to give her this - it’s been a successful trip, hasn’t it?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, the Chinese have certainly made our Prime Minister welcome, they’ve made the big delegation of  business leaders with her very welcome and that’s good. It’s important that our leaders travel abroad and I  welcome the Prime Minister’s trip. I think we have somewhat neglected the relationship but it’s good that  she’s now making an effort to put it back on a good footing.

LEHMO:

She’s done well because the direct trading of the currency is great, there’ll now be annual meetings and I  believe Russia and Germany are the only other two countries with this agreement in place.

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, when I was in Beijing last July, I very strongly urged and that there be an annual leadership dialogue  at the top level of business and politics between Australia and China and it seems that that idea is now  coming to fruition, so that’s great.

BRIG:

My children are learning Chinese at school as their language. Do you think that’s a good pick for future  business types?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think it’s very important for general cultural literacy that people are encouraged to study a foreign  language. Now, I’m ashamed to say that when I was at school I studied French, Latin and Ancient Greek and  I’ve forgotten all of them.

BRIG:

But you can say Bonjour, or S’il vous plait?

TONY ABBOTT:

Peut-ÃÂªtre!

BRIG:

Oh, that’s fabulous.

LEHMO:

Because Latin and Ancient Greek would come in handy, wouldn’t it?

TONY ABBOTT:

Anyway, so I think it’s great that we’re studying foreign languages. I think Asian languages are good.  Mandarin is terrific. Bahasa is great. Of course, Japanese is an excellent language to have. But in the end,  it’s cultural literacy that we need because whether we are talking to the Chinese in their language or in ours,  the important thing is that it’s a sensitive, courteous, candid conversation.

BRIG:

Back on the serious stuff with the asylum seekers, we’ve had another boat come in. What do we do now? I  mean, it’s just getting ridiculous.

TONY ABBOTT:

It is. It is, Brig. It just gets worse and worse all the time and I think effectively the Government has kind of  surrendered and the problem with surrendering on boat people is that in the end it discredits the whole of our  immigration programme and that is a tragedy, an absolute tragedy, because Australia has been built on  migration, particularly on skilled migration and we want migrants to feel absolutely welcome in this country  when they are making a contribution from day one, as so many of them do, particularly the ones that come  on 457 visas. So, it’s a disaster. The Howard Government found a problem and created a solution. The  Rudd-Gillard Government found a solution and created a problem. It gets worse every day.

LEHMO:

So, Manus Island and Nauru are disasters…

TONY ABBOTT:

No, they’re steps in the right direction. The tragedy is that they weren’t available from day one. Now, we’ve  got to have rigorous offshore processing. We’ve got to have temporary protection visas to deny the people  smugglers a product to sell. We’ve got to have the option of turning boats around and the Sri Lankans are  certainly turning boats around - they’re not getting all of them but they’re certainly turning them around  when they get them - and we’ve got to have a much better relationship with Indonesia because about 80 per  cent of the arrivals, at times more, are coming via Indonesia and we need to have the kind of relationship  with Indonesia that allows proper interdiction of would-be illegal arrivals by boat.

BRIG:

Ok, now I need to ask you about the new dog toy that’s being sold at an Adelaide pet shop called ‘Droolia  Julia’. I’m not sure if you’ve seen this, Tony, but it’s basically a doll with red hair and oversized breasts  being sold in Adelaide and there’s a picture of a dog with, you know, its mouth around its neck. What do  you make of that?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, I think the Prime Minister probably has sufficient sense of humour to cope. You know, we are a  cheeky, disrespectful people and I’ve seen models and kind of caricature toys of different politicians over  the years…

BRIG:

Have you seen Grabbit Abbott?

TONY ABBOTT:

I haven’t, but I can remember there used to be sort of squeezy dolls of Pauline Hanson and things like that.  So, look, you know, I think it is part of our rough, cheeky way and as I said, whatever faults the Prime

Minister has, the last time we spoke she hadn’t completely lost her sense of humour and I don’t think she’s  going to be too heartbroken.

JOE:

Alright, Tony Abbott, Opposition Leader is with us this morning. We’ll talk about the NBN, obviously the  Coalition’s approach announced yesterday, and your chance to speak to Tony right now if you’d like to call  us up and you’ve got a question. 9414 1043 and Tony’s about to look through our music list and choose a  classic hit.

LEHMO:

Great.

JOE:

He’s going to play one of his favourite songs straight after this on Gold 104.3.

TONY ABBOTT:

And Joe, where’s the King? I mean, why is Elvis not on your list?!

JOE:

Oh, come on.

TONY ABBOTT:

Is this an Elvis-free zone?!

**Advertisement break**

JOE:

Here’s your chance to ask Opposition Leader Tony Abbott anything you’d like. Our number is 9414 1043.  He’s chosen a classic hit for us guys.

LEHMO:

Tony, we’ve let you delve into our playlist. This is a privilege that not even we get. What have you chosen?

TONY ABBOTT:

Knowing me, Knowing you!

BRIG:

ABBA! See, he’s a father of three daughters.

LEHMO:

Ok, is there a reason why? You had an extensive list of songs to choose from.

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, ABBA was one of those standbys of one’s uni days and it was always one way of getting the party  going and the girls all loved ABBA.

LEHMO:

Did it guarantee to get you on the dance floor?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, I was always light on my partner’s feet, as it were!

BRIG:

You’ll be dancing.

JOE:

Exactly, some dancing in the studios - ABBA. More from Opposition Leader Tony Abbott next on Gold  104.3.

**Song break**

JOE:

7.23 and a song for Tony Abbott this morning. It took him back to 1977.

BRIG:

Yes, ABBA. Who would have thought?

TONY ABBOTT:

Reliving my uni days; my misspent youth.

LEHMO:

Just to bring our listeners into the fold, Tony did start dancing in the studio and he is…

TONY ABBOTT:

Tapping my feet, at least.

LEHMO:

…very light of foot. Now, Tony, I get frustrated by the slow service the internet provides in this country and  the Government has proposed the NBN rollout. We’re all very excited about that. You proposed yours  yesterday. Is the Coalition government bringing us a slower internet? Is this what’s happening?

TONY ABBOTT:

The short answer no and let me start by saying nothing is slower than the NBN rollout under Labor. They’ve  been going for four years. So far, they’ve passed about 100,000 houses out of 12 million in Australia and  there’s only about 10,000 live connections to the NBN.

BRIG:

Why is it so slow?

TONY ABBOTT:

Because of poor management and because the concept is bad. If you are trying to create brand new  connections to 12 million households, that is a much bigger job than simply rolling out fibre to 10 or 20,000  nodes and that’s why what we are proposing - fibre to the end of the street as it were, rather than to your  front door - what we are proposing is much swifter to rollout and much more affordable. We think that  every Australian household can have five times the current download speeds within three years and 10 times  the current download speeds within six years.

LEHMO:

So, that proposal will be as fast as what we’ll get under the NBN?

TONY ABBOTT:

We will get - 90 per cent of households will get 50 to 100 megabit downloads under our proposal and they  will get it for about one third of the cost of the rollout of Labor’s broadband.

BRIG:

Alright a couple of callers for you here, Tony. Marion from Berwick. Go ahead, Marion.

CALLER:

Hello Mr Abbott, how are you?

TONY ABBOTT:

G’day Marion.

CALLER:

I wanted to ask you about the private health insurance rebate. The Government has eroded that and as a  result there is now an increase in the public health system. What do you plan to do about it?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, as you know, Marion, the Howard Government, the Coalition, did introduce the private health  insurance rebate and…

CALLER:

And I am glad you did.

TONY ABBOTT:

…we are absolutely committed to it. We would like to fully restore it but given the fact that Costello’s four  biggest surpluses in Australia’s history have been replaced by Swan’s four biggest deficits in Australia’s  history we can’t put a time frame on it. We will make no further adverse changes but fully restoring the  rebate will take a bit of time and I know this is disappointing, Marion.

CALLER:

No, as long as you plan to do it that’s great.

TONY ABBOTT:

We do plan to do it. I just can’t put a time frame on it at the moment.

BRIG:

Alright, thank you Marion and Joe from Healesville. Go ahead, Joe.

CALLER:

Good morning, Tony.

TONY ABBOTT:

G’day Joe.

CALLER:

I was just wondering what your plans are for the auto industry? I work in the auto industry but I am not  directly affected by Toyota, Holden or Ford. We seem to be bailing them out all the time but we are giving  them very little incentive to compete against the other manufacturers and I dare say with Julia’s trip to China  there is going to be more Chinese vehicle imports in the near future.

TONY ABBOTT:

Joe, look, that’s a fair point. If we abolish the carbon tax we will reduce the cost impost on the average  Australian-produced car by $400. That’s what the industry has estimated the carbon tax is adding to the  price of an Australian- manufactured car. So, that is a step in the right direction.

I want to see the motor industry survive and flourish in this country. What we have got to do over time is get  it more geared to export because our motor plants, particularly Ford, are really only manufacturing for the  domestic industry, for the domestic market, and given domestic demand they tend to be getting a smaller  and smaller share.

Now, there is nothing wrong with the cars we are manufacturing. I mean, the Ford Territory which I drive is  a terrific vehicle, a terrific vehicle. I was with a few people from Geelong last night and they were all saying  you have got to do something to look after the motor industry and I said how many of you guys drive a  Territory? Well, I am afraid I was the only one who put my hand up. You know, if you want to keep the  motor industry in Geelong, please go out and make your next car a Ford Territory. It’s a great car, you will  be thrilled.

So, over time we need to get the Australian motor manufacturers much more committed to export and that is  what continuing government subsidy should involve - making sure they have a serious export plan.

LEHMO:

So, you would commit to saving the auto industry? Because at the moment it has been diminishing rapidly  over the last few years. We have seen thousands of people lose their jobs.

TONY ABBOTT:

Yes and the terrible paradox was the government giving additional subsidies to these companies saying that  employment would increase and a few months later employment actually goes down, not up. Look, I am  committed to continuing support for the motor industry but I want the support to be matched by a  commitment from the manufacturers to an export plan so they get their volumes up.

BRIG:

Alright Tony we have got to let you go but just a personal question first. I’m sure you’re nervous. I often  wonder how, and how Julia Gillard, how politicians in your position cope with the negativity that can come  through? How do you keep yourself up when you are getting a lot of negative feedback or negative  comments? And it is a tough job on either side.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I come on a high-rating radio programme like this!

BRIG:

Ah, good answer! Excellent answer.

LEHMO:

If you want to preserve your popularity this is the place to be.

BRIG:

And when you come and see us when you’re Prime Minister; if you’re Prime Minister?

TONY ABBOTT:

Of course.

BRIG:

Ok, we’ve got that now on tape! Alright, Tony Abbott thank you very much for joining us today and we will  speak to you again soon, no doubt.

TONY ABBOTT:

Brig and Lehmo, it has been terrific and Joe thanks for having us in the studio. Nice to be here.
