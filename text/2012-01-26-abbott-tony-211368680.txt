E&OE……………………….……………………………………………………………

TONY ABBOTT:

Look it’s great to be here at Sydney Opera House on Australia Day. It was close to this spot on the 26th of  January 1788 that modern Australia began. Our country is not perfect but it is the greatest country on earth  and every year Australians should strive to make a great country even better.

This is a day to count our blessings. It’s a day to reflect on what has made us a great nation and yes it is a  day to resolve to be even better in the weeks and months and years ahead.

Today I am here to announce an initiative from the Coalition that I think will materially help our country in  the years ahead. Every year about 80 people drown on Australian beaches. Also every year, thanks to the  marvellous work of our lifesavers, volunteer and paid, thousands and thousands of people are rescued.

Today I announce that over the next five years the Coalition will make an additional $10 million available to  our lifesaving services through Lifesaving Australia and this will provide more much needed equipment to  the 300 plus surf lifesaving clubs right around our country.

These volunteers are great people. They’re the salt of the earth. They embody what’s best about Australia.  It’s important that they are supported by all levels of government and this is a sign of the Coalition’s  determination to keep more Australians alive by supporting the surf lifesaving movement.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, today is also the 40th anniversary of the Tent Embassy in Canberra. Is the Tent Embassy still  relevant or should it move?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, I can understand why the Tent Embassy was established all those years ago. I think a lot has changed  for the better since then. We had the historic apology just a few years ago, one of the genuine achievements

of Kevin Rudd as Prime Minister. We had the proposal which is currently for national consideration to  recognise indigenous people in the Constitution. I think the indigenous people of Australia can be very  proud of the respect in which they are held by every Australian and yes, I think a lot has changed since then  and I think it probably is time to move on from that.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, what do you think about the plagiarism allegations against Mr Albanese?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, you know I just think that Michael Douglas is much better at it than Albo and I’m surprised that a  government minister hasn’t actually blamed me for it. Somehow I manage to substitute scripts in Albo’s  speech because everything else seems to be my fault. Look, I think basically what it shows is that this a  government which has no ideas of its own for the improvement of Australia. That’s why they rely on a  clapped-out script from Hollywood.

QUESTION:

You’d think he would’ve proof read it and double checked it.

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, it is a pretty embarrassing gaffe by the Leader of the House. I just hope he lifts his game.

QUESTION:

Do you think he should resign over the comments?

TONY ABBOTT:

I don’t lightly call on people to resign. All of us make mistakes from time to time but this is a pretty  embarrassing one and it is emblematic of a government that has no real ideas of its own.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, during the week the Prime Minister made reference to your quote, “relentless negativity”. Do  you think that’s a fair description of your take on most of their ideas?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, every day I’m talking about our positive ideas for our country and just today I have a positive  announcement that will improve lifesaving services right around Australia. Everyday I’m talking about how  we can reduce taxes, how we can cut red tape, how we can improve productivity. Sure, I’m also talking  about the faults of a bad government getting worse but there is a better way. On today of all days I think we  need to be talking about hope, reward and opportunity for all Australians.

QUESTION:

What do you make of Geoffrey Rush’s comments that local filmmakers should be making movies about the  asylum seeker issue? He’s saying that it’s become a political football but is this grandstanding it a little too  much?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think Geoffrey Rush is a fine Australian of the Year. I think he has been a great actor. I think he’s been an  adornment to our country. I was really, really impressed as I think so many people right around the world  were with his performance in The King’s Speech which was a really outstanding, a beautiful film which I  think it really impressed audiences. In fact, it’s one of the very few films that I can remember being at where  the audience just stood and applauded at the end of the screening that I saw. So look, I think he’s a fine  choice as Australian of the Year. I’ll leave him to talk about the world of arts and what artists might want to  cover. As I said, I think a fine choice as Australian of the Year.

QUESTION:

Yesterday you made comments about open cut mining perhaps being worse for the environment than coal  seam gas mining. Do you fully understand the fears that farmers have about coal seam gas?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, I fully understand farmers’ desire to protect their land and I support them. I absolutely support them.  The last thing we ought to be doing is something which gives us a bonanza for 20 or 30 years but  impoverishes us for all time. It is very important that the development of the coal seam gas industry does not  come at the expense of prime agricultural land, does not come at the expense of damage to our water table.  Now, I hope that they can co-exist and certainly, for a couple of decades now in Queensland, they have co-existed but I think we do need to be careful. As someone once very, very wisely said, when you’re driving in  fog you turn the lights on and you slow down.

QUESTION:

Nonetheless, several people within the Coalition have voiced concerns about coal seam gas and that perhaps  it’s not the way ahead.

TONY ABBOTT:

I think it is very important that we get the balance right here, very important that we get the balance right. I  congratulate Barry O’Farrell, the New South Wales Premier, for the cautious approach he has adopted and  I’m confident that should there be a change of government in Queensland Campbell Newman will adopt the  same careful, cautious balanced approach.

QUESTION:

Just back on your policy announcement, can you go into a bit more detail about where the money’s coming  from, how it will be rolled out. I understand there’s 300 clubs involved.

TONY ABBOTT:

Yeah look the money will be effectively administered by Surf Life Saving Australia and it will come from  savings in the budget. Going into the last election we announced some $50 billion worth of savings and I’m  confident that we can find this $10 million from savings in the budget now.

QUESTION:

Do you have any plans to travel to Queensland in the coming weeks for the election campaign?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, if I can help Campbell Newman, I will. I travel often to Queensland. I get on very well with  Campbell. I think Campbell is going to be a great Premier of Queensland but I’ll wait until I’m invited.

QUESTION:

Do you think he has a good chance of winning the election?

TONY ABBOTT:

I know that he is taking nothing for granted and the Coalition never takes anything for granted but yes, I  think the Bligh Government has been good at PR but it’s been very bad at delivering for the people of  Queensland and I think a lot of people are desperately, desperately yearning for a change of government in  Brisbane, just as they’re yearning for a change of government in Canberra.

Thanks so much.
