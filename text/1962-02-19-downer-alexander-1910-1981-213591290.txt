IMMIGRATION. Â·  '  '

A girl who came to Australia only 10 years ago as a

refugee migrant will today be Guest of Honour at an international

diplomatic, reception in the famous Palais’  des Nations in Geneva.

She is Miss Tania Verstak, Miss Australia for 1961.

As one of Australia's most distinguished - and beautiful-

migrants she will meet representatives of 35 different governments

and 50 voluntary agencies who are specially concerned in the

migration of refugees,

The reception will have perhaps the most spectacular

backdrop scenery in Europe - it will be held in a vast salon

overlooking Lake Geneva, with snow-capped Mont Blanc mirrored

in the waters of the lake.

The function is being arranged jointly by the Australian

Government, the' United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees

and the Intergovernmental Committee for European Migration.

.  On behalf of the Minister for Immigration, Mr. Downer,

"Miss Australia" will present scrolls bearing messages to the

United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Mr. Felix Schnyder,

and the Director of I.C.E.M., Mr. B. Haveman, as a gesture of

Australia's appreciation of their work in helping to settle

refugees.  i

The messages are hand-inscribed on parchment and will be

framed for hanging in the Geneva headquarters of both organisatÂ­

ions. After the reception, "Miss Australia" will face television

cameras - the T.V. film will be distributed world-wide - radio

microphones, a battery of press cameras, and will be interviewed

by international journalists stationed in Geneva as well as

Swiss reporters.  On arrival in Geneva "Miss Australia" will be

met by Mr. and Mrs. Peter Henderson on behalf, of the Australian

Consulate-General.  Ã¢ÂÂ

During the afternoon the delegates from the governments

and voluntary agencies will attend a special seminar on refugee

problems.  The Chief Medical Officer at the Australian Migration

Office in Rome, Dr. F .  Jensen, will deliver a preliminary report

to the seminar on the results of a survey he has been making of

handicapped refugges living in ItalyÂ·?,  who wish to migrate.

Dr. Jensen is compiling complete medical data on their

physical and mental health to determine their aptitude for

resettlement.  The Australian Government made Dr. Jensen's

service.s available for this project.
