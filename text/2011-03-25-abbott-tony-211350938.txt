E&OE……………………….…………………………………………………………………

KARL STEFANOVIC:

Good Morning to you Tony.

TONY ABBOTT:

GÃ¢ÂÂday Karl.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

Now, youÃ¢ÂÂre attendance at the anti-carbon tax rally has caused a bit of a stir this week. LetÃ¢ÂÂs take a look.

TONY ABBOTT:



As I look out on this crowd of fine Australians, I want to say that I do not see scientific heretics, I do  not see environmental vandals, I see people who want honest government.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

Tony, was it an error in judgment?

TONY ABBOTT:

No and I think it would have been good for the Prime Minister to have fronted that audience and explained  her position to them and I think people are entitled to be more than a little disappointed with a Government  and a Prime Minister that has broken its word that there would be no carbon tax under the government I  lead.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

Why wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt you apologise to her for those signs?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, plainly they were tacky, some of them, but how can I apologise for something I didn't do?

KARL STEFANOVIC:

What about for the offence that they may have caused her?

TONY ABBOTT:

And I made the point that they were tacky; a couple of them were nasty. They shouldn't have been used, but  in the end, Karl, we can argue until the cows come home about tacky placards; this is really about the big hit  on struggling familiesÃ¢ÂÂ cost of living and thatÃ¢ÂÂs why I think people are entitled to be pretty resentful of a  Prime Minister who wasn't truthful with them before the election.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

There is certainly heat between you two; you could see that in parliament yesterday. Fairfax reports that  Tony Abbott says Julia Gillard is a multi-faceted liar who lacks integrity and is being precious about a few  nasty placards and the Prime Minister believes Mr Abbott to be a disgusting and revolting individual who  has displayed flawed judgment by associating himself with extremism and gross sexism. Pretty fair  assessment of how your relationship is at the moment?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well look Karl, I'm afraid Julia stopped coming on the programme and that personal rapport that we seemed  to have in those days, alas, has disappeared. But Karl look, this would all be different if the Prime Minister  hadn't said, six days before the last election "there will be no carbon tax under the Government I lead". Now,  even prime ministers are entitled to change their mind and what the Prime Minister should do is seek a  mandate for her carbon tax at the next election. That would be the fair and the honest and the decent thing to  do. Instead, she's trying to ram it through in a parliament where only one person, the Green, went to the  election saying Ã¢ÂÂlet's have a carbon taxÃ¢ÂÂ.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

There's a lot of heat in this debate, as you know only too well. I just can't help but think at the moment that  Ã¢ÂÂhang on a second, does everyone need to chill out in regards to this issue and get the facts sorted out, try  and just relax a little bit and get all those facts and figures compiled before we start biting each other's heads  off?Ã¢ÂÂ

TONY ABBOTT:

But Karl, the essential fact is that the Prime Minister said six days before the election “thereÃ¢ÂÂll be no carbon  tax under the Government I lead”. Now there is going to be a carbon tax and instead of doing the right thing  in seeking a mandate for this new position, sheÃ¢ÂÂs trying to ram it through in a parliament where no-one said,  except for the one single solitary Green member, that there was going to be a carbon tax and this is why  people feel so ripped off. They think that the real Prime Minister is actually Bob Brown.

KARL STEFANAVIC:

It doesnÃ¢ÂÂt seem to helping you in the polls, your stance on climate change, is that a bit of a surprise to you?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, I think polls go up and down, Karl, but what wonÃ¢ÂÂt change is my opposition to a bad tax based on a lie  and, as I said, if the Prime Minister wants to do the decent thing, she would seek a mandate for this new tax  at the next election. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs what John Howard did in 1998 with the GST. This change is even bigger than the  GST. The $300 hit on your power bill is just for starters, the 6.5 cent a litre a hit on your petrol bill for  starters, the $6,240 on the cost of a new home is just for starters.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

The Australian carries a story, moving on now, that asylum seekers picked up by customs vessels are  deliberately being ordered off at Ashmore Reef, ever so briefly, so they lose their legal rights before being  brought to the mainland. Your thoughts on that story?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well Karl, I think that this is a Government which has lost control of our borders. I think that the Howard  Government put policies in place which stopped the boats, and I think that they should not have been  scrapped by this Government, and if this Government wants to stop the boats it has got to deny the people  smugglers a product to sell and the sorts of policies that we are advocating are the sorts of policies it should  have the courage to adopt.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

Alright there was quite interesting there, a customs spokeswomen said last night that we can confirm that the  ACV Trident went to Ashmore Islands and the passengers were given the opportunity to disembark on West  Island. It sounds like a P&O Cruise.

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, plainly this whole thing is a fiddle by Government which is resorting to desperate stratagems. I mean,  the Prime Minister said 10 days ago that the situation at Christmas Island was in hand, and since then the  centre has been partially destroyed by rioting. So, this is a Government which really is literally all at sea.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

Nice pun. Have you been working on that?

TONY ABBOTT:

Mate, this is what happens early in the morning, you know?

KARL STEFANOVIC:

Now you criticised Julia Gillard, just finally, for going to the royal wedding because she doesn't believe in  God, the monarchy or marriage and is that because you are a little bit jealous that you are not going, Tony?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, IÃ¢ÂÂm sure my invitation has got lost in the post, Karl, and I go to the letterbox every day eagerly  opening things, but so far all I'm getting is bills.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

Like the rest of us. I'm hearing you. And finally, Cyndi Lauper is performing later on the show, your  favourite Cyndi Lauper song?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, you know, I'm a bit too retro for Cyndi, you know.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

What?!

TONY ABBOTT:

I want to bring back the King, the Big O, you know. Re-form the Traveling Wilburys.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

Good idea. Thanks Tony, have a good week.

TONY ABBOTT:

Thanks Karl.
