MINISTER ANNOUNCES DETAILS 
OF 1998-99 HUMANITARIAN PROGRAM

Â

Â

The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock, 
today announce d details of the composition of the 12,000 places 
allocated under the 1998-99 Humanitarian Program for refugees and displaced 
people.

Â

“A total of 4,000 places are for refugees, of which 
420 places will be for women at risk. This reflects the priority we 
give to this group,” said Mr Ruddock.

Â

“In addition, priority is also given to the reunion 
of immediate family members of humanitarian entrants and protection 
visa holders under special provisions introduced by the Government last 
year.”

Â

The program also includes an estimated:

Â

*Â 2,000 places 
for people found to be refugees in Australia

Â

*Â 4,250 Special 
Humanitarian Program (SHP) places for people found to be experiencing 
substantial discrimination amounting to gross violation of human rights; 
and

Â

*Â 1,750  
Special Assistance Category (SAC) places.

Â

“While the overall size of the program is the same as in 1997-98, 
we are working closely with the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Refugees to ensure the program remains targeted to those in greatest 
need of r esettlement in Australia,” Mr Ruddock said.

Â

The Minister said that the former Yugoslavia remains 
the largest regional component of the program despite a small reduction 
as a result of implementation of the Dayton Peace Accords. However, 
developments in the former Yugoslavia will continue to be closely monitored. 
The Middle East and Africa also remain high priority areas for the program.

Â

“The 1998-99 Humanitarian Program continues the 
Government’s commitment to deliver an effective and well-targeted 
program, which puts the settlement needs of bona fide refugees first,” 
Mr Ruddock said.
