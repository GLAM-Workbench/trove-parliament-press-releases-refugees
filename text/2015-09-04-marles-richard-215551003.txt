THE HON RICHARD MARLES MP  SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND BORDER  PROTECTION   MEMBER FOR CORIO





STATEMENT ON EUROPEAN REFUGEE CRISIS

The refugee crisis unfolding in Europe is deeply concerning. The number of refugees  and migrants crossing Europe represents the largest movement of displaced people  since the Second World War.

During this time of global humanitarian crisis, the response from Australia should be  of  increasing  humanitarian  funding  to  the  UNHCR,  instead  under  the  Abbott   Government funding has been cut to the UNHCR.

Labor believes Australia needs to do more to address this humanitarian crisis and a  Shorten Labor Government will provide significantly increased annual funding to the  UNHCR.

Labor will provide $450 million over three years to support the important work of the  UNHCR.  This  funding  commitment  would  place  Australia  in  the  top  5  of  global   contributors to the UNHCR.

Australia must show leadership, decency and compassion in response to this crisis  and provide financial support to help the UNHCR do its vital work.
