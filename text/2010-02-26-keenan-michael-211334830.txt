KEVIN RUDD'S SUMMER OF BOATS

Mr Scott Morrison MP

Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship



Mr Michael Keenan MP

Shadow Minister for Justice and Customs

Joint Media Release.

Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Scott Morrison and Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and

Border Protection, Michael Keenan said the arrival of the latest illegal boat, carrying 45 passengers and 2 crew,

makes it 28 illegal arrivals in Kevin Rudd’s summer of boats, seven times as many boats as arrived last summer.

“Last summer 4 boats arrived carrying 144 people. Now, with people smugglers influenced by the full effects of

Kevin Rudd’s magnetic immigration policies and the Oceanic Viking special deal, 28 boats have arrived with

1,361 people on board, almost ten times the number of people last summer,” Mr Morrison said.

“Not even the forces of nature in form of the dangerous monsoon season can counteract the magnetic impact of

Kevin Rudd's failed policies. Boats continue to arrive illegally every week.

“Labor is simply not up to fixing this huge problem. Their heart is not in it.

“Under Labor 95% of those who arrive at Christmas Island are given permanent visas. This is a very high strike

rate, particularly when the most recent data on acceptance rates from the UNHCR is 81%. ”

Mr Keenan said: “The avalanche of arrivals this year has exposed gaping holes in Australia's border protection.

“Border Protection Command is stretched beyond capacity under the new average of three boat arrivals a week,

which has allowed this latest boat to slip through a stones throw from Christmas Island.”
