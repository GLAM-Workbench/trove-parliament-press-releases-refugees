SUBJECTS:  IMF, Australian economy, war on terror

JOURNALIST:

Well Treasurer, in regards to the IMF report, if our major trading partners are suffering reduced growth, how long can Australia remain immune from this global recession?

TREASURER:

Well, Australia has out-performed the world in 2001.  Our economy has been growing, and growing strongly - notwithstanding America is in recession, Japan is in recession, much of Europe has slowed to a halt.  So, the good news is, we are out-performing the world.  The bad news is that the world is very slow.  All of the major centres of economic growth [inaudible] Australia have turned down. I think there is quite a degree of resilience in the domestic Australian economy, but we hope that the world will come back, and come back quickly.

JOURNALIST:

On that point, Treasury has growth at 4 per cent.  The IMF says 3.3.  Who is right?

TREASURER:

I think our forecast for financial year 2001-02 is 3.  That was what we put down in the Mid Year Review.  The IMF, of course, is forecasting mostly on a calendar year for 2002, and I think our

growth forecasts are pretty consistent when you make allowances for the different financial year and the calendar year.

JOURNALIST:

So it’s really semantics?  Is that right?

TREASURER:

Well, what the IMF is saying is what we are saying.  We expect considerable growth in Australia through 2001 and into 2002.  We have said that for the financial year, around 3 per cent.  And we think that there are good prospects into 2002-2003.  The forecasts that we put down in the Mid Year Review are the most up-to-date forecasts, and we will not look at those again until Budget time.

JOURNALIST:

How much is Australia’s economic performance bolstered by the construction sector, and surely that will come off midway through next year?

TREASURER:

A good deal of …  Why is Australia growing when the United States is in recession and Japan is in recession?  One of the key reasons is that consumer sentiment is strong and people, because of tax cuts which we put in place in 2000, have more money to spend.  Because of low interest rates, which means they are paying less on their mortgage, they have got more money to spend.  And because we introduced a First Home Buyers Scheme that has stimulated the construction industry. So, one of the reasons why Australia has been able to defy the world downturn is that we have kept our domestic economy strong.  And stronger than the United States and Japan and Europe.  Now, that will keep the Australian economy growing into 2002.  It would help us if the world picks up. At the moment, we are the strongest growing economy in the industrialised world.  It would help us if the world picked up.  And I hope that the world economy will pick up in 2002.

JOURNALIST:

Treasury’s got forecasts for 2002-03 at 3.5 per cent - which is a fair bit more than the 3 per cent that you forecast for this year.  Is that looking over-optimistic in the current circumstances?

TREASURER:

No, I am not sure that it is.  That is the best forecast that we can lay down for 2002-03, financial 2002-03.  The most recent September quarter was 1.1 per cent, which annualised is a growth rate over 4 per cent.  So there is considerable strength out there in the Australian economy.  And there will be strength, obviously, going into the New Year.  And that will carry us through into 2002. You asked me what the situation will be like in 2003?  Well, it depends to a large degree on the world economy.  The world economy has dipped and the Australian economy is strong.  But you cannot expect to be immune from international developments.  I think they probably have clipped a bit off our growth rate.  But the good news is, we have continued to grow.  We are the strongest growing economy in 2001 in the developed world.  And I hope all Australians, I think all Australians, will hope that continues.

JOURNALIST:

You’ve promised a Budget surplus.  Will you be able to deliver?

TREASURER:

We have now delivered five consecutive Budget surpluses, and we have now repaid nearly $60 billion of the Labor Party’s debt.  And that has been very important to keeping the Australian economy strong.  So we want to keep a good fiscal policy going.  Yes, we do.  Yes, we do.

JOURNALIST:

Just having a look overseas.

TREASURER:

Last question.

JOURNALIST:

Yes.  The war on terror, obviously.  How does Australia fit in with the budgetary constraints if we are going to be part of an international peace keeping force?  Can we afford to do that?

TREASURER:

Well, obviously the things that the Government is funding in this financial year that are big cost items, and which were not anticipated last year - the war against terror and also unauthorised boat arrivals.  It has been necessary for us to fund both of those.  And I think all Australians will agree that making sure that our troops are adequately and properly funded in the field is a first priority of the Government.  We will do that adequately and properly.  What that will mean is, we will have to be tight on expenditure in other areas.  What the Government will have to do is, now that it has the demands of the war against terror as a first priority, it means that it will have to give priority to that, and it will have to be tight in other areas.  And we will be.  Thanks.
