Michael Keenan MP - Federal Member for  Stirling 6PR Interview with Howard Sattler April 22, 2013

Topics: Labor’s border protection failures/ASIO background checks

Howard Sattler

Now joining me is Michael Keenan, he is the Opposition Border Protection spokesmen. He was actually with Tony Abbott  today when he was heckled by refugee advocates saying he can’t use the word illegal. Hello Michael.

Michael Keenan

Good afternoon Howard, how are you?

Howard Sattler

What do you understand about the word illegal when you use it in these terms?

Michael Keenan

It is actually a term that, I noticed that the Minister Brendan O’Connor said that he didn’t use it, but it has been used by  both Julia Gillard, Kevin Rudd and his predecessor  as Immigration Minister so it is a word that has been used by both  sides of politics for a long time. It is entirely correct to use it in these circumstances.

Howard Sattler

What is that referring to Michael?

Michael Keenan

It is the mode of entry. What people say to us, which is fair enough, is that it is not illegal to seek asylum, that is true. But it  certainly is illegal to cross our borders in this way and you can find that same language in the relevant UN Convention.  There is nothing controversial about using it but Howard I must say that this has been raised with me on lots of occasions

and I know it has been raised with my colleagues and in terms of the problem we are dealing with, 38,000 people arriving  here under the Labor Party’s watch, we have had over 500 boats under Prime Minister Julia Gillard and hundreds of  people die on this journey and I must say people quibbling about the terminology I just don’t think is the main game.

Howard Sattler

So what you are saying I think, is the way they are trying to get into Australia is illegal. What they should be doing is  getting in the queue, I know people say there isn’t a queue but there is, if they don’t stand behind each other then there is  a queue of people who have applied in camps all over the world to go to places like Australia. Now to jump ahead of those  people is illegal is that right?

Michael Keenan

It is illegal to cross our borders without permission in this way.  Remember you are paying a criminal to do it and as I have  said we use this terminology, the Government has used it and somewhere along the way somebody raised an issue about  it, I am not sure why. It is perfectly valid within the international framework to which we deal with. As I said to you Howard,  I really think in terms of what is a very significant issue, I think the terminology is really not the most important thing we  should be focusing on.

Howard Sattler

Can I ask you about this Egyptian terrorist, suspected Sri Lankan murderer and the Iranian drug trafficker, all now in  Australia seeking asylum?

Michael Keenan

It is almost impossible to believe that what was reported in the press over the weekend is true.

Howard Sattler

Is it true or not? The Minister seemed to confirm it.

Michael Keenan

I have written to the Minister today asking him to clarify whether it is true and I have listed a series of questions that I think  he needs to respond to. The idea that we would have people of this nature in low security facilities or unbelievably in  community detention I think is quite extraordinary and the Minister needs to explain fully to the Australian people about  what has actually gone on here. He is right to say that it is possible for people of bad character to cross our borders but  the idea that we would then deal with them by releasing them into the community is beyond belief.

Howard Sattler

The Egyptian fellow is on a red notice from Interpol now why wouldn’t he be just put into a high security cell and then  shipped back to where he came from immediately?

Michael Keenan

That is a very good question and that is why we are trying to clarify what has actually happened here. We have got the  media report. I am trying to clarify whether it is true. If the circumstances represented in that report are correct then the  Government really needs to explain how this has been allowed to happen and why it is that people who are clearly of bad  character, not that they cross over here but the way they have been treated. People walk out of low security detention  centres  and if you are a criminal of such serious nature  and you are in these low security facilities, or worse in community detention, then I think the Australian people are allowed to ask why that is the case.

Howard Sattler

Well they are asking. Thanks for your time.

Michael Keenan

Nice to talk to you Howard.
