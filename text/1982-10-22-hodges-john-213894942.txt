THE HON. JOHN HODGES, M.P.

Minister  for I m m i g r a t i o n  an d  Ethnic  Affairs

NATIONAL LANGUAGE POLICY CONFERENCE

Ca n b e r r a , 22 Oc t o b e r , 1982

ONE DOES NOT NEED TO READ ORWELL'S '1984 '  WITH ITS  EMPHASIS ON 'NEWSPEAK1  AS A MEANS OF CONTROLLING PEOPLE'S

THOUGHTS TO APPRECIATE THE IMPORTANCE OF LANGUAGE IN OUR

SOCIETY.

A NATION'S LANGUAGE REFLECTS ITS HISTORY - IT IS IN FACT

ALMOST A SOCIAL INDEX OF WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN THE PAST,

AND WHAT INFLUENCES ARE IN VOGUE DURING THE PRESENT.

THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE IS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THIS. IT  IS A HYBRID OF MANY EUROPEAN INFLUENCES, AND IN FACT

HAS CHANGED OVER TIME.

THE IMPORTANCE OF LANGUAGE IN SHAPING OUR THOUGHTS

AND ATTITUDES MAKES YOUR CONFERENCE TIMELY.

THE VERY HOLDING OF THIS CONFERENCE REFLECTS A

FUNDAMENTAL CHARACTERISTIC OF AUSTRALIA - THE FREEDOM

OF SPEECH AND DEBATE - THE ABILITY TO CANVASS AN  ISSUE SUCH AS. A LANGUAGE POLICY IN AN OPEN WAY.

THE ISSUE OF THE SUPPOSED NEED FOR A NATIONAL LANGUAGE

POLICY WHICH INVOLVES PROVIDING ALL AUSTRALIANS WITH  THE RIGHT TO LEARN A SECOND LANGUAGE HAS BEEN RAISED

IN RECENT TIMES. '

IT IS ARGUED THAT AS A RESULT OF AUSTRALIA'S HEAVY

IMMIGRATION PROGRAMME SINCE WORLD WAR 11, AUSTRALIA'S

SOCIETY HAS CHANGED DRAMATICALLY SINCE 1945.

WE ARE NO LONGER A PURELY ANGLO-SAXON COMMUNITY THAT

SHARES A COMMON BRITISH HERITAGE.

INSTEAD, THERE ARE NOW MANY MIGRANTS WHO COME FROM

NON-ENGLISH SPEAKING COUNTRIES AND WHO HAVE DIFFERENT  CULTURAL BACKGROUND THAN GREAT BRITAIN.

IT IS CLAIMED THAT BECAUSE AUSTRALIA HAS BECOME A .

MULTICULTURAL SOCIETY AND"TO PREVENT INJUSTICES TO

. . /2

- 2 -

PERSONS FROM NON-ENGLISH SPEAKING BACKGROUNDS, A NATIONAL

LANGUAGE POLICY SHOULD BE DEVELOPED SO 1  ALL AUSTRALIANS  BECOME COMPETENT IN ANOTHER LANGUAGE'.

I ASK THIS CONFERENCE TO SERIOUSLY EXAMINE THE UNDERLYING

LOGIC OF THIS APPROACH IN TERMS OF WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN

AUSTRALIA SINCE OUR LARGE IMMIGRATION PROGRAMME BEGAN  DURING THE POST-WAR YEARS.

THE LARGE NUMBER OF MIGRANTS AND THE DIVERSITY OF THEIR

BACKGROUNDS PRESENTED THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT AND THE  AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE WITH AN IMMENSE CHALLENGE. .

WE HAD TO ENSURE THAT SUCH PERSONS COMING TO SUCH A  PREDOMINANTLY ENGLISH-SPEAKING COUNTRY WERE NOT

DEPRIVED OF ACCESS TO.SERVICES AVAILABLE TO OTHER

AUSTRALIANS.

WE HAD TO ENSURE THAT OUR SOCIETY DID NOT DISCRIMINATE

AGAINST THESE PERSONS BECAUSE OF THEIR DIFFERENCES.

WE HAD TO ENSURE THAT SOCIAL HARMONY AND NATIONAL

UNITY WERE MAINTAINED.

FEW OTHER NATIONS HAVE HAD AN INFLUX OF PEOPLE OF

SUCH DIVERSITY AS AUSTRALIA.

AS YOUR CONFERENCE PAPERS STRESS, IT IS IMPORTANT THAT

THE RIGHTS OF AUSTRALIANS FROM NON-ENGLISH SPEAKING BACKGROUNDS

ARE PROPERLY RECOGNISED AND THEIR NEEDS MET.

I BELIEVE WE HAVE DONE THIS TO A LARGE EXTENT.

AUSTRALIA’S RESPONSE TO THIS CHALLENGE OF MIGRATION HAS

BEEN, AND REMAINS, A MODEL FOR THE REST OF THE WORLD.

NUMEROUS PROGRAMMES HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED TO ASSIST NEW

ARRIVALS.

MORE IMPORTANTLY, THE AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE HAVE RESPONDED

WARMLY TO THE PEOPLE COMING TO THESE SHORES.

. ./3

-. V

;

FEW OTHER NATIONS HAVE SUCH RACIAL HARMONY AND NATIONAL

UNITY AS THIS COUNTRY.

AUSTRALIA HAS BECOME A MULTICULTURAL SOCIETY IN A

SPONTANEOUS WAY - NOT BY GOVERNMENT DIRECTION.

INDEED, THE GOVERNMENT'S RECENT STATEMENTS ON

MULTICULTURALISM AREA REFLECTION WHAT HAS LONG BEEN A

CHARACTERISTIC OF THIS COUNTRY _ TOLERANCE AND  ACCEPTANCE OF A DIVERSITY OF BACKGROUNDS AND VIEWS.

THIS HAS BEEN ACHIEVED WITHOUT A NATIONAL LANGUAGE POLICY

AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN EXTENSIVE PROGRAMME OF SECOND

LANGUAGES. .

INSTEAD, WE HAVE LET PEOPLE MAKE THEIR OWN DECISIONS ON THE DEGREE  TO WHICH THEY WISH TO RETAIN THEIR OWN LANGUAGE AND

CULTURES.

MANY HAVE, AS THERE ARE SOME 100 LANGUAGES AND DIALECTS

NOW SPOKEN IN AUSTRALIA.

FURTHERMORE, WITH COMMONWEALTH ASSISTANCE, OVER 100,000

CHILDREN FROM ALL PARTS OF OUR SOCIETY ATTEND SATURDAY.

MORNING LANGUAGE SCHOOLS.

IN ASSESSING THE NEED FOR A NATIONAL LANGUAGE POLICY

MAY I SUGGEST TO THE CONFERENCE THAT RECOGNITION BE  GIVEN TO WHAT HAS ALREADY BEEN ACHIEVED AND THE PRESENT  NATURE OF AUSTRALIAN SOCIETY.

AUSTRALIA REMAINS A PREDOMINANTLY ENGLISH SPEAKING

COMMUNITY.

AS MY COLLEAGUE, THE FORMER MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION,

MR MACPHEE, STATED LAST YEAR: Â·

- 3Â­

.  ./4

- 4-

"ENGLISH IS AND WILL CONTINUE..

TO BE THE LANGUAGE OF AUSTRALIA".

HE CORRECTLY POINTED OUT THAT BECAUSE OF THE VERY DIVERSITY

OF OUR MIGRANTS ,

"ENGLISH IS THE LANGUAGE THROUGH

WHICH PERSONS FROM DIFFERENT  NON-ENGLISH SPEAKING BACKGROUNDS

CAN COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER

AS WELL AS WITH ENGLISH-ONLY SPEAKERSl"

THERE IS NO NEED FOR LEGISLATION TO ENFORCE THE IMPORTANCE

OF ENGLISH IN OUR SOCIETY.

I NOTICE THAT YOUR CONFERENCE PAPERS STATE THAT AUSTRALIA

"WILL ONLY BE TRULY MULTICULTURAL

WHEN EQUAL STATUS IS ACCORDED TO

ALL CULTURES AND LANGUAGES."

AS I HAVE ALREADY STRESSED, AUSTRALIA WILLINGLY ACCEPTS

THE DIVERSITY OF CULTURES NOW IN THIS COUNTRY.

BUT, WHAT IS MEANT BY 'EQUAL STATUS'?

SURELY, YOU CANNOT SERIOUSLY SUGGEST THAT THE NUMEROUS

OTHER LANGUAGES BEING SPOKEN CAN BECOME INTERCHANGABLE  WITH ENGLISH AS THE COMMON MODE OF EXPRESSION.

IN DEVELOPING POLICIES GOVERNMENTS MUST GIVE PRIORITY

TO AREAS OF MOST NEED. THEY DO NOT HAVE UNLIMITED RESOURCES

TO MEET EVERY DEMAND OF EVERY GROUP.

GIVEN THE PREDOMINANCE AND IMPORTANCE OF ENGLISH IN OUR

SOCIETY AND THE NEED TO ENSURE MIGRANTS HAVE EQUAL ACCESS

TO THE WIDER AUSTRALIAN COMMUNITY, THIS GOVERNMENT, AND

PREVIOUS GOVERNMENTS HAVE GIVEN PRIORITY TO HELPING MIGRANTS

GAIN A WORKING KNOWLEDGE OF ENGLISH.

. ./5

- 5-

THIS IS A PRIORITY I STRONGLY SUPPORT.

THE COMMONWEALTH RECOGNISES THIS AND IN 1982-83 PROVIDED

$70.9 M TO GOVERNMENT AND NON-GOVERNMENT SCHOOLS  FOR ENGLISH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE PROGRAMME.

A FURTHER $34.4M IS BEING PROVIDED FOR ADULT MIGRANT  AND REFUGEE EDUCATION.

THE COMMONWEALTH SCHOOLS COMMISSION IN ITS SUBMISSION

TO THE SENATE STANDING COMMITTEE ON EDUCATION AND THE

ARTS INQUIRY INTO A NATIONAL LANGUAGE POLICY STRESSED

THAT PRIMARY FOCUS SHOULD BE GIVEN TO ENGLISH TEACHING.  IT SAID:

"THE TEACHING.OF ENGLISH, AS A FIRST

MAJOR ELEMENT IN A LANGUAGE PROGRAMME

SHOULD HAVE OVERRIDING PRIORITY".

I NOTE ON PAGE 14 OF YOUR PAPERS THAT,

"COMPETENCE IN A SECOND LANGUAGE  SHOULD BE FOR 'ALL AUSTRALIANS'", ,

IS ADVOCATED. .

I MUST ASK IF THIS. CONFERENCE COULD SERIOUSLY CONSIDER

THE IMPLICATIONS OF THAT APPROACH.

FIRSTLY, WHAT WOULD THE COST OF A NATIONAL LANGUAGE

POLICY BE?

HAS THIS BEEN ASSESSED?

I AM AWARE THAT YOU BELIEVE THE TEST OF THE GOVERNMENT'S

COMMITMENT TO THIS PROGRAMME IS THE LEVEL OF FINANCE

IT IS WILLING TO PROVIDE.

. ./6

- 6 - ALMOST $7 BILLION IS SPENT ON EDUCATION B Y Ã¢ÂÂ COMMONWEALTH  AND STATE GOVERNMENTS - 15.5 PER CENT OF ALL PUBLIC  EXPENDITURE. NOW, I ASK YOU, GIVEN THE MANY COMPETING DEMANDS ON  THE GOVERNMENT FOR FUNDS FOR DIFFERENT PROJECTS CAN  WE FINANCE WHAT IS ENVISAGED IN YOUR PROPOSALS? ARE WE TO EXPAND PUBLIC EXPENDITURE FURTHER AND INCREASE  TAXES? Ã¢ÂÂ  I KNOW THE OTHER ALTERNATIVE IS TO REALLOCATE RESOURCES  FROM SOME LESS 'WORTHY'  AREAS - BUT IS THAT REALISTIC? I WOULD SAY IT WAS NOT. NO - THE ANSWER IS THAT WE MUST PROVIDE SUPPORT TO  AREAS OF MAXIMUM NEED, AND GIVEN OUR SOCIETY, I BELIEVE  THAT WE SHOULD BE HELPING MIGRANTS LEARN ENGLISH AS  SOON AS POSSIBLE. MANY OF YOU MAY DISAGREE BUT I BELIEVE THERE ARE OTHER PRIORITIES IN EDUCATION WHICH WE SHOULD BE PURSUING RATHER THAN ENSURING THAT CHILDREN LEARN 'AS OF RIGHT' . A SECOND LANGUAGE. . MY COLLEAGUE,  BARRY JONES, FEDERAL MEMBER FOR LALOR, RECENTLY POINTED OUT THAT 10 PER CENT OF AUSTRALIAN  ADULTS ARE ILLITERATE. IS THAT A PROBLEM WHICH SHOULD HAVE A HIGHER PRIORITY  THAN A^NATIONAL LANGUAGE POLICY? Ã¢ÂÂ¢INDEED, WHY DO WE NOT PURSUE A NATIONAL MUSIC POLICY WHEREBY  EVERY PERSON HAS, 'AS OF RIGHT",  THE ACCESS TO LEARN DIFFERENT  MUSCIAL INSTRUMENTS? MICHAEL MCKELLAR, FORMER MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND ETHNIC  AFFAIRS, WHEN DISCUSSING THE ISSUE OF SECOND LANGUAGES  ACKNOWLEDGED OTHER PROBLEMS IN THIS AREA. n FOR INSTANCE, HE SAID, THE VERY DIVERSITY OF LANGUAGES  OF MIGRANTS WOULD MEAN THAT IT COULD BE DIFFICULT TO  DECIDE WHICH ONES OUGHT TO BE PURSUED. - 7- IN OTHER COUNTRIES, SUCH AS THE NETHERLANDS . .  . . . .  , THE ISSUE OF A SECOND LANGUAGE IS MORE SIMPLE - ENGLISH  IS THE SECOND LANGUAGE TAUGHT. IN AUSTRALIA THE ISSUE IS LESS CLEARCUT AND THE NEED  LESS URGENT. INDEED, DURING MY EXTENSIVE RANGE OF VISITS TO ALL PARTS  OF AUSTRALIA, I PERSONALLY HAVE RECEIVED LITTLE PRESSURE  FOR THE NEED TO INTRODUCE AN EXTENSIVE RANGE OF SECOND  LANGUAGES IN OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM. CERTAINLY, I AGREE THAT THERE SHOULD BE A BETTER COÂ­ ORDINATION OF THE EXISTING RANGE OF LANGUAGES BEING  TAUGHT IN AUSTRALIA:. . BUT IN DEVELOPING SUCH AN APPROACH WE MUST NOT LOSE  SIGHT OF THE FACT THAT CONSTITUTIONALLY EDUCATION IS A  STATE GOVERNMENT RESPONSIBILITY AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENTS  NEED TO BE WARY OF USURPING THE ROLE OF THE STATES IN  THIS AREA. .  . WE DO NOT HAVE UNIFIED EDUCATION SYSTEM - IT IS DIVERSE. MANY CEAIM THAT THIS DIVERSITY IS A STRENGTH NOT A WEAKNESS. IN MANY WÂ£YS THE DECLINE IN THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN FORMALLY  STUDYING A SECOND LANGUAGE, IS A REFLECTION OF PEOPLE'S  OWN CHOICES AND THE WIDE RANGE OF SUBJECTS NOW BEING OFFERED.  PERHAPS SOME SUBJECTS SHOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE SO THAT  SECOND LANGUAGES COULD BECOME PART OF THE CURRICULUM? I AM INTERESTED IN HEARING YOUR RESPONSE TO THAT QUESTION. / 8 -  "<Â· -8Â­ IN CONSIDERING THIS WHOLE NATIONAL LANGUAGE SUBJECT  I HAVE ATTEMPTED TO BE AS VISIONARY AS POSSIBLE. LET ME STRESS THAT I APPREICATE THE BENEFITS OF BEING ABLE TO SPEAK A SECOND LANGUAGE OR INDEED BEING MULTILINGUAL. SUCH AN ABILITY HAS CLEAR BENEFITS BOTH TO THE INDIVIDUAL  AND COMMUNITY. BUT I BELIEVE WE MUST VIEW THIS WHOLE QUESTION IN THE  CONTEXT OF AUSTRALIA'S HISTORY, OUR PRESENT SOCIAL  STRUCTURE, THE AVAILABILITY OF RESOURCES, AND OUR SUCCESS  IN RESPONDING TO THE CHALLENGES OF OUR POST-WAR IMMIGRATION  PROGRAMMES. YES, IN RELATION TO MIGRANT MATTERS, THERE HAVE BEEN  SOME PROBLEMS - BUT LET US BE FRANK - THEY HAVE NOT BEEN  DRAMATIC. .’ AS I SAID BEFORE, AUSTRALIA'S RESPONSE TO THE MANY  CHALLENGES OF THE VAST INFLUX OF PEOPLE INTO THIS  COUNTRY HAS BEEN, AND REMAINS A MODEL FOR THE REST OF  THE WORLD. BEFORE WE EMBARK ON ANY OF THE NUMEROUS PLANKS SUGGESTED BY A NATIONAL LANGUAGE POLICY I WILL HAVE TO BE CONVINCED -THAT THE COSTS, AND THE DOWNGRADING OF OTHER PRIORITIES, WILL PRODUCE BENEFITS WHICH AUSTRALIA IS GOING TO ENJOY  IN TWENTY YEARS TIME, OR AT SOME TIME IN THE FUTURE. THE ROLE OF GOVERNMENTS IS TO MEET THE NEEDS FOR THE  WHOLE OF SOCIETY, TO GIVE PRIORITIES WHERE. MAXIMUM  BENEFIT WILL OCCUR. '  '  Â· THIS OFTEN MEANS RESISTING THE CRASHING WAVES OF PARTICULAR GROUPS. IT IS MY RESOLVE, THAT GIVEN OUR LIMITED RESOURCES OUR  ATTENTION SHOULD FOCUS IN HELPING THOSE. MOST IN NEED. IN MY OPINION, IT IS THE NEW ARRIVALS TO AUSTRALIA WHO NEED A WORKING KNOWLEDGE OF ENGLISH AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. 9 I AM PROUD OF AUSTRALIA'S IMMIGRATION RECORD, AND THERE  IS NO DOUBT THAT OUR SOCIETY HAS BEEN ENRICHED AND BECOME  MORE OPEN. THAT HAS BEEN ACHIEVED BY PUTTING OUR PRIORITIES IN  THE RIGHT ORDER. I HOPE THAT WILL CONTINUE. IN DISCUSSING A NATIONAL LANGUAGE POLICY WE MUST BE SURE  THAT WE DO NOT IMPOSE ON THE MASS OF AUSTRALIANS AND  EXPENSIVE PROGRAMME BEFORE WE ASCERTAIN WHETHER. IT IS WANTED OR  NECESSARY. I HOPE MY VIEWS ARE NOT SEEN IN A PURELY NEGATIVE LIGHT.  AS I SAID BEFORE, I DO APPRECIATE THE VALUE OF PEOPLE  BEING ABLE TO SPEAK A SECOND LANGUAGE. BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT A NUMBER OF ISSUES I HAVE  RAISED TONIGHT MUST BE CONSIDERED AND RESPONDED TO BY  THIS CONFERENCE IF IT IS TO APPROACH THIS VERY COMPLEX  SUBJECT IN A REALISTIC WAY. I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING YOUR RESPONSE.
