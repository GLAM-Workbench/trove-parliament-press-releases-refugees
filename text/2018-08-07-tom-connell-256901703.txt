Tom Connell:

Joining me live now on the program is Liberal Senator James Paterson, for his thoughts.  Senator thanks for your time.

Where do you sit on this? Does it need to get through party room?

Senator James Paterson:

Tom, I’m really loath to become a commentator on the internal Liberal and National Party  policy processes, but I guess the cat is really out of the bag on this one. And it’s been well  canvassed in the media for several months now. So, look there’s not really much of a gap  between what Tony Pasin said this morning and what the Prime Minister and Josh  Frydenberg have said. What happened here, Tom, is that a few months ago Josh  Frydenberg gave a presentation to the Coalition party room on energy policy and on the  NEG, and what he got from the party room was in principle support for the NEG and - as  Tony said this morning - authorisation to go and develop the final details of the package.  Now, like any policy of the federal government it ultimately does have to come back to the  party room because it has to come back in the form of legislation, which we have not seen  yet. And the party room has to give approval to every piece of legislation that’s introduced to  the Parliament. So that is the final stage, and that has not yet happened.

Connell:

Right, so from the point of view of the premiers saying “Hey, we won’t agree to this until we  see the final details”, do you understand their position as well?

Paterson:

If you were drawing up a list of people to consult on energy policy Daniel Andrews would  literally be the last person in Australia you’d go and speak to about energy policy. This is the  Premier who presided over the closure - the premature, early closure - of the Hazelwood  power station in Victoria shutting, off twenty-five per cent of Victoria’s electricity supply,

which has resulted in a doubling of wholesale electricity prices. So frankly, we have to  consult Daniel Andrews because that’s the process of COAG, but really his opinion is not  worth the paper it’s written on.

Connell:

Where do you sit on this? At this stage we’ve got quite a bit of information on the table, are  you supportive of the policy from what we know about it?

Paterson:

Like all my colleagues I’ve agreed in principle to the NEG, and like all my colleagues I’m  looking forward to seeing that final detail in terms of the legislation. Because in this policy  area - as fiendishly complex as it is - the devil is in the detail, and it’s very important and  very appropriate that we give it that scrutiny that it needs. Frankly, I think that in this policy  area more than any other over the last decade most of the policies that have been  introduced have not received the kind of rigour and scrutiny that they deserve, have not  received the kind of input that it should have from the full spectrum of the government’s party  room - so this one really needs to do that. I mean, I’m thinking back, for example Tom, to  the introduction of the renewable energy target in the final days of the Howard Government.  If anyone in that party room had known the full implications of what would happen with a  renewable energy target there is no way on this Earth that they would have agreed to it, and  yet they did. So I think that just highlights how careful we need to be in this place.

Connell:

Right, but what we’ve known since, what we’ve found out since you gave - as one of the  party room members - in principle agreement, you haven’t seen anything that would be a  deal breaker since then; in terms of details about the NEG, the modelling, what the ACCC  has done, what AEMO has done?

Paterson:

It’s very easy, Tom, to envisage a good NEG, a well-designed NEG, that I and my  colleagues would be very happy to support, and it’s also easy to envisage a bad NEG that  we would not support. So we have to see the final detail before we give our final support. But  I have to say Josh Frydenberg is a colleague I have a lot of confidence in, I don’t envy his  task having to shepherd this through COAG, and I certainly don’t want to see a bad deal  come out of COAG. I mean my view is that no deal out of COAG would be better than a bad  deal out of COAG, but I’m sure that Josh Frydenberg won’t be agreeing to a bad deal out of  COAG.

Connell:

What’s a bad NEG though, in your opinion?

Paterson:

Well I don’t want to get too much into the weeds here, Tom, it will put your listeners to sleep,  even at this time in the morning…

Connell:

But this is not so much weed. Do you have a key principle about that? You’ve already  formed a view, as you said, about what could be a bad NEG or a good NEG, can you give  any example of what a bad NEG would contain?

Paterson:

I’ll just say in general terms, Tom, that the kind of NEG that I imagine Daniel Andrews would  like to implement is not one that me and my colleagues would like to implement. He’s  already said that he’d like to be able to very quickly and very easily scale up the emissions  reduction target. I don’t want to make it easier for him or for his friends in any possible future  Labor government to do that. I don’t want, for example, the Victorian state government to be  able to double or triple their emissions reduction target and for an increased burden to fall on  other states as part of that. We don’t want states holding the rest of the country to ransom; if  Victoria is crazy enough to elect a government that wants to have higher emissions targets  well that’s a matter for them, but that should take away from the task of other state  governments, not add to it.

Connell:

Alright, there’s some markers put down. When you say “easily scale up emissions reductions  targets”, if it stays, obviously as it is now, in the federal Parliament that would be the marker  for you, that it has to be an act of Federal Parliament to change the emissions target?

Paterson:

It would just seem logical, Tom. We have agreed to Paris emissions reduction targets of 26  to 28 per cent. That is the Australian government position, that is the position of the  parliament. I don’t see why it should be any greater than that. And if any future government  wants to change that well then they should have to earn a mandate from the people in order  to do that, and they should have to demonstrate that they have that mandate of getting it  through the parliament.

Connell:

So I guess they’re two different things though, aren’t they? Does Labor earn the mandate if  they go to this election saying we want 45 per cent and they win the election?

Paterson:

We can only judge them by the standard they’ve set as an opposition in this parliament and  the previous one, and the way in which they’ve respected the mandate that this government  has clearly earnt for many signature policies - company tax cuts probably being the most  prominent of that. We can’t force them to vote for our policies in the senate, as much as we’d  like to, and they certainly won’t be able to force a possible future Liberal and National  opposition to vote for their policies. So they have to earn enough support in the community  to be able to get it through both houses of parliament. That’s the way our system works.

Connell:

Alright, that’s an interesting bar, I suppose, to set for the future of both major parties, but it  might have been set in the past few years anyway, James Paterson.

Just on immigration and the debate playing out today, Alan Tudge is resisting calls for any  sort of enquiry. Where do you sit on that? The numbers? The impact on society at the  moment?

Paterson:

Tom, we have senate and parliamentary inquiries into much less substantial things than our  population or our immigration; there are dozens of senate inquires going on at any one time  - all of them worthy in their own way, but probably some of which attract less interest and  attention from the Australian people than this would. I don’t have any in principle opposition  to another inquiry that looks at these issues. But I have to say I’ve got confidence in Minsters  like Peter Dutton, like Alan Tudge, and Angus Taylor in this portfolio, and the way that  they’ve managed this issue. And I’m particularly excited by the announcement that Alan  Tudge has made that the government is looking at instituting a proper values test for future  migrants to Australia, because I think more important than anything, even more important  than the numbers, is ensuring that the migrants that do come to Australia have been  carefully selected on the basis that they share and want to uphold Australian values, not that  they are hostile to them.

Connell:

Just finally, on that and some of the talk about immigration, and different communities in  Australia, do you think there’s anything different about the recent waves to Australia? It  seems to me that forever in Australia we’ve had people come here, they take a little time to  get used to the country and, I suppose, assimilate and spread out into the community?

Paterson:

Well Tom, there’s actually some really positive stories on recent waves of immigration that  you don’t hear a lot about. So the extra special intake of Syrian refugees that we took in  relation to the Syrian crisis a couple of years ago, the early evidence shows really positive  results; really high rates of integration, really high rates of engagement in education and the  workplace, very high rates of take up on English language classes and learning. And many  of them have moved to regional areas, some of them have been sponsored by local  churches and are very connected with their community. So there are some really positive  stories from recent migrant intakes, as well as, obviously, some negative ones that we’ve  been reading about as well.

Connell:

There have been a few stories on the positive ones as well, and really boosting community  towns, so yeah, good to talk about that. James Paterson, thanks for your time today.

Paterson:

Thanks, Tom.
