TIMOR

.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs,  Mr Andrew . .  .

Peacock, commented further today o n .the mission of the United,  Nations special representative to East Timor.  .

Mr Peacock said that the Government' believed that .   it was highly desirable that Mr Winspeare-Guicciardi should  be able to-establish contact,with the FRETILIN leaders. .

'  ‘  Â· * ' Ã¢ÂÂ  < Â·  -  '  ’

;  The Government could not accept, however, that

the only, or even the best,  charinel for this would, be an illegal transmitter in Darwin. The special representative had a number ofÂ· . ’  channels open to him, one of which

would be to operate through the administering power, Portugal,

.  Ã¢ÂÂ  Ã¢ÂÂ   Portugal has two corvettes, each with radio

transmitters,  in the area, with one of the corvettes currently  in the port in Darwin. .  . . .

. ”  .  Mr Peacock also noted in this regard that the Ã¢ÂÂ

resolution adopted by the Security Council on 22 December  .1975 specifically called upon Portugal, as .  the:  administering  Ã¢ÂÂ¢power, to cooperate fully with the United Nations to achieve  its objectives in East Timor. .  /

.  Mr Peacock said that the proposal he made yesterday  concerning use of the Portuguese corvettes had now been  conveyed by the Australian Ambassador in New York to the Â·   Secretary-General of .the United Nations.  His understanding  was that Dr Waldheim w a s .now contacting the Portuguese

Government to seek their-agreement to the use of the corvettes.

.  Meanwhile Mr Peacock early today instructed the.

Australian Ambassador in Jakarta to again see. Mr Winspeare-  Guicciardi.  ,  .  .

According to our Ambassador, Mr Winspeare-Guicciardi  had denied reports that he had suggested that his mission had  been frustrated by the action in Darwin taken over the weekend .   to confiscate the illegal radio transmitter. .  The United Nations

special representative agreed that the best means of proceeding  would be to try to establish contact with the FRETILIN forces  through the. use .of the Portuguese facilities. He did not seek  phe re-opening of the Darwin transmitter.
