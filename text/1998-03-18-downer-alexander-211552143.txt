BURMA: 
ATTACKS ON THAI BORDER REFUGEE CAMPS

Â

The Australian Government condemns recent attacks 
by a Burmese Government-sponsored Karen splinter group on two refugee 
camps on the Thai-Burma border.

Â

According to reports, on 11 March the Democratic 
Karen Buddhist Army (DKBA) attacked Wangka Camp killing four people 
and destroying 80% of facilities housing the camp's 9,000 occupants. 
A second attack by the DKBA on 15 March reportedly resulted in more 
deaths at Mae La Camp, which houses 30,000 refugees.

Â

The State Peace and Development Council (SPDC) must 
prevent such attacks on civilian refugee populations in Thailand. I 
have instructed our Embassy in Rangoon to make this point directly to 
the SPDC. On my instruction, our Embassy in Bangkok has also held discussions 
with the Thai Government on the need to ensure security of the camps.

Â

The Australian Government has a longstanding commitment 
to providing material assistance to Burmese refugees in Thai camps who 
have fled the fighting in Burma. In 1997/98 we are providing A$1 million 
to assist these people.
