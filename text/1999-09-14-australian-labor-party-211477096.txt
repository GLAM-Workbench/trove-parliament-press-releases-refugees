EAST TIMOR: INDONESIAN MILITARY MUST GO, REFUGEES 
MUST BE PROTECTED

Â

The Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs, Laurie Brereton, today reaffirmed 
Labor’s cal l for the immediate withdrawal of the Indonesian 
military and militias and warned that urgent action is required to protect 
the East Timorese forcibly removed to West Timor.

Â

“The news today that UNAMET has evacuated its Dili 
compound underlines the fact that absolutely no reliance can be placed 
on the Indonesian military and police to maintain security”, Mr Brereton 
said.

Â

“UNAMET’s departure means that the shutters have 
descended on East Timor until UN peacekeepers arrive - and still the 
Australian Defence Force sits on the docks of Darwin.”

Â

“Every days delay means further atrocities - not 
only in East Timor, but also among the many thousands of East Timorese 
forcibly removed to West Timor by the TNI and militias.”

Â

“The international community must insist that the 
militias are disbanded forthwith and that the Indonesian military leave 
East Timor as soon as possible.”

Â

“The Indonesian military have demonstrated beyond 
doubt that they cannot be trusted. It is foolhardy in the extreme to 
rely on them to play a constructive role alongside peacekeepers.”

Â

“The continued presence of the TNI risks further 
violence including threats to UN peacekeepers and attempts by the militia 
to retain control of the western districts of East Timor.”

Â

“The fate of thousands of East Timorese deported 
to West Timor is a matter of further grave concern.”

Â

“The United Nations High Commission for Refugees must be given immediate 
and unconditional access to East Timorese removed to West Timor and 
allowed to organise their return to Ea st Timor under the protection 
of UN peacekeepers.”
