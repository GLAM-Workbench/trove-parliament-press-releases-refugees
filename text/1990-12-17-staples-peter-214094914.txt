Emergency relief agencies which will administer the funds  under the Emergency Relief Program were announced today by  the Federal Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services,  Peter Staples. Sixteen organisations have been approved for funding for the  first time while a further 271 organisations will receive  renewed funding. "The Federal Government is committed to providing emergency  financial help to people in crisis. We will focus on those in  the community who are most needy, such as low income families  and single parents," Mr Staples said. He emphasised that as well as helping these groups, the  selection of emergency relief agencies is designed to assist  those who are specially disadvantaged such as Aboriginal  people and people from non-English speaking backgrounds. Under the Emergency Relief Program, grants are made to  community and welfare organisations to provide financial  assistance to individuals and families in times of financial  crisis. Assistance is usually in the form of cash or vouchers for  urgent needs such as food, electricity, gas or rental bills. Approval of grants is based on the advice of the NSW  Emergency Relief State Advisory Committee. The committee  considers such matters as regional needs and the suitability  of agencies for handling emergency relief funds in making  recommendations to the Minister. During 1990/91 the Federal Government is providing $7.648m to  welfare agencies throughout Australia for emergency relief  payments. A list of approved grants is attached.
