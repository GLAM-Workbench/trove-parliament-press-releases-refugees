ELECTORATE TALK .  '

The legislation for a National Crimes Commission which was . introduced into Parliament last week will establish ahÂ·  effective agency designed specifically to combat organised crime  and corruption in Australia. At the same time, the legislation .   provides a basis for effective co-operation with the states, ,

and with police forces and other law enforcement agenciesÃ¢ÂÂ .

It has become clear in recent years that organised crime, and  criminal activities relating to drugs and other matters, have  g o t .beyond the reach of our traditional law enforcement methods  and agencies. The Williams and Stewart Royal Commissions ..on  Drugs and Drug Trafficking, a number of joint Commonwealth-state .   police task force reports, and most recently the Costigan  Royal Commission's Interim Report, all tell.vastly disturbing .

stories about the spread and significance of organised crime  in Australia. Mr Costigan's investigations into the Painters  and Dockers Union have highlighted that Australia is not immune  from.the kind of criminal activities which most of us would have .   associated perhaps with Chicago or other countries, but not .   Australia. .  . . .  .

Some quotations from the Costigan Report starkly illustrate .  . the seriousness of the situation. Mr Costigan says, "I am .

satisfied that the Union, at least in Victoria, Newcastle, .   Queensland and South Australia if not i n .Sydney as well, is .  . an organised criminal group following criminal pursuits., At .   least in Victoria those in charge of .the Union recruit  exclusively those who have serious criminal convictions." .  .

(Para.10.02 of Mr Costigan's edited -  Chapter 10 of ;Vol. 2, : 4th Interim Report.) Mr Costigan also says in relation to the kind  of '  activity he has unearthed, "The type of criminal activity '  " is of a. substantial kind. It involves large scale and continuing

fraud, or large and continuous importation of drugs at great  cost, continuing illegal gambling schemes or other forms of  widespread criminal activity.". (Para. 10.09) .  ...

It is imperative to attack these problems urgently and  effectively, to prevent any further entrenchment of this kind  of crime in Australia, and do everything possible to eradicate it.  That is why. the Government is pressing ahead with legislation at

this time.' It is not good e n o u g h t o go on as w e .  have been

doing in spite of everything we know and in spite of all the talk

about the need to act. The. Crimes Commission will co-operate ,   with traditional law enforcement agencies. It will in no  sense replace them and its activities will be essentially  directed towards types of crime which those agencies have

experienced special difficulties.in investigating.

I very much hope the states will keep an open rnind and adopt '

a co-operative stand in relation to the Commission.because  the problems clearly straddle state boundaries, they affect  both Commonwealth and state legal jurisdictions. The Crimes .   Commission will be operating in the areas of Commonwealth law,it  in no way infringes on state sovereignty or state rights. .  . But at the. same time, if any or all of the. states, want to make Â·   use of the Commission, then the Commission will be

empowered by our legislation to accept particular commissions  from the states, and to accept jurisdiction for areas of state  law which states may wish to confer on the Commission. This is  entirely up to the states to determine, but the way is open, .

and there is every reason why the Commonwealth/state co-operation  which has existed with Royal Commissions, joint task forces,  and the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence, should run  into the new Crimes Commission.

The Crimes Commission will be far more appropriate than Royal,Â· .   Commissions to deal with organised crime. Mr Costigan  has emphasised the importance of a prosecuting arm t o 1  attend. . to prosecutions immediately they arise during investigations .

such as his. The Crimes Commission, while able to give  information to the police, will also have its Own responsibility  to. develop cases for prosecution. In serious and complex  cases especially, it is intended that the Commission will work  hand in hand with the legal counsel who will prosecute if a

case for prosecution is found.

To make sure the Commission can deal with whatever forms of  organised crime it uncovers, the Commission will have a broad  charter, giving it scope to look into complaints or follow up its  own investigations, and it will have the powers needed to come

to grips with organised crime. The legislation has been framed  in a way that will make the Commission effective, while also  meeting the legitimate Â«  concerns which have been expressed Â· about the idea of a National Crimes Commission. .

I .  am confident that the Crimes Commission will make a major ?Â·Â·Â·Â·. ; ' .  : .   contribution in dealing with organised crime. It is a vital .   GovernmentÂ· initiative and I. am confident it will receive the  widespread support it deserves. .  '
