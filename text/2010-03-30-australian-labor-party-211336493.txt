Interview with Fran Kelly, Radio National News Breakfast Topics: Stern Hu, border protection, elections in Burma

Transcript, proof E&OE

30 March 2010

FRAN KELLY: Let's return now to the Stern Hu verdict and we are joined in our Parliament House studio by the

Foreign Minister, Stephen Smith.

Stephen Smith, welcome to Breakfast.

STEPHEN SMITH: Thank you Fran, good morning.

FRAN KELLY: Minister, from the information you've received from your consular officials, are you convinced beyond

doubt that Stern Hu and the three other Rio executives took bribes and stole commercial secrets?

STEPHEN SMITH: The advice I have from my officials who attended that part of the trial is that on its face there was

more than sufficient evidence for people to come to a conclusion that acts of bribery had occurred. And that was not

just admissions by Stern Hu and the other three Rio Tinto employees, but also other evidence.

So I'm proceeding on the basis that on the balance of probabilities — or indeed, as Rio itself has said, beyond

reasonable doubt — that acts of bribery occurred and we've seen the response both from the court and also from Rio

itself.

So my own conclusion is that there was more than sufficient evidence so far as bribery and acts of bribery was

concerned.

FRAN KELLY: Okay, the Rio four were also found guilty of stealing commercial secrets. We don't know yet what those

secrets were. You have been critical of China for closing that part of the proceedings. Will you be asking China to

release the evidence?

STEPHEN SMITH: There's a 71-page judgement that the court itself has delivered. That needs to be firstly translated

and then carefully studied. So that will obviously, I think, provide some assistance, not just to the Australian

Government but also to Rio and hopefully to the international business community.

But that doesn't get over the fundamental deficiency that I have referred to.

My analysis yesterday remains the same today which was on the one hand, on the bribery charge, I thought the

sentence was harsh, but on the other hand the lack of transparency on commercial secrets does make life difficult for

the Government in terms of analysis, but also for the international business community in trying to bring some clarity to

what precisely we are talking about here — whether we are talking about the normally available commercial

information in the marketplace or something more broad and deeper than that.

FRAN KELLY: So you are saying Australian companies should be worried now about doing business in China?

STEPHEN SMITH: We've made the point to the Chinese authorities, both before and I repeated yesterday, that this

was very much a lost opportunity, that there was a chance here for China as it emerges into the international economy,

as its international engagement enhances, to provide some clarity about these points.

This matter originated, as everyone knows, in the context of iron ore negotiations and the suggestions in the very early

stages that somehow not just commercial secrets had been infringed, and to use the Chinese parlance, but that state

secrets had been infringed.

We made the point very early in the piece that it may well have been the case that what was being spoken about was

readily or freely available information on the public record or information which was commercially available and as a

consequence that needed to be clarified.

The trial was an opportunity to assist in that process. That opportunity wasn't taken and also it does make it difficult to

provide an analysis or make an analysis so far as Stern Hu and the other three are concerned because obviously they

have been the subject of convictions in that respect, but not in a way in which Australian officials have had any site of.

FRAN KELLY: Minister, critics, including the Opposition again this morning, say the Federal Government should have

protested louder about the exclusion of the Australian media and consular officials from that closed part of the trial

because it's in direct breach of the Consular Agreement we have with China.

Why didn't you protest more loudly and are you worried about China just ripping up, tearing up that Consular

Agreement when it suits them?

STEPHEN SMITH: Three points. Firstly our officials raised the matter both in Beijing, Canberra and Shanghai in terms

of openness of the trial.

When it was indicated by Chinese authorities to our officials that the second part or the commercial secrets part would

be closed, we made multiple representations, again in those three locations, asking for it to be reconsidered.

I called in the Chinese Ambassador to Australia and made the point to him myself that this would not be a helpful

contribution. That yes, we understood that under Chinese law there is a provision which enables a court to be closed if

one party requests that confidential or commercial confidential matters might be at risk.

I indicated that Australian officials, buttressed and backed up by me and the Government, would give the necessary

undertakings, but the transparency was important. So I made those points.

In the end the Chinese authorities, including and in particular the Chinese Shanghai Court said, and decided, that the

court would be closed.

Now closing a court is a provision open to Australian courts in exceptional circumstances. The difficulty with the

Consular Agreement, which of course was signed up by our predecessors and has been in place since 1999/2000, is

that the Consular Agreement expressly says that it is subject both to Chinese law and to Australian law.

And the view of the Shanghai Court and the view of Chinese authorities was that a decision was made consistent with

Chinese law to render that part of the trial closed.

The very strong view I put to the Chinese authorities was that it was wrong, it was a mistake and it wouldn't allow the

appropriate transparency.

So far as the general matter of representations is concerned, from the first moment the Australian Government acting

in Stern Hu's interest has made multiple representations at every level, including from the Prime Minister to the

Chinese Premier and the Chinese President, including from myself to my counterpart, Foreign Minister Yang.

So it gets down to whether you believe as the opposition does that when it comes to China, megaphone diplomacy

from our opposition is the appropriate course of conduct or whether quiet diplomacy and making these points firmly at

the appropriate time with the appropriate levels is the way to go.

Now people can make their own judgements about that, but I've seen plenty of Chinese commentators say that the

approach we adopted is the only sensible course of action to pursue.

FRAN KELLY: Okay, let's go to what happens now. You said you expect the bilateral relationship to be preserved, but

if we look at the industrial espionage charges, if those charges are true, these crimes were committed by senior

employees of one of Australia's largest companies.

Does this raise questions about the company's activities in China and should ASIC, our corporate regulator, be

investigating the activities of Rio Tinto in China now?

STEPHEN SMITH: Firstly, let me make a couple of points about the bilateral relationship. We went through some tense

and difficult times last year, but we worked our way through that. We came, I think, to a much better understanding that

there will be issues in respect to which Australia and China will disagree about.

We have different systems, including different systems of law. On a range of things we have different values. So from

time to time there will be issues in respect of which we simply have to agree to disagree.

So the tensions we had last year in my view will help us manage the relationship. You have to take a long term patient

view of China.

So I don't believe what occurred yesterday will in any way impact adversely on the bilateral relationship.

Secondly, so far as the commercial secrets or to use the phrase you have, industrial espionage, again the difficulty of

providing an analysis here is the lack of transparency.

As I said earlier, it may be that some light is shed on it by the 71-page judgement. In so far as Rio's operations are

concerned, Rio has, as has the Government, made it clear that wherever bribery occurs, whether it's in Australia,

whether it's in China, wherever it is, we don't condone it. On the contrary we condemn it.

So Rio has made its position clear. Now you have to ask ASIC whether anything has emerged in the course of these

matters which would attract ASIC's interest. That's entirely a matter for the independent regulator and also in general

terms what Rio does is entirely a matter for Rio.

FRAN KELLY: Okay, so the Government won't be making any representation to ASIC, any referral?

STEPHEN SMITH: Well, I've seen nothing come across my desk which would cause me to contemplate such a matter

in any event. ASIC is an independent regulator. It can take these steps of the same volition if it so chooses.

FRAN KELLY: Stephen Smith, the border protection debate is off and running again. Australia has received now 100

boats in total since the Rudd Government took office.

It seems as though the Rudd Government is losing control of this issue and your efforts, certainly of diplomacy in the

region to try and stop the boats coming is failing.

STEPHEN SMITH: I don't agree with the analysis that our efforts on diplomacy in terms of our regional efforts are

failing.

We have been working very hard, not just with Indonesia, but with other countries in the region, whether they are

source or transit countries, including Sri Lanka, including Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, through the Bali process to

deal with this difficulty.

The Minister for Immigration and I have made it clear for the last year or so that we fully expected boats would continue

to come and that is as a result of the very serious disruption and security issues we see, particularly in

Afghanistan and more recently in Sri Lanka. And the recent reports of the United Nation's High Commissioner for

Refugees make that point. We are dealing here with very difficult push factors and that requires … FRAN KELLY:

Doesn't the recent UN Report make the point that in fact the numbers are pretty stable in terms of people going to other

countries except Australia where more are coming over the last few months?

STEPHEN SMITH: Well that's not how I read the Report and that's not my analysis and that's not how the local

UNHCR representative in Australia interpreted the report.

We've got over 40 million displaced people throughout the world. We've got something like 23, 24, 25 million displaced

people in our region. We've seen in 2008/2009 the worst in recent years so far as security is concerned in Afghanistan

and we have the aftermath of a 25 year old conflict in Sri Lanka.

These caused large displacements and what we have tried to do is to enhance our engagement with our regional

partners through the so called Bali Process, in particular with Indonesia. But we've also tried to manage this matter in a

way in which, unlike previous Governments, we don't engage in victimisation of the people who come.

We discharge our international obligations. We have enhanced our border security arrangements and we are dealing

with a very difficult issue which the Minister for Immigration and I and others in the Government have for some time

been saying, that this problem is not going to go away overnight.

FRAN KELLY: And Minister can I get a brief response from you to the news that in Burma the opposition, Aung San

Suu Kyi and the National League for Democracy will now boycott the elections this year. Can any election without the

NLD be legitimate?

STEPHEN SMITH: I don't believe that any election without the National League for Democracy can be a full, free and

fair election.

I flagged this potential difficulty in the last couple of days of the Parliament when the electoral regulations were

published by the Burmese regime.

It effectively made it difficult if not impossible for the National League for Democracy to take part in the election with

Aung San Suu Kyi and so this is a matter which the NLD had to make. It's been a difficult decision for them.

But unless something fundamental or substantial changes, regrettably I think it does put paid to what slim prospects we

had, hopeful prospects we had earlier this year that we might make some progress on the democracy front in Burma.

FRAN KELLY: Okay Stephen Smith, thank you very much for joining us again on Breakfast.

STEPHEN SMITH: Thanks Fran.
