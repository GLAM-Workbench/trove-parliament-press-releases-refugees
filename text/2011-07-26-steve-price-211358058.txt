TRANSCRIPT OF THE HON. TONY ABBOTT MHR,  INTERVIEW WITH STEVE PRICE,  RADIO MTR, MELBOURNE

E&OE……………………….…………………………………………………………………

TONY ABBOTT:

G’day, Steve.

STEVE PRICE:

Another broken promise - we’ve got 567 people on Christmas Island who will now be processed in  Australia. We’ve got 47 people at sea. They’ll be processed here in Australia. I guess they had to do that  because if they hadn’t you would’ve been about five boats away from this deal being completed before it  had even been announced.

TONY ABBOTT:

I think that’s right, but that’s not the only broken promise, Steve. There were also the Prime Minister’s  solemn assurance that boat people would never be sent from Australia to a country that hadn’t signed the  UN convention on Refugees and not only has Malaysia not signed the convention but it has no intention of  signing the convention so this is two broken promises involved in this one deal from a Prime Minister who  is just completely untrustworthy.

STEVE PRICE:

Remarkably, refugee advocates like Marion Le who you’d be aware of in New South Wales, I’ve talked to  her plenty of times, she’s in Malaysia. She believes this deal is inhumane, shouldn’t go ahead and shouldn’t  be done. Did you ever think you would hear somebody who had been so critical of the Howard Government  during those years not supporting a Labor Government’s refugee plan?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, Steve, Marion Le is a person of integrity. I mean, I don’t always agree with her but I think she is very  decent and genuine and committed and Marion Le has had the decency to speak out against this government  and its, I think, ugly deal. There are a lot of other people - including a lot of people inside the Labor Party -  who were absolutely vociferous about the Howard Government and its alleged human rights deficiency and  they have just so far meekly gone along with this. Now, refugees will be exposed to far more brutality in

Malaysia than has ever been the case and would ever have been the case under the Howard Government and  I just wonder how people in the Labor left can live with themselves this morning.

STEVE PRICE:

The Prime Minister has guaranteed that no one will be arrested or caned. She can’t give that guarantee, can  she, once they are released back out into the Malaysian community after a month in Australian care?

TONY ABBOTT:

Absolutely not. She can’t give that guarantee at all. What happens to them will depend entirely upon  Malaysian law and the Malaysian authorities and this idea that the Prime Minister can guarantee what  happens to people who are potentially long term residents in another country is nonsense. She’s trying to  give a fig leaf of human rights respectability to something which is completely dodgy.

STEVE PRICE:

And this cooked up deal has also created a two tier refugee system in Malaysia. You’ve got, I think, upwards  of 95,000 people waiting there to be processed to go somewhere or into the Malaysian community. Now we  are going to have this strange 800 group who end up back there with better conditions, Australian taxpayers’  money subsidising them for a month. Yeah they go to the end of a queue but they are treated completely  differently to the 95,000 who are already there.

TONY ABBOTT:

Which has got to cause further problems in Malaysia and, again, it just highlights the completely anomalous  nature of this deal. One of the other features is that there has apparently been no endorsement whatsoever of  this by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees and you might remember Steve that one of the points that  left wing members of the caucus were making a few years a go was that if it didn’t get UNHCR backing,  they couldn’t support it. So, this is another issue where there is going to be a problem inside the Labor  caucus - either a problem of discipline for the Prime Minister or I guess a complete capitulation of  conscience from the Labor left.

STEVE PRICE:

There can’t be people on the left in caucus who could possibly be happy that this is happening. I mean, are  we not going to be asking the Australian Federal Police or indeed the military to force men, women and  children - and the Prime Minister said yesterday that not even pregnant women would be absolved from this  exchange - up the stairs of aircraft?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I must say, Steve, this is one of the things that has puzzled me a little. I mean, how can you force  people onto an aircraft if they don’t want to go? Now look, I know the AFP and the Australian military are  very capable and I know at the end of the day, they will carry out the orders of the Government but it’s  going to be ugly, I suspect. It is going to be very, very ugly indeed and I wouldn’t want to be those officers  called upon to undertake that task.

STEVE PRICE:

What if they don’t want to get off at the other end?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, again, I suppose there could be further ugly scenes and, I imagine - and  this isn’t my deal so I’m  probably not the best person to explain it - but I imagine at the other end if they didn’t want to get off, it will  be up to the Malaysian security forces to disembark them and that could be pretty harrowing too. So, all up,  I think this is a very, very unfortunate deal and as I said, all of the people who got on their moral high horse  when the Howard Government started sending boat people to Nauru, I think ought to be ashamed of their  silence, if indeed silence is what we get from them.

STEVE PRICE:

Would you stop this deal if you were to be elected?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, it wouldn’t be necessary because we’ve got an alternative and that’s Nauru. Now, I don’t pretend that  every aspect of the Howard Government’s border protection programme was something that people  universally felt comfortable with. It was a tough policy. It had to be a tough policy to deter people and to put  the people smugglers out of business but it did work and it was vastly more humane than what this  government has in mind because everyone sent to Nauru was treated in accordance with Australian  standards and the people sent to Malaysia will be treated in accordance with Malaysian standards. Now, I’m  not anti-Malaysian, I’m pro-Malaysian, but their standards are very, very different to ours and I think that  once people get to Australia we have an obligation to them and that obligation is to treat them in accordance  with what we think are proper standards, not in accordance with what other countries think are proper  standards and, plainly, people who are irregular arrivals in Malaysia are treated very differently and much  more harshly than would ever be acceptable in Australia.

STEVE PRICE:

Fifteen past seven, 131 873 if you have a view on this refugee deal. On the carbon tax, before I let you go,  the Financial Review reported yesterday that before she took over as Prime Minister, Julia Gillard had urged  her party to come together with you and come up with a bipartisan solution. She’s since denied that. What  do you make of that suggestion?

TONY ABBOTT:

I can’t imagine that a senior journalist like Geoff Kitney would have written that without absolutely  indubitable evidence for it and I guess I would be encouraging responsible members of the media to go to  Kevin Rudd and Lindsay Tanner and ask them what they can remember because plainly this memo was for  the inner Cabinet, it was for Julia Gillard herself, Wayne Swan, Lindsay Tanner and Kevin Rudd and I think  they should be questioned as to exactly what they can remember because if this memo is correct, and as I  said, I can’t imagine that the Fin would publish a story that it wasn’t completely confident about…

STEVE PRICE:

Well they had a lot of detail. They said there was a one and a half page Gillard paper arguing that as long as  you were Leader of the Opposition there was no prospect of the Coalition shifting back to the climate  change policies of Malcolm Turnbull. I mean, how could you get that so wrong that a one and a half page  memo with a title, The Bipartisan Solution exists?

TONY ABBOTT:

And stating that the author was confident that direct action measures of the kind proposed by the Coalition  could achieve a five per cent emissions reduction target by 2020. Look, what I think is that Julia Gillard has  been caught out yet again, Steve. The real Julia was expressing herself in that memo. Since then we’ve had  two subsequent policies. We’ve had the people’s convention policy that was announced during the election

and the never-ever carbon tax policy that was announced six days before the election and then of course  we’ve had the carbon tax policy announced since the election and I think what that shows is that the  Government’s current policy is not real Julia, it’s Green Julia and it’s in fact the real Bob Brown that we’re  getting from this government and this is yet another reason, Steve, why the caucus is so unhappy, because  they know that the climate change policy that’s been foisted upon them by the Prime Minister is a policy  designed by the Greens, not a policy designed by the caucus.

STEVE PRICE:

Did we hit the bike with renewed vigour yesterday and again today in tribute to Cadel Evans’ win in the  Tour de France?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, Steve, yesterday I ran up Castle Hill with some of RAAFies from Townsville and so I wasn’t on the  bike and today I’ve done that which I did on the first day of the election campaign. I’ve got up and I’ve  started talking to the media without getting my dose of exercise, Steve.

STEVE PRICE:

What? That’s no good.

TONY ABBOTT:

That’s no good, but I’m hoping to have a little bit of time this afternoon to get the run in.

STEVE PRICE:

It was a great effort from Cadel, wasn’t it?

TONY ABBOTT:

Oh, extraordinary. Absolutely extraordinary. Look, you know, we have a lot of very tough sportspeople in  this country. Some of our footballers are extraordinarily tough. Danny Green, you don’t contest a world  boxing title without being very tough, Craig Alexander who’s won two Hawaii Ironmans, what an amazing  sportsman Craig is. But to win a Tour de France, I mean, I think it would be the toughest endurance event in  the world and this guy is the first Australian to do it. What a remarkable man. What an inspiration to  everyone who is interested in sport.

STEVE PRICE:

I don’t want to prematurely retire you but when you’re out of politics it would be an incredible thing to  follow one of those tours and do some of the stages, wouldn’t it? How do you think you’d go in the Alps?

TONY ABBOTT:

Oh look, I would just trundle up the hill, that’s what I’d do. I would set myself a pace that I thought I could  maintain and I’d just let everyone else overtake me, Steve, that’s how I handle these things. But look, quite a  few mates of mine have that kind of thing. My former colleague Guy Barnett has been doing it just over the  last week or so and it is on my bucket list, put it that way!

STEVE PRICE:

It’d be a big list I suspect. Thanks for your time this morning.

TONY ABBOTT:

Good on you, Steve.
