INTERVIEW WITH KIERAN GILBERT

SKY NEWS AM AGENDA

24 NOVEMBER 2011

SUBJECTS: Asylum seekers, Malaysian Arrangement

KIERAN GILBERT:

Joining me now on the program is Liberal front bencher Bruce Billson  and Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer David Bradbury.  Gentlemen, good morning. This impasse continues over the asylum  seeker issue. We heard from Chris Bowen just a moment ago and  we're going to hear from Scott Morrison at nine o'clock. Both sides say  they are willing to compromise, but they're not willing to talk, they  haven't nutted out a way to get around the table. This is ridiculous.  David?

DAVID BRADBURY:

I think certainly that Mr Abbott has made it clear that he won't be  budging. We had an opportunity there as a Parliament to give the  executive powers that we need to put in place off-shore processing.  Post the High Court opinion, regardless of what legal opinion you rely  upon, clearly there is some doubt about whether or not our laws as  they currently exist, equip the executive with the power it needs to  implement off-shore processing. As Chris Bowen said, we have a  negotiated arrangement that we've negotiated through the Bali  framework ready to go. In fact it would've already been implemented  had it not been for the injunctive relief that was sought before the  High Court. We brought legislation before the House, Mr Abbott was  given the opportunity to support that legislation but he came out very  strongly saying what he says so consistently and that is 'no'.

GILBERT:

But David, the Government is the Government. If you're calling for  compromise talks, why don't you instigate it? Why don't you get on  the phone to Scott Morrison who says that he hasn't been called by  the Minister. This is the Government's matter, it has to be at the

Government's instigation, surely. Why don't you get on with it; it has  got to be above politics doesn't it?

BRADBURY:

Well the Coalition's policy to picking up the phone has always been  pick up the phone to Nauru or pick up the boat-phone to turn the  boats around and send them back to Indonesia. We have had  discussions, and that is a matter on the public record, that there have  been discussions. In fact the Prime Minister met with Mr Abbott when  this legislation was first being brought before the House. But Mr  Abbott has made it very clear and I see no change in his position. In  terms of picking up the phone, who picks the phone up first, the  bottom line is that the Government has legislation that we can bring  back before the Parliament at any time. That's ready to go. We have a  negotiated arrangement that we believe will work and I've got to say  that I think the reason why on this occasion Tony Abbott is saying no  is not just because he sees it to be in his short-term political interest  to keep this issue alive, but I think his greatest fear is that the  Malaysian Arrangement will work.

GILBERT:

Okay, let's go to Bruce. Respond to David on that issue. The  Government has the policy, it is backed by the advice of the officials  and I suppose the difference is now the one David referred to with Mr  Abbott and the Prime Minister not reaching an agreement, is that  we're facing an enormous influx of boats here. Another tragedy will  inevitably occur unless something is done.

BRUCE BILLSON - Well Kieran, let's look at the facts. There have been  more boat arrivals in the last three days than there was under the last  six years of the Howard Government. The Government likes to run  down the Nauru solution, yet it worked. The Government started  discussions with Papua New Guinea, now it doesn't want to conclude  those discussions. The Government's Malaysian so-called-solution  didn't see any abatement in boat arrivals, they kept coming. Then, the  High Court ruled it out of order because there was no mechanism to  protect the asylum seekers and their basic rights that we've signed up  to under the United Nations Convention. So what the Howard  Government did was make sure that those protections were there.  There was a disincentive for boat arrivals and people smugglers and it  worked. Six years and fewer arrivals than in the last three days...

GILBERT:

But why shouldn't the Government have the capacity to deliver a  policy of its own and you can hold them to account if it doesn't work?

BILLSON:

Well the Government said that it can't turn its back on the protections  that we have signed up to, this is the mistake that they made when it

5/03/2012 http://parlsec.treasurer.gov.au/DisplayDocs.aspx?doc=transcri...

came to the last Malaysian solution. In the legal enforceability of those  protections, those people that arrive in our care, we need to provide  protection to. What the Opposition has is pick any of more than 140  countries that have signed up to carry out those protections of asylum  seekers as we have signed up to do. Pick any of those. Pick any of  those countries like Papua New Guinea where the Government said  that it had instigated discussions. Pick any of those and we can get on  with it, honour our undertakings internationally to ensure that

protections for asylum seekers exist. When they land in our care or we  move them somewhere else, make sure that those protections are  there. There is 148 countries that can offer that but what the  Government has said is no to that broad suite of options that even  they said they were pursuing. It must be Malaysia, it must be

Malaysia. This is a discussion where this is it or there is no solution  from the Government's point of view. There are many options  available under the Opposition's approach. We could get this done  today, we could bring the Bill back. All they need to do is agree to  work with a country that has signed the Convention as Australia has  and we can get on with it. But they won't do it, they won't do it.

GILBERT:

To me it sounds like both sides are being as belligerent as one another  here.

BILLSON:

I think what is really going on here is this is the dirty deal that was  done dirt cheap. The Greens like this outcome, the Left of the Labor  Party like this outcome. Think of the gymnastics that the Government  has gone to get other measures through the Parliament. They're  $10bn down trying to get two taxes through. David jumps on a boat to  make it look like he is serious about border protection but no one will  get on a bike to talk with their alliance partners about whatever it is  the Government wants. The Government boasts that it gets its way all  the time. We have that in the Parliament, why not work *inaudible* as  it relates to this policy. There is something going on here.

BRADBURY:

Okay, okay, this is a grand conspiracy between the Government and  The Greens to deliver on-shore processing? You know what Bruce?

BILLSON:

What's that?

BRADBURY:

You can break that deal up straight away by coming into the  Parliament and supporting our plan for off-shore processing that would  deliver the Malaysian Arrangement. Now...

5/03/2012 http://parlsec.treasurer.gov.au/DisplayDocs.aspx?doc=transcri...

BILLSON:

Or you could pick from 140 other options...

BRADBURY:

I listened to you Bruce, I listened to you. Just give me a minute...

BILLSON:

No you interrupted me three times if I recall.

BRADBURY:

Just give me a minute. The issue here is not about a contest between  Nauru and Malaysia, it is about putting in place a solution that will  work in the current circumstances. Chris Bowen made a very good  point in your interview. He said that it is important for the Coalition to

come out and answer one simple question. If they were to implement  a Nauru strategy, where will the people that are processed on Nauru  as genuine refugees be resettled? Because that is the central question  here. Once the people smugglers and people looking to pay people  smugglers understand that if you get here and you get turned around  and sent to Nauru and you end up in Australia anyway, there is no  disincentive. The reason the Malaysian Arrangement will work, is  because it is the only arrangement where there is a country on the  other side that will be prepared to accept those people and put them  back through that queue. That is the genuine disincentive. Bruce says  that the Government should be finding a country which has signed up  to the Convention, but let's just put to one side the fact that they were  prepared to support Nauru before they signed the Convention. Lets  also put to one side the fact that countries like Iran are signatories to  the UN Convention. What they also need to make clear to the  Australian people is, where are the countries out there that have  signed the Convention that are prepared to be a part of a genuine  deal...

GILBERT:

Isn't that the Government's responsibility?

BRADBURY:

Just let me finish Kieran...

BILLSON:

They're outsourcing.

BRADBURY:

Where are the countries out there that are prepared to be a part of a  deal that would allow us to send people back and for them to be  processed in a way that does not lead to an automatic situation where

Page 4 of 7 Transcript - Asylum seekers, Malaysian Arrangement - Inter...

5/03/2012 http://parlsec.treasurer.gov.au/DisplayDocs.aspx?doc=transcri...

they get processed in that country and if they're refugees they are  sent to Australia.

GILBERT:

It is the Government's job to find those countries isn't it?

BRADBURY:

Well we found one. We found a country...

GILBERT:

Why not find one that is a signatory to the Convention?

BILLSON:

How about I have a go?

BRADBURY:

There aren't many out there. We've negotiated a deal, we're ready to  go with a deal and now on this point of principle that was not a point  of principle of any concern to them when they were sending people to

Nauru when it was not a signatory, they come in and so no. Well,  why?

GILBERT:

Bruce?

BILLSON:

Very quickly three points. That is not right. In Nauru, the signatory  issue, that is a lesser test to be a signatory. You know what was in the  Howard Government law? You actually needed to uphold those  commitments. There was a performance test that Nauru and Papua  New Guinea met. You could not meet that in Malaysia, that is why the  High Court struck it out. So to assist the Government, we've lowered  the bar. We've lowered the bar that says you don't actually have to  prove that you can meet those protection tests, just prove that you're  committed to implementing the Convention. There are avenues which  then performance can be pursued. So it is a lower test, a lower  demand for the care of people seeking asylum that the Coalition has  offered to assist the Government, and you've turned your back on it.  What we've got is a solution that worked. The evidence is in. Fewer  arrivals in six years than in three days and David is getting all  *inaudible* up about a so-called solution that in theory wants to  debate, but in practice it didn't work. It didn't work and they need to  work more collaboratively with the Coalition.

BRADBURY:

It didn't have a chance, it wasn't implemented.

GILBERT:

We are nearing closing time, we've got a minute left. Just in a one  word answer, should Minister Bowen and the Shadow Minister sit  around a table today with this influx happening and sort this out. Yes

or no?

BILLSON:

Yes, and bring the amendment from the Coalition into the Parliament.  140 options and the Government can work their way through them.

GILBERT:

David, just quickly, should they sit around and try to talk this through?

BRADBURY:

Of course, but Bruce says we should get together and resolve the  situation but then on the other hand he says as long as you agree with  what we've just said.

BILLSON:

No. We've given you 140 options, but you're demanding one that has  been proven not to work. Go figure that *inaudible*.

BRADBURY:

And where are the refugees processed on Nauru going to go?

GILBERT:

Happy Christmas to both of you, unfortunately the one word answers  don't work without discussions...

BILLSON:

It was just a number of one words.

BRADBURY:

I was happy to just say yes, he'll say no, he'll always say no.

BILLSON:

We didn't get to talk about diplomatic feng shui with China and the  United States. You know what real friends do? They don't tell you who  your other friends should be or how you should relate to them and you  should have good friends, we've had good friends and we should find  that feng shui again. Have a good Christmas.

GILBERT:

Thank you, that's a nice way to finish.
