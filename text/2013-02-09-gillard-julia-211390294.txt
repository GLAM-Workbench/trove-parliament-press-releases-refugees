PRIME MINISTER



TIES BETWEEN AUSTRALIA AND NEW ZEALAND STRENGTHENED AT  ANNUAL LEADERS TALKS

Australia and New Zealand will give their independent regulators new powers to  investigate the high cost of mobile roaming across the Tasman and to intervene in  the market to bring down prices.

Prime Minister Gillard made the announcement with New Zealand Prime Minister  John Key at their annual leaders' summit in New Zealand today.

The announcement marks the 30th anniversary of the Closer Economic Relations  (CER) agreement between the two countries.

CER has been critical in the economic development of both countries - bringing  down barriers to trade, reducing costs for business, encouraging investment and  creating jobs and economic growth.

Since CER came into effect in 1983, two-way trade has grown on average 8 per cent  per year.

To further deepen economic integration between the two countries, the two Prime  Ministers also announced that Australia and New Zealand would be:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ streamlining travel between the two countries through an $8 million trial of  automated border processing technology for departures from Australian  airports;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ driving investment by raising monetary thresholds for screening trans-Tasman  investment proposals through the entry into force of the CER Investment  Protocol from 1 March 2013;   Ã¢ÂÂ¢ assisting Australians and New Zealanders to consolidate retirement savings in

their country of residence, and avoid paying fees and charges on accounts  held in two countries, through the commencement of new superannuation  portability arrangements from 1 July 2013; and that  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ New Zealand has agreed to resettle 150 refugees who are subject to  Australia's offshore processing legislation

A new report into trans-Tasman telecommunications has found that the market is  characterised by a small number of participants, with wholesale margins, on  average, above 300 per cent and retail margins above 90 per cent.

The margins are well above the usual margins in the telecommunications sector of  around 10 per cent to 20 per cent.

Sending data can cost $20 per megabyte. One photo sent from a smartphone can  cost almost $40. Phone calls can range between $2 and $8.50 per minute, with text  messages around 75c each.



The report clearly demonstrates the need for government action on roaming  charges.  Consumers and businesses have had enough of being gouged and putting  up with high mobile roaming charges.

Under the proposals announced today, the independent regulators in Australia and  New Zealand will be empowered to take coordinated action.

The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) is currently unable  to resolve the issue for Australian customers with its existing powers.

We will both introduce legislation into the parliament that ensures that the regulators  are able to investigate, and if necessary, take action to regulate prices.

If the telecommunications providers act to bring down prices themselves, then of  course action by the two regulators will not be required.

This is just the tip of the iceberg. If we can drive down prices in New Zealand, we  can also start to act to bring about lower prices in other advanced economies such  as the European Union.

This proposal will allow Australian and NZ businesses and consumers to use, at  reasonable cost, their existing mobile devices and existing telephone numbers when  visiting each other’s country.

The joint report, prepared by the Department of Broadband, Communications and  the Digital Economy, and New Zealand's Ministry of Business, Employment and  Innovation, is available from the DBCDE website.
