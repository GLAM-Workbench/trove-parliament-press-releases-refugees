POLICY CHARTS AUSTRALIA’S COURSE INTO THE 
FUTURE

Â

The Coalition’s Immigration and Multicultural Affairs policy will 
build upon the significant refor ms Implemented to date, the Minister 
for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock, said today.

Â

Announcing the policy in Perth, Mr Ruddock said it 
continued the direction the Government had taken in delivering programs 
directly tailored to Australia’s national Interests.

Â

The Coalition has implemented reforms across all areas 
of the immigration and multicultural affairs programs Inherited from 
the Labor Party.

Â

"Australia’s Migration Program is now smaller 
and more focussed with emphasis on the skills of prospective migrants. 
More than 50 per cent of all entrants are now skilled compared to only 
22 per cent under Labor.

Â

"The Coalition has placed a greater emphasis 
on migrants’ English-language ability, and adopted measures to eliminate 
abuses that plagued the immigration program operated by Labor, particularly 
in the spouse categories.

Â

“This reform has delivered substantial financial 
benefits, with independent economic modelling demonstrating the Coalition’s 
program can deliver an economic benefit of $134 a person per year if 
It is maintained to the year 2007-2008.

Â

“The Coalition has made greater efforts to apprehend 
unlawful non-citizens with 62 per cent more locations made in the last 
financial year compared to the Labor Party's last year in office.

Â

“These reforms do not discriminate on the basis 
on race, gender, country or origin, and religion.

Â

“This Government has placed primacy on resettlement 
of people in urgent humanitarian need, with the number of places for 
refugees increasing from 3,334 in 1996-97 to 4,000 in 1997-98.

Â

“To strengthen this focus we have allocated an additional 
$8.8 million over two years to the Adult Migrant English Program (AMEP) 
to ensure that humanitarian entrants can to benefit from additional 
and more flexible English language training.

Â

“In recognition of the essential role community 
organisations play in the provision of settlement services, the Coalition 
will also provide an additional $10.4 million for an extension of the 
Community Settlement Services (CSS) Scheme.

Â

"I am proud to announce that the Coalition has 
honoured its pre-election promise to add $5 million to the Government’s 
Living In Harmony initiative, taking the total sum for the campaign 
to $10 million over two years.

Â

“There can be no doubt Australia is a nation of 
migrants that has benefited enormously economically, socially, and culturally 
from immigration and cultural diversity.

Â

“The Coalition’s reforms maximise these benefits, 
and restore the confidence of the Australian community that the ALP 
betrayed through mismanagement.

Â

"The continuation of this direction is necessary 
to build a strong and united country able to overcome the challenges 
presented by a complex and dynamic international environment.”
