TONY ABBOTT:

It’s good to be here at St Andrew’s Christian College. I want to thank Catriona, the staff and students and parents for  making Christopher Pyne, the Shadow Minister for Education, Alan Tudge, the local member, so welcome. We all know  that because Labor has been using schools funding as a political wedge that there has been great uncertainty about what  the outcome for schools next year is going to be. As far as I am concerned, as far as Christopher Pyne is concerned, as  far as the Coalition is concerned, we want to end the uncertainty by guaranteeing that no school will be worse off over the  forward estimates period.

So, we will honour the agreements that Labor has entered into. We will match the offers that Labor has made. We will  make sure that no school is worse off. We think that money is important. It's very important to educational outcomes that  schools are properly funded but money is not all that matters. What matters at least as much is good teachers, good  teaching, strong principals, strong parental and community engagement and strong curricula. This is what counts if we are  going to have the better schools that our students deserve and that our country needs.

The essential difference between Labor and the Coalition going into the coming election is not over funding, it's over the  amount of control that the Commonwealth Government should have. Under the Coalition, you'll get the funding but you  won't get the strings attached so what I want to say today is that as far as school funding is concerned, Kevin Rudd and I  are on a unity ticket. There is no difference between Kevin Rudd and myself when it comes to school funding. The  differences, if any, is over how schools should be run, how that funding should be utilised and I want to work

constructively with the states. I want to work as an adult government should work with the states to ensure that as far as is  possible in the years to come we have better teachers, better teaching, more autonomous principals, more parental and  community engagement and stronger curricula.

That's what the real school educational battleground should be over. How do we actually get better educational outcomes  by using a generous level of funding as effectively as possible? I'm going to ask Christopher to speak to this  announcement and then I might have a few observations on other subjects and then we'll take some questions.  Christopher?

CHRISTOPHER PYNE:

Thank you, Tony. The two key elements that we're announcing today in the education funding area are that we will adopt  exactly the same funding envelope as Labor over the forward estimates so that school principals and parents, that school  systems, states and territories can plan from 2014 and onwards knowing that they will attract exactly the same funds  whether they are in the new model or out of the new model that Labor would have given them if the school system had  gone ahead as planned.

So, Labor should have been doing this last year. They should have been planning a new model in 2012. They've left it all  far too late but in August it is time for there to be certainty of school funding going forward from 2014 and the Coalition is  giving that certainty today so you can vote Liberal or you can vote Labor and you'll get precisely the same funding  envelope regardless.

The real difference is going to be that the Coalition recognises that we don't own any schools, we don't run any schools,  whether they're non-government or government. Schooling is uniquely a responsibility of the states and territories and  rather than trying to control every aspect of the operations of schools from Canberra, we will dismantle in the Australian  education act those sections that would give the Commonwealth over-arching control of school systems whether they're  government or non-government around Australia.

So, the states and territories, the non-government schools can do what they do best which is teach students, run their  schools, manage their own budgets and funds. We will get the Commonwealth out of trying to have the central control and  command features from Canberra that the Labor Party's model envisages. So, I think this is very welcome news for the  schools sector. I think principals and parents will be delighted that we can now move the debate on from funding to things  like local decision-making, principal autonomy, a robust curriculum and parental engagement and good teacher quality.

TONY ABBOTT:

OK, just before we go to questions, the Government has confirmed that later today an economic statement will be  released. The Coalition will have more to say about this statement later in the day after it's been released but it is pretty  obvious now what you get from the Labor Party, whether Julia Gillard is the Prime Minister, whether Kevin Rudd is the  Prime Minister, what you get from Labor is more spending, more deficits and more boats. That's what you get from Labor.

Kevin Rudd has now been the Prime Minister for just over a month. What we've got in that time - three new taxes and  more than 4,000 illegal arrivals by boat. The boats keep coming, the deficit keeps mounting and the faceless men are still  in charge of the Labor Party. So, there couldn't be a clearer choice now confronting the Australian people and if you want  our country to be safe, secure and solvent, you've got to have the adults in charge and that means voting for the Coalition,  for your Coalition candidate, whenever this election is called and held.

Any questions?

QUESTION:

Tony, is this lazy politics to adopt Labor’s education plan?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I'm not on about the politics of this. I'm on about giving schools certainty. It's August, an election is yet to be called  and yet to be fought but schools need to let their parents know what will the fees be for next year. They need to plan for  their staffing for next year. The only way they can do that is if, as far as is humanly possible, the Coalition adds to the  certainty rather than do as this Government has been doing which is add to the uncertainty.

QUESTION:

Shouldn’t there be a range of checks and balances when you are injecting billions of dollars in education, that’s taxpayers  dollars. What is wrong with having checks and balances to make sure that money is spent well?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, what we don't need are new levels of intrusive bureaucracy from Canberra. I mean, under the Gillard-Rudd plan for  schools, the Education Minister in Canberra will be able to issue management plans, very detailed management plans, for  schools and for school systems. Schools are already very heavily regulated, there are already enormous amounts of  paperwork and bureaucracy that schools have got to comply with. We trust teachers, we trust schools, we trust principals  and school communities and why does Labor not trust them? Why does Labor always think that Canberra knows best?  And Christopher might like to add to that.

CHRISTOPHER PYNE:

The only thing I'd add to that is Labor wants to put school inspectors into schools from the Commonwealth Government.  They not only want to have another new institute, an Australian School Performance Institute to add to all the other  plethora of research groups and other councils that exist in the education space, they want - in the act there are specific  sections which allow the Commonwealth Minister to decide operational matters in schools, to remove funds if the Catholic  system, for example, wants to vary between their schools different amounts of money because they operate as a system,

they have to get approval from the Federal Minister and they have school inspectors who can go into every school make  sure that the school is doing exactly what the Commonwealth wants including counting students in classrooms.

Now, we don't run any schools. The states run schools and the non-government system runs schools. Decisions should  be made as locally as possible by schools and school systems. There is no necessity to establish another new layer of  bureaucracy in Canberra. In fact it's the worst thing we could. So, we aren't copying Labor's policy. We're saying on school  funding there will be certainty. In the funding envelope it will be precisely the same but we're going one step further and  removing the Commonwealth from being big brother, looking over the shoulders of school systems in states and territories  and allowing them to get on with the job they should be doing.

QUESTION:

Tony, now you are adopting the same funding model as the Government, will you get on the phone to Napthine and  encourage him to sign up?

TONY ABBOTT:

What I’ve said to all of my state colleagues is that they should act in the best interests of their states and the objection that  all of my state colleagues have had is to the additional level of Commonwealth control over schools. Now, under the  Coalition there will be the same funding without the extra strings attached. I would encourage Premier Napthine to do  what's in the best interests of Victoria but I've got to say that it would be in the best interests of Victoria to have a Coalition  government in Canberra which wants to sit down and talk to Victoria and the other states like one adult government to  another adult government rather than negotiate on a take it or leave it basis at the barrel of a gun.

QUESTION:

What are your thoughts on Kevin Rudd’s bank deposit levy?

TONY ABBOTT:

It's yet another tax. Just over a month, three new taxes. You buy a company car, you pay the company car tax. You put  your money in the bank, you pay the bank tax. You light up, you pay the cigarette tax. A little over three weeks, three new  taxes. Now, this is typical of a Labor government that just can't help itself. It can't control its own expenditure which is why  whenever it gets into trouble it hits you in the hip pocket. Well, it's just not good enough and if they do this to you before an  election - three new taxes before an election - just think how bad it will be after an election if this mob get re-elected.

QUESTION:

We’re not talking about average people though, we are talking about deposits of $250,000. Why not protect those people  and their lifesavings?

TONY ABBOTT:

But what problem do our banks have that requires this new impost upon them? I mean, Kevin Rudd ought to come clean.  What problem is there with our banking system that requires this new tax? And I think what we will discover is that the  banks don't have a problem. The Rudd Government has a problem, because the Rudd Government can't control its own  spending. See this for what it is. It's just another smash and grab raid on the Australian public from a government which is  desperate for money.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, the latest speculation is that an election will be called this weekend. If that happens what do you think your  chances are at the polls?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I'm not going to speculate on what anyone's chances might be. I'm just going to say that as far as I am concerned  the Coalition is more than ready for an election. As far as I judge the Australian people, they are more than ready to take  control of their government, to take control of their country because, frankly, for too long our country has been in the

hands of the faceless men. The Prime Ministership has been the plaything of the faceless men of the Labor Party. We've  seen, courtesy of the New South Wales anti-corruption commission, the real nature of the Labor Party exposed in the last  few days. Sam Dastyari, at the heart of the New South Wales Labor machine, is Kevin Rudd's numbers man. Sam  Dastyari was wearing out the carpet to Eddie Obeid's office for years. Basically, Kevin Rudd is part of a giant self-help  network. That's what he is. That's what the Labor Party has become, a network of self-help and nepotism. Well, the only  way to reform the Labor Party is to send them to opposition so that they can work out again who they stand for, who they

represent and what their real values are.

QUESTION:

What kind of election campaign what can we expect from the Coalition given Mr Rudd’s renewed popularity?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I'm very happy to see Mr Rudd's popularity, my own popularity, the standing of our respective parties tested in the  only way that matters, at an election. What people will be getting from the Coalition is clear plans, Real Solutions. For the  last three years the Coalition's had the same strong team and the same clear plans. By contrast, from Labor you've had

an absolute cavalcade of division and dysfunction. We've had in a little over three years we’ve had six small business  ministers, five assistant treasurers, four immigration ministers and  we've had two changes of Prime Minister and all of the  things that Mr Rudd has pretended to do since returning to the Prime Ministership prove that everything that the Coalition  has been saying about this government is true. They've it wrong over boats. They've got it wrong over internal party  management. They’ve got it wrong on economic management. They've got it wrong when it comes to cost of living and the  damage that the carbon tax is doing to job security and family budgets. This a government which has got it wrong at every  turn on their own admission so why on earth would anyone reward them with three more years like the last six?

Thank you.
