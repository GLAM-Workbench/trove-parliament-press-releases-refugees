HEALTH CHANGES 'DISADVANTAGED' PATIENTS

In the May Bulletin I reported on the proposed health changes  and since then the Health Acts Amendment Bill has been passed  in both Houses of the Parliament (11 June).

The following points in the legislation, which defines  disadvantaged status, are noted:

.  From 3rd August 1981 application forms will be available  in the Department of Social Security and Post Offices,  although the actual scheme does not begin until 1 September  1981.

.  Refugees or migrants arriving in Australia after 1 March  1981 can be classified as disadvantaged.

.  Unemployment and special beneficiaries will receive health  care cards with their fortnightly cheques.

.  Unemployment and special beneficiaries will also be covered during the 7 days' waiting period if they need  medical or hospital treatment.

.  The card will cover:

(a) bulk-billing if the doctor is willing to do so; (b) 85% of the schedule fee if he will not bulk bill; (c) free standard ward care in a public hospital; (d) free outpatient care in a public hospital; and (e) optometrical services

Allowable income refers to the previous four weeks'  payment  calculated in the following way and related to unemployment  benefit:-For single persons

Unemployment benefit $53.45

Allowable earnings before  U.B. cuts out 22.00

Plus $20 20.00

(Rounded to next $) $96.00

Single unemployed to be 60% of the married rate

For Families

Unemployment benefit $111.10

Allowable earnings before 28.00 U.B. cuts out Plus $20 20.00

(Rounded to next $) $160.00

Plus $20 for each child

-2-

(Only the married unemployment benefit cdmponent will be indexed  So twice-yearly CPI rises will apply to 70% of the $160, not the  whole amount).

Allowable income excludes family allowances, double .   orphans 1  pension, handicapped, children'  s allowance  and funeral benefit.

It includes repatriation pensions, overseas pensions  and seamen's pensions.

In the case of an unmarried person only children  additional to the first will be counted:

i.e. single parent + 1 child = married rate of $160 single parent + 2 children = $180 allowable income.

If in any period of four weeks the income is 25% above  allowable income, the 1  disadvantaged'  status is revoked.

If the Director-General of the Department of Social  Services revokes the disadvantaged status of a migrant,  refugee or low income earner, this is to be done in  writing.

If a dependant has ceased to be a dependant, the '   Department should be notified within four weeks.

Penalties

a. For making a misleading statement orally or in writing  or presenting a false document in support of a  1  disadvantaged1  claim - $500 or 6 months’  imprisonment

bÂ· False claim to a medical practitioner, fund or hospital  proprietor by misrepresentation as *  disadvantaged1  -$500 or 6 months1  imprisonment

c Â·  Failure to furnish any information and documents regarding  disadvantaged status when required by the Director-General -$100

dÂ· Failure to notify the Director-General that the income  over a 4 week period had risen by more than 25% above  allowable income $100

e Â·  Failure to notify within four weeks that a dependant  has ceased to have dependant status -

$100

f Â·  Failure to return a 1  disadvantaged1  card on receipt of notification that the Director-General has revoked it -$100

-3-

(g) Failure to appear, answer questions,  provide documents  with respect to disadvantaged claim when required by the  Director General - $100

Money paid by the Commonwealth as a result of misrepresentation  as a disadvantaged person is recoverable from the person or  the person’6 estate.

The Director-General of Social Services can communicate  any information relating to the 1  disadvantaged1  to the  Director-General of Health.

If a person's disadvantaged status is revoked, that person  will not have to serve a waiting period if joining a health  fund.

There is no waiting period in respect of pre-existing  illnesses.

Administration of 'disadvantaged' status

According to the A.C.O.A., the anticipated numbers of  recipients are -(a) migrants/refugees - 50,000 people, 25,000 cards;

(b) Unemployed and special benefit recipients - 500,000  people, 320,000 cards;

(c) Low income people - 475,000 people, 175,000 cards.

There will be files to be maintained, duplicate cards to  be issued and field officers and benefits control staff  to check on fraud. This will present an overworked  Social Security staff with serious additional problems, but

the Department has not told the A.C.O.A. the number of  new staff that will be needed.

Appeal against dismissal of a disadvantaged claim or  revocation of a health care card will be made on the same  basis as other appeals through the Department of Social  Security, the Social Security Appeal Tribunals and if  necessary, the Administrative Appeals Tribunals. Tribunals

are already well behind as a result of a backlog of  invalid pension appeals, and new Tribunal members and staff  will have to be appointed.

REFUGES BETRAYED

Women's refuges across Australia will suffer as a result of the  Fraser Government's insistence on passing funding responsibility  back to the States.  Programs set up during the Whitlam years  which were endorsed in 1979 by the responsible Liberal Minister

have fallen victim to the disease of new federalism.

The tent city erected by women's refuge activists on the lawns  opposite Parliament House, together with the eviction of  chanting protestors from Kinas Hall and the Parliamentary

galleries provided a sensational backdrop to a fundamental  debate on the role and future of refuges, rape crisis centres  and women's health centres.

It is significant that two retiring Labor Senators, Senator Jean  Melzer and Justin O'Byrne, used their final hours in the Senate  to support the women's cause against the callousness of  Government Senators whose only concern appeared to be with  protecting the respectability of the Parliamentary portals.

The Government's decision to hand over refuge funding to the  States was contained in provisions of the States (Tax Sharing)  legislation which finally passed through the Senate on party  lines. During the Committee stages of debate, I moved an  amendment to ensure the payment of Commonwealth funds to the  States specifically for women's refuges, but this too was  defeated, with the Government's women Senators voting against  it.

The biggest danger to existing refuges lies in States whose  conservative governments are opposed to the very notion of  women's refuges. These are of course, Queensland and Western  Australia. But even where States acknowledge the tremendous work

done by the refuges, the refuge dollar will now have to compete  with every other health-related community demand.

Some 35,000 women pass annually through the 100 or so funded  refuges in Australia and two-thirds of them have children. All are escaping from intolerable conditions at home. As  unemployment and poverty increase, so will the pressures.

The women who run the refuges are grossly underpaid. Often  two or more share a salary. They work in conditions which are  emotionally draining and physically unsatisfactory; if refuges

; . 5.,

were under the control of labour regulations and were unionised,  the conditions would not be tolerated. -

As I said in the Senate debate:

"No matter how inappropriate Government Senators  may consider the actions which were taken last tweek,  no matter how disturbed the more sensitive souls Ã¢ÂÂ  in this Parliament may be by such a display of

frustration and anger, the complaints are real and  these people's problems are severe and will not go  away. They perform a service for which they receive  little recognition and they certainly receive  inadequate support. We should insist that funds for  refuges are increased".

WHEELCHAIRS - TARIFF TO STAY

In the early hours of 2 June 1981, the Customs Tariff  Validation Bill providing for retention of the tariff on  imported wheelchairs was passed in the House of Representatives.

Under the Act the tariff will be progressively reduced over  two years from its present level of 34% (electric chairs) or  36% (manually operated chairs) to 20%. The final rate will  still be 5% higher than that applying before 1 January 1980.

The Government has taken this action in direct opposition to  the advice of the disabled lobby. Rather than a tariff which  lays the burden of protecting a local industry directly  with the consumer, the Australian Council for Rehabilitation of  Disabled (ACROD) argued for a bounty so that the Government  would pick up the tab.

The wheelchair industry in Australia employs a grand total  of 55 people and it is not surprising that most chairs are  imported. People who require a lightweight flexible

electric chair have no choice but to buy an imported one  because such chairs are not made here.

In announcing the tariff decision the Government drew attention  to the scheme for provision of aids for disabled people (PAD)  which is just being implemented (see report below). However,  there was no acknowledgement of the fact that the allocation

for all aids ($700,000 for three months, implying $2.8m.  annually) is less than the annual sales of wheelchairs which  alone amount to $4 million.

Clearly, the Government saw the issue from the point of view  of the industry, not disabled people. The Minister for  Business and Consumer Affairs soelt this out in the debate:

"I know that the Australian Labor Partv has a  bleedina heart from time to time.  but the  relevance is to industrv".

I stronalv endorse ACROD's comment "the Government obviously  does not understand the problems faced by disabled people in  obtaining aids for daily living".

BLUEPRINT FOR A BETTER APPEALS SYSTEM

Defects in the Department of Social Security administration and  in the appeals system were noted in the Report of the  Administrative Review Council which was presented to Parliament  in June 1981.

The Report claimed that applicants for benefits and pensions  were not afforded similar protection to that given claimants under  other Commonwealth legislation.

In the procedures of the Social Security Appeals Tribunals  claimants are frequently disadvantaged by:

.  lack of full information as to the case to be met; .  lack of an opportunity to answer the Department's case; .  The use of anonymous heresay evidence; .

1 '  Lack of access to documents in files of the Department of Social Security; and .  inability to understand the issues, the Department's  policy, their rights, and how to present a case.

The Report recommends that extra resources should be made available  within the Department to ensure better fact-finding and more correct  primary decisions.

The importance of getting decisions right the first time is  illustrated by the following table supplied by Senator Chaney on 2 April 1981. Almost half the appeals were conceded by the  Department before they reached the Tribunal or received favourable  recommendation by the Tribunal. This is evidence of unsatisfactory  decision-making in the Department.

SOCIAL SECURITY APPEALS TRIBUNALS - NUMBER OF APPEALS LODGED AND

NUMBER FINALISED - AUSTRALIA

1977-78 1978-79 1979-80

(a) Appeals lodged ............ 17,084 9,312 6,704

(b) Appeals finalised ......... 17,522 10,200 6,405

(c) Appeals conceded without  reference to Tribunals .. . 5,848 3,106 1,803

(d) Favourable recommendations  of Tribunals .............. 2,063 1,701 1,243

(e) Appeals upheld or partly  upheld by Department ...... 1,567 1,490 1,170

(f) Appeals disallowed by  Department ............... 496 211 73

(g) Appeals disallowed by Dept  as per cent of favourable  recommendations of Tribunals . 24.0 12.4 5.9

Among the recommendations of the Administrative Review Council were

. An advice and assistance system for claimants in each State,  to comprise lawyers, social workers and beneficiaries with  expertise;

AIDS FOR DISABLED (PAD SCHEME) UPDATE

The Opposition's concerted attack on the Government for the  ten-month delay in implementing the PAD scheme has produced  some result.

In late May and early June the Minister for Health made  a series of announcements about agreements reached with  the States. Victoria is to receive an allocation of  $176,000, Queensland $102,000, Western Australia $57,000, Tasmania $29,000, the A.C.T. and Northern Territory $22,000  each. A total of $408,000 has thus been committed.

It is of great concern that arrangements had not been  finalised with New South Wales or South Australia by the end  of the financial year, which means that almost $300,000 will  return to consolidated revenue.

Even in the States that have reached an agreement with the  Commonwealth,  there are no details publically available about  how the scheme will work.

Several aspects should be closely watched:-Choice of aid/appliance:  How much choice between models will a disabled person have? For example,  will he or she have to

accept a locally made electrical wheelchair when an imported  one would be more suitable?

Referral and Procedures:  How many stages, visits and interviews  will the referral process involve? Will there be any avenue of  appeal against rejections of an application? Will there be a  system of priorities in allocation?

Effect on existing services:  It is likely that hospitals will cease free provision of appliances in the light of their proposed  charges, and thus add an unplanned-for extra demand on the PAD  scheme. Willit be able to cope?

Although the scheme is said to be 'on-going* there are no  guarantees about the size of it. In the face of the dearth of  Australian statistics about the number of disabled people,  the  first allocation was little more than a stab in the dark and

the next budget will be decided without benefit of any feedback.

Particular vigilance about budgetary allocations will be needed  in 1982 because by then more facts about the numbers and needs  of disabled people will be known and they will have to fight for

. . 8 . .

their rights without the limelight of I .Y.D.P.

OVERSEAS PENSIONS - CANCELLATION IN ABSENTIA

Senator Chaney has given a disturbing answer to a question I  placed on notice on 31st March regarding the cancellation of  pensions paid overseas.

Question:  Is it usual for them (overseas pensioners whose pensions are cancelled) to be called in for interviews before  cancellation of their pensions?

Answer:  No. The honourable Senator would be aware that many pensioners would have difficulty in attending either of the  two overseas offices located in Geneva and London for an  interview prior to cancellation of pension. Where persons

are able and willing to visit one of these offices, and  interview is arranged.

This is a summary form of justice indeed. All pensioners should  have the opportunity to hear and to answer the evidence that  led to the cancellation of their pension.

STOP PRESS ON HEALTH CHANGES

Pensioners Deliberately Misled

As many as 340,000 pensioners may be frightened into taking out  unnecessary health insurance as a result of a letter from the  Department of Social Security. The letter states that if they are  not eligible for a pensioner health benefit card they are  responsible for their own health costs.

This contradicts the Department's own estimates that 340,000  pensioners who are not eligible for PHB cards will be eligible  for disadvantaged cards.  The Department of Social Security letter  makes no mention of this,and lone parents particularly could be  affected by this misinformation. For example, a lone parent with  one child loses the PHB card at $137.65, but retains eligibility

for the disadvantaged card until they receive more than $160.00.

Inequalities in calculation of 'disadvantaged'

A man earning $199 who has a wife and two children will be  considered disadvantaged and entitled to free hospital and medical  cover. A man earning $201 with the same sized family will not.

The health needs of the two families have been completely ignored. If there is chronic illness in the second family,for example, asthma,  they will be faced with recurrent expenses which will put them in a  worse position than the 'disadvantaged'  family.

Chronically ill people who narrowly miss qualifying as 'disadvantaged'   have been shamefully mistreated by the Government's new health scheme.
