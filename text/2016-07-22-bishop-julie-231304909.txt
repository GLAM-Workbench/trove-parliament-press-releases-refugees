HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE TO AFRICAN COUNTRIES

The humanitarian crisis in South Sudan, Somalia and countries in the Lake Chad basin is  worsening due to the effects of El Nino and conflict in the region.

Today I announce that the Australian Government will provide a further $17.5 million to  support people suffering from severe hunger and malnutrition, and those displaced from their  homes and in need of protection from conflict.

Australia will provide $8 million to the South Sudan Humanitarian Fund and the UN High  Commissioner for Refugees. This funding will help deliver food, shelter, security, and other  vital assistance including to South Sudanese who have fled to neighbouring countries. This  brings Australia’s total contribution to South Sudan to more than $50 million since December  2013.

In Somalia, 1.1 million people have been displaced by terrorist activity and conflict.  Australia  will provide $4.5 million to Somalia, including $2.5 million to World Vision to help build the  resilience of Somali communities and $2 million to the Somalia Humanitarian Fund for  immediate life-saving assistance, including food, healthcare and water.

Australia will also provide $5 million through the World Food Programme for immediate food  supplies, livelihood training and nutrition in the Lake Chad basin region. Over 2.1 million  people have been forced to flee their homes as a result of the Boko Haram insurgency and  7.5 million people are in need of urgent food assistance.

This assistance comes from humanitarian funding within the existing Australian Aid budget.
