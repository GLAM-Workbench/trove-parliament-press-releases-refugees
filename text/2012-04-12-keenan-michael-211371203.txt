Michael Keenan MP - Federal Member for  Stirling 2UE Interview with Mike Jeffreys April 03, 2012

Topics: Labor’s Border Protection failure

Mike Jeffreys

We have 16,000 illegal arrivals and if you follow through with the family reunion on that it ends up being about 65,000 and  no sign of stopping. The boats keep coming. To comment further Michael Keenan, Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs  and Border Protection.

Michael Keenan

Hi Mike, good to talk to you.

Mike Jeffreys

I suppose in Australian parlance that kind of irony we indulge in it’s going well isn’t it?

Michael Keenan

It’s going incredibly badly, the boat arrival that we intercepted overnight took the total to over 16,000 people who have  arrived here illegally since the Labor Party came to office and weakened the robust system of border protection that they  inherited from the Howard Government and that has cost the Australian people incredibly dearly. It has cost us almost $4  billion and it has also cost us in terms of our international reputation and our inability to control our own immigration  system. Mike I think you have put it well, it is going very very badly and the worst part is that the Labor Party doesn’t  intend to do anything about it, they have just accepted that this is the way it is and they refuse to take any action to fix the  problem that they created.

Mike Jeffreys

Just on that score, I’m not usually one for ascribing motives, I’m more interested in what people actually do but in this case  why are they doing this? Do they have no other solution or is it to appease the open borders crowd and the Greens?

Michael Keenan

I’m not sure why they are doing this particularly when there is a solution on the table that they could take and they could  stop this from happening. There just doesn’t seem to be any rationale and I have given up trying to work out what their  motivations might be. It is incredibly damaging to our country and it is costing us an absolute fortune yet their response is  to just not do anything and I find that response particularly galling considering we know what needs to be done. We have  faced this problem before and we have been able to fix it and if we would return to that point of policies we could fix it  again. That is what I find particularly galling about this issue is that the Labor party knows what they have to do to do  something but they just won’t take it and I am not sure what stops them from doing that.

Mike Jeffreys

It is very expensive and Greg Sheridan wrote a good piece in The Australian today, it’s going to cause a lot of social  problems down the track. Now this business of 90 days and you’re out, what’s your comment on that?

Michael Keenan

We don’t support that because we don’t think it is acceptable to put an arbitrary time frame on processing people. It can  be very difficult for authorities to even work out the identity of someone who has arrived here illegally because in most  cases they don’t have any identity documents.

Mike Jeffreys

But in most cases they do that deliberately, do they not?

Michael Keenan

That’s exactly right. They are told by people smugglers to destroy their identity documents and of course they wouldn’t be  able to take the other steps that they have taken to get to Indonesia and the jumping off point without identity documents.

Mike Jeffreys

That’s exactly right. I mean isn’t the point here that if they have enough money to pay people smugglers then they have  enough money to get on a plane but they won’t get on a plane because they will have to provide identity documentation to  get on a plane?

Michael Keenan

You need a visa before you can get on a plane so presumably they wouldn’t be able to get a visa to get into Australia and

that’s why they take this route illegally through Indonesia. The 90 day rule would be administratively incredibly difficult as  people who arrived here illegally would know that they just had to wait out this 90 days and then they would be released  into the community and I do not think that is a particularly helpful way to structure our system. At the end of the day Mike  none of this matters if we could stop people coming here in the first place. We don’t need to be worried about 90 day rules  and we don’t need to be concerned about the length of time that people are detained if we can stop people coming here  illegally in the first place and that always has to be the main goal of our policies.

Mike Jeffreys

Now this has been going on for quite a while, can you just briefly outline the Opposition policy and/or where you would be  prepared to compromise with the Government to put a stop to this?

Michael Keenan

We would work with the Government to find a solution, we are very happy to do that but what they would have to do is  embrace a solution that we know works. We know what works because as I said we have used it in the past and that is a  return to offshore processing on Nauru, we would return to Temporary Protection Visas because as soon as you do that  you undermine the product that the people smugglers are selling which is permanent residence to Australia, and we would  also turn the boats back around where it is safe and appropriate to do so. If we were to embrace those policies then we  know we would stop people smuggling and that is what I would urge the Labor party to do. If they were going to do that  then we would work with them through the Parliament to implement those policies. There is certainly no problem there but  sadly that’s exactly the things that they have refused to do meanwhile they have had every available policy prescription  apart from the one that makes a difference.

Mike Jeffreys

Michael I appreciate your time and comments. Thanks for that.

Michael Keenan

Always good to talk to you Mike.
