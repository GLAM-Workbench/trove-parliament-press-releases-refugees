GREENS PREFERENCE LABOR OVER LIBERALS  IN CUNNINGHAM



The Illawarra Greens will preference the ALP over the Liberals at the forthcoming  federal election, Member for Cunningham  Michael Organ said today.

“Precise details about preference allocation will be announced following the  closure of nominations.”

“The Greens are a party of principle. Preferences are allocated according to the  policies and actions of individual parties and candidates.”

“There is no doubt that the Liberal Party under John Howard has pursued  policies which are at odds with Greens core principles.”

“Locally, the failure of the government to properly fund our public education  system, allocate Wollongong Hospital an MRI machine licence, provide  assistance with expansion of Port Kembla harbour and deal which long term  unemployment are negatives for the Liberal Party.”



“At a national level the Howard government’s treatment of asylum seekers, its  attacks on Medicare, cutbacks in welfare services and attacks on unions and  workers rights are shameful.”

“The Greens also have concerns with the policies and direction of the ALP under  Mark Latham. Their support for the US Free Trade Agreement, for dearer  medicines, and for the construction of an international airport at Wilton did not  make the decision an easy one.”  Michael Organ said.
