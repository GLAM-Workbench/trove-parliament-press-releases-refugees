Health Panel needed as dengue fever puts  children at risk

In the midst of a dengue fever outbreak in the Australian detention camp on Nauru, the Greens  have renewed their call for an Independent Health Advisory Panel for offshore detention  centres.

“The Australian Government is forcing children and babies to live in the midst of a dengue fever  outbreak,” the Greens’ immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.

“An independent panel of experts to oversee the medical and psychological health of refugees  in these camps is an absolute necessity.

“The Government can’t control these types of outbreaks in the harsh detention camp  environment. With seven families to a tent, it’s impossible to keep children safe from the  disease.

“Children should never have been locked up in these conditions and, with no independent medical access,  the risk to their physical and mental health is extremely serious.

“All children, families and anyone affected by dengue fever must be taken from the island  immediately and returned to Australia.”
