PRESS STATEMENT

FRASER POLICY AIDS POL POT

Australia's stubborn recognition of the Pol Pot regime now  amounts to aid to the group's guerilla, terrorist and  political activities, Senator Ken Wriedt said today.

Senator Wriedt, Opposition spokesman on foreign affairs, said  persistent press reports from the Thai-Kampuchean border  show the Pol Pot forces are active there in ways which  exploit the diplomatic recognition it receives.

"If diplomatic recognition was withdrawn, as the Labor Party,  supported by the Foreign _Minister, is urging,the Pol Pot  forces' murderous and destabilising actions could be  restricted. Pol Pot is exploiting diplomatic recognition  to act as a political and military force on Kampuchea's  border with Thailand".

Senator Wriedt said the Pol Pot forces control refugee camps  in Thailand and the supply of much of the international aid  to them. They also control or terrorise many of the refugees.  From the bases in the refugee camps Pol Pot guerillas  operate into Kampuchea, sometimes under cover of refugee  movements which they enforce.

Senator Wriedt said there were confirmed media reports that  twice recently Pol Pot guerillas had blown up trains  carrying refugees and other civilians.

"All this Pol Pot activity has now clearly shifted the -   question of recognition from one of diplomatic formality  to one in which that recognition aids and abetts Pol Pot  actions hardly less murderous than those it carried out when

it was in power up to 1978".

Senator Wriedt pointed out that Australian and international  aid agencies have stated that recognition of Pol Pot hampers  aid delivery to Kampuchean refugees. .

"On that ground alone, the Fraser policy is intolerable".   said Senator Wriedt. .
