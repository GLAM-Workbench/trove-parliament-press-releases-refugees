Democrats support NGOs' call for UN action on the Sri Lankan crisis The Australian Democrat's spokesperson on foreign affairs, Senator Vicki Bourne today added her voice to growing international concerns about the humanitarian crisis developing in Sri Lanka.

"The safety and security of 500,000 civilians are being threatened. The situation is becoming increasingly volatile and dangerous," Senator Bourne said.

"This conflict has been long and brutal, over 1 million people have been internally displaced, 65,000 have been killed and another 600,000 refugees have fled the country.

"The only way to bring peace is through dialogue and negotiation and through a cease-fire in order to support the peace negotiations currently being championed by India and Norway," Senator Bourne said.

"I support calls from the NGO community requesting the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to visit Sri Lanka to assess the situation. I also urge them to provide ongoing monitoring of the humanitarian situation," Senator Bourne said.

"All parties must abide by international humanitarian law and ensure the safety of civilians. This includes not only safety from cruel and inhumane treatment, taking of hostages and forced relocation, but also a commitment to ensuring humanitarian needs are provided for," Senator Bourne concluded.
