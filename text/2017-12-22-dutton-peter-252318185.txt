PETER DUTTON:

I firstly want to deal with the issue in Melbourne; a terrible circumstance and our thoughts

and prayers go to all of those people that have been affected by this terrible incident. To

those people that are still in hospital, to those people that have witnessed this horrific

scene, most importantly at the moment to acknowledge all of the great work of the

paramedics, the police, Victorian Police and in particular the Sergeant who was off-duty at

the time, but intervened in this incident. We don't know what the next phase of this

incident may have been, but the intervention from the off-duty officer is quite remarkable.

There will be stories of heroic acts and thoughts and all sorts of feelings and emotions, no

doubt that will flood to the surface, but we will look at those individual heroic acts, we will

look at those acts that people undertook to help save a loved one or to intervene in a way

that could have put their own life at risk and we honour all of those people. It's amazing in

these circumstances, in the hour of need, when people step forward and we really pay

tribute to all of those people and as I say, those stories will undoubtable will come out in

due course.

It's important to recognise though that the investigation is still underway. The Australian

Federal Police and ASIO and other federal agencies including the Australian Border Force are

working very closely with the Victorian Police Force. I want to say thank you very much to

Lisa Neville, the Police Minister in Victoria, as well as Premier Andrews, for the briefings and

updates that we were provided yesterday and into last night and obviously a lot of work

that's gone on overnight and again this morning.

We work very closely, particularly during this incidence. There's a lot of effort that goes on  behind the scenes, but all the work from our Counter-Terrorism Unit officers within the  Australian Federal Police, the officers within ASIO and the way in which they collaborate  with their Victorian colleagues is quite remarkable, its first class and I pay full tribute to all of  those officers that have been involved.

But there is a long way to go in this investigation. There's a lot of information that is being  uncovered and all of that will be provided when appropriate in due course and no doubt the  Victorian Police will provide further updates.

I also wanted to provide you with some information in relation to this biggest bust in  Australia's history of methamphetamine out of Western Australia. It's a fact as we know  that Australia is a source destination because Australians will pay a lot of money for illicit  substances and particularly at this time of year, we're very pleased that 12 million hits of

methamphetamine will be off the streets over the Christmas-New Year period.

This is a 1.2 tonne seizure and that is worth $1 billion. So this is a billion dollar bust and it's a  great credit to the Australian Federal Police, to the West Australian Police and the Australian  Border Force, AUSTRAC and the other agencies that have been involved very intimately in  uncovering this haul. This will make a huge impact, but it's not the only case that police are

investigating at the moment and if people have further information they should contact the  police through Crime Stoppers. Any information at all is absolutely essential that people  provide that.

The third issue that I just wanted to raise very quickly is that there will be about 1.7 million  movements - 1.7 million people moving across our borders over the Christmas-New Year  period. I want to pay tribute to the Australian Border Force officers and the work they will  do to quickly move people in and out of our international airports and the work that our  Australian Federal Police and the other agencies will do at our international and domestic  airports.

So please expect that, as is always the case at Christmas and in the New Year, many people  are moving through our airports, so please allow plenty of time.

But again, all of these officers - whether it's at our airports, at our sea ports, on these sorts  of operations across the country, our Federal Police, our ASIO officers, our Australian Border  Force officers - all of them are working around the clock to keep Australians safe and if  anybody has any information, particularly over this Christmas period; something that they

might have overheard, something that they've seen that would cause them to be suspicious  about that activity, if they think it's terrorism related, they need to call the terrorism hotline  and that is 1800 123 400. Provide that information; that snippet of information could  prevent an attack over this period and if you can contact authorities with that information  we would be very grateful.

I'm happy to take any questions.

QUESTION:

On the Flinders Street incident, have authorities been able to definitely rule out it being a  terror attack?

PETER DUTTON:

No we haven't and we're not ruling in or out anything at the moment.

If you look at the circumstances where people have been mowed down by this person in the  car, that is a very serious circumstance and so in light of that - and obviously all of our CT  officers within the Australian Federal Police, officers within ASIO, the Australian Border  Force - all of them are working very closely to look at every aspect, every detail of this case  with the Victorian Police at the moment and so I don't want to pre-empt anything, but we  are certainly not ruling out a terrorist link and we certainly aren't drawing any conclusions at  this stage.

QUESTION:

Have we learnt anything more about the suspect today? I understand Victoria Police were  hoping to interview him at some point.

PETER DUTTON:

Obviously that will take place, if it hasn't already taken place. The Victorian Police are the  lead organisation in relation to that matter. The Australian Federal Police are working very  closely with them. So they will run down all of those leads. They will look at gathering of all  the information and intelligence as you'd expect and our agencies have certainly been  working through the night with the Victorian Police to try and put this picture together

because we want people to realise that this is an isolated incident. People should go about  their business in the run-up to Christmas with shopping, with the start of their holidays, but  be conscious of what's going around you, particularly in places of mass gathering.

The police at a federal and state level have done an enormous amount of work to try and  deal with the threat, to try and neutralise that threat, but we know now that 81 people have  been charged with terrorist related offences over the course of the last three years or so.  We have returning foreign fighters and as we've seen in the incident in Victoria in the last 24

hours or so, this is an issue for us as a Western democracy, as we have seen in other parts of  the world and we need to be realistic about the threat that we face and we need to provide  the police with any snippet of information that people might have - something they've  overheard at a family gathering, in a workplace, something they've seen out in public  otherwise - provide that information to the police, call the terrorism hotline; 1800 123 400,

provide that information because you may well be providing the police with that bit of  information that could stop the next attack from taking place.

QUESTION:

The Queensland Police Commissioner yesterday said that it's a matter of time before we see  an attack here in Queensland. The Commonwealth Games are just around the corner  [inaudible] concerns at all?

PETER DUTTON:

Well all I can say is that the police â€”whether it's here in Queensland or in Victoria in this  case, otherwise right around the country - have put an enormous amount of effort into the  Counter-Terrorism Units and all of the training that's taken place. There's a very, very close  collaboration between the States and Territories and the Commonwealth as well. Obviously  we have worked very closely over the last 24 hours with the Victorian Police and long before  that. There's joint training exercises that take place. In the case of the Commonwealth  Games, there is a big Commonwealth picture both in terms of the Home Affairs Department

now, with the Australian Federal Police and the agencies otherwise, but also the Australian  Defence Force working very closely with the Queensland Police and we want to make sure  that we keep people safe in the Commonwealth Games, in the run up to the  Commonwealth Games, at cricket events, football events - whatever it might be throughout  the calendar year. There are lots of places where people do gather in mass numbers;  shopping centres and the like and we've been working very closely with the state agencies.

The Commonwealth has put $1.5 billion additional money into the counter-terrorism space  and our agencies over the course of the last couple of years and we'll continue to work very  closely with the state police agencies.

QUESTION:

The Victorian Police say this man was known to them. They had looked into him. Could this  have been prevented?

PETER DUTTON:

Well all of that information obviously will be examined and very closely examined, but at  the moment, all of what I have seen indicates to me that the police both at the Victorian  level, the Australian Federal Police level, have done an excellent job.

The intervention by the off-duty sergeant was an heroic act and....

[break in audio]

we are facing a significant threat and the police and intelligence officers are working around  the clock to keep all of us very safe. But the activities and the information that's been  provided to me, I can assure you that the police have done an excellent job in the lead-up to  this issue and as a result of it.

QUESTION:

Locally here at the airport two years ago a man crashed his car straight through the terminal  in a similar attack. Should companies and organisations start taking more responsibility  around security?

PETER DUTTON:

There's a lot of work that has been done both at a State and Local government level, but  also at a Federal Government level as well. We have been working closely with a number of  organisations, private enterprise, Government buildings and the like in trying to harden  those buildings, trying to address some of the soft targets and trying to put in place

measures that would counter mass attacks.

So there's a lot of work that's already underway and the Prime Minister has really shown  leadership in this area, taken the lead in putting out a very important discussion paper, a  very important engagement piece with many of the places of mass gathering around the  country. We saw off the back of Bourke Street obviously and as we have seen in Sydney and

Brisbane elsewhere, where we have got thoroughfares, malls, where people are walking and  the like trying to deal with this incident of using a vehicle as a weapon.

QUESTION:

[inaudible]

PETER DUTTON:

The current threat level overall is PROBABLE, so that's concerning to us and as we know, as I  mentioned before, 81 people have been charged with terrorist-related offences over the  course of the last three years or so, but we've been able - as a Commonwealth and as State  police agencies with their involvement - been able to thwart about 14 incidents which  would have potentially resulted in loss of many, many Australians.

So we need to be mindful that as we have people radicalised online, young people in  particular who are listening to this propaganda online, we need to remind ourselves - and  people who are in a position of influence; leaders within communities, family members,  siblings, sons, daughters, parents - if that snippet of information is available, you can  anonymously provide that information to the police either through Crime Stoppers or  through the hotline on 1800 123 400 because if you do that, it may well result in lives being  saved and we would be very grateful for that information.

QUESTION:

Can you tell us what you know about the suspect, his background?

www. minister. homeaffairs. gov . au

PETER DUTTON:

We haven't got any further information to release in relation to him at the moment.  Obviously - as is already publicly available I think - he's an individual that arrived in  Australia under the refugee and humanitarian programme. So that was in 2004 as I recall. So  that's the information otherwise that's publicly available, but I can't add to that at the

moment.

QUESTION:

[inaudible] security bollards everywhere.

PETER DUTTON:

No it's not. The intelligence picture here is the most important thing. We need to make sure  that we're getting as much intelligence from the community. We need to make sure that the  police and the intelligence agencies have the right powers to collect that information, to  disseminate it as appropriate. All of the physical and built environment changes that need to  take place are in the process of taking place or have already been implemented. So there  are many elements to it.

Obviously there's a lot of proactive work that goes on by the Australian Federal Police, ASIO  and the State Police authorities as well. We have stood up Counter-Terrorism Unit officers  at our international airports and they're speaking to people both on their way out of  Australia as well as those returning. The intelligence gathering piece is as big as it's ever

been, but the threat is more significant than it's ever been as well.

I think it's important to put in perspective the fact that this was an isolated incident. There's  no indication that this was part of some broader cell or there is, you know, an impending  threat at the moment. That's not the information or the intelligence that we have.

I want people to be reassured as they go about their Christmas activities to know that the  police are working 24/7 to keep us all safe at the moment, and that work will continue of  course and if people have any information then please provide it to the police authorities.

QUESTION:

The second person arrested yesterday [inaudible].

PETER DUTTON:

Police now know through their investigations overnight that that individual wasn't  associated with the driver of the vehicle in question. So that person has been discounted.  He was in the vicinity at the time, but there's no connection as I am advised on the  information and intelligence currently available that there's any link to the driver or to the

www. minister. homeaffairs. gov . au

vehicle. He was at that point, in the wrong place at the wrong time, if you like, so he 's been

discounted from further investigation.

QUESTION:

Any advice for Aussies travelling abroad overseas during the holiday season? Are there any

risks or anything they should be looking out for and could it possibly be [inaudible].

PETER DUTTON:

Its  a good question. We know that a million people a year holiday in Indonesia, so many  peop les  Christmas will be going to Bali, they'll be going to other places in South-East Asia  and of course to Europe or right around the world. I mean Australians travel a lot.

All I would say to people is to take note of the information on the smartraveller website, on

the Department of Foreign Affairs website. To get any of that up-to-date country

information before you travel, to register and to make sure that you're watching constantly

the information that's being provided through the DEAT website.

But otherwise, if you 're in a tourist destination, if you 're at a bar within, you know, a village

in Bali or wherever it might be, just make sure that you are extra cautious, make sure that

you 're watching the surrounds, watching what is going on around you and be aware of the

environment that you 're in.

This is a difficult time, particularly in South-East Asia. We work very closely with the

Indonesian authorities, we work very closely with the Philippines Government and others

particularly in those two areas where we have had foreign fighters returning from Syria and

the Middle East. So there 's a lot of work that Defence and our intelligence and law

enforcement agencies are engaged in in the region. But please be aware, whether you're at

a shopping centre or elsewhere.

This was an isolated incident in Melbourne, but we know that there are people that would

seek to do us harm and at this time of year we do need to pay particular attention to the

surrounds whether we're here in Australia or whether people are intending to travel

overseas.

QUESTION:

Can I quickly ask you about the WA boat?

PETER DUTTON:

Yeah sure.

www. minister. homeaffairs.gov . au

QUESTION:

The drug bust. So, where did these people come from, where was the boat from?

PETER DUTTON:

The Australian Federal Police aren't releasing that detail at the moment in terms of where  the vessel's come from because it's still an active investigation, but we know that eight  people have been arrested in relation to this, both people off the vessel and also people  onshore.

So, we've been concerned for some time - and obviously there have been previous  incidents where drugs have been seized either by carriers or courier's onshore meeting  people on vessels - so all of that detail will be released in time.

We know that this is the biggest drug bust in our country's history of methamphetamine.  One point two tonnes is an incredible amount of drugs that won't hit our streets this  Christmas and New Year period and to take 12 million hits off the street over the Christmas  and New Year period is a huge success story.

So again I really want to pay tribute to the AFP, to the Western Australian Police, the  Australian Border Force, AUSTRAC, all of those other agencies that were involved. This is a  very, very successful culmination and it really reflects months of work going back to the  middle of the year and it's a credit great to all of those officers involved.

There are kids in Australia who will have their lives saved because of the impact that the  police have had in the detection of these drugs. Taking 12 million hits off the street over the  Christmas New Year period will make a big impact right across the country and this is the  biggest bust. It's a billion dollar bust and it's the biggest bust of amphetamine in our  country's history.

QUESTION:

Was it a public tip-off that led to this?

PETER DUTTON:

Again, not something we would comment on in terms of where the intelligence has come  from, but it is a long run investigation and there's still obviously a period to run in terms of  the police activity and the investigations in relation to this matter.

But again, it's been a successful operation and quite often these operations start off  because somebody close to a criminal, or somebody who has information, somebody that  overheard a telephone call has provided information to Crime Stoppers and again if  anybody has that sort of information, they really could make a big positive impact on the

lives of Australians if they provide that information.

www. minister. homeaffairs. gov . au

QUESTION:

Geraldton is a somewhat remote port, North WA. Is that a common place that you see  criminals avoiding those bigger city areas to try to get up to those smaller ones? Are they  secure?

PETER DUTTON:

Well we have certainly seen this in the past where - particularly on the West Australian  coast, but also across the Torres Strait as well where we're obviously in very close proximity  to Papua New Guinea and many movements of vessels across that Strait on a daily basis -  the reality is that Australian Border Force patrol areas regularly, the Queensland Police do,  the Northern Territory Police do and obviously the West Australian Police as well.

Lots of joint operations, but most of these operations that are successful are the result of  information being provided to the policing authorities. So again, if people have that  information please provide it.

QUESTION:

Were they all Australians that were arrested?

PETER DUTTON:

Look, I don't have that information in relation to the nationality, but the police will provide  that information in due course.

Thanks very much. Have a nice Christmas.
