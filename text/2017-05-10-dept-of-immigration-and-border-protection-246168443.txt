This statement provides an update on Operation Sovereign Borders (OSB) activities related to the on-water



reception and processing of illegal maritime arrivals.



The reporting period is from 1 April 2017 to 30 April 2017.



During this reporting period there were no illegal maritime arrivals transferred to Australian Immigration



authorities.



No illegal maritime arrivals were transferred to regional processing centres.



Four illegal maritime arrival detainees were voluntarily removed from Australia. Two illegal maritime arrival



detainees were involuntarily removed from Australia to their country of origin. Their removal from Australia is



consistent with Australia's obligations.



Eight illegal maritime arrival transferees voluntarily returned to their country of origin from a regional processing



country.



As at 30 April 2017, there was a total of 821 people in the Manus Regional Processing Centre (RPC) and 373



people in Nauru RPC. With the opening of the Manus RPC, those yet to be determined are permitted to depart



the RPC. The figure on those still living in the RPC will therefore be fluid.



Of the 1015 Refugee Status Initial Assessment Notifications at Manus, 510 were positive and 505 were negative



as at 30 April 2017. There were 711 refugees who have been given a positive final determination. There were



224 failed asylum seekers who have been given a negative final determination.



Of the 1209 Refugee Status Determination (RSD) hand downs in Nauru, 1034 were positive and 175 were



negative as at 30 April 2017.
