VISIONS OF AUSTRALIA Grant recipients-May 2002 17th grant round

AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY

Australian War Memorial 1918: Australians in France-focuses on the great courage and sacrifice shown by Australian men and women during the final year of the war on the Western Front.

The exhibition features stories of ordinary individuals who performed extraordinary acts in the face of adversity. There are first hand accounts and photographic images of Australians killed in action in the final battles of World War I. The exhibition will tour to Zeehan, Devonport, Castlemaine, Beechworth, Sunbury, Griffith and Huskisson. Touring Grant: $29,300

CSIRO-Australian National Wildlife Collection Foundation The Macquarie Bank Foundation Travelling Wildlife Display-will show the uniqueness of Australia's vertebrate wildlife and the importance of the Australian National Wildlife Collection and other natural history collections in documenting and helping to preserve that uniqueness. The exhibition will heighten public awareness of Australian biodiversity and the role of natural history collections in promoting biodiversity conservation. The exhibition will tour to Canberra, Mosman, Goodwood, West Perth, Walpole, Parkville, Shepparton, Dubbo, Brisbane, Atherton, Darwin and Alice Springs. Touring Grant: $57,300

National Library of Australia Between the Sheets: A Century of Australian Music -charts the rise and subsequent decline of Australian sheet music throughout the 20th century. Popular themes, a cast of personalities and evocative stories are portrayed through oral histories, video clips and exhibition objects and film screenings that comprise the exhibition.

This colourful exhibition, presented in association with ScreenSound Australia, provides an entertaining and informative overview of Australia's social and political history throughout the past century. ScreenSound Australia has developed the video, sound and oral history components of the exhibition. The exhibition will tour to Orange, Townsville, Wangaratta, Adelaide, Tamworth and Brisbane. Touring Grant: $45,000

NEW SOUTH WALES

Sydney Jewish Museum Crossroads: Shanghai and the Jews of China -explores themes of migration, flight and rescue. Crossroads deals with the Jewish history of Shanghai, focussing on the city as a haven for Jews during World War II. The exhibition pays tribute to the racial and ethnic tolerance of the Chinese towards Jewish refugees during this significant historical period.

Crossroads relates the story of Jewish communities in China immediately before, during and after WWII with particular focus on Shanghai and the migration of many of the survivors to Australia after 1946. Numbering over 25,000, Shanghai's Jewish community consisted of three distinct groups-each

with their own idenity-Oriental or Sephardic Jews, Russians Jews and Central European refugess from Nazism. Living in this exotic and cosmpolitan city they experienced a remakable degree of acceptance by the local Chinese population. The role that Shanghai played as a haven for Jewish refugees in this story has deep resonances for today.

To tell this fascinating and important story the exhibition draws on the private collections of those who migrated to Australia. The exhibition will tour to Bendigo, Dangar, Ararat, Cobar and Wollongong. Touring Grant: $99,000

Tamworth City Gallery 15th Tamworth Fibre Textile Biennial: Material Witness  In contemporary textiles practice there has been a resurgence in the desire to make objects, to use processes and materials in a way that investigates, transforms and enhances concepts to do with the body, architectural space, history (cultural, social and personal) and touch-often with surprising results. Artists often use the familiarity of textiles as a platform to present some challenging, provocative and subversive concepts to an unsuspecting audience. Material Witness refers to the desire to make objects and imbue them with personal, cultural, political or industrial meaning, evidenced through the material itself more than the illustration of an ideological stance. The exhibition will tour to Mornington, Brisbane, Campbelltown, Port Pirie, Murwillumbah, Perth and Launceston. Touring Grant: $66,000
