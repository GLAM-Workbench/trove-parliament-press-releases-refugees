PRIME MINISTER

TRANSCRIPT OK DOORSTOP, I3URDEK1N FALLS DAM, 14 AUGUST 1988

E & ÃÂ K - PROOF ONLY

JOURNALIST: On a separate issue Prime Minister. I've been asked from Canberra if you would make u comment on Mr  Spender's comments that we should open up trade links again  with South Africa and open up the airways.

PM: 1 completely repudiate those suggestions and I ’m very pleased to see that my predecessor as Prime Minister, Malcolm  Fraser, has today also strongly repudiated it. Like nearly  everything that the present Opposition is doing, it is  going against the stream, not only of thinking in this  country but around the world. There is an increasing

realisation that pressure must be increased upon South  Africa and that is being reflected, for instance in the  United States where the Congress there is passing legislation  to further lift the measure ol economic sanctions from

the United States. The regime In South Africa is being  affected by what is being done now. Let me give you a  statistic that in the six months since December of last  year. South Africa's reserves have fallen by 28 percent  There are now just in the last few weeks, calls from leading

business institutions and figures within South Africa including  a statement recently by Harry Oppenheimer that the South  African Government must realise that as a result of what  is being done around the world, in terms of pressure upon

South Africa, that the South African regime must move to  abolish apartheid. Now, at the very time when, as a result  of what is being done around the world, this is happening,  that the pressure is working, the leading business figures

and institutions in South Africa are saying that the regime  must abolish apartheid. It's precisely at that time, as  you would I've no doubt expect, that this Opposition and  its spokesman, Mr Spender, is saying 'Oh no, call off the

pressure'. It is, without any question, the worst Opposition  that this country has ever seen and with every passing  '  .day one spokesman after another is giving further proof  of that fact.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister .... words you allegedly made in 1977 on immigration

PM: Well, l mean everyone is just having a great laugh about that. Here is this poor fellow who is now under  increasing attack from within his own Party and ÃÂ *  m glad  to see that the Liberal Party is responding in the way

that. I believe that they would. The docent people in the

2 .

Liberal Party are responding and putting the pressure upon  him. His days, I believe, are numbered.  So what's he  done? He knows that if there is one person in Australian  politics who has not a taint of racism in him, it's Dob  Hawke. So, what's he done? He's looked through the record.  What's he come up with? That in 1977 when boat people  were landing on our shores, that I said 'well the country

just can't have a situation where you are just going to  have boat load after boat load landing on the shore*. A statement that 1 would have made whether it was Germans,  Americans, South Africans, Frenchmen, you would have simply

said you can't have a situation where people can just lob  in here in some unregulated process, just anyone dropping  in like that. It had nothing to do with race, colour or

anything like that. That 1977 statement he tries to use  as some sort of diversion. Well,  it won't work Mr Howard. It simply will not work because as every editorialist in  this country, including as well the comments of your own

people, they all know Mr Howard that you are the one which  has started something which hopefully will be brought to  an end, as I say, by the inner workings of the better force  within the Liberal Party. There is no hope for redemption

I think within the National Party, but within the Liberal  Party it is quite clear that the forces are building up  there to repudiate this unacceptable development that Mr  Howard has initiated and the hypocrisy of Mr Howard in  coming out and trying to reprimand, rebuke Mr Sinclair

just makes his performance t;he more pathetic. There was  one person who started this, it was John Howard and fortunately  it looks as though his own Party will finish the process  in the way it ought to be finished.
