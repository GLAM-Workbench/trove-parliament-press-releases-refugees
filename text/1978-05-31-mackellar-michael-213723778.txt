NSW SETTLEMENT CENTRES FOR MIGRANTS

New settlement centres for migrants would give most

newcomers the opportunity to undergo 6-12 weeks orientation

courses as soon as they arrived in Australia, the Minister

for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, the Hon. M.J.R. MacKellar,

said today.  '  Ã¢ÂÂ   .  .

Action was being taken to appoint staff to run the

centres, Mr MacKellar said.

The settlement centres - 11 based in migrant hostels

and five among communities where there are many newly-arrived

migrants - are part of the initial settlement program recommended

in the Galbally Report on Migrant Services and Programs.

- .

"The Galbally Report acknowledges that for this proposal

it used as a model the highly-successful orientation programs

that have been developed for refugees," Mr MacKellar said.

"I welcome the extension to cover the needs of all

migrants.  It is important that programs should cater for allÂ­

in need rather than for particular groups in a piecemeal

operation.

"These new steps meet the Government's determination

that every dollar spent will bring worthwhile results."

Mr MacKellar said the hostel settlement centres would

cater mainly for migrants, including refugees, without links

in Australia who needed orientation and settlement assistance

in a residential setting.

The community-based settlement centres would provide

services for those migrants w ho, while having families or.

sponsors here, wanted to participate in daily orientation

and settlement programs.  .

"Some people, of course, will need^longer periods for

adjustment than others," Mr MacKellar said. "But it is

important that all have the opportunity.

Ã¢ÂÂ   Â·  "We should remember that problems of adjustment to a

new life do not arise only for non-English speaking migrants.

Many who are more or less fluent in English can still find

much that is strange here." .

The new-style centres would provide:

. intensive English instruction for those who could

not speak the language; .

. talks and discussion groups about life in Australia;

. counselling and advice about, housing, employment,

recognition of professional, qualifications and

educational opportunities;

.  . visits to schools, banks, post offices, supermarkets

and similar community services; .

,. assistance with job interviews, moving in to the

community and other practical problems.

.  "An important feature of the new centres will be their ’

links with the community," Mr. MacKellar said. "This will

encourage learning about Australia by social contacts.

'  "The work of the centres will be linked and co-ordinated

with other services and programs for immigrants."
