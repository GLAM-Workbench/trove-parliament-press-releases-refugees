The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock, 
today announced tough new measur es aimed at curbing the growing 
number of people arriving illegally in Australia.

Â

He said key initiatives to be introduced included:

Â

Â· Â Excluding unauthorised arrivals from accessing permanent 
residence by giving genuine refugees a three-year temporary protection 
visa or a short-term safe haven visa.

Â

Â· Â Stopping people who have effective protection overseas from 
gaining onshore protection in Australia.

Â

Â· Â Using fingerprinting and other biometric tests such as DNA 
testing, face, palm or retinal recognition and voice testing to help 
ascertain the true identity of asylum seekers to ensure, where possible, 
they do not already have protection elsewhere or have been refused refugee 
status overseas.

Â

The Minister said Australia took its international obligations v ery 
seriously and was committed to providing protection to genuine refugees. 
He said the initiatives he had announced today would help ensure those 
in greatest need received Australia’s help.

Â

“Unauthorised arrivals by air have continued to 
grow at over 30 percent each year and boat arrivals have grown from 
200 people in 1998 to about 1,500 so far this year. Reliable reports 
indicate that up to 2,000 more unauthorised arrivals are believed to 
be in Indonesia waiting for vessels to bring them to Australia,” Mr 
Ruddock said.

Â

“Most of these people are from Iraq, Turkey and 
Afghanistan and many have been outside their country for decades. It 
is clear that most of these people are being trafficked to Australia 
by criminal elements.

Â

“In a growing trend that has become known as ‘forum 
shopping’, these people are trying to exploit Australia’s generous 
arrangements for refugees to gain residence in their country of preference.”

Â

Mr Ruddock said the proposed legislation would put 
an end to this abuse that undermines the refugee process and takes places 
from genuine applicants who are languishing in refugee camps around 
the world.

Â

The Minister said that the new identification powers 
would bring Australia closer into line with some European countries, 
Britain, and the USA, which are also considered attractive targets by 
forum shoppers.

Â

“For some time these countries have been strengthening 
their powers to fingerprint and otherwise identify asylum seekers and 
unauthorised arrivals by using new technologies, while our powers have 
remained unchanged for over 50 years,” Mr Ruddock said.

Â

“Australia simply cannot afford to be seen as a 
potential soft target by forum shoppers and the increasingly sophisticated 
people smuggling rackets.”

Â

Mr Ruddock said the temporary protection visa would 
also remove incentives to forum shoppers who might otherwise have considered 
Australia as their country of protection over closer and more logical 
alternatives.

Â

“The legislation will prevent unauthorised arrivals 
from obtaining permanent protection visas and the benefits, particularly 
family reunion, which appear to attract traffickers and forum shoppers,” 
the Minister said.

Â

“In addition, if they leave Australia, the temporary 
visa will cease and they will have no automatic right of return.”

Â

The Minister said he believed these initiatives would go a long way 
to solving the problem of forum shopping and removing the incentives 
for unauthorised arrivals.

Â

Mr Ruddock said these initiatives would be extensively publicised 
through Australia’s ove rseas posts as part of an overseas information 
campaign aimed at deterring would be illegal entrants.
