RUDDOCK CALLS FOR ALP SUPPORT ON PEOPLE SMUGGLING

Â

The Minister for immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock 
from China today and urged  the ALP to support every Government 
measure to curb the increase in illegal entrants coming to Australia.

Â

In the last two weeks there have been 6 boat arrivals 
carrying 717 unauthorised arrivals comprised of 513 Iraqis, 147 Afghanis 
and 57 other nationalities, along with 23 Indonesian crew.

Â

“I have written to the Prime Minister seeking to 
bring on debate on the Border Protection Bill, which includes measures 
to interdict and board vessels in international waters which we believe 
are involved in people smuggling. Debate on the Bill will be the first 
order of business when Parliament resumes on Monday 22 November.

Â

“I will be seeking ALP support for the urgent passage 
of amendments to that Bill which the Government will introduce when 
it reaches the Senate. These amendments will deal decisively with so-called 
forum-shopping”, the Minister said.

Â

The amendments will:

Â

Â

“The Government has been systematically introducing measures to 
stop illegals - in fact w e have done more than any other Government,” 
Mr. Ruddock said.

Â

“And we have had some success with these measures- 
most notably the reduction in the number of boat people from China.

Â

“The Government has also tasked key Departmental 
Secretaries to identify further measures that can be taken both internationally 
and domestically. They will report to Cabinet as a matter of priority,

Â

“This will supplement the work currently underway 
by the External Reference Group comprising former Labor Immigration 
Minister, Gerry Hand, former Liberal Immigration Minister John Hodges 
and former Chief of the Air Force Ray Funnell.” the Minister said.

Â

"It is timely to remember that the use of people 
smugglers to get around a country’s rules about who can come and who 
can stay is a world-wide problem.

Â

Australia is not alone.

Â

“We are also seeing large numbers of people seeking 
asylum in developed countries - people from the same groups as we are 
seeing in Australia.

Â

“For example, Iraqi asylum-seekers are registered 
in 77 countries and last year there were over 34.000 applications for 
asylum lodged by Iraqis in 19 European countries.

Â

“The Government’s new regulation to limit protection to a three 
year temporary permit in the first instance, appears to be hitting the 
mark. When  recent arrivals were advised of the new temporary 
residence arrangements, they were upset that they weren’t getting 
the permanent residency pack age and immediate family reunion promised 
by the people smugglers.

Â

‘I understand that at least one person has indicated 
that he would prefer to leave Australia and shop for a better package 
elsewhere,” the Minister said.

Â

“The government’s initiatives are a comprehensive 
plan to equip Australia to deal effectively with this inflow of people 
from the Middle East and elsewhere. We need to move forward quickly 
and I urge the ALP and the Democrats to give us every support”.
