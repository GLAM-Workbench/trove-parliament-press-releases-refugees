Â

The killing must stop now!

Â

Federal member for the Northern Territory, Warren Snowdon, said today 
he had received information this morning confi rming that East 
Timorese refugees were still being executed in and around Kupang, Kefamenanu 
and Atambau in West Tumor.

Â

“The killings must stop and they must stop right 
now,” Mr Snowdon said.

Â

“The Indonesian leadership must know that they will 
be held to account for this,

Â

“Let there be no doubt that the international community 
will hold Indonesia responsible for any human rights transgressions 
that occur between now and the time peacekeeping forces are able to 
enter Timor.

Â

“The world community should not allow the Indonesian 
military to think that they can accept the need for international assistance 
to bring about peace and order in East Timor while they continue their 
campaign of murder and intimidation, and their violation of basic human 
rights.

Â

“it is clear that the Indonesian armed forces, the 
TNI, have been responsible for coordinating the events that have occurred 
over the past ten days and that they continue to be responsible for 
what is happening on the ground in both East and West Timor.

Â

“This morning we have been advised that in the camps 
around Atambau people are dying of thirst, hunger and disease and apparently 
malaria is out of control.

Â

“People are contacting us from these areas pleading 
for relief to come quickly. Their families here are telling me they 
are willing to charter aircraft to lift them out, and are themselves 
pleading for the authorities to clear the way for this to happen as 
a matter of priority,” Mr Snowdon said.

Â

On Sunday night Indonesian President Habibie said:

Â

“We canno  t wait any longer  1  we have to stop the suffering...too 
many people have lost their lives."

Â

‘These are fine words. However, they are hollow if there is no action 
and if President Habibie doesn’t direct the military to immediately 
stop the wanton killing an d other human rights violations, and 
guarantee security for humanitarian relief efforts throughout Timor.

Â

“What have John Howard, Alexander Downer and John 
Moore done about this problem? What assurance did they get from President 
Habibie, Foreign Minister Alatas and General Wiranto? The answer is 
obvious.

Â

“The Government should forget the back-slapping 
and self-congratulations because a peacekeeping force has been belatedly 
accepted. Far from this being a great victory, the whole saga has been 
a policy disaster and many people have died and more will die as a result,” 
Mr Snowdon said.
