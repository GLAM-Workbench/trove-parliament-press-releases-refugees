ALAN CADMAN M.P.   SHADOW MINISTER FOR   IMMIGRATION & ETHNIC   AFFAIRS

IMMIGRATION SYSTEM HAS COLLAPSED

"There was a massive 66% increase in the number of immigration   cases not finalsised in the 1985/86 immigration program.

"The system is grinding down with increasing delays in processing   applications despite Government promises that the system would   become more efficient.

"The fact is that after four years of Labor, immigration _   administration is" a shambles. ÃÂ

"The Government has failed to meet its promise that a major   feature of the 1985/86 immigration program would be simpler and   faster processing of applications," Alan Cadman M.P., Shadow   Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs,  said today.

"The Government has also claimed success for its policy.

"The rhetoric does not match the facts:
