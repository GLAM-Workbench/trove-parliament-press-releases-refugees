Transcript, E&OE

25 July 2011

KIERAN GILBERT: With me this morning now, Labor front bencher Richard Marles and  the Liberal MP Jamie Briggs.

Gentlemen, great to see you both.

Why don't we start, before we get into the politics, on that huge achievement over the  weekend, in fact over the last few weeks and for him decades Cadel Evans.

Richard Marles, winning the Tour de France, where does this achievement sit in the annals of  Australian sport in your view?

RICHARD MARLES: It's an interesting question and one that’s been asked over the last 24  hours.

I certainly think this is one of the great ornaments of world sport and an ornament that an  Australian has never won before.

To my mind this is bigger than winning Wimbledon or winning the British Open.

Of course we claim him as a home town boy in Geelong.

His Australian residence is within the City of Greater Geelong and when I went to buy the  Geelong Advertiser this morning its front cover was a sea of yellow. So it's a very exciting  day.

KIERAN GILBERT: Indeed it is, Jamie you're a sports lover like Richard and myself. You  would have watched many hours of this over the last few days and weeks. It was just such a  tenacious effort. Where do you have it, up with the likes of Cathy Freeman, Dawn Fraser,  where is it in terms of, for you, in Australian sporting achievements?

JAMIE BRIGGS: Well I don't think you can compare. I mean this is a sport unique to itself.  I mean it's quite an amazing effort really, you think about the amount of kilometres that  they've ridden in the last few weeks and the injuries and pain that he's gone through. We have

the Tour Down Under, which is in Australia, which is in my electorate and you see the effort  that these guys put in over just five days; this is some 20 days and I think he's — it will sit up  there.

There's a great cartoon in the Advertiser, the Adelaide Advertiser today, not the Geelong  Advertiser which has got the bar with some of our greats, whether it be Bradman or Freeman  or now Cadel Evans and it is clearly up there with Australia's finest sporting hours.

KIERAN GILBERT: Yeah, absolutely tremendous and congratulations to him from all of  us.

Richard Marles onto the Newspoll, some glimmer of hope, it seems for Labor it might have  bottomed out the numbers and up in the carbon tax, do you take a bit of hope from that?

RICHARD MARLES: Putting a price on carbon has never been about polls, that's been very  clear. This is about doing what's right for Australia's future. We need to build an economy  where growth is not coupled with a corresponding growth in carbon emissions. If we don't do  that, we won't have a vibrant economy in the future. And what we've done, by putting a price  on carbon, means we can look forward to the long-term prospect of a vibrant economy with  long-terms jobs. That's why we've done it, it's not about polls.

We've also known this is difficult policy and one which is going to take time to explain.  We've done that in the face of an enormous scare campaign on the part of the Opposition.  But, we are confident that given the time and opportunity to explain its effect and why we  need to do what we're doing, Australians ultimately will see the wisdom of this and will  support it.

KIERAN GILBERT: Jamie, obviously no concern yet for the Coalition, you're still daylight  between the Coalition and Labor at this point and certainly on the carbon tax while 53 per  cent oppose it, but does it show Labor's votes bottomed out here?

JAMIE BRIGGS: Well, look, we don't oppose it because of polls, we oppose it because it's  bad policy. And I note that the front page of the Fin Review today highlights that Julia  Gillard, in a memo she wrote for the Gang of Four Plus One, just last year, said exactly the  same thing, that a better approach to addressing the challenge of climate change was to adopt  a bipartisan agreement with the Leader of the Opposition and take on the direct action policy.  So when Julia Gillard wrote privately to the former prime minister and Lindsay Tanner and  Wayne Swan and Penny Wong last year, as reported in the Fin Review today, she said direct  action was a better way to go.

So this gets to the fundamental point about this prime minister, you cannot trust her. She sat  in front of a TV camera just before the last election and said there would be no carbon tax

under the government she led, afterwards she announced there would be and it gets to, who is  running this country. Is it Bob Brown or is it Julia Gillard? And all indications are, if Julia  Gillard was writing this to the Gang of Four Plus One last year, it must be Bob Brown who's  decided that carbon tax is the best way to go.

KIERAN GILBERT: Last week, Richard- you can respond to Jamie as well on that point  about Julia Gillard and whether or not her commitment has been questioned, not just by the  Opposition but by the electorate over recent months — but you were at the United Nations  last week unable to get a concerted commitment by the UN to put  climate change as a  priority. That shows how difficult it is doesn't it, for the international community to get some  momentum there?

RICHARD MARLES: Just in terms of responding to Jamie's points, we should be very clear  that this has been Labor policy for a very long time and we have dedicated a lot of political  energy since being elected in 2007 to try and put a price on carbon. We've been pretty  consistent about that and we've done that in the face of the Greens fighting against this in the  last Parliament. So, I don't think there's any doubt about where this policy comes from. This  is a Labor initiative…

JAMIE BRIGGS: How do you explain a memo?

RICHARD MARLES: This is a Labor initiative and I think one thing: it would have been  preferable to have been doing this as a bipartisan piece with the Opposition. That's what we  were trying to do in the last Parliament. But, under the leadership of Tony Abbott, we've got

the most obstructionist Opposition you could imagine and one which has its head completely  in the sand about the need for us to adopt a price on carbon and  move towards a modern  economy.

But Kieran, on your point about the United Nations, I think we just need to be a little careful  here. The UN is very seized of this issue. The UN Framework Convention on Climate  Change has been the principle mechanism for dealing with this and that has taken up huge  resources from the UN.

The debate I was participating in was a debate within the Security Council and was looking at  the UNSC being involved in the security aspects of this debate.

This is something about which there are differing opinions in the world.

But, the debate  happened in the Security Council and, for the first time, we did see a  presidential statement out of the Security Council on this issue.

Across the broad scope of the UN system, there's no doubt about the priority put on it and the  international momentum there is for change and the need to change on this issue.

KIERAN GILBERT: Okay. Jamie, Malcolm Turnbull urged Conservatives not to discard  the science, to embrace the science. He renewed that call in the last couple of days. What did  you make of his comments? Do people read too much into it, some of your colleagues who  were critical of him?

JAMIE BRIGGS: Well Malcolm re-stated the party policy and we believe that we should be  taking action. We've had a policy about this from before the election. We took that policy to  the election and it remains our policy today.

I noted Richard mentioned inconsistency, well that's an interesting line to use given that Julia  Gillard, of course, was the person who forced Kevin Rudd to dump his ETS. We now know  she wrote a memo, which Richard didn't touch on once in his answer, to the Gang of Four  Plus One saying that we shouldn't have an ETS, we should have direct action. And before the  election she told the Australian public that she wouldn't have a carbon tax under a  government she led.

She's been far from inconsistent on this policy issue and that's why the Australian people do  not trust her with a policy that will do no economic — it will do no environmental good, it  will do economic harm and it will go further than what's been announced. There's one thing  — nothing surer than what the Labor Party when they get a new tax will want the revenue.

KIERAN GILBERT: Okay, let's talk about…

RICHARD MARLES: [Indistinct]…

KIERAN GILBERT: Well just quickly Richard, I want to look at the Malaysia…

RICHARD MARLES: Well can I just say…

KIERAN GILBERT: …deal to be signed today, yep.

RICHARD MARLES: We have been pursuing a price on carbon since before the 2007  election and sometimes we're doing it with an Opposition who wants to work with us, under  Malcolm Turnbull, and sometimes we're doing it with an Opposition under Tony Abbott…

JAMIE BRIGGS: So why did she write the memo?

RICHARD MARLES: …who is as obstructionist as you come.

JAMIE BRIGGS: So why did she write the memo?

RICHARD MARLES: There can be no — there can be no doubt…

JAMIE BRIGGS: Why did she write the memo?

RICHARD MARLES: …about the consistency of the position that we have taken in relation  to this.

JAMIE BRIGGS: [Laughs]

RICHARD MARLES: We're about putting a price on carbon. We always have been.

KIERAN GILBERT: On the Malaysia deal…

JAMIE BRIGGS: Why did she write the memo?

KIERAN GILBERT: …to be signed today, Richard, the government will obviously want to  get this message out far and wide, that the deal after a couple of months, has finally been  signed. Apparently, the 550 or so asylum seekers that have arrived in the last couple of  months were unaware that the deal had been done.

RICHARD MARLES: Chris Bowen has been doing fantastic work in his relationship with  the Malaysian Government and, when this ultimately comes to be, this will be an important  step forward in breaking the model of people smuggling. It really is going to make a  difference. In fact, even the prospect of it has seen a drop in the number of people coming to  Australia via boats.

This is one which is balanced, which provides a good humanitarian outcome, which will see  the number of refugees that Australia takes through the proper channels increase and which  guarantees the human rights of those asylum seekers returning to Malaysia. It does this in a  way which will break the people smuggling model and that is what, I think, Australians want  to see and it's an important step forward.

KIERAN GILBERT: Five hundred and seventy asylum seekers that have arrived though  Richard, will remain in limbo won't they, because you haven't secured a deal with a third  country and the Solomon Islands have offered their support, why not take that up?

RICHARD MARLES: We've been focusing on our negotiations with Malaysia and with  Papua New Guinea and we continue to work with both countries. These are complicated  deals to work through and, of course, in the case of PNG specifically, they've obviously had  real issues at home with the health of Sir Michael Somare. But we're working with them and  that's where we are focused, in answer to the question about the Solomon Islands.

But in relation to the 500-odd that you…

KIERAN GILBERT: Will PNG be done soon? Will that deal be done sooner rather than  later?

RICHARD MARLES: The short answer to that is it will happen when it happens Kieran.  We are working this through with PNG and I'm not about to put a timeframe on it. We are  working closely with them and they have obviously demonstrated an interest in pursuing  these negotiations. As I say, when there is something to announce, we'll announce it.

But, in relation to those 500-odd that you mentioned, who have come to Christmas Island  since the 7 May, we have made it clear that it should not be assumed that they will be  processed in Australia and I'm sure that the minister will have more to say on their situation  in the weeks to come.

KIERAN GILBERT: Jamie Briggs, this does look like it's already had some impact. The  government argues it's slowed the flow of boats. If it does achieve that, you'd welcome it  wouldn't you?

JAMIE BRIGGS: Well I'm looking forward to the Dear John and Dear Philip letters that the  Labor Party are about to write, because after all the years of abuse that they threw at John  Howard and Philip Ruddock, claiming that they were some sort of version of Nazis in the  way that they treated people, that they abused human rights — I mean, you know, in the last

few weeks we've had all this great outrage about Julia Gillard being called a liar; I remember  where we used to arrive at functions with the former prime minister and the Labor Party and  its supporters used to throw eggs and hurl abuse on this issue.

Now we have the Labor Party signing up, to a country that has not signed up to the UNHCR  arrangements, doing a one-off deal, because of a mess that they created. This is complete and  utter hypocrisy and I wonder where Melissa Parke, that famous UN lawyer, you know, from  the left of the Labor Party, where they all are today. They'll be in hiding in the shame that  they live in, that they're now part of a party who is, you know — apparently Nauru was too  bad a place to send people to, yet now we've got a deal, we presume will be announced today  by Chris Bowen, with Malaysia.

Give me a break. I mean, I just can't wait to see the letter, signed by all the members of  parliamentary Labor Party, apologising to John Howard and Philip Ruddock for all the abuse  that they threw at them over the last 10 years.

RICHARD MARLES: Well I think we do need…

KIERAN GILBERT: Okay. Richard — just 30 seconds Richard, we're almost out — yeah?

RICHARD MARLES: Well I don't think anyone used the language that Jamie suggested  was used…

JAMIE BRIGGS: Oh, really?

RICHARD MARLES: …firstly, there.

JAMIE BRIGGS: Really? [Laughs]

RICHARD MARLES: Well, I don't think anyone talked in term of Nazis. But the important  point…

JAMIE BRIGGS: Oh, yeah, really? You want to…

RICHARD MARLES: …to make is that this is something…

JAMIE BRIGGS: …you want to bet. [Laughs]

RICHARD MARLES: …this is something now being done, in concert with the UNHCR  and the International Organisation for Migration, that is not what the Howard Government  did.

JAMIE BRIGGS: Oh, that is absolute…

RICHARD MARLES: There is a huge difference in that.

JAMIE BRIGGS: …hypocrisy Richard.

RICHARD MARLES: And to suggest it's a fig leaf…

JAMIE BRIGGS: Absolute hypocrisy.

RICHARD MARLES: ….which Scott Morrison did is ridiculous.

KIERAN GILBERT: All right, gentlemen…

JAMIE BRIGGS: It is absolute hypocrisy.

KIERAN GILBERT: …unfortunately we're out of time. Jamie, I think we got your point  too, mate, appreciate that this morning…

JAMIE BRIGGS: [Laughs]

KIERAN GILBERT: …gentlemen. Have a good day and we'll chat to you soon. That's all  for AM Agenda.
