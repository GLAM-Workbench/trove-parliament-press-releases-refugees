E&OE……………………….…………………………………………………………………

LISA WILKINSON:

Joining us to discuss his Kevin problem is Opposition Leader Tony Abbott. Good morning to you Mr Abbott.

TONY ABBOTT:

Good morning Lisa.

LISA WILKINSON:

You do seem to have a bit of a problem on your hands with Kevin Rudd, don’t you?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, there has been a change. No doubt about that. It is a change of style, not a change of substance. I think that people will  soon realise that it is the same old Mr Rudd. The same old Labor. Yesterday, sure he brought forward by 12 months the move to

an emissions trading scheme but it is still a tax. It still hurts and it will still go up and up and up.

LISA WILKINSON:

We will get to that in just a moment but I want you to look at the screen behind you. This is where the two party preferred vote was  a month ago according to Nielsen, Newspoll was exactly the same. This is where it is today again the same polls, the same as

Newspoll, the same as Nielsen - that 50-50 issue. Are you rattled by that?

TONY ABBOTT:

Lisa, we always thought that the polls would tighten. I have always said that winning from opposition is like climbing Mount

Everest. Nothing worthwhile comes easily. The Australian people expect people to fight for the government of this country. I have  always known that I'm in a fight of my life.

LISA WILKINSON:

But you would have to say that this has come very easily to Kevin Rudd. Why do you think Australian voters have responded so

favourably so quickly to him?

TONY ABBOTT:

This is the big question, isn’t it? My instinct is what they are really doing is showing their relief at the departure of an unpopular  Prime Minister. We are a fair-minded people. We are prepared to give someone a fair go but I think what you will discover is that

he is the same old Kevin Rudd and conclude that he had his chance before and he blew it.

LISA WILKINSON:

As I mentioned Labor have been throwing out Julia Gillard's policies. The carbon tax is gone. Something you have called for three  years.

TONY ABBOTT:

But it hasn’t gone, Lisa.

LISA WILKINSON:

Well, it is moving to an emissions trading scheme.

TONY ABBOTT:

Whether it’s a fixed tax or a floating tax, it is still a tax, it still hurts and it will still go up.

LISA WILKINSON:

But you and John Howard both looked at an emissions trading scheme when you were in government back in 2006. So, you  thought it was a good idea at that time.

TONY ABBOTT:

And the more we looked at it, the worse it seemed. What happened in Copenhagen back in 2009 was the world decisively

rejected emissions trading schemes, carbon taxes, whether fixed or floating.

LISA WILKINSON:

Labor says that this change will take an annual $2,000 electricity bill down by $150. How much will electricity bills come down  under your scheme?

TONY ABBOTT:

The interesting thing Lisa is what Mr Rudd did yesterday was vindicate everything that we had been saying about the carbon tax.

LISA WILKINSON:

You should be happy about that?

TONY ABBOTT:

Lisa, he was saying that the carbon tax was good until yesterday. Now he admits that the carbon tax is bad. Now, if it was bad at  $23 a tonne, it is still bad at $10 a tonne. It is going to be even worse at $38 a tonne which he still thinks it will be in 2020. The

best thing to do is to get rid of it altogether. Mr Rudd vindicated everything we have been saying about the carbon tax.

LISA WILKINSON:

Kevin Rudd has said that he is moving to an ETS. You want to get rid of everything. Christine Milne said yesterday this could all  be pie-in-the-sky because once one of you forms a government she is going to block any change to this in the Parliament.

TONY ABBOTT:

The fact is, if you vote for Mr Rudd, you'll keep the carbon tax. He won’t admit it but you will keep the carbon tax under Kevin

Rudd. If you vote for the Coalition, the carbon tax is gone, lock stock and barrel. Not rebadged, not renamed but abolished.

LISA WILKINSON:

How can you guarantee that if Christine Milne isn’t on side? The Greens will have some power in parliament, both houses of  parliament.

TONY ABBOTT:

The Labor Party, if they lose an election which is a referendum on the carbon tax, is hardly going to want to commit political

suicide twice. If they lose this election, they won’t stick with the carbon tax.

LISA WILKINSON:

Looking at that 50-50 two-party preferred as it sits, we know that we are close to an election we just don't know when, do you  categorically rule out - should it once again come to a hung parliament - categorically rule out forming any alliance with any other

party or a group of independents?

TONY ABBOTT:

I don't do deals, Lisa.

LISA WILKINSON:

But you did say to Tony Windsor that you would do anything.

TONY ABBOTT:

Oh come on you don't believe that.

LISA WILKINSON:

Well, Tony Windsor said that you said you would do anything in order to be able to form a government at the last election.

TONY ABBOTT:

Tony Windsor changed his tune. First of all he said that I hadn’t wanted it enough and then he made the most outrageous and

scatological claims.

LISA WILKINSON:

So do rule it out?

TONY ABBOTT:

I don’t do deals. I do rule it out. The problem with voting Labor is that we could well end up with another hung parliament. The  problem with voting for minor parties and independents is that we could well end up with another hung parliament. I think that the

Australian people are sick of hung parliaments. We should not take the risk. The only way to have a strong and decisive  government, the only way to end the circus of the last three years, the last six years because it was a circus under Mr Rudd, it has

been a circus under Ms Gillard, is to vote for the Coalition.

LISA WILKINSON:

Another big issue leading into this election is the asylum seeker issue. As we saw on the weekend, another boat, another child  and eight people missing.

TONY ABBOTT:

It is awful, Lisa.

LISA WILKINSON:

It is, absolutely it is.

TONY ABBOTT:

And it will just get worse under Mr Rudd. He started it. He can’t fix it.

LISA WILKINSON:

You have said that you will stop the boats but we still don't know how you're going to do that.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well you do because I have told people time and time again that we will put back in place the policies that worked under the  former Coalition government.

LISA WILKINSON:

But the push factors have changed Mr Abbott. The asylum seeker problem around the world has gone up exponentially.

TONY ABBOTT:

Wrong, Lisa.

LISA WILKINSON:

The people smuggler systems are much more sophisticated than they were back in 2001/2002.

TONY ABBOTT:

It is not push factors. It is pull factors. It is the sugar on the table. Mr Rudd put it there. Sure the systems are more sophisticated in  Indonesia. Absolutely right. That is because Mr Rudd has turned out to be the best friend that the people smugglers have ever

had. He put them back in business. John Howard put them out of business. He put them back in business.

LISA WILKINSON:

But Indonesia’s President says that he will not accept boats being turned around. Aren’t you putting our service men and women  at risk?

TONY ABBOTT:

That is not actually what President Yudhoyono has said Lisa. Please don’t verbal President Yudhoyono.

LISA WILKINSON:

But you haven’t spoken to him, you gad the opportunity to speak to him.

TONY ABBOTT:

I have spoken to him three times and we have had a good discussion.

LISA WILKINSON:

So what is your plan?

TONY ABBOTT:

My plan is to do what is necessary to stop the boats. We are not going to be played for mugs by people smugglers. A serious  country does not allow itself to be taken for a ride by people like this. We will be prepared to turn boats around where it is safe to

do so. Let’s not forget Lisa, these boats are Indonesian flagged, Indonesian home ported, Indonesian crewed. They have a right  to return.

LISA WILKINSON:

Alright, Mr Abbott, we have to leave it there. We look forward to speaking with you again leading up to the election.

TONY ABBOTT:

I look forward to it as well, Lisa.
