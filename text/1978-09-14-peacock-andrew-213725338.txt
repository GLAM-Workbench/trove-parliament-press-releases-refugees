ROY MILNE MEMORIAL LECTURE

AUSTRALIA AND THE THIRD WORLD

Following is the full text of the address by' the  Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Andrew Peacock, to the' '   Institute of International Affairs in Perth on 15 September.

1978 ROY MILNE MEMORIAL LECTURE

PART I - THE THIRD WORLD

It is a pleasure to be in Perth tonight to deliver  the annual Roy Milne Memorial Lecture= Since its inception  this lecture has made a distinctive contribution to public  discussion of international affairs. From the opportunities

I have had to speak to your branches in other states I know  that the subject of Australia's relations with the Third World  is of particular interest to your members.

You will be aware,that the Government has set up a  high level committeeÂ»  with its secretariat in my Department,   to conduct an inquiry into Australia's relations with the  Third World. The inquiry is well in hand and-IT expect to 1   receive a report early next year.

Therefore, what I say tonight should not be regarded as  a sneak preview of the Committee's findings; nor would I want  you to treat my address as a definitive Government view of the  Third World. Rather,  I intend to canvass some of my own views

about the Third World and its significance for Australia.

As I will be covering a lot of ground I have divided  my address into two parts. The first section analyses the ;   Third World,  its values and beliefs and its impact.

-  In the second part I discuss Australia's relations with the Third World with an emphasis on Australia's regional  perspective of the Third World,  particularly our relationships  with South East Asia.

THE CONCEPT OF THE THIRD WORLD

X

For some years now I have sought to develop the theme  that our perception of Australia 1s external environment must .   take account of the fact that the world is rapidly changing. The dimensions of this change cannot be predicted accurately  but the character of international relations will be very  different in the future. The group of countries which we know

as the Third World is a significant agent in this process. In  many ways,  the future of these countries is what change is about

The term "the third world" had its origins in the  cold-war environment of the 1950s and distinguished the  Afro-Asian group from the countries aligned with the United  States or the Soviet Union.

The term is now applied generally to the newlyÃ¢ÂÂ¢  independent countries of Africa, the Asian/Pacific region and  the Middle East,  some older countries in these regions and the  countries of Latin America, in all. approximately 120 countries.  Third World countries have several shared characteristics;  anti-colonialism, non-alignment,  and economic under-development =  These factors help to unite the Third World . '

2.

Anti-colonialism has been a powerful,force,  and is  a source of strong emotional unity and shared assumptions.

While not all Third World countries are non-aligned  this has also been a mark of a Third World state. Despite the  fact that non-alignment means different things to various  countries,  the Non-aligned Movement has shown considerable "  capacity to adapt to changing circumstancesÃ¢ÂÂ.

A further general characteristic of Third World  countries is the fact of economic under-development. Those "  members of it which are rich - and it includes some of the ,   countries with the highest per capita incomes in the world -

owe their wealth to the possession of key raw materials. Those of them which have developed some sophisticated industrial  capacity still have a comparatively low standard of living.

The Third World is not,  of course,  a sharply  defined group. All states have their own interests and adapt  their behaviour to the arena in which they are operating.

THE DIVERSITY"OF THE THIRD WORLD .

In using the notion of the Third World I am not  implying a uniformity in the conditions of member states. Whether it is a question of race,  culture or political and  economic conditions the differences are striking.

In economic terms Third World countries fall into  several groups at different stages of development. The first  would include those countries which have very high national  incomes based on major raw material resources. The OPEC

countries are the main example of this group. A second group  would include those countries which have developed a competitive  manufacturing sector and which are experiencing rapid industrial  growth. This group would include important countries in Latin  America and East Asia. A third group covers those countries  which, though they possess resources and have the capacity to  develop, ha\/e not yet done so. Finally there is a group of

countries, and unfortunately there is a large number of them,  which are the real "have nots1. They have neither resources  nor industry but depend greatly on international assistance.

Although the Third World countries share many common  aspirations they are strongly nationalist. This nationalism  can also be a source of rivalry and dispute, in some cases open  conflict, between some neighbouring Third World states. In  their pursuit of national objectives they have much in common  with the nations of the First and Second Worlds,  despite their

rejection of what they characterise as the self-interest of the  developed countries. The adoption of practical nationalism  and their constant effort to improve their national situation  involves them directly in the conventional system of international!  diplomacy.

THIRD WORLD ATTITUDES

By attempting to understand the shared beliefs and  values on which their demands are based we can begin to  understand why the Third World has maintained,its solidarity  in the face of the often conflicting and competing interests  of its members. .

The Third World seeks structural change = -  A radical'  re-ordering of the present framework - both economically,   politically and militarily, Their economic proposals are  subsumed in various calls for a New International Economic ’

Order, Politically they emphasise the central importance of  the United Nations as an alternative to an international  system based on power politics, They justify the system they  propose on the grounds of egalitarianism, democracy and justice.

Of course it would be a system in which Third World countries  could use their numerical superiority to the greatest advantage.

They portray the wealth and power of the Western  world as the result of’  exploitation of the Third World and  regard Third World poverty as the consequence of Western  prosperity. They argue that exploitation did not stop with

the end of formal colonial ties and their independence. On  the contrary, they see it continuing as 1  neo-colonialism1   where dominance is in direct or disguised forms, Â·

The poverty, backwardness and weakness of the Third  World are, therefore, explainedÃ¢ÂÂin terms of an international  system which, because it works to the advantage of the developed  countries, must work against Third World .  interests,. The r-rules'of the

international trading, financial and legal systems are all seen  to be laid down by the Western industrial powers to suit their  interests.

The Third World belief that economic and military  power were the primary source of the West1s past supremacy  accounts in large part for their emphasis upon industrialisation  to reduce the development gap and upon disarmament to reduce the  military dominance of the developed countries.

Their belief in past and present 1  exploitation1  gives  rise to a strong moral component in Third World demands. Change is demanded as a moral right - on grounds of natural  justice and equality and as compensation for alleged wrongs.

To state these arguments is not to say that I agree,  but the perspective I have outlined is necessary to explain and  understand, both the specific issues chosen by the Third World  and their solidarity when action,  such as the OPEC oil price

rise, hurt many developing countries more than the industrialised  countries. ’

4 .

THIRD WORLD OBJECTIVES

Let me now summarise what I see as the principal .   objectives of the Third World countries.

Equality ofÂ· status and respect is an important Third  World objective. This involves acceptance of Third World "   countries as full,  equal and independent members of the world  community. They seek a greater share of power in line with their  human and material resources. They are attempting to redefine

the rules of international relations in ways that will enhance  the importance of those sources of power available to them.

They see greater independence resulting from economic  development and industrialisation. They want the distribution  of the world's financial and technological resources to be in  their favour.

The Third World also seeks an end to all racial  discrimination and exploitation by Europeans,  whether it is  practised in colonial situations or in domestic politics,  as  in Southern Africa.

THE IMPACT OF THE THIRD WORLD

In this short analysis of the Third World I have had  to compress the historical perspective. Many of the issues  have been characteristic of Third World attitudes since the _ process of decolonisation began after the second World War.

In the early post-war years the Third World countries  were preoccupied with nationalism and anti-colonialism. Their  capacity to influence international developments was limited  by their own weakness.

In recent years,  however,  the political significance  and influence of the Third World has increased substantially. The Third World countries have been able- to use cohesive  organisation and some economic advantages to gain greater  political influence.

The United States and the Soviet Union are no longOr  able to concentrate the agenda of international politics on  issues of bilateral interest to them. While their economic  and military power are no less real,  their ability to translate  this power into direct influence over events and the actions  of Other nations is now more complex and uncertain.

The international situation is now more flexible. .   Smaller states can have relations with both the super-powers.  There is less need for alignment. ,  Ã¢ÂÂ They have more room for manoeuvre and new opportunities for astute diplomacy.

It was in this context that OPEC's action in  quadrupling the price of oil in a very short time assumed ,   considerable symbolic importance in the Third Worlds It '   showed how it could increase their influence and demonstrated

in a dramatic fashion what could be achieved through united  and determined action= The oil weapon and the associated '   concept of commodity power came to be regarded as a major . asset in the Third World's bargaining position with the West,

The timing of GPEC1s action was crucial. It occurred  at a time of uncertainty and political and economic readjustment  in the West. In these circumstances the Western countries -reacted sharply to the potential threat to their economic

security from the use of commodity power as well as from the  inflow of cheap manufactures from developing countries=

Calmer counsels, however, prevailed. After the first  flush of triumph following OPEC's action many Ifeird World  countries became aware that oil was in many ways a special case.  It was recognised that the Third World1s commodity power was

rather limited. Though sensitive the West was not as vulnerable  as it was first thought. Third World tactics then switched  from an emphasis upon confrontation to the more practical  technique of collective bargaining. The possibility of confrontÂ­ ation has been reduced further, by the process of negotiation.

Notwithstanding this trend away from confrontation,  we need to recognise that Third World arguments are based on  judgments which proceed from different moral premises. Unless  we understand this the North/South dialogue will continue to

contain the seeds of confrontation. It may become an elaborate  exercise in misunderstanding, with each side talking about  different things. '

THIRD WORLD GAINS

.  The Third World has become a cohesive and confident  international presence. It has made effective use of the  sometimes limited political resources available to it. Its  influence is most noticeable in the United Nations system but  it also has had an impact in other international institutions,  including the Commonwealth.

The Third World has succeeded in establishing the  issues which concern it at the top of the agenda of international  politics. The increasing prominence of these issues and theirÂ·   discussion in Third World language, has been an important

achievement.

6.

However,  the present emphasis upon economic issues  and relationships in no way diminishes the importance of power  politics and the security concerns of the super-powers. I  have already pointed to the inter-relationship between the

economic objectives of the Third World countries and their  broader political objectives. These in turn are closely linked  to the concerns of the great powers. In this context Soviet  intentions and the extension of Soviet power are of fundamental

concern. This is particularly true of Africa where an exceedingly  difficult and complex situation is being further disturbed by  Soviet activities.

Far from being obsolete, therefore, power politics is,  as it always has been, Central to international relations. Despite their rhetorical disavowal of power politics, it is  recognised by the Third World as an enduring fact of life.

PART II - AUSTRALIA AND THE THIRD WORLD

The same general point can be made about the Australian  interests at stake in relations with the Third World, the  subject I now turn to. Our national interests, which include  the.promotion of national security, the maintenance of our  economic prosperity and the protection of our national '  "  institutions and values,, are not independent of each other. ,

In some situations they may be in competition. Clearly it is  no easy task to agree on the order or priority Which can be  applied equally in all situations.

AUSTRALIA'S SITUATION

The notion of balance is particularly appropriate  to the formulation of Australian foreign policy. The basic  framework for Australian foreign policy is the special set  of circumstances which flow from our character as a developed  Western country and our location in the Asia/Pacific region,  which is predominantly Third World in character.

Australia's identification with the Western group of  countries is based upon a number of factors; political,  cultural and historical ties; defence arrangements with the  United States; and, substantial economic relationships. While we have a high stake in the preservation of liberal

democracy represented by these countries and in their continued  security and economic stability, our interests are not identical.  Our relationships are not without their problems.

Australia has a number of special characteristics  and interests which differ from those of most of the Western  industrialised countries. We are one of the few Western  countries with a colonial history. We depend heavily on  primary commodity exports. Further, our immediate political-

strategic environment is quite different. Located in the

7,

Asian/Pacific region,  Australia's regional relationships are  largely with Third World countries, No Western country other  than our neighbour New Zealand is in a comparable position=

Thus the Third World's significance for Australia"  works .at two general levels= First^ Australia's relations with  a significant number of-Third World countries are important to Ã¢ÂÂ  Â­ us in their own right. Second along with other Western countries  we are affected by the Third World's collective impact on the

course of international economic and political relations, "

I have already mentioned that I had no wish or " '

intention to exaggerate the novelty of many of the issues now  in the forefront of the international agenda. The Third World  is not a new discovery for us. Allowing for differences of

emphasis over time,  Australia's relations with the Third World  countries in our region have been an important and continuous  strand in our foreign policy since the Second World War, Indeed  we should not forget that Australia's emergence as an -  independent  participant in international politics and the development of

our diplomatic service coincided with the independence of the  former European colonies in Asia,

The aspirations and concerns of Third World countries  have,  therefore,  been an important element in Australia's '   foreign policy perspectives for a long time. This was implicit  in Australia's support for self-determination and our early

support for the independence of Indonesia, It was the basis of  Sir Percy Spender's pioneering work in the Colombo Plan and of  Lord Casey's diplomatic initiatives in the region.

The, idealism embodied in. the United Nations charter,   which incorporated important elements of the liberal democratic  tradition, found a sympathetic response in Australia, Australia  invested considerable effort in establishing the moral authority

of the United Nations,  particularly in regard to ensuring the  integrity and independence of small states. Since its foundation  Australia has continued to give active support to the United

Nations, It remains a vital forum for the search for world  peace and stability, I

I believe that a viable world order will depend  ultimately upon accommodation and reconciliation - an order  negotiated by consensus and installed by consent,  that takes  account of the legitimate interests of all groups of countries.

This is a vital goal.

8.

THE NORTH/SOUTH DIALOGUE

Generally,  then.Â»  I see the maintenance of good  relations between the West and the Third World as in important  national, objective. It would not be in our interests if the  adversary relationship,  implicit in such distinctions as North/

South, developed/developing,  deteriorated or hardened into  confrontation. We should take advantage of the present trend  towards moderation and a more pragmatic approach to enlarge  areas of agreement and to work for practical and durable  results. A negative response by the West in the present  atmosphere could strengthen the position of those radical  countries which are arguing that there is a natural alliance  of interests between the Third World and the Soviet bloc!., This is an important point and I will return to it later.  Conversely it would weaken those moderate countries in the

Third World which advocate a more gradual and pragmatic approach  and cooperation in the United Nations context as an alternative  to confrontation.

It follows from this that progress can be achieved  if Third World countries have a strong incentive to participate  in international trading arrangements which are just and  equitable as well as conducive to growth. We do not wish to

see countries opting out because they believe that the system  works to their permanent disadvantage. This would strengthen  demands for radical rather than evolutionary change.

There is also the sound reason,  based both on moral  objections and political realism, that extreme and widening  discrepancies in the wealth of nations,  cannot , in the longer  term provide a tenable basis for a stable international  community. Public opinion in the democracies cannot ignore  -poverty in some of the worst affected of the developing

countries while they enjoy a period of great affluence. These  are factors which are reflected in our foreign policy.

There are other factors which arise from our  particular national circumstances,  and which are relevant to  Australia's assessment of Third World proposals. To the extent  that economic development will promote regional stability in

our part of the world it is of greater importance to us than  to most other developed countries. We must, therefore, be  prepared to make a greater effort than other developed countries  at promoting cooperation which will result in economic and

social development in our region.

9 ÃÂ¿

As a country depending heavily on primary commodities  for a major share of our export earnings,  Australia's interests  on a number of economic issues are close to those of developing  countries. In 1976/77, for example,  rural and mineral commodities  accounted for some 75 per cent of our exports . Many of these  commodities are subject to fluctuations in price and demand.  Agricultural products are subject to protectionist import

regimes in the most important industrialised markets. With  many Third World countries Australia has an interest in greater  stability in commodity trade,  in greater access for agricultural  exports to developed country markets and greater opportunities

for the processing of raw materials in the producing country.

One dimension of these policies is our exchange of  information with other primary exporting countries,  through  producers' associations and commodity agreements, '

These links have inclined Australia to take a more  positive attitude to the Common Fund negotiations,  and the  associated Integrated Program on Commodities,  than other Western  countries.

TRADE LIBERALISATION

With our distinctive perspective Australia also has a  vital interest in the liberalisation of world trade. This is,  of course,  a central objective in the present round of MultiÂ­ lateral Trade Negotiations (MTN), The Government is concerned  that the developed countries are not taking sufficient account  of the interests of agricultural producing countries,  both Ã¢ÂÂ   , developed and developing, A conclusion which resulted only in  an expansion of trade among a few wealthy industrialised  countries and failed to accommodate the export interests of  the rest of the world would not provide the foundation for  balanced international growth, ;

The Government1s position in the MTN has a more  general application. It reflects our recognition of the central  importance of trade liberalisation in stimulating world economic  recovery and growth.

The Third World claim that the present international  trading system does not produce equal benefits for all  trading partners needs to be carefully considered. It might  be equally argued that the NIEO proposals without substantial,  modification would not produce the benefits expected. We need

to bear in mind that economic development in East Asia and the  ASEAN countries has demonstrated the advantages to be derived  from participation in a more open and competitive trading  system. A trading system which has produced in the last  generation the most sustained and widespread economic growth

that the world has every known cannot have been entirely wrong.

10.

Reform which removes the weaknesses and any injustices  but preserves the strengths of that system is clearly necessary.  But we must at all costs avoid the growth of inward-looking  trading blocs.

Ã¢ÂÂ   Protectionist sentiment is an ominous development reminiscent of the economic nationalism of the inter-war period. .  This was an experience none of us would wish to see

repeated. Moreover increasing protectionism in the West is . likely to deepen Third World suspicions of Western motives and  intentions.

I believe not only that ways must be found to bring  developing countries more directly into the international  trading system but also that economic growth in Third World  countries can play a part in encouraging world economic growth.  There will be a greater prospect of progress if the two problems  of world economic recovery and North/South relations are  considered in conjuction. instead of as entirely separate questions.

-  I am suggesting that by giving the development of

Third World countries a higher priority in their economic  policy developed countries could ensure their own future as  well as that of the developing countries. There is much to  be gained from working towards mutually beneficial economic

relationships that will enable both developed and developing  countries to achieve economic or social goals.

I deliberately stress "mutual benefit". The developing  countries would not be the sole beneficiaries of a new emphasis  on economic development and liberalised trade. There would also  be potential benefits for developed countries. There is a

growing body of opinion which suggests that the continued  growth of the developed economies of the West will depend in  the long term-upon economic growth in the Third World. If  there is a direct link between the health of the economies  of the developing countries and that of the industrialised

countries it is very much in our national interest to see more  efforts to encourage economic growth in the Third World.

NON-ALIGNED MOVEMENT

.  Approaching the question from a different angle I  want to look briefly at the Non-aligned Movement. The MoveÂ­ ment is still troubled by elements which seek to align it  with the interests of one or other of the super-powers.

This partly reflects a flagging momentum and partly the lack of  a strong sense of direction. Decolonisation and the rigidities  of the Cold War no longer provide the stimulus they once did.  Although decolonisation will remain an important influence so  long as the problems of Zimbabwe and Namibia remain unresolved.  While the Movement has described itself as the 1  catalyst1  in

the North/South dialogue the carriage of NIEO proposals has  passed to the Group of 77. Â· . .

\ \

11

Several leading non-aligned countries have attempted  to strengthen and revive the Movement by emphasising its  original aims.

These calls have come in the face of the strongest  attempt so far to align the Movement's policies with those  of a major power bloc, Cuba's open call for the Movement to  acknowledge the Soviet Union as its 1  natural ally'  related as  it is to Soviet, and Cuban involvement in Africa presents a  serious challenge to the integrity and relevance of the NAM=

While such moves were rejected at the recent Belgrade  Conference of non-aligned Foreign Ministers;the role of Cuba and  its open espousal of pro-Soviet policies is causing considerable  concern in the Movement. The fact that Cuba will play an  increasingly important role in the Movement during and.after  the Non-Aligned Summit in Havana next year will increase the  difficulties of those countries which want to preserve the  reality of non-alignment. '

Australia,  need I say,  is aligned and we could not  take a direct part in the work of the Movement = This does not  mean that we do not recognise the validity of non-alignment as  the basis for the foreign policy of a particular country0 We

respect the position of many of our neighbours who set great  store by their membership of the MovementQ.  We therefore need  to keep in touch with developments in the non-aligned"wofld=

Ã¢ÂÂ   Clearly Australia would not wish to see any shift in

the Non-aligned Movement away from its basic principles towards  the Soviet position. The pressures on the Movement underscore  the importance the Government attaches to achieving progress in  the North/South context = .  Â·  .  * Ã¢ÂÂ

MULTILATERAL DIPLOMACY .

Failure to consider the political dimension of the  Third World's economic demands also carries with it the risk  it could become increasingly difficult to reach agreement iri  a wide-range of on-going international negotiations= The

simple fact 'is that in a number of international forums Third  World influence has a direct bearing on a number of Australian  interests.

This is most evident in the United Nations and related  bodies such as UNCTAD but it is also important in a variety of  multilateral", arrangements working in. specialised fields,   including the World Bank and other international developmental

institutions, the International Monetary Fund,  the Law of the  Sea Conference, nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament and  multilateral arrangements on shipping,  civil aviation, refugees,   environment protection, infectious diseases,  terrorism and  narcotics.

/

12.

The world has much to lose if 'progress in these  important matters is stalled by a general souring of relations  between developed and developing countries. Furthermore,   although we may not agree with the terms of specific proposals  we have an interest in multinational corporations observing

internationally agreed standards and in the breaking down of  the more restrictive practices of conference shipping lines.

REGIONAL RELATIONSHIPS

I have talked generally of the Third World but it  will be apparent from many of my references already that  Australia is primarily concerned with its relations with those  Third World countries in our immediate neighbourhood. As I

stated in my foreign policy statement to Parliament on 9 May  our regional relationships and policies together with our  relations with the Western democracies and Japan lie at the  heart of the Government's foreign policy.

Australia has invested a great deal of its diplomatic  resources in developing Australia1s relationship with the countries  of the Asian/Pacific region. It has been one of the main features  of our foreign policy since the second world war. In the ^.ast few  years there has been a shift of emphasis in Australia's relations  with the region,  a shift which corresponds to the international

changes I have outlined.

Until recently Australia's relations with the region  tended to be preoccupied with defence and security issues. This reflected the extent to which conflict and instability  dominated regional affairs in the post-war period. In line with

international trends there has been a shift in the relative  priorities in this relationship. Economic ties have become  increasingly important. Australia's relationships and influence  are being judged more directly by the countries of the region in

terms of our capacity to contribute to economic cooperation and  development through trade and investment.

The region remains of basic strategic importance to  Australia. Although at this moment it is a less pressing  concern there is no guarantee that international relations  in South East Asia have completely stabilised or that all the  present Governments in the area are immune from challenges from

internal or external sources. However,  the prospects for  peace and stability are better now than at any time in the last  30 years or so.

It is especially important to realise that in  economic terms we live in one of the most dynamic regions of  the world. Economic growth and structural change have proceeded  more rapidly in East and South East Asia than in almost any'other

region. The emergence of many middle-income developing countries  in Asia with growth strategies built around export-oriented  labour-intensive manufacturing industries has produced a highly  competitive trading environment.

13.

Market pressures are likely to increase,  particularly  as increasing competition between these regional countries may  encourage them to diversify the range of their industries. We  need to give these difficulties the same attention we earlier  gave to the. security problems of our area. How< we are to relate  to the dynamic process of growth in the region and its consequences  is one of the central problems of the coming decadeÃ¢ÂÂ The answer  we arrive at will go a long way towards deciding what kind of a

country Australia becomes .

The Government has long recognised the need to develop  a balanced and expanding economic relationship with the region= .   Trade with the ASEAN countries for. example is significant arid  it is growing with the encouragement of the Australian Government.

Indeed the ASEAN countries have had one of the fastest growth  rates in the Australian market of any group of exportersoto this  country. ,

Already economic growth in Asia and South East Asia  in particular is generating pressures for further market access  in Australia. While this could increase the pressures for  adjustments in Australian industry it Will in future produce  expanded opportunities for Australian industry in these  countries. The extent to which Australia will be able to take  advantage of the benefits of increased trade with Asia and  maintain its economic prestige in the region will depend in

large measure on the ability of Australian industry to adapt  to and complement the output of these rapidly developing market .   economies. These are changes that cannot be prevented or wished  away. We must maintain standards that match those of the  dynamic region in which we live.

ASEAN

The Government has consistently encouraged stability,  and self-reliance in the region = Cooperation with ASEAN which  has become increasingly cohesive and confident is a central  feature of our regional policy. I believe this aim is now  'shared by the Australian community. I

I am confident that the ASEAN countries value the  positive and tangible results of our growing contact over the  years. Although Australian resources are limited it is  essential that we do not stand aside from this impressive  phase of Asian development. It presents us with a challenge  but it also brings a series of new and growing opportunities.

South East Asia is now on the move and it is in Australia's  interest to play an. effective and cooperative role. I have  said time and time again that Australia cannot be indifferent  to the developments taking place in its own region. .  .

14.

I would like to make some remarks about our relations  with Indonesia. This is a relationship which is at the very  centre of our foreign policy. Relations between neighbours are  not always easy since they inevitably involve a wide range of

issues. There have been differences between our two countries .   sometimes on matters of considerable importance. However we  will continue to make every effort to resolve any differences  in an amicable and understanding way. We will ensure that any

differences do not obscure the central importance of the overall  relationship. We have a commitment to maintain the friendship  which exists between the governments and peoples of our two  countries.

A more sympathetic understanding of the immense and  daunting problems faced by our neighbours is vital if we are to  establish the level of community support that is necessary for  the success of our policies. Because Australia is a comparatively

rich country we tend to be most conscious of the disparaties  between our standards of living and that of our neighbours. This can have a distorting effect. Mutual self-respect and  self-esteem are equally important ingredients in the way  countries regard each other. ’ ll hey are no less important  because they are intangibles.

The development of sound and lasting regional  relationships will not be helped by our seeming to insist that  all our own standards and views should be accepted by.'Other  countries. The issue is not that we should relinquish our  own beliefs and standards - indeed we should be even more  confident in them. Rather it is that Australians should try to  understand why the countries of South East Asia are not the

same as we are. I believe that it could help Australia's role  in the region if interested Australians tried honestly to  explain to the public why Asian views differ in certain  respects from our own. Your Institute has already achieved  much in this direction.

In emphasising the necessity for understanding I am  not suggesting that this implies or involves agreement with  all that our neighbours do. The development of sound and  lasting regional relationships will not be helped by

sensational and prejudiced comment on our neighbours' internal  and external affairs.

Basically 'understanding'  involves the way in which  we relate our Western identity to our Asian setting. To put  it in this way is of course to pose the issue in an overÂ­ simplified form. We think of Asia as an entity perhaps  because we see it on maps and because we are accustomed to

think of continents as entities. But this is ppÂ°t how history  l>as treated Asia. No conqueror has ever ru.led3 the whole of  Asia; no common culture has spread throughout' it. Difference  is not the same 'as separateness Australia is a country with a  particular past and distinctive values located in a region of

great cultural and political diversity.

SOUTH PACIFIC Ã¢ÂÂ

i The emergence of a number of new developing countries in the South Pacific has led us to pay greater attention to  that area. Next week. I leave with the Prime Minister for a  meeting of the South Pacific Forum in Niue, The Government

attaches importance to our membership of the Forum, It brings  together the small nations of the Pacific and provides them  with the opportunity to develop and expand the framework of .   regional co-operation. We have recognised our own responsibilities,

in the South West Pacific by expanding Australian representation  and substantially increasing the level of development assistance. We believe it is important that these small nations should have  a chance to progress at a rate consistent with their social ' \ and economic potential. It is desirable that the great powers

should not see in this region a new area for rivalry or tension,

. . .  THE COMMONWEALTH

.  The Commonwealth has also provided an opportunity for small nations to exchange views in a frank and informal  atmosphere. Since its creation the Commonwealth has been an 1   important forum for exchanging ideas with a number of influential  Third World countries, Through the Commonwealth1s machinery  we have been able to participate in a number of valuable :

studies on issues of concern to the Third World. As an example  the Commonwealth recently,  and as a result of an Australian  initiative, made a technical study of the implications of the  Common Fund proposals.

The Commonwealth Heads of Government Regional Meeting  (CHOGRM) held in Sydney earlier this year added a regional  dimension to the Commonwealth, It provides a further opportunity  .  for the small Third World countries in our neighbourhood to Â·

participate in discussions in. a way which is not usually  available to them in the larger meetings = The CHGGRM enabled .   participants to concentrate on. those issues of particular ! importance to the region, I look forward to progress in the  Working Parties set. up at the conference to deal with priority  tetters such as trade,, energy,, drugs and counter-terrorism,

Ã¢ÂÂ   Australia will continue to support the Commohwea11h as a means for sustaining a meaningful dialogue between  developed and developing countries,

THE AUSTRALIAN PUBLIC AND THE iTHIRD WORLD

While I have devoted a good deal of attention to the  activities of the Government in regard to Australia and the  Third World there is no doubt that community attitudes are an  important determinant in the development of our policies.

One of the important characteristics of Australian  travel in recent years has been the great increase in the  number of Australians visiting Third World countries, particularly  those in our own region. This has made a major contribution to  greater understanding of Third World questions and this has been

supplemented by attendance by a large number of Asian and  Pacific students in Australian educational institutions. The  interchange of people has had a major effect on a greater and  more sympathetic understanding of Australia and the Third  World.

The universities have also reflected Australia's  increasing awareness of the importance of the Third World. I believe it is true to say that Australian universities are  now an important centre for Asian studies. Regional history,  geography, language and culture are increasingly taught in  Australian schools. The media has also played a role in

increasing the awareness in Australia of Third World issues.  Organisations such as the AllA have played a valuable part in  encouraging public discussion of these questions. Australian  businessmen have increasingly looked to the markets of Asia

and the Pacific for new export and investment opportunities.  Their activities have also added new substance to our relations.

THE FUTURE

While a great deal has been achieved in improving  mutual understanding between Australia and the countries of  the Third World we cannot rest on our past achievements.

In this address I have sought to identify the major  changes which are affecting the international system. These  changes are perhaps most obvious in our own region. We should  not see the Asian and Pacific area as it was a generation ago  or as it is now but as it is likely to be at the end of this

century. Australia has much to gain from economic progress in  our region. We have the resources and skills to make an  important contribution and to gain important benefits. For  Australia the Third World should not be seen simply as a concept

or a question of cooperation among a group of countries in  international bodies. For Australia the Third World is our own  region. It is here that we will meet our greatest challenge.

The countries of the Third World have shown an  ability to overcome many of their past prejudices and not to  be bound by presumptions which are no longer valid. We must  show the same dynamic flexibility in our own attitudes. If  we do this I am sure we will adjust to the major changes taking  place and retain a respected and welcome place in our region.
