The Hon Malcolm Turnbull MP   Leader of the Opposition

E&OE

ALAN JONES:

Malcolm Turnbull, good morning.

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Good morning Alan.

ALAN JONES:

Where have you been and why?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Well we’ve been in Afghanistan visiting our troops there, principally in Kandahar and  Tarin Kowt which is the, Tarin Kowt is the forward operating base in Oruzgan  Province where most of our fighting men are. That’s where we have a mentoring and  reconstruction taskforce that are working really to build up the local Afghan security  forces and of course that’s where the Special Operations Task Group is located too.  They’re our special forces.

ALAN JONES:

What do you say to the argument that the war in Afghanistan is unwinnable and that  Australian and American troops are merely supporting another form of warlords?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Alan, the strategy in Afghanistan is winnable. What we are seeking to do there and  are doing is firstly to suppress the insurgent activity, to create the opportunity, the  breathing space if you like for the Afghan National Government, which will be having  elections very shortly, to build up its own Afghan National Army and its own Afghan  Police so that it can take over and provide permanent security protection for the  people of Afghanistan. You’ve got to remember this - this country has been tearing  itself apart in wars for decades so it’s not an easy business.

ALAN JONES:

But there’s no way in the world that in a short visit there you’re going to get the full  picture. I interviewed this week on this program perhaps the bravest woman in  Afghanistan, Malalai Joya. At 27 - she’s now 31 - at 27 she was the youngest  person to be elected to the country’s new Parliament. She’s been banished from her  seat and threatened with death because she said I speak the truth about the war  lords and criminals in the puppet Government of Hamid Karzai. Now Karzai as you

know has led the country since the fall of the Taliban in 2001 and you’re right, he  faces a nationwide election in just a few weeks but the paradox is he is deeply  unpopular but likely to win. Now she told me that the United States are handing out  millions of dollars to Northern Alliance commanders, she said the same war lords  whose militias had pillaged Afghanistan during the Civil War. In other words, the  Taliban’s gone and another group of criminals and killers have replaced them and  she said many of them are in the Parliament.

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Well Alan, look, it’s a very contentious country. There’s no doubt about that. The  challenge of course is to build up the civil institutions in a nation that is, really, has  been at war as I said for decades, decades and decades. So it’s very divided. When  you look at Afghanistan, much of it is mountainous desert with fertile areas, green  zones that run along the river valleys and so the communities are very divided one  from the other geographically and of course ethnically. So pulling it together is an  enormous challenge but it is absolutely vital that we do that and the dedication and  the professionalism of the young men and women that are serving Australia there is  so inspiring…

ALAN JONES:

No one’s challenging that, no one’s challenging that. It’s just that she said that all  foreign troops should be withdrawn as soon as possible.

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

I think everybody agrees that the sooner the foreign troops are withdrawn the better.  We all, everyone wants to do that. But the problem is you can’t withdraw them and  leave a vacuum so what the - and you see this with the operation the US Marines  are undertaking to the south of Kandahar and Helmand Province at the moment -  the idea is to suppress the insurgent activity, you know, to beat them, to beat the  insurgents down so that there is a breathing space for the Afghan National Army and  the Police to build up, establish its outposts and establish permanence because of  course the foreign troops, no matter how capable, no matter how committed, are  always going to be perceived by the local population as firstly being outsiders and  also the local population recognises they won’t be there forever. So the only  permanent security protection that gives people the confidence to know that they  don’t have to buckle under to insurgents and terrorists and Taliban can be provided  by, that permanent security, can only be provided by the Afghan Government’s own  national security forces itself.

ALAN JONES:

Okay. Well now the man you’ve just heard and you’ve heard speak there I think  you’d agree fairly articulate, according to the polls today which we must address is in  free fall. Support has dropped in every state and every region, amongst every age  group and every demographic group for the man I’m speaking to, Malcolm Turnbull.  Malcolm Turnbull, how do you address that?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Well Alan I just have to keep on doing my job. One of the great truisms in politics is  the only poll that matters is the one on election day and opinion polls go up and  down and you just have to - and I’ve had polls that have gone up and polls that have  gone down…

ALAN JONES:

But may these polls affect the willingness of people to listen to your message?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Alan, I think they’re always prepared to listen. I think the reality is that as I said  opinion polls are interesting to commentate on and for the media to reflect upon but  the only poll that matters is the poll on election day.

ALAN JONES:

But surely we’ve had Grocery Watch, a fake and a failure, Fuel Watch, a fake and a  failure, Bank Watch, a fake and a failure, Rudd Bank, a fake and a failure. We’ve  now got a Hospital Watch. They were going to take over the hospitals but no, the  hospitals are worse than they ever were but we’re not going to take them over. A  promise of paid maternity leave, a promise of Medicare rebate. Surely when you’ve  got a surplus of $22 billion going to a deficit of 60, a $90 billion turnaround in 18  months, how are you not 30 points in front?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Well Alan, that’s a good question. I just have to keep on getting those messages  across. You’re dead right. This has been a Government that has been very  successful at spin. It’s had one failure after another. You’ve mentioned a few of them  there but the biggest failure of course overall, piling it all together, is the mountain of  debt that they’re building up, this gigantic burden that they’re imposing on  Australians. And what have we got for it? We’ve had cash giveaways which haven’t  created a single job and now we’ve got this scandalously mismanaged schools  building program where they’re rushing out $14 billion of investment in school halls  and libraries. Some schools are getting one hall in addition to one they’ve got  already. There’s no or very little consultation with local school communities. The  Auditor-General is going to have a look at it. There needs to be a thorough  investigation into the way these billions of dollars are being wasted.

ALAN JONES:

But have you been, have you been beaten by your opponent in terms of public  presentation in the last fortnight? Now, you’re a man that went into the Parliament  with a renowned forensic capacity. A lawyer, lawyers base everything on evidentiary  proof. You went gung ho on an email that proved to be a fake. Subsequent to that,  you’ve been lacerated and condemned and it appears as though that message has  prevailed over whatever defences you offered. Were the defences inadequate?  Should you, was the strategy wrong? Should you have waited till you had proof of  the existence of the email and that it was fair dinkum before you launched into an  attack?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Well Alan you make a very interesting point there because I never raised the matter  of the email. I didn’t quote from it, I didn’t refer to it. The criticism I made of the Prime  Minister a week ago on Friday was based entirely upon the sworn evidence given by  the Treasury official before the Senate. So I wasn’t, I didn’t publish an email or wave  it around or refer to it. I was relying simply on the sworn evidence of the Treasury  official given in the Senate Committee.

ALAN JONES:

But you’ve been torpedoed on this issue. It does appear, I mean, according to this  Newspoll, on a two - just hang on, you may not have seen this - on a two-party  preferred basis, Labor at least 14 per cent ahead of the Coalition in every state  except Western Australia. Can you turn that around?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Well Alan we will turn it around on election day, that’s our commitment. We can win  this next election and we should win the next election. If Australians want to see their  economy managed in a way that will not put an intolerable burden of debt and deficit  on the shoulders of their children and their children after them, if they want to see  Australia’s economy managed responsibly, then they should vote for us…

ALAN JONES:

Do you think…

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

…continuance of debt and reckless spending, then of course the Labor Party is there  to be re-elected.

ALAN JONES:

Do you think on issues like Work Choices though, industrial relations, we’re now  seeing the union movement in full cry and yet there was, you actually said well you  know there was a vote, they have a mandate for Work Choices whereas I would  have argued - a mandate to wind back Work Choices - I would have argued that the  Coalition had a mandate to defend the position that they took to the people at the  last election. Do you think that on issues such as this, industrial relations, emission  trading schemes, asylum seekers, your critics are saying you’re too far to the left?  How do you answer that question and you are alienating conservative voters cause  that’s an issue you’ve got to address.

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Well Alan, as far as Work Choices is concerned, Labor has been able to implement  its election policy and the proof will now be, the proof of the pudding will be in the  eating. So Labor says it will not reduce employment. Labor says it will not be a break  on economic growth. We believe it will be and we will see, we will now actually see  what happens. The new regime, industrial relations regime is on foot. As far as  emissions trading is concerned, we are taking a strong position to ensure that

Australian jobs and industries are protected and our approach to that has been  thoroughly responsible.

ALAN JONES:

Okay, so basically you’re saying that you think, in spite of these disastrous polls  today, that Malcolm Turnbull will be able to convince the public that his answers to  the contemporary issues are better than those of the Government?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Absolutely Alan. I just say to you, it’s only a few weeks ago we had polls that  everyone said were wonderful so you have good polls some weeks, you have bad  polls another week. Really, leaders can’t become overwhelmed by polling results.  You just have to focus on the goal and the goal is that the only poll that matters  which is the one at the election and when Australians go to vote in the election, they  will be voting for the party and the leader that they believe will be best able to  manage their economy and ensure that they have jobs, ensure that they don’t have  an intolerable burden of debt which we have to remember, it doesn’t matter what  opinion polls say, it is a fact that the higher the level of government debt, the higher  taxes and interest rates will be in the future. You cannot escape that. And Labor’s  running up debt recklessly. We’ve had cash splashes. We’ve had this extraordinary  business with so much money being spent for so little benefit in this schools building  program. I mean we’re all in favour of investing in schools if it’s done wisely and  productively and effectively but we’re seeing so much money being wasted and all of  that has to be paid for. And those will be the issues that Australians will be focused  on when the election comes.

ALAN JONES:

Okay. Good to talk to you and I thank you for your time.

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Thanks so much Alan.
