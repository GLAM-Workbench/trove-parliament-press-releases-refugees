EMBARGOED UNTIL 1.00 PM MONDAY 12 JULY 1982  IMMIGRATION’S ECONOMIC ROLE *  Ã¢ÂÂ¢

Management of Australia's immigration program in times of

economic difficulty was vital, the Secretary of the Department

of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs,  Mr John Menadue,  told a group

of business leaders in Melbourne today,  .

Mr Menadue was speaking to the Institute of Directors  in Australia at the Southern Cross Hotel,  Melbourne.

"Our migrant selection system must adjust the size and

composition of our migrant intake according to the capacity of  the labour market to absorb the increased supply of workers,"

Mr Menadue said.

"This year out of an immigration program of about 120,000

only about 50,000 will be workers." .

"But it is misleading to focus too much on the short term  costs of immigration."

"Migrants have a significant impact on investment and

consumption.  They spend more than Australian-born people during  the first years after their arrival - an estimated 89.7% of

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ weekly income,  compared with 76.1% for the rest of the population

"They spend heavily on household goods,  cars and houses.

That helps create jobs. It is estimated that last year's

migration intake created a potential for an extra 35,000 houses

to be built.

"Migrants bring into Australia significant amounts of

money. The transfer of funds accounted for by immigration was

estimated by my Department to be around three quarters of a

billion dollars in 1980/81."

Mr Menadue said the Government recognised that the

impingement of immigration on the labour market needed careful  management. In recent years there had been an increasing focus

on analysing the direct economic costs and benefits of migration.

It was also important for business planning,  confidence and

job creation to avoid fluctuations in the program. Ã¢ÂÂ   '  - Ã¢ÂÂ   "  .  . - 4  .  "  -

"The new policy which began operation on 19 April this year

incorporates a computer-based management system," he said.

"This will mean greater efficiency in meeting arrival . . .

targets and preventing delays and inconvenience to migrants.  -  '  ’  * .  ‘

But it will also ensure that the selection of migrants is "

sensitive to the labour market. '  .  .

"The system is geared so that pressure will not be placed

on sectors of the market which have labour surplusesÂ» .  .

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ .  . .  ' i

Ã¢ÂÂ "The basis of the immigration program is social and .

humanitarian as well as economic. We have obligations to our  recent settlers who are concerned about reunion with their

families overseas and we have international obligations to resDond  to refugee situations for which resettlement in another country

is the only solution," Mr Menadue said. .  -

"Immigration has been one of the most important factors in

Australia's economic growth. The immigration program, more than

any other program in the country, is directed to Australia's  future. Its importance reaches far beyond the present  recession."
