BORDER PROTECTION COMMAND INTERCEPTS VESSEL

A suspected illegal entry vessel was today intercepted by the Royal Australian Navy patrol  boat HMAS Bathurst, under the control of Border Protection Command, about 110 nautical  miles north-east of Darwin.

The vessel was earlier sighted by a Customs DASH-8 surveillance aircraft.

Upon reaching the vessel, 37 people were found to be on board.

The Minister for Home Affairs, Bob Debus, said HMAS Bathurst acted quickly to apprehend  the vessel and ensure the safety and security of all on board.

“The group will now be transferred to Christmas Island where they will be detained and  processed. The nationalities and intentions of the people on board are yet to be determined  and no significant health issues have been identified at this stage.

“The Rudd Government is committed to preventing people smuggling at its source and  maintaining extensive patrols of our borders.”
