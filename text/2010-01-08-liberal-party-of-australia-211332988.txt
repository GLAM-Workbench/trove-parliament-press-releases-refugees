ABBOTT INTERVIEW WITH ASHLEIGH GILLON (SKY NEWS)

The Hon Tony Abbott MP

Leader of the Opposition

E&OE

ASHLEIGH GILLON:

Tony Abbott thanks for your time. So far it appears as though no contact has been made between the Australian

and Japanese Governments over the clash on the high seas on Wednesday. Should the Prime Minister pick up

the phone and express his concerns to his Japanese counterpart?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, let’s face it. Kevin Rudd has a history of phone stalking foreign leaders over issues that are important to

him. I certainly think that this is becoming a bit of an international confrontation. I don’t fully know who’s right and

who’s wrong down there. What I do know is that Kevin Rudd promised he’d stop the whaling and he hasn’t done

it. It seems that he thinks he can stop the whaling by sitting in Kirribilli House and watching the whales from there,

but the public know he can’t.

ASHLEIGH GILLON:

So he should speak with his Japanese counterpart?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, he should deliver on his promises. On this issue as on so many issues, Kevin Rudd has been all talk and no

action. Pre-election he said that he was going to stop the whaling by amongst other things, taking Japan to the

International Court of Justice. There was even talk of sending Australian vessels in to the Southern Ocean to stop

the whaling. He hasn’t done it. He shouldn’t make promises that he can’t keep.

ASHLEIGH GILLON:

Couldn’t taking legal action have some negative ramifications for the bilateral relationship with Japan?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, of course it could and that’s why he should have thought long and hard before he made these promises.

ASHLEIGH GILLON:

So you’re not actually calling for Kevin Rudd to take legal action?

TONY ABBOTT:

What I am saying is, that Kevin Rudd should do what he says he would do and he promised to stop the whaling.

He comprehensively has failed and it’s typical of Kevin Rudd, who is increasingly becoming a man who is all talk

and little if any action.

ASHLEIGH GILLON:

The Opposition has been calling for the Government to send Australian vessels south. What would be the point

of doing that? It could be a pretty expensive baby sitting exercise wouldn’t it?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well again, this is something that Kevin Rudd suggested that he would do.

ASHLEIGH GILLON:

Right and it’s something that Greg Hunt has been suggesting yesterday.

TONY ABBOTT:

But, this is something that Kevin Rudd said he would do when he was in Opposition. If Kevin Rudd said he was

going to do it in Opposition, he should be honouring his promises in government and that’s the problem. The

problem is that Kevin Rudd made a lot of promises both in Opposition and in government and he hasn’t

delivered.

ASHLEIGH GILLON:

But Greg Hunt says that this Southern Ocean area needs to be policed. This is actually outside of Australia’s

economic zone. What would be the point of sending the Oceanic Viking or another vessel down there now?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, the Oceanic Viking seems to have its hands full dealing with boat people. This is another one of Kevin

Rudd’s failures. He had the Oceanic Viking tied up for more than a month, effectively being held hostage by the

boat people who are now on the open seas because Kevin Rudd ostentatiously adopted a compassionate

position, which in fact has caused the people smugglers to get back into business and put people’s lives at risk.

ASHLEIGH GILLON:

But just to bring you back to this question. You agree with your spokesman Greg Hunt that a vessel should be

sent down now, today.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I certainly agree that this is Kevin Rudd’s problem and he has got to fix it.

ASHLEIGH GILLON:

This morning, the US President, Barack Obama has made some more announcements about security at airports

in the United States. Do you think that full body scanners should be something that the Australian Government

does, considers seriously?

TONY ABBOTT:

I am not familiar with President Obama’s announcements today. I think we do have to have effective security. I

assume that the Government has got these matters under control. If they want to make increased security

measures operational, well let’s consider them when they’re announced.

ASHLEIGH GILLON:

President Obama has also reaffirmed his commitment to close Guantanamo Bay. Considering the events on

Christmas Day there is a lot of pressure to overturn that decision. Do you think it’s the right thing to do?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look that is a matter for the Americans.

ASHLEIGH GILLON:

In just over a week, Hillary Clinton will be in Australia. If Australia is asked to send more troops to Afghanistan.

Should we?

TONY ABBOTT:

Again, let’s wait and see if the request comes.

ASHLEIGH GILLON:

There is still no evidence that this latest attack in Melbourne on an Indian student was racially motivated yet an

Indian cartoon in a newspaper there has depicted Australian police as the Ku Klux Klan. Should India take a look

at its own attitude?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, they have a robust democracy in India. They have full and vigorous free speech. I might not like that kind of

thing but I dare say there are Australian cartoons that from time to time the Indians wouldn’t like. So, I just think

when it comes to free speech we’ve got to accept the rough with the smooth.

ASHLEIGH GILLON:

Another controversial issue here in NSW. A parliamentary committee has apparently recommended changes to

the adoption act to allow gay couples to adopt. Is there anything wrong with that?

TONY ABBOTT:

And I understand that the New South Wales Government has not accepted that recommendation.

ASHLEIGH GILLON:

Do you think that there is anything wrong with gay couples adopting?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think that kids should have ideally a mother and a father.

ASHLEIGH GILLON:

Ok, so you would say that it is not appropriate for gay couples to adopt?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, as I said, I am on a unity ticket with the New South Wales Labor Government on this one.

ASHLEIGH GILLON:

How strange.

TONY ABBOTT:

It happens.

ASHLEIGH GILLON:

The Liberal Party has always argued for award modernisation. The Rudd Government now is doing that. But

you’ve been accused of running a scare campaign. One of your colleagues is calling the Deputy Prime Minister

Julia Gillard “the evil queen of the workplace”. Is that really called for? Isn’t simplifying the system worth doing?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, we’re running a truth campaign here and the truth, Ashleigh, is that the Government has yet again failed to

deliver. Kevin Rudd promised pre-election that as part of this award modernisation process no worker would be

worse off and no business would be worse off. Now we learn from the Nurses Federation that up to 15,000

experienced nurses could be up to $300 a week worse off because of the process the Government has put in

place. We learned from the Queensland Pharmacy Guild that many pharmacies will have to close on Sundays

and after hours because of the processes that the Government has put in place. So what they’ve done is they’ve

put an award modernisation process in place, they’ve broken a promise, in the process they’ve ripped off some

workers and they’re closing down some services, so it’s no wonder that Julia Gillard and Kevin Rudd look rattled

on this issue.

ASHLEIGH GILLON:

Is there any evidence, though, that you’ve seen in terms of employees actually coming to you and saying this is

definitely going to happen? Because it all seems very speculative at the moment.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, at the moment we’ve got a new system that became operational on the 1st January. Employers are now

required by law to comply with these awards which in some cases haven’t even been finalised, so it’s like the

game has started but we still don’t know where the goalposts are, which is a ridiculous and appalling situation for

the Government to put people in.

ASHLEIGH GILLON:

Compliance costs, though, are expected to be much lower under his system. The Government’s saying that this

Access Economics Report shows that $4.8 billion is going to be saved over 10 years.

TONY ABBOTT:

Yeah, and that report has been subjected to serious methodological criticism. It’s a survey, and a rather small

survey, involving much more big business than small business, so I think we have to take that particular report

with a grain of salt. Look, I’m all in favour of a more efficient system but the Government, as always, has botched

the introduction and in so doing has broken its promises. And this is typical of the Rudd Government making

promises it can’t keep and being incompetent in the actual administration of policy.

ASHLEIGH GILLON:

On the ETS, you’ve kept saying for a while that this ETS is going to cost the average family $1100. Was that just

misinformation in there?

TONY ABBOTT:

No, it was based on reports, based on Government figuring and I’ve been saying this for months and it’s only in

the last week or so that the Government has come out and questioned it. This figure has been in the public arena

for months and it’s never been denied by the Government.

ASHLEIGH GILLON:

Well, the Government was rebutting it before Christmas. Do you accept that that figure’s wrong now?

TONY ABBOTT:

No, I don’t accept that it’s wrong.

ASHLEIGH GILLON:

So you still think it’s going to cost an average family $1100?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think that in some cases it could well cost a lot more than that and if you’re looking for credible, expert advice on

just how much this would cost, look at the report prepared by the Institute for Economic and Industry Research

for the Brotherhood of St Laurence.

ASHLEIGH GILLON:

But isn’t it wrong to state that the average family is facing a cost of $1100?

TONY ABBOTT:

This is the Government’s great big new tax and I will continue to say what I believe to be the case based on what

the Government was talking to the media about some time ago until such time as they can demonstrate that their

great big new tax is going to be less burdensome.

ASHLEIGH GILLON:

But the Government’s saying you need to do your homework on this because you’re throwing out this number…

TONY ABBOTT:

No, no, this is their tax, not mine and that number came from their modelling that they gave to the media in the

attempt to get a good story. Now, if the media think that $1100 is what it’s going to cost the average family and

publish that figure and the Government doesn’t contradict it, I’m afraid that the Government has to wear it.

ASHLEIGH GILLON:

Well, the Government has contradicted it. Just over $600 and most people would get that back in compensation.

TONY ABBOTT:

Low income families. They are talking about low income families. I’m talking about middle income families and as

I said, this was a figure that the media published based on briefings from the Government which the Government

didn’t contradict.

ASHLEIGH GILLON:

Do you think you’re as qualified as Malcolm Turnbull was to talk about climate change and the ETS? Do you

have the good understanding of it, do you think, considering how complex it is [inaudible]?

TONY ABBOTT:

It is very complex. It is very, very complex and this is why Paul Keating’s advice is right - if you don’t understand

it, don’t vote for it and if you do understand it you wouldn’t ever vote for it.

ASHLEIGH GILLON:

Have you had any contact with Malcolm Turnbull since Parliament broke last year?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, Malcolm is a friend of mine, he’s a colleague, and I respect Malcolm too much to offer a running

commentary on our relationship.

ASHLEIGH GILLON:

How about John Howard, have you had much contact with him? Has he given you much advice and guidance?

TONY ABBOTT:

Again, John is a friend, he’s been a mentor to me over many years, but I’m not going to offer a running

commentary on the state of our friendship.

ASHLEIGH GILLON:

I know you’re going to tell me that you’re not the commentator on the polls, that there’s only poll that really counts

to you, but you have been spending a lot of time hitting the roads over this Christmas talking to people, getting

out there on the airwaves. Are you hopeful and confident that the next poll results will show some positive news

for you?

TONY ABBOTT:

I’m not expecting anything other than the kind of polls that we’ve had. I do think that the public are finally waking

up to Kevin Rudd. I think the public are starting to figure out that this guy is all talk and no action. But I think it’ll

be quite a while before that’s reflected in the polls.

ASHLEIGH GILLON:

As you know it’s pretty quiet in Canberra at the moment and all anyone can talk about is when the election might

be. When’s your best guess?

TONY ABBOTT:

Again, that’s really a question that should be directed to Mr Rudd but whenever it is we will be ready for him.

Whenever it happens we will offer him a contest and I think he is now a lot more scared of an election than he

was just a few months ago.

ASHLEIGH GILLON:

Tony Abbott, thanks for your time.

TONY ABBOTT:

Thanks, Ashleigh.
