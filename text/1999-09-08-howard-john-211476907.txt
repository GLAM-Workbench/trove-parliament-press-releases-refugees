TRANSCRIPT 
OF THE PRIME MINISTER

THE HON 
JOHN HOWARD MP

AND HIS 
EXCELLENCY MR JIANG ZEMIN

PRESIDENT 
OF THE PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA

JOINT STATEMENT, 
PARLIAMENT HOUSE

Â

Â

SUBJECTS:Â Bilateral relations 
with China, One China policy, China’s WTO involvement, East Timor, 
Taiwan.

Â

Â

PRIME MINISTER:

Â

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen.Â  The President 
and I have just completed, along with our Ministers, extensive bilateral 
discussions.Â  Both of us have agreed that the bilateral relationship 
which is realistically built on practical cooperation and mutual self 
respect and recognises that there are areas of significant political 
and cultural difference but that relationship is in good shape.

Â

We acknowledge the economic contribution made to 
the relationship.Â  We discussed Taiwan.Â  I reaffirmed the 
One China policy of the Australian Government.Â  I also reaffirmed 
our continuing commercial links with Taiwan which were consistent with 
the One China policy and that we would encourage all involved to resolve 
differences without a resort to any military force.

Â

I took the opportunity to brief the President on 
the situation in East Timor and I outlined the concerns that the Australian 
Government entertained regarding the situation in East Timor.

Â

I re-expressed our very strong support for China’s 
early admission to the World Trade Organisation.Â  My satisfaction 
with the agreement that had been concluded between Australia and China 
in the event of China’s accession to that body.

Â

In the subsequent discussions involving Ministers 
there were exchanges regarding immigration and human rights.Â  Both 
sides expressed satisfaction with the progress made regarding the human 
rights dialogue and we are particularly grateful for the arrangements 
involving boat people arriving in Australia.Â  And there were a 
number of agreements signed between Ministers covering a range of issues 
including energy, cooperation and consular access, consequent upon the 
change of status of Macau.

Â

It is a strong relationship but it’s a realistic 
relationship.Â  China and Australia have different cultures.Â  
We have different political systems.Â  We have different histories 
but there are many points of common interests and over the past three 
years we have sought to focus heavily on them.

Â

And finally, we both acknowledge the enormous part 
played in the relationship by the people to people links between our 
two societies.Â  More than 300,000 Australians speak a Chinese dialect 
in their family home making such dialects second only in the degree 
to which they are spoken amongst non-English languages in this country.Â  
And the contribution being made by Chinese people to Australia not only 
those born in China but also born in other nations is immense and valued 
by the Australian Government and by the rest of the Australian community.

Â

The President’s visit is important not only symbolically 
but as a very significant gesture of time and commitment on his part 
to the bilateral relationship and I warmly welcome him to our country.

Â

PRESIDENT JIANG ZEMIN:

Â

It gives me great pleasure to pay a visit to Australia 
at the invitation of his Excellency Sir William Deane, the Governor-General 
of the Commonwealth of Australia.

Â

Yesterday I arrived in Canberra and before that my 
first stop was in Melbourne.Â  Actually I have been to these two 
places 12 years ago as the Mayor of Shanghai but this is my first visit 
as the head of State of China.

Â

Today I have just had a small meeting and also a 
large meeting with the Prime Minister Howard and his Ministers.Â  
We have had discussions, bilateral relations and other issues of common 
interest.Â  Our talks were very successful and just now five agreements 
have been signed between those two sides.Â  So you can see our talks 
and our visit really has been very productive.

Â

PRIME MINISTER:

Â

First, we have time for two 
questions and the President will be inviting the first one.

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

Well I’m a correspondent with Phoenix TV of Hong 
Kong.

Â

My question is : as you’re going to have a summit 
meeting with President Clinton in Auckland, is there the possibility 
for the talks on China’s WTO accession to be resumed around the Auckland 
meeting?Â  And if the talks are resumed then is it possible for 
China to join the WTO before the coming November, that’s the Seattle 
ministerial meeting?Â  And what’s your best expectation and your 
worst expectation in this regard?Â  And secondly, in your talks 
with Prime Minister Howard have you requested the Australian side to 
maintain neutrality with regard to the request from the USA to have 
a readjustment of the joint defence agreement among Australia, New Zealand 
and the United States.

Â

PRESIDENT ZEMIN:

Â

On the question of WTO, in 1993 in Seattle I already 
discussed this matter with President Clinton and at the time WTO was 
still called GATT.Â  And I made three points on that occasion.Â  
Firstly, WTO as is called the World Trade Organisation - it would be 
incomplete without China as the largest developed country in the world.Â  
And secondly China can only join the WTO as a developing country.Â  
Thirdly, to join the WTO China must maintain a balance between its rights 
and obligations.

Â

Well I’m really reluctant to mention what happened 
on the 8  th  of May this year.Â  The bombing of our Embassy 
in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia killed three of our people, and 
later President Clinton expressed sorry, regret and apology on behalf 
of the United States.Â  But at that moment I don ’t think the 
timing was appropriate for the WTO negotiations.Â  So the talks 
on this regard was suspended.

Â

And since last August we have got messages from United 
States on many occasions expressing the American wish to resume the 
talks in this regard.Â  And President Clinton later wrote me a letter 
in this regard and I also replied to his letter.Â  So now the talks 
actually have already been resumed.Â  So I think this can be counted 
as news for you today.

Â

Last year when President Clinton visited China, at 
the Joint Press Conference with him I said to many correspondents that 
it’s very important to the people in the media to report according 
to the facts.Â  It is agreeable that people may have different views 
but facts must be respected.Â  But I have read from some western 
reports that China has been very eager to ask for the resumption of 
the talks on China’s membership of the WTO.Â  But I don’t think 
that squares with the facts.

Â

Now, the two sides have resumed the talks on China’s 
accession into the WTO I am going to meet with the President Clinton 
soon in Auckland.Â  We will discuss this matter but as for the specifics 
I think that will be for our officials to discuss.Â  But in this 
discussion I think one principle should be abided by, that is equality 
and the mutual benefit.

Â

Actually, early back in 1997 when I visited the United 
States and later in 1998 when President Clinton returned the visit to 
China the two sides had planned to have discussions on the WTO question.Â  
However, due to…according to them, due to the obstruction from the 
Congress the discussion did not produce any results.Â  And this 
year, I think, the American side missed another good opportunity, that’s 
when Premier Zhu Ronji visited the United States.Â  I think at that 
time the agreement could have been reached.Â  But again due to reasons 
from Congress that according to the American side the agreement has 
not been reached.

Â

Well, Prime Minister Howard is my old friend.Â  
So China and Australia have already concluded the negotiations, bilateral 
negotiations, on China’s accession into the WTO.Â  President Clinton 
is also my old friend but I hope the people from the press would understand 
the American system is really complicated.Â  They have the split 
of power and also they have the Congress which is very powerful.Â  
So I think the prospect of the WTO question will be to a large extent 
dependent on the American side.

Â

QUESTION:

Â

A meeting with four leaders from the central American 
countries Lee Teng-hui again reiterated this so called two state notion 
and my question is, what’s your comment on this and will the tension 
in the Taiwan straits lead to an armed conflict?

Â

PRESIDENT JIANG ZEMIN:

Â

I do not intend to spend too much time on this question.Â  
The Taiwan question is purely an internal affair of China.Â  Our 
policy in this regard has always been peaceful reunification, one country, 
two systems.Â  But if there were to be foreign intervention in this 
regard we will not undertake to renounce the use of force.Â  Actually, 
we have all along been having very good will and also there has been 
a good momentum for the development of the cross-strait relations.Â  
President Wang Dao Han of ARAS had planned to visit Taiwan late this 
year.Â  However, all of a sudden Lee Teng-Hui dished out the so 
called two states theory and two states notion.Â  This is something 
that the 1.2 billion Chinese people cannot accept.

Â

The Taiwan question is also 
a very sensitive issue in China/US relations.Â  After the so- called 
two-state notion was dished out President Clinton has repeatedly reaffirmed 
the One China policy and the three (inaudible) commitment.Â  However, 
meanwhile, we   have seen the United States sell additional weaponry 
to Taiwan with a value of US $515 million.Â  So the Chinese people 
really find it hard to understand.

Â

And also the US side has expressed its hope that 
President Wang Dao Han of ARAS will continue to pay his visit to Taiwan.Â  
My reply in this regard is to achieve that there will be two conditions.Â  
That is Lee Teng-Hui must openly withdraw his two-state notion and secondly, 
if President Wang Dao Han is to visit Taiwan then he should be received…we 
can only receive him in a capacity of Chairman of KMT not as a so called 
President of Taiwan because that is something we do not recognise.

Â

I am delighted to hear my old friend, Prime Minister 
John Howard, say that Australia will continue to pursue a One China 
policy in very explicit terms.

Â

QUESTION:

Â

A question for President Zemin.Â  As you know 
[inaudible] to organise a peacekeeping force for East Timor.Â  I’m 
certain the Australian people will be most interested to know what China’s 
attitude is to such a peaceforce.Â  I wonder if you could tell us 
what attitude China has taken in the United Nations towards a peacekeeping 
force for East Timor?

Â

PRESIDENT ZEMIN:

Â

Well I’ve been also following closely the developments 
in East Timor.Â  And Prime Minister also briefed me on the position 
of Australia in this regard.Â  And I think this question should 
be discussed by the UN Security Council.Â  China is a permanent 
member of the UN Security Council and I think that the Security Council 
will find a solution according to the development of the situation.

Â

I’d like to add one point.Â  
I can understand the concern of Australia over the East Timor situation.Â  
But I think as there are so many hot spots in the world these hot spots 
should be resolved through peaceful negotiations and   dialogue.Â  Thank you.

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

I believe you signed an energy agreement with Australia.Â  
Have you given any encouragement to Australian industry that they may 
be preferred suppliers of LNG - the gas - to Chinese industry?

Â

PRESIDENT ZEMIN:

Â

Australia’s welcome to take part in the competition.

Â

PRIME MINISTER:

Â

Thank you.Â  Thank you very much.

Â

Â

[Ends]
