H O W A RD :

Well ladies and gentleman this morning the Coalition is releasing its Schools and TAPE  policies and I'm delighted to be accompanied this morning by Senator Hill, the Opposition  spokesman on higher education and he is also acting for Michael Ronaldson in relation to  schools policy and I'm also particularly happy to have by my side Gary Nairn, the Liberal Party

candidate for the seat o f Eden-Monaro.

The policy that we announce this morning strongly reaffirms the Commonwealth role for  education purposes in relation to schools. It reasserts the importance o f restoring the role o f  TAPE. We have honoured our commitments regarding the maintenance o f funding levels so

far as schools are concerned. There are a number o f new initiatives, several o f them have  already been announced but I'll mention them again. The $60 million in additional support for  rural families through a relaxing o f the AUSTUDY assets test and extra funds for the  Assistance for Isolated Children Scheme. Those decisions were announced by Mr Fischer in  the National Party Policy Speech. We announce today a commitment of $45 million for the

continuation o f the National Professional Development Program for teachers. We are  committed to this program because we value very greatly the professional contribution that  teachers make in both the Government and independent school sectors and it is our desire to  include within this program a component for the professional development o f teachers in the

TAPE system. Many teachers in the TAPE system feel left out o f the mainstream o f education  support, and a way o f recognising their professional contribution is to include them in this  professional development program.

Our commitment to non-Government schools in Australia is well known and I remind you that  it was a pioneer breakthrough by the Menzies Government more than 30 years ago that ended  a hundred years o f discrimination against the independent school sector, particularly the  Catholic school system in Australia. Since then support on a recurrent and capital basis for  independent schools and particularly the Catholic school sector has b e c g ; ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ) f   education funding and it will always be so under a Coalition GoveffjffigpfrAMF.NTARY j

There are two new initiatives I would like to announce today. One is a $30 million program  for new capital - for new capital for non-Government schools. That will be o f overwhelming  benefit to the Catholic systemic system and it will be a program over the first three years o f a

Coalition Government. It is also the intention o f the Coalition in government to abolish the  restrictive new schools policy o f the Federal Government. This policy prevents the  development o f new schools in the independent sector and ironically it is o f particular  disadvantage to the development o f new independent schools which have a low fee paying  system. The change in policy will allow the emergence o f independent schools which charge  low fees and are therefore available to the children o f parents in middle and lower socioÂ­ economic groups in some o f the expanding areas o f Sydney. And we propose to allocate an  amount o f $19.5 million over a three year period to finance our new approach to the  development o f new schools. In particular we are abolishing the cap on Category 6 which has  unfairly discriminated against those who wish to establish new school systems particularly in  the developing suburbs o f the large cities o f Australia.

We're establishing a national schooling strategy and $15 million will be made available for a  national early literacy and numeracy strategy. There will be $16.5 million in additional help to  students with disabilities. We are going to develop a national plan for TAPE and the  establishment o f a TAFE Business Round Table in every state and territory to promote  stronger links with industry.

There are other features o f the policy and I know that Senator Hill has already briefed all of  you and I invite some o f the more detailed questions to Senator Hill because o f his greater  mastery o f the detail o f these policies. But can I finish by saying that the strong commitment o f  the Coalition to an ongoing Commonwealth role in education is undoubted. We value the

importance o f education as being fundamental to the future prospects in life o f all young  Australians. We have a very deep commitment to the Government school sector. We also have  a very strong commitment to plurality in education. We have always recognised the right of  parents to choose what type o f education they want for their children. These policies  announced today will broaden those choices for many Australian parents. They will give  assurance to those who have made their own contribution to the maintenance o f an  independent school sector, that they will have a friend in a Liberal Government. But they will  also reinforce the fundamental, integral role o f the Government school sector in the education  o f Australian children. As somebody who has long respected the contribution o f Government  education to the development o f this country our commitment to that area is undoubted and  part-and-parcel o f that commitment is to respect the professional role o f teachers to enhance  their standing in the community and a number o f the initiatives I've announced today will do  precisely that. Thank you.

Mr Howard, on the question o f costings for this policy and your general policies, the  Government says after having a look at the detailed figures yesterday that they're shonky. Mr  Costello said this morning that they've been checked by the Government's own department.  Who actually did you get to go through the costings and what sort o f guarantee can you give

..?

ÃÂ¯

H O W A RD :

They are not shonky. They have been subjected to the most searching examination and  scrutiny that it is possible for an Opposition to subject it's policies to before they're released.  Given that the Government has had available to it the resources o f the Treasury and the  Department o f Finance and all the additional resources that come with Government, it is  remarkable that ours is the document o f greater substance, ours is the document o f greater  detail. The last thing you can say about our document is that it is shonky and the Government

ought to make up it's mind - the Prime Minister last night was foolishly talking about  Fightback!, Mr Beazley this morning was saying something completely opposite.

While we're on the subject o f costings, the story o f the day about costings is the revelation  from inside the Australian Taxation Office that Paul Keating has blown any chance at all o f  recovering that $800 million by warning the tax avoiders in question that he is going to change

the law in the future. Can I say, you never do that if you want to stamp out tax avoidance.  What you do is you creep up on them and you raid them at midnight. He's like Elliott Ness  warning A1 Capone that he's going to raid a Speakeasy in two months time and wondering  why he doesn't get any benefit out o f the raid. That is exactly what Keating has done. He's  said to the tax avoiders o f Australia, "hey, I'm a wake up to you and what's more, I'm so keen  to get you I'm going to give you a couple o f months notice that I'm coming after you". What  he does is to allow them to reorganise their affairs, to find another tax avoidance scheme and

surprise, surprise, when you turn up at the warehouse the stolen goods are gone.

I know from past experience, may I say, that the only way to be effective with tax avoiders is  to actually make an announcement that a practice is outlawed from the very minute o f that  announcement. But to give people notice is to destroy any real prospect o f recovering the  money. The revelation in The Canberra Times this morning has completely detonated any

credibility the Prime Minister had on this issue. He looks a fool. He's behaved in a foolish  fashion and it is little wonder that the anger o f the taxation investigation officers is literally  dripping out o f the article on the front page o f the Canberra Times.

JO U R N A LIST:

If that $800 million is gone, isn't that a problem for you as well?

H O W A RD :

Well, we're not relying on it for any of our spending commitments. If you look at the  document yesterday, we're not relying on it. We have real savings apart from that $800  million. What we have said is that if any o f it can be collected - and we will chase it but I think  by now they're probably into two or three more schemes they've been given so much notice,  but we will chase it and if there is any money to be collected, it will be collected - and it will be

added to the bottom line and will be available for the benefit o f all Australian taxpayers. But  you've got to be an absolute fool in relation to tax avoidance chasing to give such warning.

JO U R N A LIST:

Mr Howard, can you give a commitment that no more than 7,500 public service jobs will go in

- 4 -

H O W A R D :

That 7,500 figure is wrong.

JO U R N A L IST :

Well, Peter Costello said yesterday 2,500 over three years.

H O W A R D :

No, he said 2,500 is the figure - not 7,500.

JO U R N A L IST :

You're also trying to collect money though on the basis o f guessing who's going to take up  some o f your schemes like the pensioner schemes. All the evidence suggests that people  actually don't stay in the workforce very long after the retirement age. Your person in social  security says that he can't even tell how many people are going to take up the pensioner bonus  scheme and you're estimating it's going to save you $290 million.

H O W A R D :

People have not had this incentive before. That's the key. For the first time, we are providing  people who reach pensionable age the opportunity, but more than that the incentive, to stay in  the workforce longer. Given that people are healthier, they are living longer, their desire to  remain in the workforce is increasing, there will be an incentive. The calculations have been  based on an assessment o f the response affects to suggest that there's no evidence is to ignore  the fact that this is an entirely new scheme. You can't argue that there's no evidence that  people will stay in the workforce longer when at the moment there is no incentive for them to

stay in the workforce longer. Australians have a lot o f characteristics and one o f them is they  always respond to an incentive. If you give people an incentive to stay in the workforce  longer you can be certain many will respond.

JO U R N A LIST:

But aren't you doing what the Government's doing and guessing?

H O W A R D :

No, I'm not guessing. And what's more, I have come clean. I have put documents on the  table. I have explained the basis o f our costings but I've done something even more than that.  I have given an ironclad guarantee that we will legislate in government to ensure that as soon  as the next election is called, the best available forward estimates o f expenditure and revenue

and the state o f the Budget will be available so that this deceitful nonsense we've had from M r  Keating and M r Willis during this election campaign cannot be repeated in the future. I would like to know why the Prime Minister won't match that promise. Paul, why won't you  match my promise on making details o f the forward estimates available? What is the reason?

What do you have to hide? Why do you think that would so disadvantage the Australian  community?

JO U R N A LIST:

...(inaudible)... cuts in the public service will hinder it's ability to operate effectively. Mr  Beazley this morning is arguing that the Government had already cut the public service to the  bone. Can you respond?

H O W A R D :

He would argue that wouldn't he. I don't believe our proposals will hinder the efficient  delivery o f services. I regarded Mr Beazley's response this morning, to which I listened, as  rather disorganised. He really contradicted the line put forward by the Prime Minister last  night. The Prime Minister was arguing that we were draconian - he was saying that we were  ineffective. It's rather like their attack on me - one minute I'm a policy rambo, the next minute  I don't stand for anything. When you send a confused line to the electorate, it's barely  surprising that the electorate has no real idea o f what you stand for.

JO U R N A LIST:

The suggestion from Senator Parer that the Coalition may make Badgery's Creek the principal  airport in Sydney - would that have your backing?

H O W A R D :

No, that's not the policy and no reasonable interpretation o f what Senator Parer has said  would suggest that is the policy - it is not. The policy is to maintain Sydney's Kingsford Smith  Airport but to re-open the East West runway to relieve the unfair noise burden which is now  being carried by some people in Sydney, to proceed with the development o f a second airport  - but that second airport's development will be subject to a proper environmental impact

statement.

JO U R N A LIST:

M r Howard, social welfare groups are saying that up to tens o f thousands o f people would be  forced to go to charity as a result o f your cuts. What's your reaction to that?

H O W A RD :

Well, that's not true. It is simply not true. There is nothing in our policy that will force tens of  thousands o f people to go to charities. There is nothing in our policy to do that. We are not  cutting any benefits. There is nothing wrong with ensuring that people who are not entitled to  get benefits don't get them. There's nothing immoral about that. There's nothing insensitive  about that. We are, in fact, promoting the interests o f those genuinely in need in ensuring that  kind o f thing doesn't occur. I listened last night to a spokesman on behalf o f the St Vincent  De Paul Society being interviewed on the PM  program. I didn't get that message from him

and I would be very happy to talk to any people who have genuine concern.

Can I make it clear - we spent months going over these cuts and I made it very clear from the  beginning as Leader that I was not going to have reductions that would in any way imperil the  entitlement o f people who were deserving o f support and benefits. If you go through our  costings, you will find that is not the case. Take the migrant waiting periods - it doesn't apply  to refugees, it doesn't apply in humanitarian circumstances, it reinforces the contract or the  covenant that exists between the Government and those who sponsor people to settle in this  country. It, o f course, doesn't apply to family allowance and other benefits and it does have a  safety net provision. The policy cannot lead to that kind o f result because it does provide, if  through inadvertent circumstances somebody is thrown out o f work, then the safety net  provisions o f it will operate.

I completely reject any suggestion that tens o f thousands o f people are going to be sent to  charities.

JO U R N A LIST:

Those cuts to the welfare entitlements for migrants - are you not concerned that they'll further  sour relations between the Coalition and migrant groups, ethnic groups?

H O W A RD :

Well I don't have sour relations. Only yesterday the Chairman o f the Federation o f Ethnic  Communities put out a press statement congratulating me for something that the Liberal Party  had done in relation to a candidate in Queensland. I don't accept for a moment that this will  produce any sour relations. You've got to remember that ethnic communities are part o f the  entire Australian community. They will benefit and, can I say, from future policies their  families will benefit from the attitude and the approaches o f the Coalition and this policy will  be seen by the entire community as a very fair policy. It in no way affects anybody now in

Australia. I want to make that very clear. Not one person in Australia - no matter what that  person's origin, if they've only been in Australia for five minutes - they are utterly and  completely unaffected by this policy.

JO U R N A LIST:

But you have marginal seats that are dependent on the ethnic vote. Is there not a lot of  concern ...

H O W A R D :

No, I'm not concerned by that - and this will have to be the last question - I'm not concerned  because our policies are o f great benefit to ethnic communities. Ethnic communities have  families, they have businesses, they are Australians before anything else, they are affected by  the high levels o f unemployment caused by the Labor Government, they will benefit from my

small business policies, they will be able to get the tax rebate for their private health insurance  and they will benefit, and their families will benefit from other policies that I will be  announcing in the course o f the next week.

Thank you.
