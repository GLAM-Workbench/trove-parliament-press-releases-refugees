E. & O.E. - PROOF ONLY

TRANSCRIPT OF TV INTERVIEWS,ORIENTAL HOTEL, BANGKOK, 21 NOVEMBER 19 8 3

JOURNALIST:  What happened,  Prime Minister? :

PM: Well, we had a most useful discussion where we had, I believe,  an identity of views and complete understanding, I believe, on  the part of the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister of  Thailand about Australia's position.

JOURNALIST:  I was just going to say, what did General Prem say specifically about ASEAN?

P M :  Well, we indicated our basic Agreement with the thrust .   of the view of Thailand and ASEAN in regard to the position of  Kampuchea and there was, as I say, an acceptance and understanding  by General Prem and Foreign Minister Siddhi of the identity

between us on the fundamental position. You will recall what I  said before I left Australia, that I was quite relaxed about  this issue, that I thought there had been an over-statement in  some quarters and the extraordinarily cordial meeting that we've

had with the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister here has  totally confirmed my expectations.

JOURNALIST: Sir, was there any discussion whatsoever about some form of peacekeeping mission, be it..

PM: No, it did not arise. We are to have a working lunch with  Foreign Minister Siddhi. It is conceivable that it may be  raised there. It was not raised in the discussion this morning.

JOURNALIST:  Does this mean the row with ASEAN is all over?

PM: Well, I have not taken the view that there is a row with  ASEAN, and I have certainly not taken the view that there* has been  row with Thailand. In my view, and that has been confirmed, I  would feel confident,  as I've said all along that the substantially

sound relationship that exists between Australia and ASEAN will  not only be confirmed, but will be strengthened.

JOURNALIST; Do you expect now that ASEAN will resume its  dialogue with Australia?

PM: I've had no doubt that the dialogue will be resumed.

JOURNALIST: On the issue of Kampuchea, then Prime Minister, is it .. us agreeing to disagree but respecting our points of  view?

PM: It's not a question of agreeing to disagree. There is fundamental agreement about the major thrust. That is the  necessity for the withdrawal of the Vietnamese forces, the  creation of the condition where there can be an expression of

the free will of the people of Kampuchea and the emergence out  of that situation where you a.re not going to have the  possiblity of the imposition of the Pol Pot forces, where  Kampuchea can be an independent country and where you can have

resettlement of the refugees from that country. Those are the  elements upon which we basically agreed. In respect to our  attitude towards the Pol Pot element of the coalition group,  there has been an understanding by the Prime Minister and the  Foreign Minister of our view. INdeed, they share our repugnance

of the Pol Pot forces.

JOURNALIST: Do you get the impression that our ASEAN neighbours  still think that we're bending over backwards to help Vietnam?

PM: No, on the contrary. There was no suggestion of that from the Prime Minister or the Foreign Minister. No suggestion at  all. There was a complete understanding of our attitude.  I  don't think that that sort of view is in fact a realistic  representation of the understanding that exisits of Australia's

basic commitment to the general thrust of the ASEAN countries  view on Kampuchea.

JOURNALIST:  So do you think the attitude of the Thai Government reflects the attitude of ASEAN as a whole, or have you still  got a fight on your hands with Mr. Lee Kuan Yew?

PM: Oh, I don't think I've got a fight on my hands with Mr. Lee  Kuan Yew. I'm looking forward to meeting him in Delhi.  I  intend to have cordial and straightforward discussions with  him. I would imagine that is his intention. I simply come  back to the point that there has been an overblowing in some  quarters of a difference in emphasis. I have been relaxed about

this from the beginning. I remain relaxed totally about it. The fundamentally sound relations between Australia and ASEAN  will, I repeat, not only be maintained, they will be strengthened  under my Government.

JOURNALIST:  Prime Minister, in light of the fact that you've signalled a degree of acceptance of the Malaysian initiative,  some form of force to fill the vacuum of Vietnam after the  Vietnamese go, certainly in light of the fact that Australia has

a dialogue with Hanoi as many countries in the region don’t,  is there now a role for Australia as a mediator? .

PM: I reject the phrase mediator, as Mr. Hayden and I have  from the beginning. We don't think that that is the right  expression. NOw, going back to the first part of your  question, that is about a Malaysian proposal, that is  hypothetical. The first stages have got to be the dialogue  which can produce the basic requirement. That is the  withdrawal of the Vietnamese forces. That is what to

concentrate on, trying to achieve that situation. Now, if  we move from the hypothesis that is contained in the Malaysian  proposal to the-position where there is going to be the  withdrawal, then we can address ourselves to that. We will

do that. It hasn't been raised in the discussions here so  far. It. may be later on with the Foreign Minister. There is  no point in proceeding any further with that except to make *   it clear they did from the very beginning - that we are not  talking about Australian troops in any belligerent sense. The proposition could conceivably be,if the preconditions were  met of withdrawal, of some form of Australian involvement in

helping to ensure the emergence of what is the end objective -  t at is the free expression of the will of the Kampuchean  people. .

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, over recent weeks you have gone out of your way to exercise the fact that you and Mr. Hyaden  have been at one over this entire issue, does he also agree  that it is a good idea to send a peacekeeping force to Cambodia?

PM: Well, you're trying to get to a position which doesn't  exist. That is that the agreemen-  between Mr. Hayden and myself  of a hypothetical response to a hypothetical situation and you  are not taking it any further than that. What we are both  committed to now is the immediate ealities. Ã¢ÂÂ   I mean, there has  been an enormous tendency on the p^rt of you people with

respect, to try and go down tracks which are just not there,  are not realistic, and to talk about a possible hypothetical  situation and then try and get involved in that. What we do  is to deal with the current realities - that is discussion with  ASEAN about the immediate situation. That is what I have been

engaged in with the Prime Minister of Thailand and his Foreign  Minister. That is what we are going to continue to do while we  are here. Â·
