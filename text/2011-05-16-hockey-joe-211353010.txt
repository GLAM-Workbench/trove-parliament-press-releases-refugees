AUSTRALIAN AGENDA

16TH MAY 2011

E&OE………………………………………………………………………………………

PETER VAN ONSELEN:

I want to ask you about election timing.  A lot of Tony Abbott’s budget in reply was based around really pushing  for an early election, arguing that one is necessary.  Let’s just take a look at a few comments on the issue of the  election during the week.

TONY ABBOTT:

Only an election could make an honest politician of this Prime Minister.

BOB BROWN:

There will be no election.

PRESENTER:

But isn’t that really up to Julia Gillard?  Or are the Greens in control?

BOB BROWN:

You can ask Julia Gillard.

JULIA GILLARD:

I will decide when the election will be, and it will be in 2013.

PETER VAN ONSELEN:

Well, which one of those three, Joe Hockey, is going to decide when the election will be?

JOE HOCKEY:

Well, it’s a good question!  I don’t know.  I don’t know the answer to it.  It is quite obvious that Julia Gillard has no  mandate for a carbon tax, and if she was being honest with the Australian people she would test it at the polls, it’s  as simple as that.

PAUL KELLY:

When you travel round the country talking to people, do you detect much of a groundswell at all for an election on  the carbon tax issue?

JOE HOCKEY:

I must say, Paul, I was walking through the middle of Melbourne on Friday and it’s a reaction I’ve not had in  Melbourne in particular, and that is particularly tradies, bus drivers stopping the bus and yelling out ‘you’ve gotta  get rid of this mob!’  There is a growing air of desperation about the government that I last saw here in NSW a  few months ago.  It’s increasing as each day passes.

PAUL KELLY:

But the opposition can’t get an election, can it?

JOE HOCKEY:

No.  We can’t call an election.  But if we could, we would, because this government is breaking the solemn  commitments it made to the people just a few months ago.

DENNIS SHANAHAN:

Now the issue of course of an election now, if there is one it’s a House of Representatives only election, is that a  feasible thing to call for?  And do you really expect the Independents are going to pull away their support from the  government?

JOE HOCKEY:

Dennis, I don’t know about how the Independents will react.  All I can say is this, this last budget was a lost  opportunity.  It was an opportunity to shape the destiny of our country during a transition in the Australian  economy that is going to leave a lot of people behind.  From our perspective, with that coming on top of a clear  broken promise about the carbon tax and the general incompetence of the government across the board, no  better example than what’s happening with the boats arriving on our shores, all of this together means that the  government is failing and the Australian people deserve better.

PAUL KELLY:

If we look at the budget, the budget forecasts a deficit next year of $22 billion.  Presumably the opposition would  like a tighter outcome.  What sort of general outcome would the opposition be looking at?

JOE HOCKEY:

Well, I’d say to you, Paul, of all the data in the budget I was most stunned at the fact that the budget next year,  the one that is actually being delivered, sees a deterioration in the bottom line by $10 billion, when you have  much stronger economic growth, you have lower unemployment.  The government was spinning the line that  they’ve got $22 billion of savings.  In the next 12 months alone, of those savings they’re outspending them by  $2.5 billion.  So they’re spending more in the next 12 months, you’ve got slower job growth, higher economic  growth, and yet the deficit is getting bigger.

PAUL KELLY:

I appreciate that, but where would the opposition be in terms of the deficit?

JOE HOCKEY:

I can’t give you a definitive figure right now because the numbers keep moving on us.  The numbers that the  government provides for the base case are malleable at the moment.  I’d say to you, we outlined more than $50  billion of savings measures including, and we stand by this, the Public Service has grown by more than 20,000  employees in Canberra since this government was elected, and we’ve said 12,000 will go.  That is a starting  point, and if you don’t start cutting your own expenditure upfront, then you can’t expect the Australian families out  there to . . .

PETER VAN ONSELEN:

Mr. Hockey, you say that there’s $50 billion in savings that you’ve identified, but Treasury punched a $10 billion  or thereabouts hole in that in terms of the way it evaluated your costings.  Is there going to be no movement by  the coalition during this second term of the Labor government to re-jig your numbers based on that?

JOE HOCKEY:

No, because we stand by our numbers.  Treasury were so appalled at our numbers that they’ve been picking up,  together with the government, some of the things they criticised, such as access to the contingency reserve.   They criticised us.  The government had done it themselves, yet Treasury has picked it up.  Or I’ll give you  another example.  They were so opposed to us abolishing cash for clunkers that the government has decided to  do it.  They were so opposed to us abolishing productivity places that the government has decided to do it.

PETER VAN ONSELEN:

These are the savings that the government is doing that Tony Abbott referred to in his budget in reply.  He said  that there were $13 billion worth of coalition savings.  In fact, it’s 13 savings measures.  It doesn’t come to $13  billion, does it?

JOE HOCKEY:

Can I tell you, I think they’ll be picking up a few more of our savings measures before time is out.

DENNIS SHANAHAN:

Mr. Hockey, you said that the budget was a lost opportunity.  Now the numbers in the budget you say are  malleable, but they are the numbers in the budget.  If you can identify it as a lost opportunity, where are you  going to take up the opportunity?

JOE HOCKEY:

For a start, the NBN, we now know that the government is spending over the next four years $18 billion on the  national broadband network.  That’s cash out of the budget.  It’s not treated as cash out of the budget, they’re  claiming it turns into equity, and therefore they don’t have to account for it on the bottom line.  But it is a stimulus  in the economy, $18 billion of stimulus.  That’s why the Reserve Bank looks through the cash numbers, and that’s  why the Reserve Bank is now forecasting core inflation at higher than 3%.  That’s why interest rates are rising,  because everyone gets beguiled with the headline stats that the government wheels out, but can I tell you, it is a  stimulatory budget.  There is no doubt about that.  When you add in the NBN and you add in the expenditure of  the carbon tax, it is a stimulatory budget at a time when inflation is rising significantly.

PAUL KELLY:

Can you just tell us, what is the difference in macro policy between the government and the opposition?  Wayne  Swan’s brought down a budget in which he says that Labor will be back to a modest surplus in two years time,  with a modest surplus continuing for the next three years.  So in simple terms, what is the difference?  What  would the opposition do in terms of the outcome?

JOE HOCKEY:

Well from our perspective the government is not going to deliver a surplus.  I mean I stand by that view, Paul, and  I’ll tell you why.

PAUL KELLY:

I understand that, but can we just focus on what would the opposition do?

JOE HOCKEY:

We would cut our own expenditure.

PAUL KELLY:

Yes, but what sort of outcome are we looking at?  I mean I’m asking, what is the macro difference ?

JOE HOCKEY:

You want a raw number?

PAUL KELLY:

No.  I’m asking what is the macro difference between the two sides?

JOE HOCKEY:

Okay, I’ll tell you the macro difference.  Last time when we had a mining boom, we ran a surplus, but it was very  important during the course of delivering that surplus and putting money into the future fund, we were delivering  tax cuts.  Now what happens is that when the majority of Australians look at the government saying times are  good, we’ve got a mining boom, they say what’s in it for me?  During our period of time we delivered year after  year tax cuts, which I saw Craig Emerson claiming credit for over the last three years, even though they never  designed them!  But therefore middle Australia saw a dividend associated with the mining boom.  During this  mining boom when there’s the emergence of all these new billionaires and everyone keeps telling Australians  they’re better off, they’re actually worse off.  They feel worse off and they know they’re worse off.  There’s no tax  cuts, in fact there’s tax rises, and interest rates are going up.

PAUL KELLY:

So the answer to the question is that you’d give more tax cuts?

JOE HOCKEY:

The answer is we’d get the budget to surplus as fast as possible to take pressure off the budget.  And if we had  the capacity to be able to deliver some relief to Australians to grease the wheels of the transition in the economy,  we would do it.  But Australians will resent the mining boom if they are not getting some dividend from it.

PETER VAN ONSELEN:

But this doesn’t sound like it passes the fair dinkum test.  You’re going to give tax cuts, you’re going to make  greater savings . . .

JOE HOCKEY:

No, you’re putting words in my mouth.  I said that.  The first mountain we have to climb is to get the budget to a  real surplus.

PETER VAN ONSELEN:

What’s a real surplus though?  Are we talking double digits?

JOE HOCKEY:

No, I’m talking about a surplus that is delivered, not a surplus promised in two years.  Wayne Swan just delivered  the budget he wants to deliver in two years, and he’s claiming credit for it.

PETER VAN ONSELEN:

But you wouldn't have just delivered a surplus, surely?

JOE HOCKEY:

No.  I didn’t say that.  You’re trying to put words in my mouth.  Just hold back, okay?  I’ll just say to you this.  I  know what Wayne Swan’s going to do.  In two years time he’s going to say look, we couldn’t get to surplus  because we had a downturn in the terms of trade.  That’s his line, right?  But you know what, there’s always an  excuse not to deliver a surplus.  The bottom line is you have to make the hard decisions, and this government  has failed.  It’s attacked families on the one hand, but it’s had a blowout in expenditure such as an extra $200  million on computers in schools, $110 million extra in the pink batts program, $10 million for a website for the  union movement.  I tell you what, the people of Cairns would be desperate for that $10 million to be able to buy  some domestic tourism advertising.

PAUL KELLY:

A short time ago Malcolm Turnbull supported the idea of a sovereign wealth fund.  What’s your view on that?

JOE HOCKEY:

I think a sovereign wealth fund already exists in the form of the future fund.  We set it up.  It’s got about $70  billion in it now.  From my perspective, if you want to have a second so-called stabilising future fund or a second  sovereign wealth fund, that is some years down the track.  People who argue for a sovereign wealth fund need to  explain where the money’s coming from.  Are we going to borrow money to put it in?  Because when you’re  running a deficit and when you’ve got net debt, you actually have to borrow money to put into some . . .

PETER VAN ONSELEN:

So what is Malcolm Turnbull doing advocating it?

JOE HOCKEY:

Look, I think it is a good idea, but ultimately…

PAUL KELLY:

You think it’s a good idea?

JOE HOCKEY:

Well I think it’s a good idea in principle to have a sovereign wealth fund, but it’s many years away.

PAUL KELLY:

Hang on.  You’ve just said that you’re going to get back to surplus, you’re going to have significant surpluses, so  how far away is it?

JOE HOCKEY:

The government says that even on their heroic assumptions, paying off net debt will occur in 2020.  So I suggest,  Paul, that you and I will be looking a little greyer and a little older by the time this is real.

DENNIS SHANAHAN:

Mr. Hockey, you’ve mentioned that Wayne Swan has a line about a surplus being back in the black.  That  happens to be the election year.  Surely you’re not suggesting that he is setting up a false figure which he can’t  deliver six months from the election?

JOE HOCKEY:

It’ll be interesting, it’ll be interesting, Dennis, because you know they’re assuming that there’ll be no major new  spending announcements for the next two years, and that the terms of trade will still be generous with China.   Bear in mind that if there’s just a four percent variation in the terms of trade, those surpluses are wiped out.

PETER VAN ONSELEN:

That’s all true, but if he gets there, if he does get there though, you’ll have egg all over your face.  You’re saying  that there’s no way he’ll get there.

JOE HOCKEY:

No, hang on, hang on.  If he gets there in two years time, it won’t be because of his efforts, it’ll be because of  China and Asia.

PETER VAN ONSELEN:

But nonetheless, you’re still saying he won’t get there.  If he does, then-

JOE HOCKEY:

But look, if there is an increase in inflation in China, and the thing is they’re trying to deal with inflation, they  tightened up again this week, as India tightened up monetary policy again this week, if there is a blowout in  inflation in China the terms of trade move against us.  If commodity prices and you know demand for our  commodities eases off, it moves against us.  And then Wayne Swan’ll say look, it’s out of my control guys, I’m  sorry, terms of trade moved against me.  But that’s no excuse, because the government, they like to use the  benchmark of revenue in the last year of the Howard government, that’s what they use as a benchmark, even  though when the carbon tax comes in it’s going to be blown, right, that’s their fiscal benchmark.  But they don’t  like to use the fiscal benchmark of expenditure in the last year of the Howard government, 22.9% of GDP,  because at no point over the next four years do they get anywhere near 22.9% of GDP, as low as that.  Nor with  the carbon tax involved, it’s blown.  So they’re choosing their fiscal benchmarks and they’re breaking their fiscal  benchmarks.

PAUL KELLY:

I’d like to ask you about a couple of specific measures, the dependent spouse tax offset abolition, what’s the  opposition view on that?

JOE HOCKEY:

You will hear it when the legislation comes.

PAUL KELLY:

So you don’t have one at the moment?

JOE HOCKEY:

Well, I want to go through the process of speaking to colleagues, I think that’s appropriate.

PAUL KELLY:

But what’s your disposition as Shadow Treasurer?

JOE HOCKEY:

Look, my disposition on all of these things is to look at the details of the legislation, Paul, and we will be  responsible.  But we are saying emphatically, getting the budget back to surplus is the big issue, and the  government has to cut its own expenditure.

DENNIS SHANAHAN:

Mr. Hockey, your last reply to the budget turned into a bit of a media debacle.

JOE HOCKEY:

That was in the hands of the media, Dennis.

DENNIS SHANAHAN:

Of course, I did preface it by saying a media debacle.  However, you were left with the impression and carrying  the bag.  How are you planning to present your reply?  Tony Abbott’s basically ignored the budget.  Is yours  going to be more detailed?  Are you actually going to look at the budget bottom line?

JOE HOCKEY:

Yes, absolutely.  I’ll look at the details of the budget, that’s what it’ll be about, about telling the truth about the  budget.

DENNIS SHANAHAN:

And will you provide an alternative?

JOE HOCKEY:

No.  Look, can I say this, Dennis?  The government wants us to do their heavy lifting.  You know, it’s like they’re  contracting out to the opposition the means of delivering a surplus.  Well, we did that last year, we showed them  the path.  It involved genuine cuts.  I don’t want to do this every 12 months.  If they don’t feel they’re up to the  challenge of delivering a surplus, then they can hand over the keys to The Lodge.

PETER VAN ONSELEN:

You mentioned that you don’t want to fall into their hands of just doing what they want in terms of an alternative  budget, but Tony Abbott’s speech was quite removed from that.  Let’s just take a look at some of what he had to  say.

TONY ABBOTT:

Government will spend $350 on each pensioner’s set-top box, when Gerry Harvey can supply and install them for  just $168!  Perhaps this program should be called Building the Entertainment Revolution!  Mr. Speaker,  pensioners and self-funded retirees deserve better than this.

PETER VAN ONSELEN:

Very funny, but what do they deserve that’s better?  What’s the alternative?

JOE HOCKEY:

They can get a new digital TV for $199 from Gerry Harvey.

PETER VAN ONSELEN:

So you’d oppose that?

JOE HOCKEY:

This is another example on top of pink batts and school halls, on top of a failed border protection policy, this is  another example in the Australian people’s mind of a government that wastes their money.

PAUL KELLY:

So you’d oppose that scheme?

JOE HOCKEY:

I don’t think it’s going to have separate legislation, Paul, this is the thing.  I don’t know whether there’s separate  legislation for that.  It’s a payment and we’re not going to stop appropriations.

PAUL KELLY:

If you’ve turned it into a joke, presumably the opposition position will be that you’ll abolish it if the government  introduces it?

JOE HOCKEY:

No.  Let me say, the scheme is in part operating now.  The big revelation is the waste in the scheme, that’s the  big revelation, the waste in the scheme.  That’s what Australians are upset about.  Now as an appropriation, it  might be an existing appropriation, but as an appropriation we’re not going to stop it.  We can’t stop it, unless we  stop supply.

PAUL KELLY:

Of course.

DENNIS SHANAHAN:



You can pledge to abolish it, to withdraw it, repeal it, when you’re in government.  And have you not already  rejected it when you were in government?

JOE HOCKEY:

Yes, but Dennis, this is it, you see.  I’d say that now, but we might get into government in two years time and then  find the scheme’s finished, and you said but oh you’d repeal it.  This is the thing.  Everyone’s trying to lock us  down to a moment in time, which is grossly unfair.

PAUL KELLY:

No, hang on.  This is a credibility issue.

JOE HOCKEY:

Sure.

PAUL KELLY:

Tony Abbott has made a joke of this policy announced in the budget, so presumably the opposition is a joke if the  opposition doesn’t take a stand and say we will rescind what the government has announced?

JOE HOCKEY:

But it’s already being spent, Paul.  How can we-  If it’s already spent, if it’s money out the door, how can we claw  it back?

PETER VAN ONSELEN:

As enjoyable as Tony Abbott’s speech was to watch during prime time television from a laughs perspective, it did  give the government the opportunity to come out and say that he’s not taking this all very seriously.  Let’s just  take a look at what the Finance Minister, Penny Wong, had to say.

PENNY WONG:

Mr. Abbott failed to put forward a single new policy, a single new save or a single tough decision.  Tony Abbott’s  budget in reply shows he is all opposition and no leader.

PETER VAN ONSELEN:

Is there not enough leadership going on in the opposition at the moment?

JOE HOCKEY:

No, that’s just government spin.  I mean, you know, Tony Abbott announced a number of changes in relation to  regulation, setting up a scheme similar to that in Victoria which is rather popular with VECCI and the BCA, set up  by a Labor government in Victoria to reduce red tape and save a billion dollars a year for business.  The  government says there was no new policy; of course there was.  That was in the speech, plus a whole range of  different measures that we committed at the last election.

PETER VAN ONSELEN:

Existing measures.

JOE HOCKEY:

You know, most Australians may not have been aware of it because of all the static on the screen during the  election, but we are being consistent and stable, and that’s what’s important.  Australians want stability in  government at the moment.  They want consistency; we are delivering that.

PAUL KELLY:

Do you think the changes to the family tax benefit arrangement are class warfare?

JOE HOCKEY:

When they attack people on $40,000 a year, yes.

PAUL KELLY:

What about $150,000?

JOE HOCKEY:

This is what Labor does, rob Peter to pay Paul.  We warned that this was going to be the case, that they were  going to go down this path.  Our objection, and I’m not suggesting the media commentators here, but some  media commentators are saying well you can’t walk both sides of the street.  Yes, you can say it is time to have a  tough budget, but if they do have a measure that we don’t like, we’ve got to speak out about it, in this situation  cutting $2 billion from families when they’re facing higher living pressures.  Paul, I went to the Boronia Park  supermarket yesterday and bananas are $13 a kilo, which is basically $3.50 per banana.  You know, people were  standing there saying to me this is really expensive, and they’re right.  Now that was obviously the events in far  north Queensland, but this is what people see every day, a doubling of electricity prices and so on.  So cutting  family payments at this moment is silly.  It’s silly when they’re facing higher interest rates and higher taxes.

PETER VAN ONSELEN:

You mean in principle though.

JOE HOCKEY:

Now what has been lost, and this is again the government spin, families on $40,000 a year are having their FTB  supplement frozen, which means a real cut over the next three years in their family tax benefit.  Now that’s been  lost in the debate.

DENNIS SHANAHAN:

Mr. Hockey, on the NBN, Malcolm Turnbull has suggested it may cost billions to unscramble the egg.  Is it going  to be the same position as it is for set-top boxes that if the coalition gets into government you can’t unscramble  the NBN?

JOE HOCKEY:

It’s a question of timing, Dennis, about whether you can unscramble it or not.  It depends how much is committed,  whether contracts are signed.  On all of these programs we can only give a moment in time difference of policy,  and that’s why the closer to the election it is, the more realistic it is because it’s dealing with the information we  have at that moment in time.

Now I’ll just say to you, in the NBN case, again look at the budget papers carefully.  Buried in it is the $18 billion  for the NBN, which is a substantial injection of money, but it is a significant stimulus over the next four years.  But

it’s not accounted for in the cash deficit, cash surplus.  If that money were actually accounted for, then obviously  the budget would be in deficit for a further two years.

Now I’ll just make this point.  70% of the money being spent on the NBN is digging trenches, is civil work, 70%.   So the question is, what have you got at the end of it?  You’ve got some cable, you’ve got maybe a capacity to  generate some income, but it’s extremely limited.  And it’s at exactly the wrong moment.  They’re talking about  the massive investment in infrastructure by miners and so on over the next few years, plus the rebuild of  Queensland, and you’ve got a government that is engaging in a huge infrastructure project which in itself is going  to stimulate the economy.

PAUL KELLY:

What’s your response to the point made by Trade Minister Craig Emerson earlier on this program that if Australia  doesn’t legislate an ETS, then Australian industry and business will be subject to retaliation from the European  Union, along the lines of the problem that Qantas now faces?

JOE HOCKEY:

If that’s the case, then countries in Asia obviously would suffer the same retaliation, which I find rather hard to  believe.  This is part of the scare campaign that comes before the storm of the carbon tax.  I don’t accept it, I  don’t believe what Craig Emerson has said is correct.

PAUL KELLY:

You think it is all a furphy?

JOE HOCKEY:

From my perspective, Australia is going to disadvantage itself with a carbon tax.  I have no doubt about that.  I’ll  just make this point.  If you look at budget paper number one, basically the government keeps comparing us on  all this economic data with the United States and Japan and Europe.  But yet they say this is the Asian century  for Australia, so they should be comparing us with Singapore, with China, with India, with a range of other  countries, even though that is the developing world, because we are in a unique position.  We are a developed  country in a developing world and our competition over the long term is going to come out of Asia, not out of  Europe and the United States.  So I’d just say to you, Paul, we have to think carefully about what the impact is on  our industry, on our businesses, of a carbon tax, because ultimately I believe it’s going to work against us.

PETER VAN ONSELEN:

Mr. Hockey, with the time we’ve got left I think we should look at this whole population strategy.  Tony Burke  came out yesterday and released the government’s 12 month enquiry or search into this.  Targets were wrong,  that was the essence of what he had to say.  Let’s just take a look at some of his words.

TONY BURKE:

The one thing you can be sure of if you were today to set a population target in an area or a population cap is in  ten years time you would find in one direction or the other you had got it wrong.

PETER VAN ONSELEN:

Do you have any sympathy whatsoever for the idea of a big Australia, the need to have high immigration, higher  perhaps than the coalition have even talked about, to be able to sustain the kind of economic growth that you as  Treasurer would want?

JOE HOCKEY:

From my perspective, in last year’s budget papers the government warned of capacity problems, and this year it’s  trying to rebuild welfare to work after effectively dismantling it over the last few years.  Welfare to work is very  slow.  It’s very slow to create the worker base and it needs substantial investment.  So obviously there has got to  be some increase in the number of skilled workers in Australia, and they have to come from somewhere.  Now  the government announced I understand a 16,000 person increase in skilled migration.  I don’t know how long  this boom is going to continue, but the challenge is the capacity constraints in the Australian economy at the  moment.  From my perspective, this is a government that just completely ignored them.  They have totally  screwed up the debate on population.  They went out there and said-  Kevin Rudd went out and said let’s have a  big Australia.  Australians are prepared to cope with a bigger population if the infrastructure works.  Therefore he  put population ahead of infrastructure.  He should’ve put infrastructure ahead of population.

PAUL KELLY:

But of course the opposition ran very strongly on this issue, suggesting that the rate of population increase  should be cut back.  That was the very firm view . . .

JOE HOCKEY:

Yes, on the basis of the fact that Australia’s infrastructure did not have the capacity to cope with the sort of  population targets that the government was talking about.

PAUL KELLY:

Sure, but the implication from what you’ve just said, given the resources boom, given the capacity constraints in  the Australian economy, surely the implication is that gradually we have to increase the overall immigration intake  on this skills basis?

JOE HOCKEY:

Well, we don’t have a big issue at all with 457 visas, for example.  In fact we’d significantly expand them.

PAUL KELLY:

What about the extra 16,000 in the program?

JOE HOCKEY:

The increase in skilled migration is in part addressing a temporary problem.  The government needs to think  about how it can build the infrastructure to address a larger population, even from natural growth.  This is the  challenge.  We had a number of initiatives during the election that brought people over the age of 50 immediately,  for example, into the workforce, off welfare and into the workforce, and we had a mobility allowance for under 30s  to get people to move to where the jobs are.  But this is part of the transition in the Australian economy that no-one’s really talking about, which is hugely important, Paul.  And I hope that we can have a discussion about that  at some point, because that is going to drive our population, the transition in the Australian economy.

PAUL KELLY:

Don’t you think we should have political leaders saying this?  I mean isn’t the real reality here that we need to  have a growing population to fuel the resources boom, to fuel the demands of the economy?  I mean at the end  of the day, this is the core point, surely?

JOE HOCKEY:

Provided it’s sustainable, and that’s what sits in the mind of every Australian.  What is sustainable?  If you’re  sitting in traffic in the city taking two hours to get to work and someone comes up to you and says we want to  double your population, no matter who you are, you’ll be anxious about it . . .

PETER VAN ONSELEN:

But that’s about governments just fixing those infrastructure problems rather than turning around and seeing  immigration as the issue.

JOE HOCKEY:

Correct, exactly right.  That’s the mistake Kevin Rudd made.  He put the cart before the horse.

PETER VAN ONSELEN:

Alright Treasurer- Shadow Treasurer, Joe Hockey.

JOE HOCKEY

No, feel free to call me Treasurer!

PETER VAN ONSELEN:

We are almost out of time.  One final question, given the Sunday papers, do you have an opinion on whether the  first bloke should pop the question to the Prime Minister?

JOE HOCKEY:

Look, I wish them well!

PETER VAN ONSELEN:

I’m not surprised by that.  We will leave it there.  We appreciate you joining us on Australian Agenda.  And thank  you to our panel, political editor at The Australian newspaper, Dennis Shanahan, and editor-at-large, Paul Kelly,  thanks for your company as well.
