JOURNALIST: Okay, so let's start with this gender spending package which you've been  travelling around the Pacific talking about. Three hundred million dollars over 10 years. Do  we know any specifics of what that money's going to be spent on yet?

MARLES: It's $320 million over 10 years. There are three pillars to this. The first is looking  at encouraging representation of women in public office. As we know, within the Pacific,  women are significantly underrepresented in the parliaments of the Pacific and part of this is  trying to encourage women to come through the system and to give them the skills so they  can participate in political life. An aspect of that for example is to try and promote mentoring  of female politicians in Australia and within the Pacific. So that's the first focus. The sec-.

JOURNALIST: On that, just before we get to the second thing, one of the things that often  is encouraged in these countries is some kind of temporary special measures. Reserved seats  for women, for example. The three women MPs of Papua New Guinea recently ruled that out,  supporting that - they don't want that. Would Australia encourage those kinds of measures, or  is it more about that mentoring, the training of prospective MPs, encouraging political parties,  that kind of thing?

MARLES: We're not prescriptive in any sense about which way countries go on that issue.  It's good to see the discussion and the truth is the discussion's been going on in the Pacific  now for a couple of years and PNG's played its role in that. There are going to be arguments  on one side or the other in relation to that, and indeed there are different proposals out there.

It looks like we will see a proposal come through in Samoa which will provide for, in effect,  the statutory minimum of 10 per cent of women in the next election in Samoa. There are  similar debates in the North Pacific. There are similar debates in the Solomon Islands. I think  the debate is important. We understand that countries are going to make their own decisions

in relation to this. In terms of Australia's support for this, it's often about whatever is the  outcome in the particular country.

What we do think is important is that the women who do end up in politics and also women  who are coming through the system get the support they need in terms of the skills and  exposure to the experience so that they're in a position to put themselves forward. And that's  why we see mentoring as being a very important step for women.

JOURNALIST: Okay, so the second…?

MARLES: The second pillar is in terms of economic empowerment, and this is very much a  grassroots aspect to this. Take markets for example where fruit and vegetables might be  traded, and other foods. Often it is women who are doing that work. Now in many places  what will happen is that women will come to the markets and they'll actually stay overnight  while the market is going on. What that then means is that the security of those environments  is critically important to the ability for women to participate within them. So an aspect here is  to see that markets are properly safe, that they have appropriate lighting, that they are secure  places for women to participate.

That's an example of the kind of thing that would be pursued in relation to this economic  empowerment pillar, so that women can participate as fully as possible within the economic  life of the countries.

The third pillar is really to continue the campaign to prevent domestic violence. Domestic  violence rates are of course far too high around the world. They are particularly high in the  Pacific and coming up with programmes which make it clear to people that it is not an  acceptable practice is an important aspect of this as well.

So those three pillars form the basis of the programme. It is something that will evolve over  the course of the 10 years, but it's a significant amount of money which has been put forward.

Really in our mind, what it does is back up the gender equality declaration which was made  by Pacific Island Forum leaders in the Cook Islands, which is really a historic moment in the  history of gender empowerment and gender equality within the Pacific. I think in decades to  come we will look back at 2012 as being a watershed moment, and particularly the Pacific  Island Forum Leaders' Meeting in the Cook Islands as being a watershed moment in the role  of women in the Pacific.

JOURNALIST: The three pillars all work together. For example, if we know that women are  more economically empowered, we know they are more likely to get into some kind of  political life. Obviously economics has a huge impact on those violence rates. Is there a  worry - and I know that this was a worry for the Forum leaders at Cairns - that this money is I  guess coordinated well between those three things, that it's not just a programme here and a  programme there looking at those three different things?

MARLES: I think that's an absolutely valid point to raise, and making sure that the  programme is coordinated is very important. But I'd say it does very well in relation to  programmes of this kind, so I'm confident that will be done in a way which does see a  genuine outcome. But what is really important is that we do see a quality change in the role  that women play within the Pacific. I think Ban Ki-moon put this very succinctly when he

presented to the Pacific Island Forum here in Auckland last year. He said, 'This is obviously a  human rights issue. It's a huge human rights issue in terms of the rights of women in a  society, but it's a huge development issue as well. You are unlikely to be able to succeed in  the development of a country unless you empower every citizen within it, and show me a  country where women are empowered and I'll show you a country which is developing fast'.  That is really the lesson that we need to take from this. Because again, one of the difficult  truths that we're going to have to face is that the Pacific is not tracking as well as we would  like in relation to the Millennium Development goals, and this is a part of it.

JOURNALIST: Okay, turning to Nauru and Papua New Guinea. There's been some fairly  strong criticism from both Amnesty and the UNHCR of the detention camps. What response  do you have to them?

MARLES: Well the first point to make is that the facilities in both Nauru and on Manus  Island are part of a set of proposals that the Australian Government is putting forward to try  and stop people taking what is one of the most dangerous journeys in pursuit of refuge  anywhere in the world. And that's getting on a boat in Indonesia and trying to cross that water  to Christmas Island.

Now the fact of the matter is that, in relation to that journey, people are dying in their  hundreds. When we look at the human rights of this situation, we need to be thinking about  that loss of life, because there's no bigger human rights issue than that. That is the single most  important motivator. From the point of view of the Australian Government, we are trying to  stop the death at sea associated with that. The processing facilities in both Manus and Nauru  are a part of that. People are being appropriately and properly cared for in both Nauru and  Manus. Again the fact of the matter is that the Australian Immigration officials who are  working in those facilities are by and large living in the same kinds of circumstances as those  people who are within the facilities. The facilities are temporary facilities at the moment.  Permanent structures are being built, and so the circumstances in both Manus and Nauru will  get better when the permanent structures are completed. But in the context of what's there at  the moment, appropriate care is being provided: food, water, shelter, medical care. Activities  are being provided on a daily basis. So we are confident that the circumstances in those  facilities are appropriate by international standards. But again, I reiterate, we've got to see all  of this in the context of a set of proposals which are aimed at stopping death at sea - and that's  our most important objective here.

JOURNALIST: Given that they're temporary shelters at the moment, one of the issues,  especially in Nauru, seems to have been that there was this rush to establish the camp before -  or it seemed like at the time - before anyone actually knew it was there. But before  [indistinct] had required before, there was a legal framework in place to determine what the  refugee status was. Did you go in too early? Did Australia do this too quickly?

MARLES: No. Were we keen to do this as quickly as we could? Absolutely, and the reason  for that is as I've stated. We're trying to build a deterrent for people so that they don't get on  those boats and risk their lives in the process. People were dying on a daily basis, so every  day counted. That's the first thing to say. So absolutely, we were trying to do this quickly, and  we're unapologetic about that. But no, the legal frameworks were in place and we made sure  that there were temporary facilities in place which did meet the basic care and needs of the  people who were going to inhabit them. Might I say, that does include Australian  Government Officials who are operating within those facilities. So yes, this had to be done

quickly, but all the care was taken and the legal frameworks were put in place. That's actually  why, if you look at Manus, it did take a few extra weeks for that to get on line compared to  Nauru. There was a fair bit of criticism in Australia about why Manus was taking so long  rather than it happening too quickly. But the reason why Manus took the time that it did is  because we wanted to make sure that we got it absolutely right before people arrived there. I  think we have taken the steps that we needed to take, but it was right to be trying to take  those steps as quickly as possible.

JOURNALIST: Both the UNHCR and Amnesty want immediate changes to the camp. So  are there steps that you can take that the Australian Government can take to improve them in  the meantime before those permanent camps are in place?

MARLES: Well I think having in place the permanent camps will be the most important  thing that we do. Work is being done on that as we speak, so there is improvement inherent in  that. We obviously are very keen to maintain a dialogue with the UNHCR in relation to the  facilities and we've been doing that from day one and we will continue to make sure that they  operate in the best possible way they can. Of course Australia is open to discussion about all  of that. But it is important that these facilities are up and running and functioning. And when  we consider this debate - and this is the important thing - every actor in this debate needs to  have their mind around this: what are we going to do to stop people getting on those boats?  Because when they do, they risk their lives and people are going to die. That is the issue. As  we have these discussions, not everyone wants to think about all the different aspects of it.  From the point of view of the Australian Government, we have no choice, and we have a  responsibility to be looking at the totality of this situation. We simply need to be stopping the  death at sea.

JOURNALIST: One last question on that issue: the UNHCR's concerned about the lack of  clarity in terms of both Nauru and Australia and whose job it is, whose legal responsibility it  is for these people, and they say that under international law legal responsibility is for both  Australia and Nauru. Do you agree with that?

MARLES: Well we have arrangements in place which deal with this situation which meet  both our international obligations and those of Nauru and those of PNG. There has been  extensive legal advice that all the parties, Nauru, PNG and Australia, have taken to make sure  we get the arrangements right and we are confident that the arrangements are right.

JOURNALIST: With Papua New Guinea there seems to be closer and closer links between  Australia and Papua New Guinea, Australian officials being in local governments essentially  - 90 odd Australian officials. Is there a sign that this is a new version of the Enhanced  Cooperation Programme?

MARLES: It is right to say that we are working very closely with PNG and it's a relationship  which is growing closer by the day. It's also right that our aid budget is growing in PNG in  absolute terms, but having said that, the proportion of aid or the proportion of the PNG  Government's revenue which is Australian aid actually has shrunk since independence and  over the long-term will continue to do that. There may be some blips on that graph, but that's  the basic trajectory of it. PNG is one of the most important relationships that Australia has. In  a development assistance sense, it's our second-biggest development assistance partner, next  to Indonesia, but increasingly in an economic sense there are many many Australian  companies doing literally millions of dollars' worth of business in PNG and particularly in the

resources sector. In a people context, there are lots of Australians working in PNG. There are  actually lots of Papua New Guineans, particularly mining engineers, who are working in the  Australian mining industry as well. It is our nearest neighbour. There are Papua New  Guineans who every day commute to work to Australia in the Torres Strait. So whichever  way you look at it, this is a fundamentally important relationship. And we see PNG as a  country which is at a cross-road. It has gone through a very difficult year, but having said  that, it has pulled off a democratic election on time, which is a fantastic achievement for that  country. What has come from that election is the formation of a government which has been  endorsed by three former prime ministers in the parliament, which has the vast majority of  MPs supporting it, supporting a new generation leader in Peter O'Neill. And so you're seeing  this generational change at the same time as probably the biggest economic or resources  boom the country has seen since independence. This is a critical moment in the history of  PNG and we want to be there as the very best friend we can be, supporting PNG at that  moment to see a transformational change in that country. I know that's very much the  aspiration of the government, politicians and the politicians that we've met and worked with  in PNG and we want to make sure that we can support them in that. It's a very exciting place.

JOURNALIST: There was some criticism last week of Australia's investment in the  Liquefied Natural Gas Project. Are you confident of that project, given all its problems?

MARLES: 'Yes' is the answer to that question, but the real point here: the LNG project is the  single most important economic project which is happening in PNG. Not to support the  Papua New Guinean Government in trying to yield a social dividend from that project which  is very much what the Papua New Guinean Government is trying to do, I think would be  negligent on the part of Papua New Guinea's close friends. We have to be involved in that,  and we have to be doing everything we can to see the LNG Project succeed in economic  terms but succeed in a way which sees that there is a social dividend to the country and there  is a benefit from this project which affects ordinary Papua New Guineans. Now that's why  we've been working very closely with the PNG Government in the establishment of the  Sovereign Wealth Fund, and there is an admirable commitment on the part of the  Government in PNG to see that fund established, so that the benefits which come from the  LNG Project are there for generations to come, for the people of PNG. We've been working  with the Government in relation to that. We've been working with the Government in relation  to other areas, such as dealing with the large number of workers who are coming into the  country in order to build the facility. There are Australian companies involved in investing in  the facility and indeed in building a fair amount of it. It's right that Australia should be there  helping PNG in relation to what has the potential to be a transformational project for that  country. So it is easy to criticise these projects. At the end of the day, it's happening. It  matters greatly that it works well, and we need to be there, again, being the best friend we can  be to PNG in supporting that project.

JOURNALIST: And what about, how good a friend is Australia with Fiji?

MARLES: Well the answer to that question is, we are good friends with Fiji, and we have  been good friends with Fiji since 2006, so I might point that our development assistance  budget, our aid budget into Fiji has grown all through the years since 2006 and has grown  very significantly in the last year and a half. So there has never been an issue between  Australia and the Fijian people. What we have been saying is that we want to see Fiji returned  to a state of democracy at the earliest opportunity and returned to its place in the Pacific  family at the earliest opportunity. Now the good news is that there has been progress in Fiji

and significant progress during the course of this year. The Constitutional Commission, the  work of which will be presented to the Government very shortly has opened up a political  space and a political dialogue which has been really important. We wait with great  anticipation as to the outcome of that and what a potential new constitution would look like.  The next step will be for the Government to put together the constituent assembly which will  ultimately ratify the constitution, leading in to elections in 2014. So we are seeing Fiji  walking down a path and we are cautiously optimistic about the path that they're walking  down. It's obviously very important that Fiji continues to put its faith in the democratic  process and that we do see free and fair elections with public scrutiny occurring in 2014. And  if we can see that - I mean that's the outcome that everyone wants, and that will see Fiji  returned to the international community in a completely normal way. And even in relation to  specifically the electoral and the constitutional process: Australian has made sure that we are  the single biggest bilateral donor to Fiji to help that process along, because we want to put  our money where our mouth is. When we say we want to help Fiji in its return to democracy -  we actually want to do that, and we are.

JOURNALIST: And reappointment to the High Commission, New Zealand's going to do the  same thing soon; relaxing of those travel restrictions for Ministers of the Government. That's  all, I guess, a softening of that relationship?

MARLES: We are seeing the relationship grow, and we're seeing the relationship grow  commensurate with the progress that I've just articulated that is occurring in Fiji. We very  much commend Fiji for taking the steps it has, and we are seeing a growth in the relationship  as a result. We've just announced that our High Commissioner to Fiji will be Margaret  Twomey and she will be starting there in February. This is consistent with the outcome of the  Trilateral Meeting in the middle of the year between Australia, New Zealand and Fiji where it  was announced that our diplomatic status would be upgraded to having full High  Commissioners. Margaret's a former deputy High Commissioner in Fiji. As of today, she's  our Ambassador in Russia and she will be taking up the job in February. So this is a good  step forward and I understand that during the first half of next year we're likely to see a High  Commissioner in Australia from Fiji, and the wheels are turning in relation to New Zealand's  High Commissioner being ultimately appointed in Fiji as well. So everything is moving in the  direction we would all want to see it move in. I think what's important is that Fiji stays the  course and the faith that they have shown in democracy to this point in time, over the last 12  months, continues through to 2014 so that we do see the free and fair elections that everyone  wants to see.

JOURNALIST: Just very quickly: one of Fiji's biggest aid donors and in fact around the  Pacific is China, and that influence continues to grow. I know this was a big deal at the  Pacific Islands Forum in the Cook Islands and especially with the increasing influence as well  of the United States. Is Australia concerned that it's going to lose its status as the dominant  state in the Pacific or is there room for everyone?

MARLES: Oh well there's certainly room for everyone, and this isn't about Australia being  the dominant state in the Pacific, and I'm sure that New Zealand feels the same way.

We're deeply engaged in the Pacific; of course we are, because this is Australia and New  Zealand and the Pacific's collective neighbourhood. We are neighbours and we are going to  be deeply engaged. No-one has an exclusive right to this, and nor do we want it. We  understand that the countries of the Pacific are going to make friends around the world, and

that is something that we really encourage. The issue here is that development in the Pacific  is hard. It's hard because you're talking about small populations in geographically isolated  areas, and it is difficult to get together critical mass when you're talking about economic  activity or delivering a health programme or educational programme. It's hard work. So if  there are countries out there that want to help in this work, well they are welcome with open  arms. And people often ask us what our attitude is towards China's engagement in the Pacific.  Well the simple answer is: we welcome China wanting to help. We would like to work in as  cooperative a way as we can, and we've said to China we would like them to participate in the  Cairns Compact, which is the compact which looks at aid coordination within the Pacific.  Now to this point in time, China's not doing that, but we're encouraging China down that  road. Having said that, at the Pacific Island Forum, China announced the Trilateral Project  with New Zealand to deliver water sanitation into the Cook Islands. This is a really important  step forward. So we fundamentally welcome China's engagement in the region. The only  message is: we want to work with you China in doing that, but we really appreciate the fact  that China's willing to help. And in terms of America, it's the same. America's had a long  history in the Pacific, but we have definitely seen a deepening in the engagement in the last  couple of years. That is an unambiguously good thing, and the more we see of America and  the more we're able to leverage off very significant American assets in the region such as the  US Coastguard in terms of fishery surveillance, the better. I think that's the philosophy that  we bring to this. If you want to come and help out in the Pacific, that's great. We're really  keen to work with you and Australia does not see itself as having any exclusive role here at  all.

JOURNALIST: Lovely. That's fantastic Mr Marles. Thank you very much.
