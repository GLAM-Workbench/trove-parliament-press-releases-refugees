Topics: Labor’s Border Protection Crisis / Latest Illegal Boat Arrival

Ben Fordham

It’s a new year but the boats are still coming. The 5th asylum seeker vessel to arrive in 2012 has been  intercepted in Australian waters. Some people have pointed out to me that this has really dropped off  the news agenda somewhat. On board 56 asylums seekers and two crew members, as I say the 5th  asylum seeker vessel for 2012 and we are not that far into it. Let’s now go to Michael Keenan Shadow  Minister for Customs and Border Protection. G’day Michael.

Michael Keenan

G’day Ben, How are you?

Ben Fordham

Good. We are not too far into the year and five boats have arrived.

Michael Keenan

That’s right and it just shows you that 2012 is going to shape up to be a bonanza year for people  smugglers unless the Labor party heeds the warnings and actually does something differently. We  can’t afford the status quo to continue with people smugglers being in charge over who is coming to

Australia and I hope these five arrivals give them cause for thought to say we must do something  differently and embrace policies that are actually going to work to stop this evil trade.

Ben Fordham

Obviously this has been a hot topic for yourself and Scott Morrison and the Opposition Coalition. Do  you get the sense that this is somewhat dropping off the news agenda a little bit?

Michael Keenan

It is still a red hot issue as I move around my own electorate because people expect the  Commonwealth government to actually provide integrity in our immigration system and to provide  some semblance of border protection. I am probably not the best person to ask as I am involved in it  everyday, so it still seems to be a very important and red hot issue in the electorate to me and it should  be because it is a fundamental responsibility of the Commonwealth Government to control our borders.  We have had almost 15,000 people arrive illegally under the Labor party and I get the sense that  Australians expect a lot better.

Ben Fordham

I have almost forgotten where Chris Bowen and co got up to with their policy. Obviously we had East  Timor, that didn’t work out, then we had Malaysia, that didn’t work out, there was talk about a deal on  Nauru, that didn’t work out. What is the current plan of attack from Labor?

Michael Keenan

Unfortunately Chris Bowen and Julia Gillard and their colleagues have embraced every single policy  position it seems other than the one we know works. What I would hope is that their next policy  position, and your right there has been countless policy positions over the past 18 months, what I  would hope is that their next policy position is to do something sensible to actually address the issue  and we know what that is Ben because we have done it before and we know exactly what works  because we have tried policy prescriptions and they have actually stopped people smuggling. So that  is the policy prescription that we need to go back to and that has been our policy for the last ten years.

Ben Fordham

Ok we will wait and watch the next arrival, I’m sure it won’t be long. Michael Keenan thank you.

Michael Keenan

Good to talk to you Ben.
