Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

On Gough Whitlam’s comment overnight on Laurie Brereton, 
what’s your initial reaction?

Â

BEAZLEY:

Â

Well, in case you hadn’t noticed, Gough and Laurie 
are having a bit of a fight about history. As far as the issue is concerned, 
the East Timor issue, Laurie moved the political debate in Australia 
along. And I notice today Alexander Downer coming out and saying things 
had moved faster than we’ve taken account for. And, indeed, they have 
and that’s precisely the argument that Laurie has been making for 
the last 18 months.

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

What about Gough Whitlam’s comment that he’s the 
least educated Foreign Minister, or Shadow Foreign Minister that the 
Liberal or Labor Party have ever had?

Â

BEAZLEY:

Â

Well, first thing I’d say is: I don’t think Gough 
likes him much. That’s the first point. And they’re having an argument 
so everything has to be viewed within the context of an argument. Secondly, 
while Alexander Downer is around I think that’s a rather harsh judgement.

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

Don’t you think, as Leader, it’s time for you 
to intervene and possibly put an end to this running feud?

Â

BEAZLEY:

Â

Intervene on Gough? Suggest to Gough that he ought 
not to speak publicly? I mean, really, forget it. This is an historical 
argument that they’re having. And the real issue is the issue as to 
what we ought to be doing about the situation in Timor. And Laurie has 
basically been well ahead of the game on this one. The Government has 
been running hard to catch up to the position he’s put forward. And 
I just hope that they do and that they get the right outcome. I see 
in the papers today that they’re now starting to think about the sorts 
of concerns about things that we ought to be doing should the East Timorese 
people decide upon independence and I don’t have a problem with that.

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

Do you have confidence in Laurie Brereton?

Â

BEAZLEY:

Â

Absolutely. He’s added some interesting new dimensions 
to Australian foreign policy, seized the agenda the moment he walked 
into the position and basically the Government has been, on so many 
fronts, trying to catch him up.

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

.. .doing on East Timor, though, Mr Beazley. Should 
we be sending in troops or just a peacekeeping and administrative....?

Â

BEAZLEY:

Â

Well, ultimately, we are going to have to sit down 
and work through a largish package, and a package that’s associated 
with the political arrangements that come through should independence 
be voted for. We have a very distinct preference that the activities 
of Australian police officers, or soldiers, ought to be related to a 
peacekeeping exercise, not a peacemaking exercise. We hold very firmly 
to that view. The political settlement on the ground has to be reached 
by the East Timorese people by themselves, not externally imposed by 
Australia or anyone else. We also have a distinct preference for any 
operation to be under the auspices of the United Nations and that it 
be multi-national. These are propositions we put a long time ago and 
they seem to be the basic contingency plan that’s going on in Defence 
and the Government now.

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

So, you’d be comfortable for Australian troops going 
over there, or police?

Â

BEAZLEY:

Â

In the context that I’ve now mentioned, yes. But 
I’ve said that before. That’s no news. We’ve said that now for 
some considerable period of time.

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

Back on this debate between Mr Brereton and Mr Whitlam, 
it can’t be good for the Party with an elder statesman arguing with 
one of your Shadow Ministers.

Â

BEAZLEY:

Â

Well, I suppose it gives attention to the issue, doesn’t 
it? But I think when you’ve got a person who is justifiably proud 
of his record as Prime Minister, as Gough is, he will defend every aspect 
of it. Laurie felt that when reviewing our Timor policy that he needed 
to look back over historical aspects of it and that’s provoked an 
argument. We can live with that.

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

In hindsight, should Laurie Brereton have handled 
this a little bit more delicately?

Â

BEAZLEY:

Â

I think in hindsight Laurie Brereton got off the mark 
on Timor at precisely the right time.

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

So, should Gough Whitlam pull his head in?

Â

BEAZLEY:

Â

I’m not going to ask Gough to pull his head in. 
I mean, Gough is an Australian icon. He is a distinguished elder statesman 
and I always listen to Gough when he’s got anything to say on any 
matter. I don’t necessarily always agree, but I always listen.

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

Do you agree on this matter?

Â

BEAZLEY:

Â

I think you’ve already heard me on  the subject.

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

Just finally, what about the Northern Territory Chief 
Minister saying we may see a flood of boat people on our northern shores 
if East Timor gets any worse?

Â

BEAZLEY:

Â

That should not be our motive for being concerned 
about affairs in Timor. Our motive should be a genuine concern for the 
people of Timor arriving at a decent outcome in relation to self-determination 
and then what we ought to be doing is making life as easy as possible 
in difficult circumstances for them at home in Timor. But we always 
ought to be aware that that has happened before and it could happen 
again. So, as we enter into what may well be the final stages of an 
act of self-determination, those Australians who might feel it’s none 
of our business ought to reflect on that aspect of the history of affairs 
vis a vis Timor.

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

What’s your reaction to the trade deficit?

Â

BEAZLEY:

Â

This is the third set of bad figures within a very 
short space of time and there is no excuse on the Government’s part 
now for complacency any more. We must not have an ego driven tax package 
because the people who are experiencing most difficulty, as evidenced 
in these current account figures, are precisely the people who would 
be damaged if the Government removed accelerated depreciation allowances 
and R&D tax concessions. This is not the time for that sort of ego 
driven experimentation.

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

So what should the Government be doing now to get 
it back on track?

Â

BEAZLEY:

Â

The Government should be doing many things. It shouldn’t 
have cut the export programs that were left. It shouldn’t have cut 
the R&D concessions, most of which go to firms which are export 
oriented. It should have made absolutely certain that in the business 
tax package that it was foreshadowing, front and centre should have 
been the issue of nation building and the development of Australia, 
not some artificial effort to get down to a particular level of business 
taxation.
