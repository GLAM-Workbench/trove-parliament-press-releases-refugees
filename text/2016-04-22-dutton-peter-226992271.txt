MORE EVIDENCE OF A LABOR BACKFLIP ON BORDERS

The people smugglers’ boats will start again under a Shorten Labor Government.

Labor’s supposed support for tough border policies is falling apart - even before the election is  called.

Further evidence of the pending backflip comes from Labor’s candidate for Indi, Eric Kerr.

Last night he told a public forum hosted by the Paul Murray LIVE programme on Sky News that  he opposed his party’s border policies and would fight to change them.

“I personally, as the candidate, will come out and happily say it; that I am not a fan of that  plan (regional processing centres) - which is an interesting thing to do as a candidate.”

“It is my prerogative and my narrative…..to be a fighter, to fight for change within my  own party.”

Mr Kerr is not alone; just weeks ago Tanya Plibersek described key policies that have stopped  the boats - boat turn-backs and regional processing as “toxic”.

The problem for Mr Shorten and Mr Marles is that Ms Plibersek is the party’s Deputy Leader - a  deputy who opposes her leader’s policy position.

And she is not alone either. Former leadership contender and prominent frontbencher Anthony  Albanese is strongly opposed to Labor’s position voting against it at the party’s national  conference. Labor’s Senate Leader Penny Wong is also opposed.

The momentum is building. Mr Shorten and Mr Marles will not be able to stem the tide.

As Mr Kerr has made it clear - Labor’s Left will work to wind back their policy until they succeed.

The boats will start again under a future Labor Government, chaos and criminality will return to  our borders, lives will be lost at sea, detention centres will re-open and Labor will again fill them  with thousands of illegal boat arrivals.
