VISIT TO INDONESIA



I will visit Jakarta on 27 February to meet with Indonesia’s Foreign Minister,  Hassan Wirajuda, and attend an international counter-terrorism conference.

Relations with Indonesia are in excellent shape and I look forward to this timely  opportunity to meet Dr Wirajuda to pursue key bilateral interests, including counter-terrorism cooperation and efforts to combat the shared problem of illegal fishing.

Following the opening of the counter-terrorism conference by President  Yudhoyono, I will deliver a keynote address, underscoring Australia’s firm  commitment to working with Indonesia and our other neighbours to combat  terrorism.  The conference will bring together counter-terrorism officials and other  experts from over 30 countries, including Australian Federal Police Commissioner  Mick Keelty.

Hosted by the Indonesian Crime Prevention Foundation in Jakarta, the conference  focuses on suicide bombings.  The 2002 Bali attacks highlighted the threat that  suicide bombings pose to our region. The critical importance of addressing this  threat was again reinforced by the 2004 Australian Embassy bombing and the  October 2005 Bali attacks.
