PRESENTER:

Tony, good morning.

TONY ABBOTT:

G’day John.

PRESENTER:

How did you go this, did you do 38km on your bike today?

TONY ABBOTT:

No, no, nothing as dramatic as that. I just went for a little trot along the banks of the Fitzroy River in  Rockhampton.

PRESENTER:

A trot. Because your previous Coalition leader the former Prime Minister John Howard said last week at a  dinner in Cairns you make him look like a wimp.

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, well, you know, I’m about 20 years younger than John so you wouldn’t be surprised if my exercise  regime is slightly more vigorous.

PRESENTER:

I’ve got Gavin King with me also from the Sunday Mail today, Tony, just to talk to you about what Saturday  means to you and potentially to the people of Australia. But I want to talk specifically about local issues for  a moment, if that’s alright. And specifically I want to talk about the issue of the dugongs and turtles here.  Now the point was made on this programme by your environment shadow last week, Greg Hunt, that yes he

2

will be pursuing the elimination of all hunting at places like Green Island and Michaelmas Cay, Low Isles.  Can I have your, your also commitment to that pursuit?

TONY ABBOTT:

Yes, of course you can, John. I think it’s very important that we look after the dugong population and yes a  100 per cent no take in those green protected zones like Green Island, Low Isles and Michaelmas Cay. Yes, I  am absolutely in favour of that and let’s hope that we’re in a position to do it after the election.

PRESENTER:

Beyond that, too, I just want to ask you about your commitment on the, well the closure of the Coral Sea is  the issue up here. It’s caused some concern, of course those on the other side of politics are very excited  about the prospect of closing down the Coral Sea. I want specific information from you on your direction,  not just here in the Coral Sea, but right around the coastline of Australia?

TONY ABBOTT:

Yeah, John, right around the coastline of Australia there is a real threat from the imposition of these so-called marine protected areas. Now, this is being done without in some cases much good science, without in  almost all cases serious consultation with the affected parties. I’m against it. I think it should stop. In the  first week of a Coalition government we would suspend this process and we would start again with proper  consultation, with proper science and the assurance that if anything was done that impacted upon peoples’  livelihoods there’d be proper compensation. Because you can’t impose changes on things which have been  happening for a long time, perfectly happily, that damage peoples’ livelihoods without making appropriate  recognition.

PRESENTER:

Tony, Gavin King from the Sunday Mail. Quite apart from the Coral Sea proposed lockdowns, commercial  fishers are really struggling, all up and down the Queensland coast. Cairns used to be Australia’s biggest  seafood fishing port. You’ve been out, you’ve spoken to commercial fishermen. They are really on their  knees, quite apart from just the Coral Sea lockdown. Is there anything that the Coalition can do to help this  industry? It’s an iconic Queensland industry. We’re importing massive and massive amounts of seafood  from countries that don’t have any regulations. What can you do for commercial fishing industry?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, Gavin, look I think the best thing I can do is not to make their burdens heavier, to do no harm that’s  the best thing I can do. So look, just at this point in time I don’t have any additional benefits that I can give  but I tell you, if we stop this whole lock up the oceans process which is being driven out of Peter Garrett’s  office that would be I think a pretty good place to start.

PRESENTER:

Can I ask you this one, this will test your, the briefing you’ve received, Tony, today. And this is on the issue  of what is the cultural precinct, if you like. But the way Warren Entsch refers to it now it’s the cultural  precinct come sporting precinct. Now, his point is it doesn’t have to be on the waterfront. He’s concerned  about the future expansion of facilities to take on, for example, a bigger naval port, to take in bigger cruise  ships or whatever. He wants it adjacent on a block of land that actually joins on to the Convention Centre.  But he wants a lesser construction, if you like, than a quarter of a billion dollars worth. He says spread the  money around various sporting facilities et cetera as well. Are you across this? If indeed you are, this is  going to need the cooperation of a State Labor Government to get his version off the ground and I’m not  sure it would be forthcoming given that I understand that the whole concept as we understand it at the

3

moment has been put together by State Government apparatchiks, if you like, in the back rooms of the  government department in Brisbane.

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, John, I don’t claim to be absolutely full bottle on this. I have been spoken to by Warren on a number  of occasions about it. You’re right, Warren thinks that the existing proposal is on the wrong site and he also  thinks that it will be better done if there was more of a sporting focus and look, I’m happy to commit to  going down that path. We’ve committed $15 million to commence construction on the Cairns hockey  stadium and the idea is that this will eventually form part of a larger art, sporting and cultural precinct. As  for the question of cooperation with the State Government, well nothing is going to happen if we’re relying  on the State Government to do it all itself and I think that the State Government, regardless of its political  complexion, will be happy to cooperate with the federal government if the federal government’s prepared to  spend money.

PRESENTER:

Tony, one of the most impressive things that I think you’ve done in your political career is spend some real  and long time on indigenous communities up in Cape York. You really got your hands dirty, so to speak.  Given your fairly intimate knowledge, certainly a lot more knowledge than, you know, people in the big  cities, of the situation up there why hasn’t indigenous affairs got a single look in during this election  campaign from both sides?

TONY ABBOTT:

Gavin, look, it got a bit of a look in yesterday, if I may say so, at the Press Club. Because what I announced  yesterday and spoke about at the Press Club is a move from a welfare state to an opportunity society and  some of the elements of the policy that was released yesterday, the relocation allowance, the commitment  bonuses that long-term unemployed people would get if they got a job and stayed off welfare for 12 months  or 24 months. The fact that if you take the relocation allowance and leave a job within six months you can’t  go back on welfare for six months. The elements of this policy have been very much inspired by Noel  Pearson and the extraordinarily gutsy and innovative work that he’s been doing on Cape York. So what was  announced yesterday was not specifically for indigenous people but it has been inspired by the indigenous  experience and in particular the analysis and the prescriptions of Noel Pearson in response to the indigenous  experience.

PRESENTER:

Tony, what jobs are there at Aurukun and Coen for you to come off welfare?

TONY ABBOTT:

And that’s why it’s important that people be prepared to relocate. There aren’t any jobs in Aurukun right  now. But there are jobs in Weipa. There aren’t many jobs in Coen but there are jobs in Cairns and this is  where a relocation allowance, really serious on-the-job training in conjunction with say Twiggy Forrest’s  Australian Employed Covenant and then these commitment bonuses with the, I suppose, the quid pro quo of  the people who take these relocation allowances and take the guaranteed jobs under the Australian  Employment Covenant. If they leave those jobs there is a penalty and the penalty is no access to welfare for  six months. So this is very much part of the Pearson vision which I’ve been happy to embrace by way of  policy.

PRESENTER:

Tony, we took a few calls earlier on from people out there in the audience wanting to put questions to you.  One with regard to an ETS. Would the Coalition introduce an environment tax? This is from Steve in Cairns.

TONY ABBOTT:

Yeah, and John the answer is most definitely not. The only people who will give you an emissions trading  scheme or a carbon tax are the Labor Party and if Labor is elected the so-called citizens’ assembly will be  brow-beaten into recommending an emissions trading scheme and that’s what we’ll get. But the one thing  that the Prime Minister won’t be honest and upfront about pre-election is the certainty of what amounts to an  electricity tax, whether it be formally an ETS or formally a carbon tax it amounts to an electricity tax and  that’s an absolute racing certainty if Labor wins this election.

PRESENTER:

Obviously Labor has made merry of you being quoted, in fact they’ve got a grab of you we see again and  again saying ‘I can of course give no guarantee on every aspect of industrial relations’ or whatever. Steve  also asks the question will the Coalition bring back WorkChoices under a different name?

TONY ABBOTT:

And we’re not playing word games here. WorkChoices is gone for all time, in any shape, form, in any guise,  it’s just gone and the point I make, John, is that employers tell me, workers tell me that there’s been too  much change and they just want a period of stability. Which is why legislation won’t be changed in the first  term of a Coalition government. It will never be changed to do anything that amounts to the restoration of  WorkChoices.

PRESENTER:

Now, Stan in Cairns asks of Tony Abbott would the Coalition consider reintroducing investment allowance  on plant and equipment?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, if we haven’t announced it and I don’t believe we have we won’t be doing it anytime soon. What we  did talk about yesterday though is a form of infrastructure bonds to encourage private investment in  infrastructure projects. Now we’ve got, they say, a $700 billion infrastructure shortfall in this country. If we  wait for government to find that money we’re going to wait a long time. Yet there are lots of big funds,  including superannuation funds, that could potentially invest in infrastructure projects and we are making  that investment a little easier.

PRESENTER:

You would have picked up on the criticism on page one of The Australian today that this could distort  markets and encourage tax rorts.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, we think that we can do it in ways that avoid any rorts and at the moment we’ve capped the scheme to  $150 million a year cost to the revenue. So what we think it could do is have a sort of a multiplier effect by  attracting private investment into infrastructure projects and ensure that we could get much needed  infrastructure much more quickly than if we had to wait for government to stump up the full cost.

PRESENTER:

Tony, in my little local coffee shop this morning I was talking to a fellow caffeine addict about funding  commitments and costings. They made the comment that Labor here in Leichhardt, Jim Turnour seems to  have all of his commitments backed up by a minister. They’re costed, they’re firm commitments. The fellow  diner made the comment that Warren Entsch seems to be able to have this magical ability to say I’ll give $2  million for this and I’ll give $40 million for this and so on and so forth. You, the Coalition has come under  some criticism for perhaps not being as transparent in its costings. Are all of Warren Entsch’s commitments,  which are now quite sizeable, are they all fully funded, costed and able to be, you know, to come through on  the ground?

TONY ABBOTT:

Yeah, sure Gavin. Look, the thing is that all of our spending promises have been submitted to an  independent third party for costing and Joe Hockey and Andrew Robb will be releasing that analysis and  those costings later on today. So look, we’ll stick to our commitments and unlike the Labor Party all of the  specific commitments that we’ve made during this campaign are funded by reductions in expenditure. Most  of Labor’s commitments are funded from hollow logs that they created in the Budget this year and last year.  So when Julia Gillard comes to town and rides through throwing cash at various local projects and she says  ‘oh, this is all provided for out of the Budget,’ what she means is that in the Budget Labor created various  regional programmes that it put big pots of money in and now it’s spending it as a form of electoral bribery.

PRESENTER:

Just quickly and I would imagine you’re about to get the wind-up too, can I make this point. It’s been  suggested, particularly in The Weekend Australian, that if you lose on Saturday you can put this down to a  lacklustre advertising campaign headed by Brian Loughnane not going hard enough. Not aggressive enough,  not making enough of the waste aspect the $2,000 million lost in the school halls programme, there’s the  roof insulation, the pink batts if you like, there’s the introduction of waterfront public housing. What do you  say to that accusation?

TONY ABBOTT:

Oh, John, look if you win the advertising was brilliant, if you lose the advertising was rubbish. I mean, this  is always what happens after the election if the result was not what you wanted you look around for  someone and something to blame. But I think that the advertising has been a good balance of positive and  negative. We have had a positive message to sell, we haven’t just been relentlessly negative and personal the  way the Labor Party has and I also think that our negative advertising has been fair. It’s not been based on  lies the way the Labor Party’s negative advertising has been. So look, John, I’m very happy with the  campaign that’s been run. I think it’s been very disciplined. It’s been very united. We haven’t had nearly as  much money to spend as the Labor Party which has outspent us by a factor of two I would think on  advertising. But nevertheless it’s been the best campaign possible in my judgement.

PRESENTER:

Tony, this morning the Australian Navy intercepted yet another boat. It was coming towards Christmas  Island. What are people saying to you on the ground across Australia about this issue of boat people? You  have made it a fairly central plank of your election campaign. Is it really that much of a concern that’s being  portrayed in your campaign?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, it’s interesting Gavin, and I better make this my last answer. But it’s interesting, I’ve just been at a  workshop in Mackay talking to, Gladstone sorry, talking to local people. And one of the locals, I’d been  talking about the mining tax essentially and one of the locals just sidled up to me and said ‘look, the one  thing that really worries me is the boats’ and he said ‘how can we be a sovereign country if we don’t control

6

our own borders.’ I think a lot of people feel very strongly about that and we did have a boat problem in  2001. Former Prime Minister Howard took strong action, the boats stopped and unfortunately Kevin Rudd  and Julia Gillard changed the rules and now the boats are coming again and that’s why I think one of the  most important things that I could do should we win on Saturday is put strong border protection policies in  place and on day one I’ll be picking up the phone to the President of Nauru and within a couple of, within a  few weeks we should have the Nauru processing centre open again and that will send a very strong message  to people smugglers.

PRESENTER:

Have you already agreed on an arrangement from day one with that President of Nauru?

TONY ABBOTT:

We can’t negotiate from Opposition but I’ve certainly had some discussions with the President and he tells  me that they would love to host the facility and that it’s in reasonably good nick and they’d be able to get it  open again very quickly. So that’s something that I look forward to doing on Sunday if I get the opportunity.

PRESENTER:

Alright, Tony Abbott. Look, many thanks for running over time too today. Thank you.

TONY ABBOTT:

No worries, John.
