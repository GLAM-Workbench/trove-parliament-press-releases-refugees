Kerry Nettle, Senator for New South Wales





Government continues failure to plan for climate refugees

Senator Nettle, 12th February 2007

Senior Immigration department officials today admitted that no analysis or reports into the  impact of climate change on people movements has been done by the department.

"It's indicative of the Howard government's failure to take climate change seriously that  their Immigration Department has done no analysis of the possible impact on migration to  Australia as a result of climate change," Senator Nettle said.

Senator Nettle has questioned the Minister and the Department of Immigration at the last  two Senate Estimates hearings about the impact of climate change on migration to  Australia, and on both occasions the department has admitted to having done no work on  this issue.

"We know that the Pacific Island nation of Tuvalu has an agreement with New Zealand to  take refugees from that nation because of sea level rise due to climate change, but Australia  has so far refused to help.

"It is cruel for the government to wait until Pacific Islands go underwater because of rising  sea levels from climate change before formulating an appropriate response. They should be  planning now.

"The 'Stern Report', amongst many others, indicates the high likelihood of large scale  people movement as a result of climate change. Australia will be affected by these  movements and we need to take this impact seriously.

"Every government department should be planning for the impact of climate change rather  than being hamstrung by the government's flat earth scepticism on the issue."
