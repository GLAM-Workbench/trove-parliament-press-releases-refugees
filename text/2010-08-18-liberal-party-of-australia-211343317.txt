E&OE……………………….…………………………………………………………………

LYNDAL CURTIS:

Tony Abbott, welcome to AM.

TONY ABBOTT:

Nice to be with you Lyndal.

LYNDAL CURTIS:

There are lots of polls out today and as we heard, resources being thrown at marginal seats but what are you  being told? What’s your feeling about how many seats you’ll win on Saturday?

TONY ABBOTT:

I’m here in Rockhampton and you know, a young man died in a roof in Rockhampton because of Labor’s  disastrous pink batts policy. The mining tax is really a dagger aimed at the prosperity of regional  Queensland. Labor’s attempt to lock up so many coastal areas with these marine protected areas is really  worrying recreational fishermen, as well as charter operators and other people who make a living on the sea.  So, I’m just looking at the field evidence Lyndal. The field evidence is that this has been a very bad  Government which deserves to get kicked out.

LYNDAL CURTIS:

I’d like to ask you about your mantra about waste, debt, taxes and boats. Another boat’s arrived carrying 50  passengers off Christmas Island. How soon after you come in, if you win on Saturday, will the boat arrivals  stop?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, Lyndal, as you know, on day one I’d pick up the phone to the President of Nauru and within weeks we  could have an offshore processing centre open on Nauru. That will be a very important signal to the people  smugglers that you’re now out of business. So, I think within a matter of weeks we can start to make a very  big difference there and certainly we can start to end the waste from day one. There wouldn’t be any more

so-called Education Revolution funding except money that went directly to schools because we know that  the schools wouldn’t waste it the way the state education department bureaucrats have.

LYNDAL CURTIS:

Do you think any waste at all is acceptable in government?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think, Lyndal, the public know how hard it is to make a dollar, particularly if you’re in small business,  particularly if you’re retired. Every dollar counts and the spectacle of the Government being cavalier or  flippant with public money, I just think really revolts people. So, waste is never justified. It just isn’t and the  fact that the Prime Minister rather arrogantly says that despite everything we now know about the school  hall programme, she’d do it all again the same way, I think shows really that this mob are not fit for office.

LYNDAL CURTIS:

You’re setting up an Office of Due Diligence, or you want to inside your department that you’d have as  Prime Minister, also a parliamentary budgetary office. These are functions already performed elsewhere by  the Departments of Finance and Treasury and by the Audit Office. Isn’t it waste to have extra layers of  bureaucracy? Why not just improve the ones that exist?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think the parliamentary budget office is very important if there’s going to be proper scrutiny of government  spending and I think the Office of Due Diligence is going to look at these programmes before they get into  trouble rather than, as the Australian National Audit Office does, look at these programmes after they get  into trouble. If there’d be more anticipation, if there’d been more foresight, we wouldn’t have had the waste  and tragically the deaths in the home insulation programme. If there’d been more anticipation and foresight  and more hands-on management of the school halls programme and more hands-on management by Julia  Gillard herself, we wouldn’t have had the rip-off after rip-off that we’ve seen there.

LYNDAL CURTIS:

Do you have a timetable for paying off the debt?

TONY ABBOTT:

We’re going to announce later today, Lyndal, exactly how much lower debt would be under the Coalition,  exactly how much higher surpluses would be under the Coalition so take it from me, Lyndal, debt will  always be less, spending will always be less under the Coalition and you know, we don’t believe in getting  back to surplus by whacking on new taxes. We believe in getting back to surplus by trying to rein in  wasteful government spending.

LYNDAL CURTIS:

Can you say how much bigger your surplus would be?

TONY ABBOTT:

I’m not going to pre-empt the announcement that Joe Hockey and Andrew Robb are going to make later  today.

LYNDAL CURTIS:

Will that announcement include a timetable for paying off the debt?

TONY ABBOTT:

As I said, we’re going to talk, we will give you precise figures, what debt and deficit we expect to be under  us and it will be a vastly better situation when it comes to getting rid of debt and deficit under us than under  the Government.

LYNDAL CURTIS:

What do you do if the United States and Europe have a double-dip recession and Chinese demand falls, the  tax receipts to Australia fall as the did during the global financial crisis. Won’t you then have to look at  possibly going into debt?

TONY ABBOTT:

Plainly, if the world changes we have to respond accordingly. But the point I make is that we will be in a  much weaker position to respond to any new international crisis because of the spending spree that this  Government has been on. The Government likes to boast about its economic credentials. It was only able to  do what it did and as you know, I think it did too much too soon, but it was only able to do what it did  because of the reforms of the previous Government, particularly the fiscal strength that it inherited from the  Howard-Costello Government. Now, this mob have turned a $20 billion surplus into a $57 billion deficit.  They’ve turned a $60 billion net asset position into a $90 billion net debt position. They’re borrowing more  than $100 million a day, every single day. This is weakening the long-term strength of our country, Lyndal  and this means that if there is another international crisis, we’re not going to be nearly as well-placed to deal  with it as we were before.

LYNDAL CURTIS:

So it’s not the case that debt in itself going into deficit is not acceptable but it’s possible that that could  happen if the world turns bad again, if the economy, world economy goes bad again?

TONY ABBOTT:

Lyndal, wasting money is never acceptable. I mean, spending a quarter of a million dollars on school halls  for schools that are going to close, that’s never acceptable.

LYNDAL CURTIS:

But you’re not opposed to deficits, per se.

TONY ABBOTT:

But the point I’m trying to make is that it’s what you do with the money that matters and giving gymnasiums  to schools that want halls and halls to schools that want gymnasiums, building halls that aren’t necessarily  what schools want when they’ve got libraries that are falling down around their ears, this is not sensible  government spending and yet this is what we got from Julia Gillard. I mean, the school hall programme has  been one of the most wasteful programmes in Australia’s history. She couldn’t properly manage a $16  billion school hall programme. Now she wants to be in charge of a $350 billion economy. It doesn’t make  sense to put someone who’s failed in small things, in charge of big things.

LYNDAL CURTIS:

You promised to end Labor’s taxes but you don’t often mention your own levy for paid parental leave. The  Government says there’s a hole in your figures. You’ve said the levy will raise $3 billion but a matching cut  in company tax will only cost $2 billion. Is there a hole in your figures?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, I just think that this is a Government which couldn’t even tell you accurately what its mining tax  would raise, so I completely dispute their figures.

LYNDAL CURTIS:

So will your levy raise as much as your company tax cut will cost?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, all of our costings are being independently verified and those costing, as well, will be released by Joe  Hockey and Andrew Robb today. The point I make, Lyndal, is that paid parental leave, it’s a visionary social  change. It’s an important economic reform. I am proud to be the first major political leader to promise this  very important social and economic reform. I think the Labor Party, frankly, are embarrassed that we’ve  stolen a march on them here. A whole lot of people who, if the Labor Party did this, would be cheering, are  very sour and sucking on lemons over this because the Coalition’s had the good sense to do it. It’s got to be  paid for. The best way to pay for it is with this modest levy on the profits of big business. Now, I don’t  apologise for that. I’m pleased that we are giving the families, the women of Australia, this important  reform.

LYNDAL CURTIS:

Finally, both you and Julia Gillard will be at a community forum. Are you happy for her to speak second?

TONY ABBOTT:

I’m just pleased that she’s going to front up at last and face questions from the people of Queensland. It was  good enough to face up to the people of western Sydney last week and I think the people of Queensland  deserve no less. I was there with bells on from the first moment the Courier Mail said that they wanted to  have this forum and the Prime Minister is being dragged kicking and screaming, so to speak, to the forum,  but at least it seems she’s coming.

LYNDAL CURTIS:

Tony Abbott, thank you very much for your time.

TONY ABBOTT:

Thanks Lyndal.
