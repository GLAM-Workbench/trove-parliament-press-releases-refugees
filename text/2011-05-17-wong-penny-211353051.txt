TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW - ABC NEWS 24 WITH LYNDAL CURTIS

SUBJECT:  BUDGET 2011-12; CARBON PRICE.

E  & O E - PROOF ONLY

CURTIS: Penny Wong, welcome to News 24.

WONG: Good to be here.

CURTIS: Senator, the Reserve Bank statement, it notes that there is potential for significant  fiscal consolidation over the next couple of years. But it’s also pretty clear that it thinks  inflation will go up. Are higher interest rates simply the price you have to pay for a stronger  economy?

WONG: Obviously interest rates are a matter for the independent Reserve Bank but the  Government is very conscious of inflationary pressures. That’s what happens when you get  this sort of wave of investment in our economy and that’s why our budget focuses both on  ensuring we come back to surplus, get back in the black - which is about not compounding  those risks - but also that we invest in more capacity. And that’s what the workforce  participation and skills aspects of the budget are about. Let’s expand the capacity of the  economy.

CURTIS: But that will take some time won’t it to get people into those jobs and the ahead of  that, there’s the potential for extra pressure on wages as the mining industry sucks up more  jobs. And other companies might find they have to pay their workers more simply to keep  them. That will add to inflationary pressures which feed into interest rates won’t it?

WONG: As I said, when you’ve got a wave of investment the size that Australia is  experiencing, there’s obviously going to be price pressures. There’s going to be the  economy pushing up against capacity, and that’s why we’ve got to do what we’re doing. It’s  why coming back to surplus is so important. And the Reserve Bank noted that. It noted that  the fiscal consolidation that’s going to be occurring.

We’re delivering a very fast Budget turnaround. We’re going, I think it’s 3.8 per cent of GDP  over two years. That is a very fast turnaround and it’s the right thing to do. To not  compound these price pressures.

CURTIS: Is there little else that the Government can do if you bring your budget back to  surplus. There’s really nothing else you can do to try and mitigate any pressure coming  from wage rises to keep households saving?

WONG: You can do what the Government is doing which is to try and expand the capacity  of the economy by increasing the skills of your labour force so they have the relevant skills  for employers and getting more people into work. You can do that.

But the most important thing that we can do and that the parliament can do is bring the  budget back to surplus. And this is where other parties in the Parliament, this is where the  Opposition really have some responsibility as well. We’ve put forward a Budget that brings  the budget back to surplus. It’s now a matter for Mr Abbott and Mr Hockey to show that they  will support that and if they don’t support any of the Government’s measures, to put forward  their own savings. So far, they haven’t done so.

CURTIS: But the Opposition says it wants to see your legislation before it decides which  way it’s going to vote. Isn’t that a reasonable prospect?

WONG: That is yet another cop out from an Opposition whose record when it comes to the  economy is extremely poor. Remember Mr Abbott, Mr Hockey, Mr Robb - $11 billion black  hole in their election costings.

Mr Hockey last week, or the week before, boasting that he would bring the budget to  surplus earlier. Since then, not a single savings measure. Not a single savings measure  and apparently, not happy with a range of the Government’s savings. Well if you’re not  happy with the Government’s measures, you’ve got to put up your own. Either that, or  you’re going to wreck the surplus. It would be economically irresponsible for the Opposition  to wreck the surplus, so it’s incumbent upon Mr Hockey tomorrow when he addresses the  National Press Club, as the shadow Treasurer, to say how he would bring the budget back  to surplus.

CURTIS: But isn’t that an unrealistic ask from Opposition? I’ve gone back through a few  budget replies over the last few years. Kevin Rudd in 2007 outlined more spending than  saving, Mark Latham in 2004 had no new funding details and promised a tax plan closer to  that election. Kim Beazley in 1999 was critical of the budget. He made a pitch to middle  Australia in 2006 with no spending cuts. And Simon Crean delivered a budget reply in 2003  that wasn’t fully funded. Aren’t you asking of the Opposition more than you were prepared  to deliver in Opposition?

WONG: Well I don’t accept all of the examples you’ve just put to me because I can also  recall being in Opposition and having to make sure any new spending was offset or that we  could fund it.

The point is here; If Mr Abbott wants to back the Government’s budget, so be it, that’s good.  We’d like him to. If he doesn’t then it’s incumbent on him to show how else he would bring  the budget back to surplus.  I mean that is the key economic test for parties of government  in this timeframe: how do you bring a budget back to surplus when the economy is  experiencing the sort of price pressures to which you’ve referred. We’ve shown how we  want to do it. Tony Abbott should either back that or show how he would do it.

CURTIS: Before the budget was delivered, Julia Gillard told the caucus that it was an  opportunity to broaden the Government’s agenda. But we’re back talking about carbon tax  and asylum seekers. Are you putting too much faith in a budget to deliver you the bounce  you need?

WONG: We want to talk about all the things which are important to the country’s future. And  I think the point the Prime Minister is making is a very sound point, which is the country’s  future is about many things and one of the things that is central to our future is the  economy. And we’ve put forward our plans to ensure this economy continues to grow  strongly and sustainably and that we bring the budget back to surplus. That’s a very  important issue for now and for the future.

CURTIS: One of the plans we haven’t seen yet is the carbon tax, is what the carbon price  will be and how is it going to rise. Is the political problem for you that unlike the GST, which  had a fixed rate which hasn’t changed, the carbon price will increase over time and Tony  Abbott can warn that whatever carbon price is set come July, that will go up.

WONG: Isn’t the political problem here that Tony Abbott just wants to be relentlessly  negative when it comes to action on climate change? And that makes a tough reform even  tougher. We know that. It’s very easy for Tony Abbott to run around the country saying no,  stirring up fear, and making all sorts of accusations which are false. But we know this is the  right thing to do for the economy.

If we think four, ten years from now, I’m sure Australians would want an economy which  produces less pollution. That’s why we want to price carbon and we’re going to go through  this process methodically and carefully. Of course we know that Tony Abbott will continue  his campaign. But we’re going to continue to advocate for this reform and we’ll put out the  details when they have been finalised as is appropriate.

CURTIS: You’re putting a lot of store - the Government’s putting a lot of store - in its  household compensation measures to get people on board. As the carbon price rises  should the household compensation rise as well?

WONG: These are all details that Greg is working on together with other Ministers and also  through the Multi Party Committee. And these are all details which will be addressed in due  course. But obviously the Government’s made clear the priority we attach to assisting  households.

CURTIS: Penny Wong, thank you very much for your time.

WONG: Good to speak with you.
