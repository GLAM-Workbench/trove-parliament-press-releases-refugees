Manus refugee in critical condition,  independent medical team must investigate

Reports that a 24 year old Iranian refugee has been evacuated from Manus Island in a critical  condition are extremely concerning and an independent team must be allowed to investigate,  the Australian Greens have said.

“Our thoughts are with this young man who simply shouldn’t have been put in this position,” the  Greens’ immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.

“An expert medical team must be sent to Manus Island immediately so that they can carry out  an independent investigation into the conditions there.

“This is the just the latest in a long line of unnecessary tragedies that have come out of the  Manus Island detention camp.

“There is a toxic culture of abuse and neglect in Australia’s offshore detention centres and they  must be closed.”
