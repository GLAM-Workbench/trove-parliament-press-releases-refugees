INTERVIEW WITH KARL STEFANOVIC - TODAY SHOW, NINE NETWORK -  WEDNESDAY 12 MAY, 2010

12th May 2010

E&OE………………………………………………………………………………………

Subject: Budget 2010



KARL STEFANOVIC:

Joining us now with his response to Wayne Swan’s Budget is the Shadow Treasurer Joe  Hockey.  What do you know Joe?

JOE HOCKEY:

Good morning Karl.  Good morning Lisa.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

Restrained and responsible Budget is what they are calling it - and also our family there in  Brisbane were calling it just that.  Is that what we needed right now?

JOE HOCKEY:

Well it is what we needed, but they are not delivering.  It is a wish and a hope and a prayer  that in three years time they will deliver a surplus of just $1 billion out of what will be a $350  billion expenditure in that year.

Karl, at the moment they are borrowing over $700 million a week and they are going to do it  for the next three years to fund their existing promises.  They have got a $40 billion deficit  this year and they have got reckless spending.  They are spending a billion dollars to try and  fix up their asylum seeker mess.  They are spending a billion dollars to fix up the pink batt  program.  Kevin Rudd promised no more bureaucrats for his health plan.  He is spending half  a billion dollars on a new bureaucracy.

This is not the stuff of a responsible Government.     KARL STEFANOVIC:

We are debt free within three years.  What is wrong with that?



JOE HOCKEY:

No, we are not debt free in three years.  This is the thing.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

We have a surplus in three years.

JOE HOCKEY:

That’s right they are promising to get the Budget into surplus in three years.  A $1 billion  surplus.  They are leaving us with a debt of over $100 billion.  Over $100 billion plus the $26  billion they are going to spend on their NBN roll out.  You see, they have got to run surpluses  for years and years to pay off the debt they are leaving us and they inherited zero debt.   In  fact they inherited $40 billion in the bank plus a $20 billion surplus.

The other thing is Karl - this is a key point - the mining tax they are introducing is going to  hit every family in Australia.  No one believes that BHP and Rio are just going to hand $9  billion of profits to Kevin Rudd.  They are going to pass it on in higher steel prices, higher  brick prices, higher fertiliser prices, the price of coal is going to go up, therefore electricity  prices are going to go up.  There is nothing in the Budget to address that.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

Laurie Oakes has tweeted.  I was reading his ‘tweetering’ last night, because I don’t have  much else to do once the kids are in bed.  He said “Last Budget night Hockey blasted  Treasury as far too optimistic.  Tonight he says Treasury figures last year were far too  pessimistic.” You’re all over the shop Joe.

JOE HOCKEY:

No.  Well that’s Laurie’s interpretation and Laurie is wrong.  I will tell you why because last  year the Government was spending so much money, that it was incredibly hard to believe the  out years, their forecasts of economic growth, were real.  What turned out is that the  recession never happened - but they were spending recession levels of money.  This year  they are spending $26 billion more than they did last year, and yet they expect us to believe  they are going to deliver a surplus in three years time.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

We just shouldn’t have a surplus in three years? Is that what you’re saying?

JOE HOCKEY:

Well no, I’m saying you have got to have it real.  You have got to make it real Karl.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

How would you make it real Joe?

JOE HOCKEY:

Well you make hard decisions.  You will see us make some statements about hard decisions  over the next few weeks.  They will be hard - but I’ll tell you what: the most important thing  for us at the moment is to get the budget into surplus and to pay off Labor’s debt.  If we do  not do that then events that are unpredictable - like what is happening in Greece and other  things - will have an impact on us in the future.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

The Treasurer along with some media commentators today - who shall remain nameless but  they are out there - are saying that this budget will have a positive effect on interests rates -  in that it will have downward pressure on interests rates and inflation.  Do you believe that to  be the case?

JOE HOCKEY:

No, because the 2.5% that they are predicting will be the inflationary impact over the next  few years is considered, by a number of commentators, as ambitiously low.  The band that  the Reserve Bank looks at is 2-3% - there is no wriggle room in that.  I think what you will  see is with the Government introducing a new $9 billion a year mining tax - prices will go up  Karl.  Because those big businesses are going to pass it on to everyday Australians in the  supermarket, in electricity prices, and that will push up inflation and that will push up interest  rates.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

How high will they go then Joe?

JOE HOCKEY:

I don’t know.  But I tell you what for a small business out there now they are paying 11% - as  of today 11% for an unsecured overdraft.  Many homeowners are paying well above the cash  rate of the Reserve Bank.  It is my greatest concern - interest rates and the cost of living for  Australians - and there is nothing in this budget to address it.



KARL STEFANOVIC:

What would interest rates be under a Coalition Government Joe?

JOE HOCKEY:

They will always be lower than under Labor, Karl.  I promise you

KARL STEFANOVIC:

Joe Hockey, good to talk to you.

JOE HOCKEY:

Well you know what?  We are not always popular.  When we are in government we are not  always popular.  But I’ll tell you what we do, we do the right things when it comes to  spending money.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

Alright lots of people watching at home this morning, Today@nine.com.au - let us know  what you think about Joe’s response.  Appreciate it Joe.  Good to see you.

JOE HOCKEY:

Thanks Karl.  Good to see you.
