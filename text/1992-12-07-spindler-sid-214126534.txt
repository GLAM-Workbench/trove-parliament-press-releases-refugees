IMMIGRATION MINISTER NOT ABOVE LAW

The Minister's attacks on an individual decision by Mr Justice  Einfeld is a smokescreen to camouflage his attempt to subvert  basic legal rights of people appearing before Australian Courts,  according to the Australian Democrats.

"The Government's Migration Reform Bill seeks to exclude breaches  of natural justice, unreasonableness, bad faith, irrelevant  considerations and perceived bias when the Federal Court is  reviewing Immigration decisions.

"It is an outrageous attempt to create a class of people who  would be denied elementary justice before our courts ,in direct  breach of international law," Democrat Ethnic Affairs

Spokesperson, Senator Sid Spindler, said today.

"The Australian Democrats will be moving amendments to remove the  offensive sections and I am counting on the Coalition Parties'  support in this basic human rights matter. '

"The High Court's obligation to review government decisions is  guaranteed by the Constitution (pi.75) and people denied justice  before the Federal Court would go directly to the High Court,  causing overload and considerably higher costs for themselves and

for the taxpayer, as pointed out by the Chief Justice in his  letter to the Attorney General.

"Further, the High Court is expected to hand down within days its  judgement in Lim v. Commonwealth concerning Cambodian asylum  seekers and in trying to ram through this legislation today the  Minister may find he has to amend it tomorrow.

"The Government should stop this whole shabby exercise, unworthy  of a civilised nation, and pull the bill off or accept the

Australian Democrats' amendments," Senator Spindler concluded.
