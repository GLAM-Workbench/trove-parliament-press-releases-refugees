ILLEGAL BOAT PEOPLE RETURNED TO CHINA

Â

The 60 illegal Chinese entrants who recently arrived at Scoffs Head 
Beach near Coffs Harbour have been returned to China, the Minister for 
Immig ration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock, said today.

Â

Making the announcement, the Mr Ruddock said the boat 
arrival was one of the most sophisticated Australia had seen.

Â

“These people were, sadly, well and truly duped.

Â

“In their bid to enter Australia illegally, those 
on board were enticed by the - organisers to pay around $26,000 each 
— many times more than the $3,800 paid by those who arrived on Holloways 
Beach in Cairns in March.

Â

“The organisers promised those on board they would 
be easily able to repay the fare once they got work in Australia.

Â

“They risked their life on a journey that was never 
going to work. This is why it is imperative we return illegal boat people 
as quickly as we can, so that others will see that such a trip is not 
only dangerous, but futile.

Â

“We need people to realise that the rumours peddled 
by smugglers, that people who arrive in Australia illegally by boat 
are allowed to stay and work, are not true.

Â

“It is for this reason that it is crucial that Australian 
Labor Party support the Government’s Judicial Review Bill to restrict 
the ability of unlawful arrivals to pursue vexatious claims through 
the courts.

Â

“Individuals considering such unlawful entry need 
to understand they can not remain in this country for years pursing 
endless court actions and appeals”.

Â

The Minister said that the high level of organisation 
associated with this boat had not been seen before in Australia.

Â

“A different route was taken. The vessel sailed 
in international waters east of Papua New Guinea to avoid detection 
by entering Australian waters.

Â

“The east coast destination and level of fares were 
also distinctive”.

Â

To address the issues presented by recent boat arrivals, 
the Government has undertaken a number of initiatives including the 
establishment of a top-level task force to review coastal surveillance 
activities.

Â

This task force is being chaired by the Secretary 
of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet and comprises other 
key agency heads, including the Secretary of the Department of Immigration 
and Multicultural Affairs.

Â

“The task force will report its findings in June. 
In addition, we continue to pursue stronger cooperation amongst countries 
in the region.

Â

“I was pleased to lead an Australian delegation 
at the Thai Symposium on illegal immigration in Bangkok last month.

Â

“I was delighted that the symposium adopted a series 
of concrete measures to improve regional action to combat an illegal 
trade which exploits vulnerable people, particularly women and children.

Â

“At the Symposium, I also met with His Excellency, 
Wu Donghe, China’s Assistant Foreign Minister, to discuss further 
cooperation between the two countries to stop the illegal arrival of 
Chinese boat people.

Â

“China has informed us on a number of occasions of vessels they  
have intercepted leaving the country attempting to travel here.

Â

“It is crucial we continue effective intelligence 
gathering on the most recent boat arrivals in an effort to establish 
the people involved and the way in which such operations are organised.

Â

“It is also imperative that we break this culture 
of illegal immigration to Australia that seems to exist in certain parts 
of China, particularly Fujian Province.

Â

“Australia has a long-standing relationship with 
China and has received excellent cooperation from the Chinese Government 
in its determination to combat the illegal smuggling of people”.
