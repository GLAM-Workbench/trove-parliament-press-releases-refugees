TERRI BUTLER, SHADOW PARLIAMENTARY SECRETARY TO THE LEADER  OF THE OPPOSITION: IÃ¢ÂÂm Terri Butler IÃ¢ÂÂm the Federal Member for Griffith and itÃ¢ÂÂs  just wonderful to be here at Southbank today, this beautiful part of my electorate of  Griffith. IÃ¢ÂÂve got with me Tanya Plibersek the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, and  Shelley Argent who runs PFLAG, Parents and Friends of Lesbians and Gays. And  itÃ¢ÂÂs just such a pleasure to welcome you both and to particularly welcome Tanya  whoÃ¢ÂÂs going to say a few words. So thanks very much.

TANYA PLIBERSEK, DEPUTY LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION: Thanks very  much Terri. ItÃ¢ÂÂs always such a pleasure to be here in Brisbane but particularly with  my friend and colleague Terri Butler whoÃ¢ÂÂs been doing such a fantastic job in  Canberra representing the people of her electorate. IÃ¢ÂÂve been in Queensland for the  last couple of days, in Brisbane for the last couple of days and itÃ¢ÂÂs been extraordinary  to hear the issues that people are raising with me. The thing thatÃ¢ÂÂs been most  extraordinary is the way that the people of Brisbane have gone off Malcolm Turnbull  in recent times. WeÃ¢ÂÂve got, of course, this terrible event in Townsville where it looks  like 550 more people will lose their jobs because of the problems of Queensland  Nickel, and Bill ShortenÃ¢ÂÂs up there today talking to the workers whoÃ¢ÂÂll be affected. But

people in Brisbane all have connections with those people in Townsville who are at  risk of losing their jobs and, in fact, the whole of the city of Townsville will be affected  if these job losses go ahead. And people are saying to me, everywhere I go, “well,  whatÃ¢ÂÂs Malcolm TurnbullÃ¢ÂÂs plan?”, “WhatÃ¢ÂÂs Malcolm TurnbullÃ¢ÂÂs plan for jobs in  Queensland?”, “WhatÃ¢ÂÂs his plan for the economy?”, “ThereÃ¢ÂÂs no clarity about the tax  proposals heÃ¢ÂÂll take to the federal budget”. The only thing that they know about  Malcolm Turnbull is that heÃ¢ÂÂs committed to continuing on with the vicious cuts that  Tony Abbott announced in the 2014 budget. So $12 billion cut from the Queensland  health system, more than $6 billion cut from QueenslandÃ¢ÂÂs schools. One of things, of  course, that theyÃ¢ÂÂre disappointed about with Malcolm Turnbull - itÃ¢ÂÂs a list - I mean,  he said that the NBN would be better, faster, cheaper. And itÃ¢ÂÂs slower, more  expensive and not working for many of the people who have seen the NBN roll out in  their areas. TheyÃ¢ÂÂre devastated that someone who said he believed in climate  change and strong action on climate change isnÃ¢ÂÂt proceeding with the sort of policies  that would actually make a difference when it comes to climate change. One of the  most heartbreaking things for many Australians is they thought that Malcolm Turnbull  would actually be a bit better than Tony Abbott when it came to marriage equality.  And instead, what we see, is that Malcolm Turnbull has adopted all of Tony AbbottÃ¢ÂÂs  policies: the cuts to health and education; the inaction on climate change; the cuts to  the ABC and SBS. And now heÃ¢ÂÂs adopted the policy of a $160 million wasteful and  divisive plebiscite. There are families all over Australia who actually donÃ¢ÂÂt want their  kids growing up in an environment where theyÃ¢ÂÂre being told that being same-sex  attracted, gay, lesbian, bisexual is a problem, thereÃ¢ÂÂs something wrong with it. And  thereÃ¢ÂÂs a whole lot of kids already growing up in families with two mums or two dads  who shouldnÃ¢ÂÂt have to listen to months of being told that thereÃ¢ÂÂs something wrong  with their families. IÃ¢ÂÂm going to hand…[pause to wait for nearby traffic noise to  stop]…Shelley Argent has done a fantastic campaign for many, many years,  supporting same-sex couples, but most particularly saying that parents and friends  whoÃ¢ÂÂve got a kid whoÃ¢ÂÂs growing up gay or lesbian, bi-sexual, love their family  members, want to support them and most particularly want them not to be  discriminated against in our society and not to be discriminated against in our laws.  And ShelleyÃ¢ÂÂs got some very exciting news today, sheÃ¢ÂÂs launching a new book and  sheÃ¢ÂÂs going to tell you all about it.

ARGENT: Good morning, what weÃ¢ÂÂve been doing is, or what IÃ¢ÂÂve been doing for  many years, is lobbying the government and the politicians about marriage equality.  And when I first started there was the conversation about “theyÃ¢ÂÂll want to marry the  TV or the dog”, but now weÃ¢ÂÂve, fortunately weÃ¢ÂÂve moved on from that, and now the  two main concerns are the tradition of marriage, and what about the children? So  weÃ¢ÂÂve come to the conclusion that the children that theyÃ¢ÂÂre talking about are our  grandchildren.  And so what weÃ¢ÂÂve done is weÃ¢ÂÂve put together a brag book, and itÃ¢ÂÂs  all about - and theyÃ¢ÂÂre genuine photos, theyÃ¢ÂÂre not mock-ups - genuine photos of  grandparents with their grandchildren from same sex couples. And the message is  that these grandchildren, our children, are fine. They are just the same as anybody  elseÃ¢ÂÂs grandchildren or children, theyÃ¢ÂÂre loved equally, theyÃ¢ÂÂre no better, theyÃ¢ÂÂre no  worse, theyÃ¢ÂÂre just children that are loved. And itÃ¢ÂÂs also important I think when you  look at the booklet, that you can see really fantastic little children and the love that  theyÃ¢ÂÂre getting, not only from their parents but also their grandparents and extended  family.  Really, there is no need to be concerned about the children.  And that is our  message - donÃ¢ÂÂt worry about the children.  And if you are concerned about the  children, really, you need to allow marriage equality and you should be encouraging  a free vote, because if you have a free vote thereÃ¢ÂÂs less stress on the family, less

questions, less mental health issues...just, itÃ¢ÂÂs just difficult.  And even for me, as a  parent of a gay son, I find it really insulting to have my child and his morals and  ethics questioned by people who donÃ¢ÂÂt even know him.  And they donÃ¢ÂÂt care. And if  marriage equality comes in, you know, the people who were against it, they wonÃ¢ÂÂt  lose, but my son will gain.  And if itÃ¢ÂÂs prevented, the people who are against it, they  wonÃ¢ÂÂt gain but my son will lose. And thatÃ¢ÂÂs wrong. And so this is why we want a free  vote, not a plebiscite.  We donÃ¢ÂÂt want this money wasted.  There are so much more  that the government could do with this money than to waste it on a plebiscite  because theyÃ¢ÂÂre not game enough to stand up and take a little bit of heat from a few  of the opponents, but they would know theyÃ¢ÂÂre doing whatÃ¢ÂÂs right, not whatÃ¢ÂÂs easiest.

JOURNALIST: How do you feel youÃ¢ÂÂve been going getting traction in the community  with the booklet like this?

ARGENT: Well I think this is just a reminder, because we already know that the vast  majority of Australians want marriage equality. They are either in favour of it or  theyÃ¢ÂÂre past caring, and the number of people that say to me Ã¢ÂÂwhat is wrong?  Why  are they taking so long?Ã¢ÂÂ And these are people I donÃ¢ÂÂt even know, and theyÃ¢ÂÂre  standing giving me a lecture on what the government should be doing. And itÃ¢ÂÂs just  silly. I really donÃ¢ÂÂt know what the governmentÃ¢ÂÂs fearing.

JOURNALIST: With the review of the Safe Schools programme expected out  today…

ARGENT: Yes?

JOURNALIST: …if it is trimmed back or cut, how would you feel about that?

ARGENT: Oh, that would be a disaster, because the Safe Schools programme is  fantastic.  YouÃ¢ÂÂre hearing all this scaremongering about how itÃ¢ÂÂs encouraging children  to be gay, or itÃ¢ÂÂs encouraging children to do whatever…you know, itÃ¢ÂÂs nonsense,  absolute nonsense.  And itÃ¢ÂÂs a programme that is voluntary, itÃ¢ÂÂs not compulsory.  ItÃ¢ÂÂs  a programme thatÃ¢ÂÂs given to the teachers and the staff to help them with the children  who may identify as trans, or are lesbian and gay. And itÃ¢ÂÂs basically also for high  school children, or the high school teachers to talk to the children about diversity and  difference.  But itÃ¢ÂÂs the scaremongering, and that is what is really wrong, and the  groups that are doing that should really be ashamed of themselves.

JOURNALIST: An outcome that might happen is that there could be tweaks made.   Is there any scope for slight changes?

ARGENT: Well, IÃ¢ÂÂd want to know what the change was first, and thatÃ¢ÂÂs the thing.  IÃ¢ÂÂd  want to know what that change was before I commented.

JOURNALIST: Ms Plibersek can I ask you…

PLIBERSEK:  Yeah sure

JOURNALIST: …about Safe Schools as well?

PLIBERSEK:  Yeah you can.  Well, we know Malcolm Turnbull made a deal on a  plebiscite instead of a vote in the Parliament when it came to marriage equality.  He

made that deal to become Prime Minister - he sold out to the right wing of the Liberal  Party a belief that he has had publicly and privately for many years. What really  surprises me as that heÃ¢ÂÂs jumped on the bandwagon when it comes to the Safe  Schools Coalition.  This is basically a programme saying that kids should not be  bullied for their sexuality at school. It amazes me that anyone would be arguing  against an anti-bullying programme.  Now people are saying Ã¢ÂÂwell, what about sexist  bullying? What about racist bullying?Ã¢ÂÂ - there are programmes for other types of  bullying.  There should be no bullying in our schools.  Every child should feel safe  and accepted in their school.  We know that young people who are same-sex  attracted or transgender are 6 times more likely to commit suicide than the rest of the  community.  We know that 80% of those kids say that they havenÃ¢ÂÂt always felt safe at  their school.  ItÃ¢ÂÂs completely wrong for those individual kids to be frightened if theyÃ¢ÂÂre  going to school, frightened when they get home about what their friends are saying  about them on the internet - you know, the kids are bullied 24 hours a day, 7 days a  week these days - it doesnÃ¢ÂÂt stop at the school gate.  And of course it doesnÃ¢ÂÂt just  affect the psychology of these young people, with elevated risks of depression and  alienation, but of course it affects their school work as well.  Nobody can be learning  properly at school when theyÃ¢ÂÂre fearing for their safety or fearing exclusion or bullying  at school.  So it is deeply distressing to have a Prime Minister - sure, heÃ¢ÂÂs sold out  on marriage equality - he could have made a stand on bullying of children at  schools.  He hasnÃ¢ÂÂt done that.

JOURNALIST: Just quickly on Clive Palmer, what do you make of his  businessmanship? WeÃ¢ÂÂve got his resort at the Sunshine Coast in dire straits now,  Queensland Nickel.  What do you make of him as a businessman and an MP?

PLIBERSEK: Well IÃ¢ÂÂd say itÃ¢ÂÂs for other people to judge his business success.  When  you look at more than 200 people whoÃ¢ÂÂve already lost their jobs in Townsville and  another 550 jobs really on the line today; as you say the resort that he took over, that  seemed to be a going concern when he took it over, it doesnÃ¢ÂÂt seem to be such a  going concern now. But itÃ¢ÂÂs for others to judge his business acumen.  IÃ¢ÂÂd say that our  concern has to be for the workers today, in Townsville, who are facing the loss of  their jobs.  We believe that the Government should be doing much more to ensure  that they keep the jobs they have or they are smoothly transition to other work.   Labor has announced a Townsville Stadium that will create 700 jobs in its  construction for a start.  But this isnÃ¢ÂÂt an issue that the Federal Government can  wash its hands of.  If you take hundreds of jobs like this out of a city like Townsville,  itÃ¢ÂÂs not just the people who lose their jobs and their immediate family that are  affected.  ItÃ¢ÂÂs the whole Townsville economy, the whole city of Townsville suffers  when these jobs are taken out of the local economy.  So it canÃ¢ÂÂt be a hands-off  approach, it canÃ¢ÂÂt be the same sort of turning a blind eye that we saw from the  Federal Government as the car industries have closed down in Victoria and South  Australia. We really need to see some leadership from the Federal Government  here.

JOURNALIST: Just got a couple of questions on Iran from our Canberra office. Are  you comfortable with the GovernmentÃ¢ÂÂs diplomatic engagement with Iran?

PLIBERSEK: Well I certainly think we need to have diplomatic engagement with  countries right across the world, whether we agree with all of the things that their  governments do or not. Iranian culture is ancient, Persia was one of the great  empires of the world and Iranians today are still proud of that history.  And despite

the fact that theyÃ¢ÂÂve had an oppressive Government for many years, there are  intelligent, hardworking people in Iran who continue to fight for democracy and  continue to fight for a government that doesnÃ¢ÂÂt trample their human rights in the way  the Iranian Government does.  What amazes me is that the Foreign Minister has  been so quick to welcome engagement with Iran, we suspect because she hopes  that 9000 Iranian asylum seekers will be returned involuntarily to Iran if the  relationship goes well. And so prepared to turn a blind eye to the anti-American  rhetoric of the Iranian Government, the anti-Israeli rhetoric of the Iranian  Government, to the human rights abuses, where people are locked up for their  sexuality, for following a religion thatÃ¢ÂÂs not approved of by the regime, and most  particularly, for political organisation against an oppressive Government. So yes, we  understand that Iran is an important country in the region.  We will need to work with  Iran on issues like political settlement in Syria, but that does not give us the ability to  turn a blind eye to those human rights abuses and to the continued sponsorship of  the Iranian Government of conflicts in the region where they are funding and arming  groups that are engaged in serious conflict in Yemen, in Syria, and in other countries  across the region.

JOURNALIST: I just have a couple of other quick questions - is there internal  discontent within the Labor Party about Linda BurneyÃ¢ÂÂs preselection?

PLIBERSEK: No, thereÃ¢ÂÂs - we are delighted to be welcoming Linda Burney to the  Labor Party and of course we have very high hopes that she will be elected to the  Federal Parliament whenever Malcolm Turnbull should deign to call an election.   Linda Burney has a long and distinguished career as an activist for Aboriginal  people, as the first teaching graduate from Mitchell College, as someone who has  been a very senior bureaucrat in State Governments, who has been a fantastic  Deputy Leader of the Labor Opposition in the New South Wales Parliament - she  will be an asset to Federal Labor, just as she has been an asset to State Labor, just  as she was an asset to the state bureaucracy before that, just as she has always  been an asset to the fight for indigenous equality in this country.

JOURNALIST: And just finally the PM issued what amounts to be an ultimatum on  holding a double dissolution.  Is it time for Labor to verify its position?

PLIBERSEK: Well, I think our positionÃ¢ÂÂs pretty clear.  We think that the Liberals and  the Greens have done a pretty nasty deal to facilitate a double dissolution election  that they think will benefit the Liberals and the Greens at the expense of the minor  parties.  We see evidence of this across the board in the Senate voting reform  changes that the Greens were so quick to agree with the Liberals on.  TheyÃ¢ÂÂll benefit  Labor and the Liberals and the Greens, but pity help anyone whoÃ¢ÂÂs an independent  or a minor party.  And what really concerns me about this is if you think about the  type of things that will be shoved through a joint sitting of a Parliament after a double  dissolution election.  Yes weÃ¢ÂÂll have industrial relations legislation that takes us back  to the bad old days of Workchoices, but weÃ¢ÂÂll also have many of the things that have  been held up by the Senate, like $100,000 university degrees, like further cuts to  family tax benefit and pensions, shoved through a joint sitting of the Parliament.  The  thing that particularly alarms me is a number of environmental measures that the  Greens say they support, that weÃ¢ÂÂve been able stop in the Senate, the LiberalÃ¢ÂÂs  destroying, will be, we expect to be pushed through a joint sitting of the two Houses  as well.  So all of the things that have been held up by negotiation across the cross- benches - well, a double dissolution means all of them can be passed.
