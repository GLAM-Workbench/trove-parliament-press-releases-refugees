THE HON RICHARD MARLES MP  SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND BORDER  PROTECTION  MEMBER FOR CORIO



E&OE TRANSCRIPT  RADIO INTERVIEW  ABC 774 DRIVE WITH RAFAEL EPSTEIN   THURSDAY, 3 JULY 2014

SUBJECT/S: Scott Morrison’s refusal to comment on reported asylum  seeker vessels.

RAFAEL EPSTEIN: Richard Marles joins us, he is the Shadow  Immigration spokesperson, Richard Marles good afternoon.

RICHARD MARLES: Good afternoon Raf, how are you?

EPSTEIN: Is it legal to assess people in some way at sea do you think?

MARLES: Well if there is any truth to the reports which we have seen in the media  today, there would be really serious concerns about Australia meeting its  international obligations of non-refoulement, in other words returning people to the  country from which they are fleeing and that would go to the question of whether or  not you could seriously assess people in a circumstance where they’re at sea and  presumably the people doing the assessment are elsewhere, I suppose the other  point to make it is unclear to me how people’s individual cases are determined in  that if this is true and I hasten to say if it’s true, it’s hard to see how people are  treated [inaudible] so this is an unacceptable situation that we don’t know what is  going on and there is a real legitimate public interest here because it goes to the  very question of Australia’s international standing.

EPSTEIN: Can I ask you about the international conventions or international  obligations, why do you say ‘serious concerns’ I guess I am trying to pin down  where the ALP stands on this, the Greens, Julian Burnside QC, they are very clear  that it is a breach of international obligations, the Government says it is a very  necessary part of their policies, what does ‘serious concern’ mean?



MARLES: Well the only reason why I am putting it in those terms is because we  don’t know what is going on, and until we do know what is going on it is hard to  give you a concrete answer as to whether or not what has happened is or isn’t  consistent with our international obligations.

EPSTEIN: Isn’t there a principal you can address?

MARLES: The principal is very simple, if people are assessed to be genuinely fleeing  from a place of danger then to return them to that place and directly into the hands  of that place is a clear violation of the refugee convention, it goes to the heart of it.

EPSTEIN: So for you to say it is definitely a breach, you just need to know whether  or not they are being assessed while in the ocean?

MARLES: And the point I am making is I am struggling to understand how a proper  individual assessment, and that is an important point to make, an assessment for  each of the individuals on board can be made or could be made while they are in the  ocean if that is what is going on, now of course the Government confirmed any of  this and what we are seeing is a Government which is really happy to beat its chest  on the good days, but runs for cover when there is inconvenient news in the context  of their political scoreboard and really we need a Minister who is willing to face the  media on the good days and bad to explain the actions of the  Government, because that’s, people actually have a right to know and we have  heard him describe people’s interests as a mere curiosity, I mean that is treating the  public with total contempt, this isn’t a curiosity, it’s not a curiosity to be  concerned about the fate of 150 people, it is actually our right to know what is going  out there.

EPSTEIN: Richard Marles there is a former immigration detention centre  manager who has being quoted by ABC news saying that the idea of processing  asylum seekers on a mother ship at sea was considered by Government agencies in  2012, now I know you had what I like to call a junior foreign affairs portfolio, but do  you know if that is the case, did the ALP or at least did the bureaucracy under the  ALP Government consider doing something similar to what it appears is being done  now?

MARLES: I don’t believe so, if there is any truth to the reports we have seen today  this would represent a huge new step in the way in which the Australian  Government is going about its business and I really do think that it amounts  throwing out the humanitarian rule book in pursuit of protecting a political  scoreboard, I mean that is really what would be going on here. I mean this is not  something that certainly we in Government ever contemplated and there is detail  here that we need to understand which is why we need to hear from the Minister  but I mean the real point here is how do you properly assess each and every  individuals claims when they are on a ship at sea, and if it turns out that some of the  people may have better claims than others, how are they able to be further

investigated and how are those people able to people separated from the pack as  it were, that’s what I am struggling to understand now it may be…

EPSTEIN: I just want to establish the ALP’s position, say there a boats of people  coming, Tamils from India having concerns about Sri Lanka, you would what transfer  them to PNG or Nauru? That would be the ALP’s position?

MARLES: Well yes, and there is a process in place, the Regional Resettlement  Arrangement would allow these people to be put into a facility where their refugee  claims can be assessed in detail and people, you know they might not like offshore  processing but it is playing an important role in terms of saving lives at sea, and  what it would is allow people’s claims to be properly assessed, and what I am  struggling to understand in all of this is firstly why the Minister doesn’t tell us what is  going on, but secondly, given there is a facility which is able to be implemented or  used for a circumstance of this kind, why it is not, the only explanation for that is  because the Government doesn’t want to spoil its political scoreboard in terms of  people coming here -

EPSTEIN: They might just want to discourage boats and this is another way  of discouraging boats?

MARLES: But that makes no sense in that what you have with offshore processing  is a policy which takes Australia off the table, so this is not about a question of  whether or not you encourage or discourage people from coming here, those  policies are in place. This is, if this is true, simply about trying to avoid anyone  coming to Christmas Island, such that their scoreboard has to reset and if they  throw the humanitarian rulebook out the window in pursuit of that will be a  total disgrace.

EPSTEIN: Quick question Richard Marles, because I need to cross to the bureau  before five o’clock, the Prime Minister Tony Abbott on radio today said that Sri Lanka  is not a perfect country but it is peaceful, the conflict, the formal armed conflict with  the Tamil Tigers is over, is he right?

MARLES: Well the conflict is over, I think whether, it is certainly more peaceful than  what it was five years ago or six years ago when the civil war was still going, but I  think the danger that would persist for any individual obviously depends on their  circumstances and that is why individuals need to be assessed, and that is the  important point to make here, that is the way the refugee convention is framed.

EPSTEIN: Richard Marles thanks for joining us.

MARLES: Thank you.
