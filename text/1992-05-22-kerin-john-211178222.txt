Australian support for the Comprehensive Plan of Action  for Indochinese Asylum Seekers

"The CPA was endorsed by 76 countries in 1989 as a lasting solution to the  Vietnamese and Lao asylum seeker outflow. The outflow was seen to be  increasingly migratory in nature," Mr Kerin said.

"The CPA recognises that fundamental changes in resettlement policy were  necessary to bring the situation under control.

"There has been good progress on many elements of the CPA, including  resettlement of nearly 49,000 Vietnamese and screening for refugee status for  many Vietnamese who have reached first asylum countries.

"Furthermore, Vietnam has taken humane measures to discourage clandestine  departures."

The additional Australian assistance for the implementation of the CPA will be  channelled as follows:   " United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees-$1.36m, for  counselling, care and maintenance of asylum seekers and other services

" Australian Red Cross Society-approximately $91,000, for a training  program in Sungai Besi camp in Malaysia   " Jesuit Refugee Service-$50,000 for a counselling program in Hong Kong.

This contribution will bring total Australian Government support for CPA  implementation to $5.2m. In addition, Australia continues to play a major role  in the CPA by accepting Vietnamese and Laotians who qualify for resettlement.

Australian assistance for Indochinese refugees is administered by Australia's  overseas aid agency, AIDAB.
