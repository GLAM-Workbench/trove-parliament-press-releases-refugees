IMMIGRATION MINISTER ANNOUNCES 
BOOST TO SETTLEMENT SERVICES

Â

Â

The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock, 
today launch ed a new website providing valuable assistance to 
migrants and refugees settling in Australia.

Â

“This website, Settling in Australia, provides clear 
information that will assist migrants and refugees to become part of 
the community,” the Minister said.

Â

“The site contains over 200 pages of text, and hundreds 
of electronic links to other sites providing information on a range 
of issues from quarantine, taxation and health insurance through to 
information on Australia’s climate and its indigenous people.

Â

“Around 42 per cent of the current population was 
born overseas or has a parent born overseas. As a consequence, many 
of us have first-hand experience or are familiar with what is involved 
in settling in a new country.

Â

“Many tasks, such as finding a job, enrolling children 
at school, talking to a doctor, or opening a bank account, can be daunting 
for someone new to Australia.

Â

“Accessing this information through the website 
will help ease the transition to a new life and establish links to mainstream 
services. This will ultimately help people make their way as independent 
members of Australian society,” Mr Ruddock said.

Â

“The site can also be accessed by potential migrants 
offshore, which may assist in making decisions about migrating to Australia.”

Â

“The links to Government departments, Migrant Resource 
Centres, Migrant Service Agencies and other settlement-related sites 
means there is a much greater capacity to meet the information needs 
of our new settlers.

Â

“Settlement in Australia is an example of information 
technology at its best, as it provides a coordinated, comprehensive 
and consistent approach to the delivery of settlement information,” 
the Minister concluded.
