TALKS ON STUDENTS - KUALA LUMPUR

The Australian Federal Minister for Immigration and Ethnic  Affairs,  Mr Stewart West, today had discussions with the  Malaysian Minister for Education regarding Australia's intake  of students from that country. The Minister asked Mr West

to re-examine the number of places available to Malaysian  students in 1984. .

"There will be an increase in Malaysian students accepted  for university and tertiary colleges in Australia in 1984," Mr West said.

A total of 3 600 overseas students entered Australian higher  education institutions in 1983 and this will rise by 10 per cent  in 1984. 1 600 of these students will be from Malaysia.

The total of 4 000 new tertiary students from overseas in  1984 is regarded as the,limit which could be accepted into  Australian higher education, having regard to the demand  within Australia.

Mr West said that of this number, some 2 500 places have been  reserved for overseas students who will complete their  secondary studies in Australia in 1983. The Australian  Government felt that it would be unfair to deny these

students the opportunity for which they had been working. On this basis, 1 500 tertiary places remain available for  students entering directly into tertiary studies from  overseas.

This restriction in new entrants reflects the very high  entry into Australia of overseas students into secondary  studies in 1982 and 1983. .

The Australian Government believes that the overseas students  programme is important from a cultural, humanitarian and  political point of view. It is committed to continue to  provide an opportunity for overseas students.

The Government has decided that there should be a wide-  ranging ‘ review of overseas students policy. The Australian  Government expects this review to determine policy for 1985  and beyond.

Mr West said that he had invited the Malaysian Government to  make submissions to the review.
