WOOMERA TO ACCOMMODATE ILLEGAL ARRIVALS

Â

Acting Minister for immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Senator 
Aman da Vanstone, announced today that an immigration reception 
and processing centre would be set up at Woomera in South Australia 
as a result of the recent influx of illegal immigrants arriving in Australia 
in recent days.

Â

Senator Vanstone said the arrival of 693 illegal entrants 
since November 1 had put significant pressure on Australia’s detention 
facilities.

Â

“There are currently 768 illegal entrants at the 
Port Hedland Centre and 654 at Curtin which, with the arrival of these 
latest boats, will increase to more than 980,” Senator Vanstone said.

Â

“While the latest arrivals will all go to Curtin 
we must ensure accommodation is available for any future arrivals so 
we have decided to utilise some spare space at West Woomera to help 
us manage this situation.

Â

Senator Vanstone said the West Woomera site, which 
is about five kilometres from the town of Woomera, comprises 21 brick 
accommodation blocks which could initially accommodate more than 400 
people.

Â

The Minister said she expected it would cost more 
than $1 million dollars to make the Woomera site operational.
