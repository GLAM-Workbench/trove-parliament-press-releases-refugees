Federal Member for Higgins



Media Release





Open revolt in Labor’s ranks

14 June 2011



Almost 12 months ago, when Julia Gillard took the job of Prime Minister from  Kevin Rudd she said “I accept that the Government has lost track.  We will get  back on track.  I have taken control precisely for that purpose” (PM Julia Gillard on  24 June 2011)

Today on ABC 24Ã¢ÂÂs Ã¢ÂÂCapital HillÃ¢ÂÂ program, the Federal Member for Melbourne  Ports, Michael Danby MP, acknowledged that the caucus was not always happy  with the leadership provided by the Labor ministerial team.

MICHAEL DANBY

I think the caucus is loosening up and providing a bit of leadership. And, you know,  Ministers aren’t always right. They donÃ¢ÂÂt get the perfect public feeling for this. And  this is why weÃ¢ÂÂre elected representatives. If weÃ¢ÂÂre not going to speak up in our own  party rooms, then whatÃ¢ÂÂs the point of being an MP?



Later in the interview the Federal Member for Melbourne Ports refused to back the  Prime MinisterÃ¢ÂÂs Malaysian people swap deal.

Mr Danby MP was asked repeatedly by the Federal Member for Higgins, Kelly  OÃ¢ÂÂDwyer MP, and interviewer Lyndal Curtis, as to whether he supported the  governmentÃ¢ÂÂs policy, saying only that he thought the Labor caucus should review  the idea.

Below is an excerpt from the interview with ABC News 24Ã¢ÂÂs Lyndal Curtis:

KELLY O’DWYER

Do you support the Malaysian deal? Do you support that, Michael?

MICHAEL DANBY

Australia during the Fraser government had regional refugees and centres for the  Vietnamese refugees. (Inaudible) worked together with the international community  and got people back to their (inaudible).

KELLY O’DWYER

I donÃ¢ÂÂt think you support it, Michael.

LYNDAL CURTIS

Would caucus like to scrutinise that Malaysian deal before it proceeds?

MICHAEL DANBY

I think that the caucus will keep a very strong eye on the Malaysian arrangement. I  think the minister is working very hard to see that all of the arrangements are fixed  and in place. IÃ¢ÂÂm sure he is borne in mind very strongly the doubts that a lot of  Australians, including members of parliament, have…

KELLY O’DWYER

Including you.

MICHAEL DANBY

…regarding some of the Malaysian governmentÃ¢ÂÂs practices. I mean after all, there  was 62 members and senators who objected to the way the Malaysian government  is retrying the leader of the opposition there after having the Malaysian head of  police admit that he beat and tortured the Malaysian leader of the opposition. So  weÃ¢ÂÂll be keeping a very close eye on it. But I think the idea of having a regional  refugee solution, bringing 4,000 refugees here and trying to stop people smuggling is  a good idea.



Given that Julia Gillard is yet to celebrate 12 months in the job, she has every  reason to be nervous that her colleagues think that like Kevin Rudd, she too is Ã¢ÂÂoff  trackÃ¢ÂÂ.
