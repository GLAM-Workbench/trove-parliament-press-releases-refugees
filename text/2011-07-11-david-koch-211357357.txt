E&OE……………………….…………………………………………………………………

DAVID KOCH:

Opposition Leader Tony Abbott joins us now. Tony Abbott, good morning to you. Do you believe her?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, Kochie, I think that the Australian public have got very sceptical of this Prime Minister. Let's face it,  this was the Prime Minister who said six days before the last election “there will be no carbon tax under the  government I lead”. If this is such a good deal, why wasn't she prepared to talk about it before the election?  If it was such a good deal, why won't she take it to the next election? Instead, she is trying to sneak it  through a parliament that has no mandate. So, I think there is the fundamental scepticism about this Prime  Minister's word and a fundamental doubt about whether this Government which has been so bad at so much,  whether it be boat people, pink batts, school halls, live cattle, can actually get this very complex change  right.

DAVID KOCH:

Alright. Now, we know it is your job in Opposition to oppose everything the Government does but are there  any positives out of the scheme? Because, you know, back in history you actually supported a carbon tax.  You said an ETS wasn’t the way to go, a carbon tax would have been simpler. You liked that.

TONY ABBOTT:

Kochie, everything changed after Copenhagen. What became obvious at Copenhagen was that the rest of the  world is not going down this path. As the Productivity Commission said just a couple of weeks ago, no  country on earth, not one, has an economy-wide carbon tax or emissions trading scheme. So that is the big  problem.

DAVID KOCH:

Julia Gillard earlier, because I put that question to her, said well Europe has got it, New Zealand, even New  Zealand. So other countries do have it, according to her.

TONY ABBOTT:

But as the Productivity Commission pointed out, none have an economy-wide scheme. There are many  exemptions to New Zealand's scheme, there are many exemptions to Europe's scheme…

DAVID KOCH:

And there are exemptions to ours.

TONY ABBOTT:

Not nearly as many. Ours is an economy-wide scheme but, as I said, don't believe me, believe the  Productivity Commission, which I am quoting. The other point to make, Kochie, is at the same time we are  going to reduce our emissions by five per cent, China is increasing its by 500 per cent and one of the weird  things about the scheme announced yesterday is that it isn't actually going to reduce our emissions. We are  only going to achieve the abatement targets by buying 100 million tonnes worth of permits overseas at the  cost of $3 billion plus.

DAVID KOCH:

Ok. Alright. There is a bit of argument on that from both sides as we can understand. But you said if you get  elected at the next election you will overturn the carbon tax but keep the compensation. Now, after seeing  what surprised everyone as a very generous compensation package, are you able to still promise that now?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, the details of what we will do will be announced in good time before the next election…

DAVID KOCH:

No, no, you said before, if I get elected I will overturn the carbon tax but keep the compensation package.  So, very simple, can you afford to still do that?

TONY ABBOTT:

The short answer is the only tax cuts that are real are tax cuts that are paid for by productivity growth or  reductions in government spending. A tax cut that’s paid for by a tax increase, as this is, is not a real tax cut,  it is just a money-go-round.

DAVID KOCH:

So are you saying, yes you can still maintain that promise?

TONY ABBOTT:

There will be tax cuts without a carbon tax under the Coalition.

DAVID KOCH:

Okay.  You have been very vocal about the scheme costing jobs. Now, in the coal industry and a number of  the big polluting industries, what about the argument that any job losses there will be off set by an increase  in employment in developing these new clean energy industries?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, that's not an argument which is backed up by overseas experience. The overseas experience is that far  more jobs are lost in traditional industries than are created in these so-called green industries and the jobs  that are lost in traditional industries are real jobs. The ones that are created in so-called green industries tend  to be highly subsidised jobs. It is almost impossible to create jobs by increasing the burdens on the economy.  That's why this isn't real reform.

DAVID KOCH:

Okay. Tony Abbott, thanks very much for joining us, appreciate it.

TONY ABBOTT:

Thanks Kochie.
