TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW - ABC 612 BREAKFAST WITH TERRI BEGLEY AND  GEORGE BRANDIS

SUBJECT: IMMIGRATION; NEWSPOLL; CLIMATE CHANGE.

E  & O E - PROOF ONLY



BEGLEY: This morning Finance Minister Penny Wong is squaring off against shadow  attorney-general George Brandis. Good morning to you both, good to have your company  again.

WONG: Good morning Terri.

BRANDIS: Morning Terri.

BEGLEY: ItÃ¢ÂÂs been a while since weÃ¢ÂÂve heard from you, Minister Wong.

WONG: Yes, I havenÃ¢ÂÂt been on for a little while, I think. You had Craig, and others.

BEGLEY: Although the look of the expression on Senator BrandisÃ¢ÂÂ face; I think heÃ¢ÂÂs missed  you.

WONG: (laughs) I donÃ¢ÂÂt know about that. I canÃ¢ÂÂt see him so I couldnÃ¢ÂÂt possibly comment.

BEGLEY: Yes of course, Minister Wong is in Canberra, live, and Senator Brandis is in the  studio.

Now Penny Wong, your boss has been in contact with Tony Abbott, to see what they can  work on as far as asylum seekers, whether they are processed offshore, or onshore. Does  this mean sheÃ¢ÂÂs prepared to ignore the Left in your party, and the Greens, and still pursue  the policy of Labor to go offshore with processing?

WONG: We had a very significant decision from the High Court handed down last week, a  decision that did change the way in which we understood the law. A decision which, frankly,  would have meant that most of the Howard Government policies would not have been  permitted. So itÃ¢ÂÂs obviously a very significant decision - the Prime Minister has offered Mr

2



Abbott a briefing, and I hope he does meet up to his promise to work with the Government  to resolve these issues.

TheyÃ¢ÂÂre not easy issues, and I think Australians understand that these arenÃ¢ÂÂt easy issues.  They havenÃ¢ÂÂt been for 30 years, and they obviously depend on whatÃ¢ÂÂs happening. The  number of people coming depends on a range of factors in the rest of the world, and the  Government has to work through some of these difficult issues after the High Court  decision.

BEGLEY: Can you rule out the Government trying to pursue again the Malaysia swap deal,  or is that dead in the water now?

WONG: WeÃ¢ÂÂve said weÃ¢ÂÂre going to take our time to work our way through the decision. As I  said, it is a different understanding of the law to which had been understood previously, an  understanding of the law which would have ruled out the Howard Government policies as  well. So, we obviously will work our way through them, and I hope Mr Abbott will do what he  says heÃ¢ÂÂll do, which is to work with the Government.

BEGLEY: Senator Brandis, if the Coalition was in power, do you agree with that summary,  that your policies on offshore asylum seeker processing wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt have gotten past the High  Court?

BRANDIS: No thatÃ¢ÂÂs quite wrong, and you only have to read both the High Court decision,  and the Solicitor-GeneralÃ¢ÂÂs advice to know that itÃ¢ÂÂs wrong. You see, the difference that, the  big difference between Malaysia and Nauru - which is our preferred option - is that  Malaysia isnÃ¢ÂÂt a party to the UN Refugee Convention, and has no intention of becoming  one. Nauru is in the process of becoming a party to the UN Refugee Convention, and that  process will come to fulfilment on the 26th of September, in less than 20 daysÃ¢ÂÂ time, at which  point it will become a fully-fledged party to the UN Refugee Convention.

I actually had a conversation on Saturday afternoon with Mr Matthew Batsiua, who is the  Justice Minister of Nauru, and he assured me that upon Nauru becoming a party to the UN  Refugee Convention, Nauru would enact in its domestic law whatever domestic laws were  necessary to ensure that it was compliant with the Convention, which would in turn satisfy  what the High Court found to be missing from the Malaysia Solution. Now, if I can just read  you one critical sentence, one critical sentence from the Solicitor-GeneralÃ¢ÂÂs opinion. This is  what he says, “The coming into force of the Refugee Convention in Nauru has subjected it  to obligations under international law which provide at least the elements found to be  missing by the majority in last weekÃ¢ÂÂs decision in relation to Malaysia.” So it makes all the  difference.

BEGLEY: So, Senator Brandis, as far as youÃ¢ÂÂre concerned, legally, the Government has  good grounds to restart Nauru, and worry about it being challenged back in the High Court.  Penny Wong, why is your top legal adviser to the Government still hesitant on this?

WONG: IÃ¢ÂÂm sure your listeners would be fascinated in George and I arguing the niceties of  a High Court case, and the Solicitor-GeneralÃ¢ÂÂs advice. He selectively quoted from that  advice, and if people want to go to the advice, theyÃ¢ÂÂll see that a lot of issues are raised. The  High Court speaks not only of the Refugee Convention, but also what has to be contained

3



in domestic law. And in particular, what rights and entitlements asylum seekers would need  to be provided -

BRANDIS: It has to be contained within the domestic law or laws giving effect to the  Refugee Convention.

WONG: Which at this stage is not what occurs in Nauru. But we can have an argument  about what the High Court said. I donÃ¢ÂÂt agree, nor does the Solicitor-General, with George  BrandisÃ¢ÂÂ view. HeÃ¢ÂÂs entitled to that view, but I think heÃ¢ÂÂs wrong. But weÃ¢ÂÂre the Government,  and we need to -

BRANDIS: Unfortunately, it was the Solicitor-General who was wrong in giving your  Government the advice that he gave it, which your Minister described as very strong  advice.

WONG: And he is the most senior legal counsel to the Government, and he would have  been were you in government, so letÃ¢ÂÂs not play point-scoring on that. The point is here,  weÃ¢ÂÂve got to move forward, to try to work our way through it, and I hope we can.

BEGLEY: Well this is where we are right now, with Tony Abbott and Julia Gillard  exchanging letters, and saying that they are prepared to work with each other. Where will  the starting point be on negotiations on refugee policy, Penny Wong?

WONG: Terri, I think IÃ¢ÂÂd be announcing the GovernmentÃ¢ÂÂs position on your program, which  IÃ¢ÂÂm sure would be interesting for -

BEGLEY: I wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt mind if you do.

WONG: (laughs) IÃ¢ÂÂm sure you wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt mind that, but I donÃ¢ÂÂt intend to do that, and I think  that there are many things we need to work through as a result of this decision -

BEGLEY: Senator Brandis, can I, sorry, Penny Wong.

WONG: Sure.

BEGLEY: Will there be any strings attached to Tony Abbott talking turkey with Julia Gillard?

BRANDIS: Well, the meeting isnÃ¢ÂÂt with Julia Gillard, the meeting is with officials, and Mr  Abbott and I will be going to that meeting in Brisbane this afternoon. Now, Mr Abbott has  set out what the OppositionÃ¢ÂÂs position is. I feel a bit sorry for Penny, because, you know, the  problem is that the Government doesnÃ¢ÂÂt have a position, so, you know, it must be very  tantalising for her to ask what the position is.

WONG: George, before you attack, perhaps you could answer the question, which is, what  strings are you going to attach to the proposition?

BEGLEY: What are you going to put on the table?

BRANDIS: Mr Abbott has indicated that we favour the Nauru solution. We donÃ¢ÂÂt see  Malaysia as a solution. Malaysia, by the way Terri, let me remind your listeners, was not

4



about offshore processing. There was no processing of these people who were going to be  sent to Malaysia, they were just going to be dumped there.

WONG: Well thatÃ¢ÂÂs just not true George. I mean, seriously -

BRANDIS: There was not going to be processing of those people in Malaysia. A point that  -



WONG: Dumping is really quite inflammatory.

BRANDIS: Well unfortunately, thatÃ¢ÂÂs what the policy meant.

WONG: Oversight, engagement with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.

BRANDIS: Well what does the word Ã¢ÂÂengagementÃ¢ÂÂ mean?

WONG: Really, to use words like dumping in this debate. I just think we have to be careful  as politicians about how we speak in this debate -

BRANDIS: ThatÃ¢ÂÂs right.

WONG: Because it is an easy debate to inflame. And regrettably, your side of politics,  George, always takes the option of inflaming it.

BEGLEY: Can we go back to this afternoonÃ¢ÂÂs meeting though. Senator Brandis, what is it  that Tony Abbott and yourself are going to put on the table to the Government?

BRANDIS: Well Mr Abbott is the principal, of course. Now, our position has been set out,  weÃ¢ÂÂre there to listen -

WONG: George does that mean you donÃ¢ÂÂt know, mate? Does that mean you donÃ¢ÂÂt know?

BRANDIS: This is a briefing, OK. This is briefing, itÃ¢ÂÂs not a negotiation. And Mr AbbottÃ¢ÂÂs  position has been put by him on the public record, most recently in the letter which has  been publicly released that he wrote to the Prime Minister yesterday afternoon.

BEGLEY: Yes. And youÃ¢ÂÂre not going to tell us any more?

BRANDIS: Well itÃ¢ÂÂs a briefing. This rather, kind of, tendentious expression - what strings  are attached - we have a policy. We think the Nauru solution was a good solution. The  reason weÃ¢ÂÂre confident in saying it was a good solution is that it actually worked. There  were 18 refugee boats in six years before the Labor Party weakened the policy in 2008.

WONG: And everyone who was processed in Nauru - almost everybody - came to  Australia.

BRANDIS: 43 per cent of them, according to the figures IÃ¢ÂÂve seen. But, anyway, just to  complete this issue, let me just say this: we do accept that it is desirable if the Nauru  solution were to be revived. But it is desirable that there should be legislation to put the  matter beyond doubt. Now, I donÃ¢ÂÂt think there is a great deal of doubt, if Nauru makes itself

5



compliant with the Refugee Convention, that it would fall under the requirements of the High  Courts decision last week. But nevertheless, we can see that for reasons of prudence why  the Government would wish to remove any possible doubt, and we would - as Mr Abbott  has said - support them in doing that.

BEGLEY: OK, well I think we probably have talked that one out so far.

WONG: Are we going to talk about magpies now, Terri?

BEGLEY: (laughs) Penny, look, IÃ¢ÂÂm getting there. I know youÃ¢ÂÂre keen.

WONG: (laughs) I enjoyed listening to that discussion before we came on air.

BEGLEY: And I have a feeling that weÃ¢ÂÂre going to talk about it again shortly. YouÃ¢ÂÂre  listening to 612 ABC Brisbane, Inside Canberra, and its 14 minutes to 10. This morning,  you are listening to Senator George Brandis, the shadow attorney-general, and Finance  Minister, Penny Wong.

Now, the Newspoll yesterday, itÃ¢ÂÂs inevitable that I was going to bring this up. Your boss,  Penny Wong, once again falling to her lowest ever rating as preferred Prime Minister. 34  per cent, thatÃ¢ÂÂs down 4 points. And if an election were held this week, Labor standing to  lose 40 seats, 9 MPs. Can you really turn this around without a change of leader?

WONG: I think the way that weÃ¢ÂÂre approaching this is to try and ensure we keep focused on  doing whatÃ¢ÂÂs right for the nation. And some of the reforms weÃ¢ÂÂre putting in place, Terri, are  long term reforms.

BEGLEY: But why is the message getting lost on people right now?

WONG: And thatÃ¢ÂÂs fair enough, and weÃ¢ÂÂve got to keep getting out there and arguing it. But  can I just put this point: people often say to me they want politicians to think beyond the  next election and look at whatÃ¢ÂÂs right for the country, long term.

Now you may disagree with what weÃ¢ÂÂre putting forward, but thereÃ¢ÂÂs no doubt the minerals  tax, which is about spreading the benefits of the boom, giving a tax cut to all other  companies, plus a head start to small business, is good for the patchwork economy.

ThereÃ¢ÂÂs no doubt that the carbon tax is about making sure we move to a clean energy  future. ThereÃ¢ÂÂs no doubt that these are issues that are looking to the long term. You may  disagree with them, but at least weÃ¢ÂÂre asking the right question, which is where do we want  Australia to be in five or ten years. And we want to have a cleaner energy economy, and an  economy thatÃ¢ÂÂs spread the benefits of the mining boom and is able to compete in the world.

BEGLEY: But you also need faith in the leader of your party by the voters to ensure that  this can be done.

WONG: And what IÃ¢ÂÂd say to people is Julia is decent, she is tough and sheÃ¢ÂÂs absolutely  focussed on what is in the national interest. And thatÃ¢ÂÂs how weÃ¢ÂÂre going to keep  approaching government.

BEGLEY: Reports in the last 24 hours quoting senior Labor figures, saying that they are  prepared to give her until Christmas for things to turn around.

WONG: I never comment on things that are alleged to have been said by some people  somewhere in the paper. My view is this - we have a leader, sheÃ¢ÂÂs prepared to tackle many  of the issues that people havenÃ¢ÂÂt been able to tackle. Climate change, thatÃ¢ÂÂs been around  since John Howard was Prime Minister; a promise to price carbon. She has the votes to  carry that through the Parliament. We didnÃ¢ÂÂt have that in a majority government last term  and I absolutely support what sheÃ¢ÂÂs doing.

BEGLEY: Senator Brandis would you describe the mood of your side of politics as buoyant  in the wake of these figures? This continual poll results, seeing your leader improve each  time?

BRANDIS: Look, we read the same figures and we draw our own conclusions. But can I  just comment on what Penny said. It sounds fine, but for one very big hole in the middle of  the argument. If the Prime Minister, Ms Gillard, had gone to the last election and said I  know it might be controversial but I really think itÃ¢ÂÂs in the national interest to have a carbon  tax and had just fallen over the line or gotten the numbers that sheÃ¢ÂÂs got in the House of  Representatives today - what Penny says might be fair enough and we could have an  argument on the policy merits but not about the legitimacy.

The problem for the advocates of the carbon tax is that everybody in Australia knows Julia  Gillard was elected because she promised not to have a carbon tax. And forcing this  through the Parliament means that the people will never get to have a say. And I donÃ¢ÂÂt know  what bizarre view of democracy allows that to happen but people are rightly outraged that  first of all, they were lied to and secondly theyÃ¢ÂÂre now having this forced down their throats  without having been given the opportunity to have a say.

BEGLEY: A quick response Penny Wong?

WONG: Thank you. First, GeorgeÃ¢ÂÂs view of democracy was not the one he had when he  voted against pricing carbon after going to the 2007 election with a promise to price carbon.  The second thing is, I donÃ¢ÂÂt think anybody who saw the Labor Party during the last election  or previously ever thought we said we would never act on climate change. Our policy was  for an emissions trading scheme. Because of the Parliament we have, we have a period of  a fixed price which operates like a tax. But the fundamental premise that we didnÃ¢ÂÂt say -  that we said we would not price carbon, we would not take action on climate change, is  incorrect.

But I think the point is this, someone at some point has to have the courage to act on  climate change. It is true we are asking this generation of Australians to do something. It is  not as disastrous as Tony Abbott would have us believe when he says industries are going  to end and the sky is going to fall in. But we are saying to this generation of Australians -  we want you to do something now to make our economy cleaner, to improve our  environment so we can ensure we reduce the risk for our children and our grandchildren.  And I think that is a good thing.

BEGLEY: I think youÃ¢ÂÂve both been given a fair hearing on this. As with most weeks on  Inside Canberra, this does tend to come up and we go back over a bit of the ground again.

Moving onto another issue - of course it is ten years since the September 11 attacks and  people here in Australia are also thinking about what that has meant for our national  security - what has our Government done in the meantime to ensure we can fight terrorism  attacks as best we can. Reports this week of the publishing of the new Indonesian  Embassy plans on a government website has created some concerns that it was a major  security risk to this nation, having those plans available on the internet. Penny Wong, what  do you know of this?

WONG: I donÃ¢ÂÂt have any additional information, other than whatÃ¢ÂÂs in the public arena.  Obviously, it is extremely regrettable that this has occurred but I donÃ¢ÂÂt have any further  information on that. I would say I think governments of both political persuasions have  sought to improve our counter terrorism operations, our resourcing of national security  issues. And thatÃ¢ÂÂs a constant task and I think governments of both persuasions - we may  not have agreed with what we did - but that has been something over the last decade since  9/11 - weÃ¢ÂÂve done.

BRANDIS: A rare moment, or a splendid moment of bipartisanship. The Opposition has  supported the GovernmentÃ¢ÂÂs counter terrorism measures. WeÃ¢ÂÂve had some criticism on  particular matters but by and large this is an issue that has been prosecuted in a bipartisan  spirit by both sides. I donÃ¢ÂÂt know anything - have any special knowledge of the Indonesian  website - but can I just make this point to you. As the shadow attorney-general, I receive  regular briefings from ASIO. Can I just say that anyone who thinks that because ten years  have gone by since 9/11 that the terrorist threat has abated, is a fool. It is a tribute to our  national security agencies that there hasnÃ¢ÂÂt been an incident and we should remain vigilant.

BEGLEY: Moving onto another quick issue before we let you both go. This morning Penny  Wong, the opposition climate spokesperson Greg Hunt has announced that the Opposition  is making a call to the Auditor-General now to take a close look at the management of the  Federal GovernmentÃ¢ÂÂs solar rebate scheme.

He says there is evidence pointing to millions of dollars being owed to installers by  unscrupulous solar traders and he says this happened on the Federal GovernmentÃ¢ÂÂs watch,  under this program. Will you look at these concerns - he says there are Queensland  businesses here, small businesses that are going to go to the wall because of the  mismanagement of this scheme.

WONG: Well IÃ¢ÂÂve got to say Greg Hunt calls for an Auditor General inquiry almost as often  as he asks for a cup of coffee I suspect; itÃ¢ÂÂs a pretty regular occurrence. But can I say on  this issue, I understand there has been some problems with Well Being Green, I think is the  company -

BEGLEY: In fact no I think thatÃ¢ÂÂs the one in Victoria. This is a separate incident he brought  up this morning. I guess the fact remains youÃ¢ÂÂve got people in small business who are  heavily exposed to this. TheyÃ¢ÂÂre not getting paid by the solar traders.

WONG: Sure. Well letÃ¢ÂÂs be clear what our job is. First in relation to the regulatory agencies  there is obviously the Australian Securities [and Investments] Commission, the Australian  Competition and Consumer Commission and also offices of fair trading in each of the  states. And people should refer relevant complaints to those authorities.

In terms of what we have done, our job is to regulate the issue of the solar certificates, the  renewable energy certificates and since in the last couple of years weÃ¢ÂÂve significantly  increased the compliance structure around those certificates. This is legislation that was  first introduced by the Howard Government. We have significantly strengthened the  regulatory framework.

BEGLEY: So -

WONG: Sorry, no, you go ahead Terry. IÃ¢ÂÂm not familiar with the precise arrangements  which have occurred in relation to the Queensland company. Obviously if this is about  contracts between the company and other parties, thatÃ¢ÂÂs not necessarily regulated by the  Federal Government.

BEGLEY: ItÃ¢ÂÂs not regulated but it is a Federal Government solar rebate scheme. George  Brandis?

BRANDIS: Well I think most people who have followed this have realised the solar rebate  scheme was another fiasco. I mean itÃ¢ÂÂs like pink batts -

WONG: Hang on George, you supported it.

BRANDIS: Your administration -

WONG: You supported it, come on, give us a break.

BRANDIS: Your administration of solar rebates -

WONG: Has improved since weÃ¢ÂÂve been in Government -

BRANDIS: Has been a fiasco. And itÃ¢ÂÂs all very well to laugh at Greg Hunt for saying, for  calling so often for Auditor-GeneralÃ¢ÂÂs inquiries. The reason the Auditor-General exists is to  stop public money being wasted. And there seems to have been more occasions to call in  the Auditor General, whether it be pink batts or school halls or solar rebate schemes or  whatever under this Government -

WONG: This is just the usual diatribe from George Brandis on this, why donÃ¢ÂÂt you deal with  the issue.

BRANDIS: Penny face up to it. Take responsibility.

WONG: I do take responsibility and perhaps you should take responsibility for some of the  financing on your side where we know there is a $70 billion black hole.

BRANDIS: There are credible -

WONG: A $70 billion black hole in your costings.

BRANDIS: There are credible reports in this morningÃ¢ÂÂs newspapers that there has been  fraud and massive waste in the solar rebate scheme. ItÃ¢ÂÂs entirely appropriate for the

9



shadow minister to say the Auditor-General should look at it. And whatÃ¢ÂÂs curious and begs  explanation is why the Government is trying to avoid the Auditor-General shining light on  this.

WONG: Hang on - who said that? You just made an accusation, as is your wont, which is  not founded. I simply made the comment -

BRANDIS: Penny, you were asked -

WONG: I simply made the comment that Greg Hunt regularly calls for Auditor-General  enquiries. If you look at some of the schemes, there is no one in Government who will  defend what has occurred in relation to the Home Insulation scheme but if you look at how  Greg Combet handled that - that was absolutely transparent. We were absolutely clear  about the need for transparency in making sure, we found what had occurred and remedied  it.



BRANDIS: Well Penny your minister -

WONG: And I am saying to you -

BRANDIS: Will there be an Auditor-General inquiry?

WONG: If there is credible evidence that would warrant an inquiry then absolutely we would  be prepared to look at it.  But what IÃ¢ÂÂm saying also is that our job is to regulate the issue of  certificates something which we are doing in a far more stringent way than ever occurred  under your Government.

BEGLEY: Up against the news, one quick question. I promised you IÃ¢ÂÂd bring it up and IÃ¢ÂÂm  going to again - the magpie issue. It seems the only thing people do want to talk about this  morning. I guess, which side on the fence are you on - shooting a rogue magpie by police  or picking it up and relocating it. Ever been on the other end of a sharp beak yourself?

WONG: I remember when I first arrived in Australia from Malaysia and we lived in the hills.  And walking to primary school was a pretty hazardous journey because we used to get  swooped a fair bit at certain times of the year. Personally, maybe IÃ¢ÂÂm a softie, I just donÃ¢ÂÂt  want to think about killing creatures.

BEGLEY: Thank you for your time Minister Wong this morning.

WONG: Good to speak with you Terri.

BEGLEY: Penny Wong and her last word on the magpies. A very quick last word from you  Senator Brandis.

BRANDIS: I have the opposite view. Given a choice between looking after wildlife and  keeping kids safe, IÃ¢ÂÂll go for keeping kids safe every time.

BEGLEY: And there you go, holding an opposite view and being in opposition. Thank you  very much for your time again George Brandis.

10



BRANDIS: Thank you Terri.

BEGLEY: Senator George Brandis and Penny Wong playing Inside Canberra this morning.
