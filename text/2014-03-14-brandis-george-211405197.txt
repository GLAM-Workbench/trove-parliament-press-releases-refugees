E&OE

ATTORNEY-GENERAL:  Well, good morning, ladies  and gentlemen.  This  morning, the   Government is releasing the letters patent, issued yesterday by Her Excellency the Governor-General, to Mr Dyson Heydon QC to ask him to act as Royal Commissioner and to conduct a  Royal Commission into what might broadly be described as the governance, and in particular  the financial governance, arrangements of trade unions.

This  is  something  that  was  foreshadowed  some  time  ago.  It  is  obviously  a  very  pressing   matter.  There has been, in recent years, evidence not of sporadic, but of systemic misconduct  in the financial  management  of trade unions  of  sufficient  gravity that, in  the Government’s   view, nothing less than a Royal Commission is necessary.

The particular matter that is at the heart of the Royal Commissioner’s task is to examine the  creation  of  funds  established  by  trade  unions  and  other  employee  associations,  purportedly   for the  benefit  of  their members but  which are  used as  a vehicle  for  other activities.  More  generally, the Royal Commissioner has been given terms of reference to enable him to deal

with questions of bribery, corruption and secret commissions by people purporting to act on  behalf of trade unions.

This  is  a  matter  which  the  Government  is  doing  to  protect  the  interests  of  the hundreds  of   thousands of honest, decent trade unionists in Australia.  Trade union members are typically  among the relatively poorer members of the community.  They pay dues to their union.  They  expect  that  those  dues  will  be  spent  to  advance  their  wellbeing  and  their  welfare  but  there   have been too many episodes that we know of only so well in recent years when that hasn’t  been done.

Mr Shorten, who of  course owes  his  position as  the Leader  of  the Labor Party to  the  trade   union  bosses  and  is  himself  a  former  trade  union  boss  presiding  over  a  shadow  cabinet  of   former trade union bosses, has said that if there is evidence of misconduct, it should be dealt  with by the police.  So it should and in certain instances, it has been.  But what Mr Shorten  well knows is that where there is a pattern of conduct, where there is ingrained, widespread  and systemic conduct, then reporting individual cases to the police does not get to the root of  the problem.  When there is systemic abuse, one requires a Royal Commission, with all the  powers  of  a  Royal  Commissioner,  to  deal  with  it,  to  identify  it,  to  identify  its  causes,  to   identify the  gaps  in  the  current  legal  arrangements  which  could  be  tightened  to  ensure  that   this misconduct does not occur again.

Now, the man who the Government has asked to conduct the Royal Commission is Mr Dyson  Heydon QC.  There is no better lawyer in Australia.  There is no more fiercely independent  person in Australia than Dyson Heydon QC.  Dyson Heydon was, at various times, one of the  most  senior  silks  at  the  New  South  Wales  bar,  he  was  a  member  of  the  New  South  Wales   Court  of  Appeal,  he  was  for  many  years  a  very  distinguished  Judge  of  the  High  Court  of   Australia  and  as  a  High  Court  Judge,  he  won  a  reputation  for  being  a  person  of  fiercely   independent mind.  So the Government is confident that Mr Heydon will undertake his Royal  Commission and will get to the bottom of this systemic problem.

The Royal Commission having been established by the issue yesterday of letters patent, it’s  really  not  appropriate  now  for  me  or  any  member  of  the  Government  to  comment  much   further,  other  than  to  identify  the  vice  which  we  have  identified,  which  has  caused  us  to   establish  this  Royal  Commission  and  to  release  to  you,  ladies  and  gentlemen,  and  to  the   public, the terms of reference.

The Royal Commission, I understand, will commence its work with a first directions hearing  on 9 April.  It will have all the powers of a Royal Commission under the Royal Commissions  Act 1902 (Cth) and we have asked Mr Heydon to report to the Government by 31 December.

REPORTER:                        Do  you  think  the  Labor  Party  has  anything  to  fear  from  this   Royal Commission?

ATTORNEY-GENERAL:  Well,  I  hope  the  Labor  Party  doesn’t  have  anything  to  fear   because  if  members  of  the  Labor Party  are  fearful,  that  would  only  be  because  they  have   engaged in, or know about, misconduct.

REPORTER:                        Will this inquiry look at whether businesses are involved in any  kind of collusion to keep the costs  of equipment  and machinery high?  Will  it  look at  non-competitive  practices  by  business?  Why  weren’t  these  things  referred  to  in  the  terms  of   reference?

ATTORNEY-GENERAL:  Well, there are a dozen or so terms of reference.  They are wide  enough to extend to not only those who are the principle actors, or the principle offenders in  unlawful conduct, but those who are parties to that misconduct.  If I can give you the example  of bribery or corruption.  It takes at least two people to be involved in bribery and corruption  - somebody  to take  a  bribe  and  somebody  to  offer  one.  If  there  are  businesses  or   businesspeople  who  have  engaged  in,  or  been  complicit  in,  the  conduct  which  the  Royal   Commission  has  been  established  to  identify,  then  the  Royal  Commission  does  have   sufficient powers to expose and pursue those matters as well.

REPORTER:                        Why not specifically refer to businesses or colluders though in  the terms of reference?  Don’t you risk making it look like a witch hunt against unions and  excusing or turning a blind eye to the role of businesses?

ATTORNEY-GENERAL:  Well,  I’ve  already  answered  that  question.  The  powers  are   broad enough to cover that and I can assure you, and anybody who knows him would equally  assure you, there is no way in the world that a lawyer of the eminence of Mr Heydon would  be involved in a witch hunt.

REPORTER:                        Who will be counsel assisting?

ATTORNEY-GENERAL:  Counsel  assisting  have  been  appointed.  It’s  for  the  Royal   Commission  to  release  the  identities  assisting  and  I  think  that’s  really  more,  purely  out  of   courtesy to the Royal Commissioner, a matter for him rather than me to announce.

REPORTER:                        You say that police investigations are appropriate in individual  cases  but  because  you  think  this  is  a  systemic  problem  - that’s  why we’re  having  a  Royal   Commission.  What  evidence  is  there  that  it’s  systemic  though?  How  many  cases  do  you   think that it takes to make something systemic?

ATTORNEY-GENERAL:  I  think  there  has  been  sufficient  evidence  in recent  years  in   matters concerning the Health Services Unions, for example, the CFMEU, for example, the  AWU,  for  example,  to  show  that  this  problem  is  not  isolated,  it  is  not  sporadic,  it  is  not   specific  to  only  one  or  two  trade  unions  but  that  it  is  endemic.  Now,  how  systemic,  how   endemic, how widespread is something that Royal Commission will no doubt expose.

REPORTER:                        Do you know which unions will be called first?

ATTORNEY-GENERAL:  No,  I  don’t.  I  want  to  stress  something  about  the  nature  of  a   Royal Commission.  A government establishes a Royal Commission by asking the Governor-General  to  issue  letters  patent  setting  out  its  terms  of  reference  and  specifying  a  reporting   date  and  other  administrative  matters.  The Royal  Commissions  Act  1902 (Cth)  clothes  the   Royal  Commission  in  its  powers  but  once  a  Royal  Commission  is  established,  the  Royal   Commissioner is his own master.  He is limited only by the terms of the Royal Commissions  Act - the  powers  under  which  are  very  wide  - and  by  the  terms  of  reference.  It’s  not   appropriate for me to talk about how the Royal Commission will go about its work.  It’s not  appropriate  for  me,  or  any  minister  for  that  matter,  to  be  a  commentator  on  the  Royal   Commission.  The Royal Commission is entirely independent of government.

REPORTER:                        Are you worried about damage to the reputation of the overall  union movement from this?

ATTORNEY-GENERAL:  Well, what I’m worried about is the rights of the overwhelming  majority of trade union members who are the people in this country most upset by revelations  of  recent  years  because,  as  I said  before,  these  people  are  among  the  poorest  people  in  the   country, many of them.  They pay union dues, they’re in most instances forced to pay union  dues.  They  do  so  expecting  that  that  money  will  be  used  to  look  after  their  interests  and   plainly, in a number of cases, that hasn’t been.  So if you ask me what I’m worried about, I’m  worried about them.

REPORTER:                        When  will  you  releasing  the  terms  of  reference  of  the

Productivity  Commission  review  and  have  you  finalised  who  will  you  get  to  cover  that   inquiry?

ATTORNEY-GENERAL:  The  Productivity  Commission  review  is  a  matter  for  another   minister so I’m not in a position to answer your question.

REPORTER:                        Do  you  know  if  the  directions  hearing  is  in  Sydney  or

Melbourne?

ATTORNEY-GENERAL:  I expect it will be.

REPORTER:                        But which one?

ATTORNEY-GENERAL:  I expect  it  will  be  in  Sydney.  Mr  Heydon is  based  in  Sydney  and I know that the Senior Counsel assisting is based in Sydney so although I would expect  that the Royal Commission will take evidence in localities other than Sydney, my expectation  is  that  the  first  directions  hearing  would  be  in  Sydney  but  that’s  only  an  expectation.  It’s  entirely a matter for the Royal Commission to decide these things.  The Royal Commissioner  doesn’t  discuss  these  matters  with  me  and  the  Royal  Commission  now  having  been   established, I will make sure that although I know Mr Heydon slightly - I will make sure that  I have no communication with him because it wouldn’t be appropriate for any minister of the  Government to communicate with Mr Heydon now because it’s entirely a matter for him.

REPORTER:                        On  another  matter,  there’s  reports  today that  the  organisers  of   the biennale have buckled to pressure and it looks like Transfield is still going to be one of  the major sponsors.  What’s your reaction to that?

ATTORNEY-GENERAL:  Well, I understand that the Acting Chair of the Board is having  a press conference about now.  I haven’t heard what you’ve just said to me but if that’s the  case,  I’d  be  delighted.  Transfield  has  been  a  wonderful  corporate  citizen.  It  has  been  the   principle sponsor of what is a very important arts event in this city for many years now and I  think the decision, under pressure from certain individual artists pursuing political agendas, to  terminate  the  Transfield  sponsorship  was  a  terrible  error  of  judgment,  if  not  worse.  If  the  board has come around - I haven’t heard that - but if the board has come around, that would  be a good outcome.

REPORTER:                        What  do  you  make  of  the  report  about  the  problems  at  ASIO   with that Egyptian terrorist asylum seeker who was kept in a low-security facility for some   time?  What  do  you  make  of  that  and  also  what  is  the  Government  doing  to  fix  those   problems?

ATTORNEY-GENERAL:  The  Government  received  the  report  from  the  IGIS  sometime   ago.  I’m told by my colleague, Mr Morrison, who has the responsibility within his portfolio  for  the  detention  network,  that  a  number  of  the  recommendations  of  that  report  are  either   being implemented or had already, in fact, been  anticipated and have been implemented by  the Government but as to the detail, I should direct you to Mr Morrison.

REPORTER:                        Does  it  concern  you  that  there  were  those  lapses  in

communication in ASIO?

ATTORNEY-GENERAL:  Well, when we were in Opposition and I first raised this matter  in Senate Estimates more than a year ago, I said at the time that it was extremely concerning  that a person who was the subject of an INTERPOL red notice, which is the highest level of  alert  that  INTERPOL  issues,  should  be  being  detained  in  community detention,  effectively

behind a pool fence, in low-security detention and that that fact hadn’t been picked up.  The  Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security has looked at the matter, has made a number  of  recommendations  and  those  are  either  being  acted  upon  by the  new  Government  or  had   been anticipated and put into operation by Mr Morrison at his own initiative.

REPORTER:                        Would  arts  organisations  be  making  an  error  of  judgment  if   they rejected sponsorship from tobacco companies?

ATTORNEY-GENERAL:  Well, I’m not going to talk about individual industry sectors but  let me just make this general point.  We want as much corporate philanthropy for the arts in  this country as we can get.  We have a wonderful arts sector in Australia.  Some of our best  arts  companies,  like  Bangarra,  like  the  Australian  Ballet,  like  the  Australian  Chamber   Orchestra - just to name but three - are internationally famous.  People in Australia just don’t  get  it  - that  our  best  arts  companies  are  among  the  best  in  the  world  but  because we  are  a

relatively small nation in terms of population, we need corporate sponsors as well as taxpayer  monies  to  give  those  arts  companies  the  opportunity  to  do  what  they  do  best.  And  it  is  a   terrible  thing  for  the  board  of  the  Sydney  Biennale,  under  pressure  from  some  artists  who   wanted to make a political point, to terminate the sponsorship of their principal partner, who  had been such a generous benefactor for so long.

And if, as your colleague has  just said, that decision has been reversed this morning - I’ve  not heard of it yet but if that were to be the case that would be a very good outcome.

REPORTER:                        Do  you  have  concerns  about  a  justice  system  which  allowed   Daniel  Morcombe’s  killer  to  be  out  in  the  community  even  though  he was  a  repeated   paedophile?

ATTORNEY-GENERAL:  Well,  that’s  a  matter  for  state  law.  People  in  this  country are   entitled to the presumption of innocence.  When they’re put on trial for the most serious of  crimes, they are of course entitled to the presumption of innocence until a jury finds that they

are guilty beyond reasonable doubt.  That has happened with this person who committed this  horrible, horrible crime and he has been dealt with accordingly.  He was apprehended through  the good work, in particular, of the Queensland Police and I think Australians, Queenslanders  in particular, will breathe a sigh of relief that he is behind bars and no doubt he will stay there  for many years to come.

REPORTER:                        Just on the Racial Discrimination Act, does it remain - can you  clarify,  are  you  planning  to  remove  18C  in  its  entirety?  Because  the  Institute  of  Public   Affairs seems to fear that you are diluting your promise on this.

ATTORNEY-GENERAL:  Well, I’ve seen that commentary and it’s inaccurate.  What Mr  Abbott and I have said since the election about section 18C is precisely, word-for-word, what  we said before the election and that is that we would repeal section 18C in its current form,  that  we  would  remove  from  the  Racial  Discrimination  Act the  anti-free  speech  provisions,   which enabled, for example, the journalist Andrew Bolt to be taken to court merely because  he expressed an opinion about a matter of public policy which was offensive to some.  Now,  another  thing  we  promised  before  the  election  was  that  we  would  engage  in  thorough

community consultation as to the shape of reforms to the Racial Discrimination Act.  I have  done that.  I have met with many stakeholders, community groups and interested individuals.

We  wouldn’t  have  promised  a  process  of  community  consultation  if  our  promise  was  as   simple as that.  What we promised to do was to rewrite the law by repealing section 18C in its  current  form  so  that  it  is  no  longer  an  impediment  to,  or  a  chill  factor,  upon  freedom  of   speech and that’s what we’re going to do.

REPORTER:                        Your  frontbench  colleague,  Scott  Morrison,  was  asked  by  his   local paper if he thought of himself as becoming Prime Minister one day.  He says that he’s  up for any challenge.  Do you think he’s got what it takes?

ATTORNEY-GENERAL:  Well,  I  haven’t  seen  that  but  you  know,  Scott  Morrison  is  a   tremendously successful  minister.  He  is  one  of  the  absolute  stars  of  this  Government.  For  six  years,  the  Labor  Party  said  the  boats  couldn’t  be  stopped.  Mr Morrison  assumed  the   portfolio; he introduced a new set of measures that the Labor Party hadn’t had the wit to think  of.  He implemented those policies with purpose and firmness and is it 84 days now since the  last boat arrival?  So it just goes to show that if you’ve got a good man or woman in the job,  it can be done.  But it took Scott Morrison and Coalition Government to do it.
