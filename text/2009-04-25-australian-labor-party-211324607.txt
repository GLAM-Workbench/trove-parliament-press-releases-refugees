BORDER PROTECTION COMMAND INTERCEPTS VESSEL

A suspected illegal entry vessel was intercepted today by the Royal Australian Navy patrol  boat HMAS Albany, operating under the control of Border Protection Command, 90 nautical  miles south-west of Ashmore Island, approximately 900 kilometres from Darwin.

The vessel sighting was confirmed by a Customs and Border Protection Command Dash 8  aircraft following an alert by an oil rig tender vessel to the Customs and Border Protection  hotline.

Within an hour of receiving the alert, the Royal Australian Navy patrol boat HMAS Albany  had intercepted the boat.

The boat was intercepted in international waters and the group have voluntarily transferred  from their boat to the HMAS Albany.

Initial indications are that there are approximately 2 crew and 54 passengers on board.

The Minister for Home Affairs, Bob Debus, said the successful interception demonstrated the  effectiveness of Border Protection Command’s surveillance.

“Our surveillance is strong and targeted and officers from Customs and Border Protection  and the Royal Australian Navy are working together to protect Australia from unauthorised  arrivals.

“The Australian Government is committed to strong border security arrangements and will  continue to deal effectively and appropriately with people smugglers.”

The group will be transferred to HMAS Albany and taken to Christmas Island where they will  undergo health, security and other checks to establish their identity and reasons
