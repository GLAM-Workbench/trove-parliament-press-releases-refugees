Topic/s: Labor’s border protection failures / national security breach

Michael Keenan

I want to raise two very serious matters that we have been raising with the Government for the past two months that were referred  to in Senate Estimates last night. That is the matter of the suspected Egyptian terrorist and the accused Sri Lankan murderer who  have both come to Australia courtesy of people smugglers. In the case of the Egyptian terrorist this represents a very significant  breach of national security. This person arrived in Australia on a people smuggling boat and is the subject of an Interpol red  notice, which is effectively an international arrest warrant that is reserved for the most serious of criminals, as is the case with this  man. When he arrived in Australia he was detained in Inverbrackie, which is a low security detention facility in the Adelaide Hills. It  is surrounded by what is essentially a pool fence and it was revealed last night that he was there for almost a year before it was  exposed in the media and the Government subsequently put him into Villawood, a centre that has had up to 40 escapes.  Secondly in the case of the accused Sri Lankan murderer, he was released astonishingly into the community on a bridging visa.  We have been calling on the Government to provide details to the Australian people about both of these cases and none of those  details have been forthcoming and I call on them again to come clean about what has occurred here. The Australian people need  to understand why these people who are accused of such serious crimes are detained in such a low security environment and in  the second case released into the community on a bridging visa.

Journalist

What should the Government have done?

Michael Keenan

Firstly they need to stop people from coming to Australia in this manner. Secondly if they do come then they need to be secured in  an appropriate place. If you are the subject of an Interpol red notice that is another law enforcement agency saying we believe this  person has committed a serious crime. This is the highest level of notice that can be issued and when somebody like that arrives  illegally in Australia by boat they should not be put into a low security facility.

Journalist

Where should they have gone into? Prison? What could the Government have done?

Michael Keenan

They need to detain them within an appropriate environment and the fact that Inverbrackie is a low security detention facility  means it wasn’t an appropriate environment. That was admitted by the Government as when this appeared in the media they  moved that man to a more secure environment in Villawood. Now Villawood itself contains a lower security section as well as a  maximum security section and the Government hasn’t been forthcoming about where this individual is being kept. But the idea  that he spent nearly a year in such a low security environment from which he could have easily escaped and from which there has  been a significant number of escapes before, is quite frankly beyond belief and represents a very serious breach of national  security.

Journalist

Could there be more people like this with charges against them in the community on bridging visas or in Villawood or Inverbrackie  or other low security detention centres?

Michael Keenan

Sadly I think there is potential for more cases like this to occur. We only know about these particular cases because they were  raised in the media not because the Government came clean about what has actually been occurring in our detention network.

Well given this could be your problem in four months what are you going to do about it?

Michael Keenan

Firstly we need to stop people from coming to Australia in this manner.

Journalist

But that isn’t going to happen straight away.

Michael Keenan

When you have 42,000 people arriving here illegally by boat courtesy of people smugglers clearly that is a weakness that  criminals will seek to take advantage of and that is what has been occurring. We will make sure that anybody who is a threat to  the community is detained appropriately.

Journalist

Is there a timeframe for stopping the boats?

Michael Keenan

We believe that our policies will have an immediate effect and I believe that people smugglers are very aware that we are serious  about closing them down. If we are successful at the election then I think our policies will have an impact straight away.

Journalist

In terms of a breach of national security do you share the concerns with the Labor MP who has raised concerns about the  efficiency dividend on these security agencies? Is that something that the Coalition would restore or would you take away that  efficiency dividend from those national security agencies?

Michael Keenan

That is a very important point. Yesterday we heard Labor’s chair of the intelligence committee say that the budget cuts that Labor  has inflicted on our intelligence agencies were having a very bad effect on their ability to do their job. I might say in the case of the  Egyptian that I have raised, you would expect that he would go through a vetting process at ASIO but the point is that ASIO are  under enormous pressure because they have had significant budget cuts. Astonishingly their budget to actually screen asylum  seekers has been cut significantly and clearly that means cases like this have the ability to slip through the Government’s fingers  and those cuts are extremely damaging at a time when ASIO are under pressure.

Journalist

Would your first priority be to restore these cuts?

Michael Keenan

We will always prioritise frontline law and order services and frontline national security services.

Journalist

Do you think it is appropriate for political parties to get more public funding for election campaigning?

Michael Keenan

I am aware of this in the broadest possible sense but I don’t know the details so you should direct that question to the relevant  Shadow Minister.

Journalist

What sort of debate is the Coalition going to have this morning on the paid parental leave scheme?

I am not sure I will have to wait and see.

Journalist

Inaudible

Michael Keenan

No I don’t. It is Coalition policy.

Journalist

Inaudible

Michael Keenan

I am not aware of those concerns. It is Coalition policy and it is about time that Australia had a bona fide paid parental leave  scheme.

Journalist

Inaudible

Michael Keenan

I will leave that to him to comment on.
