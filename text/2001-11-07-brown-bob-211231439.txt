Howard Must Release Video Tape - Brown

Claims by naval personnel that asylum seekers did not throw their children into the water last month, as alleged by Immigration Minister Mr Ruddock and Defence Minister Reith, present a prima facie case that the ministers have mislead the Australian public, Greens Senator Bob Brown said today.

“This matter brings into question the integrity of senior Government ministers. Their allegations that asylum seekers threw their children into the water were based on unnamed naval sources. Now we have unnamed naval sources saying the exact opposite,” Senator Brown said.

“The ministers must release the video tape of the incidents or the public will have little choice but to believe that the ministers have deceived Auatrlians.

“I call on Mr Howard to intervene and release the video.

“Vilification of asylum seekers appears to have gone beyond prejudice to the point of fabrication. This harms not only the asylum seekers but the Australian people’s right to be informed truthfully,” Senator Brown said.

Senator Brown has demanded the video tape of the incident be released before Friday.
