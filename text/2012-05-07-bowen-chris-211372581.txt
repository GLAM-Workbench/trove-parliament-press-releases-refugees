Chris Bowen MP  Minister for Immigration and Citizenship

27 boats but Tony Abbott is still saying 'no'  Monday, 07 May 2012

Joint media release with Chris Bowen MP - Minister for Immigration and  Citizenship and Jason Clare MP - Minister for Home Affairs, Minister for  Justice and Minister for Defence Materiel.

The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Chris Bowen MP, and Minister for  Home Affairs, Jason Clare MP, said the two asylum seeker boats intercepted today  are the 26th and 27th since Tony Abbott said 'no' to offshore processing.

Mr Bowen said that as the Government had repeatedly warned, more boats continue  to arrive without a real deterrent in place.

'Mr Abbott continues to say 'no' to the national interest - he's only concerned with  negativity, cheap slogans and his personal interest,' Mr Bowen said.

'Australians have no choice but to conclude that Mr Abbott prefers to see more boats  arrive to gain cheap political points.

'As all the expert advice to Government says, we need a genuine deterrent to stop  people from taking these dangerous boat journeys—but the Coalition continues to  stand in the way of offshore processing.

'Remember what this is all about—200 people died last year off the coast of  Indonesia. Another 11 people died off the coast of Malaysia in February,' Mr Clare  said.

'We can stop this—but it requires legislation. That means it requires both sides to  work together.

'It's time Tony Abbott stopped saying no and voted to allow offshore processing in  Malaysia and Nauru.'
