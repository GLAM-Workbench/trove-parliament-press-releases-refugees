PRIME MINISTER

TRANSCRIPT OF PRESS CONFERENCE,  ORIENTAL HOTEL,  BANGKOK  2 FEBRUARY 1989

E & ÃÂ E - PROOF ONLY

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister,  are you disappointed that Bill Kelty has described the idea of taking housing out of the CPI  for wages purposes as conceptually flawed?

PM: No, I don't make any judgement on that statement of Bill  Kelty's. I know that the ACTU is agreeing with the idea of  examining the way in which the issue is being treated. Out  of that discussion that will take place we would hope to get

a process which is most appropriate for all purposes for  which the CPI is used. I don't get upset by that comment by  Mr Kelty.

JOURNALIST: But it does seem to make it less likely that  your proposal will get carried through.

PM: Well we'll see what happens.  The Statistician himself  has indicated that they're going to have a look at it, all  the parties I think agree that it ought to be looked at,  let’s see what happens.

JOURNALIST: Are you as confident "as you were the other day  Mr Hawke that you can reach some arrangement with the ACTU  about housing components for the last couple of quarters?

PM: The overall point that I am confident about is that the  wages outcome will be negotiated in a way which is relevant  to both the legitimate aspirations of the Australian  workforce - and they do have legitimate aspirations to  maintaining and gradually through time improving their living

standards. The equally important consideration which is in  our mind is maintaining responsible economic management in  the context of the circumstances,  including the external  circumstances, with which we’re confronted. I'm confident on  the experience of tt)e last few years that the trade union  movement and the Government, together with input from the  employers will get an outcome which is relevant to those two  considerations.  I've been confident about that all along, I  have no reason to doubt that we can get that outcome.

JOURNALIST:  It would be disastrous wouldn't it if wages were to rise at the same sort of level as prices are now rising,   wouldn't it?

PM: It would be disastrous if the wages outcome were not  consistent with the capacity of the economy to sustain living  standards and not impose too great a strain on the external  account.  Those are the criteria. I made it clear that a  wages outcome which is not consistent with those criteria is  not acceptable.

JOURNALIST: Back in '85 you agreed to delay tax cuts for  three months because of the economic situation. Would you be  prepared to contemplate delaying tax cuts this time for all

PM: That question hasn't arisen in my thinking at this  stage.

JOURNALIST: There's been a suggestion that there be some  special allowance or weighting for people in Sydney because  of the housing cost. What do you say to that?

PM: I haven't addressed ray mind to a particular weighting for Sydney people. I think that's just an issue that may  arise in the discussions but I'm not going to prejudge that  suggestion. On it's face I don't get terribly excited about

it.

JOURNALIST: ... Bangkok,  is it possible to ask a question about your meeting with the Thai leadership?

PM: Perfectly possible Peter.

JOURNALIST: Do you think Prime Minister that you'll be getting the support from the Thais for the regional trading  bloc group/alliance, call it what you will, that you hoped  for in Korea?

PM: I've to meet with the Prime Minister and other Ministers  later this morning.  I would hope that at the least they  would find the concept one which is worth further analysis  and discussion.  I would hope and expect to get that reaction

and I'll find out when I talk with the Prime Minister a bit  later this morning.

JOURNALIST: Is Kampuchea on the agenda today and what  aspects will you discuss?

PM: You couldn't be here and not have Kampuchea on the agenda. Yes, it will be discussed and both the external and  the internal aspects will be discussed.  The external aspects

being of course the withdrawal of tfhe Vietnamese troops and  the phasing down of external assistance to the factions  within Kampuchea.  And then of course,  internally, what will  be the processes leading to an acceptable government within

Kampuchea. Those are the essential issues and that's what  I'll be discussing.

JOURNALIST:  ... putting regarding some possible  international body and Australia's possible part in it?

PM: Well those discussions about what is now talked of as an  international control mechanism, the word mechanism being a  generalised phrase to cover the differences which have  existed between the concept of an international peace-keeping

force on the one hand what some elements ... and on the other  just a monitoring body, it is now referred to as a mechanism.  Well I want to find out from talking to the Prime Minister  and the Foreign Minister here just the latest thinking

amongst the various parties and they are absolutely up to  date with that about where the areas of difference are on  that concept. Essentially what I will be indicating as far

as Australia is concerned is that as an interested party and  one with a record of concerned involvement on this issue  Australia would stand ready to be of assistance in any sort  of mechanism, if we can use the word that's in vogue now, if

our presence is desired. But I repeat, we are not here to  push ourselves in as a participant in the final supervising  process whatever form that might take but if it were regarded  as desirable by the parties concerned then obviously,  consistent with our past concern and involvement, we would be  prepared to consider that.

JOURNALIST: Do you think it would be regarded as desirable?

PM: By the parties? Well, I would tend to think so. Not  every party would have exactly the same attitude by  definition because you have such a range of parties. But I  think generally speaking Australia's standing is such that

they would regard it as sensible for Australia to have some  involvement.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, there have been reports from Peking that Gareth Evans after his round of talks is  pessimistic of an early Cambodian settlement, do you share  that pessimism?

PM: I don't accept that he has it.

JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke the official figures show that the performance of Australian exporters in Thailand has been  fairly mediocre. Are the faults all on the Australian side?

PM: Well let's just get that in perspective. There h-as been a doubling of the performance in the last couple of years which  is admittedly from a low base but it is not right to say that  the movement is not substantial and in the right direction. But I think you are right in saying that compared with our

trading relations with other countries in the region,  in absolute terms its not as high as we would like. And in  fact I will be proposing to the Prime Minister and other

4

Ministers a process whereby we can see a further significant  improvement in that in the couple of years ahead. I think  that there is a case to be argued that Australian businessmen  haven't been as enterprising in Thailand as they should have  been.  The opportunities here are obviously very significant,  and it is a country which is in a period of rapid economic  growth with needs to greatly enlarge its infrastructure,

significant demands for a range of materials of imports as  well as manufactured goods. Now I think the opportunities,  generally speaking haven't been grasped or pursued as  vigorously as they might have been by Australian business.

Always there will be some difficulties and you could point to  some problems in the country concerned and there would be  some here.  But what we are about on this occasion is to try  and create the framework at the government level, government  to government level, which will ensure that the environment

is there for the Australian business community,  both the  private sector to the extent that public utilities would also  have a role,  that the environment will be right for them to

take advantage of very significant opportunties that  undoubtedly exist here.
