ANTHONY ALBANESE:    The Government welcomes this study into  high-speed rail by Infrastructure Partnerships  Australia done in conjunction with AECOM. This  is a welcome contribution to the debate. Its  theme is in line with the Government's  approach to infrastructure development - that  we need a considered approach that deals with  the strategic planning that is necessary.

What this report says is that we need to look at

preserving the corridor from Brisbane right  through to Melbourne in order to save costs for  what is a long-term vision for high-speed rail  down the east coast of Australia.

We know that high-speed rail is making a big

difference in Europe and in Asia. We know that  there are challenges here in Australia because  of the relatively small population compared  with, say, China or Japan. But what we need to

do is to take the general support that is there  for high-speed rail and have a thorough  examination.

That's why during the election campaign the

Gillard Government announced that we would  allocate $20 million into a high-level feasibility  study for the eastern seaboard corridor,  concentrating on the Sydney to Newcastle  route.

We need to look at the geotechnical challenges

that are there due to the geography of that  route. We need to define what the precise  costs are and identify the corridor. We need to  look at the economics and financing of such a  project, including the possibility of some  private sector financing being an option.

We know that high-speed rail has a number of

advantages. It can get people from A to B very  quickly and conveniently; unlike air travel, it  can put people right in the centre of a capital  city; and it can also be part of the whole-of-government approach to tackling climate  change. We know that rail is particularly  climate friendly in terms of a form of transport,  and we need to take this to the next step.

This is a valuable contribution to informing the

$20 million feasibility study that the Gillard  Government will conduct into a high-speed rail  corridor.

Happy to take questions, if you've got any.

QUESTION:                  When you say this is a long-term project, is it a  pie in the sky? Is it - do we ever have a time  frame for this [indistinct]?

ANTHONY ALBANESE:    I'm very hopeful that when we look at this -  the economics and financing of this proposal -  that it will stack up, and then we can put a  timeline to it.

It's pretty clear that there's a lot of public

support for high-speed rail, but before now it's  been theoretical. There hasn't been a thorough  examination of the costs, of the routes, of the  geotechnical issues associated with developing  a high-speed rail network down the eastern  seaboard. So we know that there's public  support for it. What we need to do is put  dollars next to this proposal and then have a  debate in the community about whether they  want it to go forward.

The reason why we've chosen Sydney to

Newcastle for a concentrated look is that is the  area which has the highest density of  population. And it's pretty clear from this  report and other studies that have been done  that it's the density of population that's  important. You need to have, essentially, the  passenger numbers in order for the economics  of high-speed rail to stack up. That's why

Sydney to Newcastle, as a first step, would be  considered.

QUESTION:                  But there's no date at all? There's no - you can't  give us anything?

ANTHONY ALBANESE:    What we're doing is having a proper study.  That study will look at what the economics are  and look at time lines for investment.

What this report shows is that we need to - if it

is going to move forward - to preserve the  corridor. That's what we did with the inland rail  study where we had a study and now the  Government will allocate funds for the  preservation of that corridor.

What we need to do is not be in a situation

whereby in five or 10 years time people say  'high-speed rail's a good idea but it can't go  ahead because the costs are just too much'.

QUESTION:                  [Interrupts] Why has it taken...

ANTHONY ALBANESE:    What this report shows...

QUESTION:                  Why has it taken so long in the first place? I  mean, you're saying 10, 15 years' time.

ANTHONY ALBANESE:    No, I'm not saying it has to happen in 10 or 15  years time. What I'm saying is we need a  considered approach so that it can move  forward. The way infrastructure should be

done is to have a proper examination, find out  the feasibility, find out the costs and then go  forward. I'm very confident that high-speed rail  will be a part of Australia's transport and  infrastructure future. What we need to do is  make sure we get the planning right.

This report is a valuable contribution to that,

and I look forward to receiving that report in  the coming year and then being in a position to  make decisions as to time lines, as to the  preservation of the corridor and, if the  recommendations show that it stacks up, then  to have a debate about time lines for the  actual construction in terms of a first stage  from Sydney to Newcastle.  But in the longer  term, a high-speed rail network right down the  eastern seaboard corridor.

QUESTION:                  And is there any country that you're modelling  it on?

ANTHONY ALBANESE:    What we will do is look at all of the overseas  experience - be it in Europe, be it in Asia. We  know that there are a number of high-speed  rail projects being rolled out, particularly in  China, at the moment. Of course, China has a  substantially higher density of population. So  we need to look at the lessons that are there  and take all of that on board in terms of this  study to make sure that we get it right.

I think high-speed rail is an important part of

our future. We need to make sure that we get  the economics of it right because it has  significant benefits for our economy, for our  environment and I think will make a big  difference in terms of overcoming the tyranny  of distance, which in a country such as ours  has been such a challenge.

QUESTION:                  Can you tell us a bit more about Sydney to  Melbourne three hour trips?

ANTHONY ALBANESE:    This report indicates that Sydney to Melbourne  could be conducted in three hours. The  advantage, of course, is that it could be  Sydney CBD right in to Melbourne CBD with no  waiting, as opposed to the time that air travel  takes - waiting at the airport and travelling to  and from the airport at either end. So it's  pretty clear that there are a number of  advantages that high-speed rail would have.

We're concentrating on the eastern seaboard

from Brisbane right through to Melbourne, and  it could make a substantial difference.  In  terms of Sydney to Newcastle, it could cut  down the time of that travel to just over half  an hour.  That would bring enormous  opportunities, particularly in terms of regional  development, to an area such as the Hunter.

QUESTION:                  Can you guarantee that it will be a cheaper  alternative to flying?

ANTHONY ALBANESE:    No. That is why we're looking at the economics  of the proposal.

QUESTION:                  It's just that flying is, like, shorter time, so why  would people choose to - choose the train if  they can fly cheaper?

ANTHONY ALBANESE:    Well, people take time to get to the airport,  they then wait around at the airport, they then  get on the plane; when they get to the other  end they wait for their bags, they then have to  travel from the airport to their destination -  quite often into the city. There are a number of  advantages, and the European experience  shows that projects such as the Eurostar from  London to Brussels and Paris has been  extremely successful, has been extremely  competitive because of the advances in  technology which are there.

We need to make sure planning for

infrastructure gets ahead of demand and that  we make sure that we're looking forward, that  we're embracing the technologies of the future  - whether it be the National Broadband  Network or whether it be high-speed rail. We  need to make sure that we have a proper  examination of our future infrastructure needs  and that we provide proper analysis of that.  This [IPA/AECOM] report is an important  contribution to it, but we have a much more  detailed report coming as a result of our  election commitment - $20 million to look in  great detail at all of the challenges and to look

at, importantly, the economics and financing of  any high speed rail proposal.

QUESTION:                  As the minister responsible for airports, would  you relish this opportunity if it meant that we  didn't have to build another - second Sydney  airport for a couple of years at least?

ANTHONY ALBANESE:    In terms of Sydney's airport needs, the  Government's made it clear that we think that  Sydney will need a second airport.  High-speed  rail won't solve all the issues in terms of access  to the city.  Aviation will continue to grow and  expand, and all the studies have shown that  Sydney will need a second airport.  That's why  we're having a study in conjunction with the  New South Wales Government into a second  airport as part of Sydney's growing transport  infrastructure needs.

QUESTION:                  Is the minority Parliament - Federal Parliament  finding itself in a convenient excuse to walk  away from a lot of election promises?

ANTHONY ALBANESE:    Not at all. The fact we have inherited the  Parliament that the Australian people voted for  on 21 August. What that means is that there  will need to be negotiation in order to get  legislation through the House of  Representatives and through the Senate. We  think that also presents an opportunity to  change the culture of the Parliament so there's  much more consensus. We intend to work

constructively with the Parliament, with our  parliamentary colleagues - be they members  of the Coalition, or be they members of  minority parties.

QUESTION:                  Do you think we'll see a price on carbon in the  next three years after your leader ruled it out  during the election campaign?

ANTHONY ALBANESE:    What Julia Gillard, the Prime Minister, has said  very clearly is that we have inherited a  Parliament that was elected on 21 August, and  as a result of that we will work in a  collaborative way, including dealing with the  challenges of climate change.

We've said there are a number of priorities for

dealing with climate change. Energy efficiency  is the low hanging fruit. We will also provide  support for renewable energy, and we've said  that there is a need for a price on carbon but  we've referred that to the committee which will  engage in a constructive fashion about  developing a way forward.

QUESTION:                  So is she going to break her election promise or  not? She ruled out a price on carbon. Are we  going to see one [indistinct]?

ANTHONY ALBANESE:    We have established a committee, we will  participate in that committee. I would hope  that all those in the Parliament who support  action on climate change will participate in that

committee in a constructive way. And I note  Malcolm Turnbull has been out there twittering  and on his Facebook page welcoming the  comments of Marius Kloppers from BHP  Billiton.

QUESTION:                  Do you think housing about 1000 extra asylum  seekers at remote defence bases across the  country is a...

ANTHONY ALBANESE:    [Interrupts] Look that's a...

QUESTION:                  ... [indistinct] use of infrastructure?

ANTHONY ALBANESE:    That...

QUESTION:                  You're the Minister for Infrastructure.

ANTHONY ALBANESE:    That's a matter for the Minister for  Immigration.

QUESTION:                  Just back to high-speed rail - this has been  promised for a long time or talked about for a  long time. Can you understand that people  might be sceptical or frustrated that there are  so many studies that need to go ahead before  you can commit to anything?

ANTHONY ALBANESE:    Indeed. What's happened is that there's been  discussion of high-speed rail for a long time.  No one has funded a study such as we're doing  - $20 million to actually look at the financing  and economics of the proposal.  If we're

serious about it, we've got to get down to  identifying the corridor, identifying  geotechnical issues, identifying the financing of  the proposal.  That's what we intend to do.   We need to stop the broad discussion about  high-speed rail. We know that there's broad  support in the community for the concept of  high-speed rail. Let's actually put a route to  that discussion, let's put money next to how  much it would cost as a way forward.

This is the first time that there has been a

serious analysis of the details of high-speed  rail.  I appreciate the fact that it's been  welcomed by the Coalition - during the  campaign they followed our commitment by  supporting it - and also by the Greens and  other minor parties. So there's broad support  for this study. I think it will be important in  terms of making that next step forward.

Thanks very much.
