'NATIONAL AGENDA FOR WOMEN' GRANTS:

PROMOTING WOMEN'S PARTICIPATION

The Federal Government has allocated almost three quarters  of a million dollars to various women's groups to women's  support participation in community affairs.

The grants were announced today by the Minister Assisting  the Prime Minister for the Status of Women, Carmen Lawrence,  under the National Agenda for Women Grants Program.

"Women's groups are essentia l to the process of raising the  status of Australian wome n," Dr Lawrence said.  "The grants have been allocated to a wide variety of groups  including those representing women in the home, rural omen,  ethnic women and supporting mothers.

"The grants will help these groups operate with the same  professionalism and expertise afforded to other major  community groups such as those in the conservation and  ethnic movements. They will expand the capacity of the  organisations to consult, research, community education and  provide input into government decision making," Dr Lawrence

said.

A list of the grants is attached.
