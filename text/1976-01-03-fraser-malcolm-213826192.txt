TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW GIVEN TO PETER COLLINS FROM SATURDAY WEEK

.  '  .  3

COLLINS: To what extent has your life changed since you became Prime :  Minister?

FRASER:; I-think it is difficult to define because there has been a  fairly slow and steady change over a long period. As a

private member I used to be able, to spend:a lot more time  with my family but that was very nearly 10 years ago.  As a

minister and as Leader of the Opposition,  it has meant' more  and more time.away, from Nareen and, also,  unfortunately, more

and more time out of Wannon. Being Prime Minister just  exaggerates allj/bf that. This time of the year, I suppose,

more than any other time I am here‘ 7 .  It will be possible to get tOi Nareen at weekends, occasionally, but probably not very  .  -i  . . .

often."* ~ Ã¢ÂÂ   -

COLLINS: Do yod try to seal yourself off here?

'  Â·  ÃÂª  .  Ã¢ÂÂ

FRASER: Well its nice to be able to seal yourself off it you can. I

think anyone who.leads a fairly busy life needs some way of  escaping. Fishing is one of the best ways, because there is

no media,  no television, no telephones and no newspapers.

But a Prime Minister has to be accessible, and so we have

tfelejphones, there has to be a teleprinter put in so that if

some sort of emergency arises a secure message can be got to

you at a moments notice. You can't really do the job properly  if you are out of contact for even 24 hours, and therefore the  job has to follow you.

What has Nareen meant to you over the years? *

Well it's my home. It's the family's home. I haven't spent  in recent years all that much time here but above all else

it's home for the family and also sometimes a refuge from

politics. - .

How do you think your style of leadership is going to differ  from your predecessor?

Well I don't think I'm the person to make a judgement about

his style of leadership but from my government's point of view I think it is important to emphasise Cabinet responsibility,

the relationship of Cabinet to the Party Room and the process of consultation with the States which has already started in a

way which I don't think occurred on previous occasions, a

relationship with the Public Service which I think is quite different. I trust the Public Service.- I trust the Service's

integrity. Sometimes I might want a bit of prompting to get outside additional advice and build that in to the advice that

the permanent head gives to a Minister, but generally if there is a particular problem under consideration, especially if the

Minister is keen, to do that, and this can all be done  .  r  / — _ '  '  -

harmoniously and not in the competitive manner that seemed to

do so |nuch damage to the Labor Government. If-think establishing 1 a framework that is predictable so that average men and women

in Australia can know what is going to happen and not be worried

about Iwhat the Government is going to do next is important. .  i  '  Â·

Your critics accuse you of being uninterested in areas like"   aborigines, the arts_and the environment - if you like, the

trendy areas. Is that so? ,  I

I don't think that is so. I don't think the facts really bear

‘it rout, because I was a foundation member of the Conservation

Foundation long before it was a trendy or popular issue.

I can remember having discussions with Francis Ratc.liffe in

his house in Canberra as to what ought to be done to try and  get Australia concerned with conservation and environmental

issues. This was long before there was any Conservation

Foundation, long before you would find journalists writing much

about it in the newspapers,  long before there was any real

public awareness of the importance of the issue.  On other  issues, as Education Minister, again the record will show

my Department was concerned, and that I was concerned, about the

problems of education of aborigine children for example in the  Northern Territory. I don't think the record would justify

such-a criticism.

Can I ask you a personal type question? How do you go about  setting goals. Do you.set goals for yourself, and say I'm

going to achieve this by a certain time?

No I don't think so. The only goal you can really set yourself_ is to try and do whatever job you've got at the particular time as well as you possibly can. Now there are many things

involved in being Prime Minister and many different facets of government,  many different policiesdomestic and foreign policies, economic policy, problems"concerned with creation of opportunities, helping the disadvantaged. I don't think

-  ÃÂ¯ -  Â·  ’  .  "  '

you can' set yourself a positive goal, that you are going to get to, a point by a certain time. It's just a question of

doing the job^as, well as you can. "  V  - - .....  '  * "

Were there ever times, for instance around about 1970 when you  ‘  ' 3  .  Â·  '

were Relegated to the back benches after the Gorton business,

when you wondered whether you'd just give up? .  I

I don^t think for long. Somehow or other I don't think it

would have been right to just give up. If you believe in things  andÂ· if other people for better or worse happen to believe in you,

you have obligations to them. You have obligations to your  own electorate. You have a certain view of the kind of -

political party that you believe the Liberal Party was and is

or .ought to be. There was a great dealÂ· to work for.  Ã¢ÂÂ  (

Looking back on the past election campaign and the events

leading up to it, to what extent were you able to plan things

out,  to map out the alternatives available both to you and .   to Mr Whitlam? .

I think fairly carefully. I think Mr Whitlam. made a great-

error.of judgement in assuming that under all circumstances

the Governor-General would have to accept the Prime Minister

of the days advice because, well, there's no need to revive  history but I have always believed that there were circumstances

in which there was an independent capacity on the part of the

Governor-General in Australia, on behalf of the Queen in the  United Kingdom. That proved to be correct. It was also .   not conceivable that the stale-mate should be allowed to

continue throughout the summer months. It was never conceivable

that a half Senate election was really a solution to the  Constitutional difficulty that had arisen and that, if you like,

was another miscalculation of Mr Whitlam's. We also thought  that there was going to be difficulty until we actually got

intoÃ¢ÂÂ an election. Once an election was on, I believed that ' Ã¢ÂÂ¢  * * \ Â· ;v ** Â·

people would .focus on the economic issues, on -the kind of .

government they had had for three years and that they would

seriously ask~~themselves whether they wanted that sort of

government for the next'three years. So it could be thought

through, and was. thought.through, fairly carefully. But you can

never-  guarantee things in politics. It depends upon the judgement  of a very large number of people.  .

i

1975 has been a very spectacular year for you. What do you  look forward to in 1976?

I think a more predictable.world for all Australians.

We want a situation where people who have retired won't have  their savings destroyed. We want to establish a situation

whtere school leavers in the future are going to be able to

get jobs, where university students are going to be able to use

their skills. Now with what has been predicted and is still  predicted as a result of past policies for this summer, there

are going to be many people not in that situation, many .

school leavers, many university students who won't get the ,

FlVASER:  CONT.  sort of job they basically want or seek.  We want to establish a situation where people don't have to be worried about what

the government is going to do from one day or one week to the

next,  where people know that the government is there to help

them and not to hinder them achieving their own personal or family ambitions. We want to build a better Australia for

everyone. It is a land .of opportunity. The government

has a significant part in achieving that. We can't make sure the people take advantage of opportunity that might be

available, that is up to the individuals themselves. We can do a great deal to see that the opportunities are there.  We

have got to get confidence in industry and investment moving forward,  or there won't be the jobs,  there won't be rhe

opportunities and we won't have the wealth provided for the sort of. education we want for our children. We won't have

the wealth that is necessary to be able to look after those who are disadvantaged in one way or another. I also want to see in 1976 the first significant moves towards the most

far sighted changes in our Federalism system of government

that have probably been introduced since Federation itself. .  '  Â· Â«  . . .  Â·  '  '

COLLINS: You mean give back special powers to the States?

FRASER:  .  / /  ^ ...

Well giving financial independence...to the States in a realistic

form ahd at the same time giving greater financial autonomy to local -government.  Loc,al government used to look after roads .

and almost nothing but.  They've had responsibility heaped on them by State Governments. ,  by Federal Governments and, still in

largejmeasure,  it is the rate payers who bear the significant burden' .  Â·  Now they need access to the general pool of taxation and; that's been part.of our policy. We've got to move some

power, I believe away from Canberra. '  In a country that is as diverse as Australia and in a country as well educated as Ã¢ÂÂ

Australia basically is, w e ’ve got to see that more people participate in the decision making processes. This means

making local government more independent.  It certainly means

making state governments more independent". We don't want

people in Canberra monitoring both, and telling local government and telling state governments what they must do and how they must

do it because we don't believe that these things should always be done in Canberra. We believe that very often state governments' I

~ on a new basis of co-operation between local government, the

states and the Federal Government and the first meeting in  relation to these matters we hope will be on the 4th and 5th of

February. The Premiers have certainly been asked to come to  a meeting and I hope the dates suit them. .  '

COLLINS: Do you think that Australians then can look forward to a happier or prosperous year in 1976?

FRASER:

; >

I

Well I believe so but I have always said that it is going to be.

hard and difficult to get out of the problems that haye been  caused by Labor.  The deficit over two years is very nearly .

$7,000. million. That has to be paid for, either by inflation  .which is the process Labor was using, or by restraint on the

part of governments, or by increased production which brings  greater wealth and greater revenue consequently. We hope

and plan that it will be done- by ..-restraint, by getting  production moving again and the Commonwealth's revenue

increased:;- real revenue, not through the process of inflation. r . Â·  -  ' Â·  ‘

We will work o'ur way out of the deficit caused by Labor, but  it is riot going to be easy. It is going to be difficult., The

hand-odt mentality that Labor fostered so much has got to -’ . -*v.Ã¢ÂÂ

become,a thing of the past. One of the things they tried to

suggest was that the hand-out mentality was the same as doing things  for the disadvantaged but it is not. Doing things for the Â·  '

disadvantaged is one thing-, - but the Labor-Party shuffled money  aroundi as though it were chaff. That is one of the reasons,

we're in such a difficulty at the moment. . .
