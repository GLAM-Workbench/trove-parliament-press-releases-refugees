ROWAN RAMSEY MP  Member for Grey  Media Release



Election date announcement welcome news

Prime Minister Julia Gillard’s announcement yesterday of a September 14 election was welcomed by Federal  Member for Grey Rowan Ramsey.

Mr Ramsey said the announcement will ensure that in the coming seven months every conversation will be  viewed through the prism of a looming election.

“I believe this announcement is more about the PM shoring up her leadership than ending the speculation of  an election date, but I am pleased we have a clear date to work towards,” he said.

“The Coalition is well prepared for an election anytime, Tony Abbott has released the Coalition’s ‘Real  Solutions plan for the Nation’ and I am looking forward to the months ahead”,  Mr Ramsey said.

“I believe this election will be about re-establishing responsible and considered government and bringing the  Federal budget back under control.   “This Government has a disastrous track record of maladministration and expensive programs which have  failed to meet budget.

“The Federal debt is now approaching $160bn with total borrowings of $300bn and with an annual interest  bill in excess of $7bn, we can simply not afford to keep borrowing from our children’s future.”

Mr Ramsey said at the heart of this campaign is the credibility of the Government and the need to re-establish  trust.

“The Prime Minister’s backflip on the carbon tax and abandonment of its central fiscal plan to return the  budget to surplus are just two of the biggest examples. Labor’s totally unfunded announcements on education  and disability, the cost of living, particularly soaring electricity prices are all the things people are concerned

about.”

Mr Ramsey said small business, the biggest employer in the economy, is struggling under a cost and  compliance burden and the Government has made their situation significantly worse.

“A large proportion of the Coalition team comes from regional Australia and we have plans for the  infrastructure backlog which will help us reach our potential,” he said.   “We also have to regain control of our borders, stop the dangerous trade of people-smuggling and the flood of  unauthorised boat arrivals.

“Eight months is a long time but at least we now know when Australians will get to pass judgement on this  Government.”
