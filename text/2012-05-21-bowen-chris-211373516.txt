Chris Bowen MP  Minister for Immigration and Citizenship

An update on community detention  Monday, 21 May 2012

The Federal Government continues to move children and vulnerable families out of  detention facilities, with almost 2000 people currently residing in or transferring into  community-based accommodation.

The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Chris Bowen MP, said as of 18 May  2012, he had approved 4008 people for residence determination - 2145 adults and  1863 children - since the government announced the new community detention  program in October 2010.

Mr Bowen said there were currently 1966 people in or transferring into community  detention, with 635 of those children.

'We now have 71 per cent of all children in the immigration detention network living  in community-based arrangements - that is 635 minors in the community and 281  remaining in detention facilities,' Mr Bowen said.

'This government recognises the importance of the community detention program  and is proud of the success the program has had in delivering appropriate care for  people - especially children - accommodated in the community while their asylum  claims are assessed.

'As always, I would also like to thank organisations such as the Australian Red Cross  for the ongoing work they do with my department in maintaining these programs.'

All eligible unaccompanied minors who arrived in Australia prior to 22 February 2012  have now been moved into community arrangements.

All eligible accompanied children who arrived in Australia prior to 11 February 2012  have now also been granted community placement.

The small number of children who arrived prior to these dates and who remain in  detention are not eligible for community detention due to security, behaviour or risk  requirements.

'Despite unashamed scaremongering from Scott Morrison to score cheap political  points, the reality is that people who are approved for community detention are the  most vulnerable in the network because they are children, families and people with  serious mental or physical health issues,' Mr Bowen said.
