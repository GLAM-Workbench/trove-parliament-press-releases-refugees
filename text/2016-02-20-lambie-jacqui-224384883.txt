Liberal members must support call to increase Federal  Assistance to Local Governments: Lambie

JLN	Independent	Tasmanian	Senator	Jacqui	Lambie	has	called	on	all	Liberal	 members	of	parliament	to	support	her	call	to	unfreeze	the	Federal	Assistance	 Grants	to	local	governments	-	so	that	Tasmanian	ratepayers	won't	get	slugged	with	 unfair	rate	rises.

“I	would	like	Tasmanian	members	of	parliament	like	Brett	Whiteley	MP	and	newly	appointed	 Turnbull	cabinet	minister	Senator	Colebeck	to	muscle	up,	put	their	state	first	and	place	pressure	on	 the	Liberal	government,	to	unfreeze	the	indexation	on	local	government’s	federal	assistance	 grants.”	said	Senator	Lambie.



In	a	YouTube	Video	Senator	Lambie	said:

“Are	your	rates	too	high?	The	federal	government	provided	Assistance	Grants	for	41	years	to	every	 council	in	Australia	-	which	kept	our	rates	lower.

But	the	Liberal	Government	decided	to	freeze	the	indexation	on	those	grants.	They	say	it	will	save	 the	Federal	Government	$925M.	This	is	at	the	same	time	the	government	will	spend	$830M	 resettling	Syrian	and	Iraqi	refugees.

I	want	all	politicians	including	the	Liberals	to	agree	to	fairly	increase	federal	assistance	to	local	 councils.	Put	Australians	first.”
