IT’S TIME TO WORK TOGETHER TO STOP MORE PEOPLE DYING AT SEA

30 April 2012

Minister for Home Affairs, Minister for Justice and Acting Minister Immigration  Jason Clare today called on the Opposition to work with the Government to stop  people making the dangerous journey by sea to Australia.

This follows the arrival of the 25th asylum seeker boat since Tony Abbott said no  to offshore processing.

“The Australian people expect better than a slanging match - they expect us to  work together to stop people dying at sea,” Mr Clare said.

“Remember what this is all about - 200 people died last year off the coast of  Indonesia.

“Another 11 people died off the coast of Malaysia in February.

“We can stop this - but it requires legislation. That means it requires both sides  to work together.

“We need to put our swords down and agree to do this now before more people  die.”
