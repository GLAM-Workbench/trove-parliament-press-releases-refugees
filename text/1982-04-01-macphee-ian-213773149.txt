THE HON IAN MACPHEE,  M.P.

24/82 .  '  1 April 1982

CLOSE FAMILY BETTER OFF UNDER NEW MIGRATION SYSTEM

Brothers,  sisters and non-dependent children of Australian

residents will gain concessional points that give them a better

chance of acceptance under the new migrant selection system to  be Introduced on 19 April.

/ Â·

Further details of the system were released today by the  Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs,  Mr Ian MacpheeÂ·

"The Government is determined to be as open as possible  in the administration of the new system," Mr Macphee said. "A

range of leaflets has been prepared outlining the new  requirements and will be made available shortly.

"In addition,  the new Migrant Handbook containing instructions  to Migration Officers will be available to members of the public

who want more detailed information on the operation of the new

system The Handbook will be available for public inspection  at Departmental offices from 19 April and on sale soon after at  Australian Government Publishing Service bookshops.

"These moves will help sponsors and applicants understand  how decisions affecting them are made".

The new system is detailed in the attached information paper .

which sets put the factors and the points system used in the  new Economic/Employment Assessment,  details of the new Settlement  Assessment.  the Sponsorship System and the new Assurance of Support.

"To be considered under the new system.  applicants will

normally have to be sponsored by a close relative or have an  occupation in demand ."Mr Macphee said "They will then have to

reach a minimum of 60 points out of a possible 100 on the

Economic/Employment Assessment to be approved.

"But brothers and sisters, as well as non-dependent children,

of Australian residents will automatically obtain 25 points  in return for their sponsor undertaking to provide support,   if necessary.  for one year after arrival. This represents a

significant concession and should help many to pass who would

not pass under the previous system.

"Working-age parents who have the firm support of a sponsorÂ­

ship will be able to enter without an Economic/Employment  Assessment. If they intend to work,  evidence of a firm job  offer will be a requirement." .

The Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs will verify

the sponsor’s ability to live up to the obligations of sponsorship.  People whose sponsorships are rejected may have their case reviewed  by the recently-established independent Immigration Review Panel.

The Panel may also review refusals to allow sponsored relatives  to migrate. .

The Minister announced the abolition of the patrials category.   under which children and grandchildren of people born in Ã¢ÂÂ ’Â·  '   Australia could migrate on a concessionary basis. Introduced

in 1975 for UK citizens,  it was extended last October to citizens  of all countries. The Government has decided to drop this category

following advice from the Commissioner for Community Relations  that it discriminated between people who acquired Australian  citizenship by birth and those who acquired it by naturalisation

Few people enter as patrials:  in 1980/81 there were only 79 -

"The effect of the new system will be to increase family  migration at the expense of independent migration," Mr Macphee

said.

AUSTRALIA'S MIGRANT SELECTION SYSTEM  INFORMATION PAPER ON OPERATION OF THE SYSTEM

1 i

In a statement to Parliament on 29 October 1981 the Â·   Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs outlined a new  migration pplicy, which will come into effect on  19 April 1982 Ã¢ÂÂ This paper gives details of a number of  aspects of the operation of the new policy which were not  covered in detail in the Minister's statement - the  Economic/Employment Assessment, the Settlement Assessment,

the Sponsorship System, the Assurance of Support and  arranged employment.

MIGRATION CATEGORIES .

The five eligibility categories of the new policy were set  out in the Minister's statement of 29 October.

Broadly speaking,  the following groups of people can be  considered for migration: .

FAMILY MIGRATION .

.  -People who have a spouse, parent, child,  brother, sister or fiance resident in  Australia who can sponsor them and provide  support after arrival in Australia.

LABOUR SHORTAGE AND BUSINESS MIGRATION

. People in an occupation which is in demand in  Australia. .

.  People who have been nominated by an Australian employer for a specific job under  the Employment Nomination Scheme..

.  Experienced business people with definite  proposals and sufficient capital to set up  substantial enterprises of value toy Australia  and self-employed people with capital and  demonstrated success in certain areas of  expertise.

2.

OTHER

%

under other categories but who have  outstanding characteristics of obvious benefit  to Australia.

The policy also makes provision for refugees, displaced  persons and others seeking entry to Australia on  humanitarian grounds. New Zealand passport holders  continue to be exempt from visa requirements.

Selection and Assessment

Standard requirements for all migrants are good health and  good character. .

Prospective migrants are also further assessed in two ways:

. Economic/Employment Assessment (the points system):  Labour Shortage and Business Migrants must undergo this assessment.   Sponsored adult children, brothers and sisters  are also considered in this way, but they may

receive additional points according to the  degree of support provided by their sponsor.

. Settlement Assessement: Nearly all migrants are subject to this assessment.

Safeguards in the Family Migration Category

The re-uniting of families is an important objective of  migration policy. Apart from the compassionate side of  the policy, such families are likely to devote their  energy and enthusiasm to the benefit of the Australian  community and add to the vitality and diversity of life in  Australia. On the other hand, a number of migrants in

this category (e.g. aged parents) may require social  welfare and health support; others may have trouble

People who wish to retire in Australia.  Applicants must have reached Australian  retirement age (60 years for women, 65 for  men).  They need to have substantial

transferable assets sufficient to establish a  home in Australia and to provide adequately  for their future, including any care and  support services likely to be required.

People with a record of achievement in  creative or sporting fields which would  benefit Australia.

A small number of people who are not eligible

finding a job. It would be unfair on the community at  large and on the migrants themselves not to have  safeguards for this category to minimise settlement  problems. The safeguards are:

. Sponsorship: All family migrants must be sponsored by Australian relatives who  undertake to give support to the migrant.

.  Assurance of Support: The Assurance is required in cases where the migrant is  unlikely to be able to support himself for a  period and might require the payment of

Special Benefit by the Commonwealth or support  from State Governments or private agencies.

. Arranged Employment: This is required in  cases where the migrant may experience  difficulty in obtaining employment on arrival.

A summary of sponsorship and selection requirements  applying to each category is set out at Attachment A.

ECONOMIC/EMPLOYMENT ASSESSMENT

This is an objective assessment, which allocates points  for a number of factors, designed to test an applicant's  prospects of obtaining employment and being able to  support himself and his family in Australia.

The factors in the Economie/Employment Assessment and the  range of points applying to each factor are as follows:

Growth Area Applicant intends to settle in  designatedÂ· growth area 6

Applicants must obtain 60 points out of 100 in order to  pass. Non-dependent children, brothers and sisters who  are fully sponsored (see 'sponsorship' below)  automatically score 25 points on the Economic Viability

factor.

Details of the individual factors are as follows;

SKILL LEVEL; Points are awarded according to the  skill level of the occupation which the applicant  intends to follow in Australia. Persons who are  professional, technical or skilled workers must  have their qualifications recognised in Australia

to gain full points.

5.

OCCUPATIONAL DEMAND: The assessment is made on the basis of the Occupational Demand Schedule  which is a list of occupations prepared by the  Department of Employment and Youth Affairs showing

the demand situation in each State. Full points  on this factor are also awarded to applicants who  are the subject of an approved Employment  Nomination.

ARRANGED EMPLOYMENT: Points are awarded under this factor if an applicant has a specific job to  go to in Australia. The Department of Immigration  and Ethnic Affairs must receive confirmation of

the employment offer from the employer.

AGE: The points on this factor favour those considered to have the optimum combination of  youth and experience to settle here. They take  account of the high incidence of unemployment  among very young workers and the difficulties

facing many older workers in gaining employment.

ENGLISH: Points are awarded under this factor depending on an applicant's competence in the  English language or ability to learn it. Indicators used in determing ability to learn are  a knowledge of other languages, the applicant's

fluency in his own language, good level of  education, youth, an interest in learning English,  and whether the person has an understanding of  problems likely to arise if English is not learnt.

EDUCATION: Points are awarded according to the applicant's level of education overseas.  Recognition of qualifications in Australia is not  taken into account in this factor.

OTHER OCCUPATIONAL ATTRIBUTES: This factor is rated separately from such matters as level of ,   skill, demand for the applicant's occupation in  Australia and the existence of an employment offer

in Australia. It involves assessment of such  matters as the applicant's experience in the  proposed field of employment and record of  employment.

ECONOMIC VIABILITY: This factor involves assessment of an applicant's likely ability to  support himself or his family in Australia.  Considerations taken' into account in scoring are

size and composition of the family group, ages and  degree of dependence of the children, likely  family incomes, past performance in earning a  living, whether the family will arrive in  Australia in debt, the amount of available

6.

capital, any pension or annuity which will  continue permanently in Australia and any support  promised by a migrant organisation in Australia.

GROWTH AREA: An applicant who intends to settle in an area to which a State or Territory wishes to  attract migrants may obtain additional points  under this factor.

SETTLEMENT ASSESSMENT

In the Settlement Assessment the selection officer makes a  judgment about the applicant's, or where there are family  members, the applicant and his family's ability to make a  successful transition to life in Australia. In making

this judgment, the selection officer considers the  applicant under three headings:

.  ability tti cope with migration  . capacity to adjust to Australian society  . whether the applicant's family is supportive  and cohesive.

The Settlement Assessment is not made on a points system.  The applicant may be rated 'outstanding', 'good',  'satisfactory', 'urisatisfaictory'  or 'settlement risk'.

In making an assessment, the selection officer may  consider the folldwing settlement indicators:

Ability to cope with migration:

. Evidence of adaptability, resourcefulness and  independence

- age in relation to maturity and likely  flexibility - likely capacity to cope with changes in  lifestyle, such as fall in income or

different type of housing - previous experience in coping with  changes in lifestyle

. Evidence of preparedness for migration

- whether the family has made enquiries  about Australia - knowledge of, or links with Australia

. Awareness of implicatioris of migration

- whether expectations are realistic - whether the family understands that they  may feel loss or alienation for a while

7.

- whether the reasons for migrating are  positive or negative - whether a situation of conflict or failure is principal reason for

migration. .

. Ability to cope with the stress of migration

- whether likely problems have been  anticipated - experience of other situations of stress  in the family, such as other members

migrating, or economic hardship.

Capacity to adjust to Australian society:

. Capacity to communicate in Australia

- level of English spoken and comprehended - recognition of the difficulties which a  lack of English may create

. Educational and age levels favourable to learning English

- whether the family members will accept  student status while learning English,  and their likely ability to learn - whether they have a willingness to learn

English

. Likely support from ethnic groups in Australia

- whether there is an established ethnic  group in Australia which can provide  support in the area in which the .   applicant proposes to settle - whether there are existing ties with

this group

- whether the expectation of the level of  support is realistic

. Evidence of tolerance and flexibility

- awareness of options and willingness to  consider them - lack of rigidity in expectations and  approach to problems - attitudes to other national groups - whether he is likely to accept people of

other races, religions and cultures - whether he holds extreme views likely to  put him in conflict with sections of  Australian society.

1

8.

Whether the family is supportive and cohesive:

. Effect of significant events in the family

- what has been the effect of events such  as a recent marriage, death, divorce,  birth etc.

. Attitude of spouse and teenage children

- whether they are in favour of the  changes migration will bring - likely effects on family members,  particularly adolescents, of removing

them from a familiar environment - whether they understand that changes  will occur in family relationships, such  as those caused by a spouse working.

SPONSORSHIP

People whose claim for entry to Australia is based on  family connections here must be sponsored by a close  relative. The sponsorship system allows certain  relatives, who might otherwise be rejected, to be  considered for migration because of the support offered by  their relatives in Australia.

The sponsorship system also allows brothers, sisters and  non-dependent children to receive significant additional  points on the Economic/Employment Assessment. In return  for these concessions, the sponsor in Australia must agree  to provide support for his relative.

The policy makes provision for two types of sponsorship -  standard sponsorship and full sponsorship:

STANDARD SPONSORSHIP: By providing this type of sponsorship, a sponsor agrees to provide general  advice and assistance to help his relatives settle  in Australia and to ensure that suitable  accommodation is available on arrival.

FULL SPONSORSHIP: By providing this type of  sponsorship, a sponsor agrees, in addition to the  standard assistance outlined above, to provide any  accommodation and financial assistance that the

sponsored relatives might need for a period of  twelve months after their arrival in Australia.

A brother, sister or non-dependent child (Category 1C) who  has a full sponsorship automatically receives 25 points on  the Economic Viability factor of the Assessment.

r

9.

Sponsors are required to give details of their financial  circumstances and the Department will examine their  ability to meet the commitments they undertake before  accepting a sponsorship. In addition, sponsors will be  asked to provide details of their relative's circumstances

to enable the Department to decide whether an application would be likely to succeed. All sponsorships take the  form of a Statutory Declaration.

ASSURANCE OF SUPPORT

The Assurance of Support replaces and is similar to the  Maintenance Guarantee. Assurances are required for people  who may not be able to support themselves or find work and  who may become a charge on public funds. Examples of such  people are parents or other sponsored relatives within 10  years of the Australian retiring age or older. It does

not apply to sponsored relatives in Family Migration  Category 1C. In an Assurance sponsors are required to  promise to fully support their sponsored relatives for a  specified period and to agree to repay any Special  Benefits paid out by the Commonwealth (or similar

financial benefits from States or charitable institutions)  during that period.

Unlike the Maintenance Guarantee which was often in force  for an indefinite period, Assurances are closely tied to  the period in which the person to be covered might have  difficulty supporting himself (eg an Assurance would be  required for a period of 10 years - the age pension  eligibility period - for a person within 10 years of  retiring age or older). The existence of an Assurance  does not affect eligibility for pensions or benefits; it  places an obligation on the person offering the Assurance  to repay particular benefits. The purpose of the  sponsorship scheme is to require sponsors to take  responsibility for their relatives.

People giving Assurances are required to give details of  their financial circumstances and the Department will,  before accepting an Assurance, examine their ability to  meet the commitments they undertake.

ARRANGED EMPLOYMENT

In some cases, particularly those where it is clear that  major difficulties could be encountered in obtaining  employment, applicants are required to have arranged a job  in Australia before they can be admitted for settlement.  Other applicants may arrange employment if they wish and

receive additional points on the Economic/Employment  Assessment. Â·

10 .

The Department will examine offers of employment to  determine whether they are genuine and meet the  requirements for arranged employment for migration  purposes.

MIGRANT ENTRY HANDBOOK

So that people can understand the basis of decisions by  the Department, the Migrant Entry Handbook, which sets out  detailed procedures and instructions, will be available  for public inspection at offices of the Department from

19 April. It will be on sale through Australian  Government Publishing Service bookshops shortly after that  date. .

REVIEW OF DECISIONS

Under the arrangements for review of decisions set out in  the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs' statement  of 18 January 1982 any sponsor whose relative is not  approved for entry by the Department may have the case

reviewed by the Immigration Review Panel.
