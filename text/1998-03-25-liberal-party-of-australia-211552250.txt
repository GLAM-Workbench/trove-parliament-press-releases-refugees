Cairns migrant settlement review announced

Â

MPS 32/98

Â

The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock, 
today announced th at an independent assessment would be made 
of migrant settlement services in the Cairns and surrounding regions.

Â

Mr Ruddock said the 
key objectives of the assessment are to identify patterns of settlement 
of refugees and migrants and to assess their settlement needs on an 
individual, group and community basis.

Â

"The assessment 
will provide a means of better targeting settlement services to migrants 
and humanitarian entrants in the Cairns region.

Â

"Importantly, it 
will also identify responses that are required to address the needs 
of migrants that may currently exist in the Far North Queensland region".

Â

The Minister announced 
that core funding to the Cairns Migrant Resource Centre will be removed 
from 31 March, 1998.

Â

"This decision 
is due to the Cairns MRC's failure to fulfil its responsibilities under 
a Service Agreement to implement an agreed Work Program.

Â

"The Cairns Migrant 
Resource Centre did not act on the recommendations of an operational 
review conducted in July last year, and it has been affected by a high 
turnover of staff since 1994".

Â

Mr Ruddock said that 
Centacare Cairns had agreed to auspice the MRC's Community Settlement 
Services (CSS) Scheme worker-based grant until alternative service arrangements 
have been established.

Â

"Centacare has 
a proven record of service delivery and was in fact awarded a CSS Scheme 
worker-based grant in the Department's last funding round.

Â

"Discussions with 
the community and other migrant service providers indicate that they 
are supportive of our move to transfer funding to Centacare.

Â

"It is crucial 
that we continue to offer a high quality settlement service to migrants 
who seek to settle in Australia, particularly in non-metropolitan centres 
such as Cairns.

Â

"I remain totally 
committed to the achievement of this objective.

Â

"Furthermore, I 
am determined that all Department of Immigration services are efficient 
and accountable".
