THE HON RICHARD MARLES MP  SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND BORDER  PROTECTION  MEMBER FOR CORIO



E&OE TRANSCRIPT  INTERVIEW with MARIUS BENSON - ABC NEWSRADIO  WEDNESDAY 9 JULY 2014

SUBJECT/S:  Sri Lankan Asylum Seeker vessel

JOURNALIST - MARIUS  BENSON:  Richard  Marles  the  Prime  Minister  has  this   morning said again the asylum seekers being held on an Australian Customs vessel  are  safe  and  that  Australia  is  meeting  its  international  obligations  do  you  accept

that?

RICHARD MARLES, SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND BORDER  PROTECTION:  We’ve got grave concerns about how we can be meeting our  international obligation when we have a processing arrangement at sea which is  treating people in a collective way, how do people’s individual assessments be made  when all the while they’re collectively steaming towards Sri Lanka that’s our concern,  but Marius, we need to be hearing from the Minister today about what their plans  are now in relation to this vessel given the decision of the High Court, we need to be  hearing about exactly what their plans are in terms of how they intend to process  these people, instead what we have is the Minister out of the country, refusing to  answer questions, both he and the Prime Minister citing ‘operational matters’ for the  reason for not answering legitimate questions in the public’s interest - it’s just not  good enough.

BENSON:  And in the absence of any word from the Government, what do you  believe those plans for dealing with these people should be?

MARLES: Well that’s precisely the question the Government should be answering,  we need to be very clear that all of this could have occurred on Christmas Island or  Nauru, we could have had the enhanced screening process being undertaken which  would have had precisely the same effect, but it would have been more thorough,  more transparent, more efficiently done, on Christmas Island or on Manus, instead  what we’re seeing is this Government going through a slap dash process which is

now being challenged in the High Court, we’re seeing Australia’s reputation being  trashed, and it’s simply to protect Scott Morrison’s ego.

BENSON:  You’ve in fact said that the Government has thrown out the human  rights handbook on this and you’re critical of this offshore processing or at least on  sea processing, but critics of Labor say you were the one who introduced enhanced  processing, you tore most of the pages out of the human rights handbook when you  backed offshore processing and the enhanced screening.

MARLES: The enhanced screening process that Labor put in place has played a very  significant role in seeing non-genuine refugees returned to Sri Lanka, that was an  important process to undertake, but that’s not what we’re seeing being implemented  by the Government now on sea, how do people’s individual cases be assessed when  they’ve got different stories, different circumstances, and different strengths to their  case, how do they be individually assessed when all the while they’re on board a  vessel which is steaming towards Sri Lanka, that’s the real issue here, and that’s  why we need to bear in mind that all of this could have occurred on Christmas Island  in a way that would have been much more thorough, much more transparent, to put  precisely the same effect, the only reason that has not occurred is to protect this  Government’s political scoreboard, and as I say in the process we’ve seen Australia’s  reputation trashed, we’ve seen the humanitarian handbook thrown out the window  and the only reason for doing it is to protect Scott Morrison’s ego.

BENSON:  There are reports in Fairfax newspapers this morning of mothers  attempting suicide as a means of reducing their children to orphans and therefore  able to come to Australia in that status, I’ve spoken to Ian Rintoul a refugee  advocate who is in touch with these areas, he says that’s an obscene nonsense, that  that’s not the case, but the Prime Minister was asked about it this morning and said  that the Government wouldn’t give in to moral blackmail.  Do you know the truth or  otherwise of those reports and your view on them?

MARLES:  I don’t know the truth of those reports, I’ve seen them, the point I would  make is that we need to be ensuring as a country that the facilities that we operate  be Manus or Nauru, or for that matter be Christmas Island, which is obviously within  Australian sovereign territory, that these facilities are run in a way that is humane,  dignified and providing safe accommodation.

BENSON:  Richard Marles thank you very much

MARLES: Thank you Marius.
