MORE ASYLUM CLAIMS, SLOWER PROCESSING AND MORE  EXPLOITATION ON DUTTON’S WATCH

New statistics released under an order of production of documents reveal another 1,931  people arrived by plane and claimed asylum in Australia in January - adding to Peter  Dutton’s 100,000-person tally.

The rising number of airplane arrivals claiming asylum represents a work scam run by  people smugglers, pure and simple.

People are being trafficked to Australia on tourist visas, made to apply for asylum, then  being sent to work in exploited conditions on farms or other jobs for the three or so years it  takes to determine the asylum claim.

I was hoping that Peter Dutton would have taken some action to disrupt the people  smuggling operations trafficking migrants through our airports in record numbers.

There's nothing wrong with claiming asylum - it's an important right - but 90 per cent of  these applications are eventually found without merit.

Even Liberal MP Jason Wood belled the cat last February on this crisis occurring on Peter  Dutton’s watch - and still, Mr Dutton has not acted.

Not only are the number of airplane arrivals increasing, the backlog of claims blowing out  even more with 37,913 airplane arrivals in Australia waiting for their refugee status  determination to be finalised.

Most concerningly, the Morrison Government is going slower at deporting people who have  not been granted refugee status - there are 46,391 people waiting for their deportation and  there was only one involuntary deportation in the month of January.

Peter Dutton doesn't have a plan to deal with the record number of asylum claims  occurring on his watch and has no intention to address the further exploitation and slavery-like conditions these trafficked people are experiencing on Australian soil.

These latest statistics show that the people smugglers’ operations are continuing  uninterrupted and, thanks to Peter Dutton’s incompetence and mismanagement, isn’t



getting better anytime soon.
