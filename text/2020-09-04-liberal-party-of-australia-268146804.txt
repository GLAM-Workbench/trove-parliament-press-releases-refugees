Prohibited Items, Door Stop, Parliament House



TOPICS: Prohibited items bill, Biloela family

ALAN TUDGE: Yesterday the Labor Party voted down the Prohibited Items Bill, and in doing so they voted in the interests of vile criminals above innocent children. And frankly I'm disgusted with the way that they voted, and I hope they'll reect on it and change their mind in the Senate. This is a bill which would enable the Australian Border Force ocers to search and seize drugs, weapons, and mobile phones in select instances where they have reasonable suspicion that they are being used in detention centres for the wrong purpose.

Now, over the last two months alone we've had two instances- sorry, over last month alone we've had two instances of vile individuals allegedly disseminating child exploitation materials, using their mobile phone, from the immigration detention networks. And the Australian Border Force ocers who see these individuals have no ability to remove those mobile phones from them. Now, that's just unacceptable. Yes, the police were called but they take 24 hours to get there. How many images were distributed in those 24 hours? In other instances, we've had drugs in plain sight in the immigration detention facilities where, again, the Australian Border Force ocials who look after these facilities have no capacity to be able to remove those drugs. Again, the police have to be called, but what happens in the meantime? The drugs get consumed, they get disseminated, they get destroyed, and they put at risk others. This is such an important bill for the protection of the Australian people, for the protection of children. And I'm so disappointed in the Labor Party that they sided with vile criminals above the interest of innocent Australians, including children.

QUESTION: Minister, isn't this just a Trojan horse for being able to remove mobile phones from immigration detainees?

ALAN TUDGE: It gives the power to Australian Border Force ocers to, in select instances, remove a mobile phone from a detainee. Now, I don't know what sort of evidence the Labor Party needs when you have men literally with child exploitation materials on their mobile phone in the detention network, and distributing that information. And yet we have no power presently to remove that mobile phone.

QUESTION: I mean, you do though, the Australian Federal Police can.

ALAN TUDGE: Well we do, in terms of being able to refer it to the police. And so, in the last instance that took 24 hours, and so how many images were distributed in that meantime?

QUESTION: So, why not just speed up the process with the police?

ALAN TUDGE: We've had instances whereby the victim-, whereby the men who were in the detention centres because of serious crimes, including very serious charges against innocent people, have been harassing their victims using their mobile phone from within the detention network. And again, no ability for the Australian Border Force ocers to remove those mobile phones. We've had instances where drugs have been in plain sight, and again no ability for Australian Border Force ocers to remove the drugs. The police have to be referred to, and in the meantime the drugs can be consumed, putting others at risk …

QUESTION: There's been a large campaign though…

ALAN TUDGE: So, this is not a blanket coverage. This would allow and give the power to the Australian Border Force ocers, when there is a reasonable suspicion that something untoward is going on, to be able to take that action. They have that power at the borders at the moment, and we want them to have that power in the immigration detention facilities. Bearing in mind that 70 per cent of all of the 1500 people in immigration detention facilities today are there because they've been evicted from the country because of serious criminal conduct that they've undertaken in Australia.

QUESTION: What standard of proof is a reasonable suspicion? Or reasonable evidence? What kind of, like is it, are they going to have to see it on the phone? Or can they take the phone and look through it? What's going to go on there?

ALAN TUDGE: Well, clearly if you see an individual carrying a bag of white powder you'll have reasonable suspicion that that could be drugs. If you see a tennis ball being thrown over the security fence and being caught by someone who tries to hide it, clearly there is a reasonable suspicion that that could contain some illicit substances that are being used, and therefore warrants a search. Again, these are powers which Australian Border Force ocers have and exercise reasonably at our borders to keep us safe. And this legislation would simply enable the Australian Border Force ocers to have the power to take reasonable action to keep our immigration detention network safe, and to keep other Australians safe, including children.

QUESTION: But in terms of the phones, like how would that actually work? Would it be sort of random checks of the phones? Would it have to be that phones would be totally thrown out? Like, what sort of burden of proof would have to be there?

ALAN TUDGE: Again, there would be a reasonable suspicion, this would be outlined in the guidelines which the Australian Border Force ocers would have to take.

QUESTION: But just give like an example of what it would be, would it have to be that they see someone in the common room? Or something like that…

ALAN TUDGE: Well again, there would be a reasonable suspicion test whereby the guidelines would be outlined in the Australian Border Force procedures…

QUESTION: So it wouldn't be randomly…

ALAN TUDGE: …but in the same way, this is - in the same way that this occurs on a daily basis with the Australian Border Force ocers at our borders.

QUESTION: Sure. But it is a new law - like it is fair enough to openly ask about how's it to be applied. Would it like, it wouldn't be sort of random sweep or checks just because people have their phone.

ALAN TUDGE: No. Of course not. Of course not. So I've made that very clear. You know, some of the activists will spread misinformation to say that every single person will have their mobile phone removed - that is absolutely not the case. It would be used judiciously, carefully. But when there are instances where there is reasonable suspicion that the mobile phone is being used inappropriately, if you see disgraceful images on a mobile phone, then yes, absolutely. I want that phone removed and I think all reasonable Australians do to.

QUESTION: Does inappropriate usages of the mobile phone include things like  lming the facility? Does it include anything else?

QUESTION: Contacting journalists, all that sort of thing?

ALAN TUDGE: Even if an individual has had their phone removed they will still have access to landlines, they'll still have access to computers. So there's never any question about limiting an ability of a person to be able to communicate with the outside world, including to journalists.

I mean there's a lot of public scrutiny and accountability in relation to the management of the immigration detention network. But bearing in mind, and this is sometimes poorly understood, there's about 1500 people in the immigration detention facilities today, and over 70 per cent have been evicted from the [indistinct]. So serious that they have to be in prison for 12 months or more, which then, which then enables the Minister to make that decision, and we make no apology for doing that. If you're a foreigner committing serious crime in Australia, I'm sorry, you can return to your home country. And in the meantime they're in the immigration detention network until they, until they do.

QUESTION: Do you appreciate the need for some of these people, like you mentioned 70 per cent there, that means there's 30 per cent who aren't convicted of a crime as you say. Do you appreciate the need for some of those people to have access to a phone?

ALAN TUDGE: Yeah. We have no problem with some of those individuals having access to mobile phones. We have a problem with any individual using drugs, carrying a weapon, using the phone to harass immigration detention staff which also has occurred, that's not a hypothetical. Photographs have been taken of immigration detention staff and then posted with their names, that's not acceptable.

QUESTION: I've heard that, and correct me if I'm wrong, but I've heard that this legislation also allows strip searching of people as young as 10-years-old. Is that true?

ALAN TUDGE: Look the, this legislation does not change the laws in relation to that. There are very, very strict guidelines in relation to that.

QUESTION: So that's already allowed?

ALAN TUDGE: Only in exceptional - not with people under the age of 10 - but in exceptional circumstances.

QUESTION: So ten and above?

ALAN TUDGE: There are those powers which already exist. It has to have, from memory, I think a magistrate has to authorise that for it to occur, it has to be in the presence of another person. But I can get you those precise details if you're after this.

QUESTION: There's been a live public campaign against these laws and [indistinct] 100,000 people signed some petition. Obviously, as you mentioned, there's been refugee and asylum seeker groups that have come out quite strongly against it. Has that swayed your thinking on this? Has that [indistinct]…

ALAN TUDGE: I will never be swayed from protecting innocent men, women and children in the Australian community. And I wish those people who signed that petition would also reect upon the fact that sometimes -but it's rarely - but sometimes the mobile phones are used for very, very bad purposes. And as the Minister, I'm not going to stand by and allow those phones to be used to send disgraceful child exploitation materials around to others. I will not.

QUESTION: Could I ask you about the Biloela family on Christmas Island? What's the latest? Is there any timeline for when they may be able to ever leave?

ALAN TUDGE: Well they can leave now.

QUESTION: So come back to Australia?

Last updated: 03 September 2020

ALAN TUDGE: They can return to - they can return to Sri Lanka now. I mean, most of the family have been all the way to the High Court in terms of testing whether or not they have refugee status, and they've been found they don't have that refugee status. And so they can return tomorrow.

QUESTION: So you're thinking hasn't changed on that in the last little while?

ALAN TUDGE: Well there's one individual, there's one last member of the family who I think is taking legal action to go, again, all the way to the High Court. From memory three out of the four members of the family have already done that and the High Court has found that they are not, they don't satisfy the test as being refugees. But Minister Dutton has been looking after that particular issue.

QUESTION: So just to clarify, is lming inside an immigration detention with a mobile phone, is that inappropriate use of a mobile phone?

ALAN TUDGE: If it is lming to harass a staff member, for example, then that may be under consideration. Alright.

Thanks everyone.
