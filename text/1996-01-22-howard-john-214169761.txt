HOWARD:

What would you like to ask me?

JOURNALIST: I

M r Howard, Mr Keating continues to say that you can’t be trusted and that voters  don’t believe you. What do you say to that? ;

HOWARD: 1

Well what I say is very simple. For Mr Keating to set himself up as a  judge o f  personal credibility is like Christopher Skase wanting to be the next governor o f the  Reserve Bank of Australia, j

JOURNALIST: j

Why is that though? He says that you’ve changed from definitely Conservative to a

JOURNALIST: Ã¢ÂÂ

But Mr Howard, 60% of people, more than 60% o f people don’t believe what you’ve  said about industrial relations. How are you going to turn that aroundf

HOWARD: j

HOWARD:

Paul Keating’s problem is that 1 haven’t run my election campaign to suit him.

I didn’t know the election had been held.

JOURNALIST;

But according to the opinion polls at the moment, that’s what they're saying.

HOWARD; ;

Oh yes well according to the opinion polls, 60% of the people think this  Governments time is up but that doesn’t mean to say that the Government is going to  give up and concede the election to us. !

JOURNALIST: ]

So you don't think you have a credibility problem at all? j

HOWARD; !

!

No I don’t. T don’t think.... you talk lack o f credibility across the Australian political  spectrum and good old L-A-W law Keating comes to mind more readily than anybody  else.

JOURNALIST: !

You’ve talked about changes you’d make to the unfair dismissal laxys. How would  you make them more fair? !

HOWARD:

I would ensure that the process was not dominated by the concept o f procedural  fairness and it was judged on the merits. 1 mean, if somebody on the merits has been  unfairly dismissed, that person is entitled to compensation but if somebody on th  emerits has been fairly dismissed, then the employer, often the small employer,  shouldn’t be made to suffer. The present law is totally loaded against the small  employer. The present law frightens small employers out of taking on new stafÂ£ the  present law has actually added to unemployment :

JOURNALIST: i

The Prime Minister has said again today the election might not be he)4 until May. Do  you think people can wait that long? j

HOWARD:

No they can’t. That’s selfishness o f the worst order. That’s putting personal political  interest ahead of the national interest. That;s the sort o f take it for g anted, arrogant  attitude and mindset that enables his ministers to publicly squabble over who'will  have what job. ;

JOURNALIST:

'  ÃÂ¯

Mr Howard, business people have indicated through surveys that they would like a  more simplified tax system. Can you offer that?

HOWARD:

We’ll be having quite a bit to say about business taxes during the course o f the  campaign. W e've already said that the paperwork involved in the fringe benefits tax  imposes very heavy administrative burdens on small business. We've indicated the  direction of some changes in relation to capital gains tax and when ti ie Prime Minister  finally screws up the courage to have an election, we will have moreIto say.

JOURNALIST:

Is it possible that it will be a more simplified tax system?

HOWARD:

Well I've given the answer 1 intend to give at this stage to that question. Thank you.

JOURNALIST:

Mr Howard, how important is the seat o f Ballarat and the other marginal seats to you?

HOWARD:

Well, Ballarat is important for two reasons. This will be the last qi estion. The first  reason is that you have a damn fine Member in Michael Ronaldsoii and I want him  back and I expect him to come back but it’s also a symbol of I guess political  supremacy in regional Australia and it’s a scat that was held by the 1 iberal Party for a

tong time then lost to the Labor Party and it came back again. Michael won it very  impressively in 1990, held it in ‘93 and 1 expect him to handle the present campaign  with case and to win it with an increased majority. I’ll see you later.;
