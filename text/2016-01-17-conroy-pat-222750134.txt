WASTE WATCH MEDIA RELEASE

BORDER FORCE MEDALS A STEP CLOSER TO MILITARISATION

The Australian Border Force is spending more than $1.3 million on medals in the  quest to militarise the portfolio, despite the burgeoning cost of corporate branding  within the newly created Department.

The cost of the medals is in addition to the revelation that millions of dollars have  already been spent on corporate branding, uniforms and disposal of redundant  merchandise.

Labor’s waste spokesperson, Pat Conroy, says the Government’s pursuit of a  military style within the ABF was a costly exercise.

“The problem is that not only are these medals costly, but they demonstrate the  Government’s intention to create a military style and culture within the Australian  Border Force,” Mr Conroy said.

“When you put this in the context of the Operation Fortitude fiasco we start to see a  picture emerge of the way this Department is being led.”

“We need to be asking why Peter Dutton, and Scott Morrison before him, and the  ABF Commissioner Roman Quaedvlieg are so focused on changing the image of  this Department, because ultimately it would seem this is being driven by ideology.”

“That is a dangerous prospect when you consider this is the Department deeply  involved in the Government’s response to asylum seekers, and international  relations.”
