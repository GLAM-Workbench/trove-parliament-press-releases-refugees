New Contracts for Migrant English Language Tuition

The Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, Gary Hardgrave, today announced the  awarding of two Adult Migrant English Program (AMEP) contracts that will provide English  language tuition to over 3,500 migrants and refugees in Queensland each year.

The contracts, between the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous  Affairs, TAFE Queensland Language and Literacy Services and Hilton International College  respectively, are worth more than $40 million over five years, beginning 1 July 2003.

Speaking at the contract signing ceremony, Mr Hardgrave said that the new contracts will  help thousands of migrants and refugees on their journey to successful settlement in  Australia.

'The contracts will also help maintain the AMEP's vital 'nation building' role as a facilitator of  community harmony and cohesion,' Mr Hardgrave said.

'They represent a significant investment by the Commonwealth in ensuring that new arrivals  have every opportunity to take up their entitlement to learn our national language and so  take the first and most important step towards full participation in Australian society.'

TAFE Queensland, a long-term AMEP provider, will provide both formal and informal English  tuition across Queensland, through a network of colleges from Johnstone on the far north  coast and west as far as Mount Isa.

Hilton International College will provide formal tuition in Fortitude Valley in the Brisbane  CBD.

'These contractual arrangements will enable a depth of provision which will do much to  facilitate the AMEP's reach to its very diverse client base, ensuring that AMEP clients can  access AMEP tuition wherever it is most convenient to them,' Mr Hardgrave said.
