Media Statement - 24 August 2000

The Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs, Laurie Brereton, today renewed Labor's calls for the Howard Government to cancel its human rights training program with Burma's military regime.

"The political assessment by Australia's Ambassador to Burma published by The Age newspaper today demolishes the credibility of the Howard Government's engagement with the Burmese military", Mr Brereton said.

"In a classified report sent to Canberra last month, Ambassador Trevor Wilson advised the Howard Government:

'There are clearly no grounds for optimism in the State Peace and Development Council's unchanging approach to opponents of the regime. Nor do observers in Rangoon detect any signs that the regime is willing to bend in the direction of political dialogue or any hints that meaningful movement towards transition to a freely elected government is contemplated. Rather, all the indicators point to the regime being determined to remain in power at all cost, allowing only marginal reforms in the economy and society. Neither the appointment of a new special representative by the UN Secretary-General, nor other attempts at more direct engagement with the regime have yet resulted in many substantive improvements. … Change in Burma will most likely be all too slow in coming.'"

Ã¢ÂÂÃ¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»

"Labor has repeatedly expressed strong reservations about the Howard Government's decision to conduct a human rights training program for Burmese officials in Rangoon."

"Australia is the only country to embark on such a program. Two seminars for officials selected by the Burmese Government were held in Rangoon last month. A third course is scheduled to be held in September."

"The Howard Government's misguided initiative will be warmly welcomed by Burma's military rulers as a weakening of international condemnation of their oppressive regime with its disgraceful reputation for abuse of human rights and democratic freedoms."

"Labor is committed to cancel this program. The funds involved could be more usefully spent on programs to assist Burmese refugees and the many victims of human rights abuse in Burma."

ALP National Conference - 3 August 2000

Burma

Labor reaffirms its longstanding condemnation of gross violations of human rights in Burma, including the draconian suppression of political freedoms, torture, rape, disappearances, extrajudicial killings, oppression of ethnic and religious minorities, and use of forced labour.

Labor further condemns the continued refusal of the State Peace and Development Council to accept the political verdict of the people of Burma freely expressed at the democratic elections of 1990.

Labor expresses its deep concern at the continuing repression of public political activity, the arbitrary detention, imprisonment and systematic surveillance of those in Burma seeking exercise their rights to freedom of expression, assembly and association.

Labor deplores Burma's status as the world's leading producer of opium and heroin, and reiterates its strong concern at continuing reports of complicity in this trade by elements of Burma's military regime.

Labor commends Nobel laureate and leader of the National League for Democracy, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi for her courage and determination to bring freedom and democracy to Burma. Labor acknowledges the moral and political standing of the People's Parliament formed by the National League for Democracy on 16 September 1998.

Labor calls on the State Peace and Development Council to cease its repressive attempts to suppress political freedom in Burma, and to release all political prisoners immediately and unconditionally.

Labor considers the only long-term solution to the situation in Burma is a negotiated settlement firmly based on full respect for human rights, and calls on the State Peace and Development Council to open a genuine political dialogue with Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, representatives of the National League for Democracy, and ethnic minorities.

Labor further calls on the State Peace and Development Council to fully and unconditionally cooperate with the United Nations Secretary-General's Special Representative, and to cooperate unreservedly with the international community in efforts to suppress trafficking in narcotics.

Labor expresses its strong concern about the Howard Government's decision to step up its engagement with the Burma's military regime including implementation of a human rights training course for Burmese officials. In the absence of evidence of any commitment by the State Peace and Development Council to real political reform, Labor considers this to be a misguided initiative most likely only to give international legitimacy to Burma's military rulers.

Labor calls on the Australian Government to do all that it can, including through the United Nations and regional diplomacy, to maximise international pressure on the Burmese military regime to respect human rights and democratic freedoms.

Labor in government will close the Austrade Office in Rangoon and cancel the Howard Government's human rights training program.

Given the continuing deterioration of human rights conditions in Burma, Labor supports discouraging Australian trade with Burma, discouraging Australian citizens from visiting Burma for business and

tourism, and reviewing the issue of visas for visits to Australia by Burmese officials and other persons associated with the military regime. Labor in government will also give sympathetic consideration to Burmese applying for political asylum or refugee status in Australia.
