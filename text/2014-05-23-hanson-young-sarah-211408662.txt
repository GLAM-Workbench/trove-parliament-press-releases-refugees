Fast-tracked to danger: Greens to block dangerous changes to refugee  assessment

The Abbott Government’s announcement of a fast-tracked refugee determination  system, though light on detail, is very concerning, the Australian Greens have said.

“The Abbott Government’s ideological war against refugees is putting people in danger,”  the Greens’ immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.

“Rather than moving the goal posts while playing with people’s lives, the Government  should simply lift the freeze on processing and get people the protection they need.

“Making it harder for refugees to gain protection will be the final nail in the coffin for  those families who have risked it all to find safety.

“Today’s announcement, despite being very light on detail, was a cynical attempt by the  Coalition to get their harsh Budget disaster off of the newspaper’s front pages.

“The Greens will vote to block this cruel and unnecessary move from the Abbott  Government.

“These systems aren’t there to waste people’s time, they’re there to save people’s lives.

“The Labor Party, the independents and Clive Palmer must all declare their opposition to  this unnecessary and dangerous change.”
