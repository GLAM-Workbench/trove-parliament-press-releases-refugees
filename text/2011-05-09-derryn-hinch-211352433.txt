DERRYN HINCH:

On the line now, the Leader of the Opposition Tony Abbott. Good afternoon.

TONY ABBOTT:

G’day Derryn.

DERRYN HINCH:

Talk about a free kick, because I agree with you on this. Why do you think they’ve hung so hard on this?  Nauru, the letters don’t exist in their vocabulary.

TONY ABBOTT:

Derryn, I think the Prime Minister has got to swallow her pride and pick up the phone to the President of  Nauru and I think it’s just this extraordinary stubbornness and this deep reluctance to admitting that John  Howard got anything right that stops her but surely it’s time for her to forget about her own pride and just do  what we know will work and that is reopen the centre at Nauru and you could send 1,500 or more people  across to Nauru and not get anyone back in return because there aren’t any boat people currently in detention  in Nauru.

DERRYN HINCH:

So, ok, the positive spin on this, I suppose, well we are getting rid of 800 people but then we are going to  take back 4,000. The logistics don’t make sense.

TONY ABBOTT:

No. I mean, it’s a very bad deal. I mean, just imagine if I said mate, I’ll give you $800 and you give me  $4,000 back. I mean…

DERRYN HINCH:

The other thing, of course, here too is that it smacks terribly, drawing a long bow, I know, it suddenly starts  to smack of people trading. The Prime Minister won’t deny or confirm whether children are going to be  involved in this. We say, ok, which 800 do we send and which 4,000 do we get?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, look, this is, the whole thing is riddled with uncertainty and doubt and it’s a sign of a Government  which is in full panic mode, which is increasingly desperate to deal with a situation that it knows is  completely out of control and that’s the problem - it is all of the Government’s own making. I mean, John  Howard, he copped a lot of criticism for it but he stopped the boats and this is a Government which found a  solution and has created a problem and now it’s desperate but the one thing it won’t do is reinstitute the  solution that we know worked. The other point to make is that, you know, on Friday it was Manus that was  going to save us. On Saturday it’s Malaysia that’s going to save us. What’s been completely forgotten in all  of this is East Timor that was going to save us originally and you know…

DERRYN HINCH:

Yeah, but you know and the electorate didn’t realise it, East Timor, when you watched that rabbit pulled out  of the hat just before the debate, it was never, it was never going to be on.

TONY ABBOTT:

No, look this is a Government which is literally drowning in a sea of its own deception and incompetence  and untrustworthiness and I think the public are just sick of them. I mean, the public think, you know, this  mob are just almost, they are becoming an embarrassment and all of this floundering around it just shows  that this is a Prime Minister who believes in nothing and everything depending upon the circumstances of  the moment.

DERRYN HINCH:

Well, I’m uncomfortable giving a leader of the opposition or a prime minister a free kick, I really am, but on  this issue they just keep floating them up there for people to knock them over the fence.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well Derryn, you’re right and look, as an Australian, I am embarrassed that the Government is in such  difficulty over this because in the end it’s our country which suffers and, as an Australian, I don’t want our  country to be in difficulties here but as the Opposition Leader it’s my job to hold the Government to account  and to point out the obvious which is that if only she would pick up the phone to the President of Nauru,  there’s a centre there which the Nauruans are ready, willing and able to open within weeks. It could start  taking boat people within weeks and there’s no question of taking people back.

DERRYN HINCH:

From memory, during the late days, the dying days of the election Scott Morrison went to Nauru. Am I  correct in saying that?

TONY ABBOTT:

That’s right.

DERRYN HINCH:

And then during limbo-land, as I call it, when you were both trying to negotiate to see who’s got the keys to  the Lodge, you said then, within four days of us being in office, if we can do the deal with the independents,  Nauru will be reopened.

TONY ABBOTT:

That’s correct. That’s correct because we had assurances from the President of Nauru that they were only  too anxious to reopen the centre because they were very happy with the way it worked in the past and they’d  be very happy to do it again and, as I said, the difference between Nauru and Malaysia is that Malaysia  wants to give us back five times as many as we give to them and Nauru doesn’t actually have any. So,  they’d be glad to take them and the other point I should make, Derryn, is that the reason that the Prime  Minister always gave for not sending boat people to Nauru was that it hadn’t signed the UN Convention on  Refugees.

DERRYN HINCH:

That’s true.

TONY ABBOTT:

Malaysia hasn’t signed the UN Convention…

DERRYN HINCH:

No, Malaysia hasn’t either. That’s why, I don’t know how they get out of that one. I’ll tell you, one final  point. You and John Howard and Phillip Ruddock, you must trawl through some of the comments made by  the Prime Minister and made by senior Labor people from the last couple of years about the Pacific Solution  saying, what’s the difference between our Pacific Solution and the one you’re coming up with now?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I’ve got a comment in front of me, you know? She said that detaining boat people on Pacific islands  was costly, unsustainable and wrong in principle. Well, how could it have been so wrong then and so right  on Friday when she announced Manus and, as I said, that’s why I think the public are rapidly coming to the  conclusion that this is a Prime Minister who believes in nothing and believes in everything, depending upon  the circumstances.

DERRYN HINCH:

Alright Mr Abbott, you’ve had your free commercial for once. Thanks for your time.

TONY ABBOTT:

No worries, Derryn.
