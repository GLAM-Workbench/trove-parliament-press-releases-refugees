DEBORAH KNIGHT:

We’re joined now by the Minister responsible for our own border security and  immigration, Peter Dutton. Good morning to you.

PETER DUTTON:

Good morning Deb.

DEBORAH KNIGHT:

A shocking attack in New York. The US President is saying that all countries need to  toughen up on border protection, will Australia?

PETER DUTTON:

Well it's a shocking and pointless attack. These are innocent people and really what  does this achieve?

We're very lucky in our country to have great border protection agencies. Our  intelligence and law enforcement agencies are doing more than ever, working  around the clock to keep us safe. They've foiled 14 attempts over recent years and  72 people have been charged with terrorist-related offences over the last couple of  years, but like all Western democracies, we face the ongoing scourge of terrorism.  It'll be with us for a long period of time and we need to defeat it as best we can.

DEBORAH KNIGHT:

So any review of the system as we have it?

PETER DUTTON:

No. We've obviously got strong border protection systems in place. We screen very  heavily people before they're issued visas, even before they get on planes. We've  got Airport Liaison Officers in key hubs. They're offloading passengers where we  deem them to be a security threat and there's a lot of work that's going on with the  state authorities as well as with ASIO, the AFP, the Australian Border Force - all of  them working very closely together - and that's the whole idea of this new Home  Affairs portfolio as well.

DEBORAH KNIGHT:

Well the US President is cracking down. He wants to tighten laws around Green  Cards. How much impact will that have on Aussies living, working and holidaying in  the US?

PETER DUTTON:

Well it could have a big impact, but as you'd expect, the President reflects the view  of the American people in that they want to make sure the people who are coming to  their country are the right people; that is they're people that are going to abide by the  law, adhere to American values and make sure that they don't pose a threat - and  they’re similar policy settings that we've got here.

We're lucky in the fact that we're an island nation and we have the ability to stop  people hopping on planes and it's why we've got a tough border protection policy  when it comes to boats as well.

So the Americans will do what's in their national interest; we'll do what's in ours, but  we will work very closely with the United States sharing intelligence and information  literally around the clock. We work very closely with our Five Eyes partners.

DEBORAH KNIGHT:

Alright. Now the Prime Minister is returning from Israel and he's coming back to the  chaos of the citizenship fiasco. Why won’t you just hold an audit and get this mess  sorted once and for all?

PETER DUTTON:

Well Deb, the difficulty with the audit is that there's one report that if you were of  Italian origin it could descend six generations without you even doing anything. You  could be born here, your grandparents were born here…

DEBORAH KNIGHT:

…but isn't that confusion even more reason to get it clarified?

PETER DUTTON:

Well, I think the point is that the onus is on the individual to go back through their  family trees…

DEBORAH KNIGHT:

…but the individuals aren't doing that, that's not occurring.

PETER DUTTON:

Well I think they are and I think even with the latest incident of Stephen Parry, he  was obviously waiting for the outcome of the court to decide whether or not …

DEBORAH KNIGHT:

…he sure was, he waited three months.

PETER DUTTON:

Well he was waiting for the judgement and I think obviously a lot of people were  waiting to see how the court ruled and whether or not particular people would be  captured by the legislation.

I think people know, at least to a limited degree, their backgrounds and their histories  and if they need to do some research - and this is across politics - it applies to  candidates who have run and I suspect if you go back over the last couple of  decades you'd find people - including Prime Ministers frankly - who weren't  qualified.



So there's a lot of work that needs to be done, but the onus is on the individual to  demonstrate that they're eligible, that they're in compliance with that particular  provision of the constitution.

DEBORAH KNIGHT:

Alright, well Barnaby Joyce says that other politicians will be caught up in this.  You've got a slim majority. Are you worried you'll have no one left?

PETER DUTTON:

No, we're not. As I say, I think it's difficult for some people because they're relying on  other country's laws. It's not about the Australian law as to whether or not you're an  Australian citizen. They've got an honest held belief for many people.

If you look back at some of the cases, that they were born here, their parents were  born here, their grandparents were born here and yet in some cases people are still  captured by a change in the law in Italy or in France or somewhere else.

So people have to look at their individual circumstances and I think now it will be the  case that people really dig deeper into their backgrounds and make sure that they're  complying with the Australian law.

DEBORAH KNIGHT:

Alright and just quickly on the issue of Manus Island, how do you resolve that  peacefully? We know that the asylum seekers don't want to leave and the locals  don't want them there.

PETER DUTTON:

Well, there's new facilities that have been built and it's a much better facility than  where people are at the moment and I'd just say to the advocates here who are  telling people not to move, to resist moving centres; that they're not doing those  people any favours. We've got a deal with the United States to move 1,200 people. I  want to close Manus as quickly as possible, but it doesn't help when you've got the  Greens and others who are telling people not to engage, not to move. It makes a  very difficult situation even worse.

DEBORAH KNIGHT:

Alright. Minister, thanks for your time this morning.

PETER DUTTON:

Thanks Deb.
