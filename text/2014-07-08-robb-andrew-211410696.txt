MINISTER FOR TRADE AND INVESTMENT  The Hon Andrew Robb AO MP   8 JULY 2014  ABC AM PROGRAM

INTERVIEW WITH CHRIS UHLMANN



Subjects: Japan Australia Economic Partnership Agreement

CHRIS UHLMANN:

Japan and Australia's trade relationship emerged in the shadow of the Second World War and  helped to drive the development of the resources industry here.

China is now this nation's number one trading partner, but there are hopes that the Japanese  relationship is about to be supercharged.

Fifty-seven years after his grandfather settled Japan's first trade pact with Australia, today Prime  Minister Shinzo Abe will address both houses of Parliament and sign a new trade deal.

That deal was brokered by Andrew Robb, the Trade Minister.

Welcome to AM.

ANDREW ROBB:

Good morning, Chris.

CHRIS UHLMANN:

Andrew Robb, what difference will this trade deal make to the lives of Australians?

ANDREW ROBB:

This will generate over the next 10, 20, 30 years literally hundreds of thousands of jobs - and in the  end that's what you're in government for, to give people jobs and peace of mind and security.

The opportunities that this deal will bring extend well beyond agriculture, and yet it's the best deal  Japan's ever done on agriculture or any other thing for that matter.  But it will go extensively into services, and nearly 80 per cent of our economy, our whole GDP is  services, so it's going to open up all sorts of opportunities in aged care, financial services,  environmental management services. You name it, any sort of service, that opportunity has now  been presented by this deal.



CHRIS UHLMANN:

And obviously it's difficult to do these things, but can you put a figure on it? In what way do you see  trade growing between Australia and Japan over the next few years?

ANDREW ROBB:

Well, just take one - the Meat and Livestock Organisation has done its own modelling and it showed  that, over the next 20 years, $5.5 billion, it'll increase to $5.5 billion revenue for the beef industry  alone.



Now, that's a huge increase in one market and we're going to see these sorts of agreements in sea  food, in horticulture. Horticulture is a fantastic result, right across dozens of products in horticulture.

CHRIS UHLMANN:

And more Japanese investment; you've lifted the threshold from $248 million to over $1 billion before  foreign investment rules are triggered.

ANDREW ROBB:

Indeed. Once you get to need a greater trading relationship, you get a greater investment  relationship. History shows us that.

And this billion-dollar threshold reflects the trust and the relationship, the depth of the relationship  and it will encourage, as I think we've seen from comments from senior Japanese business figures  over the last couple of days, it will encourage significant increases in investment as well.

CHRIS UHLMANN:

Now, the deal was essentially settled in April, but we have yet to see the text of it, even though it will  be signed today.

The Opposition is complaining about that. That's a reasonable thing to complain about, isn't it?

ANDREW ROBB:

Well, the thing is these things have to be worked through and legalised and the translations done.  This is the normal practice.

What normally is done is, once we have between governments, agreed on a deal, it gets signed,  then it goes, traditionally it's done, under Labor it did - I don't know what they're complaining about;  they did exactly the same thing that we're doing with any agreements that they struck.

It then goes to the Parliament; our Parliament, the Japanese parliament; it then goes through our  treaties committee; it is ample opportunity for the Labor Party, the Greens, everyone else, the public,  to review this agreement.

CHRIS UHLMANN:

Well, Japan's key interest at the moment is security, both in energy security and in its military  security - we'll come to military in just a moment.



But what about its energy security? Do you see great reason to hope that we'll see a lot more  investment there from Australia into Japan and a lot more trade there?

ANDREW ROBB:

Well, the market is suggesting, the key players are suggesting that, over the next 10 years there'll be  a need for virtually a new Gorgon, which is 15 million tonnes of gas, which is our biggest project  ever. That'll have to come onto the market each and every year, a project of that size.

So the opportunities over the next 10 years if we get our cost structure right are phenomenal, and  Japan will be looking for much greater energy and gas supplies and with the growth that they're now  starting to generate in their economy, the opportunities are tremendous with Japan - and with other  countries, for that matter.

CHRIS UHLMANN:

We are looking for new submarines; Japan has some of the best submarine technology in the world;  will there be a military agreement on technology sharing?

ANDREW ROBB:

Well we're talking to quite a range of countries on submarines. It's often the future, but of course  Japan is technologically, very, very strong. It not only will help their case with submarines in due  course. But immediately, we're going to see benefits on the electronics front and other things -  cheaper prices for Australian consumers.

CHRIS UHLMANN:

So there will be an agreement on submarines?

ANDREW ROBB:

No. What I'm saying is, it puts them in a good stead because of their strong technology position, but  we've got a long way to go yet, and we are talking to a range of countries.

CHRIS UHLMANN:

Japan and China's relationship could hardly be worse at the moment, and yet we've seen the  Government here encourage Japan in reinterpreting its pacifist constitution. Aren't you playing a  reasonably dangerous game at the moment?

ANDREW ROBB:

Not at all. Not at all. Australia is now so strongly and deeply economically tied to China, to Japan, to  Korea that our interests dictate closer security with all three countries.

Closer security. Now, that means each and every one of us needs to be in a position to have strong  security agreements between ourselves.

CHRIS UHLMANN:

The countries of Europe were deeply economically tied before the First World War and Julie Bishop  has pointed out recently that some of the tensions that we've seen in the South China Sea echo  what we saw before the First World War. You're not concerned about getting too deeply embroiled  with Japan at the moment, are you?

ANDREW ROBB:

No I'm not, because at the same time, we've been deepening our security ties with Korea and with  China. As I said, those close economic links - 51 per cent of all our exports now go to Korea, Japan  and to China. It is in our interest, our absolute interest, to have peace in the region and the best way  in our view to do that is to have strong security ties for all three countries.   CHRIS UHLMANN:

Is that the way the Chinese see it? Because the Chinese news agency Xinhua says in an editorial  that the Japanese PM is using Australia to build a network against China and that Abe's visit to  Australia will create new instability in the Asia-Pacific region.

ANDREW ROBB:

Well that's an editorial positionâ€¦

CHRIS UHLMANN:

Of a government agency.

ANDREW ROBB:

Look, the bottom line is that we have to look to our own affairs and adopt what we think is in the best  interest of Australia from the point of view of our economic position and our security position.

Our view has been, and we've been consistent with this, we are improving the security ties between  all three countries and ourselves and that has, in every respect I think, helped our economic  dealings.

We have got the Korean free trade away; we've got the Japanese one being signed today and we  are well advanced with a free trade agreement with China.

CHRIS UHLMANN:

Andrew Robb, finally, you're a senior member of this Government. Are you comfortable with  Australia handing back asylum seekers back to Sri Lanka and the secrecy surrounding the process?

ANDREW ROBB:

I am totally comfortable. If the bottom line is that over the last six years, we saw 50,000 people come  in a most disorganised, costly and disruptive... and the worst part of it was thousands of people died  at sea. There has not been one death at sea since we changed policy and stopped the boats.

CHRIS UHLMANN:

Andrew Robb, thank you.

ANDREW ROBB:



Thanks Chris.

CHRIS UHLMANN:

Andrew Robb is of course the Trade Minister.
