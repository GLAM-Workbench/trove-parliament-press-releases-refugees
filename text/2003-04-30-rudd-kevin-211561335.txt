A New Australian Social Contract



2003 Andrew Fisher Memorial Lecture

Gympie







There is, at present, pessimism about our party and our movement.   Some of  it heartfelt.  Some of it fashionable.  A lot of it fatalist.

It is, however, a pessimism I do not share.

And it is a pessimism I will not share.

My reason is simple.  I believe the Labor story is a good story.

I believe it is a good story because for more than a century is has said that to  look after myself I must also look after my fellow man.

It is a good story because we’ve have dared to proclaim that life is something  more than the absolute pursuit of self-interest - that human nature (as Adam  Smith rightly argued two centuries ago) is both self-regarding and other-regarding.

It is also a good story because when we talk about the great Australian ‘fair-go’, we are talking about something that our movement has grafted into the  Australian soul.

Let us be clear.  Fairness is a Labor value.  There was nothing about ‘fairness’  in the original convict settlement.  Nor did ‘fairness’ play any part in the belief

1

structure of the various conservative administrations that ruled the Australian  colonies prior to Federation.

Fairness has been the bone and marrow of our message to the Australian  people from the rudimentary beginnings of our movement in the great  industrial upheavals of 1891.

And when, in the decades since then, the political parties that have made up  the conservative side of politics have mouthed their concern for ‘fairness,’  they have been forced to do so because our movement has placed ‘fairness’  front and centre as a core component of the Australian political terrain.

The  ‘fair go’ is the Labor movement’s lasting legacy to the Australian political  culture.

There are, of course, many other reasons why the Labor story is a good story.

Labor is the party of Australian nationalism.  We are a party that believes that  the Australian nation has not somehow spontaneously combusted from  market forces. Rather, it is a nation built by the blood, sweat and tears of the  Australian people through the deliberate agency and action of government.

But just as we are the party of Australian nationalism, so too are we a party  that by its essential nature is proudly internationalist by instinct, by  conviction and by tradition - a party that by its nature cannot be indifferent to  injustice wherever it occurs.

These, therefore, are the reasons why the Labor story is a good story.

It is a story that speaks to the good angels in our human nature, not just the  bad.

It is a story that speaks to hope rather than a story that speaks to fear - for the  exploitation of fear has always been the preferred terrain of our political  opponents.

Most importantly, it is a story that for a century has spoken of the practical  things that government can do to improve the lives of working families.

It is because the Labor story is a good story that we always bounce back.

And that is why we will bounce back again.

And will do so well before the pessimists believe we can.

Defining the Labor Narrative

Of course, having a good story to tell does not of itself deliver government.   That is the practical, the often bloody, business of politics.

But politics without a Labor story; politics without a Labor narrative; politics  without a clearly articulated Labor vision - is politics purely of the machine  and, therefore, is politics without purpose.

The political challenge for our party therefore is as it has been for the last  century:

ÃÂ¦ to take Labor’s constant values;  ÃÂ¦ to apply them to Australia’s current circumstances, and in doing so  ÃÂ¦ to craft a vision for Australia’s future;

Of course, our challenge does not stop there. We must define the fundamental  differences between our vision for Australia and that of our opponents.

And we must win the battle for ideas, the battle for hearts and minds, and  win what Neville Wran has rightly called the ‘blood and shit’ of electoral  politics in order to deliver our program through government.

So what is Labor’s vision splendid?

For more than a century Labor has argued for an Australian social contract:

z  a contract between government and the people;

z  a contract that recognises the enormous economic benefit that is

delivered by market capitalism, but a contract that recognises that  human beings are not economic commodities;    z  a contract that recognises that markets depend on public goods like

education, a contract that recognises that markets depend also on  robust public institutions to regulate them;  z  a contract that recognises that sometimes market simply fail; and

z  most fundamentally, a contract that recognises that the purpose of

markets is to serve human beings rather than the purpose of human  beings being to serve markets.

I argue that given the current national circumstances in which we find  ourselves, Labor must argue for a new Australian social contract that contains  three fundamental propositions.

ÃÂ¦ a contract in which we guarantee security for the nation;  ÃÂ¦ a contract in which we guarantee opportunity for all; and

3

ÃÂ¦ a contract in which we guarantee compassion, protection and care for  the weak and the vulnerable.

These must be the core components of the Australian Labor narrative. The  Australian Labor story.  The Australian Labor vision.





Security for the nation

Labor’s first guarantee must be the security of the nation.

On this, Labor has a proud history.  It was Andrew Fisher, whose memory  and whose legacy we honour here this evening, who argued for an  indigenous Australian defence force.

In an address to more than 2000 people in Gympie’s Olympic Theatre in 1909,  Andrew Fisher, Member for Wide Bay, Leader of the Parliamentary Labor  Party and Australian Prime Minister argued for the approaching election that:

“…we hold out a reasonable hope to you that if the people respond to our call  to them [in this election] to provide for an effective Australian defence of its  own, we expect to find a means to carry it out in three year’s time.”

It was this policy speech delivered in this city and the campaign that followed  that saw Fisher’s re-election - for the first time as a majority Australian Labor  Government (with a majority of both the House and the Senate) which then  set about implementing Labor’s program.

Fisher argued for an indigenous Australian navy.  The conservatives argued  that this was disloyal and that the better way was to simply send money to  the Royal Navy to purchase an additional Dreadnaught for the Imperial Fleet.

Fisher argued that the Australian navy should be built in Australia. The  conservatives argued that it should be built in British shipyards.

Fisher argued for compulsory military training to build the backbone of an  Australian army - projecting in his Gympie policy speech that by 1915, 99,000  able men would have been trained (interestingly, nearly double the size of the  current Australian defence force).

Fisher’s speech is a remarkable speech in the context of the times because he  argued, consistent with the tradition of Labor nationalism, that this country  would ultimately be responsible for its own national security because if push  came to shove, we could not rely on anybody else to defend our country for  us.

John Curtin inherited this tradition. When Curtin inherited the prime  ministership in 1941, after a decade of conservative government, he inherited  a moribund defence force that once again had to be built up from scratch.  The  army was microscopic.  The navy antiquated. And the airforce virtually non-existent. This was how the conservatives had gone about preparing for  Australia’s national security in the 1930s.  Their recipe for Australia’s national  security rested exclusively on British assurances over the impregnability of  Singapore.  It was Curtin who had to deal with the wreckage that followed.

It was Curtin who turned to America, without pang or regret, in Australia’s  darkest hour.  Had Menzies remained as Prime Minister, there is no evidence  that he would have done so.

It was Curtin and Labor that formed our alliance with the United States in  1941.  Although the conservatives formalised this alliance with the ANZUS  treaty in 1951, the alliance was a central component of Labor national security  policy from the start.

And so it remains today.  The US alliance remains the central pillar of Labor  national security policy.  However, our fundamental difference with the  conservatives is that for us it is not the only pillar of our national security  policy.

For Labor, our national security rests on three basic components:

z  our alliance with the United States;

z  our membership of the United Nations; and

z  our policy of comprehensive engagement with Asia.



Just as the US alliance was a Labor creation under Prime Minister Curtin, so  too was Australia’s engagement of the United Nations the creation of Labor  Foreign Minister Evatt.

Evatt did not just sign Australia up to the UN.  Evatt, in the great tradition of  Australian political activism, had himself conscripted to the drafting  committee that constructed the UN charter and the system of collective  security that it embodies under the UN Security Council.

Evatt sought to recognise the role of the great powers in international security  by according them permanent member status of the UN Security Council. But  he sought to counterbalance their powers by constructing a Council which  also contained ten non-permanent members whose majority support was also  necessary for the international community to act against another state.

And for good measure, although little known in this country, it was an  Australian who chaired the first meeting of the UN Security Council

5



Australia’s, and Australian Labor’s, influence over the structure, powers, and  procedures of the United Nations Organisation was profound.  And it  remained that way for the following half century - from Evatt through Evans.

Which is why Australia has enjoyed such a good international name - a  contributor state to the problems confronting the international order - rather  than the “problem” state that it has since become in the eyes of the world.

The third pillar of Australian national security policy is our policy of  comprehensive engagement in Asia.  Once again, this is part and parcel of  Labor’s foreign policy heritage.  Begun by Whitlam.  Prosecuted by Hawke.  And delivered by Keating.

It rests on the simple proposition that if you have good relations with your  neighbours it is good for your security. And if you have bad relations with  your neighbours it is bad for security.  There is an economic dimension as  well.  If you have good relations with your neighbours it is good for the  economy, exports and jobs.  But if you bad relations with your neighbours, it  is bad for the economy, exports and jobs.

So profound are these strategic truths that they appear to have escaped the  comprehension of the Howard Government these last seven years.

For Labor, our argument is that a balanced security policy for Australia must  rest on these fundamental pillars: The alliance, the UN and the region.

Most of the time, these pillars will reinforce one another. Sometimes,  inevitably, they will rub up against one another, as has occurred most recently  on Iraq.

But we believe that given the breadth and depth of the threat spectrum facing  Australia in the decades ahead, our approach represents the only responsible  course of action for this nation.

The question the Australian people are asking themselves is are we more  secure or less secure than we were seven years ago?

Are we more secure of less secure in Asia than we were seven year ago?

Do we have more enemies or less enemies in Asia than we did seven years  ago?

Do we have more friends or less friends in Asia than we did seven years ago?

6

And as a result of Mr Howard’s policy on Iraq, are we more of a target or less  of a target for Islamic terrorist organisations in South-East Asia than we  would otherwise have been?

These are cold, hard, rational questions that Mr Howard has always refused  to answer.

Mr Howard’s solution to all this nation’s national security challenges has been  the US alliance.  His operating assumption is that the US represents the  answer to the range of national security threats that this nation faces now and  in the decades ahead.

Mr Howard is a poor student of history.  He forgets Menzies’ failure to  persuade the Kennedy Administration to back Australia against Indonesia in  the 1960s.

He forgets Richard Nixon’s Guam Doctrine of 1968 which said that the allies  of the United States were responsible for their own security within their own  regions and the responsibility of the United States was to intervene if their  allies’ security was threatened by great powers beyond their region.  In other  words, neighbourhood disputes were to be sorted out by the neighbours  themselves.

And remarkably, Mr Howard forgets his own experience with the Clinton  Administration when his plaintive cry for American ‘boots on the ground’ in  Timor was left unheeded.

So while day by day, year by year, the Howard Government goes about  shredding our bilateral relationships across the region, he has no capacity to  claim that future American administrations will be more minded to resolve  Australia’s regional security dilemmas on our behalf than they have been in  the past.

Nor should that be the responsibility of America. It is, after all, the region that  we have been assigned by our history and our geography and in which we  need to craft our own future against that day when America, for reasons of its  own, may choose to withdraw from the region altogether.

Labor also argues that if the nation is to address the range of security threats  that it now confronts, it must do so through an integrated national security  response.  In the past, Australia has never had an integrated national security  policy. We have had a foreign policy. We have had a defence policy. We have  had an international trade and investment policy.  We have had a miscellany  of policing responsibilities shared by Customs, the Australian Federal Police  and other agencies.

7

But against these divided and largely uncoordinated responsibilities,  Australia faces a threat spectrum characterised by increasing complexity and  inter-connectedness.

We must always be vigilant against the possibility, however remote, of  incursions against our territorial integrity by other states.

But in the post-September 11/post-Bali world we must be equally vigilant  against other non-state actors - principally terrorists.

Then there are the challenges presented by people smugglers, by international  money laundering, and by the international narcotics trade.  And by the  proliferation of small arms in vulnerable, failing and/or failed states.

These problems are rife in own immediate regions - the South-West Pacific  and South East Asia.

These require an integrated response which is why Labor proposes the  establishment of an Office of National Security - located in the Prime  Minister’s portfolio, responsible for the coordination of an integrated national  security policy aimed at responding to the totality of our threat spectrum, not  just part of it.  And most importantly, an agency responsible for providing  advice to Government on a rational allocation of budgetary resources across  the competing national security policy priorities that our country faces.





Opportunity for All

A new Australian social contract must first and foremost guarantee not only  security for the country. It must also guarantee opportunity for all.

Labor must be the party of opportunity.  Opportunity for all, not just for  some.  Opportunity for the many, not just the few.

We must provide Australians with the maximum opportunities to make the  most of their human potential.  Not only is this important in leading fulfilling  human lives, it is also important for the nation in harnessing our collective  human capital in the construction of a strong economy.

Labor has a proud economic record.  The internationalisation of the  Australian economy during the Hawke and Keating periods is the principal  reason the Australian economy has generated strong economic growth over  the last decade; and for the first time in the last century, generated per capita  growth in GDP beyond the OECD average.

8



The Hawke/Keating reforms on exchange rates, interest rates, the financial  sector, the labour market, and in national competition policy created a  productivity surge in the Australian economy in the 1990s that continues to  fuel our growth today.

Let us be absolutely clear about this.  The hard yards were done by Labor.  All  the Liberal Government has done has been to sit on its hands, reap the  rewards and pretend that a $32 billion consumption tax somehow equals  reform.

They know and we know that it doesn’t.

They know and we know that Labor reengineered the national economy over  thirteen years following seven years Liberal Party indolence under Prime  Minister Fraser and Treasurer John Howard.  The key question is what is the  current government, in its seventh year of office, now doing to enhance  productivity for the future?

Unfortunately the answer is very little.  We do not have an effective  innovation policy on behalf of the government.  While there will be some  improvement to the performance of firms through the continuation of the ICT  revolution, this will at best be episodic and will not be the product of an  integrated strategy on the part of government.

A remaining area for productivity enhancement lies in education and  training. But once again, we see a government sitting on its hands rather than  seizing the opportunity.  The government’s message to the education and  training sector has been simple: do more with less. No leadership. No vision.  And no money.

While reforms to this sector are needed, the crisis in under-investment in our  higher-eduction sector and research institutions in particular cannot be  underestimated.

The engine room for this nation’s long-term productivity and growth is  human capital.  And for this we need not simply the reform of the education  sector. We need a revolution.



The international competitiveness of our universities today is trading on the  dwindling dividends of investments made long ago during the Menzies,  Whitlam and Hawke/Keating periods.

The Governor of the Reserve Bank, Ian MacFarlane, reminded us last year that  Australia no longer has a university ranking in the world’s top 100, that

9

although Australia may have progressed in the breadth of its education, “the  same is untrue about the depth”.

The operating costs of our universities today are massively cross-subsidised  by the payments of foreign students.

But what the Government fails to realise is that the goose that has laid this  particular golden egg has just about been cooked.   Whereas our universities  today can still just manage to offer a quality education at reasonable cost for  foreign students, our failure to reinvest in these universities (and their  declining reputation relative to other regional and international universities)  means that their relative attractiveness to foreign students will also decline  over the course of the next decade.   This is one of the many short-sighted  approaches of the current government.

Our education, training and research sectors are critical for future  productivity enhancements to our economy. They are therefore critical as  future drivers of economic growth.

They are critical for future employment.

And beyond these measurable things, they are critical to the public culture of  this nation - as a nation in which ideas and an intellectual tradition are  celebrated, not denigrated.

Most fundamentally, education is the engine room of opportunity. Of equality  of opportunity. Of fairness. Of the heart and soul of the Labor narrative.  For  Labor, equality of opportunity in education, in our schools, in our training  institutions and in our universities, is non-negotiable.

It is a line which we cannot allow this government to cross.

For what this government has embarked upon is the incremental destruction  of the Whitlam revolution in higher education. The hallmark of that  revolution was that any child of ability had the right to a higher education  irrespective of their parents’ means.

As the child of a poor family, that is how I got to university.

Which is why the restoration of Whitlam’s vision (albeit in a different form)  must be front and centre in Labor’s vision for our nation’s future.





Compassion

10

A new Australian social contract must first guarantee security for the nation;  second, it must guarantee opportunity for all; and third, it must guarantee  compassion, protection and care for the weak and the vulnerable.

Compassion is a word we hear little in the public debate of this country.

It is a word that we need to hear much, much more.

Compassion, protection and care for the weak and vulnerable, both within the  country and beyond, are fundamental to the Labor narrative.

Just as they are alien to the Howard Government’s narrative.  They are in fact  alien to the entire conservative political vocabulary.  The closest the  conservatives come to compassion is an occasional sense of personal  responsibility and noblesse oblige.  In other words, compassion is seen by the  conservatives as a discretionary private act - as opposed to the mandatory  responsibility of society through government.

And therein lies the yawning chasm between us.  Labor and the conservatives  offer different definitions of security.  We offer different understandings of  opportunity, in particular the question of opportunity for all.  But when it  comes to compassion there is no common ground between us.

How is this chasm reflected in policy?

We support Medicare.  They destroy Medicare.

We built Medibank in 1973.  They destroyed it in 1976.

We built Medicare in 1983.   They said they’d destroy it in 1987.  They said  they destroy it in 1993.  In 1996 they said they’d keep it “lock stock and  barrel” in order to get themselves elected.  And now the demolition derby is  on again.

It’s a bit like the conservative definition of fairness.  They use the word.  They  repudiate its substance.

The same with Medicare.  They use the word.  But their use of the word is  done specifically to camouflage the destruction of its substance.

Medicare, for this government, will become a hollow shell.

And the reason for that is that they have never believed in it.  They have  never believed in a compassionate health care system which provides  universal access to high quality health care for all, not just for some.

11

They’ve always believed in an Americanised health system.  For thirty years  they’ve tried to create one. And right now they are on the verge of doing so.

One low quality health system for the poor.  One high quality health system  for the rich.   And what does this say about the great Australian ‘fair-go’ for  all?

We see the same absence of compassion in the under-provision of nursing  home beds for the frail aged.  We see the same absence of compassion in the  under-provision for disability services.

There is also an absence of compassion for asylum seekers - arguably the  most vulnerable of all.

And there is the same absence of compassion for working families under  financial pressure.

Compassion is a foreign language to the Howard Government.

But in Labor’s vision for Australia, compassion must be a central part of our  narrative.   If Labor fails to advance this cause, let me assure you there is no  other political party in Australian politics that will take it up.

It is ours and ours alone.





Conclusion

These then are the fundamental ingredients of Labor’s story; Labor’s  narrative; and Labor’s vision for our nation’s future.

They are, however, by no means the final ingredients of the Labor story.   While are values remain constant, the political terrain in which we seek to  advance these values is forever changing.

In the context of contemporary Australia, the Australian people will also want  to know what direction we will be offering the nation on:  z  corporate regulation (liberal capitalists believing they have won the

ideological debate must now confront the demands of shareholders,  employees and consumers to be better protected from corporate abuse)  z  aging and retirement;

z  immigration and population;

z  sustainability (now a Labor value in its own right)



12

These are being addressed by our shadow ministry and they too will form  part of Labor’s vision for Australia’s future - but a vision still driven by  fundamental Labor values of security, fairness and compassion.

We will offer a different vision for Australia to that of our political opponents.

John Howard has dedicated his entire political career to the reconstruction of  the nation in his own image.

John Howard leads the most radical, right wing government in the history of  the Australian Federation.

But the radical dimensions of this agenda are masked by the dullness of the  man, the ‘everyman’ qualities which he seeks to exude, and by constructing a  political persona that purports to be reasonable, non-threatening and as non-inspiring as your average suburban bank manager.

The key to the politics of John Howard is that he never declares the political  agenda he is prosecuting until after he has executed it.

His standard stock in trade is dissimulation.

He is a master of the half-truth.

He is, as a consequence, a master of deception.

We saw this with his Voltairean embrace of Hansonism.  We saw it in the  political manipulation of Tampa.  We’ve seen it with Children Overboard.  We’ve seen it with his dissimulation on Australia’s pre and post-war  commitments and legal responsibilities in the war against Iraq.  And on the  domestic agenda, we see it now with Medicare.

John Howard: never declaring directly what he is actually doing; always  pretending he is in fact not doing what he is actually doing; and once it is  done, laughing quietly to himself that again the Australian people have been  deceived.

This is the standard operating procedure of the Howard political machine.  Some admire it for is purported political skill craft.  I despise it.  Because apart  from anything else, it represents the absolute prostitution of truth.

Howard’s apologists describe him as a conviction politician.  For a conviction  politician, he is remarkably coy about the substantive enterprise in which he  is engaged.

13

14

And what is the nature of that enterprise?  What is the nature of the John  Howard narrative - the real one, not the confected one?

John Howard’s mission is a fundamental redistribution of power in this  country - political, economic, and cultural power - from the weak to the  strong.  From working Australians to the wealthiest Australians.

In doing so, John Howard is fracturing whatever social contract remained  between government and the governed.

Our responsibility as a political movement and a political party is to unmask  Howard’s vision for his new Australia, and expose it for the ideological  extremism that it represents.

Our responsibility is to argue an alternative vision based on our values of  security, opportunity and compassion.

Our responsibility then is to join the battle.

This is the project to which our leadership and our Parliamentary Party is  committed.

And this is the project through which we propose to win.
