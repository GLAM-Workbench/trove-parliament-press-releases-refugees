Swan reveals another budget blowout on boats

24/09/12

Labor’s end of year financial results for 2011/12 have revealed further budget blowouts in  immigration of $265 million, since May of this year, highlighting again the significant cost to  taxpayers of Labor’s failure on our borders, Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Scott  Morrison said today.

“We already know that last financial year 112 boats illegally entered Australia carrying 8,311 people.  This was a record result for illegal boat arrivals in a financial year and 47% more than what was  estimated by the Government, when they revised their budget after the failure of their Malaysian  people swap,” Mr Morrison said.

“The release of today’s final budget outcome shows that in 2011/12 Labor set another record on  costs for managing asylum seekers, by spending $1.38 billion on their failed asylum seeker policies,  including $208 million of the $265 million blowout on immigration revealed in today’s figures.

“The final year result for 2011/12 equates to more than $165,000 per arrival and came in the same  year where there was a record number of people in our immigration detention network.

“The 2011/12 result is 30% or $320 million more than was originally budgeted for and 57%, or half a  billion dollars, more than what the Government spent in 2010/11.

“However of greatest concern is the fact that since Labor abolished the proven border protection  policies of the Coalition, Australia’s annual asylum budget has increased by more than 15 times over  the $85 million spent annually by the Howard Government on asylum seekers coming by boat, when  they left office.

“The running budget blowout on border failures since 2009/10 is now officially more than $4.9  billion, not including the additional costs of recent policy announcements, including the $1.3 billion  to increase our refugee and humanitarian intake to 20,000 per year at a cost of more than $50,000  per additional place.

“Cost, chaos and tragedy is the legacy of Labor’s failed border protection polices, and as the costs  continue to mount, Labor continues their refusal to restore the full suite of measures that worked  and they abolished, preferring their half hearted solution of just Nauru.

“This financial year is also proving to be another budget disaster, with boats arriving at their highest  ever rate of more than one per day on average. So far in 2012/13, more people have illegally  entered Australia by boat in less than 3 months than the Government estimated for the entire  financial year.

“In 2012/13 Labor estimated there would be 5,400 arrivals on boats illegally entering Australia. So  far this financial year 5,470 people have turned up on 87 boats in just 86 days,” Mr Morrison said.
