HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE TO MYANMAR



Today I announce the Australian Government will provide a package of support to  Myanmar as it responds to the flooding and landslides following Cyclone Komen and  heavy monsoonal rains.

This support responds to a request from the Government of Myanmar.  Australia will  provide $2 million toward the relief efforts.  We are working with the Myanmar  Government and humanitarian partners to determine how funding will be allocated.

Existing Australian funding to development and humanitarian partners in Myanmar is  also being used to support the relief efforts.  Australia is a key donor to the UN’s  Emergency Response Fund for Burma and the Central Emergency Response Fund,  both of which are releasing funds to support the response.

Prior to the cyclone, the Australian Government had deployed Australian Civilian  Corps specialists to work with humanitarian partners. A specialist is now assisting with  the relief effort and coordinating damage assessments.

The Rakhine state is one of the areas worst affected by the floods. A dedicated  specialist is working with UNHCR and the Myanmar Government to assist the 140,000  Rohinga people displaced by conflict and affected by floods.

An additional humanitarian adviser will depart for Myanmar next week to help  coordinate Australian assistance.
