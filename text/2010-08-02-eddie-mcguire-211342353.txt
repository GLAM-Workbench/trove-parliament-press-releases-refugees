E & O E - PROOF ONLY



Subjects:      Jim Stynes’ Reach Foundation; Election Campaign.



MCGUIRE: Good morning Julia.



PM: Good morning Eddie.



MCGUIRE: Hey, congratulations.  Big day at the Bulldogs yesterday.  They did the right thing for you.



PM: It was a big day out.



MCGUIRE: Also, great news with the Government supporting  Jim Stynes’ Reach Project, which has been

really supported by the community all the way through and now some government funding in an area that

really needs it as well.



PM: I think it is terrific news.  I mean, we all know Jim is a fantastic human being and he’s put so much of

his energy into his Reach Foundation, which is about training and supporting the next generation of

young leaders.  I met some amazing young people with Jim yesterday who, you know, out of Frankston

High and now studying at Oxford University and building schools in third world countries and just taking

these amazing leadership roles.  And that’s what Reach has done for them.  So we want the Reach

Foundation to be able to support more young people and Jim was particularly keen to take the Reach

Foundation out to indigenous young people, so the $4 million is going to enable that to happen.



MCGUIRE: It’s just a brilliant announcement, Julia.  Well done to you on that front.  Great to see you in the

Bulldogs scarf, by the way.  Can I just say we’re going to hear more about the real Julia.  Up until now

we’ve just had the pretend version.  What’s the real version of Julia Gillard going to be like?



PM: Well, look.  The way in which election campaigns happen is that there’s an orthodoxy about how you

manage them and how you stage manage them, so in that orthodoxy I think people have got glimpses of

me.  Now I’m going to take control of this campaign and make sure that I’m well and truly out there,

fighting every day of the election campaign and fighting for what I think is going to make the biggest

difference for this country.  Getting people in jobs, keeping people in jobs, decent working conditions,

great schools, which obviously is close to my heart - supporting young Australians.  So that’s what I’m

going to be about.  I’ve compared it on TV this morning to the difference between the coach yelling you

to lock the game down and do some safe passing of the ball and keep possession, as opposed to going

for broke to win the game.  So I’m going for broke.



MCGUIRE: Well Julia, we’ve been talking on this program for a while.  People want to be inspired at the

moment.  MasterChef is a show that’s been dominating because it inspires people because they see

people with a real passion, as opposed to maybe Big Brother, which was just a bunch of clowns all sitting

around and quacking on.  Now that was great in its day but now people want to be inspired because

we’ve all had to lock down in recent years.  Julia, we’ve seen you sort of be counter-intuitive on the

refugee situation, we’ve seen Tony Abbott saying nothing - he’s not going to be involved with

WorkChoices.  They just seem to be everyone gravitating toward the middle and not talking about what

they really believe.  So can you give us a bit of an insight into what we’re going to hear from you in the

next couple of weeks about your vision for Australia for the next ten years?



PM: Yes, thanks for that.  And I can certainly tell you the things I’ve believed in all of my life.  I believe in

the benefits of work.  I think if people can’t get a job, then that’s about not having an income but that’s

also about loss of self worth.  And we see what happens when people are on welfare and locked out of

our workforce.  So there’s nothing more important to me than a strong economy that gives people the

benefits of work.  So that’s top of my tip sheet.  Then secondly, my life has been transformed, absolutely

transformed, by having access to a good education.  If I compare my life with my father’s life, the

difference is I got to go to great schools, he got punted out of school at 14.  So central to everything I do

will be giving kids that great education.  And I just think there are a lot of times when Australians are told

to be afraid of the future; to think that the best days of this country are behind it.  I fundamentally

disagree with that.  We’ve got some big challenges in front of us.  Climate change is one of them, but

we’re up for it.  There’s nothing we can’t do if we work together, and so I’m going to be talking to people

about fronting up to those big challenges.



MCGUIRE: Julia, how do you inspire people who are small businesses and other businesses to be able to

thrive on this economy so we can employ these young kids coming through because it’s ok having the

education system, but we need to make sure we continue to grow our businesses.  And not through

government but primarily through private enterprise.



PM: I think that’s right.  And what we want to do is lift a bit of burden off the shoulders of the hard

working, often long suffering, business people who do the right thing and give others a job.  That’s why

we’re going to be cutting company tax, we’re going to cut it for small business first.  And we’re going to

be giving businesses tax write-offs.  Not all small businesses are companies.  But small businesses can

look forward to special tax write-offs, so if you need to buy that new equipment for the kitchen in your

restaurant, or that new equipment for your toolbox because you’re out there building houses or

whatever, then we’re going to be working with you to give you more support to get that done.



MCGUIRE: Is that similar to -



PM: We’ll do that for small business then they can get on with the job of giving other people jobs.



MCGUIRE: Julia, is that similar to what you brought in as a stimulus package for infrastructure, where you

gave the tax deductions for people to go and buy infrastructure for their small businesses?



PM: Yes, it’s a bit the same.  We want to make sure that if you’re investing in the capital of your business

then the tax system is working with you and helping you.  And Eddie, you’ve just mentioned stimulus.

Look, I’ve been right around this country talking to people about how they felt when the Global Financial

Crisis hit.  You know, I’ve met with people like a builder in Western Australia who said to me he’d sent his

blokes redundancy notices and he was able to rescind those redundancy notices because we provided

stimulus, kept the economy turning around.  That was the better economic plan then.  We’ve got the

better economic plan for the future.  It’s at the absolute core of this election campaign - people in work.

Whereas Mr Abbott and his friends would have had people out of work because they wouldn’t have

provided economic stimulus.  And then investing for the future - I want to put company tax down, he’s

going to put it up.  I want to get people the infrastructure they need for how business is going to be done

in the future, and that’s the National Broadband Network.



BUCHAN: Julia, last week on the Hot Breakfast we took objection to, or I in particular took objection to

some of the ways you were being covered during this election campaign.  In particular, the references to

you choosing to live in what I guess is considered a non-traditional family.  Are you getting sick of this?  I

actually felt like I was passionately defending your right to just be covered for the policies and your

personal qualifications in the top job.  But we actually had a caller come through to the Hot Breakfast and

have this reaction to what I was saying;



CUTS TO RECORDING: The problem is chicks in power mate.  It’s  never going to happen and it never

should happen.



BUCHAN: So do you feel like you’re up against that?



MCGUIRE: That was Bob from Straswell.  We can provide you with his tax file number as well, Julia.  Pass

that on to Wayne Swan.  But we were avalanched with calls with people supporting you, I must admit.



PM: Oh look, I think we’re a great country and I think in this great country people want to see everybody

get judged on their merits and their abilities, and that’s the Australian way of doing things.  To just take

someone as they come and judge them on what they do, rather than judge them on a set of assumptions

about what they might be like.  All I’m saying about my own life is look, I’ve made my own life choices,

I’m a woman in my late forties.  I’ll be celebrating my 50th birthday next year.  I’ve made my own life

choices.  I don’t ask anybody to make the same choices I made.  Everybody should make their own.



BUCHAN: And for that I think you are a fantastic example.



PM: Thank you very much.



MCGUIRE: Written and authorised by Mieke Buchan!  Julia, thanks very much for spending some time with

us this morning.  We look forward to seeing the real Julia Gillard out on the hustings and inspiring the

nation.  Don’t get caught up in all that negative stuff.  Give us something to hang our hat on and people

will follow in behind.  We need a plan, that’s what we want.  People love a plan.  Good on you, Julia.



PM: They do.  Thanks Eddie.
