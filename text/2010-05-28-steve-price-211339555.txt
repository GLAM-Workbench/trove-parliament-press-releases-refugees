E&OE

STEVE PRICE:

Tony Abbott, the Opposition Leader is on the line. Good to talk to you again.

TONY ABBOTT:

G’day, how are you?

STEVE PRICE:

I’m well. Nauru’s still there presumably as a facility. What’s the difficulty in just  saying we’ll reopen it?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, Steve, you’ve got to do that kind of thing on a government-to-government basis  and oppositions can’t negotiate with governments, but upon taking office if Christmas  Island is still full and if the boats are still coming, as I imagine they will, given the

current government’s failures, we’ll open discussions with suitable foreign countries  and if those discussions can come to a successful conclusion, and I have no reason  why they wouldn’t, we will have off shore processing facilities in other countries and  this maintains the principle of off shore processing which is a very important part of  beating the people smugglers.

STEVE PRICE:

So in your view getting the message out that if you arrive on our doorstep and you  can’t set foot on the mainland, in your view, that is the big deterrent that stopped  boats coming when it was introduced by your former government, is it?

TONY ABBOTT:

It’s not the only deterrent but it is an important part of an overall deterrence and  certainly once the boat people were being dealt with in Nauru or in Manus in PNG,  that sent a very powerful message to the people smugglers that they don’t have a  product to sell and you’ve got to deny them a product and at the moment, thanks to  the Rudd Government’s changes, the people smugglers do have a product - the great

prize of permanent residency in Australia. If the people smugglers can get you here,  that’s nearly always what you get.

STEVE PRICE:

But in many cases it was a massive waste of money, I mean, if we use the Tampa as  an example, most of those people on the Tampa who ended up in Nauru are now  either living in Auckland, Sydney or Melbourne, aren’t they?

TONY ABBOTT:

But the flow of boats stopped, Steve. Now, you talk about waste of money, sure, it  was expensive to stop the flow of boats but that was what we needed to do. Now the  boats have started again and that’s hideously expensive. I mean, the Rudd

Government has budgeted at least an extra $1 billion it seems in this Budget to deal  with the flow of boat people and every arrival costs on average $82,000 to process  and that’s before the person comes to Australia, so…

STEVE PRICE:

And you would reintroduce temporary visas?

TONY ABBOTT:

We certainly would.

STEVE PRICE:

How would they work?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, if someone was found to be a refugee, that person would get a temporary visa of  between six months and three years. If at the end of that time it was possible for the  person to go back to his or her country of origin, that would happen. If not, the person  might be given permanent residency or might be given an extension of the temporary  protection visa.

STEVE PRICE:

You have three well-known critics who are critics of this policy when you were in  government - Russell Broadbent, Judith Troeth and Petro Georgiou. You obviously  made this announcement knowing they weren’t happy. There seems to be some  debate about whether this went through the Party Room. Did it?

TONY ABBOTT:

We’ve discussed this issue week in, week out in the Party Room and it’s  overwhelming the support in the Party Room for the policy announced yesterday.  Now, I had a…

STEVE PRICE:

So how does that work? Do you have a show of hands?

TONY ABBOTT:

No, no, look, the thing is that the Party Room…

STEVE PRICE:

I gather you’re laughing because that would mean you were in there for three weeks?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, by tradition we don’t have votes. It’s very unusual for us to have a vote in the  Party Room. I did have a vote in the Party Room on the issue of the emissions trading  scheme immediately after becoming leader. But the truth is, Steve, that we have  discussed this matter up hill and down dale in the Party Room. The Rudd  Government’s failures are raised in the Party Room every week. There’s  overwhelming Party Room support for this. I accept that there’s a couple of people in

the Party Room who didn’t like the policy under the former government, they still  don’t much like the policy, but we’ve got to understand that there is no easy way to  stop the boats but if you do want to stop them, there are solutions. The former  government put those solutions into practise and if you want to stop the boats you’ve  got to change the government and let…

STEVE PRICE:

So when we throw that open to talkback callers in the next half hour, you’d think that  you would get electoral support for that move?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, in the end, it’s a question of doing what’s right and I think it is right for  Australia as a sovereign independent country that we don’t have people thinking that  we’re a soft touch, that we don’t have people thinking that people smugglers control

our immigration policy and the problem is that we have subcontracted out a part of  our immigration policy to the people smugglers under the Rudd Government.

STEVE PRICE:

Good to talk to you. Next time you’re in Melbourne come in and take some calls, I’d  like to see you.

TONY ABBOTT:

Thanks so much, Steve.
