TRANSCRIPT  16 August 2012  Interview with Kieran Gilbert  Sky News



Topic: Asylum Seekers

KIERAN GILBERT:       Minister thanks for your time.  People smugglers are  whisking more people - asylum seekers onto boats,  charging them more.  Was a rush like this expected?

JASON CLARE:             I'm not surprised.  You would expect people smugglers  to try and squeeze every last dollar out of this.

Remember Kieran that a people smuggler can

potentially make a million dollars for every boat that they  set to sea.  So you would expect them to push as many  people onto boats as they can.

My message to people that are thinking about getting

onto a boat is don't pay them a cent.  Because whilst  people smugglers might be telling you that they're selling  you a ticket to Australia that's now all changed.

KIERAN GILBERT:       Are they trying to test the government's resolve?  Test the  policy here.  Is that what they're doing?  Or are they just  trying to get in before the shutters go up?

JASON CLARE:             They're trying to make money.  That's what this has  always been about.  About making as much money as  you possibly can and whether people die or not is really  not a concern for them.  So you would expect them to try  and get as many people onto a boat as they can.

But the economic dynamics of this have now changed and  people should know that if you're trying to buy a ticket to

Australia then you may not end up in Australia.  You might  very well be buying a ticket to Nauru.

KIERAN GILBERT:       And one of the vessels was picked up by a merchant ship  in the last few days.  It was heading to Singapore but  there's news today that the ship had to turn around  because the asylum seekers were threatening violence.   What are the details of this report?

JASON CLARE:             That's right.  This all happened on Tuesday.  A ship rang  the Australian Maritime Safety Authority in distress.  We  sent out a broadcast to ships in the area.  A merchant  vessel picked them up early on Tuesday morning.  It then  intended to head to its original destination of Singapore.   The people on the ship then got very aggressive and the  master of the ship made the decision not to go to  Singapore but to go to Christmas Island instead.

Those people are now back at Christmas Island.  They  arrived on Tuesday night.  They now face the prospect  like other people who come by boat over the next few  days of ending up in Nauru.

KIERAN GILBERT:       And in terms of Nauru, the reconnaissance team, when  will they be there?  Initially we thought they'd arrive  tomorrow.  Is that still on track?

JASON CLARE:             We've brought that forward by a day now Kieran, so the  recon team will leave today.  They will arrive in Manus  Island tonight and then arrive in Nauru I think tomorrow.   So that's been brought forward by a day.

It's important that we do this work as quick as we can

and set up processing as quick as we can.  That will send  the strongest possible message to people smugglers that  the game is over.

KIERAN GILBERT:       You will be hoping that the boat's slow though because  the facilities in Nauru are limited aren't they.  It's going to  take months to build the permanent facilities and at best  under the Howard Government solution I think it was  seven-hundred-and-fifty people housed.  So it's not a  great deal.

JASON CLARE:             No, but we do need to do it as quickly as possible.   Remember what this is all about.  It's about stopping  people dying.  You mentioned that boat on Tuesday.   When those people arrived at Christmas Island on  Tuesday night they told us that one of the people on that  boat had fallen overboard.  So that's another person that  now we understand has died at sea.

The time for politics on this has long passed.  It's about  saving people's lives.  We've got another story today of  another person who's been lost at sea.  We need to do  this and implement it as quickly as we can.

KIERAN GILBERT:       There are still a lot of human rights concerns.  The  UNHCR says Australia's at risk of breaching its  international obligations.  The resettlement's based on  individual protection needs not time spent in a queue.   That's going to be tough to deliver.  Particularly given a lot  of your own colleagues are reticent to say the least about  this policy.

JASON CLARE:             This is tough.  Make no bones about it.  This is a  wretched area of public policy and there are no easy  choices.  But understand what this is about.  People are  coming to Australia by boat because they think it's the  fastest way to get to Australia.  What compassionate  people like Angus Houston have said is you need a no  advantage test.  So you don't get to Australia any quicker  by coming by boat than you would if you went through the  UN process in Jakarta.

And that's the key to breaking this system that  encourages people to give a people smuggler ten  thousand dollars to get on a boat and risk their life.

KIERAN GILBERT:       But for those caught up there for years and years there  are going to be real risks of psychological problems.  We  saw that last time.  This is actually going to be tougher  than the Howard Government approach.

JASON CLARE:             Well this is a very, very tough area.  What is different to  what happened under the Howard Government is  independent oversight.  That's something that Paris  Aristotle insisted upon.  It's a very important part of  making sure that people that are very vulnerable are  protected under what is - make no bones about it - a very  tough regime.

KIERAN GILBERT:       And finally Papua New Guinea says they want a formal  agreement, including financial commitments before they  allow the processing to commence.  I think the Howard  Government funded sixty million dollars in terms of  balance of payments funds to PNG.  What sort of ballpark  are we talking this time?

JASON CLARE:             Minister Bowen will begin those discussions.  That's an  area that he's working in right now.  He'll be able to give  you more details over the course of the next few weeks.

KIERAN GILBERT:       Okay Minister thanks for your time.

JASON CLARE:             Thanks Kieran.
