AUSTRALIA'S ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL RELATIONS  WITH SOUTH EAST ASIA

Following is the text of an address by the Minister

for Foreign A f f a i r s ,  Mr Andrew P e a c o c k ,  to the Bradfield  Liberal Electorate Conference and Speakers Forum Limited in  Sydney on 23 November l979.

AUSTRALIA'S ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL RELATIONS

WITH SOUTH EAST ASIA

Increasingly over the past few years Australia has been

focussing sharper attention on the political "situations and on economic

developments in our neighbouring region. We have also increasingly

been pursuing the opportunities that have opened for us in North Asia.

We are being spurred by rapidly changing circumstances to adapt our

thinking and our policies to the new circumstances which have developed

to our north. More than ever before these will shape Australia's own

future. In saying this, I am thinking not only of the impact on

Government policy. Australia as a nation and Australians as individuals,

as businessmen and private citizens, are coming to realise

the need for responding responsibly and effectively to both challenges

and opportunities there. We arc conscious of the impossibility of

simply sitting on the sidelines watching with indifference the developments

to our north. -

At the heart of this judgement is the continuing acceptance

that South East Asia - by its very geographic position - is of enduring

politico-strategic importance to Australia, and that North East Asia

is a lynch pin in the political and economic development of both tfie

so-called "developed", world and henfie of immense importance for our own

strategic and economic security. .

Ã¢ÂÂ   Â·- It was awareness of the importance of South East Asia that led

successive Australian Governments over the previous two decades to place

high priority on the maintenance of good and friendly relations with

Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand - members

of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN). In those days,

most Australians tended to sec these bilateral relationships primarily in

terms of defence. Rarely, however, did Australians think about the need to

build more intimate and durable ties with the countries of South East

Asia, even after the political changes and' Shifts in great power balances

that took place in the region in the mid-seventies.

This has changed , The developments in Indo-China since late

last year have not only brought our like-minded ASEAN neighbours

closer together but have also reinforced our political relations with

them. On top of this, is the ever-increasing importance of economic .

relations between ASEAN countries and Australia, I would like to

examine with you these two sides of our relations with ASEAN.

Political Relations with ASEAN ’

The ASEAN Governments have as their first priority the promotion

of the economic and social development of their peoples. To achieve

this, they need peace in their region, freedom from interference by

outside powers and friendly co-operation between the countries of the Ã¢ÂÂ

region, and with powers beyond it. They see their own intra-regional ‘ ' ’ - s '"

co-operation as a means of strengthening the efforts of the individual

member countries to achieve these goals.  Australia wholeheartedly

supports both the goals and the regional cooperation developed to achieve .

them. Vie see ASEAN as one of the. ntost important elements working for

peace and stability in our region.

Australia and the ASEAN countries share very deep concerns over

the present situation in Indo China and we have been in close consultation

with ASEAN Governments on policies of both political and humanitarian natures

No Australian should forget the cold-facts of the recent political

strategic events in our near north: the Vietnamese invasion of Kampuchea,

continuing Soviet support for Vietnam, the Chinese incursion into Vietnam

and the mass exodus of refugees from Kampuchea, Vietnam and even from

Laos. All the ASEAN countries have felt their impact. Thailand, which

has received hundreds of thousands of war-refugees on its territory,

faces daily risks of border clashes. Malaysia, is the front line

country for Vietnamese boat refugees. The others, and Australia, have

also felt the serious impact of the refugee flow.

Soviet support for Vietnam and Si no-Vietnamese enmity has

played no small role in these developments. The introduction of great

power intervention into South East Asia and the pursuit of interventionist

policies by Vietnam itself is of major concern.

All this has placed regional stability in jeopardy, as well as

causing significant problems in the ASEAN countries. Simply caring

for the. refugees on a purely humanitarian basis places great burdens

on countries such as Thailand, .Indonesia and Malaysia. The implementation

of these countries' economic and social objectives has been affected by

the additional strains put on them.

Australia is acting in close consultation with the countries of

ASEAN' on the serious situation posed by the conflict in Kampuchea and the

-  4  -

refugee outflow. We have both called on numerous occasions for a negotiated

'  and lasting settlement of the conflict that would allow the Kampuchean

people to decide their future for themselves. Most recently, Australia

has supported ASEAN resolutions in the General Assembly of the United

Nations proposing solutions both on Kampuchea and the refugees. These

various actions have been designed to prevent a worsening of events that

have already had serious effects on the"stability of the region.

These events cannot have failed to bring home to all Australians

that South East Asia and Australia form part of the same wider region.

Regional stability is an enduring goal which Australia shares with ASEAN.

We cannot politically stand by idly when there is a risk that fighting Â·

could spill over into nearby countries, possibly as a result of the flow

of refugees into Thailand or a worsening of Sino-Vietnamese relations.

International pressure, in which the ASEAN countries and

Australia have played a prominent role, has slowed the flow of boat

refugees. But there has been no respite for the Kampucheans. The

refugee problem must be solved at its source. The Government of Vietnam

must continue to honour the undertakings it has given to help solve

the problem of Indo-Chinese refugees. It must show concern for '  "

the innocent victims of its actions in Kampuchea. Membership of the

international community brings with it obligations of responsibility

and respect for human rights. I trust Vietnam will continue to.respect

such concepts. Continuing international efforts must be made towards

bringing about a peace in Kampuchea ..tiat is in line with the principles

of self-determination and freedom from outside interference.

Economic Relations with newly Industrialising ASEAN Countries

Let me now turn to the widening economic opportunities

which are opening up for Australia in the region.

I wonder how many Australians know that the ASEAN group

of countries has had one .of the highest rates of economic growth in

the world in this decade. By 1975, the ASEAN countries had already

achieved an average GNP growth rate of 6 percent and have maintained

similar rates since then. Recently the overall growth has been more tha;

double the GNP growth of the OECD nations. Indeed some observers see

ASEAN as the newest "growth centre"'following the paths taken by J a p a n ,

the Republic of Korea and Hong Kong. At present the countries of

ASEAN export the bulk of the w o r l d 1s natural r u b b e r ,  palm oil, copra

and tin. They also have significant amounts of o i l ,  natural gas and

other resources. In a d d i t i o n ,  their 250 million people offer a market

for foodstuffs, minerals, manufactured goods and services which is

of enormous long-term potential.

We all know the course of Japan's "economic miracle". Last

week's announcement of Australian uranium sales to the Republic of

Korea must have reminded us forcibly that the R0I< t o o ,  is already well

into a dynamic phase of industrial development and income growth that i:

increasingly requiring more raw materials and other products.from

Ã¢ÂÂ¢Australia. During my recent visit., to Korea it was clear that the politi

al crisis created by the assassination of President Park on 26 October

had not affected the stability of that country or changed the strong

determination of the R0I< to pursue rapid economic development and active

international trade. Already the ROK has an immensely strong '

industrial base and in many areas, 'for example steel production, they

have technology as advanced as any in "the world.

6 .

New countries are entering the ranks of the world's industrial

powers, with the result that competition in international trade in

manufactured goods can be expected to increase sharply. There will be

tension between those seeking new markets for the products of their

rapidly expanding industrial bases and those seeking to preserve their

former positions at a time when their production costs arc rising.

Already we have seen the countries of f.urope form a trading bloc which

protects their interests. IVc must accept that other nations, while

maintaining commitments to global trading policies, will seek advantage

through regional or bloc trading arrangements.

What people in this country have to realise is that we have on

our own doorstep-the embryo of a potentially powerful regional economic

arrangement. We must recognise and seek to exploit for our industry

the potential of a market of 250 million people-and a source of low cost

goods. Despite some fundamental social and economic problems, the

countries of ASEAN arc making great strides in manufacturing development.

They arc seeking to use effectively, their-major-resource, labour, through

the creation of labour intensive industries. But there.are in ASEAN-

also important advanced capital.intensive industries. .The ASEAN countries

are increasingly taking'concerted action-to ensure that'they have reliable

7

export outlets. Clearly, they will be reluctant to let countries take

advantage of the new prospects they offer if their trading partners

are not prepared to allow ASEAN the quid pro quo of reasonable access to

the local market sectors now served by uneconomic industries.

We are faced with a double challenge:

- to take advantage of the opportunities ASEAN will increasingly

offer to Australian exporters an'd investors; and

- to ensure that ASEAN countries have good access to

Australian markets - at the same time, to reconcile these

moves with Australia's global trading patterns and with

domestic circumstances.

This challenge is not simply limited to ASEAN.  It applies with equal,

force to Taiwan, Hong Kong and the Republic of Korea, whose two-way

trade and investment with ASEAN is growing. .These three growing trading

entities, with Japan, the United States and the EEC, already have their

feet in the ASEAN door. By comparison Australia has little more than its

toe in the door. .  ..

One of the reasons that we have been slow to take advantage

of the opportunities which have opened up for us in South East Asia,

is.that our people do not know enough about the region, its people, and

its business systems. A major part of Australian activity in the region

is located in Malaysia and Singapore, countries we know well as fellow

members of the Commonwealth and whose business systems have more

in common with our own. But Thailand, the Philippines-and Indonesia

- ÃÂ´ -

are all embarking On ambitious industrial expansion programs worth

billions of dollars. Australian industry may not yet be able to supply

an entire chemical fertiliser plant worth a billion dollars. But in such

a major project, the supply of component parts is often sub-contracted

to smaller producers, l ' . ' e  have recently established the Australian

"Overseas Projects Corporation to act as a catalyst for cooperation

between exporters. Let us take full advantage of the opportunities to

win contracts for our resources~based exports based in both the larger

and medium dollar bracket. *

Australia, too, should be able to provide investment appropriate

to ASLAN's needs. The scale and technology of many Australian operations

arc suited to the stage of industrial development now existing in-the

region. Government-established machinery exists to help the flow of

investment to the region.

The Government can, however, only do so much. It is up to the

Australian private sector to use its imagination and enterprise to

recognise and participate in these markets now. Established contacts

and trading arrangements between businessmen which are made now will help

to guarantee Australia a greater share of the ASEAN market as it cpntinues

to expand in the years to come. _ '  Ã¢ÂÂ

. '  '  . '  "  '  '

Co-operation in the trade and resources area, the export of

Australian expertise and technology in joint enterprise arrangements with

ASEAN companies and Australian direct investment in ASEAN will not only

help the economic relationship, but it will also help ensure Australia's

future as a trading nation and help consolidate political relations.

-  9  -

Tliere is, for example, a great opportunity for sales of advanced or

medium technology while ASEAN economies are at the present stage of

development. It is a competitive field - Singapore is already out-stripping

Australia in some technological sectors such as information systems.

The Government is aware that Australia's overall trade balance

with ASEAN is at present in Australia's favour. This applies also to

Korea, and I  long Kong. Singapore is one of the few countries I am discussing

here which has a trade surplus with Australia. In 1978/79, Australian

exports to the five ASEAN countries were valued at $A1,089 million and

our imports from ASEAN were valued at $642 million. In overall terms

7.7% of Australia's exports go to ASEAN, while only 4.7% of our imports

come from ASEAN. While both ASEAN countries and Australia pursue global

trading policies we are however mindful that trade is a two-way business.

The Government is assisting ASEAN countries to improve their export

performance. Last year we sponsored an ASEAN Trade Fair in Sydney and we

plan to have another in Melbourne next year. We have recently agreed to

a series of bilateral trade initiatives. In the trade - related investment

field Australia has sponsored an Industrial Co-operation Conference with

the ASEAN countries. From time to time, we have adjusted the Australian

System of Tariff Preferences for developing countries such as those in

ASEAN in order to help them achieve competitive status with the developed

countries.  Most recently, my colleague the Minister for Trade and

Resources, Mr Anthony, announced a package of initiatives that would give

developing countries a greater opportunity to penetrate the Australian

10

market. Previously British products had enjoyed an advantage of tariff

preference over developing countries. These preferences are to be

removed on 1 January 19-80 from about 500. tariff items, with a total trade

value of close to $ÃÂ4ÃÂ1 million. In botli the interests of fairness and

of course for our future profit, we arc continuing to give ASEAN the

maximum access possible which the economic and social realities in

Australia allow. The Government will continue to-consult with the ASEAN

countries on ways to expand our two-way trade.

In the longer term this process will be helped by the process

of market-led structural adjustment. Some restructuring of Australian .

high-cost industry is inevitable and has already begun. It results from

both cost factors and changing technology. However, the Government

recognises that restructuring, particularly in the manufacturing sector,

and as recommended by the Crawford-Committee Report, must-proceed at a

pace which avoids undue social and economic disruption. .

Much lias been done, particularly through the Australia Korea

Business Co-operation Committee, to develop an economic partnership with

the Republic of Korea. If we dan move to a similar partnership now with

the ASEAN countries, the process of^encouraging in Australia the growth

of complementary, economically competitive, export-oriented manufacturing

industries which take advantage of our natural resources, skills and

technology will be so much easier. We must seek to involve ourselves in

the economic growth of our nearest neighbours. If we don't, others most

assuredly will.
