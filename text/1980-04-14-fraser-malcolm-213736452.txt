PRESENTATION OF THE THORN AWARDS  TO TELEVISION NEWS INDUSTRY  .  AT NATIONAL PRESS CLUB

It- is a pleasure to be here at the National Press Club again  - I always feel as though I am among friends.  This day .   means a great deal forÃ¢ÂÂ so many men and women in Australia's  television news industry - as it should.  Too often we

armchair critics have little grasp of the sheer hard slog,  the creative effort and discipline that makes up that  half hour of news and current affairs.

So these awards - awards highly regarded by this  industry - pay tribute where tribute is due. In 1980,  television news programs play a role that cannot be  underestimated in shaping community attitudes. The starkness  of war;  its legacy of refugees ... the sheer inhumanity  of terrorism ... the ecstasy of a sportsman in a moment of

triumph; the agony in a moment of defeat - these images  not only provide us with information but help shape the way  we feel and the'way we act.

When I first became a politician almost 25 years ago,  there  was no television in Australia. There were no Harveys or  Petersons or Oakes or Fairweathers or Willesees to make  life easier. In the early days,  television news copy

came from the newspapers. There were no television  bureaux in the national capital. But this changed in the  late sixties and early seventies.

The networks set up bureaux and appointed political . correspondents; international news was satellited into  .  our lounge rooms and we saw the great news events as they  happened - and not at the whim of the airline schedules.

Perhaps that was a fair criticism of our television news in the early days - it forgot that we were part of a world community and that international news had a legitimate place. Perhaps also there was a feeling that unless

there were pictures to go with a story then .it was not worth covering. I hope those days are behind us.

Each of you in this room has a considerable responsibility  to the 80 per cent of Australians who get 90 per cent of  their news from television. You have a responsibility to be  eternally on your guard not to sacrifice substance for  .  sugar coating. Sure, there is a need for the attractive

package, the excellent picture - but substance must not  be compromised. . .  ./2

I know Canberra is a "talking head" town for the television  journalist - it is generally without the scope for the visual  drama that television thrives on. But that does not mean  that a story of substance,  a story of relevance, should be  ignored or buried because it carries no lively footage .. or  because a news editor,  or producer, thinks it will look  a bit dull.  .

I believe Australians are interested in issues. The success  of our many radio and television current affairs programs  is fair evidence of this. Trivia and flim flam has its  place - but not,  I submit, at. the expense of factual and

substantive news.

I am not in show business, yet neither are you. Credibility  and consistency are just as important for your profession  as it is for mine.  I am held accountable to the electorate  for my Government's decisions - because of the power of

television you are accountable for the time you spend in  our homes.  .

After that gentle advice, can I now make the point that our  news services are close to or equal to the best in the  world. The technical excellence and quality of production  stand any comparison. It is amazing what modern television

equipment can do - a camera followed me into the bowels of  a submarine in Hawaii earlier this year, without lights and  long cords and all those things I used to associate with  television. I am assured the picture came out okay.

The quality of our news programs stands up to the best test  of all - is there someone out there watching?

Australia's evening news bulletins and current affairs  programs are consistently at the top of the ratings.

I know ratings are not necessarily an infallible guide to  quality - but in the case of news, a discerning audience  is quick to spot second best or second rate.

Television news has given us some great moments,  some  tragic moments - Neil Armstrong taking man's first step on  the moon; the assassination of President Kennedy; the  subsequent murder of his assassin.

In Australia, television news has given us the moving and  eloquent coverage of the Menzies funeral; the heartbreak of  Cyclone Tracey;  disasters at Granville and West Gate.

We have seen the world's stories; the world has seen ours. The communications satellite has indeed given us the global  village; and that has meant that Australia has a responsibility  to have its own reporters, cameramen and photographers

around the world. .

This audience would know better than any what this can  mean. The newsmen killed in Timor,  Tony Joyce fatally  wounded in Zambia - these are the terrible and jolting  reminders o f .the dangers involved in keeping Australia informed.

Let us never be lulled into takingÂ· for granted the news  from the world's trouble spots. Let us never underestimate  the pride and professionalism of our news gatherers. That's  what this day is all about - to reward individual pride

and accomplishment; and above all, to recognise the continuing  pursuit of excellence.

Of course,  for a politician,  television news and broadcasting  can be fun.  I can recall with pleasure some of my more  enjoyable moments on television; chatting away with  Richard Carleton, and a long while ago,  with George Negus.

I invariably got bags of fan mail after these light-hearted  tete-a-tetes.  -I am also only too well aware of the hazards of broadcasting,   even from the relative sanctuary of my office. A few years  ago,  late one evening, I sat down in my Melbourne office to  record my weekly broadcast to my constituents - the good  people of Wannon. It was my weekly stand-up.  I think it  was about the 1,000th such occasion I had sat down to

it - as I had been recording it every week for 21 years. I read the first couple of paragraphs onto a tape in an old Tandberg, and as I was a little tired (but not emotionally)  I made an error of speech. Most uncharacteristically,  I  gave anÂ·involuntary exclamation - words not fit to be  repeated here - stopped the tape and started again. In your

language, "take two".  The tape was duly landlined to Radio 3HA  Hamilton in my electorate, with a warning of a false start.  However, somewhere along the line, that message did not get  through - the tape went to air (on a Sunday evening too) false

start and all. The most disturbing aspect of the incident  however, was that the station did not receive a single complaint.   Surely, that meant only two things - no-one was actually  tuned in, or those that were, thought it was the normal  Prime Ministerial manner of speech.

Ladies and gentlemen, I know you have not come here to the  National Press Club today to listen to me - but to hear news  of the Judge's decisions for the Thorn Awards.
