BENSON:                   Treasurer, good morning.

TREASURER:           Good morning Marius, good to be with you.

BENSON:                   Good to have you with us.  Let me explain that we are speaking  about, not some of the issues I was just covering with Melissa, but another issue that  was debated in parliament yesterday, this is the Parliamentary Budget Office.  This is  a body which would cost election promises and policies put forward by both the  Government and the Opposition.  The plan did have bipartisan support but Joe  Hockey, the Shadow Treasurer, now says he wants to amend proposals for this office,  which costs around $25 million - a substantial office.  He does want costings kept  confidential in the white heat of an election campaign.  Is that a reasonable thing?  I  mean, you’re lobbing up policies to this independent body, you don't want to decide  on the policies until you get the costings, just keep them quiet until we make up our  mind.

TREASURER:           That is absolutely outrageous.  The whole point of an  independent costing service is that the Australian public can see during an election  campaign whether the financial estimates and costings put forward by both the  Government or the Opposition are accurate.  And we know what happened in the last  election campaign: an $11 billion black hole in the budget estimates of the Opposition  which wasn't revealed until after the election.  And because that occurred we agreed  with the independents and the minor parties, and I thought we’d agreed with the  Liberal Party, that we would establish an independent costing service so that in the

next election campaign there would be full openness, full transparency so the  Australian public could see the independent costings of the Opposition and the  Government from either the Treasury or from the independent costing service, the  Parliamentary Budget Office.  And then last night and yesterday, through yesterday,  Mr Hockey said they were not going to participate in this despite the fact they sat on  the committee which recommended the legislation, which has been put in there in full,  faithful to the deliberations of the committee on which two Liberal Party Shadow  Ministers sat.

BENSON:                   But what about the Hockey argument, as I understand it, which  is that we’ve got a policy, it might be a good policy, but let’s see what it costs.  Let’s  send it to the independent body.  When they come back and say for example it costs  $20 billion - okay that’s not our policy.  But keep that process confidential because  you don't want to be attacked for policies that you haven’t adopted yet.

TREASURER:           Well, the fact is they can go to the independent costing service  prior to the election and test all of those propositions, okay.  But the most important  thing that we need to have is openness and transparency about the costings during the  election campaign so the Australian people can make a choice.

Now the fact is they’ve changed their mind because they’ve discovered they’ve got a  $70 billion crater in their Budget estimates before they even prepare a new policy for  the next election.  Mr Hockey has said that on television and Mr Robb has said it on

many occasions because they’ve got this $70 billion hole or crater in their budget  estimates they’ve now changed their mind about participating in the independent  costing service.

BENSON:                   Can I ask you a more general question about relations with the  Opposition?  You are a minority government and you may rely, you do rely, on the  Opposition’s support in the key area of asylum seekers at the moment and things don't

seem to be terribly comfortable between the leaders of the Government and the  Opposition.  With the Opposition Leader saying yesterday all I get from you, Julia  Gillard, is bile and her reply: poor petal.  Is person management skills, are they  lacking in the Government at the moment?

TREASURER:           Oh not at all.  This is the most negative Opposition that I’ve  seen in all of my time in parliament and in fact in the whole of my political life.  They  say no to everything.  We’ve been getting our legislation through the parliament -  well over 180 bills through the House of Representatives and much of that has been  opposed tooth and nail by the Liberal and National parties irrespective of whether  they actually agree with it or not because there’s just an ocean of negativity when you  look at what the Liberal Party is doing on just about every area of policy.

Now yesterday we put the proposition to them that Mr Abbott should stick with what  he said just a week ago, that is that he would defend the right of the executive to make  decisions when it comes to people smuggling for offshore processing.  He said he  would do that and he’s walked back from that every day of the week since then.  What  they do is just shamelessly ignore the facts and simply say no to everything.

BENSON:                   Just quickly Treasurer, on another issue in the news, a media  inquiry. The Government is moving to establish one but it won’t look at the question  of ownership of the media.  Many in Labor ranks feel that with Rupert Murdoch  owning about 70 per cent of the print media it’s time to look at that.  What do you  think?

TREASURER:           Well, I don't think it’s a surprise that there’s a high degree of  concentration in the Australian print media.  I don't think anyone is surprised by that  but Minister Conroy, the Communications Minister, will be making an announcement  this morning about an inquiry.  I think it’s a very important inquiry.  I think it’s one in

which all Australians are deeply interested.  The terms of reference for that will be  outlined this morning and I think we’ll have to talk about those terms of reference  after they have been released.

BENSON:                   Just quickly Treasurer, do you think the Murdoch press is  biased against the Government?

TREASURER:           Look I think all of us from time to time will contest a story here  or a story there, and it won’t just be in one particular outlet of the press.  It could well  be right across the electronic media.  But this is not an inquiry that in the first instance

is about bias.  It’s not politicians making judgements about that.  What this is about is  having a look at the proper accountability mechanisms we have in media coverage so  everybody can have some faith that if somebody feels like they have been wronged

then they’ve got some means of redressing it.  That’s just one of the objectives of the  inquiry but it’s not about any particular organisation or outlet.

BENSON:                   Wayne Swan, thanks very much.

TREASURER:           Good to be with you.

(Ends)
