INTERVIEW WITH KERRY O’BRIEN - ABC 7.30 REPORT - 8.15PM TUESDAY 11 MAY 2010

11th May 2010

E&OE……………………….…………………………………………………………………

KERRY O’BRIEN:

Sitting in this chair on this night last year, you described Wayne Swan's budget then as quote, "a plan  for debt that is going to be a massive burden for generations". Looks a little sick on reflection, doesn't  it, against a Budget pledging a return to surplus in three years.

JOE HOCKEY:

Well, last year the Government was promising a recession. Last year the Government was promising  substantial deficit and debt - this year is not much different, Kerry. Again, the Government is  promising to deliver a surplus some time into the future.

KERRY O’BRIEN:

Three years.

JOE HOCKEY:

Three years into the future which means, in my estimation, Kevin Rudd and Wayne Swan will never  deliver a surplus Budget for Australia.

KERRY O’BRIEN:

Why? Sorry, explain your logic.

JOE HOCKEY:

The logic is the Budget is based on false assumptions. They are assuming that we're going to have the  best terms of trade in 60 years. They are assuming there is going to be record levels of investment in  the mining industry. The logic doesn't flow when you look at the fact they're introducing a massive  new mining tax. For example, they're assuming fewer people are going to smoke as a result of higher  taxes. But, they're assuming that there is going to be a significant increase in investment in the mining  sector with new taxes. It just doesn't add up. It's a false assumption.

KERRY O’BRIEN:



So, you’re attacking the credibility of the Treasury estimates as well as the Government itself?

JOE HOCKEY:

Well, last year the Treasury estimates were completely wrong. You just said…

KERRY O’BRIEN:

Treasury estimates are just as they always were, under your Government as well.

JOE HOCKEY:

Well, they were more incorrect last year than at any other time - and you will agree with that, Kerry -  at any other time in recent memory. They were completely wrong. This year it is based all on the  assumption that the mining boom will deliver a great windfall to the Government and yet the  Government is introducing a $9 billion a year new tax.

KERRY O’BRIEN:

Where, what scope is this going to leave you, this Budget going to leave you in terms of framing  policy and in terms of your own new spending and, and against that, what kind of spending cuts are  you going to be looking at and are you going to be able to deliver?

JOE HOCKEY:

We will make hard decisions and you will see that over the next few weeks. We are prepared to make  the hard decisions. We have to have real numbers, Kerry. These aren't real numbers. The  Government…

KERRY O’BRIEN:

But, what about on the policy side, what about on the policy side for instance, with the Government  with their health policies?

JOE HOCKEY:

You will see…

KERRY O’BRIEN:

$7 billion in new spending paid for, and are you going to be able to match the kind of amounts of  money that they are putting into new policy on health?

JOE HOCKEY:

We’re not going to try and match them on spending. The Government has spent an extra $26 billion  on top of last year’s record spending - $26 billion. Even in the fourth year of this term, the  Government is going to be spending more than the last year of the Coalition Government - in the  fourth year.

KERRY O’BRIEN:

Do you acknowledge that they have also kept to their two per cent cap?

JOE HOCKEY:

Well, they’ve shuffled the money around. In fact, when you look carefully at the numbers, for  example, the specific purpose payments in relation to water buybacks, they’re bringing some money  forward so they don’t break their two per cent cap. So they’re playing with the numbers.  Australians

are right to questions this Budget in detail. Everything is based on the assumption that they’re going  to have record terms of trade, the best in 60 years, and some time in the future they will deliver their  first budget surplus. They’ve never delivered a surplus, they never will deliver a surplus.

KERRY O’BRIEN:

No Labor Government has delivered a surplus?

JOE HOCKEY:

No, this Labor Government has never delivered a surplus.

KERRY O’BRIEN:

They’ve only delivered two budgets, this is their third and its…

JOE HOCKEY:

They will never deliver a surplus, Kerry. They will never deliver a surplus. Their spending is reckless.  Look at some of the figures that came out today - they’re going to spend up to a billion dollars  addressing their problems with asylum seekers on our borders. They’re going to spend up to a billion  dollars repairing the pink batt programme that has gone all wrong. Kevin Rudd promised there’d be  no new bureaucracy with his hospital plan yet he’s committed $500 million to a new bureaucracy.  They’re reducing the number of soldiers by 500 and increasing the public servants in Defence by  1,500.

KERRY O’BRIEN:

But they are also cutting public servants in various other departments.

JOE HOCKEY:

Overall the public service is remaining about the same number, Kerry.

KERRY O’BRIEN:

But that wasn’t the case under the Howard Government, was it? It grew in its last five years, the  Howard Government grew enormously.

JOE HOCKEY:

Well you know what? The Howard Government doubled the size of the economy. We doubled the  size of the economy in ten years. These guys are massively increasing expenditure and they’re not  delivering in real outcomes in the economy.

KERRY O’BRIEN:

So apart from the mining tax which Tony Abbott has already committed the Coalition to opposing,  what else from this Budget would you oppose?

JOE HOCKEY:

Well, we will make a number of statements over the next few days. I mean, gosh, we’ve had it for  what, five hours?

KERRY O’BRIEN:

Give us a statement.

JOE HOCKEY:

Well, you belled the cat with the super clinics, GP super clinics. They’ve delivered two.

KERRY O’BRIEN:

Three, I think.

JOE HOCKEY:

Ok, to be fair, three fully operational GP super clinics out of a committed 36 and that programme is  going so well that tonight they committed an extra 23 more. That’s the sort of lack of outcome that  has come to be a definition of the Rudd Government.

KERRY O’BRIEN:

Will you take the opportunity in your Budget in Reply speech on Thursday to spell out how quickly  you’d return the Budget to surplus?

JOE HOCKEY:

We will outline in our speech, in Tony Abbott’s speech on Thursday, a number of initiatives that will  frame our Budget policy. I can assure you that there…

KERRY O’BRIEN:

But will you…

JOE HOCKEY:

There’s two things I can give you an assurance on. Firstly, the numbers that we talk about will be real  numbers, not pretend, not fake, not based on false assumptions. And the second thing is, we will  make…

KERRY O’BRIEN:

Will you be in a position to say when a Coalition Government would return the Budget to surplus?

JOE HOCKEY:

A real surplus? Absolutely. We will. We will do that.

KERRY O’BRIEN:

No, no I’m saying, will you say when you’ll do that in Tony Abbott's speech on Thursday?

JOE HOCKEY:

Well, you’re simply asking about the framework of the Thursday speech. Before the election, in the  next few weeks, I promise you, you will have a very clear indication of our Budget savings, how  we're go to pay for our promises, but they will be real numbers, Kerry. They’re not going to be  pretend numbers. They’re not going to be based on a wish and a prayer.

KERRY O’BRIEN:

And sorry, just so that I’ve got this clear, this is going to be in the next few weeks…

JOE HOCKEY:

Yep.

KERRY O’BRIEN:

And in that time frame you will also say when you would return the Budget to surplus?

JOE HOCKEY:

Absolutely.

KERRY O’BRIEN:

Ok.

JOE HOCKEY:

I tell you what, the best way to turn the Budget to surplus is to have faster growth and you do not have  faster growth with a $9 billion a year tax on the mining sector. And you do not speed up the field of  athletes by putting a ball and chain around your fastest runner.

KERRY O’BRIEN:

Very quickly, just like the Government and just like Treasury you will be relying on forecasts on  which to build your case?

JOE HOCKEY:

Well, you rely on the numbers in the Budget but I can promise you that we are not going to buy into  higher taxes like the tobacco tax and like the mining tax which underpins Kevin Rudd’s Budget.

KERRY O’BRIEN:

I thought the tobacco tax was your tax?

JOE HOCKEY:

Well, mate, not on that scale, can I tell you. This is a grand scale increase from Kevin Rudd.

KERRY O’BRIEN:

Joe Hockey, thanks very much for talking with us.

JOE HOCKEY:

Any time. Thank you.
