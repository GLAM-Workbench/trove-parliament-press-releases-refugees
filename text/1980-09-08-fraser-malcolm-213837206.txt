170

The second meeting of Commonwealth Heads of   Government of the Asia-Pacific Region was held in New Delhi   from 4-8 September 1980. Heads of Government who attended   the Meeting were the Prime Minister of Australia,  the   President of Bangladesh,  the Prime Minister of Fiji, the   Prime Minister of India,  the President of Kiribati, the

Prime Minister of Malaysia,  the President of Nauru,  the   Prime Minister of New Zealand, the Prime Minister of   Papua New Guinea, the Prime Minister of Singapore,  the   Prime Minister of Solomon Islands,  the President of Sri Lanka,   the Prime Minister of Tonga,  the Prime Minister of Tuvalu,   the Prime Minister of Vanuatu and the Prime Minister of   Western Samoa. The Prime Minister of India,  Shrimati Indira   Gandhi, was in the chair.

2. Heads of Government welcomed the valuable opportunity   provided by this meeting to discuss in an informal atmosphere   matters of common interest to them, including problems of a global nature.  They agreed that there was ample scope for

a united approach to matters 6f concern to all countries of   the region. They examined in this cpntext various specific   and concrete programs and proposals for practical co-operation   among the countries represented.  .

3. Heads of Government noted with particular satisfaction   that since their last meeting two years ago,  four more countries   in the Pacific, who following the attainment of independence   had become members of the Commonwealth, were participating

in this meeting,  namely Solomon Islands, Kiribati, Tuvalu and   Vanuatu. They felt that the Pacific Island countries should   be able to look with confidence towards the Commonwealth in   particular and the international community in general to help

them to tackle their special problems of development.

WORLD AND REGIONAL POLITICAL TRENDS .

4. Heads of Government,  recognising the significant   impact which events and developments since they last met   had had on the peace and stability of the Asian region,   reviewed the current international strategic and political

situation. They noted with grave concern the deterioration   in the overall situation,  including the prospects of   confrontation between great powers in the region.  They   addressed their attention in particular to the consequences

and implications of the crises in Afghanistan and Kampuchea. They also noted the intensification of great power military   presence in the Indian Ocean. Recognising the political,   security, economic and social ramifications of these events,   Heads of Government stressed the urgency of the resolution   of the differences by peaceful means.  They reaffirmed

their conviction that relations between states should be   based on, respect for sovereignty, equality, independence and territorial integrity.  They affirmed the inadmissability   of the use of force in international relations and of

intervention and interference in the internal affairs of states.

The Indian Ocean

5. Heads of Government noted with concern that

despite the expressed wishes of the littoral and hinterland  states,  great power military presence in the Indian Ocean  has increased and that there has been a deterioration of  peace and security in the Indian Ocean area. They further

noted with regret that recent events in the region,  together  with the worsening international situation, have caused a  further build-up of great power military presence. While

regretting the suspension of the bilateral talks on arms  limitation in the Indian Ocean between the Soviet Union and  the United States and reaffirming their commitment to the  ultimate establishment of a Zone of Peace in the Indian  Ocean in accordance with the 1971 UN Declaration,  they  called upon the great powers to take active and effective

steps to remove existing sources of tension in the area. In the absence of such steps progress towards such a Zone  would be difficult. They expressed the hope that the  proposed UN Conference on the Indian Ocean in Sri Lanka

next year would make a positive contribution to the  implementation of the Declaration.

Afghanistan

6. Heads of Government noted with grave concern the

situation which had developed in Afghanistan and agreed  that it carried dangerous implications for the peace and  stability of the region.  While noting that there were  differing perceptions as to the circumstances leading up

to the present situation,  they emphasised that if a  political settlement acceptable to all involved and  affected parties was not found,  a further deterioration  including a possibility of great power confrontation was  unavoidable. Pending such a settlement they stressed the  need to de-escalate tensions. They expressed their full

support for the independence,  sovereignty,  territorial  integrity and non-aligned status of Afghanistan and other  countries of the region. They urged the concerned parties  to work towards a settlement which would ensure that the  Afghan people would determine their own destiny free from  foreign interference and intervention.

Kampuchea

7. Heads of Government expressed grave concern over the persistence of foreign intervention and interference in  Kampuchea.  The situation which existed affected the peace  and security of the whole region.  They were convinced that,  to bring about durable: peace and stability in South-east Asia,  there was an urgent need for a comprehensive political  solution to the Kampuchean problem which would ensure the  sovereignty,  independence and neutrality of Kampuchea. Heads  o f .Government were convinced of the need for the withdrawal  of foreign forces from that country.  They were also convinced  of the necessity tp create a climate of peace and security in

Kampuchea which would enable the people of that country to  determine their future destiny free from outside interference.

8. Urging all states in South-east Asia to develop

peaceful,  friendly and harmonious relations, Heads of  Government noted with approval the efforts being made for  the: early establishment of a Zone of Peace, Freedom and  Neutrality in the region and called upon all states to  lend their fullest support to these efforts. They  expressed their conviction that a comprehensive political  solution of the Kampuchean question would contribute to  the realisation of such a Zone of Peace.

Refugees

9. Heads of Government agreed that among the most

pressing humanitarian issues facing them was the plight  of approximately two million refugees in the Asian region.  Heads of Government commended international efforts being  undertaken under the auspices of the United Nations as  well as the individual efforts by various countries to

alleviate the plight of these refugees, including where  possible to enable them to return voluntarily to their  homelands". They nevertheless recognised that much more

needed to be done to assist the refugees and the countries  giving them temporary shelter. They also expressed the  hope that the international community would intensify its  efforts to bring relief to all people in the region who  have suffered untold rigours of famine and deprivation and  have been displaced by war, disease and hunger.

South Pacific

10. Heads of Government agreed that regional co-operation could contribute significantly to the  capability of member states in the South Pacific in  overcoming their problems. They also agreed that it was

vital for the peace and stability of the region that all  peoples of the South Pacific were afforded the opportunity  to exercise their, right to self-determination as laid down  in the UN Charter. They expressed the conviction that  this right precluded interference by any country or outside  elements in any form.

Zimbabwe

11. Heads of Government expressed deep satisfaction at the Commonwealth's significant role in Zimbabwe's . accession to freedom and independence. They recalled the  basis for a political settlement in Zimbabwe had been laid

at the Lusaka Meeting of Commonwealth Heads of Government  in 1979 and that the Commonwealth has played a central  part in the subsequent processes which led to free and  fair elections and independence. They noted that all  Commonwealth countries of the Asia-Pacific Region had  contributed, in various ways, to this notable achievement  which had further strengthened the Commonwealth's solidarity

and sense of purpose.

Middle East

12. Heads of Government noted with deep concern that the situation in the Middle East,  including recent  developments,  remained critical,  posing a continuing threat  to global peace and security. They reaffirmed the necessity

of urgently seeking a just settlement of the problem on the  basis of the relevant resolutions of the UN General Assembly  and the Security Council and the recognition of the legitimate

and inalienable rights of the Palestian people.

INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ISSUES

International Economic Situation

13. Heads of Government reviewed the trends in the

world economy since they last met and assessed present  prospects. They viewed with serious concern the world  economic crisis.  There was a marked slowdown in world  economic activity and growth,  increased unemployment,  high  levels of inflation,  and an unprecedented balance of  payments problem.  At the same time they felt that the  world economy was so interdependent that common economic  problems could only be resolved by concerted action by all  countries. This also entailed the exertion of the

necessary political will on the part of the developed  countries.

14. Heads of Government stressed that this crisis  situation,  especially in the light of its consequences for  economic welfare and political stability,  deserved the most  urgent attention by the international community. Inward

looking national approaches would not only prove ineffective  but could also be counter productive. Bold international  action involving the whole international community deserved  serious consideration.

15. In this connection,  Heads of Government welcomed  the report of the Brandt Commission "A Program for Survival"  and the report of the Commonwealth group of experts,  "The  World Economic Crisis". They felt that both reports were

timely and complementary and their emphasis on interdependence  and mutuality of interest in structural change was a  constructive response to the present impasse in the  North/South dialogue and the need for bold and imaginative  solutions. They commended the recommendations for serious  consideration and support,  as appropriate,  by the  international community in the forthcoming global negotiations.

16. Heads of Government welcomed the decision of the

UN General Assembly to set up a new global round of  negotiations on international economic co-operation in.1981. In this connection they urged every co-operation to ensure a successful outcome at the current special session of the  UN General Assembly. They expressed the hope that the global

. .  ./5

5 .

round would usher in a new era of fruitful and constructive  negotiations in the 1980's and they agreed to give maximum  support to ensuring its success. Recognising the need for  wide support at the highest political level, they endorsed

the recommendation of the Brandt Commission for a limited  and representative informal summit. .

17. Heads of Government regarded the mounting  payments deficits of developing countries and widening  global payments imbalances as one of the urgent and  indeed critical problems facing the world community. They

stressed that greater intermediation by international  financial institutions was crucial to promoting the  recycling of surpluses, ensuring greater participation by  the least developed, most seriously affected, the landlocked

and the island developing countries, and facilitating a smooth  adjustment process. In this connection they drew attention to the innovative approach to the recyling process  recommended by the Commonwealth experts group and commended

it for urgent consideration by the international community.

18. Heads of Government noted that many developing  countries had been gravely affected in the past year by a  combination of adverse international factors. These had  created an acute balance of payments problem, which had  critically aggravated their overall economic situation. In

these circumstances and, given the difficulty of the least  developed, most seriously affected, landlocked and island  developing countries in borrowing on acceptable commercial  terms and conditions, they felt that there was urgent need

to augment substantially the flow of financial resources on  sustained concessional terms and on a predictable long term  basis. Such assistance was immediately required as balance  of payments support to maintain their level of economic

activity and to achieve even minimal development objectives . At the same time, significant additional assistance, as well  as appropriate domestic policies were required to enable these  countries to make necessary medium term adjustments, more  especially by developing their energy potential,  building up

their infrastructure, and augmenting their export capacities.

Trade Policy

19. Recognising that freer and expanding world trade  was an area of strong mutuality of interest between countries.  Heads of Government expressed concern at the continuing  trend of rising protectionism and the possibility of a sudden  escalation should the recession deepen. They expressed the  belief that positive adjustment policies and the dissemination

of information on the advantages of freer trade could greatly  help governments to resist political pressures for  protectionism. They agreed to support international action  for the encouragement and monitoring of positive adjustment  policies. They noted that although some positive results of significant benefit to major developed countries were  achieved in the recently concluded multilateral trade

.  . ./6

6 .

negotiations,  in the context of products of export  interest to the region the results were far from satisfactory.  In this connection they noted the lack of attention given,  to increasing quantitative restraints and other new  protectionist devices adopted contrary to both the spirit  and the letter of the GATT, and the limited attention given  to the liberation of agricultural trade. They agreed to  work together in support of efforts to secure better access

for their products in the major consuming countries.

20. They reiterated their faith in the present GATT

rules which allowed neither selective safeguards nor  conditional MFN action and agreed to work together to  ensure that the safeguards under the present system were

preserved.

21. They noted that the negotiations on the future of

the multi-fibre arrangement would soon start. The  participating countries agreed that a return to the  provisions of the original MFA and the setting of a time  limit for the abandonment of the MFA was the minimum  desirable goal in the negotiations.

Commodities and the Common Fund

22. Heads of Government welcomed the conclusion of negotiations within UNCTAD to set up a common fund and noted  the constructive role played by previous Commonwealth fora  and the Commonwealth Secretariat, in helping to bring about  a positive outcome.They agreed to continue working together  constructively in supporting the operation of the fund and

its further development. They viewed with concern the slow  progress in negotiating new international commodity  agreements and the recent setbacks in::renegotiating existing  agreements, and offered their full co-operation in helping  to ensure faster progress in setting up international  commodity agreements.

Economic and Technical Co-operation Among Developing  Countries

23. Heads of Government reaffirmed the growing relevance of economic and technical co-operation amongst developing  countries Which would constitute an additional input to  global development efforts. They stressed that such

co-operation required adequate support from the developed  countries, multilateral development agencies and  international financial institutions. They observed that  the lack of information as to the capabilities of the

developing countries was a major impediment to such  co-operation and they urged the Commonwealth Secretariat to  give attention to measures designed to bridge the  information gap. They noted with appreciation that the

Secretariat was already making extensive use of these  capabilities in its programs and they asked it to make  maximum it&e of these resources in programs in the region.

REGIONAL ECONOMIC AND FUNCTIONAL CO-OPERATION

Regional Trade

24. Heads of Government accepted the recommendations  contained in the Report of the Consultative Group on Trade.

25. Heads of Government noted with concern that

protectionism is on the increase, particularly against the  labour intensive or lower cost exports of countries of the  region. Most developing countries have severe balance of

payments problems and need to expand export opportunities  for their competitive products in order to pay for their  imports mainly from developed countries.

26. Developed countries and,  in particular,  those  which exercise the major influence over world trade,  should not seek to avoid the realities of international competitiveness  and should^make a determined effort to liberalise trade

through the adoption of positive adjustment policies.

27. Heads of Government paid particular attention to  the reference by the consultative group to the longstanding  and persistent protectionist policies of the major  industrialised countries against competitive exports of  industrial and agricultural.products of member countries of the region. They considered that the group should,  as  a matter of urgency,  make these policies the subject of  detailed examination and report. They also agreed on the  need for the consultative group to examine and report on  measures to facilitate the liberalisation of trade within

the region,  recognising that economic co-operation between  member countries needed to be strengthened as part of the  process of improving access to developed country markets  of the exports of developing countries.

28. They decided that the group's terms of reference

should be broadened to include economic development issues  in order that the potential for development of member  countries may be explored in a more effective manner.. The  additional terms of reference are as follows:-- Study mutually beneficial ways and means to facilitate

Â· . .  a better use of resources,  diversify production and obtain more fruitful specialisation to promote  international trade within the region specially with  a view to accelerating the economic development of the  developing countries.

- Explore avenues where two or more countries may be able  to co-operate on joint ventures and on projects which would maximise the economic and trading opportunities  of the countries concerned. .

- Examine possibilities for mutually beneficial exchanges  in such areas as project management,  design engineering  for infrastructural development and marketing among  member countries.

* Examine ways of improving the export trade of developing countries in commodities,  semi-manufactures  and manufactures and of encouraging the adoption of  positive adjustment policies, especially by developed

countries, which will facilitate the redeployment of  industries on the basis of comparative advantage.

- Promote market promotion activities which aim at facilitating the expansion of intraregional trade.

Industrial Co-operation

29. Heads of Government recognised the importance  of mutual co-operation in the industrial development of  the region. They noted with satisfaction the establishment  of the Industrial Development Unit (IDU) within the  Commonwealth Secretariat and felt that it provided a  useful vehicle for industrial co-operation among member

countries. They felt that the Unit could play a positive  role in providing catalytic inputs relating to feasibility  studies, upgrading industries through technical, engineering  and managerial support and filling gaps impeding the

implementation of viable projects. They noted that the role  of the IDU was to provide expertise and services to complement  the activities of other international agencies.

30. Heads of Government expressed their appreciation  of the offers of assistance made by Australia and India in  the form of funds, experts, technology and other services  to support the IDU and facilitate successful implementation  of industrial projects in the region.

.  I

31. They acknowledged the need for making special   efforts for the industrial development of small island   developing countries in the region and for drawing up

special shcemes for this purpose. Such schemes should   be responsive to the perceptions and policies of the   individual countries themselves with regard to the course   of their industrial development.

32. Heads of Government noted that the Asian

Development Bank and the South Pacific Bureau for Economic   Co-operation would be undertaking an industrial survey to   identify projects to enable island countries to take   advantage of the South Pacific Regional Trade and Economic   Agreement and that the Government of Australia had offered

to provide a team leader.

33. With a view to providing a means of continuing

mutual co-operation in industrial development of the region,   and a continuing forum for the exchange of ideas among   member countries, Heads of Government decided to set up a   Working Group on Industry with the following Terms of   Reference:

(a) Examine and consider proposals for industrial co-operation   among member countries including: .

.  .  ./9

9 .

(i) Establishing and enhancing capabilities for industrial development and technical co-operation.   in regard to consultancy,  engineering design,  technological documentation,  technology transfer,  development of national standards and research

and development,

(ii) training of manpower and entrepreneurial  development and,

(iii) identification and implementation of specific  projects of industrial co-operation such as  resource surveys,  pre-investment studies,  development of energy sources,  and the establishment  .  of small-scale and large industrial ventures,

(b)  provide to the countries concerned its assessment of  these proposals:

(c ) interact with the IDU in the work of facilitating  industrial development in the region,  and

(d) undertake such other assignments as may be entrusted  to it by the Commonwealth Heads of Government Regional  Meeting.

34. It was decided that Papua New Guinea would act

as the convenor of the working group.

Energy

35. Heads of Government considered and endorsed the Report of the Consultative Group, on Energy. They welcomed  the.establishment of the Regional Renewable Energy Resources  Information System as a valuable contribution which,  inter

alia,  will assist in identifying problems caused by the  shortage of adequate information and,  in many instances,  the absence of sufficient numbers of adequately trained  personnel. They underlined the crucial character which the  question of energy had now assumed in the global scene. They .

stressed the importance given in the Report to the Development,  of Integrated Energy Systems to meet the needs of each country  on the basis of utilising local resources,  in particular those  of renewable energies. They agreed that the group should

intensify its activity in the period ahead and not only  continue to stress the issues identified in the Sydney  Communique,  but also examine new initiatives for the wider  utilisation of renewable energy technologies,  including

technology transfer on mutually beneficial terms. In this  regard they welcomed the suggestions made by India to make  available training facilities in Indian Institutions to  scientific and technical personnel from other countries,

to supply prototypes of devices for the utilisation of  renewable energies and to make available the services of  specialists in the fields covered by the Report.  They also  agreed that the scope of the Group's activities should be  widened to include certain aspects of conventional energy  as proposed in the Report of the Group. .

.  .  ./10

10.

36. Heads of Government took particular note of the

fact,  revealed in the Group's Report,  that a paucity of  data and a difficulty of access where data exist are  important handicaps to energy planning and technology  assessment,  particularly in the smaller countries. They

therefore welcomed the willingness of India and Australia  to support such resource and energy needs surveys as might  be requested.  They also referred to the need to provide  increased training and other technical assistance, including

the exchange of personnel,  in order to facilitate the  implementation of energy programmes geared to the needs of  the countries of the region. In this connection they  noted with satisfaction that the Governments of Papua New  Guinea and Australia had announced during the Meeting their  intention to co-sponsor an energy planning workshop in  Papua New Guinea later this year.

Agricultural Research and Development

37. Heads of Government noted that a number of

Commonwealth countries of the region had expertise and experience  in agricultural research and development which could profitably  be harnessed for wider collective benefit. They agreed that  with the prospect of an increasing imbalance between food

supplies and population growth and with overwhelming  dependence on agricultural products as major export earners in many countries of the region,  a greater co-operative  effort in this area would be both timely and beneficial..

38. Heads of Government considered a number of proposals put forward by the President of Bangladesh and,  as a consequence,  requested the Secretary-General to appoint an expert study  group (drawn from the countries of the region)  to examine and .

recommend a programme of action designed to establish  purposeful collaboration among countries of the region,  Â· increase and diversify agricultural production and  processing and alleviate rural poverty through agricultural  development,  including the development of fisheries. .

39. Heads of Government agreed that in implementing  their mandate,  the Expert Study Group should study and  make recommendations relating to:

(a) measures for an increased flow of information on  .agricultural research and development,  with the aim of facilitating the transfer and exchange of  technologies,  research management,  research

equipment and adaptive research, taking into account  the specific needs of each country:

(b) a framework for greater co-operation amongst national research institutions in the region,  including the . exchange of research scientists and other experts,

. .  . / I I

11.

(c) appropriate measures for the establishment of an  "Information Bank" based on evaluated expertise  in agricultural research and development and  related fields in countries of the region,

(d) joint projects by national institutes in appropriate  rural technologies,  including post harvest storage  and processing technology:

(e) regional co-operation in the protection of national  rights and the exploitation and development of fishery  resources in the new exclusive economic zones (EEZ).

40. It was agreed that full account should be taken by

the group of services and assistance available through  existing agencies,  institutions and bilateral aid. The  Study Group would submit its report to the Secretary-General  as early as possible. It was agreed that the-costs of the

individual experts appointed to the Study Group would be  met from within the region.

Illicit Drugs

41. Heads of Government reviewed the Report of the Working Group on Illicit Drugs which dealt with a serious  problem affecting humanity at large in a variety of ways.  They recognised that drug abuse on a pervasive scale

threatened the security,  stability and resilience of a  nation. They further noted that this was not merely a  social problem and that there was a clear link between  drug trafficking and other types of organised crime,

including illegal traffic in firearms,  which could pose a  serious security problem in some countries. They expressed  the hope that steps would be taken by the concerned  member countries for early adherence to the UN Conventions  of 1961 (as amended)  and 1971 so as to secure a uniform  basis for the harmonisation of national drug laws within

the region.  They reiterated the need to foster closer  co-operation and to explore the possibility of enacting  fresh legislation or amending the existing legislation  where necessary,  for the effective implementation of the  working group's recommendations within the framework of the

existing international and regional agencies. They agreed  that the group should be reconvened at least once a year.

Terrorism *

42. The Report of the Working Group on the important

subject of terrorism was reviewed. In endorsing the Report,  Heads of Government commended the degree of co-operation  which was evident from the interchange among officials. They agreed that regional member countries should take

appropriate action in the light of recommendations of the  Group and keep in close touch during forthcoming  deliberations on this subject in relevant international bodies.

Assistance for Small Island Developing States

43. Heads of Government commended the desire of Pacific Island countries for greater self-reliance through  increased mutual co-operation among themselves. They  welcomed their initiative for a Pacific Regional Advisory  Service proposed at the Honolulu Conference in March 1980,  through which they would assist each other in providing 1   for their need for specialist skills and other manpower  requirements.  The proposal for a Pacific Regional Advisory  Service was fully consistent both with the Commonwealth tradition  of mutual help and self reliance and with the United Nations  concept of increased technical co-operation amongst  developing island countries themselves.  Heads of Government  welcomed^ Australia's offer to finance and to assist in  regional consultations on the establishment of the proposed  Pacific Regional Advisory Service. .  .

Role of the Commonwealth Secretariat

44. Heads of Government expressed their appreciation  for the effective contribution being made to regional  co-operation by the Commonwealth Secretariat. They were  confident that the Secretariat would continue to be .   responsive to requests for assistance in the planning,  design and implementation of appropriate activities in  member countries of the region. To this end,  they

emphasised that it would be desirable for all CHOGRM  programmes to be developed in close collaboration with  the Secretariat and with the support of its professional  services in order to ensure maximum harmonisation witÃ¢ÂÂh  other relevant Commonwealth activities.

Funding

45. Heads of Government recognised that if the impetus of the programme for regional co-operation is to be maintained,  additional resources will be required by the Commonwealth  Secretariat and in particular the CFTC for the provision of  the additional services and technical assistance.  They  undertook to consider sympathetically,  in consultation with

the Secretariat,  the additional funding requirements of  specific activities. .  .

Co-operation with Other Countries and Organisations

46. Heads of Government expressed the view that regional co-operation should allow for co-operation with  non-Commonwealth countries and organisations in specific  activities where this is desirable.  They agreed that in  order to ensure a greater exchange of information for mutual  benefit,  the reports of the consultative and working

groups should be made available to relevant regional and  international organisations.

FOLLOW-UP ACTION

47. Heads of Government expressed their sincere .

appreciation to the CHOGRM Consultant,  Mr Koelmeyer, the Commonwealth Secretariat and the South Pacific Bureau  for Economic Co-operat jion,  for maintaining the momentum  towards greater co-operation and consultation which was  generated by their first meeting. In view of the increased

number, of areas which they had identified for expanding the  functional relationship between them,  they agreed on the  need to continue and strengthen the liaison facilities Ã¢ÂÂ  required to ensure appropriate follow-up action and  requested the Secretary-General,  in consultation with  member countries and subject to the availability of  resources,  to make available the necessary liaison  facilities.

APPRECIATION TO HOST GOVERNMENT

48. Heads of Government expressed appreciation for the excellent arrangements made for their Meeting by the  Indian Government and for the warm and friendly  hospitality they received from the Indian Government and  people. .

49. Heads of Government expressed satisfaction with  the progress made in th.eir regional initiatives since their  first meeting in Sydney in February 1978 and with the  contribution their regional co-operation has made to the  strengthening of their Commonwealth bonds and the Commonwealth

association as a whole. They asked the Chairman to convey  these sentiments to all other Commonwealth Heads of  Government.

Next Meeting

50. Heads of Government accepted with pleasure an invitation from the Prime Minister of Fiji to meet again  in Suva in 1982.
