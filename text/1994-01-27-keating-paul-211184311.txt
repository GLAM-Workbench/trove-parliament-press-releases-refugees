E&OE PROOF COPY

RM: PM, thanks for your time.

PM: It’s a pleasure, Ray.

RM: Have you had a chance to talk to Prince Charles?

PM: You mean since yesterday?

RM: Yes.

PM: No. But I had a very pleasant conversation with him the night   before, and we had a little bit of correspondence between us   yesterday morning, but I haven’t seen him since.

RM: You haven’t. Do you know whether he was concerned? He   certainly looked very calm, didn’t he?

PM: Oh, he’s a professional at this sort of thing. He was attending   functions like this when he was seven years of age. I think   he’s had more experience at these sorts of events than any of   us.

RM: But you can’t get experience with someone coming out of a   crowd with a gun?

PM: No, I know. But his relaxed demeanour - his control in the

circumstances -I think reflected the professional attitude he   has.

RM: The NSW Premier’s called for tighter security. Have you   personally called for that?

2

PM: No. I think one of the nice things about this country is that

people are accessible. I think the important thing to record   about this, is that it was not an assassination attempt - it was   a political demonstration. It’s unfair to Prince Charles, for   anyone to be reporting it as an assassination attempt, when it   wasn’t. It’s a serious thing for somebody to be saying that

somebody is out to assassinate you. This was not true, and I   think that therefore the Prince’s own relaxed demeanour   reflected how he wished the episode to be viewed.

RM: Yes, he wouldn’t have known at the time though, would he?   Suddenly someone comes out of a crowd with what looks like   a gun?

PM: Oh sure, absolutely.

RM: Similarly, Premier Fahey and Ian Kiernan were quick out of   the blocks and showed extraordinary reactions?

PM: Absolutely. John’s had experience on the football field and   Ian’s an all-round sportsman, and quick reflexes and I think   everyone would have been very, very proud of their quick   response.

RM: Britain, America - around the world that footage obviously is   in the news tonight. Should we be embarrassed?

PM: I think we must reflect upon this. We are all embarrassed   whenever any good friend of Australia - any person such as   this - is affronted in this way. Prince Charles is a good friend   of this country and he should be treated with the respect and   dignity that a good friend deserves.

RM: What about the alleged reason for the demonstration?   Should we be embarrassed about our treatment of

Cambodian refugees?

PM: Well, we’ve got processes in place to deal with refugee

assessment. It’s not a simple issue for Australia or any

country, and we’ve been working through these legal

processes to try and resolve all these problems.

RM: Children, women, men in jails, effectively for four years?

PM: I know they’re   and finalised.

low, and we are trying to get them resolved

RM: Now the speech itself the Prince gave yesterday, last night.   Some papers say that Prince Charles gave his tacit blessing   to the republican movement. Is that the way you read it?

PM: What he said I think was, or directly said - look, this is a

matter for Australians. This is a matter for you people, but   personally I think this debate is a sign of a mature and

confident country. In other words, personally I think you’re   able to handle this debate, and it’s a good thing you are.

RM: But republicans, he said, may be right?

PM: Well, I don’t think I’m entitled to say that he’s saying Australia should   be a republic. I think he has said to us have your own debate. As a

member of the Royal Family, we will accept a decision by the

Australian people, and frankly, he said, it shows a sign of a mature and   confident country. I mean he is giving us a wink and a nod to carry on   with this debate.

RM: You know that’s going to be headline tomorrow? PM says   Prince Charles gives us a wink and a nod?

PM: Not for a Republic, but to have the debate. But he’s certainly   not giving us a wink and a nod - not to move this way.

RM: I’m just looking at your speech tonight, shortly in Melbourne.   You have been accused over the last couple of years by

some of bashing the poms over the Singapore evacuation   and Gallipoli and things like that, and yet in this speech you   seem to be out there touting for British business.

PM: There is a really good modern linkage with Britain of the kind   we should have. What I can’t stand is this tugging the

forelock business.

RM: Just before we leave Britain, can I just ask: there was a report   on the weekend papers that Princess Diana

would like to

come to Australia. As the mother of a future King would she   officially be welcomed?

PM: I have never seen any request from her, Ray, and naturally   we would discuss that. But again, most people who want to   come to Australia are welcome, that would include Princess   Diana.

RM: Can we leave the Brits there for a moment? We will come

back and talk about other things with Mr Keating in just a

moment.

Let’s turn to the economy it has been a good year. The indicators are

very good for this, can we let the good times roll?

Yes, but I said yesterday, and I think it is worth repeating, this can’t be   a top end of town recovery.

What does that mean?

We don’t want to see . . . into the stock market and people playing paper   assets, or throwing paper assets around.

Like the high fliers of the ’80s.

It has got to spread out into plant and equipment investment and into   employment.

Can you officially say the recession is behind us?

The recession is definitely behind us.

No question about that. Are you worried about interest rates going up?

The recession is way behind us, accept that we have still got the carry   over in long term unemployment which the Government is devoting   itself to now in these next three months.

So that becomes a priority suddenly does it?

It becomes a priority from a social justice point of view and a national   economic efficiency point of view.

RM: What can you do about that? There is almost a million out of   work.

PM:

RM:

PM:

Well there is about 400,000 who have been out of work for one year or   more. They’re the problem. The Government has got to try and get   them back into the swim as well as get aggregate employment going.   So it’s the short-term unemployed

and the long-term unemployed.

Someone sitting here watching this tonight and says - Keating would   say the recession is over but I haven’t had a job for a year and a half   and I’m not going to get one.

Well that is my point. There is a lag there. I think the word, Ray, I

used it a lot with One Nation and in 1992 and in 1993, and that is

inclusion. This has to be an inclusive society. That we all move along   together. And if someone does drop back, we bring them up. And not   let them slip away into an underclass.

RM: Yeah, but clearly from this speech

about the Australian economy?   tonight, you are very optimistic

PM: I think we have never faced in the last

This is strong growth with very low inflation,   25 years, a period quite like this.

RM: Is it a good time to invest in piggeries?

PM: Well it is a good time to invest in Australia’s comparative advantage.   One Australia’s great comparative advantages is food and we should   all be investing in things which add value, employ people and

hopefully it will lead to exports.

RM: PM, how about sandwich shops?

PM: Well, I think Ministers are entitled to invest in things, but they also

have to be responsible for them.

RM:

Alright, was Allan Griffith’s responsible with his sandwich shop?

Yes, if you have an investment you have to be responsible for, in

political terms.

Can you tell us tonight who the new Minister is?

No, I haven’t decided that yet, Ray.

Would you think, I mean, Laurie Brereton, Simon Crean, Graham   Richardson, Peter Cook are the names. Is that a fair guess?

Well each one of those would be a competent industry Minister.

Does Mr Griffith, at this stage, have a political career?

Absolutely. He is still a Federal member of Parliament, and also while   he will not be Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional

Development he will still have a right to recontest a position in the

ministry.

I know you can’t speak about it, so I won’t push it further, but there are   reports in the press that Mr Griffith knew about these alleged Labor   Party checks and about the $941 .OO six weeks before he told you.

Well I am not aware of it. The first, you asked me earlier, the first I

knew of any of this matter was last Friday evening.

Do you think, if that’s the case, should you have been told six weeks   ago if he knew?

PM:

RM:

Well that’s a matter for him, and in the end when all this comes out in   the wash, and let’s not presume all these things are right, then we can   make judgements about that.

What do you think about Bronwyn Bishops line that you can’t run the   industry portfolio if you can’t run a sandwich shop?

Well I think the more important line is what contribution have the

Liberals got to make to modern Australia. I mean here they are, they   have opposed everything last year, they tried to knock the Budget   over, they have opposed Mabo for no reason other than to oppose it.   They start the new year without an economic policy, I mean they are in

a terrible situation. You have got Dr Hewson on the one hand, and   now Senator Bishop on the other. It seems to me, Ray, it is a choice   between a vacuum and a lot of hot air. I mean Senator Bishop has no   policy structure in her head.

Do you have any fears at all about Bronwyn Bishop and the bull ring,   or bull pit of the House of Reps?

As far as I am concerned, as they put them up we deal with them. It

was Andrew Peacock, then it was John Howard, then it was Andrew   Peacock, then it is John Hewson. Whoever is next we will be ready   and waiting for them.

Does your crystal ball say she is going to be leader before the year is   out?

Well she is going to keep on trying, even if the Party doesn’t give her   the job. But if they do give her the job they know in their heart of

hearts that there is no structure there.

All right, tough question now, what’s it like to be 50?

Well all those Peter Pan notions go right out of your mind. I mean I

belonged to that baby boomer generation which believed it was never   going to grow old.

Do you feel old?

I don’t feel old, but I know I am getting older, much older, and I am sure   there is no generation that has resisted aging more than mine. And   you see them, and they are still out there, but there ranks are thinning   and they are fattening up, and their hair is thinning, as mine is. So the   years go on.

Do you qualify as a dear old thing as you have called some   members of the Labor Party, are you now a dear old thing?   of the older

PM: Not quite, not quite, there is some cross over point, it has probably got

a six in front of it.

RM: You have had your real holiday, the break. What d   read a book, or just play old rock and roll records?   id you do? Did you

PM: We went to the beach, we went sailing quite a bit, I did a bit of reading,   a bit of music. I went to a bit of theatre, so, I have had a couple of

weeks of sun and culture.

RM: Did you play any Tom Jones records to loud for Anita?

PM: Well we had Billy Joel, the kids like Billy Joel and so do I. We meet at

Billy Joel. Everything sort of after him I tend to drop off. And of course   when the kids are around they monopolise all the audio visual

equipment as it is called.

RM: PM, thank you for your time.

PM: Thank you, Ray.
