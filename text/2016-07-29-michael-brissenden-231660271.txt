MICHAEL BRISSENDEN:

The Attorney-General George Brandis joins me now here in our Parliament House studio in Canberra.  Senator Brandis, good morning.

ATTORNEY-GENERAL:

Good morning Michael.

MICHAEL BRISSENDEN:

Did you consult with any Aboriginal groups about the terms of reference? If not, why not?

ATTORNEY-GENERAL:



As a matter of fact I did. I consulted Mick Gooda, who is the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander  Social Justice Commissioner, and I know the Prime Minister consulted Warren Mundine, to ask for  their feedback about the terms of reference. These are arguably the two most prominent Indigenous  spokespeople in Australia and they were consulted. As well, quite a number of Indigenous justice  groups approached my office, either by telephone or in writing, and their views were also taken into  account in preparing the terms of reference.

MICHAEL BRISSENDEN:

And were they specifically Northern Territory groups?

ATTORNEY-GENERAL:

Most of them were yes.

MICHAEL BRISSENDEN:

It seems that some people, some Aboriginal people though, as you heard, feel that there hasn’t been  correct process here or they hadn’t been involved.

ATTORNEY-GENERAL:

We wanted to act swiftly and decisively, and frankly I’m more interested in the Royal Commission  getting to the bottom of the problem and coming up with actionable answers to the identified  problems than having a debate about process. The terms of reference of the Royal Commission are  comprehensive, but they are also focussed and the fact that we didn’t hold some endless public  seminar with any number of groups to talk about what should be in the terms of reference is hardly the  point. The test of this Royal Commission is whether or not it will come up with actionable answers to  identified problems and I believe it will.

MICHAEL BRISSENDEN:

One of the other criticisms that’s already come out, as I’m sure you are well aware, is that the Chief  Minister Adam Giles is so closely involved. Given his previous comments where he said if he was  Corrections Minister he would build a big concrete hole and put all the bad criminals in there, might  even break UN conventions on the rights of the prisoner. That doesn’t sound like someone who wants  to stamp out abuse, does it?

ATTORNEY-GENERAL:

Well Mr Giles’s contribution to this process has been exemplary. As he said, he was in fact the first  one who said there should be a Royal Commission. This is a Chief Minister saying there should be a  Royal Commission into his own Government and previous Labor Governments in the Northern  Territory. I found Mr Giles extremely cooperative. In fact, the terms of reference are somewhat  broader than they would otherwise have been as a result of Mr Giles contribution. Mr Giles isn’t  going to be conducting the Royal Commission any more than I am going to be. It’s going to be  conducted by an independent and esteemed Royal Commissioner who will have complete freedom of  action, absolute independence but subject to comprehensive terms of reference.

MICHAEL BRISSENDEN:

But is it right that the Northern Territory Government has such an involvement in setting up the terms  of reference? Yesterday on this program the President of the Australian Bar Association Patrick  O’Sullivan QC said that they shouldn’t be involved.

ATTORNEY-GENERAL:

Well I don’t agree at all. In fact when one looks at the history of Royal Commissions in this country  when there are systemic abuses within a particular jurisdiction, usually it’s been that jurisdiction alone  that has set up the Royal Commission. We think of the WA Inc Royal Commission set up by the  Western Australian Government. My mind goes back to the Fitzgerald Inquiry in Queensland, set up  by the Queensland Government. The only slightly unusual feature of this is that the Commonwealth is  involved at all but because the Prime Minister decided that this was an issue of national concern and  decided to take national leadership he involved the Commonwealth in a joint endeavour with the  Northern Territory.

MICHAEL BRISSENDEN:

And who recommended Brian Martin? Was it the Northern Territory Government?

ATTORNEY-GENERAL:

It was not the Northern Territory Government. I consulted my colleagues. We considered a number of  options. We were looking for a retired judge. I think retired superior court judges are always good for  these jobs as Royal Commissioners because they have got the professional skill and experience to  conduct forensic proceedings and their independence and integrity can’t be disputed.

MICHAEL BRISSENDEN:

Again, some Aboriginal groups in the Northern Territory have expressed concern about his  appointment. They say they don’t have confidence in him because as Chief Justice of the Northern  Territory he was at the centre of the justice system and he sentenced some juveniles himself.

ATTORNEY-GENERAL:

Well just because he may have sentenced juveniles doesn’t mean that he is not independent. Brian  Martin is a man who has been a Supreme Court Judge in not one, but three Australian jurisdictions -   he was the Chief Justice of the Northern Territory, as a Judge of the Supreme Court of South Australia  and as an acting judge of the Supreme Court of Western Australia. Any suggestion that he is not  independent, any suggestion that he is not suitable for a task of this kind is very foolish.

MICHAEL BRISSENDEN:

Okay, but those suggestions are out there. I guess this is really about perceptions too, isn’t it?

ATTORNEY-GENERAL:

I have no doubt at all that Justice Martin’s conduct of this Royal Commission will demonstrate the  wisdom of the Government’s choice of him as Royal Commissioner.

MICHAEL BRISSENDEN:

Are you expecting the Commission to recommend the laying of criminal charges?

ATTORNEY-GENERAL:

Well that’s one of the terms of reference. One of its terms of reference, term of reference ‘C’, is to  look at whether any treatment of people within the youth detention system in the Northern Territory  may amount to a breach of a law of the Commonwealth or a law of the Northern Territory, so it’s  certainly open to the Royal Commissioner to turn his mind to that issue, yes.

MICHAEL BRISSENDEN:

Is it the case, as it’s been reported this morning, that because of a change in the law in 2014,  introduced by the Giles Government, prison guards have been given immunity from prosecution after  six months of the incident occurring? So if that is the case, if…

ATTORNEY-GENERAL:

Well that is a matter within the Northern Territory legal system. This Royal Commission has been set  up to identify and get to the bottom of a problem which was exposed by Four Corners and we’ve  given it the comprehensive terms of reference to enable it to do that without fetter.

MICHAEL BRISSENDEN:

But if it does recommend charges and they can’t be laid….

ATTORNEY-GENERAL:

That is a matter for…I think we are getting way ahead of ourselves Michael. If that’s the case that  would be a matter for the prosecution authorities of the Northern Territory in years to come.

MICHAEL BRISSENDEN:

Just finally, are you comfortable that more than 30 youths held at Don Dale have now been moved to  the Wickham Point Detention Centre which, as I understand it, held asylum seekers before its closure?

ATTORNEY-GENERAL:

I’m not going to comment on internal arrangements within the Northern Territory. My role here has  been to prepare, in consultation with appropriate people, terms of reference that will meet an  identified need. The Government has acted swiftly and decisively and I’m confident that by  appointing Justice Martin as the Royal Commissioner within less than 72 hours of the airing of the  Four Corners report we will get real outcomes to what is obviously a serious problem.

MICHAEL BRISSENDEN:

I guess the point is that the serious problem might continue for some of those children if they are put  in a place where the Human Rights Commission has called completely inappropriate for children.

ATTORNEY-GENERAL:

We don’t run the Northern Territory youth detention system but what we have done is moved swiftly  and decisively to get to the bottom of what is obviously a serious problem within it.

MICHAEL BRISSENDEN:

And compensation generally? Clearly there are some who are looking for compensation. This is  outside, obviously the Royal Commission process, but that will go ahead, won’t it?

ATTORNEY-GENERAL:

Justice Martin was asked that at the press conference yesterday and he was of the view that the terms  of reference of the Royal Commission were comprehensive enough for him to consider that issue as  well.

MICHAEL BRISSENDEN:

Okay. George Brandis, thank you very much for joining us.

ATTORNEY-GENERAL:

Thank you, Michael.
