Coastwatch detects more boat people

A group of 21 suspected illegal arrivals are being transported today to the mainland from Ashmore Islands, the Minister for Justice and Customs, Senator Amanda Vanstone, said today.

The boat people, all adult males, arrived at Ashmore on an Indonesian-style fishing vessel.

Senator Vanstone said the peopleâ€™s arrival had been detected and monitored late Monday by a Coastwatch Dash-8 aircraft flying on a regular surveillance mission off north-western Australia.

Coastwatch immediately began co-ordination of vessels to transport the people back to the mainland. In response the Navy patrol boat HMAS Launceston and the Customs vessel ACV Botany Bay, arrived at Ashmore, late yesterday.

The boat people will be interviewed by officials from the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs.
