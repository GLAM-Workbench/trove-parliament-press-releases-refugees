DEPARTMENT OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS

NEWS RELEASE NO. M/46 2 June 3972

EXTRACTS FROM SPEECH GIVEN BY MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS, MR NIGEL BOWEN,   AT DINNER GIVEN IN HIS HONOUR BY THE INDIAN FOREIGN MINISTER ON 31 MAY 1972

"In the history of Australian/Indian relations there is, I

believe, a good record of mutual understanding. This, on our part, is Â·  Ã¢ÂÂ

based on a conscious acceptance by Australians of the importance of their

relations with India, It is backed by a widespread and sympathetic interest

by our people in your country. On the working level, we have easy and

informal consultations continuously between our officials and an annual

meeting in each others countryÃ¢ÂÂ -  At the ministerial level we make periodic

personal contacts. Your Prime Minister, Mrs Gandhi, has honoured Australia

with a visit. Last year our Prime Minister had most useful conversations '

with her in Washington, I recall too the somewhat hurried but frank and

useful discussion which I had with you, Mr Minister in New York last year.

This has been followed by the less hurried and very useful talks which we

have had yesterday and again today.

Our two countries are, of course, vastly different in the size

of their populations, in their cultural backgrounds and in their history.

But we have a common acceptance of parliamentary democracy. I attended

your question time yesterday and found it not unlike our own. We have a

common acceptance of the importance of the role of law we share a common

language. And finally to some extent at least we have some geography in

common.

. . . / 2 ;

.  Our mutual trade could, I believe, be expanded. It is

substantial enough, but it is not yet a highly significant part of

either country's total trade. I am hopeful that it will grow. Maybe

Australia's participation in the Third Asian International Trade Fair in

New Delhi later this year will throw new light on mutual trade opportunities.

We have gained a habit of cooperation through economic aid projects under

the Colombo Plan. These projects are all practical and they are all

joint efforts. In addition to their usefulness, they should be seen as a

token of the involvement of the people of Australia in the welfare of the

Indian people. .

Australians have followed with interest your success in

expanding food production through scientific agriculture and in diversifying

your exports. We believe our joint aid projects fit in to your plans. The

modern bakeries which have been established in a number of cities throughout

India have helped to raise the quantity and quality of bread available to

the people. The Australian Government will consider plans for expanding

these bakeries. The same applied to our joint efforts under the Indo-

Australian Sheep Breeding Scheme. This has been a success. We would like

to build on it. The Australian Government is prepared also to see whether

we can apply our experience in sheep breeding to similar joint programmes

for cattle breeding and animal husbandry in India, linked to our current

programme for the supply of cattle.

.  We are trying to exercise a responsible role within the limit

of our capacities. We are doing this particularly within the Asian and

Pacific region. It was in that spirit that the Australian Government and

people viewed what happened last year in the sub-continent. We were kept

well-informed of the way in which the tragic events unfolded here both from

our own sources and through a personal visit by Mr S.S. Ray, then your

Education Minister. We understood the force of nationalism which was

involved. We understood also the weight of millions of refugees on an

already over-burdened neighbouring country, and the vast humanitarian

problems which they brought. The people of Australia and their Government

moved quickly to help to alleviate their needs.

The Government also did what it could during the course of

last year to promote a peaceful settlement. Early this year, we decided

to take the initiative to recognise Bangladesh ahead of many other countries.

I have recently come from this new and important Commonwealth country - with

which we hope to establish a close relationship.

The next step on the sub-continent is to achieve a lasting

settlement. We appreciate that the possible role for any outside party is

limited and that the parties primarily concerned must resolve their outstanding

differences. We shall watch with sympathetic understanding and with hope the

efforts which are being made to bring that about. In looking ahead to the

future of the sub-continent, we acknowledge that the power balance has

changed and that India is clearly pre-eminent by virtue of its population,

its economic strength and its military capacity.

It is in the South East Asian area that Australia is most

directly interested. On the mainland, there remains the tragic problem of

the unresolved armed conflict in Indo-China. We believe that any settlement

there, to be satisfactory, must be based on the principle that all countries

sind peoples, no matter how small, should be free to determine their own

governments and ways of life, free from aggression from outside either direct

or indirect. The self-reliance and cooperation and the greater pov/ers

outside the region must respect their efforts.

The Australian Government welcomed the initiative of the

Association of South East Asian Nations last November in seeking to apply

on a regional basis, some broader principles affecting peace security and

stability. There will be practical difficulties in working for a zone of

peace freedom and neutrality as a long-term solution but this goal is

certainly consistent with Australian policies. Â·

.  We subscribe also to the ideal that the Indian Ocean region

should be a zone of peace, although we have expressed doubts as to whether .

proposals put forward so far to that end have been either practical or

realistic or acceptable to many of the states vitally concerned. Australia

approaches this problem as a country one-third of whose coastline faces the

Indian Ocean. We therefore have a special interest in what happens there.

Our hopes are that quantitative naval competition in the Indian Ocean may

be avoided.

To all of these problems the Australian Government brings its

own independent assessment. For obvious reasons we concentrate our efforts

primarily in the Asian and. Pacific area. It is here that Australia and

India are faced with particular challenges and dangers. It is here that

we believe we have many interests in common. There is a need for the great

powers to come to a balance of their interests and this balance must, we

believe, be based on mutual respect for different ideologies, interests

-  5  -

and policies. It is here also that it should be ensured that the wishes

of the countries of the region are respected.

Australia seeks to play a helpful role in two ways, first, by

assisting its neighbours to advance their own economic prosperity and,

secondly, by contributing, where it can do so, to the security and

stability of the area. This second point does not mean we are against

change. It does mean that in general we are against change by violent

means.

We believe that in these respects, India has a special

importance. We do not pretend for a moment that our two countries agree

on all aspects of foreign policy. But we are convinced that our common

interests are more important than our differences. The need of both our

countries is for peace for for time for the development of our resources

for the benefit of our peoples. We each have an exciting future before us.

In Australia we believe that we are on the threshold of even greater

progress and development in the years ahead. Our secondary industry, our

mining industry and other sectors of the economy are growing at a significant

rate and we believe still have many untapped resources. We look to the

future with hope and high expectations.

We believe India's future is equally exciting. As your

economy develops and a greater range of your human and material sources

are employed for the advancement of your people, the future has much to

offer. Australia has watched this growth and development with great interest

and we are confident, as you are, that it augurs well for both our futures.

Australia will do all that it can to build on our close and

friendly relationship.  u
