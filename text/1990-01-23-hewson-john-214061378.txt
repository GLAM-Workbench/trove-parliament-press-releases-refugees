TRANSCRIPT OF PRESS CONFERENCE

CANBERRA, 23 JANUARY 1990

Hewson: Good Afternoon Ladies & Gentlemen. I can feel an election coming on. Consistent with the pattern of the  last two Federal Elections in '84 and '87, three to four  months before the election the Government starts to

lower interest rates and you have a repeat of that  pattern on this occasion suggesting an election I guess  sometime in April or May. I, like most Australians who  have been struggling under high interest rates and small  businesses, families and so on, I welcome any reduction

in interest rates that is genuine and that is  sustainable. I have some concern on this occasion that  the Treasurer may be forcing the pace in terms of  interest rate reduction in the sense that he hasn't  changed policy in a direction which would validate and

sustain lower interest rates. I think in doing that if  he does push the pace he does risk an A$ crisis because  the risks have probably never been greater than they are  at the present time in a sense that world interest rates  are now rising, commodity prices have come off quite

significantly and there's mounting evidence that growth  in the United States is slowing faster than expected. We would urge the Government to do what we've been  saying now for some months and that is to shift policy

along the lines outlined in detail in our Economic  Action Plan that would bring about lower and sustainably  lower interest rates.

Jrnlst: Would you say the 1.5% drop in the Australian dollar today precedes this crisis you're talking of, I mean,  has it already arrived?

Hewson:

The market's made a judgement on what they've observed  today. I'm not sure where the currency has finished. I  know it came off a bit over a cent but the currency has  obviously been sustained in part by the level of

interest rates but it's up to the market to make  judgements about those things. All I'm saying is what  I've been saying for months and that is that the risks

are there and, indeed, I think so far this year there's  been a more realistic assessment of the nature of the  risks and the size of the risks in the international  economy.

In your Economic Action Plan ..(inaudible)., fiscal  policy by one cent so ..(inaudible)..

We bring about a substantially smaller public sector. We bring about a substantial capacity to pay off debt  with the proceeds of our privatisation policy and we  have outlined a full detailed list of other measures  which would be essential, I believe, to turning our

balance of payments around in a sustainable way bringing  debt under control and, importantly, bringing inflation  under control which is the key to sustainably lower  interest rates.

But all ..(inaudible) .. are going to have three years,  they're not going to come in the first year.

We can start, and part of what we're doing this week is  working on the transition to Government. We can start  virtually from day one and as we start to implement  those decisions and are seen to do so there will be a

confidence factor in financial markets apart from  anything else. Each of the policies takes a different  period of time, its true, to take its effect.

So how sure do ..(inaudible).. think is too early ..

No, I didn't say that. I just said that I am concerned  that reductions are unsustainable. The interest rates  will come off as we have been saying this year as the  economy slows down but there has been mixed evidence if

you like about whether the economy has really slowed  down or how much it slowed down. Obviously, that is a

3

Hewson:

judgemental thing and that judgement has been made by  the Government on this occasion. Even if you start  interest rates on a downward course as the economy  slows, you want to be able to sustain them there and  what is the option that the Treasurer has in mind from

now on? Is he going to keep the economy permanently  sedated because that's the only way in which he's  brought interest rates off that peak? Or is he simply  going to put interest rates back up if he manages to get  re-elected because he offers no policy shift and no  policy validation for lower interest rates.

Should he have waited until next week for the CPI and  the BOP?

On his own criteria, and this is another element of the  decision today, for a large part of last year he was  saying that he needed unambiguous evidence that demand  was slowing and the balance of payments was improving  before he'd consider easing policy. On his evidence

given today he refers only to the easing in demand of  which there is some evidence and which both he and the  Governor refer to as being in prospect, he seems to have  forgotten the balance of payments. Equally, the

Governor of the Reserve Bank in a speech at the end of  November warned that you needed to have trends in  employment, in imports, in wages and prices in the right  direction otherwise an easing of monetary policy could  prove to be premature and undo what he saw as some of

the benefits of the policy that is being pursued. Now  in both cases, against their own criteria, they've moved  somewhat earlier than that criteria would have  suggested. That's all I'm saying.

If you were Treasurer now you would not have allowed  this fall at this ..(inaudible)..

We wouldn't be the position that he's in, in the sense  that we would have been for some time - however long  we'd been in Government - taking the decisions I've  outlined which would have had interest rates in a

downward direction sustainably. You can't hang me by  his mistakes.

If you were dealing with current circumstances though  would you judge the economy ..

Hewson:

If we came into Government today and this decision  hadn't been taken we would immediately have embarked on  our Economic Action Plan which may have brought a shortÂ­ term favourable reaction as I've been saying in

financial markets. From there on the effect of those  policies would have created the circumstances in which  interest rates could come off and continue on down if  you like and be kept down.

What if Bernie Fraser got on the 'phone to you and said  he thinks it was time for interest rates to ease a bit?

It's an interesting question you raise implicitly as to  how this decision was taken. I assume Bernie Fraser  rang up and said it was time to ease. It's an input  into the policy decision that would need to be made. In  our view Bernie would be independent, Bernie would be  running monetary policy in the medium term apolitical  way and that question would have much less significance

under us than it does under them.

Just how independent do you think Bernie Fraser was in  making the decision?

I can't judge that. You can look at the facts. The  board meeting was somewhat earlier than it was planned.  Mr Keating introduced his remarks today by saying ”..  the Governor has eased monetary policy" and "we", he

said, "have judged", or whatever the words were, "that  demand has sufficiently eased" and he referred in his  press conference on a number of occasions to the very  mature relationship that has existed between the

Government and the Reserve Bank over the last seven  years. So you make your own judgement as to who did  what and who led who and who made what decisions.

Jrnlst: When will the election be?

Jrnlst:

Hewson:

Jrnlst:

I believe that, on present indications, somewhere around  the 7th April or maybe as late as May. On the track  record, if you're using today's decision as a guide, add  three to four months onto today's date and you get late  April, early May consistent with both '84 and '87.

How should the banks react, particularly ..(inaudible)..

It's not for me to say how the banks should react. The  banks will obviously make their own decisions about  market circumstances and retail and other interest  rates. What we have observed in the financial markets

of recent days is that professional market interest  rates - which are in effect the cost of funds to banks -  have gone up by 6 or 7 per cent, I suppose, since they  started tightening policy in April of '88. Other

interest rates like housing interest rates have probably  gone up 3 to 3 1/2 per cent so only about half as much

as professional market rates have gone up. That would  suggest if the banks are left unconstrained that they  may be in no hurry to lower housing interest rates or  they may only lower them marginally against what they  would probably argue has been a substantial cost of

funds disadvantage over the last couple of years. But I  stress, it's not for me to say, it's not for me to make  that judgement, it's for them to make that judgement  based on their assessment hopefully of commercial

realities.

Dr Hewson on a separate issue could you tell us when you  expect to release your health policy?

No, I won't tell you that. Mr Shack will tell you that.  I think it's a good policy that Andrew introduced that  Shadow Ministers stick to their own areas and I  understand the consequences of not sticking to my area

so you'll have to ask Mr Shack.

We don't want you to tell us what's in it, we just want  you as Shadow Treasurer to tell us when it's going to be  released.

Hewson: Mr Shack will tell you when it's going to be released.

Hewson:

As a result of today's decision do you feel that the  strategy that the Opposition wants to pursue in saying a  vote for Hawke is a vote for Keating should now be  shelved?

I don't think that Mr Keating's image and I'm not  accepting that that's our strategy, I've read the story,  I wondered who floated the story - Hawke, Keating or  somebody else but all I'd say is that we won't change  our strategy and I don't think today's decision will  recover for the Treasurer all the lost ground that he  has suffered in terms of his credibility in economic  management. I think that's shot. Permanently.

Question inaudible.

I want to be popular in one sense and that is that I  want history to judge me as having done what I said I  would do and having turned this place around. That's  it. We're going to fix the economy and that's what I  want to be remembered for. I would shy away in view of

the experience of others from being the world's greatest  treasurer.

Do you think the economy can afford the proposed wage  tax deal that is being formulated at the moment?

Well, I don't know what that deal is and I have heard  the comments made by the Treasurer today where he has in  effect", I think, disputed at least one element of that  deal which is the request or whatever it is for a return  to full indexation. But what I'd say to you is that you

have to have some basic principles, and the Government  would have to pursue some basic principles, in relation  to that deal.  Most importantly, that any increases in  expenditure in the name of the social wage must be fully

funded and those details must be given just like we did  and we were forced to do in relation to our Economic  Action Plan. Any increase in wages must be validated on  the basis of genuine increases in productivity. As far

as the issue of full indexation goes it would be the  worst time in my view to contemplate a return to full  indexation when the risks are as great as they are both  in the international and the domestic economy and, of

7

Hewson:

course, where there is the possibility as we. saw today  of some downward pressure on the currency. The last  thing this country can afford is to go into another  devaluation price wage spiral which could readily ensue

in such circumstances.

Would you like to see ..(rest of question inaudible)..

What I'd like to see in terms of wages is a movement to  enterprise based bargaining where productivity is the  principle basis for wage determination. In terms of  what the Treasurer does I think he should bring down a  major economic statement in which he details a

significant shift in policies that would sustain the  lower interest rates that he started to create today. I  want to see lower interest rates but I want to see them  genuinely lower and I want to see them sustainably

lower. That will only come about if there are  significant shifts in the Government's overall stance of  macro and micro policies. Just look back at the last  two elections. I referred to the way they came down

beginning three to four months before each of the last  two elections. Within 12 months of each of the last two  elections the interest rates were on their way back up.  In '84 it was February/March '85 that they started going  back. In the '87 election it was about April of '88

that they started to go back up and they hit  significantly higher levels in each case. So, their  record speaks for itself. You don't just want interest  rates that come down for a limited period of time. You  want them to be brought down and kept down and the only  way you're going to do that is really bring inflation

under control, start to stabilise our debt and balance  of payments situation, turning it around and in those  circumstances you need a substantial shift in policy. And that's what he should do. He should do that as a  matter of urgency. Major economic statement setting out

that sort of detail.

Question inaudible.

We've put down the details of our Economic Action Plan  relative to the figuring that we have which was given to  us on the basis of the Government's last budget. In  each case we've put our expenditure and tax decisions  relative to that base and we came down with a

significantly larger surplus in that Economic Action  Plan both as a result of net expenditure cutting and as

8

Jrnlsts

Hewson:

Jrnlst:

Hewson:

a result of the proceeds of our privatisation. So in  those terms we foreshadowed a larger surplus on the  numbers that we put out and so far we haven't deviated  from those numbers at all. If we do we've said we will

fully fund any increases in expenditure between now and  the election or we'll tell you in effect where the  money's coming from. So we stand by the position we put  down earlier.

Is that a hint that there might be some spending cuts  attached to the health policy ..(inaudible)..

No, it's not a hint about health or anything else, it's  just a statement. But if we do anything we'll tell you  where the money's coming from. There might be a  temptation to do one or two things in the lead up to the  election and if we do we'll tell you where the money's

coming from. That's all I'm saying.

..(inaudible) marginal increase in surplus and  ..(inaudible)., proposing to hand back .. rest of  question inaudible.

You've been too swayed by this analogy of Keating's that  we ran up to the top of the Empire State Building and  just put another brick on the top. The world is quite  different. The Empire State Building is now nowhere

near the largest building in the world. There is a  different world out there if I can us that term and  that's what we're going to build. And that does involve  a substantially smaller public sector than this

Government. It does require us to restrain expenditure,  not only in the first year which is what we detailed in  the Economic Action Plan but because of the commitment  to lower inflation, because of the commitment to hand  back bracket creep and because of the commitment to

restructure the personal income tax scales towards a two  tier tax system we will have to sustain expenditure  restraint over the life of the first Peacock Government.   Come back in three years' time and see how much

significantly smaller the public sector is relative to  where it would have been under this Government which  has, despite the rhetoric, been on an increasing  expenditure hit for some time principally in the name of

the social wage. You are looking at two substantially  different attitudes to fiscal policy. You should'nt  forget that the bulk of the restraint that the  Government claims in expenditure, if you just look at

9

Jrnlst:

Hewson:

expenditure reductions in real terms, the bulk of that  has come from cuts and payments to the States, asset  sales, savings in public sector debt interests,  accelerating the repayment of loans by various bodies  and so on. Not too many, and virtually I don't think  any program cuts and no specific sizeable cuts in

individual line items in the budget. We are really  going to take the restraint of Government expenditure  one stage further if you like in actually addressing  specific programs and access to specific programs. In  that sense our decision on unemployment benefits was a

..(inaudible)., decision and it clearly gives you an  indication of the type of decision which we think is  important where you have to effectively target that  expenditure, or more effectively target that  expenditure. That will give you, over a three year  period, a substantially different structure and size of  public sector and therefore impact of fiscal policy than  would be the case under a Government which is

consistently panicking now and has a tendency to spend  more rather than less. And while you worry about a few  things we might ..(inaudible).. about the few things we  might do between now and the election why don't you ask

Mr Hawke how he funded the $500-600 million of increased  expenditure just since the budget. It's been a  substantial increase in Government expenditure that we  know about and probably more that we haven't been given  a full account of and it's all been unfunded to date.

Does the Economic Action Plan ..(inaudible)., the first  year of ..(inaudible).. Government and do you  ..(inaudible)., that there will be a ..(inaudible).,  fiscal policy in the last two years or so ..(rest of

question inaudible)..

What I've said is there will be more spending cuts  because there will be sustained fiscal policy restraint  under the commitments that I listed. Don't hold me to  particular numbers. You'll have to come back in each

episode of the budget over each of those three years.   But we're serious about cutting back on the size of the  public sector and w e 've put commitments on ourselves  which will ensure that we do.

Jrnlst: How can this bring a sustainable fall in interest rates?

10

Hewson: Sustainable falls in interests rates basically come from getting inflation under control and keeping it under  control. Here we have an easing of policy, a question  was asked earlier, an easing of policy this week before  we get the CPI number for the last quarter, apparently

unconcerned about the trend in inflation. If you look  at what's been happening to inflation, inflation has  been accelerating over recent quarters and I can't point  to any evidence that suggests that inflation is yet to  hit its peak even on the fudged basis that we are now

forced to deal with. Also we're in a world environment  where there is increasing concern about inflation and  for the first time you're seeing the Japanese genuinely  concerned about inflation. You're seeing the Americans

seeing an acceleration in inflation in that country.   You're seeing an upward trend in interest rates in most  major countries as a result. While countries can act  independently I would like to see the circumstances

created in which we can sustain that independence. We  can sustain lower interest rates because we get  inflation under control. And you haven't got inflation  under this control in this country. In fact, you never  have under this Government. On the one occasion they  got inflation to come down a bit in, when was it '85,  early '86, as a result of basically flattening the  economy the same way as they did now and at the time it

showed up in sequential data as a recession. They  didn't sustain it there and it wasn't long before the  effects of the weak currency then subsequently the  acceleration in demand took inflation back up over 8-9%  where it presently is. So they have had no answer to

inflation and this magic document called the Accord  hasn't done what it was supposed to do which is actually  provide the basis on which they would control inflation.  Indeed, while it may have brought lower wage increases  than people thought might have occurred over that period

they haven't been competitive wage increases, either in  nominal terms in some cases but particularly relative to  productivity in this country which has been flat to  negative so that nominal unit labour costs are roughly

double those of our trading partners and have been right  through this Government. So there's no competitive wage  outcomes. That in turn has put a substantial floor  under inflation which in turn has put a substantial

floor under our interest levels. There's a long way to  go in structural change in terms of this Government's  attitude before they can create the circumstances for a  sustainable reduction in interest rates.

Jrnlst: Dr Hewson last week the Leader of the National Party, Charles Blunt, was running around Queensland making a  lot of promises. You've subsequently issued a press  release saying that they're not commitment.  Effectively, what's the difference to the man in the

11

Hewson:

Jrnlst:

Hewson:

Jrnlst:

Hewson:

Jrnlst:

street who hears those promises and thinks they're  commitments?

I only observed one beat up of what Charles had said in  our so-called leading daily newspaper which to me, if  you'd look back at what Charles had said, the issue was  drought relief, he said he would review the issue of  drought relief and whether it would be part of the  National Disaster Program. I was asked about that and

said quite consistently we haven't made any commitments  on drought relief. There's no line entry in our  Economic Action Plan for increased expenditure for the  drought relief and, so as far as our first term or first  budget goes, as specified in the Economic Action Plan it

isn't there. Charles didn't say it was there and I  didn't say it was there. That doesn't mean that it  can't be stated as a policy objective down the track  which is to be re-assessed at any other future time as

anything can.

He has been giving a misleading impression though by  saying that the Coalition will do this and do that and  then to one constituency you come out and say well it  doesn't ..(inaudible)..

It hasn't caused me any pain. As far as I can see the  only people it's causing pain are one or two in the  gallery. I'm quite happy with the fact that Charles  isn't spending money in our first budget or our first  year as outlined in the Economic Action Plan

..(inaudible). Anything else that's in any of the other  policy documents that isn't in the Economic Action Plan  is to be considered at a later stage but it won't be in  that Economic Action Plan as implemented in our first  budget.

You said a little earlier that you might have to put in  one or two extra things in the run-up to the election ..

.. may or may not, it's not my decision ..

..(inaudible)., this drought relief in that sort of  category ..(inaudible)..

12

Hews on: You shouldn't conclude anything is in that category at  all, one way or the other. Indeed, the category may not  even exist. But I just established the principle, or  repeated the principle I should say, we established in  the Economic Action Plan which is that if we make any  changes off that base in a policy sense we'll tell you,

and if they involve additional expenditure, we'll tell  you where the money's coming from and you can judge us  on that basis. The point I was making before is I think  the same criteria ought to be applied to anything the  Government does between now and the next election and

indeed they should explain where they money's come from  for the decisions they've taken since the last budget.  But I'm not trying to steer you in one direction or  another.

Jrnlst: (Question inaudible)

Hewson: I read what Charles' press release said and to me a  review isn't a commitment. It's a commitment to have a  review but it's not a commitment to spend money. I  didn't think Charles said anything different to what I

said.

Jrnlst: Did you see the policy statement?

Hews on: Yes, the policy statement I also read and there are a  number of policy statements that say things that didn't  find their way into our Economic Action Plan. That's  the only thing we can do. The Government makes a lot of  policy statements but if you want to know what their  policy is you look at the stance of interest rates,  monetary policy, fiscal policy, I mean the details

there. We're only applying the same principles to  ourselves.

Jrnlst: Question inaudible.

Hewson: What Charles said was accurate. You're doing your best to beat it up but there's nothing to beat up. It's just  a straight statement of the situation. No inconsistency  between Charles and myself as you'd expect.

Thank y ou.
