Labor and Coalition locked in race to the  bottom

The Greens have express dismay at new lows in the tenor of debate regarding immigration  policy in Australia.

“Labor and the Collation are locked in a race to the bottom, trying to outdo each other on who  can be the harshest to refugees in a bid to win cheap votes,” the Greens’ immigration  spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.

“The Coalition’s announcement has pulled back the veil of concern and showed that Mr Abbott  has no interest in reducing the number of people embarking on dangerous boat journeys,  because reducing Australia’s humanitarian intake forces people onto boats.

“The old parties know that they need to offer safer pathways to reduce boat arrivals, but they  are refusing to do so.

“The Coalition’s immigration policies are just a terrible patchwork of misinformation and  demonization.

“Mr Abbott’s language where he insists on calling refugees ‘illegal’, where he says Australia is  suffering at the hands of a ‘peaceful invasion’ is reminiscent of Pauline Hanson’s despicable  rhetoric and it represents a new low in the debate.”
