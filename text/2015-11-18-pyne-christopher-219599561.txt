JOURNALIST:         The member for Sturt, Christopher Pyne who is of course the  Leader of Government Business in the House and also the Minister for Industry and his  opponent Anthony Albanese who is a former deputy Prime Minister of Australia, Labor  member for Grayndler in Sydney going head to head every Wednesday only here on  5AA. Guys’ thank you for joining us again now as you would expect, today’s segment is  going to be dominated to a large degree by the events in France over the last couple of  days. I’ll kick off with you if I can Chris, in principle do you support any increase in  Australia’s military commitment to the war in Syria and Iraq?

CHRISTOPHER PYNE:     Well good morning David and Will and Anthony and it’s good  to be joining you again. Obviously the Cabinet and the NSC need to continuously  monitor our involvement in the middle east, we are making a significant contribution and  per capita is one of the most significant contributions of any country, but if we decided to  do more we would obviously need to seriously consider the ramifications, the response  form the Australian public and what we could conceivably militarily do that could assist.  Obviously the entire world is uniting against ISIL and the Prime Minister Malcolm  Turnbull has been at the G20 in Turkey and now APEC in Manilla where they’ve been  talking about a united front bringing in soviet, well Russia and the United States and  other countries working together. And I think that’s the right way to develop our  response to ISIL’s threat.

JOURNALIST:         What about you Anthony, what’s Labor’s sense of this? Because  there’s been a very fierce and understandable response from the French in reaction to

what happened on the streets of Paris on Friday night, is the Labor party comfortable  with the idea of Australia upping their involvement?

ANTHONY ALBANESE:     Well this is a bipartisan issue, this is a threat to our  democratic way of life, and these people want to destroy our values and what we stand  for. The attack on Paris, the city of liberty, is an attempt to, by people who want  essentially barbarism they want to wind back the clock to an uncivilised age. We  certainly stand ready to work with the government in a bipartisan way and I think the  whole of Australia feels like that. We want this to be an issue that totally unites us and  the Government has given appropriate briefings when they’ve been required and we’d  expect that to occur in the future. But I would certainly be hopeful that this is an issue  that we spoke on as a nation rather than the Liberal party or the Labor Party.



CHRISTOPHER PYNE: Effectively we are united against the threat to our way of life  against ISIL and we have to win both militarily, diplomatically and in a humanitarian  sense after the war is completed.

ANTHONY ALBANESE: I think also there are some lessons that have been learnt  perhaps by recent history. The truth is that our engagement in Iraq, and there was a bit  of a view by the western powers that the introduction of democracy would be a good  thing, the so called Arab spring in Egypt and Libya and other nations in that region it’s  pretty hard to argue there have been improvements in reality and Assad is obviously  someone we would have fundamental disagreements with but the idea of supporting his  overthrow without knowing what would replace it I think has meant that that country has  descended into chaos. And I note John Howard’s comments overnight. John Howard  has put some views out there about the way forward and I think it is a really good thing  that the United States and Russia are working together now rather than having a proxy  power struggle in the region.

JOURNALIST: Just in terms of some of the discussion about it domestically, in the last  hour or so the Grand Mufti of Australia has issued a statement where he has now  unequivocally condemned the terror attacks in France and removed all of the many  caveats on it the other day.

I noticed that this morning, Chris Pyne, you had a crack at the Independent South  Australian Senator Nick Xenophon for making some remarks when you appeared on  with him on Q and A on Monday when he appeared to be saying that you could link  what happened on Saturday to the Iraq War.

CHRISTOPHER PYNE: Well I’m glad the Grand Mufti’s done that (inaud If I was to  comment on the Grand Mufti’s statements I’d very studiously avoid any criticism  because I think now is not the time to be engaging in domestic tit for tat politics - quite  the opposite - we are in a very serious and grave situation and there’s been another  bomb scare in Hanover, this time today. Well Senator Xenophon did say on QandA on  Monday night that ISIL didn’t exist before the second Iraq War, leaving the inference

hanging that somehow the United States and the West were responsible for ISIL. Of  course ISIL existed in Syria as a response to the Assad Regime and if Senator  Xenophon meant that, I think it’s a very muddle-held view of Middle Eastern politics. If  he didn’t mean that, I think he needs to clarify that statement because it certainly leaves  the wrong impression with people and it’s one the arguments of course that people use  against the West to say that somehow we brought this upon ourselves. That is a very  wrong view and Senator Xenophon needs to clarify that I think today otherwise people  will have the wrong impression of what he meant.

JOURNALIST: Anthony Albanese, in the wake of what took place in Paris over the  weekend, there’s been a couple of really strong sentiments that have come through  from our listeners. One has obviously been sympathy, there’s been a deal of frustration  too about how we might solve this problem and deal with the issues that come out of the  Middle East, but another has been with regard to the 13,000 Syrian refugees that we’re  accepting into the country certainly in light of the identification of a Syrian passport on  one of those terrorists in France, there is real fear amongst our listeners that in doing  the right thing and opening our arms to some of these 13,000 there might be a handful  of people who are entering the country with a view to doing the wrong thing. Do you  share those concerns at all?

ANTHONY ALBANESE: Look, I’m very confident that the Australian Government will  have the appropriate screenings in place. We support the Government’s decision to do  our bit to assist in those people who are after all - these are the victims of the Islamic  State not it’s proponents and it’s important to remember as well that just one week ago  that the attack in Beirut was the worst attack since the Lebanese Civil War ended more  than two decades ago, resulted in multiple fatalities and that the Islamic State’s main  victims have been people of Islamic faith. These are people who attack people who  happen to disagree with them and their barbaric view of the world and it is appropriate  that we do our bit. Australian security checks will be in place and these are people who  are not, of course, randomly entering our nation. These are people who are being  selected and screened and I’d be very confident in the Australian Government’s  processes.

JOURNALIST:         Well it makes you, I might give Christopher Pyne an opportunity to  respond to that as well, the concerns of our listeners, do you share any of those  concerns?

CHRISTOPHER PYNE:      Well what happened in Paris on the weekend and in  Hanover today reminds us that we have to be very vigilant, very vigilant. It also reminds  us that I think, and I’m glad that Anthony raised it, that when there is an atrocity  committed against Christians and Muslims in the Middle East like the one in Beirut, like  the ones recently in Peshawar in Pakistan, or whether they occur in Afghanistan we  have to equally condemn those acts of terrorism when they happen against our own  western way of life in Europe because we need the entire moderate world whether its  Muslim or Christian working together against extremists. In terms of the screening of the  Syrian refuges we have very sophisticated methods of screening people coming to

Australia, you can’t assume that absolutely everybody who comes to Australia will turn  out to be a perfect citizen, and we’ve seen examples of that in the last year or so, the  Lindt CafÃÂ© is obviously an example of that. You can’t assume that everybody will always  be a perfect citizen whether they’re Muslims, whether they’re Christians or whether they  have no religion. But in terms of the 12 000 Syrian refugees that are coming here I am  very confident that we have the best screening methods in the world and that we are a  model of how to do that.

JOURNALIST:         Yeah I think that’s one issue particularly after that passport was  found on the Syrian chap who had taken part in the attacks on the weekend, and it  emerged he’d established his refugee credentials fraudulently that’s something that a lot  of people have picked up on it’s a…

CHRISTOPHER PYNE:     And you also have to think about the scale of the issue in the  Europe. The number of people seeking refuge or coming to Europe as economic  refugees is numbering in the hundreds of thousands. And it’s very much easier to get to  Europe of course than it is to get to Australia because there’s a land bridge and only the  Mediterranean separating the Middle East from Europe. So it’s a very different situation  that they face than to what we face here.

JOURNALIST:         Well look it was a lot more serious this segment than it has been to  date but that’s the nature of the times to Christopher Pyne,

CHRISTOPHER PYNE:     serious times.

JOURNALIST:         Absolutely, and Anthony Albanese thanks very much for joining us  this morning.

ANTHONY ALBANESE:   Peace be with you, and hopefully next week we’ll be in a  better mood I think it has really darkened the whole world

CHRISTOPHER PYNE:     You’ll be back to your usual self, Anthony.

ANTHONY ALBANESE:   He always has to go the low road. I didn’t even mention the

police raids about James Ashby…

JOURNALIST:         We’ll save that for next Wednesday! That’s good, there’s question  one for next time.
