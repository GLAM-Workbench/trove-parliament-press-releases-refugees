Tow-backs cost lives and now Labor wants in

The Labor Party's eagerness to adopt Tony Abbott's tow backs shows that they are happy to send  refugees home to face death and torture in exchange for cheap political points, the Australian  Greens have said.

“Tow-backs are dangerous and, by stopping people from fleeing their war torn homelands, they cost  lives," the Greens' immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.

“Labor have gone to water in the face of Tony Abbott's cheap, politically motivated cruelty  campaign.

“The Labor and Liberal parties are now neck and neck in the race to the bottom and it's Australia  that's losing out.

“When there's more people in the world than ever seeking protection, and the growing catastrophes  in Iraq and Syria, the idea that Australia can just turn a blind eye is as naive as it is arrogant.

“There was a time when Labor stood up for refugees and for Australians who believed in a fair go for  all. That time is over.

“Compassion isn't a sign of weakness, it's a sign of a strong and inclusive society. Compassion is what  we should be aiming for and it's what the Labor Party has lost sight of in their desperate attempts to  scrape votes from the bottom of the barrel.”
