UNEDITED TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER'S ADDRESS TO THE

COMMONWEALTH HEADS OF GOVERNMENT MEETING, LONDON, 9 JUNE 1977

The remarks made by the Prime Minister of Singapore and the reply   from Guyana yesterday have prompted me to try and put one   or two points from an Australian perspective. ' .  " Â·  - '  Â·  .  .

of all these things that'ultimately determines what happens, whether .  it is in my part of the world, or whether it is in other parts.

If I could give one or two examples.  The choice was mentioned  yesterday between Communism and anti-Communism, and .  . Prime Minister Lee mentioned some facets of Communism which appear  to have been the same: that refugees always flee; people do

not seem to want to go to Communist regimes; the countries  have not escaped its embrace once it has absorbed them. On the other hand, I believe,  it is very clear to all of us that  there are great differences between the Communism practised in '  ' different countries or at least in the attitude of those countries.

It would be hard to say Russian and Chinese Communism is the  same or Yugoslavian or Vietnamese Communism. Do we know  yet how divergent Communism in different countries is going to  become or do we believe that in the future they will become more  and more the same? .  .  ,

In the nature of things I think it is more likely that there would  be a divergence and perhaps an increasing one,  but quite obviously^  South-East". Asia'  is much affected by the course that China takes,  by decisions that China makes, or fails to make, by support

for activities outside its own borders one way or another,  and  South-East Asia can also be much affected by the course of . Vietnamese actions, by the relationship that develops between  the present states of Indo-China and China itself. We cannot avoid being affected at least in my part of the world  by the flow out of these particular changes. .  .

In another area where I believe the Australian position, has often been much misquoted by the media - I think any statements ^ I have made or my Foreign Minister has made have been moderate   the Indian Ocean. We have been concerned for balance, balance at the   lowest possible level,  and certainly do not want to see any arms   race between super powers or anyone else in that particular area,   but we do want to see a balance. People might disagree with t hatzÂ®^   but I have not really heard that concept itself attacked. Why is that area important? It is not only important to the   littoral states, but it is also important to Japan, as a source '

of oil supplies which must get through the trade routes. If that were at any stage, at any time, interdicted there would   obviously'be very serious consequences not only for Japan but   for the course of action that Japan v/ould have to take to protect   her own future .  So again \^e have an inter-relationship and I think

sometimes we might fail to stand off sufficiently far to understand   the full consequences of actions that might take place in one   corner, and to note that those consequences might be

in much wider areas. .

Prime Minister Lee also mentioned the question ..of trade and '   protection.  I believe this is something that affects all of us, ; but it is also a subject which we all intrinsically look at from our : own particular points of view. I know quite well that Asian .  1

countries,  for example, would want a greater degree of trade ) with Australia, greater access to Australia's markets ,  even thougn |   those markets are in total relatively small. But protection \ on our protected goods ,  manufactured goods, has in fact cone down j  about thirty percent, and for the last several years Asian trade j

one' of the countries in that particular area stop it against  major powers? I think it might be very difficult to '

stop.So again, it is a question of what everyone does that Â· affects us all. The course that Japan1  takes, I have indicated,  could have repercussions over a much wider area, even though we did  not want it. Europe involved the whole world in world wars twice and noi  we hope that the European Economic Community and its political objectivi  will prevent that ever happening again. Again, wherever we live, "there is a possibility not only of being infected but by being involved - even against our world - and I think .

this again indicates it is not really possible to shut doors and pretend that problems ofrdiffaculties do not exist. .  ;  .

The question of human rights, which is very much in our minds  and in the minds of many people, obviously affects the relationship  between nations and the problems of Southern Africa are going to be{^  discussed at a later occasion, but there there are the policies  pursued by countries which are an offence to human decency and  are a scourge on the dignity of man. How long will they continue?

I think there is no policy more offensive than the policy of  Apartheid, and whatever one might think of it in terms of '  fjp its own logic, it is doomed to failure, but at the same time to suggest  that what happens in Africa is not going to affect relations between  places in many different countiTfes - nobody is suggesting that: now.  but again, emphasising the point that there is inter-relationship  between what happens in one place, with what happens in another

place, even though it might be.on the other side of the world. It cannot be ignored.

Just a couple of other points. I sometimes suspect there is a danger of habit for international forums. The problems . are there and they remain. Vie are here this year. If they are not solved we will be back again in a couple of years and maybe progress will be made before then. I would hope the Commonwealth

can put aside the danger of habit, and have a renewed approach, as the Prime Minister of India,  I- think, wanted to. see in major problen^-'x What; happens is not really separable and we cannot pretend things are not going to affect us. I suspect the presence of everyone

here is a recognition of that. Vie should make sure words do not become a substitute for action, but at the same time we need . a tolerance which has a.lready been demonstrated in the diverse views around this forum. We need to understand the consequences of our actions not only on ourselves, but on other people sometimes far from us, an inter-relation between what we do, and what other people do, is very real; that it needs to be understood

and I would very much hope than when we get to the specific areas, and are recognising some of the points that .

have been made during the course of this debate, we will be able -to take advances on specific areas which will come before us.  rq -
