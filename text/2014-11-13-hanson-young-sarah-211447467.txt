Refugees released on Manus will be put in  danger

Any refugees that are temporarily resettled in PNG will face unacceptable danger, the Australian  Greens have said.

“They were attacked in the camp and they’ll be attacked on the outside,” the Greens’  immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.

“It’s ludicrous, and dangerous in the extreme, to dump these men in the Manus community.  They will be targeted in the same way that refugees on Nauru have been.

“The fact that PNG’s Immigration Minister has himself refused to guarantee their safety is  extremely concerning.

“Scott Morrison’s obsession with offshore detention, at whatever cost, has put these men in  danger and slugged the tax payer for billions of dollars.

“Australia should be processing refugee claims in our region, before people are forced onto a  boat, and increasing our humanitarian intake. We can save lives while caring for people, without  forcing refugees to live in danger on Manus Island.”
