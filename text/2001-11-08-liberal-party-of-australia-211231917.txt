MINISTER FOR DEFENCE

TRANSCRIPT OF THE HON PETER REITH

DOORSTOP INTERVIEW - SHERATON HOTEL, PERTH



8 November 2001



REITH:



Can I just start by saying that Mr Beazley announced some further capability for the Special Air Services regiment. This was a policy out of the blue yesterday from him. We've had that costed at over $200 million dollars over four years. Mr Beazley, where is the money coming from? And this is typical of the Leader of the Opposition, he makes policy commitments with no idea as to the implications of those policy commitments. They are just commitments made on the run without any proper context and it just demonstrates that Mr Beazley is not a good person for running defence as his record in defence shows.



JOURNALIST:



Well, the real issue is why did you take so long to see that video?



REITH:



Oh look, I still haven't seen that video.



JOURNALIST:



But you said [inaudible]'that somebody had seen that video and that it definitely showed a child being thrown overboard. Now you are backing away from that now are you?



REITH:



No. What I said was that the advice that I had at the time'



JOURNALIST:



A child had been thrown overboard.



REITH:



Excuse me. The advice that I had at the time and the statement that I made was that I had received advice which said that the video confirmed the advice that I had. That's what I said.



JOURNALIST:



[Inaudible]



REITH:



Excuse me. What I said was and it's still the case that I have not myself seen the video and what I said on the public record was that I had advice from Defence from somebody who had seen the video that they said that it confirmed the advice that I got. Now, that is a true statement at the time then and it's a true statement today. The advice that I had got was that somebody else had seen the video, I had not seen it, still haven't seen it, and that it was confirmation of what I was being told.



JOURNALIST:



[Inaudible]'that children were thrown into the water'



REITH:



That is the statement that I made'



JOURNALIST:



[Inaudible]'.advice from the Navy?



REITH:



Well, there has been various advice, for example, the PM referred to an intelligence report that he had'



JOURNALIST:



[Inaudible] and put the matter to rest.



REITH:



Well, Mr'



JOURNALIST:



[Inaudible]



REITH:



I am sorry but you have asked your question.



JOURNALIST:



[Inaudible]'knew about it beforehand [inaudible]'



REITH:



Look, I am happy to answer questions but I do need to have one question at a time. As the Prime Minister said this morning if somebody wants to have a look at that intelligence advice, for example Mr Beazley, then they can do so. We would not and do not release intelligence advice but that was a written advice that he had. I have also seen other written advice which had that statement in it. Now, you have go to put it in a context though, the context is that'



JOURNALIST:



There's a lot of questions [inaudible]'



REITH:



May I finish? I am sorry, but you have asked your question and I am entitled to answer it and intend to do so. You need to put this in context. The context was that with this particular boat we had also advice that the engine had been sabotaged, that the steering had been sabotaged, that the people on the boat were very difficult to deal with, that the advice that they had received about what had happened about entering into Australian waters being illegal, was thrown onto the boat by our people and was thrown off again.



Now, the fact is that these people were very difficult. I am told that the video does show a person holding a child on the top deck. Now, the video apparently is still not easy to see because of some of the actions on the other side of the boat. I appreciate that. But in the context that these people were very difficult to deal with, and that was the advice coming to me from Defence at that time and prior to that particular incident, the fact is that there was no surprise to me that these people were doing absolutely everything possible to require us to pick them up.



And remember also that in the final incident this boat actually went under water, it actually sank. And as I have said on the public record, I can't prove it but my suspicions are that a boat that seemed to be seaworthy at the time suddenly sank was a very suspicious situation.



JOURNALIST:



[Inaudible]



REITH:



The position is this and that is that in terms of these boat arrivals of which we have had quite a number we get verbal advice from Defence as to what has happened and when there is a big demand for information we have tried to provide information to people on the basis of that advice. Now, you might say well should we have auditors on board Navy ships, should we have cameramen, you know, taking film of everything, people with sound equipment to record absolutely everything. Well, we have not done that, I wouldn't expect to do so'.



JOURNALIST:



[Inaudible]



REITH:



Well, I have had advice which I relayed publicly which I thought was reasonable. We did, I don't mind telling you, we did when we first heard that advice we sought confirmation of it. So you know we issued that advice on a bona fide basis.



JOURNALIST:



Mr Reith, [inaudible] confirm that advice by looking at the tape?



REITH:



Well, I still haven't seen the tape'



JOURNALIST:



Why?



REITH:



The comments I made, it might be difficult for you to understand, but the comments that I have made I have made based on advice.



JOURNALIST:



[Inaudible]



REITH:



With great respect, can I finish my answer.



JOURNALIST:



It's a very serious matter.



REITH:



It is a serious matter and therefore you should listen to my answer if you'



JOURNALIST:



[Inaudible]'Mr Beazley and tell us what happened.



REITH:



Can I just answer your question? I made it very clear at the time that the comments that I was making were based on verbal advice that we had had. And I made it very clear at the time that I had not seen the video. It has never been my position that I have seen the video therefore this proves anything. It's never been my position that I was relying on the video. And from what I am now told'



JOURNALIST:



The commander of the ship would have given you that verbal advice [inaudible]'



REITH:



I don't speak to the operational commander. I'll take one more question and then I have to go.



JOURNALIST:



Why haven't you seen the video?



REITH:



Well, because the comments that I made were made on the basis of verbal advice, not on the basis of the video.



JOURNALIST:



[Inaudible]



REITH:



I am sorry but to again put it in context, these matters happen and the video was on the ship and as we said at the time we didn't have access to the video. People asked us what had happened and we relayed what we were told. It's as simple as that.



JOURNALIST:



[Inaudible]



REITH:



Oh look, I also said, just to answer that question, I have also said on the public record prior to the last few days that my understanding is that it was a pretty confused situation.



JOURNALIST:



[Inaudible]



REITH:



With great respect, I do intend to finish the answer. You can imagine that when people were jumping into the water which the video demonstrates the crew of the ship mainly focussed on getting people out of the water, they weren't focussed on having a post-mortem after they got into the water, they were just rushing madly to get people out of the water.



JOURNALIST:



[Inaudible]'after the Navy had already made a call that the boat was breaking up and that it was sinking'



REITH:



Just to repeat the'



JOURNALIST:



[Inaudible]



REITH:



Well, I am sorry but you are mistaken and I'll explain it to you. Can I just answer the point. In this particular case there had been a warning shot some hours earlier ' some hours earlier ' and I am on the public record just so that you can check the actual facts, but I think it was three or four hours earlier. There was later a boarding on the ship, on the boat, and around that time these people were jumping off the boat. So the boat was seaworthy at this time, no question of that whatsoever.
