THE HON RICHARD MARLES MP  SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND BORDER  PROTECTION  MEMBER FOR CORIO



E&OE TRANSCRIPT  RADIO INTERVIEW  ABC WORLD TODAY WITH ALEXANDRA KIRK  MONDAY, 27 OCTOBER 2014



SUBJECT/S: Asylum seekers



RICHARD MARLES, SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND BORDER  PROTECTION: We have got concerns about the turn back policy, which I articulated  yesterday. We are open minded about anything which saves lives at sea but we retain  two real concerns about the turn back policy, and in this respect, our position has not  changed.

ALEXANDRA KIRK: Will you argue in the lead up to the election that Labor adopt a  policy of turning back the boats if it is safe and if it does not affect the relationship, or  doesn’t erode the relationship between Australia and Indonesia?

MARLES: Well I’m not going to walk down the path of answering hypotheticals, Alex,  the question…

KIRK: But you did when you said you were open minded, if those two things could be  sorted out.

MARLES: I’ve made clear our concerns in respect of turn backs, and there is a huge  issue in terms of the impact this is having on our relationship with Indonesia and I think  the real question, which I articulated yesterday, is how do we get to a point as a country

where we have the same kind of hand in glove co-operation that we enjoyed with  Indonesia when Labor was in power.

KIRK: So do you remain open minded about turning back the boats?

MARLES: Well, I have articulated our concerns about the turn back policy.

KIRK: And if those concerns are addressed?

MARLES: Well as I say, I’m not going to walk down that path, I think -

KIRK: But you walked down that path yesterday -

MARLES: The point for the Government is to answer the question about how they are  going to restore the kind of co-operative relationship which we used to enjoy with  Indonesia in circumstances where they have a policy in place which the Indonesians  hate.
