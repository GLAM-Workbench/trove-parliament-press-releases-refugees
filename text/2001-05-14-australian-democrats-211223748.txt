DETENTION CENTRES OUT OF CONTROL

Time For Full Inquiry & Scrapping Of Mandatory Detention

The Australian Democrats say the latest riot at Port Headland detention centre shows that   management of our detention centres is now out of control.

Democrats’ Immigration spokesperson Senator Andrew Bartlett said “the fact that riots are   becoming a regular occurrence shows that mandatory detention has failed.”

“It is time for a full open inquiry to find out why things have gone so wrong.”

“It is also time for both Labor and Liberal to drop their support for mandatory detention and to   move to a more humane, effective and cheaper alternative.”

“Claims that moving away from compulsory detention will lead to a flood of illegal arrivals are   without foundation.”

“The numbers of arrivals have increased dramatically since detention was brought in by Labor and   has continued despite increasing harshness of conditions and government attitudes.”

“More and more taxpayers’ money is being wasted in propping up a failed *system and persecuting   people who have already suffered extensively.”

“The Democrats call for an immediate move away from the failed policy of mandatory detention.”

“A comprehensive independent inquiry should also be held immediately to enable the full   story to come out about the failed management and conditions of our detention centres.”
