HIGH COURT WORKLOAD NEEDS ADDRESSING

Attorney-General, Philip Ruddock, said the Annual Report for the High Court of  Australia confirms the pressing need to address the huge increases in the Court’s  workload and the importance of Government moves to respond.

The High Court’s 2002-03 Annual Report tabled today, shows the number of matters  filed during the year increased by 217 per cent from the previous 12 months.

A substantial proportion of this increase was in the filing of constitutional writs - up  from 300 to 2,131 - of which 99 per cent were migration matters.

The number of self-represented litigants appearing before the Court was also high.  This group accounted for 42 per cent of applications for special leave to appeal,  although 99 per cent of those applications were refused.

“The Australian Government shares the High Court’s concerns about the burden that  self-represented litigants are placing on the Court and the increasing volume of  unmeritorious cases being filed,” Mr Ruddock said.

“However, any proposal to address this issue must be balanced against the need to  ensure that access to justice is not unfairly denied to people who are not legally  represented.”

Another issue the High Court has to manage is the increasing number of migration  matters. These made up 82 per cent of all matters filed in 2002-03 compared to 41 per  cent in the previous year.

“The increase in the number of migration cases in the courts is concerning, especially  with the very low success rate of this litigation and the overall delay that this creates  for other people pursuing other matters.

“At the same time the Government is committed to ensuring that applicants with  genuine claims have those claims properly considered.

“The Government established the Migration Litigation Review late last year to look  at more efficient management of migration cases. The Government is considering the  recommendations of the review.

Additionally, a comprehensive paper on the federal civil justice system, which  addresses proposals to assist self-represented litigants and reduce the number of  unmeritorious claims, will be released shortly,” Mr Ruddock said.
