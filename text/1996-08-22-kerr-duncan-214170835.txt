The Howard Government has finally admitted that the Humanitarian Program is to be  reduced to 10 000 places offshore from 1997-98 onwards. The Minister, Philip Ruddock,  went to great pains when he made the announcement of the 1996-97 program, to suggest it  was not an ongoing reduction, rather he was accounting for the 2000 places brought forward

The Minister, of course, has not announced this by media release, but a short paragraph in the  Budget Paper. He also confirms the overall number of Humanitarian and Refugee Program  places is now capped. Should the onshore visa number, set at 2000 be exceeded, the excess  will be deducted from the offshore visas granted.

This will fundamentally undermine our international commitment to the orderly acceptance  of refugees and asylum seekers. Should an international incident whereby a large number of  refugees seek our obligation for protection (similar to Tiananmen Square), it would have a  catastrophic effect on the orderly arrangements with the United Nations High Commission for  Refugees (UNHCR).

Effects of measures from various portfolios on the Budget outlays for the next four years  show that the Howard Government is intending to cut, restrict and squeeze nearly  $125 million from those who were promised they "will not be ignored or forgotten by (the  Coalition) government policies and programs. We (the Coalition) will direct resources to  overcome their pressing disadvantages and hardship."

The degree of deceit would stun even the cynics. The asylum seekers, the most vulnerable in  any society, have certainly not been forgotten or ignored by the Howard Government's  ideological chopper.
