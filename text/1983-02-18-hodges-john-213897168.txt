An audio-visual series called "Neighbourhood Living",  aimed at helping migrants

and refugees settle into the community, will be launched in Melbourne on

Monday, by the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, John Hodges.

The launching will be held at Collingwood Education Centre, theatrette

Vere Street, Collingwood, at 10.45 a.m. '  .

The series will give new arrivals information about living in suburban

Australia. The series, produced on videotape by Film Australia, covers

topics such as "garbage do’s and don *  ts ", renting, tenancy pitfalls,

immunisation programs and community services.

The tapes will be available in seven community languages - Vietnamese, Khmer,

Lao, Cantonese, Polish, Spanish and Arabic - and written material will be

available for viewers to take away after they have seen the tapes. Â·

Migrant Resource Centres, migrant centres and regional offices of the Department

of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs will have copies of the videotapes, to be

shown or lent to migrants and refugees.

Mr Hodges said the series grew out of the Fairfield (NSW) Council's concern

at the lack of knowledge in the community about the role played by local

government and the services it offered.

"A bonus in making the series has been the positive contribution it has made to

fostering harmony in the community. Film Australia reported almost overwhelming

co-operation from the people of Fairfield.

"I believe that the "Neighborhood Living" series is a

significant addition to a broad range of services available to

new settlers through the Department of Immigration and Ethnic

Affairs, and through state and local government.

"All these services recognise that people arriving in Australia

from different cultural environments face needs which arise

directly from their status as migrants and refugees.

"The Neighborhood Living" series is a welcome addition to the

services provided to meet these needs."
