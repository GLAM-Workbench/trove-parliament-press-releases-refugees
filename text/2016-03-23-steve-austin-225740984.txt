Interview

ABC Brisbane with Steve Austin

8.35am   23 March 2016

E & OE

AUSTIN:

You’d know that we have a de facto election campaign underway, one hundred  odd days god help us, because of a disagreeable Senate that you might head to  the polls as early as July Second.

My next guest is fully immersed in this fray and is a key player for the Federal  Government in the upper house, Senator Mitch Fifield is Federal Minister for  Communications and the Arts and is Manager of Government business in the  Senate. He’s in Brisbane, thanks for coming in.

FIFIELD:

Good to be with you Steve.

AUSTIN:

I know it’s not your portfolio, but is there anything more the Federal Government  knows about what’s occurred in Belgium?

FIFIELD:

Well I think the first reaction of everyone in government is basically a human one.  Horrified by what we see. Knowing that it can happen here, and has sadly  happened in Australia. We saw the Lindt CafÃÂ© tradgedy. So the first reaction is  very much a human one.

Secondly as a government, we have to move to think about the situation of  Australians who maybe over there. And our advice to people who may have family  or friends in Belgium is, firstly to try and make contact with them. If you can’t, then

Subjects: Belgium Terror Attack, Clean Energy Innovation Fund, ABCC,  media reform in QLD

do feel free to call 1300 555 135 which is the Department of Foreign Affairs  Consular Advice Line. So that’s our prime focus at the moment. But obviously with  the rest of the international community we want to do everything we possibly can  to bring these people to justice.

AUSTIN:

The Federal Government has a Security Committee have they changed Australia’s  Security Threat Level at all?

FIFIELD:

I heard the Attorney this morning say that our threat level has not been altered. I  guess it’s worth pausing at a time like this to reflect that our great strength as a  western liberal democracy is our freedom and our openness. But that also, in a  sense, is our vulnerability, the fact that we are open. So we’ve got to do whatever  we can to protect ourselves.

AUSTIN:

The man Abdul Salam who was arrested last week in Belgium was not an  immigrant. While he was an Arabic speaker, he was not an Arabic immigrant. He  was a Belgium born citizen. And as I understand it, the big concern or the big  threat for many of these terror incidents in non-Middle Eastern Countries are not  from immigrants but actually from people who are born in a county and seemingly  grow up with contempt for the country they’ve grown up in. What can any  government do about that?

FIFIELD:

Well one of the very troubling things is that a number young people are attracted  to this deeply offensive world view. I think we’ve got to take a step back and think,  what is it that young people are looking for? Ultimately they are looking for  something that is bigger than themselves. And sadly some young people are  finding a cause bigger than themselves in this...

AUSTIN:

... So something to stand and believe in?

FIFIELD:

Yes, I think that’s what people are looking for.

AUSTIN:

So it’s an existential question isn’t it?

FIFIELD:



Well yes. But as a society what we’ve got to say to these young people is that  there are many good, great and wonderful things bigger than yourself that are  positive and that are good.

AUSTIN:

In the post-Christian west what do we offer? If Judeo Christian values have  collapsed and belief in God is declining and declining not in the world, but only in  western countries, western democracies, what do we offer if we say there is  nothing beyond what we see?

FIFIELD:

Well I don’t think we do have to say that there is nothing beyond what we see. As  a pluralistic society, there are a range of good and positive alternatives that can be  presented. Those that are based around faith. Those that are based around  positive humanist values. I think there are a lot of good alternatives that we can  present to young people to say that we understand. You’re searching. You’re  questioning. You want to embrace something bigger than yourself. There are great  things, there are wonderful things, there are good things that you can embrace.  You don’t have to go down this dark and destructive path.

AUSTIN:

Why aren’t they obvious to people? Our good things, our great things, our  wonderful things. They don’t seem to be obvious even for those who aren’t  Islamic.

FIFIELD:

Well it's incumbent upon all of us to reach out to young people to present that  which is good.

AUSTIN:

Alright my guest is Senator Mitch Fifield, he’s Manager of Government Business in  the Senate, this is 612 ABC Brisbane.

One more question on this Dr David Kilcullen, Australian, ex-army guy. I know  you’re ex-army yourself but ex-army guy, advised both Condoleezza Rice and the  Iraqi Government in counter-terror, he was in Brisbane a little while ago, he toured  the country about his good Blood Year. He said look, there’s going to be more of  these and they will be in Australia. Can I get you to say, what is the Australian  Government able to do about that? Not a great deal I don’t think.

FIFIELD:

Well what is critically important are our intelligence agencies and what it is that

they are able to discover before events take place. There have been something of  the order of half a dozen significant events which have not occurred because  Australian Intelligence has provided our authorities the opportunity to disrupt those  before anything happens.

AUSTIN:

Listeners appear to be worried about what we may be importing via boat although  the evidence doesn’t necessarily support it but at least Australians are worried  about it. Can the Australian Government give any further assurances about the,  say the 15,000 Syrian people we intend on resettling here, in terms of their, you  only need one of that 15,000. That’s the difficulty for any government you only  need one successful terror event and things look a bit stressed.

FIFIELD:

Look you’ve always got to balance being a compassionate society, which we are  as Australians. We do receive and settle on a per capita basis the highest or the  second highest number of refugees. And that’s a good thing. But, as I say, you’ve  also got to make sure that you do the appropriate security checks and that’s  something that this government does.

AUSTIN:

I’m very grateful for being so generous with some of your comments this morning  Senator Fifield.

The Clean Energy Innovation Fund. We hear that Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull  will be today making some announcement about this together with the Federal  Environment Minister. Can you tell me anything about it? It’s on page eight of the  Courier, I’m fascinated to know.

FIFIELD:

Well we’ll be announcing today that the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and  the Australian Renewable Agency will be retained and that there will be a clean  energy fund of about a billion dollars which will be established. And the purpose  will be to provide capital to help encourage and support emerging technologies. It  might be something like large scale solar and storage. So it’s part of the menu of  arrangements that we will put in place to make sure that we will can meet our  emissions reductions targets.

AUSTIN:

My guest is Senator Mitch Fifield. He’s Federal Minister for Communications and  the Arts and he’s also Manager of Government Business in the Senate.

The Australian Building and Construction Commission is going back to the Senate  in April, it’s not going to get up is it? It’s not going to get through?



FIFIELD:

Steve look I’ve gone through a morning without remembering that I was the  Manager of Government Business in the Senate. You've gone and reminded me.  Thank you very much.

AUSTIN:

Does this mean you’ve failed?

FIFIELD:

No, no, Steve, look we have had a Senate, which I know all too well as the  Manager of Government Business, which has been difficult to deal with. Now there  is absolutely nothing wrong with the Senate being a house of review. With the  Senate scrutinising. With the Senate asking questions. We don’t have an issue  with that. But what we’ve been faced with over recent months is a sustained  filibuster, to use an American term, of the proceedings of the Senate. Which has  meant that it took us a long, long time to get to finally deal with electoral reform.  And it's taken a long, long time to even get to the point where we can debate the  ABCC bill. So the Prime Minister has asked the Governor General to recall the  Parliament so that the Senate can have three weeks to look at the ABCC  legislation. All we’re asking is that the Senate makes a call on it.

AUSTIN:

Someone like Senator Glenn Lazarus, came in on Clive Palmers money and then  jumped ship and is now an independent. Have you ever taken him for lunch and  had a beer and say listen here mate let me explain what we’re trying to do here?  In other words, I’m surprised how little Senators from opposing sides have actually  talked to each other and try to win each other by the power of argument and  discussion.

FIFIELD:

Look, I’ve had lunch with Glenn. I’ve had a beer with Glenn. I’ve shared meals with  most of the Senate crossbench over the time that they have been there. There has  been no lack of engagement between the Government and the crossbench. But  they have a view. They're entitled to a view. But what we find really frustrating and  this is really something that needs to be sheeted home to the Australian Labor  Party, is that the ALP continually seek to use procedural tactics and to filibuster to  prevent us actually getting to a position where the Senate can make a call.

AUSTIN:

Alright, I want to ask you about media laws because media diversity is a bit of  a  problem in this state.

Queensland has a couple of unusual features. It’s quite decentralised, we have  major centres outside of Brisbane, Cairns, Townsville. Some would argue and  some other regional places as well. But you’re bringing in significant changes to  media ownership laws. Just in the language that I can understand. What will they  mean tomorrow if you release, free up these laws for reading a newspaper,  reading a blog, listening to a radio station and watching a television network?

FIFIELD:

Well for the sake of argument, let’s assume that the laws were passed tomorrow.  The change on day one, would be none. What these laws are really predicated on  is giving media organisations the opportunity to reconfigure in ways that they  currently can’t. Now what I mean by that is, we have two media laws that we’re  seeking to get rid of. One is, what’s known as the 75% reach rule. Which means  that you can’t have a collection of TV licences which have more than 75%  audience reach around Australia. Now that’s pretty meaningless in an era where  some of the networks actually live stream and have 100% reach.

The other rule we’re looking to get rid of, is what’s called the two out of three rule.  Which prevents more than two out of three of the regulated platforms of Radio, TV  and Newspaper merging in a particular market.

AUSTIN:

That’s a real problem for us. If Australian Provincial Newspapers, sell their papers  like the Gympie Times, the Sunshine Coast Daily, whatever those smaller  co

mmunity newspapers? I mean that is a democratic disaster.

FIFIELD:

Well there are some important protections which are still in place, some media  rules which we’re not looking to alter.

AUSTIN:

They can’t make a quid. I mean the whole market seems to be collapsing doesn’t  it?

FIFIELD:

Well, let me firstly go through the protections. We’re keeping what’s known as the  one to the market rule. Which is you can’t have one outfit having more than one  TV licence in a market. And the two to a market rule. Which says you can’t have  one outfit having more than two commercial radio licences in a market. And we’re  also keeping what’s known as the five/four rule. Which is that there’s got to be in  metropolitan areas, five voices as they’re called, and in regional areas, four  voices.

So there are those diversity protections. But what we hear from media

organisations is that they want the opportunity to reconfigure. They want the  opportunity to merge in some cases to get scale. And that’s the particular  argument from some of the regional TV operations. They want to be combined in  ways that make their business more viable. And they say if they do that, they’re in  a better position to provide local content. We take them at their word. Which is why  if there is a trigger event that sees some of these mergers happen we’re going to  be putting in place and requiring a higher baseline of local content.

AUSTIN:

It’s all about convergence though isn’t it they want to converge to survive they’ve  got to have a presence on multiple platforms now.

Can I get you to attach your headphones, put you headphones on. I’ll take a quick  call from a listener. If I can’t then I’ll ask you a follow up question.

Mark is from Tarragindi, you’ve got an observation about commercial talkback  what is it? Hi mate.

LISTENER:

Good morning Steve, good morning Senator Fifield. Yes I want to know what the  Senator will do about the commercial failure in Brisbane of two of our radio  stations, where by 4BH has zero percent live and local content in a week and 4BC  h

as just over 10% live and local content in a week. Now in regional areas they are  mandated by a licence condition, small markets for you know, up to a couple of  100,000 people for 10 and a half hours of live and local content a day. I think  capital cities could at least sustain nine hours of it and I want to know what will the  Minister do about this unique problem which has emerged in Brisbane over the  last year?

AUSTIN:

It is unusual here, so 2 sorry 4BC which is arguably my main talk competitor, they  don’t have a local talk program. You’ve given them a licence but it’s coming out of  Sydney. We’ve got Ray Buggerlugs, Ray Hadley on now, magic 882 comes from  Melbourne in the morning, we’re the only local talk issues station, and the poor  taxpayer has to carry the load. Doesn’t that indicate a complete failure of what the  commercial stations are doing here?

FIFIELD:

Well I think the people who have the ultimate power when it comes to commercial  radio, are the listeners. If they don’t like the offering they can switch to another  radio station.

AUSTIN:

But they can’t in terms of local politics. You know 4BC wouldn’t get you on the air

because they’d get you on in Sydney, you know. You’d have nowhere to go Mitch.  But they’re not doing it; none of the commercials are doing it.

FIFIELD:

Yeah, look even in the case of regional TV, just as a comparator, the requirements  that we have relate to local news. There's a certain number of minutes of locally  relevant content and local news that commercial TV have to provide. So, I don’t  know the Government would ever be in the situation of mandating where  presenters, for blocks of hours, have to come from, when it comes to commercial  radio.

AUSTIN:

You do mandate for news bulletins that they have to do a certain amount of local  news content they have to.

FIFIELD:

That’s right, at the moment it’s, this is for commercial (television), it's 720 minutes  in an aggregated market over a six week period. We're wanting to move that  baseline to 900 minutes over a six week period.





But look, can I say, it would seldom be the case that it’s been raised with me,  issues of local content, in metropolitan areas, because generally it takes care of  itself and listeners determine.

AUSTIN:

It’s not a problem in Melbourne, its, not a problem in Sydney but it is a major  problem here in Brisbane.

FIFIELD:

Well it’s been registered with me, through your show Steve. But as I say, I don’t  think it’s likely that the Government will mandate that between the hours of nine  and six there's got to be four hours of a local presenter on a particular commercial  radio station.

AUSTIN:

I’ll talk to you, I’ll ask one question and I’ll let you go in just a moment I just want to  a quick check of the traffic.

[Break]

AUSTIN:

Thanks very much Dave, my guest is Senator Mitch Fifield, he’s the Manager of  Government Business in the Senate, Federal Minister for Communications and the  Arts.



I



want to ask you about regional radio. As part of the triennial funding, the ABC  has asked for money specifically for boosting regional content. Now are you of the  mind to give the ABC more money or say sorry guys you’ve got to find that within  existing budgets?

FIFIELD:

I’ll make a couple of points Steve.  The first is obviously we’re in the lead up to the budget. Part of the budget will be  the ABC’s triennial funding. So I can’t give an indication of what will be in the  budget.

AUSTIN:

I’m not asking you what’s going to be in the budget.

FIFIELD:

Ot



her than to say that we will always make sure that the ABC is appropriately  resourced. But specifically in relation to the issue of regional and rural radio. Look  this is part of the core business of the ABC. Always has been. Is now. And always  will be. This is the heart of what the ABC does. And people who live in regional  Australia are very protective of their radio, of their ABC radio. And we saw that at  the end of last year when the ABC management sought to make some changes in  particular regional locations with morning programs.

AUSTIN:

People lost their jobs and it was a very difficult time.

FIFIELD:

And there was a huge outcry. That was not, taking the ABC at their word, that was  not in order to save money and was not as a result of any decisions in relation to  funding by government. That was purely a decision of ABC management. But what  that indicated to me is just how much people in regional Australia value and have  a sense of ownership of regional radio.

We will make sure that the ABC has the dollars to do what it should do. And the  ABC should always see regional radio as a core part of its business.

AUSTIN:



So will the ABC have to find the money from within their existing budgets if you  regard it as what the ABC needs?

FIFIELD:

Well I can’t talk to what’s in the budget, you’re going to have to wait to budget  night, but rest assured the ABC will get what it needs to do its job.

AUSTIN:

I’ll let you go to your function, thanks very much.

FIFIELD:

Thanks very much Steve.

AUSTIN:

Communications and Arts Minister Mitch Fifield.
