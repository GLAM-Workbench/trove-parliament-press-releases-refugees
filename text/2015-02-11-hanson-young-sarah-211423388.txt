High Court rules in favour of refugee over Abbott government arrogance

Today’s ruling from the High Court has slated the Abbott government’s arrogance and  showed that it cannot use the ‘National Interest’ test to withhold protection visas from  refugees, the Australian Greens have said.

“The arrogance of the Abbott government and the former Immigration Minister means  they have once again fallen foul of the law,” Senator Hanson-Young said.

“The Immigration Minister is not above the law, despite his consistent efforts to  undermine the Parliament and the High Court.

“This man is a refugee, he came to Australia asking for help and it’s only after being  dragged through the courts that the government will recognise its duty and offer him  protection.

“There was no need for this. It was only the government’s own hubris that brought them  to this loss.

“The Minister should have recognised Australia’s international obligations and granted  this man a protection visa when he was found to be a refugee.”
