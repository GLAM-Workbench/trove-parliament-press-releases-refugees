LEON BYNER:

Tony Abbott?

TONY ABBOTT:

GÃ¢ÂÂday Leon, how are you?

LEON BYNER:

Good thank you. Now first of all, the business of foreign investment. This is a very serious matter; before I  get your response, have a listen to what the federal president of the Real Estate Institute, David Airey, told  us a couple of weeks ago:

[plays excerpt]

LEON BYNER:

Now, would be Prime Minister, Mr Abbott. Yesterday I had Joe Hockey sitting were you are, almost 24  hours ago. He didnÃ¢ÂÂt want to be drawn on most of this, he said he didnÃ¢ÂÂt know the facts, but the facts, apart  from the report I handed you, which is only a day old, have been around for some time. Are you alive to  them?

TONY ABBOTT:

I donÃ¢ÂÂt claim to be deeply familiar with all of these things, Leon, but I do take the point that the gentlemen  you just had on made, we do need to carefully monitor and, from time to time, disclose, exactly whatÃ¢ÂÂs  going on here. Because I think we do want to sell the food, rather than sell the farm. We would prefer to sell  food to other countries, rather than to sell off our land to other countries and in order to ensure that over time  thatÃ¢ÂÂs the case, we do need, as I said, to monitor and properly disclose -

LEON BYNER:

2

Now, now. In todayÃ¢ÂÂs national Australian, there appears to be a disparity, and itÃ¢ÂÂs only a semantic point, you  want to monitor, some of your colleagues want to register. Whatever that means, that is only an arithmetic  exercise to know what the status is. Ultimately, youÃ¢ÂÂve got to have a policy that deals with it.

TONY ABBOTT:

And my understanding is that my colleagues are all on the same page here. We do want to monitor -

LEON BYNER:

What does “monitor” mean? WhatÃ¢ÂÂs the difference between “monitor” and have a “register”?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, there is already a register of who owns the land, the state Land Titles offices know who has title to all  the land in Australia, so we donÃ¢ÂÂt want to create a new bureaucracy at the federal level, when there are  existing state bodies which do all this stuff. But certainly, at the federal level we want to be aware of just  what the foreign land holdings are and from time to time we should disclose what is happening in terms of -

LEON BYNER:

Why from time to time, why shouldnÃ¢ÂÂt it be there all the time?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I mean, fair enough, why shouldnÃ¢ÂÂt it be available all the time because monitoring and disclosing is a  contribution to our understanding and based on our understanding we can then make appropriate policy.

LEON BYNER:

Ok, you see, Australians are alive to this, not just in South Australia, but elsewhere, because they donÃ¢ÂÂt want  their land and their ability to grow food and feed themselves, I mean, you and Julia Gillard are talking a lot  about sustainability. In my view, you cannot say that word and not have in the same sentence this issue  weÃ¢ÂÂre talking about today. So what will you do, should you become Prime Minister, about this? Tell us what  you will do.

TON Y ABBOTT:

IÃ¢ÂÂm not going to just off the top of my head, as it were Leon, declare that weÃ¢ÂÂre not going to have future  foreign investment, we need foreign investment -

LEON BYRNER:

I donÃ¢ÂÂt think anybodyÃ¢ÂÂs asking that.

TONY ABBOTT:

And the reason why we need foreign investment is because the current GovernmentÃ¢ÂÂs spending spree has  turned a $20 billion surplus into a $57 billion deficit and thatÃ¢ÂÂs got to be funded, Leon.

LEON BYNER:

I understand, but, you know, the rub here is that you have got sovereign countries, coming in, buying up  assets for bolstering their bio-security. That is a different issue.

3

TONY ABBOTT:

And we wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt, as a Coalition, we donÃ¢ÂÂt believe in the Australian Government nationalising Australian  assets under normal circumstances, so if we donÃ¢ÂÂt want the Australian Government nationalising Australian  businesses, the last thing we want are foreign governments taking over Australian businesses.

LEON BYNER:

So what will you do?

TONY ABBOTT:

And when there was that proposal from the Chinese to take over very significant parts of Rio, we opposed  that, but itÃ¢ÂÂs got to be dealt with on a case by case basis, Leon.

LEON BYNER:

I understand. Now, Nick Xenophon has sent me a message to say he will introduce a Private Members Bill  in the next sitting of Parliament that will give the Foreign Investment Review Board the power to block any  and all purchases by both private and government owned foreign entities if they are not deemed to be in the  national interest. Will you support that Bill?

TONY ABBOTT:

I havenÃ¢ÂÂt seen the detail and weÃ¢ÂÂd want to look at the valuation to which this would apply, because at the  moment, my understanding is that the Foreign Investment Review Board does review all purchases by  sovereign wealth funds, all purchases by foreign government owned entities and it reviews all other  purchase if the value of the purchase is over US$100 or thereabouts, so weÃ¢ÂÂve already got a process in place.  IÃ¢ÂÂm happy to look at extending and improving, refining that process and IÃ¢ÂÂd be happy to look at the  Xenophon Bill.

LEON BYNER:

Now, just before we move onto another issue. Australians are concerned that growing our own food is very  important to our sustainability and both you and Ms Gillard have got presumably, a population policy. For  and water are fundamental to that. So, I donÃ¢ÂÂt see how you can have a debate on those things without this  being included. ItÃ¢ÂÂs got to be part of it, surely.

TONY ABBOTT:

True, Leon. But there is no current suggestion that any time soon, Australia is going to suffer food shortages.

LEON BYNER:

No, but that doesnÃ¢ÂÂt mean, you have to plan for the long term. Not just for the next three years.

TONY ABBOTT:

True enough, but if you look at the marvellous work that Australian farmers have done ever since 1788,  every year their production has gone up in terms of volume and in terms of value and I have no reason to  think that wonÃ¢ÂÂt continue in the years ahead.

LEON BYNER:

4

One of the reasons grocery prices, we are told, are higher in Australia, and do you acknowledge that? Than  they are in most other developed countries, that food inflation is higher, do you acknowledge that?

TONY ABBOTT:

In recent times, that seems to be the case, yeah.

LEON BYNER:

Ok, a lot of this is to do with the duopoly that has a massive market share, who can use imports to leverage  growers down as to what they will be getting at the farm gate. What will you do to ensure thatÃ¢ÂÂs fairer?

TONY ABBOTT:

Again, Leon, we have this body called the ACCC, the Competition and Consumer Commission, which is  suppose to make sure that gauging doesnÃ¢ÂÂt take place, which is suppose to make sure that oligopolies donÃ¢ÂÂt  develop and effectively collude against the public, so IÃ¢ÂÂd want to be satisfied that the ACCC is doing its job  properly. A lot of people -

LEON BYNER:

Can you make a judgement on that now?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, itÃ¢ÂÂs very hard to make a judgement in Opposition, when you donÃ¢ÂÂt have the same capacity to talk to  these people and, as it were, assure yourself from their answers that they are on the job as opposed to asleep  at the wheel.

LEON BYNER:

So youÃ¢ÂÂll have to get into government, youÃ¢ÂÂre saying, before you come up with a policy, you canÃ¢ÂÂt tell the  electorate before?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, our policy is to ensure that we have strong regulators, powerful watchdogs to make sure that the public  are not being ripped off.

LEON BYNER:

Andrew, good morning, youÃ¢ÂÂre talking with Tony Abbott.

CALLER:

Yeah, good morning, how are you?

LEON BYNER:

Good.

TONY ABBOTT:

Good, Andrew.

CALLER:

5

Yeah, good morning. Just on the boat people saga, you know, we get a lot of lip service from both parties in  relation to the boat people, why not just someone stand up and stop holding the ball and just say these  people smugglers, life imprisonment, if you bring them over, the captain, life imprisonment and we all, we  wonÃ¢ÂÂt get anymore boats. Pretty simple.

TONY ABBOTT:

ThatÃ¢ÂÂs a fair point, Andrew. You know, the Howard Government did stop the boats and the next Coalition  Government will do the same thing.

LEON BYNER:

ThereÃ¢ÂÂs only one little curly in this. We find today that the boats are being scuttled by their crews and then  they wire us that theyÃ¢ÂÂre in an emergency, as humanitarians we help them, so then that means that the people  smugglers who did this, do not get judged as people smugglers.

TONY ABBOTT:

ThatÃ¢ÂÂs a very fair point Leon and this is why you need a range of tough policies if you are going to stop this  horrible business and youÃ¢ÂÂve got to deny the people smugglers a product to sell.

LEON BYNER:

How will you stop the boats? What will you do?

TONY ABBOTT:

Three things, essentially. Temporary protection visas, so that people smugglers donÃ¢ÂÂt have a product to sell.  Rigorous offshore processing, so the boat people, as far as possible, donÃ¢ÂÂt get to Australia. And that means  picking up the phone to the President of Nauru straight away. And third, where you can do it safely, and  thereÃ¢ÂÂll be many circumstances where you canÃ¢ÂÂt, but where you can do it safely thereÃ¢ÂÂs got to be the option  of turning boats around.

LEON BYNER:

Ok, Peter, good morning.

CALLER:

Good morning.

LEON BYNER:

Yes. YouÃ¢ÂÂre talking with Tony Abbott.

CALLER:

Good morning Mr Abbott. Look, IÃ¢ÂÂm calling because I had a question about this broadband issue. To me,  itÃ¢ÂÂs a big concern. I mean, my understanding from what IÃ¢ÂÂve read is that weÃ¢ÂÂre going to spend, at the  moment, about $44 billion on this thing, thatÃ¢ÂÂs the quote at the moment. It seems like a hell of a lot of  money to me, and could be even more. I mean, are we going to, how long is it going to take for this thing to  roll out, and is it really going to be worth it?

TONY ABBOTT:

6



Peter, these are all very good questions. And youÃ¢ÂÂre right, the current Government is proposing to spend  something like $43 billion, maybe more, and it will be a government-owned monopoly. And, letÃ¢ÂÂs face it,  this is a Government which couldnÃ¢ÂÂt safely put pink batts into peopleÃ¢ÂÂs roofs, couldnÃ¢ÂÂt efficiently deliver  school halls on a value for money basis. And the idea that this Government, which has been chaotic and  incompetent in small things, or relatively small things, will be efficient and get value for money in big things  just doesnÃ¢ÂÂt add up.

LEON BYNER:

Tony, what is your broadband policy? Because ultimately you can give the broadband authority money to do  things, but they wonÃ¢ÂÂt be delivering it. TheyÃ¢ÂÂll go out to Telstra or Optus or another company that does.

TONY ABBOTT:

ThatÃ¢ÂÂs right. And, Leon, weÃ¢ÂÂll be announcing a broadband policy in the course of the campaign. But it will  not be based on a nationalised monopoly provider. It will be based on competition between private sector  entities.

LEON BYNER:

The only problem is that when you want businesses to roll out something, they want a return.

TONY ABBOTT:

ThatÃ¢ÂÂs correct.

LEON BYNER:

Whereas when the government does it, itÃ¢ÂÂs got a different agenda in mind. So, what do you say to this?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, this Government wants to have it both ways. On the one hand they say that the National Broadband  Network wonÃ¢ÂÂt need to make a significant profit. On the other hand it says Ã¢ÂÂwell, we need investors in this.Ã¢ÂÂ  So, they donÃ¢ÂÂt know exactly what theyÃ¢ÂÂre doing here. And they say that weÃ¢ÂÂll be operating on a commercial  basis to the investors, but to the public theyÃ¢ÂÂre saying Ã¢ÂÂweÃ¢ÂÂre going to do it very cheaply.Ã¢ÂÂ Well, it just  doesnÃ¢ÂÂt add up.

LEON BYNER:

WeÃ¢ÂÂre talking with the Federal Opposition Leader, Tony Abbott. 8223 0000.

[Commercial break]

Talking to Tony Abbott, the Opposition Leader. Tony, right now, FSANZ and Biosecurity, AQIS, have  allowed in the importation of apples from China, even though on a European website which represents  countries of the European economic community there is a high alert for suzuki fly, which can get into  bruised fruit. Now, the Government have basically done little about this, except thereÃ¢ÂÂs an inquiry about  labelling. What will you do?

TONY ABBOTT:

7

Well, obviously this has been a complete disaster. They were warned about this problem of suzuki fly, and  they gave the permission for the imports. And only after theyÃ¢ÂÂd given the permission have they done the  study. Now, thatÃ¢ÂÂs a grotesquely unsatisfactory situation, and IÃ¢ÂÂm no expert on our quarantine laws, but it  seems to me that weÃ¢ÂÂve got to have another look at this.

LEON BYNER:

What does that mean?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I donÃ¢ÂÂt know what the legal issues are with just saying we put a stop on it here and now. IÃ¢ÂÂd want to  get advice on that. But plainly the advice that the Government should have got before it gave permission itÃ¢ÂÂs  only getting after it gave permission.

LEON BYNER:

Well, it would argue it didnÃ¢ÂÂt give permission that these statutory authorities did. But ultimately, remember,  one of the issues in this campaign, and Laurie Oakes has been calling you and Julia pygmies, and your  teams, because you wonÃ¢ÂÂt stand up and take responsibility for policy. Alright. So, it just, it seems strange to  me that you have these independent authorities going against the very spirit of what the federal government  is trying to do, and that is get some decent food labelling up.

TONY ABBOTT:

And plainly, Leon, if the Government through its agencies or instrumentalities, or through its ministers, has  done something which flies in the face of common sense, we should stop that and start again.

LEON BYNER:

Alright, letÃ¢ÂÂs talk to Gabriel. Gabriel, youÃ¢ÂÂre talking with Tony Abbott.

CALLER:

Good morning Leon, good morning Tony. How are you going?

TONY ABBOTT:

Not too bad.

CALLER:

The Senate had a, in the Senate, [inaudible] was talking about a new superannuation with ACTU, military  superannuation and the finance minister appointing five representatives to run Australian superannuation. Is  it the Rudd Labor GovernmentÃ¢ÂÂs policy now, or whatever she is, policy to put the ACTU involved into a  superannuation fund, and how are you going to stop it?

TONY ABBOTT:

My understanding, Gabriel, is that the Government is proposing to have the same board run military  superannuation as runs other superannuation, and we donÃ¢ÂÂt support this policy. WeÃ¢ÂÂre going to keep a  separate board to look after the military superannuation because we think that the entitlements of our  military should be looked at quite separately from other entitlements, given the level of service that our  miliary personnel put in. I might as well remind you, Gabriel, that we have promised to change the

8

indexation of Defence Force pensions; those that were only indexed in accordance with CPI, to change that  to the same indexation that other pensions get, which will be a much better deal for our ex-service personnel.

LEON BYNER:

Hi Julie. YouÃ¢ÂÂre talking with Tony Abbott.

CALLER:

Good morning. Tony, the Australian Government-owned institution that was privatised by the Howard  Government a few years ago, Telstra; ever since, TelstraÃ¢ÂÂs been hiving off Australian jobs overseas. In fact,  South Australian jobs have been lost to the Philippines. My own husband has lost his job a few weeks ago,  working in a call centre in Adelaide. What will the Liberal government do that the Labor Government will  not do in terms of making sure these jobs are actually retained on the Australian shores for Australian  people?

TONY ABBOTT:

We arenÃ¢ÂÂt going to [inaudible] Telstra and we canÃ¢ÂÂt and shouldnÃ¢ÂÂt renationalise Telstra. But if weÃ¢ÂÂve got a  strong and dynamic economy here, (a) hopefully these companies will want to use well-trained Australian  workers to -

LEON BYNER:

Tony, thatÃ¢ÂÂs not going to happen because you know as well as I do, the reason for this is that they can  employ people for less money doing the same job. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs what itÃ¢ÂÂs about. DoesnÃ¢ÂÂt matter how well trained  they are. They even bring them in and watch football and pretend theyÃ¢ÂÂre local when theyÃ¢ÂÂre not. I guess  what JulieÃ¢ÂÂs asking, do you have any levers at your disposal, were you Prime Minister, to do anything about  this?

TONY ABBOTT:

What I canÃ¢ÂÂt do, Leon, is to produce a command economy where everything is done at the behest of  government rather than at the behest of people out there in the market who are trying to make the best living  they can for themselves. We have a market economy. Generally speaking, thatÃ¢ÂÂs a good thing, not a bad  thing. In a market economy, sometimes to produce the best possible services at the lowest possible price,  businesses will try to source some of their inputs from overseas. Now thatÃ¢ÂÂs not a bad thing, thatÃ¢ÂÂs a good  thing, by and large. Sometimes it has unfortunate consequences for people and if weÃ¢ÂÂve got a dynamic  economy, if you lose your job in a call centre, thereÃ¢ÂÂll be other jobs that you can go to that will hopefully be  better jobs than the one you had in the call centre.

LEON BYNER:

That doesnÃ¢ÂÂt really save the problem.

TONY ABBOTT:

There are many problems Leon, which people would like government to fix for them. We canÃ¢ÂÂt fix all  problems and part of the job of government is to…

LEON BYNER:

You know what part of the key here is? Fair trade. Not free trade but fair trade. Because you know and I  know that weÃ¢ÂÂve got people agriculturally, for example and there are many others, who have a 30 to one

9

labour disadvantage because the costs in countries like China, occupational health and safety and those  things, are bare skeletons to what they are here in Australia. We compete well, but weÃ¢ÂÂre asking more of  them and more of them, and theyÃ¢ÂÂre coming to breaking point. WeÃ¢ÂÂve got one final question for you. Are  you not enraged, or should you not be, that the independent authority that is supposed to be coming up with  a blueprint for our water, is not going to give us what it is until after the election? IÃ¢ÂÂve not heard anybody  from your side put their hand up and say, Ã¢ÂÂthis is outrageousÃ¢ÂÂ.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well IÃ¢ÂÂm happy to say that Leon. And if the Government hadnÃ¢ÂÂt dragged the chain in terms of everything to  do with the Murray-Darling, this blueprint would be well and truly out by now. Senator Wong has basically  procrastinated on everything to do with the Murray-Darling Basin which is why the good plan which the  Howard Government put in place is still not being implemented the way it ought to be. WeÃ¢ÂÂve got billions of  dollars thatÃ¢ÂÂs available to improve infrastructure, to intelligently buy back water, to help the environmental  health of the river and itÃ¢ÂÂs not happening because this Government basically has got bogged down in endless  dialogue with the state Labor governments who are the masters of disaster at everything.

LEON BYNER:

Thank you for coming in. I think the public are going to want a little more from you on biosecurity issues. I  know you couldnÃ¢ÂÂt make a decision on the run today, nor did Joe Hockey. But I think they need to be  convinced that a Coalition government has biosecurity and food production at the very centre of their focus  of sustainability.

TONY ABBOTT:

ThatÃ¢ÂÂs a very fair point Leon. As I said, if this Government has put at risk Australian agriculture by allowing  unsafe products to be imported to Australia, obviously weÃ¢ÂÂll change that.

LEON BYNER:

Ok. Thanks for coming in.

TONY ABBOTT:

Thanks.

LEON BYNER:

Tony Abbott, Leader of the Opposition on 5AA.
