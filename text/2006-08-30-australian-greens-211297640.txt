Kerry Nettle, Senator for New South Wales





Greens condemn change of attitude toward Removal  Pending Bridging Visa

Senator Nettle, 30th August 2006

Australian Greens Senator Kerry Nettle today condemned the attempted deportation  of Bangladeshi man to India.

"Following the failure of the latest migration legislation, the government appears to be  returning to a hardline approach on asylum seekers," said Senator Nettle.

"On the day the legislation was withdrawn, the Minister announced she was sending  asylum seekers to Nauru for the first time in 4 years.

"The Greens believe this is the first attempt to deport someone holding a Removal  Pending Bridging Visa and represents a change of attitude toward this visa class.

"It is disturbing that the planned deportation was to India, when this man is from  Bangladesh. Is this the "deport and dump" attitude of old resurfacing?

"The Minister must explain why her department is trying to deport a Bangladeshi man  to India. Does she need a geography lesson?

"There has been enough stuff-ups with deportations in the past, with the cases of  Vivian Solon and Robert Jovicic, and the reports of the deaths of deported Afghan  asylum seekers.

"The removal pending bridging visa was an ad hoc fix to take the pressure of the  government over the long-term detention of asylum seekers. It allowed these people to  be released into the community without the government losing face.

"Former long-term detainees now on RPBVs, many who are stateless such as Peter  Qasim, may well be facing imminent deportation with the apparent change of attitude  toward this visa class.
