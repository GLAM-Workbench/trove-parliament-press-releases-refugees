THE HON RICHARD MARLES MP  SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND BORDER  PROTECTION  MEMBER FOR CORIO



E&OE TRANSCRIPT  TELEVISION INTERVIEW  SKY NEWS AM AGENDA  WEDNESDAY, 17 DECEMBER 2014

SUBJECT/S: Sydney Siege.

KIERAN GILBERT: With me now Liberal Senator Zed Seselja and Shadow Immigration  Minister Richard Marles. Richard first to you for your reaction over the tragic events of  the last 24-48 hours and the response from authorities.

RICHARD MARLES, SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND BORDER  PROTECTION: Well this has just been an appalling event and it’s one which has put  Australia into the global spotlight. I think it’s an event which is aimed to divide us and to  bring out the worst in us but what I think has been, you know, something that’s good  that’s come from it is if you look at that growing floral tribute in Martin Place, it’s actually  bringing out the best in Australia and I think you see a nation coming together and that  is a really, really great thing and it’s so important that we do that. It’s so important that  we rally around the families of Tori Johnson and Katrina Dawson and of course all of  those who were caught up in the siege which could have happened to any of us, just  before coming on air today I had a coffee downstairs here at Southbank in Melbourne  and really I was doing precisely the same thing as they were doing 48 hours ago in  Martin Place and I think every Australian can empathise with this and for that reason  and it’s so important that we rally around those people now.

GILBERT: Indeed and there are of course the questions that need to be answered as  well as we move forward in a security sense, Richard Marles I guess the question as  Immigration spokesman I put to you and this is something that has been raised by  including by one of your fellow Labor MPs the question around immigration and  character checks and so on, are there any implications that you can see at this very  early stage of course when things remain raw to say the least.

MARLES: Well it is an early stage and it’s important that we don’t rush to hasty  judgements, there is a robust system of processing people and assessing people’s  refugee claims, that said we can always look at ways in which our system can be better  and actually I think the Prime Minister’s comments were correct when he said we can  always be better at what we do and it is important that there is a review of this and it is  important that we look at the circumstances surrounding this man and how he could be

in the position that he was and that we learn every lesson that can possibly be learnt  from this.  But having said that, I think at this early stage our thoughts and our attention  really must remain with the hostages and the victims of this siege and their families and  to make sure that as a country we respond to this in a unified way, that we come  together, that we stand up against intolerance and that we see this as an event which  unites us rather than dividing us because that is what was its intent.

GILBERT: Mike Baird yesterday Zed Seselja I think characterised is so well when he  said that that memorial, that makeshift memorial of flowers was like the beating heart of  the city, he handled that so well and obviously a tough awful day for his city and his  state.

SESELJA: Yeah look and I think this is the time, you know, when leaders need to be at  the forefront in I guess comforting a community but what we are seeing is a community  responding to these tragic events, responding in a very own way in expressing our

sympathies for the victims, expressing our solidarity, not just with their families but of  course those who were caught up, I mean there are two tragic deaths here but also  there are many people who are damaged who will be damaged by what would have  been an amazingly traumatic event so I think the response is one that we would expect  from Australians we do come together in these circumstances, it’s legitimate that we not  only send our thoughts and our prayers and our condolences to the families but of  course we look to learn the lessons from this tragic incident.

GILBERT: Indeed.  Richard Marles, terror experts and international affairs, intelligence  analysts, they agree that this sort of individual, this warped person is the sort of  character that is attracted to the warped ideology of the likes of IS and their likeminded  organisations that’s what we’re dealing with here isn’t it? You can talk that one crazed  gunman but that is the sort of individual that is attracted to the warped ideology of those  groups?

MARLES: I think that’s right Kieran and what IS has done is take the stage of global  terrorism to a new place one which is much more brutal than we’ve seen, brutality is  really the way in which IS goes about its business then appeals to others to engage in  that kind of raw brutality and as Dan Tehan said, David Irvine has warned us of this kind  of lone wolf attack and it does mean that there is a new challenge that our authorities  have to respond to just as they responded to new challenges in the aftermath of  September 11 and it is important that as a nation we get on top of that, that said, we do  have amongst the best intelligence organisations in the world, we have amongst the  best law enforcement agencies in the world and when you look at the way in which they  responded to this crisis you can only take your hat off to their incredible professionalism

and we are being kept as safe as it is possible for us to be kept by virtue of the  professionalism of our authorities and there is a sense obviously in the light of what’s  occurred in the last couple of days that our world does seem a little less safe than it did  on Sunday but we should take some comfort from the fact that we have amongst the  most professional law enforcement and security agencies in the world.

GILBERT: Yeah exactly and long may that be the case. Senator Seselja on the issue of  the perversion of Islam that this person used to justify his atrocity, obviously we have  seen the group of Islamic community come out and condemn it, how important is it that  that continues, that that engagement continues with the moderate, the vast bulk of  moderate Islamic followers in this country?

SESELJA: Oh look there’s no doubt that it’s critically important because you know we  rightly expect that Muslim leaders amongst others will be horrified and will condemn  these kinds of attacks and these kind of atrocities but it’s of course important because  we don’t want to see radicalised youth in this country and unfortunately, of course we’re  not talking youth in this particular case, but we don’t want to see a radicalised element  in Australia, we know unfortunately that there are a small proportion who are  radicalised, we know that some have gone overseas to fight, we know that some intend  to do us harm here, can I in echoing what Richard said in terms of our intelligence  agencies I think that’s important to empathise the quality of our intelligence agencies but  I think also to acknowledge the great challenge that we face with this kind of attack, it is  a very very difficult thing for any agency to be able to guard against when you have one  individual who goes and takes these actions perhaps with no coordination with anyone  else, that is the great challenge that is faced right now and I think that’s why it’s so  important that we are always looking at ways we can better equip ASIO and our  intelligence agencies and give them the best possible framework to deal with these kind  of things.



GILBERT: Gentlemen unfortunately we’re out of time this morning but thanks for your  contribution this morning and throughout the year, I wish you both a safe Christmas and  new year.
