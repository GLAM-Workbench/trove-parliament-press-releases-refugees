Australia will provide $200.000 for flood victims in southern Malawi, the  Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Gareth Evans announced  today.

Heavy rains since February have caused major flooding in southern Malawi,  washing away homes and inundating maize, cotton and groundnut crops.

"Throughout the affected area over 85,000 people are homeless and have  lost their crops, personal effects and livestock," Senator Evans said.

Senator Evans said Malawi could not afford to meet the costs of this major  disaster alone and was already bearing a very large burden caring for an  estimated 900,000 Mozambiquan refugees who have sought refuge inside its  borders.

Australia's contribution follows an appeal for assistance from the Government  of Malawi. World Vision Australia's Malawi counterpart will receive $100,000  to provide clothing, cooking utensils, blankets and plastic sheeting.

Australian Freedom from Hunger Campaign will receive $100,000 to  rehabilite existing water bore holes in Nsanje District

Australian emergency assistance to Malawi forms part of the Government's  aid program administered by the Australian International Development  Assistance Bureau (AIDAB), Canberra.
