TRANSCRIPT  THE HON JOE HOCKEY MP

SHADOW TREASURER

774 ABC MELBOURNE  JON FAINE  THURSDAY 1 SEPTEMBER 2011





E&OE………………………………………………………………………………………

JON FAINE:

Joe Hockey is Shadow Treasurer and right hand man to Tony Abbott, Prime Minister in  waiting. Joe Hockey, good morning to you.

JOE HOCKEY:

Morning Jon.

JON FAINE:

What do you think should be done now after the High Court decision yesterday?

JOE HOCKEY:

The Government should immediately contact the Government of Nauru. Ask them if they  can open the centre, reintroduce temporary protection visas and then get on with the job of  processing the applications for those people who are seeking refugee status in Australia.

JON FAINE:

How does that solve the problem of people smugglers?

JOE HOCKEY:

Well what it does is slow down the boats, it stops the boats in the end. And it does not  guarantee passage to Australia.



JON FAINE:

Do you think that Australia should take a more compassionate or a less compassionate  approach?

JOE HOCKEY:

What I’ve just suggested is the most compassionate approach.

JON FAINE:

In what way? There was nothing compassionate about the Nauru solution last time around.

JOE HOCKEY:

Yeah I think there was because it stops the boats and I think the most compassionate thing  you can do is stop the boats. For people to be so desperate that they get on a rickety boat and  travel hundreds, maybe thousands of kilometres across the sea. We saw the tragedy on the  shores of Christmas Island and I think we were all appalled at that. So the best thing that can  be done is to stop the boats. We have a proven formula that stops the boats. The Government  has now got to swallow its pride and undertake that.

JON FAINE:

Do you accept that people have legitimate reasons for wanting to seek refuge and trying to  find a new life in Australia?

JOE HOCKEY:

Oh of course. Of course. And look -

JON FAINE:

Your own refugee [inaudible] - how many generations back did the Hockeys flee Armenia?

JOE HOCKEY:

My father - well in Armenia it was two generations ago but my father came in 1948 and  there’s a whole lot of people in Melbourne who came in 1948 and the early 1950’s. And I  employ a young woman that came on a boat from Vietnam in the late 70’s and was in a  hellhole of a refugee camp in Hong Kong.

JON FAINE:

Well why don’t you take more people then?

JOE HOCKEY:

Well we do. We take 13 and a half thousand which is on a per capita basis I think the highest

or second highest in the world. And that’s good. But this Government has just completely  bungled this unbelievably.

JON FAINE:

Well they tried Timor, that was the first option.

JOE HOCKEY:

And that failed.

JON FAINE:

And then Malaysia.

JOE HOCKEY:

And that failed. But also they had the freeze on asylum seekers, remember that? And people  were having their applications frozen, and that failed, and its all because they don’t know  how to govern. This is a government that does not know how to govern the country. Whether  it be pink batts, school halls, live cattle exports, it just goes on and on, and there’s a point,  we’re dealing with human beings. I’ve been on your show before and expressed my outrage  about Malaysia, primarily from a humanitarian perspective, and that is because human beings  are not football cards. You know, you don’t swap them. And that’s what Julia Gillard and her  Government tried to do. Treat human beings like football cards. We’ll give you 800, you give  us 4000. Well now we find we’re receiving 4000, its going to cost us $200 million to receive  those 4000, plus our reputation in the region is in tatters because not only did we insult the  East Timorese by not asking them about the East Timor solution, not only did we offend the  Papua New Guineans by saying we’re going to reopen Manus without getting Government  approval from them, not only did we stop food supplies to Indonesia overnight, but we’ve  now entered into a deal with Malaysia and the Government has acted ultra vires - it’s actually  acted beyond its powers. How extraordinarily embarrassing for us.

JON FAINE:

Where does the buck stop?

JOE HOCKEY:

Well Julia Gillard. She’s the Prime Minister, and she said she was going to put the business  case of people smugglers in the bin, she said she was going to stop the boats. She said one of  the reasons why she politically executed Kevin Rudd was because she wanted to have a

solution to stop the boats. Well her solution has failed.

JON FAINE:



This is what happens in my view if you try to contrive a set of solutions through unnavigable  waters. You have to try and steer a path between completely different, competing mutually  exclusive, almost, sets of values and objectives. You want to satisfy the Greens and the left of

your own party and at the same time you’ve got people in particular in Western Australia and  Queensland who politically -

JOE HOCKEY:

And what about David Bradbury the member for Western Sydney who went up to Darwin  and stood on a boat with Julia Gillard and said “We’re going to stop the boats”? He had no  relationship at all with the issue, but its pure political panic.

JON FAINE:

My point is if Tony Abbott and your side, going back to your football analogy if your team  had managed to persuade the cross benchers to install you, you would have been navigating  exactly the same perilous waters looking for solutions for yourselves as well.

JOE HOCKEY:

No, East Timor came up as a solution for Julia Gillard before the election. Before the  election.

JON FAINE:

You would have still needed to rely on crossbench and Green support to come up with  solutions through the Parliament.

JOE HOCKEY:

No I actually don’t think the Nauru solution needs any further legislation. I don’t think it  does. I don’t know about Temporary Protection Visas, I’m not going to speak on the run, but  I’m pretty sure Nauru does not need any additional legislation.

JON FAINE:

Well let’s move onto other things as well, this week in fact this morning we’ve seen trade  union leaders addressing workers in Port Kembla over the industrial relations and job issues  to do with industry protection, job losses in the steel industry, and calls from Paul Howes and  other trade union leaders for some sort of manufacturing meeting or inquiry or some sort of a  review of exactly the impact of the high Aussie dollar and the mining boom on  manufacturing and other jobs. You’re Shadow Treasurer; do you think an inquiry would be  worthwhile and useful?

JOE HOCKEY:

Well from my perspective, I don’t think it’s bad to get these issues out in the open. I can’t  help but think that Paul Howes is a latter-day advocate on this issue, he’s been pretty quiet  about it for some period of time and he’s been more focused on climate change and a range of

other things than he has been on the interest of his workers. But having said that this is a  challenge and it is in part the high Australian dollar which I think we’re going to have to live  with for a long period of time.

JON FAINE:

And that’s the mining boom.

JOE HOCKEY:

It is partly the mining boom, it’s a range of things. Australia is seen as a safe haven at the  moment for foreign investment. I’m not discounting the mining boom but there’s a range of  factors, and it is also the fact that the US dollar is very weak, the Euro is pretty flat to weak,  and people have to put their money into things. And we’ve seen a lot of sovereign wealth  come into Australia over the last few months. Having said all of that I think it is important  that we don’t let manufacturing decline markedly in Australia.

JON FAINE:

And how do you do that?

JOE HOCKEY:

Well the best way to do it is to look at ways we can help to restructure the industry and make  it more productive.

JON FAINE:

What does restructure and productive actually mean?

JOE HOCKEY:

Well that’s very much in the hands of the operators in the industry -

JON FAINE:

You’re talking about industrial relations reform?

JOE HOCKEY:

I’m talking about flexibility, I’m talking about a whole range of different things.

JON FAINE:

Industrial relations reform, John Howard the other night on 7:30 with Chris Ulhmann said he  though the Government has dropped the ball on improvements in the industrial relations field,  how far will you and Tony Abbott go?

JOE HOCKEY:

Well you’ll see our policy before the election in full detail. But what I can say to you is that  the issue of industrial relations has been raised by business, its been raised by the Governor  of the Reserve Bank now on numerous occasions as one of the reasons why inflation is  starting to get away, and last night here in Melbourne I was at a dinner and two builders

raised it with me, one said that his costs of construction in Melbourne are now 30% higher  than anywhere else in Australia because of union activity.

JON FAINE:

What sort of union activity?

JOE HOCKEY:

Well I don’t want to disclose who they are -

JON FAINE:

Well that is part of the problem actually.

JOE HOCKEY:

Well it is part of the problem. Because -

JON FAINE:

The connection between bikie gangs, organized crime and the building and construction  unions is one which requires some serious consideration.

JOE HOCKEY:



Well we need a strong Australian building and construction commission and the Gillard  Government de-fanged the ABCC. I always thought that was going to have the most  profound impact here in Melbourne and in Victoria more generally than in any other part of  Australia. I’ve been proven right. But you’ll see our policy before the election.

JON FAINE:

But we want to know more about it too. If I was a key backer of the Liberal Party, or if I was  one of the foot soldiers of the Liberal Party I’d be saying to you and to Tony Abbott, “You’re  so far in front, this Government is just spiralling downwards in the polls, seize the  opportunity, be bold, say what you believe in, say what you stand up for and get out there and  do it.”

JOE HOCKEY:

Well we always say what we believe in.

JON FAINE:

But you also say what you think is palatable and what might get you elected. Ultimately  you’re politicians.

JOE HOCKEY:

Well hang on I always say what I believe in.

JON FAINE:

You temper what you say according to what you think may get you elected. Let’s not quibble  about that. How far do you go, though, in seizing the opportunity when you’re so far ahead in  the polls to implement the agenda?

JOE HOCKEY:

Well our agenda is to get Australia more productive, to get Australia more efficient, to live  within our means. Now productivity obviously means having a workplace that allows  workers to get the best return for the best effort. Now, Work Choices is dead, buried,  cremated. Now for example I was the Minister for Workplace Relations in the last twelve  months of the Howard Government. And with John Howard, convinced him to reintroduce,  effectively, the no disadvantage test. That was one of the great mistakes of Work Choices,  taking away the no disadvantage test. So there was the potential that workers would be worse  off. Now WorkChoices is dead - it is, but what you have to do is ensure that our workplace is  not so affected by industrial action, so affected by industrial action that Australia comes to a  gridlock and it costs jobs. Now businesses need to stand up, you’re absolutely right.

JON FAINE:

Five minutes to nine, Joe Hockey, Shadow Treasurer, my guest in the studio.

[Update]

JON FAINE:

Joe Hockey in the studio this morning, when you are this far in front and you’re starting to  see that there is an election coming up and the Government is in an impossible position and  the Opposition, all you have to do is not stuff up in order to get elected.

JOE HOCKEY:

No I don’t accept that, I think good policy leads to good politics. And we’ve just seen a  classic example of that with the Malaysia people swap.

JON FAINE:

But you will also be having people who will be tempting you to what could easily become  overreach again on industrial relations - [inaudible] relations nothing would be better from  the trade unions point of view than to drag you into a debate about IR.

JOE HOCKEY:

Tony Abbott and myself as former workplace relations ministers know WorkChoices got it  wrong, went too far, we are very aware of that.



JON FAINE:

But you still want to pursue efficiencies and you want to reduce the cost of labour to  business.

JOE HOCKEY:

No, we want to make it more efficient. We want to have an efficient workforce. And that  means, you know under us, real wages increased by more than 20%. The problem at the  moment is that inflation is eating away at wage increases and therefore we cannot afford to

have stupid industrial action in Australia that undermines our productive workforce,  otherwise it does cost jobs.

JON FAINE:

Are there examples of industrial action that are something other than stupid in your mind?

JOE HOCKEY:

I think there is always a legitimate right to have industrial action particularly over  occupational health and safety issues.

JON FAINE:

And on wages and conditions?

JOE HOCKEY:

Yeah, as a last resort. But I’m not going to give a policy on the run. What I’m going to say to  you is that fairness must be a part of our industrial policy and fairness is on both sides.

JON FAINE:

What is the Liberal Party’s policy on protection for Australia industry? Paul Kelly wrote a  terrific comment piece in the Australian on Tuesday saying that Tony Abbott has intensified  doubts about his economic credentials and policy beliefs and he’s being accused of hypocrisy  trying to have a bet each way by your critics on the other side.

JOE HOCKEY:

Look, Australia has a bipartisan policy on free trade because we produce far more than we  consume and we need to have open markets globally to get our produce away. Now it doesn’t  mean you’re not going to have adjustment packages, I mean for crying out loud, I was part of  a Howard Government that had dairy industry adjustment packages, motor vehicle  adjustment packages, textile, clothing and footwear adjustment packages and so on. Tourism  adjustment packages. And you do have those, and I think there is bipartisan support for those  sorts of packages that help the transition of business. But we are believers in free and fair and  open trade.

JON FAINE:

But at the same time you are also trying to appeal to people and win votes from people  whose jobs are at risk through that exposure.

JOE HOCKEY:

Well I think people who have jobs at risk need to be reassured that we can compete with the  rest of the world. And that comes down to a whole lot of factors. But you know there’s been a  big focus on the steel industry, but there have been six or seven islands in the Barrier Reef  that have closed down over the last 12 months, virtually permanently. And that has had a big  impact on the Australian tourism industry, which is worth about $20 billion a year in exports.

So that’s been lost in part of the debate. So we are facing it across a whole lot of industries,  look at what retail is going through at the moment. And therefore we, as I said at the Press  Club after the last Budget, we need to grease the wheels of transformation and not leave  people behind and we can do it, we’ve done it before.

JON FAINE:

And then if you put all of that together, you believe in a little bit of protection but not a lot, a  little bit of industrial relations reform, but not a lot, and we start to wonder what sort of an  Abbott Government it might be by the time we go to the polls.

JOE HOCKEY:

I’ll tell you what it will be, it’ll be a stable, consistent Government that gives people  confidence that they can go out and take risk in their everyday lives to make money, to be  successful, without having the Government come along and increase taxes and regulate their  lives.

JON FAINE:

Well talking of taxes, that raises another whole, we didn’t talk about climate change we  didn’t talk have the carbon tax, for once we managed to talk about other things. Have fun  with Richmond Football Club, Joe Hockey, great to have you here and thanks for answering  so many questions this morning.

JOE HOCKEY:

Anytime, Jon.
