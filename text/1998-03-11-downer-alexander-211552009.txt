AUSTRALIAN 
AID FOR PALESTINIAN REFUGEES

Â

I am pleased to announce Australia has allocated 
a total of $718,000 to assist Palestinian refugees through small business 
loans and the provision of better health services.

Â

There are about 3.4 million refugees registered with 
the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees 
in the Near East, (UNWRA).

Â

The Australian Government is providing $355,000 to 
AUSTCARE to support two micro-credit schemes implemented by UNRWA in 
an effort to alleviate poverty, increase employment opportunities, and 
promote the growth of businesses in the Gaza Strip.

Â

Over 850 people, a large proportion of them women, 
will receive loans to help them establish small-scale enterprises. Since 
UNRWA introduced the two schemes in 1991, over $9.2 million has been 
provided in loans.

Â

World Vision Australia will also receive $363,000 
for the first year of a project which aims to ensure that Palestinian 
refugees in Lebanon have greater access to health care.

Â

The funds will be spent on training health workers, 
providing mobile clinics to visit refugee camps which receive no other 
support, coordinating sanitation, removing garbage, chlorinating water 
and, in addition, Australia has committed an additional $750,000 to 
continue humanitarian projects in the Occupied Palestinian Territories, 
which commenced last year.
