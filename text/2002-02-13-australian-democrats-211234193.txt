13 February 2002  MEDIA RELEASE                          02/057

CLOSE WOOMERA Democrats move amendment to reply to the GG’s opening address The Australian Democrats today sought Senate support for the closure of the Woomera Detention Centre.

Leader of the Australian Democrats, Senator Natasha Stott Despoja, moved an amendment to the motion in reply to the Governor-General’s address.

The Amendment reads: “That the Senate is of the opinion that the Government must move towards a more humane and workable approach to asylum seekers, and that the Woomera Detention Centre must be closed.”

Senator Stott Despoja and Democrats’ spokesperson for Immigration, Senator Andrew Bartlett, visited the Woomera Detention Centre in January this year.

“We urge the ALP to give serious consideration to supporting this amendment. This is an opportunity for the ALP to follow through on their commitment to a better approach to asylum seekers,” said Senator Bartlett.

A motion in reply to the Governor-General's address was last amended in1996 when it was agreed that it was the Senate's opinion that no part of Telstra be sold.

Senator Bartlett said it was unlikely that the amendment on asylum seekers would be voted on today.

Senator Bartlett also read to the Senate a transcript of what some of the asylum seekers from the centre told him and Senator Stott Despoja:

“Welcome as representatives of Australia. We wanted you to see with your own eyes. We are not criminals. We are people with problems.

Our message to the Australians is that we just want a little opportunity to renew our lives. We came here to seek asylum.

We don’t come to swallow Australia. We want to work, to contribute to this country.

There are misunderstandings about us among the Australian people.”
