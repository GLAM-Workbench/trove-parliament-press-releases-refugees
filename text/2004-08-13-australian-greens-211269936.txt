Terror laws attack democracy - Greens

Senator Kerry Nettle, 13th August 2004

The Greens condemn the Government and Labor for rushing new anti-terrorism laws  through Parliament today.

The Greens say the new laws breach human rights law, will criminalise the actions  ordinary Australian's and remove fundamental civil rights protections.

"We already have some of the most draconian terror laws in the world and today's bill  makes them worse.

"Under this new law anyone who has communicated with people connected to  organisations the government label terrorists could face three years jail.

"The millions of Australians who supported the ANC or the East Timorese freedom  struggle would have been caught by this bill.

"Journalists, community workers, extended family members and parliamentarians  could face charges under this legislation. This is guilt by association legislation and  should be rejected outright.

"Members of the Muslim community will be particularly affected. The only  organisations the government has banned are Muslim organisations.

"Other aspects of the laws will mean ASIO will be able to seize Australian's passports  without warrant and asylum seekers and refugees could be criminalised merely for  seeking asylum."
