11 April 2012

KIERAN GILBERT: With me now from Melbourne Labor front bencher Richard Marles  and from Adelaide Liberal MP Jamie Briggs.

Gentlemen thanks for being there. Jamie on the Howes' comments you've just heard there  about the debate on the RBA and the dollar, it’s fair enough at least to put forward these  proposals isn't it? It’s good to have a debate given we're seeing the manufacturing steel sector  struggle so much?

JAMIE BRIGGS: Well I thought part of it was quite hilarious. Paul Howes, of course, two  years ago thought he knew more than the Parliamentary Labor Party when he led the push to  get rid of Kevin Rudd, now he thinks he knows more than the Reserve Bank. Basically, what  Paul Howes is trying to create here is a straw man so his members today don't tear him apart  about his support for Julia Gillard’s carbon tax, because that’s the great - that is the great  guillotine hanging over the head of heavy manufacturing in Australia, just when they are  under pressure and everyone acknowledges that they are under pressure. There are structural  changes going on in the economy. Howes is supporting Julia Gillard and Richard Marles and  the Labor Party has pushed to install this reverse tariff on Australian industry to make it  impossible for the Australian steel and heavy manufacturing industries to compete with the  world’s leading carbon tax, the biggest carbon tax in the world, far outside what anyone else  is doing. Paul Howes should be addressing that, rather than trying to create straw men, as if  he knows more than Glen Stevens and the Reserve Bank about what they're doing in  monetary policy.

KIERAN GILBERT: Richard Marles what do you make of suggestions like the need to  have another look at the charter for the RBA to broaden its scope, do you think those ideas  have got merit?

RICHARD MARLES: First of all, Jamie’s comments make it completely clear that the  Opposition have totally missed the boat here, in terms of putting this on the carbon price. The  carbon price on aluminium, for example, is about the equivalent of a one cent movement in  the Australian dollar. The carbon price has been put on to aluminium and taken off it every  night with currency changes. What matters here is the rate of the Australian dollar and it is  right to have a conversation about that.

What we think in terms of the question about the Reserve Bank charter is that it’s not so  much a question of the charter but what we need to be doing to give the Reserve bank every  opportunity they can to reduce interest rates. The way we do that is by getting our budget  back into surplus which is why we're engaged in the biggest fiscal consolidation in Australian  history to see that that occurs.

And we're doing that I might say with the opposition of the Opposition as always…

JAMIE BRIGGS: [Laughs]…

RICHARD MARLES: … but what we need to see is the budget get back into surplus which  is what we're doing. Hard decisions, but that’s what will create the circumstances for interest  rates to be lowered by the Reserve Bank.

KIERAN GILBERT: And on this issue of the unions, as Paul Howes is trying to have this  debate, there is this ongoing issue about the credit card misuse within the HSU. This just  seems to be never ending Richard.

RICHARD MARLES: Well I heard what Paul Howes had to say about that and I  sympathise with a lot of what he had to say but I'd make two points. Firstly, there are two  pretty simple issues here. One is that independent authorities ought to be allowed to get on  with the business of doing what they do independently - being the Victoria Police, Fair Work  Australia and New South Wales Police, they need to get on with that business. It’s obviously  important to make it clear that union funds should be spent in the interest of union members.  That is an important point to make in the context of this debate. But, the other thing is that,  for all the attempts to make this a political issue, at the end of the day, when we're talking  about Craig Thomson, he’s entitled to a presumption of innocence. That is, in essence, a legal  process and it ought to be allowed to play out free from politics.

KIERAN GILBERT: Jamie Briggs that’s a fair point isn't it? When it comes to Craig  Thomson and when you look at the union movement more generally, they've been scathing  about these individuals within the HSU. Isn't it just a few isolated examples in this case?

JAMIE BRIGGS: Well it’s about time Julia Gillard was scathing about this as well. A few  isolated examples, come on. This is 77,000 of the lowest paid workers in our society who put  their money each week faithfully to this group of people, to these union bosses who have now  day by day been shown to have used these credit cards and other facilities for the most  outrageous expenses.

We hear so much about the Labor Party claiming to represent the working people in Australia  - well they don't, they represent the union bosses, they represent the excesses which are  going on in the union movement and that’s why you're seeing a lack of - the same sort of  language from Julia Gillard.

She refuses to disassociate herself from Craig Thomson for her own political benefit. It must  be extremely hard for people like Richard Marles who have represented working people  pretty much all their working lives, as one of those big union bosses, to sit there and watch  their reputation get dragged through the mud by a Prime Minister for her own benefit that  will not disassociate herself with this behaviour.

It’s disgraceful and I can understand why those 77,000 HSU workers out there today would  be thinking to themselves why am I bothering to pay these union fees when this is going on,  when the leader of the labour movement in the country won't even express outrage about  these - one of her own people being involved in this absolute disgusting behaviour.

KIERAN GILBERT: Richard just a very quick…

RICHARD MARLES: Well can I just say Kieran…

KIERAN GILBERT: A very quick response please.

RICHARD MARLES: In terms of the principle that union funds need to be spent on the  interests of union members, there is no equivocating about that. We've made that completely  clear as have other parts of the union movement, the ACTU, and indeed the Labor Party  organisation itself. There’s no question about that. But to try and leak from there into the  situation of Craig Thomson personally and denying him the presumption of innocence is just  completely wrong. I mean in any other circumstance this would be seen as an outrage.

JAMIE BRIGGS: Well finish the investigation. Why is it taking so long? Why is it taking  three-and-a-half years for…

RICHARD MARLES: Because these are independent bodies…

JAMIE BRIGGS: … a basic investigation…

RICHARD MARLES: … and independent bodies need to be allowed to do their work  independently…

JAMIE BRIGGS: C'mon Richard, c'mon you must be ashamed of this behaviour.

RICHARD MARLES: … and in another circumstance for us to be kind of looking at these  independent bodies in this way would be seen as an outrage.

JAMIE BRIGGS: This tells the Australian…

KIERAN GILBERT: Okay just quickly - one minute left Jamie…

JAMIE BRIGGS: … hang on - what this tells the Australian people is the Labor Party no  longer stands for working people. They stand for themselves and the union bosses.

KIERAN GILBERT: Okay we've got less than a minute left now. Richard quickly on the  asylum seekers. Chinese asylum seekers in the Northern Territory, can the Government really  say that they're going to allow them to head off on that journey? Surely it’s too perilous to let  them do that?

RICHARD MARLES: Obviously advice has been given to them about the perils of that  journey but, frankly, there isn't the ability for the Government to detain these people in  circumstances where asylum’s not being sought. Now, if they do seek asylum, that’s  obviously a different question. But, if they're not seeking asylum in Australia, then the only  thing we can do is warn them of the perils of that journey. At the end of the day we're not  able to just randomly detain people in those circumstances. It’s an odd case but that’s the  reality of it.

KIERAN GILBERT: Okay gentlemen, I'm sorry Jamie we're out of time. We're going to  have to wrap it up there AM Agenda for this morning. Jamie Briggs and Richard Marles,  appreciate your time. That’s all for the program, thank you for your company, we'll see you  next time.
