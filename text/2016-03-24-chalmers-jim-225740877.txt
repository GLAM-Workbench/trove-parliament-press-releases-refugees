E&OE TRANSCRIPTÃ¢ÂÂ¨  TELEVISION INTERVIEW  SKY NEWS, AM AGENDA WITH KIERAN GILBERT  THURSDAY, 24 MARCH 2016

SUBJECT/S: Brussels Attacks; National Security; Budget; Taxation; Morrison not  in Turnbull’s inner circle

GILBERT: This is AM Agenda. With me now, the Shadow Minister for Financial  Services and Superannuation, Jim Chalmers, and Liberal Senator Zed Seselja.  Gentlemen, good morning to you. Jim Chalmers, your thoughts on what the Attorney- General said there about the Government making an understandable decision to  increase security at airports around the country. They were already confident of their  arrangements in place, but in the wake of Brussels, taking it a step further.

CHALMERS: Of course, Kieran. I think that's a very sensible measure for the Attorney-General to be taking. We go out of our way in the Opposition to make sure that we  approach these things in a bipartisan way, and that's how we'll approach this as well.

GI



LBERT: Our hearts go out to the Belgian people. It's a very sad state of affairs, but  unfortunately, and the Prime Minister has made this point, Europe with its lax security in  the last couple of years has sadly opened the way for the bloodshed to happen like this.

SESELJA: Well the first thing I would say is I would send my condolences and my  prayers to the people of Belgium. This is obviously a terrible time, for not just those who

have lost loved ones but all those who have been affected in various ways. But when it  comes to the issues of securing the borders, there's no doubt that Europe faces some  very significant challenges that we fortunately in this country don't face. The Prime  Minister has pointed of course to our geography and that is an advantage when it  comes to these things, but it's not just our geography. It's also about the fact that we  have worked very hard to secure our borders, we haven't had an open flow of asylum  seekers or migrants or anyone else. That's absolutely critically important. You have to  be able to control your borders as a nation and Europe is suffering at the moment in  part because they haven't.

GILBERT: Let's turn our attention to domestic politics now and this Omni-Poll / Sky  News survey, which has found only three per cent of those surveyed -- more than 1,100  peo

ple in this poll -- three per cent support a company tax cut. The Government has got  some work to do,   Zed Seselja, in convincing people this is the right course of action.

SESELJA: Well, let's see what happens. But certainly, I think, that tax cuts are  welcome, whether they be company tax cuts or whether they be income tax cuts,  because I want to see the overall burden of tax lowered. There's no doubt that politically  it can be challenging to sell the corporate tax cut, but at the same time, I think the reality  is -- and modelling does show -- that it has real benefits. Real and significant benefits.  And we can't, sort of, pretend that we don't exist in a globalised market where  companies look for where they are going to be based and they look at what kind of tax  arrangements different countries have. So, you know, cutting company tax is obviously  one option you consider. The benefits of cutting company tax is that you do see greater  productivity, you do see more jobs and, of course, that then benefits Australians and  benefits, you know, the entire economy. So I understand sometimes the politics can be  challenging, but whether it's a company tax cut or an income tax cut, it benefits  Australians.

GILBERT: And Jim Chalmers, there is bipartisan support towards the goal of reducing  company tax over time, isn't there?

CHALMERS: As a medium-term aspiration, that's true Kieran, but I think in the near-term there are two things that make people absolutely livid about the Government's  latest thought bubble about company tax. The first one is that there's very little  confidence in the community that some of the big multinational companies are paying  their fair share of tax as it stands. So people want to see substantial effort on that front.  Labor has had a policy out for some time to get multinationals to pay their fair share --  that's the first point.

But the second point and probably more fundamental is the Government is floating a  company rate cut at the same time as they're taking money out of the pockets of  working class people and people in the middle in Australia. And what they're doing is

they've got all of the nasties from the 2014 Budget still on the table. They've still got  attacks on Medicare, attacks on penalty rates, they're cutting funding to schools and  hospitals, they're cutting family payments and pensions. And you can understand why  the Australian people are very, very dark when they hear that the Government's top  priority -- or its latest top priority -- is to cut the company rate at the same time as they're  doing so much damage to the household budgets of people right around the country.

GILBERT: But doesn't it help the household budgets in the longer term through jobs  and wages growth? Isn't that what the economic modelling shows when it comes to a  company tax cut?

CHALMERS: That's the theory of it, Kieran. But I'm pointing out to you the very  substantial, very real impacts of what the Government has on the table already from the  2014 Budget that has lived on and survived a change in Prime Minister. All of those  attacks on health services and education and payments and pensions which have an  immediate substantial and real impact on people. That's what people are very focused  on right now. The Government is prioritising a company rate cut for the big end of town  over those sorts of things which are making life so difficult for people right around the  country.

GILBERT: This is what's going to make your task all the more difficult. If, as we  suspect, Zed Seselja, the Government goes along the lines of a company tax cut in the  short term and income tax cuts further out into the horizon, this is going to be the  challenge isn't it? With the Labor Party running a campaign like that.

SESELJA: Well, of course, the Labor Party -- and what Jim didn't mention is -- the  Lab  or Party has put out policies and they're all for higher taxes. So the Labor Party is  now saying they're against company tax cuts. They've previously supported that. But  they are in favour of a tax on people's super. There's no doubt about it -- people's nest  eggs. They're in favour of a tax on people's housing and attacking people's housing  wealth.

CHALMERS: Are you ruling out a tax on super in the Budget, Zed?

SESELJA: So there's a number of tax increases that Labor are all about at the moment  and   now they're against a company tax cut -- well, not surprising given that they have

put out a number of policies which are all about increasing the tax burden. Well, we take  a different approach, Kieran. Our view is that we want to see taxes come down --  whether that's company tax, whether that's income taxes or other taxes, I think that's a  good thing.

GILBERT: I just want to finish on a couple of internal Government issues. Quickly, the  Tony Abbott intervention this week with Paul Murray created a lot of focus at the time

and seemed to distract from the Prime Minister's decisive move on parliamentary timing.  Are you worried that this is going to cause a headache for Mr Turnbull in this election  year? That these sorts of interventions will be an unhelpful distraction.

SESELJA: Well, obviously, you know, we're going to see discussions from time to time  and the former Prime Minister will speak. What I do think is during the election and as  we get closer to the election -- it could be on July 2, it might be later, we don't know -- I  think it's absolutely important that our focus is not on ourselves, but our focus is one  hundred per cent on the Australian people, on delivering on our program and, of course,  on pointing out the dangers of a change of Government.

GILBERT: Of course, you were a very strong supporter of Mr Abbott right until the end.  That needs to be said. So are you essentially saying he needs to rein it in a bit as we  get closer to the election?

SESELJA: Well what I would say, Kieran, is I think it would be much better if our focus  is on the Australian people, on our program, and, of course, on the dangers of a change  of Government. Why it's a good thing for the Turnbull Government to be re-elected, to  del

iver on our program for the Australian people and why it would be a disaster if Bill  Shorten were to become Prime Minister. That should be our focus, that will be my focus,  and I think that should be the Government's focus.

GILBERT: Jim Chalmers, I want to ask you about the Treasurer. There's some flak that  he's not in the orbit, the inner circle, of the Prime Minister. You've worked for a  Treasurer before. You know that Treasurers and Prime Ministers can have differences  of opinion on key policies. Isn't that healthy?

CH



ALMERS: Look, Treasurer Morrison is a prime ministerial afterthought. I mean, it's  extraordinary, even by the low standards of this divided and dysfunctional Government,  you've got a Treasurer who's not told when the date of his Budget is being moved,  you've got a Treasurer who gets admonished in front of colleagues at dinner at The  Lodge. It's just the latest instalment in the chaos and confusion that reigns over them  when it comes to economic policy-making. It's little wonder that there's no economic  plan from the Turnbull Government when you consider that key people don't talk to each  other about key issues. Zed referred before, and you referred, to the Tony Abbott  comments -- Tony Abbott just said what everybody knows which is that Malcolm  Turnbull is the leader

in name only. He's still got all of the Abbott policies on the table.  The Party is still run by the knuckle-draggers of the far right. Everybody knows that and  Tony Abbott just said what everybody knows to be true.

GILBERT: We've got to wrap it up, unfortunately we're out of time with a lot of other  news around today. Jim Chalmers, Zed Seselja, thanks so much gentlemen. Talk to you  soon.
