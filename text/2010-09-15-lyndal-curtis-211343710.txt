TRANSCRIPT OF THE HON. TONY ABBOTT MHR   INTERVIEW WITH LYNDAL CURTIS  AM PROGRAMME, ABC RADIO

E&OE……………………….…………………………………………………………………

LYNDAL CURTIS:

Tony Abbott you've given Malcolm Turnbull the task of demolishing the National Broadband Network, how  will you judge if he succeeds?

TONY ABBOTT:

Because people will understand very soon that this is a multi-billion dollar white elephant. It's going to cost  something like $5,000 per household, and that's just to build. It's going to massively increase the price that  people pay for broadband services and it's also unnecessary because competitive markets are far more likely  to produce quality broadband services at a good price than a government monopoly.

LYNDAL CURTIS:

Telstra's been convinced though. How do you explain that, if they're on board, why isn't it a good idea?

TONY ABBOTT:

I'm not sure that Telstra have been convinced. They've been offered $11 billion; so I think they've been  bought not convinced.

LYNDAL CURTIS:

So what will Malcolm Turnbull's task be? To demolish it in the public eyes or is this more about spooking  the Independents who've backed the NBN?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well I think his job is to explain that this is not a sensible policy for Australia and that this is typical of a  Labor Government which is addicted to waste and incompetence. This is typical of a government which  believes that spending money that Australia can't afford, and doesn't always have, is the solution to every  problem.

LYNDAL CURTIS:

And what's your evidence for saying that the Broadband Network will be a problem?

TONY ABBOTT:

Because, if you look around the world, no country has proposed to spend anything like what the minority  Government is proposing to spend on broadband. Yes, we all want decent broadband services at a good  price, but this idea of a nationalised broadband network at an extravagant cost whether people need it, want  it, or can afford it is just nonsense. It is, as I've said before, school halls on steroids and I think it's going to  come to typify this term of Labor Government just as pink batts and school halls typified the last term of  Labor government.

LYNDAL CURTIS:

But if this Government serves out its three years it'll have the legislative base in place to do this, the roll out  has already begun, what can you do apart from trying to convince the Independents to change their mind and  make the Government's term shorter?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well that's certainly something that I will be trying to do. I think that if the Government continues as it's  begun - there were numerous changes to the ministry between the announcement and the swearing in - they  were incompetent and shambolic before the election and it looks like they're going to be incompetent and  shambolic after the election. There's no reason whatsoever why there couldn't be a baton change at some  point early in the Government's term.

LYNDAL CURTIS:

In terms of changing it to the Coalition?

TONY ABBOTT:

That's right. We've got to demonstrate to the Australian public that we would be a better and safer pair of  hands than the Labor Party. That we can be better trusted with public money than the Labor Party and that's  where I think Malcolm has a very, very important role in the new term of Parliament.

LYNDAL CURTIS:

So would your aim be to convince the Independents to switch their support to you or to show that the  Parliament's not working and force another election?

TONY ABBOTT:

I don't think we need another election, what I think we need is a good government and what I think is pretty  obvious is that we're not going to get good government from the Labor Party. As I said they couldn't  announce a ministry and get to the swearing in a few days later without having to make numerous changes  because the Prime Minister obviously hadn't thought it through and it just shows, yet again, that the  amateurs are in charge in Canberra.

LYNDAL CURTIS:

So you're aim will be to convince the Independents?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think that's what we should be doing and, as I said, with someone like Malcolm in charge of  communications policy, in charge of exposing the waste and extravagance inherent in the Government's  broadband plans that becomes a very real prospect.

LYNDAL CURTIS:

Are you concerned at all about elevating a potential rival in a portfolio you say is crucial?

TONY ABBOTT:

I want to see us maximise our talent and if Malcolm can utterly demolish the nationalised broadband  network in the eyes of the public, well no one will be more delighted than I am.

LYNDAL CURTIS:

There were some calls from your MPs, particularly privately, for a wider reshuffle. Why did you not take  that route?

TONY ABBOTT:

Because it's a very good team already, Lyndal. Don't forget we've achieved something historic. This is only  the second time in a hundred years that a first term government has lost its majority at the first election that  it faced and you don't significantly change a team which has done as well as my frontbench as done, but  when you've got someone of Malcolm Turnbull's ability for all sorts of reasons outside the team, you bring  him in, you give him a big job, which is what I've done.

LYNDAL CURTIS:

The Government's putting together its legislative program. You can combine with non-Labor parties to pass  legislation, are you developing your own program?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think that there are quite a few measures that will be going up to the Parliament from us pretty soon. I want  to overturn the Wild Rivers legislation which is a serious attack on the rights of Aboriginal people in Cape  York. I want to see a cost benefit analysis, a full cost benefit analysis of the National Broadband Network so  that we can learn the right lessons about the Government's proposal. I think it's very important that we have  a judicial enquiry into the school halls rip-offs and the pink batts disaster and I'd be very surprised if cross-bench members of Parliament wouldn't support those three pieces of private member’s legislation.

LYNDAL CURTIS:

And finally, on the question of asylum seekers, if the Government comes to Parliament with legislation to  establish a regional processing centre in East Timor will you pass it?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well how can the Australian Parliament legislate for something to happen in East Timor, a sovereign  country?

LYNDAL CURTIS:

But surely if the Australian Government is involved in some way there may be need to appropriate money  for that.

TONY ABBOTT:

And look the thing is that the only country which is prepared to accept a processing centre is Nauru.

LYNDAL CURTIS:

But if the Government can convince East Timor to set up a processing centre there and it requires some sort  of legislation in Australia will you support it?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well I certainly support off-shore processing but I think it should be done in countries that want it, not in  countries that don't want it and I think it should be done at the best possible price to the Australian taxpayer,  and given that we've already spent the money in Nauru let's have the centre there.

LYNDAL CURTIS:

Tony Abbott, thank you very much for your time.

TONY ABBOTT:

Thanks very much.
