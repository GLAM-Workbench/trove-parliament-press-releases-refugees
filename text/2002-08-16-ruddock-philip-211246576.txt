Managed Migration - Who does the managing?

A presentation by The Hon Philip Ruddock, Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, to senior Government officials and academics, Australia House, London UK, 16 August, 2002

(Note: figures mentioned in the speech are available at the bottom of the page.)

People movement issues are increasingly taking on a more global dimension.

Many of the issues that we face in Australia are similar to those that you face in the UK and Europe. I'd like to take this opportunity today to briefly mention how we in Australia understand and address these issues.

I might start by very briefly outlining the key principles on which Australian immigration policy is based and some of the fundamental reasons why we see a managed Migration Program as essential to our current and future wellbeing as a nation.

We are, as you would know, one of only a few countries in the world that has a large scale, managed migration program, which we have operated for over 50 years. In fact, in per capita terms, we still have higher rates of annual net migration than most other countries [see figure 1]. While some of this net migration is generated by New Zealanders, who have an essentially automatic right to live and work in Australia, the rest of this inflow is regulated and managed through a set of temporary and permanent entry programs.

The principles underlying these programs are simple but very important.

Firstly, migrant selection is on a strictly non-discriminatory basis, in terms of race, religion, colour or ethnicity.

Secondly, the overall immigration intake must be demonstrably in the national economic interest. That is, it must contribute to the nation's economic and social wellbeing.

Thirdly, as in nearly all democracies, Australians are entitled to family reunion with close family members such as spouses, fiance(e)s and dependent children.

Fourthly, Australia must contribute its fair share to the resettlement of those in the greatest humanitarian need. This principle is served largely through the offshore Humanitarian Program that devotes very considerable resources to helping identify those most in need of resettlement and supporting them after they arrive in Australia.

Finally, we must have the capacity to manage the movement of people across our borders in an orderly and efficient manner - without this capacity, the concept of a managed immigration policy is pointless.

I should add here, that running an immigration program along these lines might sound straightforward, but the reality is that it takes an enormous amount of planning, administration, expertise and experience to get it right. I would be happy to go further into the details of how we administer the programs at the end of my talk.

I have outlined the values, now what about the benefits? These lie in three areas, economic, demographic and social.

Economic Benefits

In Australia we have very deliberately re-balanced the Migration Program towards the entry of young, educated English-speaking skilled workers and their families. Whereas in 1992-93 the Skill Stream accounted for around 30 per cent of the Program, it now stands at 57 per cent - nearly double.

The program has also grown in recent years - the 2002-03 Migration Program will be the largest and most highly skilled in over a decade.

We have tilted the program towards skilled entry because we have unequivocal evidence that these skilled migrants have the best labour market outcomes - they get better jobs faster, they fill identified gaps in the labour market and they contribute significantly to the Commonwealth budget

[see figure 2]. This slide shows that the cumulative net budgetary benefit of the Migration Program reaches close to $35 billion after ten years.

The results of our greater emphasis on English language ability, skills, qualifications and age are quite graphic [see figure 3]. This slide shows the labour market outcomes after six months in Australia of two cohorts of skilled migrants, one of which came before and the other after we changed the selection criteria. You can see that the unemployment rate of new migrants has more than halved.

It is also probable that a steady influx of highly trained and skilled young migrants has enhanced Australia's rate of productivity growth, which is one of the highest in the OECD.

Incidentally, it does not appear that the success of these skilled migrants is coming at the expense of lower skilled Australians. In fact, the skilled migrants create work for lower skilled Australians and cause a redistribution of income towards these workers. This is in stark contrast with the USA where research by George Borjas shows that competition from large-scale unskilled migration to that country is driving down the wages of unskilled Americans.

Demographic Benefits

Our economic future is also tied to our demographic future. With a fertility rate similar to the UK's (around 1.7) we are looking at negative population growth by around 2030, without a substantial migration program  [see figure 4].

Even with current and projected levels of net migration, our labour force growth will slow very considerably over the next decade or so.

The demographic reality is that our population will age quite sharply over the next fifty years, although not as sharply as in many other developed nations.

Our research indicates, however, that we should be able to weather this one-off transition to an older population if we take some reasonable safeguards. Essentially these are:

to maintain a substantial Migration Program weighted towards skilled young migrants; Ã¢ÂÂÃ¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â» to encourage the labour force participation of older workers; and Ã¢ÂÂÃ¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â» to help Australian women balance work and family life. Ã¢ÂÂÃ¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»

And I should note that these things are worth doing in their own right and not simply for their demographic benefits.

Social Benefits

The modern nation of Australia was built on immigration. It is part of our identity. Migrants provide very tangible links to the rest of the world for a country that is quite geographically remote.

It would be easy for Australia to become isolated socially and culturally from its Asian neighbours and from its European origins if not for a steady stream of migrants from both these regions.

And don't forget, Australia was established as part of the world's first truly global network - the British Empire. We have always been a global nation.

This brings me to my final point.

Some people argue that the free movement of people between countries should go hand in glove with trade liberalisation and the global movement of capital.

I would argue that globalisation certainly means that particular types of movements should be greatly facilitated. For example, Australia is a world leader in providing fast and efficient entry for temporary entrants who wish to come for a variety of purposes, including business. We are also host to millions of tourists every year whose travel we handle efficiently and effectively.

However, I do not agree that because we insist on retaining control over our own borders we are somehow less than a tolerant and open nation.

Let me quote another participant at the Sydney conference, Dr Alexander Cassella, late of the UNHCR, who spoke with the authority of many years experience in the fields of refugee and people movement.

Dr Cassella said: 'Ease of transportation, the global revolution in communications, the enduring economic crisis of the third world, combined with protracted internal conflicts and social upheavals…have led to a globalisation of population displacement. The end result is a combined mass of legal and illegal migrants, asylum seekers and refugees.'

It is up to nations like Australia to deal effectively and fairly with this "combined mass of legal and illegal immigrants".

We do so through the Migration and Humanitarian Programs which provide a set of well managed and orderly avenues for migrating to Australia for those who are close family members, have the skills that we need or who most need our humanitarian help.

The continuing success of these programs depends on the support of the Australian public. This support in turn depends on the fairness, integrity and rigour of our migration programs.

In a world in which the international movement of people is increasing and becoming more complex, the challenges to these orderly programs are mounting.

When the distinction between a well managed and generous immigration program and informal and unregulated movements begins to break down, we are in trouble.

People in my country, and, I suspect in many others, will accept and support substantial migration flows when they can see that they are orderly, fair, well managed and beneficial.

On the other hand, when people see control over immigration undermined and breaking down, there is a public backlash. Intolerance towards migrants increases and support for immigration declines. Ironically, this can occur in the very countries where the need for the economic and demographic benefits of immigration is greatest.

For Australia, immigration is far too important for us to allow this scenario to become reality. That is why the Government is resolved to manage immigration and not be managed by it.
