KIERAN GILBERT: First though this morning on AM Agenda I spoke to the Schools Education Minister, Peter Garrett a bit earlier this morning from Melbourne. I did discuss with him the raging school funding debate but I began by asking him about Mr Broadbent's criticism of his own party's asylum seeker policy.

PETER GARRETT: What Russell Broadbent has done today, Kieran is to basically expose Scott Morrison for his major dog whistle which is really deserving of fair dinkum condemnation and of course Mr Broadbent, as a member of the Liberal Party, sits on the backbench, he's taken an interest in these issues and I think he's made it perfectly clear that the views that have been expressed by Mr Morrison are totally unpalatable and unacceptable.

KIERAN GILBERT: Mr Morrison in making the case yesterday also said that by identifying where asylum seekers re-settled, giving that information to the police and others, that that would help provide support services too?

PETER GARRETT: Well all he's trying to do is cover up what is obviously an extreme view that he's put. It's dog whistling and it goes to the heart of the flaws in the Opposition's policy on this issue because who could forget Mr Abbott saying that he still wants to turn the boats back even though senior members of the Defence Forces and the Navy have pointed out that that's simply not the most appropriate way to deal with this issue.

You can't inflame community sentiment and emotion around this issue in this way if you want to consider yourself to be a responsible politician and Russell Broadbent has on a member of his own party.

KIERAN GILBERT: We've got a couple of issues we need to touch on before we get on to school funding. There's some issues relating to school funding that I want to ask you about this morning but on the coalition and its approach to the Government and its attack ad essentially yesterday released on YouTube, using various comments about Kevin Rudd from a year ago and Julia Gillard complaining of dysfunction, paralysis, sabotage and chaos, that sort of advertisement that will continue won't it while the leadership talk continues within the Labor Party?

PETER GARRETT: Well, again my job is to focus on those things which I have responsibility for Kieran and which I reckon are going to make a very big difference to the wellbeing of this nation, particularly young Australians and these are issues that, you know, you'll want to talk about at great length and they represent what the Opposition is trying to do which is to distract people from the policy substance of this Federal Labor Government. And the fact is that we have got a lot of positive things which we're doing and a lot of positive things that we want to do.

And, that's why I'm here in Melbourne today making an announcement about additional investment in Literacy and Numeracy National Partnerships. That's the main game here, getting on with making sure that every school is a great school and delivering a National Plan for School Improvement, not getting distracted by what the Liberals may or may not run on YouTube.

KIERAN GILBERT: I'll get to the - that funding announcement today and other school funding matters in just a moment but I want to ask you about one other issue that was around yesterday and it was a bit of a gaff from Mark Butler having a dig at Rooty Hill yesterday.

The local member, Ed Husic wasn't too happy about it;it wasn't a great way to start this

effort to engage with Western Sydney, was it?

PETER GARRETT: Look, he's apologised for that and I think to go out to a part of one of our major cities where there's what, two million people or so, an area which is experiencing considerable growth and has got a range of challenges is a positive thing to do at this time of the year and I think it's an area that I know very well, both from my former life and now.

I look at the schools there, Kieran, in Western Sydney where you do have quite a number of kids in these schools who are from lower socio-economic communities who again can only benefit from a National Plan for School Improvement focusing on the needs of all students and all schools.

There are many, many people there in Western Sydney who I think will be interested in the policies of the Government and the fact that the Prime Minister is going to be spending a significant period of time there and not having to do the commute, by the way, which we're all aware of is a good thing.

KIERAN GILBERT: You're in Melbourne today;you do have that literacy and numeracy announcement. It's also the place or the State where you've got the biggest battle at the moment with your National funding model. There were reports this week that suggested that the Victorian schools would get about a quarter - a bit under a quarter of the eventual Gonski funding package leaving that State a billion dollars short compared to the additional $400 million announced every year by Premier Baillieu.

Are those figures right? Was that report correct?

PETER GARRETT: Well I think what that report was pointing out was that whatever the eventual quantum’s on the Gonski recommendations are, and remember the ballpark figure is around $6.5 billion a year, although we've said that we want to transition additional funding, it would in all likelihood be greatly in excess of what the Baillieu Government has put up.

But, there's much more to it than that Kieran and today I'm announcing an additional $41 million in literacy and numeracy support in a new national partnership in Victorian schools at the very time that the Baillieu Government is walking away from all of the work that's been underway over the past year and those recommendations of the Gonski panel, which I think most people now really understand were super important to the prospects of young Australians in our schools.

Remember that one of the bits of - a statistic, if you like - to get us focused this morning is that around a third of all young Australian students going into high school have been determined not to be able to read or write properly.

Now the impact that this will have, not only on them and their lives, but on our economy in the future, cannot be underestimated. We need a National Plan for School Improvement which is targeted and focused on these issues.

That's what we're prepared to deliver and what Premier Baillieu seems to be doing is not only pulling some kind of political stunt but short changing his own students and his own State.

KIERAN GILBERT: When it comes to reaching a deal with Victoria we know with the health funding arrangement that deal basically fell over. The Government had to go around the State to provide the funding to hospitals. Is that something you would look at if the Victoria Government does not play ball at COAG later this year?

PETER GARRETT: It's absolutely essential for us to deliver a National Plan for School Improvement working cooperatively and productively with both each State Government and also with the non-government school sector. The Victoria Government runs the Victorian schools in the Government sector, Kieran even though we provide them with significant support and we've been in discussions with their officials and I've been in discussions with their ministers up to this point in time.

And, the tragedy here is that we are on the cusp of a truly reforming agenda on education, which can transform our schools and make sure we lift the performance of all our kids and now Victoria wants to head off in another direction.

So, no we won't be taking up the option that you've proposed. What we will be doing is seeking to persuade the Victorian Government to reconsider and to think about the interests of the kids in their schools because under a National Plan for School Improvement the whole purpose of it is it's a needs based funding system, delivering more investment, no school will lose a single dollar in funding and particularly in those areas where kids may be struggling, providing them with the extra support and targeted intervention that they need.

KIERAN GILBERT: Finally Minister, Christopher Pyne, the shadow education minister has argued the case for more practical teaching methods based on didactic methods rather than child centred learning. Mr Pyne argued this week that mounting evidence suggests primary school children, with particular disadvantage, would be better off being taught this way but research is being ignored on this alternative way of teaching students that more traditional approach.

What do you make of that case made by Mr Pyne?

PETER GARRETT: Look what we've seen this week from Christopher Pyne on education shows how totally out of touch he is with education in Australia. I can't think he's been to that many schools if he wants us to head back to a period some 40 years ago, the so-called chalk and talk period.

The classrooms of today and the effective teaching strategies of today are not strategies based on values and instructional learning from someone standing up at the front of the classroom, they're based on good teaching in a classroom to the needs of the students and many schools now in the country separate their students as they need.

Sometimes they'll teach them as a full class but this is a ridiculous assertion by Christopher Pyne, as is the only policy announcement that I can see from them around teacher training which is that he'll convene an advisory group to tell him something that frankly we already know and that is that focusing on quality teaching, making sure that every school has a plan in place to apply additional resources and strategies to help kids as they're learning, reading and writing and maths, is the way in which we enable them to get a good education.

We know what works;we know it will take extra resources. This Government is committed to doing that and we want to get on with it and not get distracted by these deficiencies and stupidities from Christopher Pyne.

KIERAN GILBERT: Minister, thanks for your time today, appreciate it.

PETER GARRETT: Thanks, Kieran.
