E&OE

ALAN JONES:

The Leader of the Opposition Tony Abbott is with me in the studio. Tony, good morning.

TONY ABBOTT:

Good morning Alan.

ALAN JONES:

I suppose I have to begin by asking you about this kerfuffle today and an attack by the Deputy Prime Minister

Julia Gillard for what you’ve said in an Australian Women’s Weekly article in which you referred to a woman’s

virginity as a gift. Julia Gillard says this confirms the worst fears of Australian women. Just before Mr Abbott

answers, by way of clarification, I should say that this is a wide-ranging story on Tony Abbott in the Australian

Women’s Weekly which raises a whole series of questions that - as the story acknowledges - most politicians

wouldn’t be asked. In fact, the story says “he then patiently answers a series of difficult questions that almost

every other politician in the country would have tried to avoid”. The story goes on. First question: sex before

marriage. It then provides his answer: “it happens and I think I’d say to my daughters if they were to ask me this

question… It’s the greatest gift that you can give someone, the ultimate gift of giving, and don’t give it someone

lightly, that’s what I would say”. Is that going to get you into trouble?

TONY ABBOTT:

I suppose it already has in a sense, Alan, but I was trying to honestly answer a series of questions. As the parent

of teenage kids, I wrestle with these things. I think all parents do under those circumstances and I was trying to

give an honest response to a journalist who I think was asking honest questions.

ALAN JONES:

You made the point in the article that you weren’t trying to be a preacher. Julia Gillard has said - and it’s obvious

that people are looking to get a bit of skin off you - that it was scary when politicians started making

pronouncements about what women should do with their bodies. Is that a misrepresentation of your position?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well I think it is, Alan, and I think that Julia plainly hasn’t read the piece. Now I guess she’s a politician who’s

trying to score political points, but I was asked what’s the advice I would give to my own kids. Now, obviously, a

parent talking to his or her own children is going to be saying different things than someone talking to the world at

large so to speak, and the last thing I would want to do is to impose my views on the wider world, but in my

position I think I’ve got to be honest and upfront about what my views are.

ALAN JONES:

The academic Catharine Lumby said your comments hark back to an era when women “were shamed and

blamed for having a normal sexual appetite and behaviour”. The sex therapist Bettina Arndt has said “if we were

to grill a range of male politicians about their sexual views and their attitudes towards their daughters’ sexuality

we would find many who are less comfortable and thoughtful than Tony Abbott. I think many people admire his

willingness to speak openly about his personal life, his mistakes and his attempts to reconcile personal moral

beliefs with what he knows to be the reality of women’s lives”. Is this a subject that, apparently, for some reason

is off limits?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well I guess Alan because of my past - I had three years as you know as a trainee priest - I get hit with this kind

of stuff to a greater extent than most people. But the nature of public life today, Alan, is…

ALAN JONES:

…but also in your past you’ve admitted publicly your own personal flaws and you’ve talked about having sex

before marriage and so on. You’ve done that. Everyone knows almost everything there is to know about you.

TONY ABBOTT:

And this is the goldfish bowl of public life. It’s awkward and it’s difficult but I think we have to accept it for what it

is, and that’s what I’ve tried to do.

ALAN JONES:

You’ve also been belted over the head over the issue of abortion. You make it clear in this article you said “I’ve

never suggested that it should be recriminalised. All I’ve ever said was that I’d like to see fewer abortions”. Is

there someone out there who’d like to see more?

TONY ABBOTT:

No. But again you see, Alan, the difficulty is that there are some subjects which are off limits. Now funnily enough

they’re often the most important subjects of all and I think that it is important to try to be honest and upfront about

these things without necessarily trying to be legislative or prescriptive about it and that’s what I was trying to be in

that discussion.

ALAN JONES:

Right. Just away from all of this. Mr Rudd has had quite a bit to say since he’s come back from holidays - major

set piece speeches. Nothing about climate change. Why do you think that is?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think that the Copenhagen conference has really changed public attitudes here. I think what we saw in

Copenhagen was the totally unrealistic nature of Mr Rudd’s desire to save the world on his own. The truth is that

other countries are not going to compromise their economic progress to prevent carbon dioxide emissions and,

let’s face it, why should China and India hold back the advance of their peoples in this cause. I think people are

figuring out that Australia can’t save the world on its own, and a great big tax on everything in the guise of an

environmental policy is not a very smart thing to do.

ALAN JONES:

But Mr Rudd went to the people at the last election with all sorts of promises. He was going to change the world

on carbon emissions and climate challenge was the great moral crisis of the decade - it wasn’t just a here and

now thing. He was going to change the business about grocery prices and fuel tax and it was the Coalition’s

problem about interest rates and now all these other new promises. Is this something that you’ll be addressing

when parliament resumes next week? Do we have a Prime Minister whose word can’t be really taken at face

value?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think people are deciding that the guy is all talk and no action. Now all of the subjects that he raises are

important subjects, but Prime Ministers shouldn’t get into this unless there is something they can do to fix them

unless there’s something they can usefully do about them, and the problem is that Mr Rudd has proven much

better at talking about these issues than at dealing with them and this is a big political difficulty for him. I certainly,

Alan, think that what Prime Ministers need to do is pick a few important subjects and make a difference rather

than trying to be control freaks determining everything that happens in our country, because you just can’t do it.

ALAN JONES:

Professor Garnaut - who wrote the Garnaut climate change review and was regarded as Mr Rudd’s principal

adviser on climate change - says that an imperfect scheme is better than delay and we should have a carbon

tax.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well I think he’s wrong. I think that if we want to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, let’s take direct action to do

that. Let’s not raise the price of everyday life and that’s what a carbon tax or an emissions trading scheme would

do.

ALAN JONES:

Are you going to release a policy on climate change?

TONY ABBOTT:

Yes, before the Parliament goes back at 2 o’clock next Tuesday we’ll have a policy out there, Alan.

ALAN JONES:

You’re under attack already. Apparently the Government has had the bureaucracy working overtime to anticipate

this policy and they’re going to say - according to reports - that 30 million hectares of trees would have to be

planted for you to meet the minimum greenhouse gas reduction of 5% by 2020.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well look I think that’s all just nonsense. I mean what they have done is they’ve taken an exaggerated view of

some suggestions that Malcolm Turnbull made back in February last year. Now Malcolm’s speech back in

February last year was a perfectly good speech. It was in its way a milestone speech. But I think if the

Government is going to run around to try and cost Opposition policies, it would be much better off releasing

detailed costings of its own policies instead.

ALAN JONES:

Lord Monckton told me on Monday that we’ll be spending trillions of dollars if all this stuff goes ahead to reduce

global temperatures by .02 of a degree centigrade. What if any policy in relation to climate change is tackling a

problem that doesn’t exist? The problem may not be there?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well this is a fair argument that Lord Monckton makes. I mean Lord Monckton, he’s I suppose one of our leading

sceptics and a scepticism about scientific hypotheses is fair enough. There are lots of people who disagree with

Lord Monckton and what I’ll be doing next week, Alan, is putting forward a policy to try to reduce carbon dioxide

emissions and help the environment. Now, it makes sense to try to tread lightly on the planet and the policies that

I will be talking about next week will be designed to try to reduce our impact on the planet, which is surely a good

thing.

ALAN JONES:

Mr Rudd has had a lot to say about improving productivity and I’ve had a lot of letters here and calls about

making elderly people feel as though they’re a burden on society. We’re going to have all these elderly people;

we’re going to have to increase productivity to pay for them. How can you increase productivity when you’ve got

a deal between Woolworths and its employees agreed to by both and now being torpedoed by the Federal

Government’s industrial relations bureaucracy.

TONY ABBOTT:

It’s a real problem and the last way to increase productivity is to whack a great big new tax on everything in the

name of saving the planet, and on the other hand to also be blowing up the kind of system that the Howard

Government gave us which gave us higher wages, it gave us tremendous economic growth and it gave us

significant productivity increases. Letting the unions back in to small business is not going to help the productivity

of this country.

ALAN JONES:

You made an Australia Day speech on immigration. You rightly pointed out that except for the half a million or so

who identify as Aboriginal, every other Australian is an immigrant or the descendent of immigrants since 1788.

Now Kevin Rudd’s presided over the greatest flow of immigration in years. How does this sit with a carbon

emissions trading scheme?

TONY ABBOTT:

It’s a very fair point. On the one hand he says that he wants to reduce our emissions by some 50% by 2050 and

on the other hand he wants to add about 50% to our population by 2050. So it’s going to be very, very difficult to

reconcile these two objectives and it’s typical of Kevin Rudd, Alan. He talks about what he wants to do but he

doesn’t tell us about how he’s going to get there and certainly this is one of the great unexplained riddles of the

Prime Minister’s aspirations for our country.

ALAN JONES:

You talked in that speech about an anxiety that the great prize of Australian citizenship is insufficiently, these are

your words, appreciated and given away too lightly. If it’s given away too lightly, shouldn’t the nation have the

right to withdraw citizenship from those to whom it is given?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think once people get Australian citizenship, it would be difficult to take it away from them unless they had

obtained it dishonestly. But it shouldn’t lightly be given to people in the first place, Alan. The Howard Government

made some modest but significant changes, with the Citizenship Test, with lengthening the time that you’ve got to

have permanent residency before you can take citizenship. I think they were reasonable changes and I think they

stressed the Coalition’s desire to ensure that Australian citizenship is properly respected.

ALAN JONES:

But you understand out there people are very concerned about those who come into this country and then

behave in a way inconsistent with Australian values?

TONY ABBOTT:

Absolutely right and I think what we need to constantly emphasise is that when people come to this country they

are joining a team. Now there are many positions on this team but nevertheless it’s a good team and people have

got to appreciate whose side their on.

ALAN JONES:

But you said the rise of - in that speech - the rise of ethnic gangs and the perceptions of ethnic street crime

threaten the community understanding that migration should be overwhelmingly a net benefit to Australia. Do you

understand how deep-seated that perception of ethnic gangs and ethnic street crime is in parts of western

Sydney and parts of Melbourne?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look absolutely, Alan. I think that a lot of people feel under siege in these places. That’s a terrible feeling; we

should never do anything that makes people feel like strangers in their own country. So look I can understand

that, I think that one of the reasons why its so important that we should be running an immigration programme

that’s firmly in Australia’s national interests is to put to rest those sorts of fears.

ALAN JONES:

You also said a government which allows desperate people to think that getting on a boat might be a shortcut to

permanent residency in Australia is not blameless. So that is exactly what the Rudd Government is doing.

TONY ABBOTT:

That’s completely correct and the Rudd Government wanted to trumpet its compassion credentials but as a result

of that and the changes that they’ve made we now have this flood of boat people. Now that is very unfortunate.

ALAN JONES:

Just finally before you go, they’re talking today about interest rates, the likelihood we’ll get an inflation figure

today. Are you of the view that we are going to be in trouble because of the spending that’s been undertaken and

the future debt that this is imposed on all Australians?

TONY ABBOTT:

It’s impossible for the Government to be going out in to the market borrowing at the level that this Government is

without putting upward pressure on interest rates. So it’s all very well saying we’ve kept Australia out of recession

but at what cost, and the cost will be higher taxes and higher interest rates in to the future.

ALAN JONES:

Good to talk to you. We will talk again. Thank you for your time.

TONY ABBOTT:

Thanks Alan.
