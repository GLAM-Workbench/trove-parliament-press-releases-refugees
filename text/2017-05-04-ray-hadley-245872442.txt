RAY HADLEY:

Every Thursday we attempt to speak to the Immigration Minister Peter Dutton. He’s  actually in Sydney in the studio. Immigration Minister Dutton, good morning.

PETER DUTTON:

Good morning Ray.

RAY HADLEY:

Now, last week you were in Washington to meet with US counterpart Secretary for  Homeland Security John Kelly. How did those discussions go?

PETER DUTTON:

They went very well. He’s a great guy. He’s a four star general, obviously retired,  he’d been a marine. He’s been in charge of the Southern Border Command for a  long period of time and was in charge of Guantanamo Bay, I think, at one stage as  well.

So he’s highly respected in the US, he’s a very good friend to Australia. He’s got a  connection through his father who was injured during the Second World War in the  Battle of the Coral Sea and was billeted to an Australian family and so he’s got a  very fond view of Australia.

So we’ve got a very good relationship. And it’s an important one because he has  within his portfolio agencies like the Drug Enforcement Agency, so I met with them  and we’re going to have closer collaboration, particularly on drugs coming out of that

part of the region, that part of the world, destined for Australia. So there’s a lot of  work that we’re doing together. So it was a very good meeting.

RAY HADLEY:

I note that Nick Kaldas has been in town this week - the former Deputy  Commissioner of Police in New South Wales and probably the foremost expert on  terror matters in Australia - warning that we can’t - and I know you appreciate that,  as a Minister of this Government, we can’t sit idle and he’s been in Jordan working  for the Arab Nations, but I think he underlined the fact that maybe from time to time  as a population we think; ‘oh we’re isolated from this, it doesn’t happen that often.  You know, Mr Chang was unfortunately killed by a 15 year-old terrorist and we’ve got  a number of them incarcerated’.

But I think Nick is suggesting that it’s not the ones that we’ve got incarcerated that  we need to worry about, it’s the ones we don’t know about.

PETER DUTTON:

Well he’s right. And he is an expert, no question about that. The difficulty for all of us  is that, you’re right, I mean, it’s like I guess growing up for me in the ‘70s and ‘80s  here and you’d see what was taking place in the Middle East or in Ireland and it was  just too far away.

But the reality is that the Federal Police and ASIO, the agencies here, have thwarted  something like 12 possible terrorist events in recent times and we do have foreign  fighters coming back, we do have young kids being radicalised online and the threat  is significant and will only get worse over the coming years because this ISIS  ideology spreads and they want to do mass harm and we shouldn’t be complacent  about it. I think it’s a gentle reminder for all of us that this could happen at any time.

RAY HADLEY:

Is there a thought that the Federal Government will go down this path that’s often  discussed - you know, the forerunner is Homeland Security in the United States and  you spoke to the Minister for Homeland Security, or Secretary as they call them  there. Is it gathering momentum that we need to have our own federal initiative to  cooperate with the states and maybe liaise and direct the states?

PETER DUTTON:

Well, Ray, from my perspective I’ve got a very good relationship with Secretary Kelly  and with other people in the administration - we met with the Homeland Security  advisor to the President at the White House, so we had some good meetings and  high level meetings.

But again the machinery government stuff is an issue for the Prime Minister. I think  any decision on any of these matters he’ll make on the basis of what’s in our nation’s  best interests. So how can we best deal with the threats that we’ve got and no doubt,  he would weigh all that up in considering …

RAY HADLEY:

……..Well I’m thinking with the view of the Budget next week, maybe there’s an  opportunity to say well we need to actually, on the evidence we have from the states  and the territories and the AFP and Border Control, we need to have a federal  initiative and whether that’s a Commissioner as opposed to - you know, even a  Minister for Homeland Security who then has a staff that - and you’ve been  mentioned in dispatches about being the Minister for Homeland Security. Surely, if  it’s in the back of his mind he would have raised it with you?

PETER DUTTON:

Well, Ray, I don’t think the Budget’s going to focus on that. I think there are other  issues that the Treasurer’s been contemplating and that will form the headline of the  Budget.

So there’ll be initiatives in relation to my portfolio, there’s a lot of work that we’re  doing behind the scenes to keep the public safe, a lot of work that we’re doing at the  airports. There’s a lot of work now in the technology that you can use, the analytics  looking at profiles of people’s backgrounds and criminal histories and all the rest of it,  which is why a partner like the US is so important because we exchange a lot of  information. So there’ll be bits and pieces within the Budget, but I think the Budget  will be headlined by other things.

RAY HADLEY:

Okay, outgoing Human Rights Commission president Gillian Triggs has inexplicably  been awarded a free speech prize from the civil liberties group - and it is the big - I  mean, I hate this Liberty Victoria, it’s the Council for Civil Liberties, that’s what they  are - citing her, quote, ‘fearless work in pursuit of other people’s rights, her courage  and persistence under extraordinary pressure’.

This is the same Gillian Triggs who failed to condemn section 18C of Race  Discrimination action against Queensland Uni students and the late cartoonist Bill  Leak from The Australian who dared to exercise free speech.

To use one of my favourite expressions; it has to be a gee-up, doesn’t it?

PETER DUTTON:

Please, Ray, I just want the day to come when we don’t talk about Gillian Triggs any  more, that she …

RAY HADLEY:

……..well it’s fast approaching, it’s fast approaching. It’s only weeks away.

PETER DUTTON:

…please….

RAY HADLEY:

…..it’s only weeks away….

PETER DUTTON:



I think everyone will be pretty relieved, but this is a reminder of how bad Labor is in  government. I mean, Gillian Triggs was appointed by Julia Gillard - they’re fellow  travellers I guess - but that’s what happens when these sorts of people get  appointed to these positions, to the judiciary and elsewhere. So I’d, you know, the  fact that she accepts the award - it’s no surprise that Civil Liberties Council would  offer it to her - but the fact that she accepts it, shows, I think, that she continues to  be detached from reality. And as you say, not too long to go and I think we’ll be  happy to move on.

RAY HADLEY:

I know that - and I can pre-empt your answer already - because there’s a matter  before courts in New South Wales at the moment, it’s about the Iraqi asylum seeker  allegedly staging an elaborate  fake bus crash with refugee friends he met on  Christmas Island as part of the scam. So you’ve got a whole range, allegedly, of  refugees on a bus in Liverpool pretending to have a crash with a Kluger - which  didn’t really happen - and then chasing $1.2 or $1.7 million.

But the thing that drew my attention to this … so I won’t ask you, what’s going to  happen to this bloke and his co-accused if they’re found guilty - I know the answer to  that if they’re found guilty.

However, it goes on to say: in applying for bail which was rejected by a magistrate  named Imad Abdul-Karim - God bless him for doing it - his lawyer said Ari’s  pregnant wife and seven children were here on Bridging Visas and feared for their  life.

Now, given they’ve been here for a number of years, they’ve got seven kids, I’d  imagine there are a number of Australian born children, a result of this marriage.  Does that mean - and just to clarify it with people, I know I’ve asked you this before  - just because a child is born into Australia of parents on Bridging Visas doesn’t  automatically give them the right to Australian citizenship. Is that correct?

PETER DUTTON:

No it doesn’t. But after a 10 year period there would likely be an entitlement for  Australian citizenship.

RAY HADLEY:

Okay. So, I mean, through the course of this, and you see I get all these emails from  people - and I’m not going to typify them as one of part of the community - but they  are for all intents and purposes, they can’t find any good in the Muslim community no  matter what I say. I say, look, I know plenty of good Muslims, they listen to my  program, I interact with them, they’re productive, hardworking, decent people. But  this gives rise to people - and I’ve already got emails, having mentioned it at the top  of the show.

Here’s a bloke that allegedly came from Iraq with a bullet in his knee. He’s got a wife  having her eighth child. Now, we can make all sorts of assumptions, although it  appears that he’s been productive in other areas apart from gainful employment  according to the allegations.

But it typifies what those from that side of politics, the far right of politics, want  everyone to believe that everyone’s no good that comes from war-torn nations in the  Middle East, they get here, they bludge, they have eight kids, they’re going to  outgrow us in numbers and all that and they’re going to go from two per cent of the  population to 25 per cent of the population because they just keep having more and  more kids than ordinary, average, everyday young couples can afford to have.

PETER DUTTON:

Well, Ray, this is why you’ve got to secure borders. I mean, 50,000 people came on  800 boats as we know and the cost of that since 2007/8 - on the figures that I’ve got  - the cost of that so far, and it’s still running up because there’s still close to 30,000  people here that have to be processed and sent back and they’re in the courts et  cetera and we speak about that on a regular basis …

RAY HADLEY:

Yeah.

PETER DUTTON:

The cost over a 10 year period is about $13.7 billion.

Now, that’s money that could be spent on providing support to people that have  worked hard here all their lives - self-owner retirees, pensioners et cetera - instead  we’re spending billions of dollars, billions and billions of dollars, on these cases and  it’s infuriating.

It just shows the cost, the human cost, the financial cost, when you lose control of  your borders. We bring people in the right way and we’ve been very clear about the  fact that these visa cancellations have ramped up by 1200 per cent because we  don’t want people here of bad character.

People that come here, the great migrant stories, are those people that come here  and work hard. And if people are going to break the law or they’re not going to  adhere to Australian values - as the Prime Minister and I announced a fortnight ago  - you won’t be getting Australian citizenship. And we’ll deport people who aren’t

6

going to abide by the law and are going to harm other Australians or intend to rip us  off - without commenting on this particular case …

RAY HADLEY:

Yes I know.

PETER DUTTON:

… and that’s the reality, you know. There’s a new approach, Ray, and these people  need to understand that if they aren’t refugees, they are not staying here. And we’ve  been very clear that if you came by boat you won’t be permanently settling here.

RAY HADLEY:

What people say is, in relation to this bloke and others, because - and I don’t know  the circumstances of which he came via Christmas Island and his co-accused - but  people say, ‘if we weren’t doing the sort of checks that we now do, how do we know  that these sort of people weren’t doing the same sort of thing in their native Iraq in  another form’?

In other words, you know, we’re getting the bottom of the cockie cage in terms of the  quality of people we get here because we don’t know who they are, we can’t check  on them.

But just further to that - and we’ve spoken about the 30,000 people you’re  processing, 50,000 that arrived - whenever I get figures from Centrelink, and they’re  fairly guarded about them, can we quantify how many of these people that arrived  during that period, that horrible period of Rudd-Gillard-Rudd, how many of these  people are actually on the public teat as opposed to paying tax and working on a  daily basis?

PETER DUTTON:

I haven’t got those figures, but I’ve asked for some of that work to be done. The  headline figure I’ve got, as I say, is $13.7 billion and it continues on to this very day  and will into the future because of these court cases and people fighting deportation  et cetera.

So I’ll see what I can drill down on because it is something that taxpayers deserve to  know about, they deserve to know the cost so far, the cost ongoing.

And it underscores the fact that in stopping boats, I mean, there is a huge financial  dividend for the Australian taxpayer. And we just can’t, people who work hard in this  country, pay taxes, they’re the ones that deserve to be taken care of and put at the  head of the queue, as opposed to these other people that might want to rip the  system off. They’re not welcome.

Now I was alerted by an emailer earlier this week to A Current Affair’s story which I  didn’t see and I’ve since seen on the Apex gang in Melbourne. You and I have  spoken about the Apex gangs uphill and down dale and the fact that we have many  people here that you’d like to get rid of who aren’t 18 and we’ve spoken about that.  But this is what he said: when Mr Dutton’s on, could you ask him what he thought of  the Sudanese refugee Apex gang members in Melbourne who appeared on A  Current Affair on Channel 9. They were obviously unemployed, admitted to being  criminals, who gave every indication they weren’t about to change their habits.

Now it seems to be a problem almost exclusive to Melbourne at the moment and we  hope it doesn’t spill over to be the same sort of problem in other major cities, but  where are we at with these young blokes who brazenly admit on TV that they are  unemployed criminals? And obviously they’re on the public teat as well!

PETER DUTTON:

Well, Ray, for some of those they are Australian citizens already and some of them  may have been born here and therefore are Australian citizens if their parents had  migrated earlier.

RAY HADLEY:

…..Yeah sure.

PETER DUTTON:

But we’ve gone through with the Victorian Police a number of cases, we’ve cancelled  the visas of six suspected Apex gang members, there are another four at the  moment that we’re having a look at and we’re working closely with the Victorian  Police. But there are other issues in Victoria, as we’ve discussed on the program  before …

RAY HADLEY:

………well it’s a soft Labor Government and Daniel Andrews is probably closer to  being the first Green Premier in the Commonwealth than any other premier.

PETER DUTTON:

Well the police are banging their head against a wall down there because the bail  laws are a complete farce and these kids are being arrested, put into a watch house  and walking out before the police finish their paperwork, back out committing crimes.

So that’s not happening in New South Wales or Queensland or elsewhere where if  they’re arrested on serious matters or multiple charges or they’re repeat offenders et  cetera, then bail is being denied. But that’s half of the problem in Victoria. So we’re  doing all that we can within the federal laws to try and tidy it up.

RAY HADLEY:

Gonski Mark II. It appears if I believe, and I do believe what’s on the front of The  Australian today, there are some backbenchers who aren’t too happy with the private  school system - particularly the Catholic school system being alienated. And I would  say this to people, and I often get criticised for addressing this issue - if tomorrow,  the Catholic schools and the Anglican schools and the other private schools say, ‘oh  look it’s too hard, it’s too expensive, we won’t educate the children any more’, they  all then qualify to come back into the state system. All of them. From primary to  secondary, and whether people like it or not, the Commonwealth and the State could  not afford to educate every one of those children. They simply couldn’t do it.

That’s why they subsidise the schools to an extent - the private schools - so that  parents who work hard and, you know, in many cases have second jobs so that they  can educate their children and give them better education then they think than they  can get in the public school system. People have got to realise if those schools are  not there, taking up the slack in terms of the children, you know, through choices of  their parents don’t want to be educated in the public school system; if they all come  back to public schools, the place just falls apart. We can’t educate those children?  We don’t have enough resources.

PETER DUTTON:

Well, Ray, the same argument holds in health as well. I mean, Tanya Plibersek’s got  this view that she can close down private health insurance and everybody will just be  treated in the public system.

The reality is that the public system would fall over, so you encourage people to pay  for part of their health cost, or part of their children’s education cost. It works out to  be cheaper for the taxpayer in the long-run anyway.

Now, there’s angst around ‘ah well, why is that Catholic school or that independent  school got that level of facility’. Well the reality is that those parents are making a  contribution to that school, to the infrastructure, to the built environment there, and it  comes on top of the money that then is still provided from the taxpayer. And I think  the announcement that Simon Birmingham has made sees a dramatic increase in  the funding into the education system across the board. And people will always want  more in a system. I understand that.

RAY HADLEY:

But is the backbench restless because they weren’t, it wasn’t part of the party room  discussions, that the Prime Minister, out of the blue, and it got everyone, you know,  seeing him on stage with David Gonski, Julia Gillard’s champion of education, an old  school mate I believe, I mean, did it catch everyone by surprise that all of a sudden?  What’s next? Do we have Pink Bats mark II? Do we have BER mark II? I mean,  people are scared.

PETER DUTTON:

No, no. I mean, the Government’s been very clear about the fact that we want  literacy and numeracy rates to improve. We want schools to get back to basics.

But as you’ve pointed out on your show before Ray, I mean, we’ve got a country of  debt that we’ve inherited that’s climbing close to $500 billion. So, there’s only so  much that the Government can do and there is a significant ramp-up of the  resources into education, and that’s what we can do and it needs to be spent in a  way that is going to improve the educational outcomes of these young students and I  think that needs to be encouraged.

RAY HADLEY:

Okay. A couple of quick things. Bill Shorten, it’s in The Australian Financial Review  today, to respond to the Government’s 457 visa announcement in a pre-Budget  address at the McKell Institute in Sydney. He says a Labor Government would triple  the fees for skilled migrant visas, establish a new visa for academics, set up a new  training fund and establish a new independent body to test whether jobs can be filled  by Australians instead of overseas residents. Has he stolen a bit of a march on what  will be announced in the Budget?

PETER DUTTON:

No, and what he’s done is actually he’s embarrassed himself because this is what  happened when we made the citizenship announcement. They trotted out their  housing policy the next day because they wanted to try and distract away from it. It’s  a, you know, it’s an old political, you know, play from 101. It’s what they did  yesterday, making this silly announcement.

It wasn’t properly thought through and I think he’s made a few mistakes there, which  when the Budget is announced I think he’s going to be quite embarrassed, but we’ll  leave that to next Tuesday.

He rolled this out yesterday to try and distract from the education announcement.  The additional money we are putting into education. So, I think it was a silly play and  he can play his games.

RAY HADLEY:

It’s a sad day in life when anyone doesn’t learn a valuable lesson. And, you know, I  get taken to task by my listeners and I note yesterday that even though I wasn’t  mentioned in the article by Miranda Devine - you were.

She said: “when certain words are mispronounced, they become unbearable. Case  in point, C-O-W-E-D, which means intimidated. Sounds like cow with a D - cow’d. It’s  become fashionable to pronounce it cowered. As in the past tense of the verb, which  means to crouch down in fear or the noun coward.

Peter Dutton is a particular offender, I’m not going to be ‘cowed’ into a different  position when I know what I’ve said to be the truth. It’s illiterate, it sets a bad  example to confuse cow with cower, especially if you’re a Minister of the Crown.”

10

www.minister.border.gov.au



So, I had to make an admission on radio yesterday that I’ve been guilty in the past of  saying cowered, instead of cowed.

So, can I get a promise from you that in future when you cow, you’re cowed?

PETER DUTTON:

Ray, if this was my only sin I would be happy to stop there …

RAY HADLEY:

Are you prepared to out yourself on other words that you’ve mispronounced?

PETER DUTTON:

I’m- maybe Miranda’s got a long list and if she listens …

RAY HADLEY:

Well, maybe it’ll be a weekly episode. …..Like Blue Hills.

PETER DUTTON:

It might be a column she’s generating. Look, I think …

RAY HADLEY:

….Words that Peter Dutton buggers up by Miranda.

PETER DUTTON:

Miranda is, Miranda is one of the country’s finest journalists. I think she’s got a bit of  a…….…

RAY HADLEY:

…….Good suck up. That will get you off the hook.

PETER DUTTON:

I think she’s got a bit of a gripe. She’s got a bit of a gripe on another issue with me at  the moment and I suspect that might have a bigger influence.

RAY HADLEY:

You’re not saying that Miranda’s got some other agenda in relation to you?

PETER DUTTON:

www.minister.border.gov.au



As I say, I think Miranda, she’s a great journalist and if it’s a weekly column, I’m sure  I’ll give her plenty of material.

RAY HADLEY:

Okay, well, but you didn’t answer. Will you say cowed in future instead cowered?

PETER DUTTON:

Without the R?

RAY HADLEY:

Yeah, so you got to say cow and then a D on the cow. You won’t be cowed.

PETER DUTTON:

Sure. I won’t be cowed.

RAY HADLEY:

But you see, sometimes when you, when it rolls off the tongue you can try and say  cowed, buy you say cowered. It sounds like there is a little e-r in there without  knowing.

PETER DUTTON:

Yeah. And look, I think it’s a good thing that people have got time to trawl through all  of this and pick up my spelling mistakes.

RAY HADLEY:

[Laughs]

PETER DUTTON:

If this is what ticks your box each day then go hard, I guess.

RAY HADLEY:

I’m glad you’re happy that people have got plenty of time. You haven’t, I’ll see you  later.

PETER DUTTON:

Thanks, mate. All the best.

[ends]
