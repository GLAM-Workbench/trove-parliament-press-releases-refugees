SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND BORDER PROTECTION  FEDERAL MEMBER FOR BLAIR

DUTTON POLITICISING IMMIGRATION DEPARTMENT RATHER THAN  COMMITTING TO INVESTIGATION

Refugees, law enforcement authorities in PNG and Australian staff and contractors are  caught in the middle of Peter Dutton's he-said, she-said fight over an incident on Manus  Island with new reports Australian Border Force officers feel increasingly politicised and  without avenues to raise their concerns.

Immigration Minister Peter Dutton has been reckless and irresponsible in preempting  the findings of a PNG investigation and fuelled conflicting reports about how and why  this incident began and the type of force used by authorities on Manus Island.

The Australian and Papua New Guinea Governments must work together to find the  truth and ensure the safety of asylum seekers, refugees and staff living or working in  Australian-funded offshore processing centres.

Labor supports a full investigation into how this incident began, who is responsible and  how authorities responded to an incident that is alleged to have included discharge of  weapons and rocks being thrown.

The culture of secrecy must change and it should begin with the Immigration Minister  releasing any CCTV footage that backs up his claims rather than spouting speculation.
