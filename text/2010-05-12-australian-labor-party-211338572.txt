VESSEL INTERCEPTED BY BORDER PROTECTION COMMAND



(12 May 2010) HMAS Childers operating under the control of Border Protection Command  today successfully intercepted a suspected irregular entry vessel, near Ashmore Islands.

Initial indications suggest 21 passengers and four crew are on board the vessel.

The Australian Government changed the asylum seeker processing system, effective 9 April  2010, and suspended the processing of claims for Sri Lankan and Afghan nationals for at  least three and six months respectively, as situations in both countries are evolving.  If  asylum seekers on this vessel are Sri Lankans or Afghans there is no guarantee their requests  for asylum will be granted.

The group will be transferred to Christmas Island for security, identity and health checks, and  their reasons for travel will be established.

The Australian Government remains committed to protecting the Australian border from  maritime threats, including people smuggling. As a result it has implemented a  comprehensive people smuggling strategy to combat this issue with an expanded presence in  the region by the Australian Federal Police, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the  Department of Immigration and Citizenship and the Australian Customs and Border

Protection Service.

People smugglers seek out and exploit vulnerable persons who, having faced uncertainty,  conflict and violence, pursue stability and safety.

People who are owed Australia’s protection under our international obligations will be  granted that protection. Those who seek to exploit and put lives at risk through people  smuggling will face the full consequence of the law.

Since September 2008, the AFP has charged 149 people with offences under the Migration  Act 1958 (Cth). These offences attract a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment.
