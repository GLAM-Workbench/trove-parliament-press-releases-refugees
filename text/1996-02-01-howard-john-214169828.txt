E&OE.

JOURNALIST:

...(inaudible)...

HOWARD:

Well, 1 have two answers to that. The first answer is that I'm  going flat out to try and win a  majority in both Houses. I f  that doesn’t occur, then I will sit down and talk to those who hold  the balance o f power and I think those who do hold the balance o f power will take account o f  the decision o f the Australian people to support our policy. I also believe that when the hue  and cry settles down and the shouting subsides people will see the overall long term wisdom  o f the plan I ’ve put forward. I don’t regard what either the Democrats, particularly the  Democrats, or the Greens have said as in any way closing the door, and I intend to campaign  between now and the election to get a  majority in both Houses.

JOURNALIST:

The Government also said there could be other problems with the sale o f Telstra apart from  getting it through the Senate.

HOWARD.Â·

No problems at all.

JOURNALIST:

Mr Howard, what about the credit rating o f New Zealand announced overnight?

HOWARD:

Well, I think it reminds us just how poorly we’ve done in comparison, how poorly we’ve  done in comparison to our Taf man neighbour. It doesn’t give me any joys as an Australian to  note that we are lagging behind New Zealand in economic reform. I don’t begrudge it o f the  Kiwis, good luck to them.

JOURNALIST:

Mr Keating says that Asian Leaders wouldn’t work with you if you were Prime Minister.

HOW ARD:

Oh docs he? Does he? Well you know is he going to say that Bill Clinton will put a black  ban on me, or will I not be allowed into certain Asian countries? I mean is he really saying  that? Dear dear me, what next? Perhaps, you know, Fm going to be declared a prohibited  visitor to certain countries. The man, the man is losing his grip.

JOURNALIST:

..(inaudible)... release the detail o f Australia’s review on the credit rating before election  day, do you think that would be desirable?

HOW ARD:

It’s a matter for them

JOURNALIST:

Mr Howard, it must take the shine off the environment policy that even Jim Downey on AM  this morning was seen to be backing away from his support.

HOWARD:

I feel very very confident that that policy has won wide support because it’s a good policy.
