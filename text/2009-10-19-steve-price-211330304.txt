TURNBULL INTERVIEW WITH STEVE PRICE (RADIO 2UE) - COALITION  PLAN TO SAVE JOBS AND REDUCE COSTS, ASYLUM SEEKERS

The Hon Malcolm Turnbull MP

Leader of the Opposition

E&OE

STEVE PRICE:

Mr Turnbull, good morning. [Plays audio from his interview with Malcolm Turnbull two weeks ago].

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Good morning, Steve.

STEVE PRICE:

You’re not laughing, are you?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

I am actually.

STEVE PRICE:

I can hear it. Well it was a colourful description.

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Oh well, there you go, you’ve got to have a bit of colour occasionally.

STEVE PRICE:

Correct. Penny Wong said this morning she begins negotiating today, this afternoon. Who with?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Well she will be…the negotiations will be very largely with Ian Macfarlane. I will participate in some of them.

STEVE PRICE:

So this is a head to head negotiation between the Minister and her Shadow, rather than leader to leader. I mean,

you don’t ever sit down with Kevin Rudd and talk about this? So it’s not a negotiation with you and Kevin Rudd.

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

No, well Kevin Rudd has always declined to participate in any negotiations on this subject. Obviously it’s an area

that I have a background in because my background is Environment Minister in the Howard Government so I’ve

been very involved in the - in fact, from a formal point of view I have responsibility, ultimate responsibility for the

emissions trading policy and the Shadow Minister is the Minister Assisting the Leader on Emissions Trading

Policy. Both Andrew Robb, and since he took leave, Ian Macfarlane, who have worked very, very closely with me,

have been doing a magnificent job. And Ian will have the principal carriage of all of these discussions.

STEVE PRICE:

Given the importance of the way this will change fundamentally the way Australia does business, does it

disappoint you that there’s not more involvement there directly from the Prime Minister?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Well I think it would be a good thing if he were prepared to do that but there have been a number of occasions

where we’ve sought to have discussions with Mr Rudd about this and other issues and he always declines. So I

don’t think there’s any prospect of him becoming directly involved.

STEVE PRICE:

The Minister Penny Wong was out talking about this this morning. Here’s what she’s had to say: “We have said

that we will look to the national interest when considering these amendments. Our expectation is that

amendments would be economically and fiscally responsible and also environmentally credible. Obviously the

first sensible step is to have a good look at how much Mr Turnbull’s proposals will cost.”

STEVE PRICE:

Have you costed them?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Well certainly within the totality of our proposals are all very affordable because the different approach we take to

electricity prices will actually have a much lesser cost to the economy overall. So they are certainly affordable.

But of course the real question is not simply, Steve, the economics if you like or the accounting, the financial

accounting of the scheme itself. The real issue is the impact on the overall economy. The real question is, can we

afford to have a Labor emissions trading scheme which is so poorly designed that it will send thousands and

thousands of Australian jobs offshore, and with those jobs of course will go the emissions, so there is no

environmental benefit to Australia or to the planet but of course a very, very big economic cost to Australia.

So our proposals, which have been the result of a great deal of work, are designed to save thousands of

Australian jobs and, I might add, open up the opportunity through what are called agricultural offsets, through

doing what the Americans are doing and enabling farmers and other land owners to create carbon offsets on their

own properties by more environmentally sustainable methods of using the land. That of course enables us to

offset more emissions.

So in fact what we’ve proposed is both more economically responsible than what we have at present from Labor

and more environmentally effective as well.

STEVE PRICE:

Is it all or nothing?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Well, Steve, I’m not going to…if everyone asked that question, you know, what’s your bottom line, how much are

you prepared to give up - we’re going into good faith negotiations with the Government. We’ll do that. We’ll have

an outcome and then we’ll consider what our reaction to it…

STEVE PRICE:

…but are there some non-negotiables?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Steve, I’m not going to go there. I’ve been asked that question many times. There are a number of very important

issues there but, again, if you flag one non-negotiable issue or one absolutely fundamental bottom line issue then

it’s a slippery slope and before too long you have telegraphed all your negotiating points.

STEVE PRICE:

Well let me get that straight then - you’re not ruling agriculture definitely in or out.

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

I am not going to respond, with great respect to you Mr Price, interrogator general though you are, I’m not going

to respond to any questions about what is a make or break issue in this because that undermines our negotiating

position with the Government and Penny Wong…

STEVE PRICE:

But with even greater respect to you, that confuses me because I had the feeling that out of your discussions in

your party room yesterday you came out with the view that agriculture should be sequestered out of this ETS

scheme.

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Oh no, well that is one of our proposals but what you’re saying, what you’re asking me to do is to say what is a

fundamental, non-negotiable point…

STEVE PRICE:

…and you’re saying agriculture isn’t.

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Steve, look, don’t put words in my mouth. You’re a grown up, so am I, we’ve both been involved in plenty of

negotiations, you don’t telegraph your punches in advance of the discussions.

STEVE PRICE:

I’m not trying to be…I think you get the feeling I’m trying to be smart here. I’m not…

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

I’m not suggesting that at all.

STEVE PRICE:

…but we have a very large, as you know, rural audience who are listening and hanging on every word about this.

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Steve, the Coalition are the only people that are out there fighting for agriculture. It is absolutely vital that farmers

know that they are going to be…that direct emissions from agriculture, which is essentially emissions from

livestock and cropping, are going to be excluded from the scheme full-stop, not excluded for a few years but

excluded forever, and that that should be reflected in the legislation as it is in the United States. And so that is

fundamental. And also…

STEVE PRICE:

…but you’re open to negotiation on that?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

…also, the other question, the other issue which is equally important is farmers should have the opportunity to

create value and create great environmental benefits by having access to agricultural offsets which is what is

being set up in the legislation in the United States. You see at the moment what Kevin Rudd is proposing to do is

have a much tougher deal, much less protection being offered and fewer opportunities being offered to Australian

farmers than are being offered to American farmers.

STEVE PRICE:

Can I just say though, do you seriously believe - and I’ve heard you answer this before - do you seriously

believe that if you went to an election opposing an ETS in total, you’d perform worse than if you support it?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Steve, I am really… at the moment I am just focused on saving thousands of jobs and protecting small business,

ensuring that the electricity prices will be lower, that the transition will be more affordable. What we’re seeking to

do is protect thousands of jobs. I am not… for me this is not an exercise in political tactics. This is about

thousands of Australians’ jobs.

STEVE PRICE:

And if we had no ETS, there’d be no impact on those jobs, would there?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Well if we had no… if we did not put a price on carbon, then you would not have the impact on those industries.

That is true. But then of course you would not have a mechanism to reduce greenhouse gas emissions which is a

common objective.

STEVE PRICE:

But you must be being told as you travel around Australia that increasingly people are saying we don’t want a

new tax of any sort?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Well nobody is in favour of a new tax unless there can be a justification for it and the argument in favour of

putting a price on carbon via an emissions trading scheme, the argument in favour of that is that that is a way to

economically and efficiently reduce greenhouse gas emissions over time and it was certainly our policy when we

were in Government and the issue that we’re debating is the design of the scheme.

STEVE PRICE:

If you get agreement from the Government and you go back to the party room and still have individuals disagree,

what happens then?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Well what we will do, Steve, I am not going to take it more than one step at a time. The party room has

authorised us to negotiate on the basis of the amendments that have been published and you have seen. We will

enter into good faith negotiations with the Government. Those negotiations will have an outcome. We will

consider it in the Shadow Cabinet and we will take a recommendation to the party room. The party room will, as

they always do on legislative matters, always do, make the final decision.

STEVE PRICE:

But you have members of your own party in that party room who say they won’t support any ETS under any

circumstances, don’t you?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Well that is true, yes.

STEVE PRICE:

So how can you have a resolution here?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Well you are a keen student of politics and you will have observed, Steve, that over the years from time to time

individuals do vote contrary to party policy or cross the floor. It has happened when we were in Government; it

has happened when we were in Opposition. We respect the right of individual members and senators to on

occasions - it is a right that should not be exercised too frequently but it is a right that should be exercised

sparingly, I would say, sparingly and on matters of great moment - can vote contrary to the wishes of the majority

and that is something that we accept and understand within our philosophy. We are, after all, a party that is

committed to freedom.

STEVE PRICE:

So you concede that there are a number of people within your own party who you will never win over and you’ve

just got to sideline them and try and play on as best you can?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Steve, you are running a commentary. Now I am not going to comment on your commentary. I think I have

answered the question.

STEVE PRICE:

What’s the timing now? Will this all be resolved before the Copenhagen meeting?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Well that is what the Government wants to do. There is really no basis, no justification for having the final vote on

this before Copenhagen and our very strong counsel to the Government is that we should finalise the design of

the scheme after Copenhagen. Obviously all of these issues that are relevant now would be relevant after

Copenhagen but unless you take the view that Copenhagen’s outcome has absolutely no relevance at all to the

design of an Australian ETS, it makes sense to finalise the design after Copenhagen.

STEVE PRICE:

Well the Government obviously runs the timing. They’re going to push it to have an agreement before then. Is this

going to be part of the negotiation?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Well this is… Steve, the issue of timing is one - we have a different view to the Government. They, for no

convincing or persuasive reasons, want to have the vote, want to force a vote before the end of the year.

Obviously if they are able to do that, we have to vote on it. But in the absence of any agreement with us, it may

well be that in the normal course of events, a thorough and diligent debate and discussion of the amendments in

the Senate will, in the ordinary way, run into the New Year anyway. So it may well be that the final vote won’t be

until after Copenhagen, simply because of the fact that this is a very complex bill and will take a long time

inevitably, and deserves a long time, for all of the amendments - not just ours but the Greens and the

Independents and no doubt the Government will have some amendments - all of that will need to be debated.

STEVE PRICE:

I’m going to take a reaction from the audience, 13 13 32, what you believe; where this will now go. Can I just ask

you before I let you go, the Sri Lankan boat people that are off Merak, what should happen to them or are they

now an Indonesian problem?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Well they are in Indonesia. They are in an Indonesia port and they certainly are the responsibility of the

Indonesian Government, just as if they were in an Australian port, it would be up to us to resolve the issues there.

What we’d certainly encourage those people on the boat to do is to leave the boat peacefully and if they are

seeking refugee status, there’s the UN High Commissioner on Refugees’ services are available in Indonesia and

they can go through the normal assessment process like others do.

STEVE PRICE:

What should the Government be doing to stop these boats coming?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Well unfortunately what the Government has done by dismantling element after element of the Howard

Government’s policy is created the very, very distinct impression that Australia is a soft target and in fact has the

welcome mat out for people smugglers.

Now Kevin Rudd says no, that is not the case, but the evidence is overwhelming - not simply in the fact that we

have gone from having hardly any boats to having a great many and thousands of unlawful arrivals - but we also

have the fact that we know from media interviews and evidence from agencies and so forth that the people

smugglers are using Mr Rudd’s change in our policies as a marketing tool.

They are saying, you know, come on pay up, we can get you to Australia, there’s a new government, they have

got a much more receptive attitude to unlawful arrivals so we’ll take your money. I mean people smuggling is vile

business. It is a vile and disgraceful and despicable and dangerous business but it is a business and they are

using Mr Rudd’s change in policies as a marketing tool - now that is a fact and it is working.

STEVE PRICE:

So would you go back to temporary protection visas and the Pacific solution?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Well the focus has got to be on the Government.

STEVE PRICE:

So should they go back to the way the Howard Government ran it?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

What Mr Rudd should do is firstly admit that he’s got a problem, Steve, that’s the first thing he’s got to do and

he’s got to have an independent inquiry to examine exactly what the impact of his changes have been and look at

what measures can be undertaken.

There are a range of measures, we are all familiar with them, both domestic, international cooperation with

Indonesia is obviously a very high priority - that was key part of our strategy and clearly Mr Rudd recognises that

has to be a key part of his too - but the fact of the matter is he has got to recognise his policy has failed. And I

just take you back to when we were in government….

STEVE PRICE:

…but you are avoiding saying what you would do if you were running things?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

What I’m not doing is pretending that I am in government. I am the Leader of the Opposition and what we are

doing is holding…..

STEVE PRICE:

…what is your policy?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Well our policy was what we had when we were in government and we would…..

STEVE PRICE:

…what is your policy now though?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Steve, our recommendation to the Government is they should have an independent inquiry right now.

STEVE PRICE:

An inquiry is not going to stop boats coming?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Well at least it may identify what the options are for the Government to do something about it. At the moment the

Government does not….you see Kevin Rudd does not come on your program, so he doesn’t answer questions

like this.

STEVE PRICE:

Well he does.

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

And he is not accountable and he refuses to admit that he has got a problem. He refuses to admit that his policy

has failed. And he’s got to face up to that.

STEVE PRICE:

I think you are confusing me with Alan Jones, he does come on the program and I will ask him about it when he

does. But what is the Opposition’s position on temporary protection visas now, would you reintroduce them?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Well look, if we were in government we would look at the whole range of policies but we are not in government

today and the issue is not what our policy might be if we were to win the election in a year’s time, the issue is:

what is Mr Rudd doing about it today? And the answer is, he is doing very little. He is pretending that his changes

in policies have had no impact on the level of arrivals. They have. And just as…the hypocrisy of the Labor Party

is extraordinary.

Back in 2003 when Julia Gillard was Shadow Minister for Immigration she said any boat that arrived was a failure

in government policy. Well what does she say about over 40 boats arriving under her Government? That is a

massive failure in government policy. Remember Kevin Rudd said he could unpick the policy fabric left to him by

the Howard Government, unpick that and it would have no impact on arrivals - and plainly it has had a massive

impact.

So it is up to him to come up with the policy solutions. There was a policy that worked and the issue now is for

the Government to face up to that problem.

STEVE PRICE:

Good luck with your negotiations. I appreciate your time this morning, thanks very much.

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Thank you very much.
