THE HON RICHARD MARLES MP  SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND BORDER  PROTECTION  MEMBER FOR CORIO

MEDIA RELEASE

SCOTT MORRISON MUST RELEASE REPORT WITHOUT DELAY

Shadow Minister for Immigration and Border Protection Richard Marles has called for  Scott Morrison to immediately release his Chief Medical Officer’s report into the  clinical treatment of Mr Hamid Kehazaei.

Twenty-four-year old Mr Kehazaei died from septicaemia in Brisbane’s Mater Hospital  after being transferred from Manus Island this August.

We need to know how someone with a cut to their foot ends up losing their life.

Now that Scott Morrison has confirmed a draft final report into this tragic incident  has been provided to the Queensland Coroner, he must make that report public.

Labor has strong concerns about the lack of transparency surrounding the treatment  of asylum seekers under the Abbott Government.

Every single Australian funded facility must be run in a manner that is safe, humane,  dignified and allows for proper oversight.
