MINISTERIAL PRESS RELEASE

RAAF PR S4429/70 FRIDAY 10TH JULY, 1970

STATEMENT BY SENATOR TOM DRAKE-BROCKMAN, MINISTER FOR AIR

THE RAAF CONTRIBUTION IN VIETNAM AND MALAYSIA

On my return from visiting Vietnam and Malaysia for the first

time, I think it appropriate to point out that the RAAF is about to enter

the 7th year of service in the South Vietnam conflict and it seems to me

that the superb contribution three RAAF squadrons are making in these

operations is sometimes taken far too much for granted by many here at home.

The three squadrons - one each of Iroquois Helicopters, Canberra

bombers and Caribou transports - have just passed the quarter-of-a-million

mark in sorties flown. .

A quarter-of-a-million operational sorties carried out in the

conditions prevailing in the combat areas of Vietnam is a fine effort

for so small a force.

And although hostile machine-gun and rifle fire and exploding

mines and mortar bombs have frequently punctured and damaged the RAAF

aircraft, only eight have been completely destroyed in action, This, in

itself, is a tribute to the professional skill of the men who fly them.

And while praising the aircrews, tribute should also be paid to the ground.

staff who skilfully service and repair the aircraft. The excellence of the

RAAF Vietnam record, and exceptionally low accident rate and high rate of

serviceability of the aircraft reflect the dedication of these men who

work round the clock in their determination to keep the planes ready for

use whenever needed.

I believe that when the history of this conflict is finally

written the performance of the RAAF in Vietnam will be remembered as one of

the finest achievements in Australian aviation history.

Although a number of RAAF aircrew have been wounded - especially

those flying in the Iroquois helicopters - the effect of RAAF operations

on the enemy has been out of all proportion to the price paid by Australia.

RAAF HELICOPTERS

In Vietnam the RAAF helicopters are assigned to No. 9 Squadron.

Because they are in close support of the Australian Task Force troops ,

they are directly involved in the fighting. Part of the squadron has been

converted to the light fire team ("gunship") role which provides the

squadron with the opportunity of giving close fire support and protection

to other helicopters during the deployment and extraction of ground forces

in the field and on resupply missions.

In their important medical evacuation role, the RAAF helicopters

are ready for instant response to calls for the evacuation by air of wounded

from the battle areas. These "dustoff" helicopters, as they are known in

Vietnam* carry in addition to the normal crew, a trained RAAF medical

orderly to tend and comfort the wounded soldier in his swift transfer from

the jungle to hospital. Battle casualties are airlifted by our helicopters

to hospital faster than most Australian road accident victims reach hospital

here. This efficiency is achieved even though wounded have to be transported

from battle areas in the jungle and sometimes in the face of hostile small

arms fire. The speed of medical evacuation by helicopter continues to be a

factor of great significance in saving lives and consequently a powerful

boost to the morale of soldiers in action.

The RAAF helicopters have already completed four years of

operations in South Vietnam and although fired on and damaged many times

only six have been lost.

CANBERRA. BOMBERS

Originally there were some doubts about the usefulness of

Canberras in a Vietnam-type conflict, but these doubts were rapidly d--77a ! "

In fact, Vietnam has given a new lease of life to the Canberras. Although

slower and more vulnerable than more modern jet aircraft, the Canberra can

remain aloft longer and has proved to be a reliable and effective weapon.

The 300-man squadron, operating within South Vietnam, sometimes

in support of Australian ground forces, has blasted Viet Cong and North

Vietnamese army positions in night and day raids with devastating effect.

A single Canberra has claimed as many as 33 Viet Cong killed in one bombing

raid on an enemy position. The squadron tally includes the destruction of

7,000 structures, 10,000 bunkers, 1,100 sampans and 5 6  bridges.

No. 2 Squadron currently enjoys a reputation for bombing accuracy

second-to-none in the United States 7th Air Force which directs its

operations.

CARIBOU TRANSPORTS

The Caribou aircraft of No. 35 Squadron, RAAF, will begin their

7th year of transport operations in Vietnam next month. Under the call sign

"Wallaby" the Caribou perform a multitude of tasks. They carry troops and

they help resettle civilian refugees made homeless by war. Passengers carried

have already passed the half million mark. In addition to passengers they

carry freight, ammunition, mail, livestock and even sand and cement for the

building of defences.

The Caribou, because they have the capability of operating from dirt

strips cut from the jungle, are the lifeblood of the special forces units

of the U.S. Army. No. 35 Squadron has flown in supplies to these forces

which are often stationed in the more remote border areas.

HERCULES TRANSPORTS

In addition to the three squadrons committed to operations within

South Vietnam, the RAAF has also assigned fighter pilots to Forward Air

Control duties with the United States forces. Their task is to fly into

target areas before the strike aircraft,  including "gunship" helicopters

arrive, to mark the target with smoke rockets. Many of the RAAF's FACs

have been decorated for their distinguished service in the Vietnam conflict.

Finally, the RAAF continues to make a major contribution with two

squadrons of Hercules aircraft in meeting the strategic airÂ· transport needs

of the service in Vietnam.

In addition to hauling heavy cargoes to South-east Asia the Hercules,

in the year to 30th June, 1970, repatriated a total of 651 hospital patients

from South Vietnam to Australia. ’

Medical staff skilled in aeromedical evacuation techniques have been

caring for the patients in their flights home since the Hercules took over

the task almost five years ago.

Large RAAF1air conditioned ambulance buses gently transport the

patients by road from hospital in Vietnam to the Hercules aircraft into

which hoses feed cold air so that the sick and wounded will be cool the

moment they are placed on the aircraft litters. In addition to the ease of

loading patients, the Hercules have ample space inside so that the medical

staff may move easily around to tend the patients while the aircraft wings

them home speedily and comfortably.

While making its contribution in Vietnam, the RAAF is learning much

of value for the defence of Australia. Although the RAAF performs its

operational tasks in support of other formations both Australian, American

and Vietnamese, it retains its own distinct identity, proud of a great

tradition build up in 49 years of service to the Australia people.

BUTTERWORTH

The efficiency of the RAAF forces at Butterworth, Malaysia was

amply demonstrated by the recent large scale exercise "Bersatu Padu".

The Mirage aircraft taking part reacted in a minimum time to

simulated attacks and achieved a high kill rate.

After inspecting Tengah air base in Singapore I am satisfied that

there are ample facilities for the RAAF detachment which, as previously

announced will be based there after 1971Â·
