HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE TO BURMA

The Australian Government will provide additional humanitarian assistance for people  in need in Burma, including vital support to improve security and livelihoods for  vulnerable communities in Rakhine state.

This contribution builds on our long-term support to Burma’s economic, political and  social reform process, and our commitment to address security challenges in Burma.

It will also undermine the ability of people smugglers to sell the false hope of unsafe  boat journeys to neighbouring countries.

The $6 million in additional funding will provide emergency food, shelter and  protection, and includes:

Ã¯ÂÂ§ $2 million to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees to provide  shelter for displaced people in Rakhine and Kachin States, with a focus on  protecting women and girls from harm;

Ã¯ÂÂ§ $3 million to the World Food Programme, to provide emergency food assistance  to vulnerable people across Burma; and

Ã¯ÂÂ§ $1 million to the Burma Emergency Response Fund to respond to emerging  humanitarian needs.

This funding brings Australia’s total humanitarian assistance to people in need in  Burma to $18 million since June 2014.
