Topics: Privacy reforms, asylum seekers, David Hicks

KIERAN GILBERT:              Coming up on the program, more on this debate with the  chair of the Press Council. First though, the Home Affairs Minister, Brendan O'Connor. I  spoke to him a little earlier about this and the other issues of the day.

Brendan O'Connor, thanks for your time. We've seen another boat arrival. This is going  to put more pressure on the Christmas Island Detention Centre isn't it? This is a facility  already under strain with more violent protests this week.

BRENDAN O'CONNOR: Actually we have been relieving the pressure on Christmas  Island by having detainees come to other facilities on the mainland as we manage our  way through this complex issue, and of course we'll continue to do so. I'm very happy to  indicate also that the disturbance last night has been quelled and the AFP has done a  professional job in dealing with that matter.

KIERAN GILBERT:              But the centre's obviously under pressure if we're seeing  that sort of protest and then another boat arrival into the mix as well. Did Chris Bowen  declare victory too early when he said that the Malaysia deal was already having an  impact on the flow of boats?

BRENDAN O'CONNOR: Well, firstly, as I say, people that want to protest by, in some  cases, committing criminal offences are not going to be supported or condoned in any  way by this government. We do not in any way support that behaviour and people  should be discouraged from acting in that manner.

It will have potential impacts on their own efforts to stay in this country, and we've  charged people who have committed offences, in earlier disturbances, and we will  charge people again if we find them committing state or Commonwealth offences.

In relation to the Malaysian undertaking, on 7 May, the Prime Ministers of our two  countries struck an arrangement. We are finalising that agreement. Since that  announcement more than two months ago, we've seen a very significant decline in  irregular arrivals to this country, because we know it undermines the model that's being  sold by people smugglers to lure people on unseaworthy vessels on perilous journeys.

KIERAN GILBERT:              It hasn't worked entirely though has it if another - if we've  seen another boat of some 52 people arrive?



BRENDAN O'CONNOR: There are a number of reasons why we've seen a decline. If  you compare the first half of this year, there were 28 vessels compared with last year by  the end of June, there were 73. So you are seeing a nearly 70 per cent decrease in the  arrivals and I believe once this agreement is struck you will see a continued decline  because we will have undermined the model that is being sold to people by people  smugglers in the region, and we need a sustainable solution to this complex issue.

KIERAN GILBERT:              Okay, let's look at a few other issues. There are a number in  your area of responsibility. Today you are the Minister for Privacy as well and the  Government is going to consult over new privacy laws to give people the statutory right  to sue for serious invasions of privacy. Now, can I ask you, what sort of conduct are you  hoping to prevent with any such legislation?

BRENDAN O'CONNOR: As we've announced, we're considering the recommendations  that were made by the Australian Law Reform Commission to strengthen the protections  afforded to ordinary citizens in this country if their privacy has been seriously invaded.  What we're looking to do is to make sure that there are sufficient protections in place so  people are not violated, that people's information is not used improperly. And we believe  in two ideals, freedom of expression and freedom of speech on one hand, and the right  to privacy and the right for a private life on the other.

These are two very important ideals that the Government supports, but we need to make  sure we've got the balance right. And that's why we're considering the Law Reform  Commission's recommendations. I will be releasing an issues paper engaging with  interested parties, talking to the public generally, and then the Government will  determine what it needs to do to do the right thing in this regard.

KIERAN GILBERT:              So what sort of behaviour are you trying to prevent? What  sort of conduct are you hoping that these laws will circumvent?

BRENDAN O'CONNOR: Clearly what we want to do is ensure that individuals or  organisations do not seriously invade the privacy of others. In a country as ours, we  should be wanting a defence against people violating your privacy. There are times  when of course information should be disclosed in the public interest, but people need  remedies if they've been violated, if their privacy has been violated. There are some  remedies here. We need to really consider whether they're sufficient.

Other countries like Canada and the United States, we see statutory rights to privacy,  and we're examining now the Australian Law Reform Commission's recommendations  on these issues to see whether we've afforded Australian citizens appropriate  protections, given we've seen I think in recent times an increased invasion of privacy,  and I think therefore it's a worthy debate and the public would expect us to do no less.

KIERAN GILBERT:              You mention the United States, but they've also got a  constitutional right to free speech. Would the Government be open to a constitutional  right to protect free speech parallel to any new privacy law?

BRENDAN O'CONNOR: Well, there's no constitutional right to privacy and there's no  constitutional right to freedom of speech in this country, but they are two principles that  must be upheld in a democracy, and…



KIERAN GILBERT:              So you would be open to that if there are tougher privacy  laws, yeah?

BRENDAN O'CONNOR: Not so much a constitutional right. That would take a very, very  long time to do. I don't have a problem in principle with those matters. I'm just saying  neither privacy nor freedom of expression are referred to in our constitution in that  manner.

But what I will say is that if we are looking at rights to privacy, of course the freedom of  speech principle must be considered. And for example, if someone was to invade  someone's privacy in the public interest, then that would be a defence against the right  to privacy.

So we do have to look at the two principles together and see whether in fact we've got  the balance right. There will be of course circumstances where it is in the public interest  to disclose personal information. That will be the case in I'm sure many examples. But  there are other occasions where it is not in the public interest to disclose personal  information, sensitive information. It might be titillating for readers or viewers of television  for a day and they'll forget it tomorrow, but it can impact for the rest of their lives people  who's had that information disclosed to the public…

KIERAN GILBERT:              This has been…

BRENDAN O'CONNOR: …for no public good.

KIERAN GILBERT:              It's been prompted by the scandal in the United Kingdom,  and there are already laws preventing that sort of thing in Australia, phone hacking and  so on. So the Opposition believes that this is not needed, that you're pursuing this and  whipping this up as a distraction from your difficulties on the carbon tax.

BRENDAN O'CONNOR: That's not how I saw Malcolm Turnbull respond to this matter.  In fact, he supports the debate about privacy. I agree with you, Kieran, we do have laws,  criminal sanctions, for people who might hack into phones, and that might be sufficient.  But my concern is that we have certain remedies in place for other forms of invasion of  privacy and I think it is timely now to consider these two very important ideals in order to  ensure we've got the balance right.

But, if people are doing the right thing, if they're not grossly invading people's privacy,  particularly when there is no public interest involved in these matters, then there is  nothing to fear. We are going to have a conversation with interested parties and with the  public generally and we are of course looking at Law Reform Commission’s  recommendations that were put to us some time ago; we've brought them forward, as I  say, because of the growing public disquiet about the concerns in this area.

KIERAN GILBERT:              The Prime Minister on a related matter says News Limited  has some hard questions to answer. The Opposition says that is a snide innuendo  because of the strong editorial lines that some News Limited papers have run. Could you  tell us, what are the hard questions that News Limited must answer?

BRENDAN O'CONNOR: I don't have particular questions for News Limited. I think that  News Limited is already acting in response to the UK scandal itself. As I understand it,  Mr Hartigan is already now putting in place a rigorous approach to examine how they  operate. Why would he be involving the Press Council chair? Why would they be  appointing judges to consider how News Limited operates in this country if there were  not questions about ensuring that is the case that they were perfectly fine?

So as I understand it, that is what News Limited is doing, and I think they're doing the  right thing here. But of course, when you have a part of an organisation outside of  Australia acting in an improper way, of course it will lead to some questions about how  things operate here. I have no evidence to suggest things are acting out the same way  they are occurring in the UK, but I understand why Mr Hartigan would want to respond in  the way he has and ensure people that they can have confidence with the way in which  News Limited operates.

KIERAN GILBERT:              So they are being - News Limited - and I should point out at  this point that News Limited owns one third of BSkyB, which owns one third of Sky  News. Also, Mr Hartigan is the chairman of Sky News. But that disclosure having been  said, isn't the company being proactive - a sign that it is confident that it hasn't had  breaches like phone hacking, things like that that we've seen in the UK? And hasn't the  Prime Minister gone a step too far in linking News of the World and the News  International problems with the sister company in Australia?

BRENDAN O'CONNOR: Well it would appear that News Limited is responding to the  concerns, ensuring confidence of its readers and consumers of its news in Australia and  clearly it is concerned that people are drawing that connection.

But, you know, when you have the most senior executive members before a  parliamentary committee in the United Kingdom saying they don’t know so many things,  then I'm not sure people can put their hand on their heart and say they know things don’t  occur here.  And I guess, therefore, there needs to be sufficient rigour undertaken to  establish that is the case, that is, that nothing improper occurs.

That is what Mr Hartigan’s doing and I applaud him for his efforts to date.  I think he is  responding and I think that is the type of thing that the Prime Minister was referring to  when she said that the News Limited is having to consider how it explains itself publicly  and, you know, from what I can see, Mr Hartigan’s starting to do that.

KIERAN GILBERT:              So you’re saying issues further down the chain where more  junior staff might have been involved in things like this, it’s got nothing to do, you’re  arguing here, with the editorial lines that we’ve seen from News?

BRENDAN O'CONNOR: Well I'm saying that upon examination before a parliamentary  committee, Mr Rupert Murdoch and Mr James Murdoch, of course, were in the position  on occasion to say that they were not aware of certain things happening.  My only point  of analogy is, if people in those positions were not aware of those things happening in  the United Kingdom, it’s not, I guess, entirely clear that we could be 100 per cent sure  that what is happening in Australia is known to the most senior executive member of  News Limited in Australia.

And that’s why I imagine…



KIERAN GILBERT:              [Interrupts] So it’s got nothing to do with the editorial lines  that some of the papers have taken?

BRENDAN O'CONNOR: No, in fact, as I’ve said, if you do the right thing there’s nothing  to worry about.  There’s nothing specific to News Limited that the Government is  considering.

These privacy laws have been recommended by the Law Reform Commission some  years ago.  If there were any changes at all they won’t just apply to media organisations,  or, firstly, they won’t just apply to News Limited, they’ll apply to all the media  organisations, but it would also apply to individuals.  This is about whether in fact…

KIERAN GILBERT:              [Interrupts] No, but I was actually referring to the questions  that the Prime Minister raised yesterday that those questions don’t go to editorial lines.   As the Government has been critical in recent weeks of some of your colleagues, been  critical of some of the News Limited newspapers.

BRENDAN O'CONNOR: Well I didn’t see the full interview by the Prime Minister, but, as  I understand it, she was responding to the concerns about what occurred overseas with  News Limited and I guess ensuring that News Limited is in a position to say here that  things are done properly.  And I think that is what the Prime Minister was alluding to.

I also assume that is what Mr Hartigan was alluding to when he started to put in place  some reviews in order to ensure confidence of the readers of News Limited and the  consumers of News Limited that things are done properly here.

KIERAN GILBERT:              Okay, Mr O’Connor, two other issues I want to ask you  before you go.  The photograph of the Opera House is featured in an online Al Qaeda  magazine on terrorism and bomb making.  How concerned are you and is the  Government by that?

BRENDAN O'CONNOR: Well combating terrorism is the number one priority for the  Federal Government.  We take any potential threat to our citizens or this nation very  seriously, whether it’s on home soil or not we are vigilant and, of course, we have to  always be alert to potential risks.

I guess insofar as the image of such an iconic building as the Opera House on such a  publication would suggest, I think this is about causing alarm in the community and I  would say to people that that is obviously the modus operandi of terrorist organisations,  to cause alarm and fear.  I’ve not been…

KIERAN GILBERT:              [Interrupts] So it’s more a PR exercise than a significant  threat?

BRENDAN O'CONNOR: I'm not advised at all that there is any genuine threat, but I'm  suggesting that, of course, one of the ways to cause problems and for terrorists to do  their work is to create alarm and I am suggesting, at the very least, of course this photo  is seeking to do that.

I’d ask people to be, of course, alert to the potential risks.  I can assure them - I can  assure people watching now that Government takes this as the number one priority of  the Government to secure the citizens and this nation from such threats.  And, of course,  terrorists will continue to try and cause panic or alarm and we should not fall for that.

KIERAN GILBERT:              Okay, one last issue, the Commonwealth DPP is going to  seek to recover the funds that David Hicks has acquired through his memoir.  Is there a  prospect that this process will simply give Mr Hicks the platform with which to question  the validity of the whole military commission process and, indeed, his guilty plea?

BRENDAN O'CONNOR: I’m not advised that’s the case.  The Commonwealth Director of  Public Prosecutions has seen fit, pursuant to the appropriate laws, to serve this upon Mr  Hicks and I have no reason to question the judgment of that independent statutory body.  It is entirely up to them as to what they do in this regard.  They are independent and it is  not for politicians or ministers to get directly involved in these proceedings and I'm, as I  say, confident with the efforts of the CDPP to do the right thing here.

KIERAN GILBERT:              But surely he would then have the opportunity to put his  case that the whole process was flawed and undermine the conviction in the first place?

BRENDAN O'CONNOR: I’ve not been advised about whether, in fact, that affords him an  opportunity to in any way challenge the conviction.

What I'm saying to you, Kieran, is that the Commonwealth Director of Public  Prosecutions makes these decisions having regard to the law and we, as ministers, must  allow that to proceed.  We should not intervene and whether a person has been charged  or whether, in this case, been served with this order.

KIERAN GILBERT:              Brendan O’Connor, appreciate your time today. Thanks very  much.

BRENDAN O'CONNOR: Thanks, Kieran.
