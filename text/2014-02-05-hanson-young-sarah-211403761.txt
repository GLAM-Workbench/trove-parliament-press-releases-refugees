Julie Bishop must visit Manus Island camp of  cruelty

The Australian Greens have called on the Foreign Minister Julie Bishop to inspect the Manus Island  detention centre while she is in Papua New Guinea.

“Billions of dollars are being spent on these camps of cruelty and Julie Bishop won’t even take the  time to inspect them,” the Greens’ immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.

“When Julie Bishop went to Nauru, she commented on the conditions without even bothering to see  them for herself. I am calling on the Minister to go to Manus Island, inspect the detention centre and  speak with the refugees.

“I plan to travel to PNG in the coming months and will visit the Manus Island detention centre and  the refugees who are being held there.

“It’s essential that Australians understand what their money is actually being spent on, even if the  government is trying to keep it secret.

“The UN has criticised the Australian Government for the disgraceful human rights abuses that are  taking place on Manus Island, but Julie Bishop won’t even go there.

“It’s regrettable that the ‘out of sight, out of mind’ mentality of the Abbott Government reaches all  the way to the Foreign Minister.”
