DECEMBER 1982

SOCIAL SECURITY AMENDMENT BILL

'  If you look at the October 1982 'Social Security Bulletin1   you will find highlighted three injustices in the social  security system.

If you look at the Social Security Amendment Act 1982  which passed through Parliament on 15 December 1982, you will  find that Senator Chaney (after reading the 1  Social Security  Bulletin1)  remedied two of them - the failure to pay family

allowances for unemployed school leavers, and the anomalies  in sickness benefit administration.  The third - the refusal  of the Department to pay unemployment benefits to people  whose factories closed down in the summer - was fixed by  new departmental instructions.

It is not often that such a modest publication can record  three quick5 1  triumphs. We are happy to share the pleasure  with welfare groups who backed these campaigns and with  Senator Chaney who responded with speed and grace.

The Act now:

. extends family allowance payment over the summer vacation until the unemployed school leaver is entitled  to unemployment benefit;

. increases the income limits for students living away  from home from $2,500 to $3,600, and for students living  at home from $1,800 to $2,500;

.  extends qualification for sickness benefit without a  waiting period to the following people Social Security  had declared ineligible;

(a) unemployed persons eligible for, though not receiving,   unemployment benefit;

(b) unemployed persons whose benefit has been postponed  because of alleged work test failure or voluntary  unemployment;

(c) unemployed school leavers who become sick in the six weeks period between leaving school and receiving  unemployment benefit if they cannot find work;

~  (d) pensioners, including invalid pensioners, widow Ã¢ÂÂ   pensioners, supporting parents and recipients of sheltered employment allowance whose pensions have  .  .  been.:stopped;

. gives supplementary (rent) allowance to sickness beneficiaries  transferring from a pension and receiving supplementary  assistance without their having to serve a six-weeks  waiting period;

. gives supplementary allowance after six weeks to persons  ' transferring from unemployment to sickness benefits.

The Labor Party welcomed the legislation wholeheartedly  but moved an amendment to extend sickness benefits also  to sicx persons involved in an industrial dispute,  either  directly or stood down and belonging to a union on strike.

The Opposition did not press the amendment to a vote as  that would have delayed the passage of the Bill which was  correcting anomalies and redressing hardship. We will  return to that cause at a later time.

Senator Chaney's prompt action should encourage others in  despair at the apparent rigidities of the social security  system to fight for compassion and common sense.

UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFIT DURING SEASONAL SHUT-DOWN

The third victory concerned unemployed persons put off for  four or five weeks in industries subject to seasonal shut-down,   when those persons had no recreation leave entitlements.

Until the end of 1977 they were paid unemployment benefit  until their factories, as in :the vehicle industries, resumed work.   Senator Guilfoyle took exception to this perceived generosity  and stopped the payments.

Senator Guilfoyle maintained (23.2.1978 and 16.11.1978) that  they were not unemployed because it was the holiday period.

Though it took five years for the Government to reverse that  decision we are grateful for Senator Chaney's announcement that:

".. if a person did not have a recreation leave which  covered him for the period of closure or shut-down, that  person could be eligible for unemployment benefit for the .   balance of time of the closure, provided that the person  met the .eligibility criteria - that is, he would have to

be taking reasonable steps to obtain work and would be  subject to the normal waiting period. I have asked my  Department to ensure that this procedure is administered  uniformly, and an instruction will be sent to all officers  of the Department to clarify the situation." (8.12.1982)

ABORIGINES ON UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFIT - LACK OF SPEED AND INTEREST

The Quarterly Survey of Unemployment Beneficiaries released  by the Department of Social Security used to give the numbers  of unemployed Aborigines under a classification of 'Australian-  born indigenous persons'.

Since May 1977 the Department has stopped collecting statistics  on Aboriginal social security beneficiaries, claiming these  were subject to considerable error.

3.

I tried several times to find out whether a better system could  be found to establish the unemployment benefit take-up in  Aboriginal communities and the larger cities. Many social  security officers have expressed to me their doubts that  Aborigines are receiving proper entitlements, and this

concern should have been felt by senior officers and Ministers  of Social Security and Aboriginal Affairs as well as Aborignal  groups. . Â· Ã¢ÂÂ  " Ã¢ÂÂ

In answer to my most recent question Senator Chaney has revealed:

. 1977 - the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs suggested Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders be separately  identified in Social Security statistics.

. 1978 - the National Aboriginal Conference (NAC) passed  a resolution supporting separate identification.

. 1979 )

. 1980.) Nothing happended  - 1981 ) *

. 1982 the ..Department is to 1  test the use of forms which  will allow for voluntary self-identification'.

No surveys have been made or are intended to determine the  proportion of eligible Aborigines who receive unemployment  benefit in the interim. (1.12.1982)

Will the last five years of inertia and apathy be followed  by another five or might Senator Chaney speed up the testing  and evaluation of^voluntary self-identification to assess

whether Aborigines a r e .receiving payments in proportion to  their numbers and situation?

WIDOW'S PENSION REFUSED AFTER MARRIAGE ANNULMENT

An unusal case determined by the Administrative Appeals  Tribunal on 18.11.1982 demonstrates the need for further  amendment to the Social Security Act.

Mrs B. married in 1949 and had two children. The marriage  was annulled in 1975 after there had been a separation in the  previous year. The grounds were bigamy by Mr B. who had  separated from but not divorced his first wife.

Mrs B's application in July 1980 for widow's pension was  rejected by the Department; then recommended by the Social  Security Appeals Tribunal; then vetoed by the Department;  and finally dismissed by the A.A.T.

She was found ineligible because (a) Mr B. was not dead;  and  (b) there was no relevant valid marriage and therefore no  'husband'.

Firstly, the legislation should be amended to include in the  definition of 'widow' a woman whose marriage was annulled in  that way.

Ã¢ÂÂ Secondly, it is an indictment of the decision-making process  that Mrs B. has been put through this strain for two and a  quarter years by the Social Security Department and appeals system

YESTERDAY'S NIGHTWATCHMEN

A number of men appealing to the Adminstrative Appeals  Tribunal against the rejection of invalid pension find  their cases determined by Tribunal members whose knowledge

of the labour market is out of date.

On.several occasions the Tribunal has declared that men  suffering disabling physical conditions - chronic back, neck  or leg.Â· strain, often compounded by severe depression -  are fit for work such as nightwatchman or lift driver.

In these typical cases medical experts have given evidence  that the applicant is unfit to rejoin the workforce,  and  employment experts have given evidence that in competition  for jobs, applicants with a history of work injury and  constant pain would stand no chance.

It is unfortunate that some Tribunal members judge that such  disabled people could confortably perform what they call  1  light work1  nightwatchman, lift-driver or petrol-pump  attendant - which are all disappearing jobs.

Big.companies and small factories no longer hire the disabled  nightwatchman. They contract with security companies to  provide strong young men or electronic alarms. In the.few

buildings with lift-drivers, preference is given to disabled  employees within the company or healthy young men or women.  Men with an incapacity preventing sitting or standing for  long periods would not even be considered. Petrol pump

attendants' are knocked over in the forward march of selfÂ­ service pumps.

It is not that these jobs are vanishing at the time of  economic depression. -  They are jobs which will not be  there even if employment conditions improve.

An applicant's eligibility for invalid pension should not  rest on the possibility that he could handle jobs which  are disappearing in the modern world, never to return.

'WHEREABOUTS UNKNOWN'

Double orphan's pension of $55.70 a month is paid on  behalf of 5,000 children. (It did not go up in the 1982  Budget,:when Handicapped Children's Allowance was increased,

probably because the guardians of orphans are not organised  and have no lobby group to put their case.)

Rejection of claims for orphans' pension in two similar  cases which have come to my notice raise the question  that the definition may be too rigidly administered within  the Department of Social Security.

ÃÂ¿ 5.

c -

The Act states that double orphans' pension is payable  where one of the parents is dead and the other is in  prison for a term of not less than 10 years,  in a mental

hospital for an indefinite period or -s .105 A (2) (a )  "the whereabouts of the other parent is  .  not known to the claimant". .

Two. Aboriginal grandmothers (Mrs E .  and Mrs K.) living in  different parts of Western Australia, tookover the  guardianship of their grandchildren when sons were killed  in road accidents.

One tragedy occurred on New Year's Day 1980 and Mrs E. has  taken care of her son's four children since then.  The  children's mother has not been near her children since that  time and her whereabouts have been and are unknown to

Mr and Mrs E .  who are poor people living in the country on  Mr E's invalid pension.

Mrs E.'s claim was rejected by Senator Chaney on 3.8.1982  on the grounds that her ignorance of her daughter-in-law's  whereabouts' was due to a '  lack of effort'  .

Mrs T.'s orphans' pension claim was rejected by the  Administrative Appeals Tribunal which suggested that  Mrs T. could perhaps have located the children's mother  through her family by making a telephone call or consulting

an electoral roll. (It is unlikely that one person in a  thousand would know where to find or how to use an electoral  roll. In any case it is unlikely that people who have  abandoned their children would see voter registration as a  high priority.) .

Does the Department expect grandmothers of little education  and no money to hire private detectives to bring back  mothers who have walked away from their responsibility  as parents? Should the welfare of the children be considered

before dragging back reluctant mothers? Should the onus be  entirely on the guardians?

Both grandmothers are being excluded from a payment of  $55.70 a month for each child,  incidentally saving State  institutions thousands of dollars,  on a definition of  1  whereabouts not known to the claimant', though they are  ensuring that those children who have for years been part  of their households are receiving desirable family care.

The attitude of the Department of Social Security is  ÃÂÃÂ·sympathetic and creating severe hardship. It is possible  that this is the case in other claims not brought to my  attention.

The legislation should be administered in a more flexible  way and if necessary amended so that caring grandparents  can receive recognition for the sacrifices they make to

keep families together.
