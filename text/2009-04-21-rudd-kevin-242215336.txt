Media Release

Extradition of Hadi Ahmadi

21 April 2009

The Australian Government welcomes the action by President Yudhoyono yesterday formally approving the extradition of  an alleged people smuggler to Australia for prosecution.

The  action  by  the  Indonesian  President  opens  the  way  for  Hadi  Ahmadi  to  face prosecution  in  Australia  for  a  range  of  serious people smuggling offences relating to his alleged involvement in four boat arrivals in 2001 carrying more than 900  unlawful non-citizens.

Ahmadi is wanted by the Commonwealth for prosecution for 21 offences contrary to the Migration Act. It is alleged that  Ahmadi was responsible for the accommodation and living arrangements in Indonesia of a number of passengers waiting  to board the vessels.

This is a very welcome development in the fight against people smuggling.

This  action  further  demonstrates  the  close  cooperation  between  Australia  and Indonesia  in  the  fight  against  people   smuggling and proves that those allegedly involved in this serious crime cannot escape justice.

The final decision by the President follows high level discussions between the Prime Minister and President Yudhoyono  last year.

We understand that the signing of the papers yesterday is the formal approval required from the Government of Indonesia  before  extradition  can  take  place.  Administrative  arrangements  will  now  be  made  to  hand  over  Ahmadi  to  Australian authorities.

Australia is very grateful to Indonesia for its assistance with this matter and thanks President Yudhoyono for approving the  extradition.
