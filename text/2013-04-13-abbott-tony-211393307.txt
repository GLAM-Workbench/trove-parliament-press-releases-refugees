TONY ABBOTT:

It’s terrific to be out here at Kings Langley with Jaymes Diaz our candidate for the seat of Greenway. It is  lovely that Margie and I have had the chance to do some of our weekend shopping here at the lovely Kings  Langley shops. I think the people of Kings Langley, the people of western Sydney, the people of Australia  they are looking for new hope, they are looking for real solutions and that is precisely what the Coalition is  offering. We are offering them real solutions as opposed to the kind of divided and dysfunctional  government that we’ve got now. Our real solutions for Western Sydney starts with building WestConnex and  I am delighted that the New South Wales Government is more committed than ever to the WestConnex  project. WestConnex will be up and underway within twelve months of a Coalition government taking office  in Canberra. Our plan for Western Sydney continues with abolishing the carbon tax, the carbon tax is  hurting every Australian family’s cost of living. It is making every Australian worker’s job less secure. Our  plan for Western Sydney continues with trying to ensure we have safer streets. That’s why $50 million from  the proceeds of crime will be invested into making our streets safer. So, we do have real solutions for the  people of Australia. We do offer the people of Australia the hope, reward and opportunity that Australians  are entitled to expect. We offer them a strong and prosperous economy for a safe and secure Australia. I am  very proud to be out here with Jaymes Diaz. Jaymes is very much a contemporary Australian. The Liberal  Party in Western Sydney is very much a reflection of the diversity of modern Australia and I look forward to  having him as a colleague in Canberra as part of a strong, stable and united government. I am going to ask  him to say a few words about the seat he hopes to represent.

JAYMES DIAZ:

Thank you Tony, I would like to thank Tony and Margie for coming back out here to Greenway, it’s  wonderful to have them here again. For too long Labor have taken the people of Western Sydney for granted  and it is just not good enough. It is great having Tony and Margie out here talking to real people and letting  them know that we, the Collation, have a plan and we are ready to govern.

TONY ABBOTT:

Alright. Are there any questions?



QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, do you think Woodside had abandoned its Browse project because of the carbon tax?

TONY ABBOTT:

Woodside has made the decision that it has because of the high cost of doing business in Australia and when  you look at the mining tax, the carbon tax, the red tape and green tape burden, the skyrocketing costs of  construction associated with increased union militancy, I fear that Woodside deferring this $45 billion  investment project is not the last bit of bad news that we’ll get. There has been, I think $100 billion worth of  major investment cancelled or deferred this year and that is very, very regrettable because what we want is  more investment and more employment in this country.

QUESTION:

The Gillard government has just announced $2 billion worth of cuts from university education to fund the  Gonski reforms. What are your comments?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, this is on top of the $3.9 billion worth of cuts to education that the Government announced in  MYEFO, the mid-year economic and fiscal outlook statement towards the end of last year. Look, the only  way to get the investment we need in education and disability services and all the other services that the  Australian people have a right to expect is to build a stronger economy. You never build a stronger economy  by taxing it and regulating it in the way this Government has. So, I say to people if they want better  education, if they want better disability services they should trust [inaudible] to deliver those services and  [inaudible] that is sending the government [inaudible] that is most likely to give them a stronger economy  and that is the Coalition.

QUESTION:

Do you think it is a legitimate move though, to move funding from the university sector to another part of  the education system?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I simply point out that this is just the latest in a series of cuts that we have had from this Government.  The only way to ensure that we really are going to have sustainable improvements in school funding,  sustainable improvements in disability funding is to build a stronger economy and that is the last thing that  you are going to get from a government that thinks that taxing and regulating is the way forward.

QUESTION:

Simon Crean has come out with comments describing the PM as having a tin ear while also saying Kevin  Rudd is not the only reason for the Government’s destabilisation, do you agree with him on this?

TONY ABBOTT:

I am going to let the public form their own conclusions about what Labor people are saying about each  other. I think what the public want is a stable and strong government and that’s what I aim to provide and I  think at the moment there is obviously a clear contrast between a stable, strong and united Coalition and  what we are getting from the Gillard Government in Canberra.

QUESTION:



What are your thoughts on Simon Crean’s continued disruption?

TONY ABBOTT:

Again, I am just not going to get into running a commentary on what Labor people are saying about each  other, except to say that a split party can’t govern a country. As a good Labor Prime Minister said some  years ago, “if you can’t govern yourselves, you can’t govern a country” and that is the difficulty that the  Labor Party has right now.

QUESTION:

The National Party is also going to their pre-selection vote today with Barnaby Joyce. Any idea who is  going to come out on top or are you tipping a favourite?

TONY ABBOTT:

Barnaby is a frontbench colleague, he is a good friend and I certainly look forward to him being a very  strong member of Warren Truss’ team and of my team in the months and years ahead.

QUESTION:

Kevin Rudd is embarking on a national tour of marginal seats. What do you think that indicates?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think it is good that Mr Rudd hasn’t entirely lost his enthusiasm for politics but as I said, if he’s good  enough to campaign he should be good enough for the Cabinet. The difficulty that the Labor Party has at the  moment is that so much of their best talent is on the backbench. What the Australian people want is a strong  and stable government, a government with a plan, a government with real solutions and unfortunately that is  not what they are getting from the Labor Party right now.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, another asylum seeker boat found its way to Australia on Friday, what is a more effective way  and what is your plan for dealing with this asylum seeker issue?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, we have got to put in place policies that have been proven to work. We know what will work in the  future because we know what did work in the past. We need to have rigorous offshore processing in places  like Nauru and Manus. We need Temporary Protection Visas to deny the people smugglers a product to sell.  We need to always maintain the option of turning boats around where it is safe to do so and we have to have  much better relations with Indonesia because most of the illegal boat arrivals transit through Indonesia and  regrettably the current Government has trashed our relationship with Indonesia with things like the live  cattle export ban and panic at a television programme. Now, the awful truth is that as long as the boats keep  coming, drownings will happen. The only way to save life at sea is to stop the people smuggling traffic and  unfortunately the Government has effectively surrendered. They have no solutions. They have lost the will  to try to tackle this problem. They keep talking about Malaysia, but the Malaysia people swap will deal with  less than a week of illegal arrivals at the current rate.

Thank you.
