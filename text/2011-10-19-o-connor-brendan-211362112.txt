E&OE PROOF ONLY

Doorstop, 4 Treasury Place, Melbourne  Wednesday, 19 October 2011  Topics: Opposition threat to aviation security; migration amendments



BRENDAN O'CONNOR:           Well yesterday the Opposition revealed why they  shouldn't be in government, why they're not fit for the government. We had the  shadow Attorney-General relying upon a stolen document to cross-examine the AFP  Commissioner Tony Negus to discuss with him the Air Security Officers program.

Now, as the Government made it clear, we are always looking to find savings but,  with respect to the ASO program, there will continue to be Air Security Officers on  domestic and international flights. It is a very terrible thing that's been done by the  Opposition to score political points by endangering the lives of Australian Federal  Police officers and the travelling public.

The AFP Commissioner Tony Negus will be investigating the document that has been  leaked from the AFP but this in no way exonerates the behaviour of the shadow  Attorney-General George Brandis and Tony Abbott for playing politics with national  security.

What we've seen in recent times is Tony Abbott willing to trash offshore processing  for his personal political reasons and indeed trash national security yesterday by  relying upon a stolen document, as I say, that may endanger the lives of AFP officers  and the travelling public. I'm willing to take any questions on that.

JOURNALIST:   Is the Government just trying to hide its embarrassment that this  document got out?

BRENDAN O'CONNOR:           We made it clear that we'll always seek to find savings  because we want to bring the Budget back to surplus as we've committed to do, and  indeed those savings were within the Budget papers of this year. It's also very  important to note in relation to aviation security is we're spending more on aviation  security than ever before. We had a $200 million announcement last year increasing  firearm and explosive detection dog teams by 50 per cent.

We've also ensured that we're going to have the Federal Police secure our major  airports entirely, so take full responsibility, a fundamental reform. We've also seen  the securing of cockpits on flights and changes and improvements to the screening  processes at our airport. So this government has done many improvements to  aviation security and will continue to have ASO officers on domestic and  international flights.

What happened yesterday was the shadow Attorney-General relied upon a stolen  document to disclose operational matters that may well endanger the lives of AFP  officers and the travelling public. This is playing politics with national security and I  call upon Tony Abbott to rebuke his shadow Attorney-General and desist from using  such information which may endanger the lives of Australians and the Australian  Federal Police.

JOURNALIST:   Do we still need air marshals?

BRENDAN O'CONNOR:           We will continue to have Air Security Officers both on  domestic and international flights but of course for national security and operational  reasons we will never disclose which flights and how many officers at what time.  That would defeat the purpose of the nature of this program. But I can assure you  that we will continue to have an ASO program that, along with the other significant  reforms and initiatives of this government, strengthens our protection to the  travelling public.

JOURNALIST:   Are you anticipating cuts to the program?

BRENDAN O'CONNOR:           I'm sorry?

JOURNALIST:   But are you looking at making cuts to the program?

BRENDAN O'CONNOR:           Well as we announced in the Budget, we have found  savings and we did so months ago. But of course what's happened since then is the  shadow Attorney-General has received a document that he would know to be  something that should not be disclosed publicly. And this is a person who wants to  be the next attorney-general of this country involved in national security matters  and he has chosen, for base political purposes, to use that document, to rely upon  that stolen document that may potentially endanger the lives of the Australian  Federal Police and the Australian public.

Now this is not an action of an Opposition that is ready for government. This is of  course following the decision by Tony Abbott to trash offshore processing. So we  have an Opposition that has now trashed border protection by opposing legislation  that will allow this government and future governments to have an offshore  processing arrangement for people smugglers and dealing with people smugglers  and the people smuggling crimes. And we now have had, as of yesterday, an  Opposition willing to rely upon stolen documents that will endanger potentially the

lives of AFP officers and the travelling public and that is a terrible thing that they've  done this week.

JOURNALIST:   If you say that we still do need air marshals but you are going to cut  them, how much confidence can the travelling public have?

BRENDAN O'CONNOR:           Well what we do is ensure that aviation security is a  major priority. That's why we have put more resources into aviation security than  ever before. As I say, a $16.5 million cut to aviation security in the Budget papers but  of course a $200 million increase in other areas. So we rely upon the AFP and others  to provide advice as to the best suite of initiatives that we can put in place to protect  the interests of the public.

So what have we seen since this government was elected? Well we've seen us accept  the Beale audit report on the Australian Federal Police, ensuring that they will take  over full responsibility of policing at our major airports. That's a fundamental reform.  We've seen a 50 per cent increase in the firearms and explosives dog detection  teams from 34 to 51 teams around the country - a very significant increase.

We've seen the securing of cockpits during flight, a very important change to the  way in which the planes are operating in the air. We've seen announcements by the  Minister for Transport also in relation to improvements of screening. So there's been  a whole array of initiatives and on top of that we'll maintain the Air Security Officers  program in order to ensure that we provide protection for the travelling public.

But I can assure you of this - any Opposition who thinks it's fit for government would  not be disclosing operational details of AFP activities if it wants to be a responsible  Opposition. This is trying to score a political point and at the same time in doing so  endangering potentially the lives of AFP officers and the travelling public.

JOURNALIST:   So can you anticipate any charges to be laid as a result of the AFP  investigation and who against, public servants or the MPs involved?

BRENDAN O'CONNOR:           Well I can say this - that the AFP Commissioner has  already indicated that he is investigating this matter and of course they'll be  determining whether in fact this matter should be referred to the Director of Public  Prosecutions. Now you would have thought the Opposition would have learnt a  lesson from Godwin Grech but clearly they're willing to rely upon information that  they know to be sensitive, that may endanger the lives of the AFP officers in  question and indeed may in turn endanger the lives of the travelling public. This is a  reprehensible act, an act of an Opposition that is not ready to govern.

JOURNALIST:   You also touched on asylum seeker policy, can you tell us about the  latest boat arrival? I understand that it was in distress. Do you know the  circumstances?

BRENDAN O'CONNOR:           I am aware that overnight ACV Triton and ACV Hervey  Bay interdicted a vessel north west of Scott Reef and did so at the request of that  vessel. They were requiring assistance. This vessel's arrival is just another reminder  that Tony Abbott has trashed offshore processing for base political purposes. Tony  Abbott has chosen to oppose legislation that will enable this government to have the  Malaysian arrangement put in place but he is so spiteful he's also opposed this  legislation which will mean if he is ever elected he will not be able to implement the  Nauru arrangement.

This is an Opposition Leader that puts his short term political interests ahead of the  nation's interests. We've seen it with border protection, we're seeing it again this  week with national security and I call upon Tony Abbott to rebuke the shadow  Attorney-General and desist in using operational information that may endanger AFP  officers and may endanger the travelling public.

JOURNALIST:   What's going to happen to the people on board that new boat from  [inaudible]?

BRENDAN O'CONNOR:           They'll be taken to Christmas Island.

JOURNALIST:   They’re supposed to be processed [Inaudible].

BRENDAN O'CONNOR:           As I've outlined in the statement I've released a little  while ago there are 51 passengers and as I'm advised four crew. They will be taken  to Christmas Island and they will be processed for security, health and identity  purposes. So there'll be no change to the operations insofar as that's concerned and  they will then be of course detained in Christmas Island as is the usual way of dealing  with these matters.

JOURNALIST:   Isn't Christmas Island already full?

BRENDAN O'CONNOR:           No it's not full, there's capacity in our centres as the  Immigration Minister's made very clear.

JOURNALIST:   Is this arrival the start of the flood that you spoke about on Thursday?

BRENDAN O'CONNOR:           Well what we did say is that upon the advice we've  received, if we do not put in place the most effective deterrent to smash the people  smugglers model there will be an increased likelihood of irregular maritime arrivals.  And every time we see a vessel arrive in this manner, it's another reminder to the  Australian public that Tony Abbott has put his personal interests ahead of the  nation's interests.

Now he should reconsider his position. Put this country first, Tony, and support the  legislation that will enable this government to put in place the most effective  deterrent against people smuggling.

JOURNALIST:   The boat was in distress, can you give us any details about that?

BRENDAN O'CONNOR:           I was only informed that there was assistance requested  and indeed the initial detection of the vessel was by a Dash-8 air surveillance and of  course that was followed up by assistance rendered by ACV Triton and ACV Hervey  Bay.

JOURNALIST:   Do you know where the people are from?

BRENDAN O'CONNOR:           I haven't been provided information with respect to the  ethnicity of the people on board at this point.

JOURNALIST:   Can I ask you about the arrest of an alleged people smuggler Sajjad in  Indonesia? Do you have any information on that, whether any charges have been  laid and whether we might be looking at extraditing?

BRENDAN O'CONNOR:           Look I can't confirm the details in relation to the alleged  arrest of a person this week by the Indonesian National Police but I can say this that  only last week the Indonesian courts jailed a people smuggler for five years using  their people smuggling laws. This is the first time these laws have been used.

This is where there are serious penalties, between five and 15 years jail for people  smuggling. It is a decision by the Indonesian Parliament and the Indonesian  Government that this government in Australia welcomes and indeed will continue to  work with the Indonesian National Police to see more arrests and ultimately more  prosecutions to take out the big fish, to take out the organisers of these ventures  because they place people in danger and many times too often that leads to the  death of people on these vessels.

JOURNALIST:   UN figures are showing now that actually Australia has experienced a  drop in asylum seeker numbers in the first half of this year, are you still predicting a  flood?

BRENDAN O'CONNOR:           Well what we've suggested was this - that as a result of  a number of levels of cooperation including disruptions in transit countries and  because of the tragedy on December 15 last year, there was of course a lull in the  way in which vessels would arrive and indeed we saw a reduction. And then of  course from the announcement of the Malaysian arrangement that we wanted to  put in place we saw a further decline.

So as a result of law enforcement cooperation in the region and because of a  number of other issues including disruptions by the INP and the Royal Malaysian  Police, we've seen a decline in these vessels. And then again as I say with the  announcement of the Malaysian arrangement on May 7 we saw a further decline.  But now that Tony Abbott has chosen not to support the Government implementing  an offshore arrangement we will start to see an increase in irregular maritime  arrivals.



And every time a vessel arrives Tony Abbott is responsible because he is a national  vandal, he has wrecked border protection by putting his personal interests ahead of  the interests of this country.

JOURNALIST:   Can I ask you about the Australian killed in Libya, do you know much  about that?

BRENDAN O'CONNOR:           I can't, you should refer that to the Foreign Minister.

JOURNALIST:   Just back on to the alleged people smuggler being arrested in  Indonesia, you're saying that you have confidence in the Indonesian court process to  effectively deal with such allegations?

BRENDAN O'CONNOR:           Well as I say, only last week we saw the jailing for five  years of a people smuggler. I mean this is very welcome and very important news  because this is the first time that the new laws that they brought in that has  criminalised people smuggling have seen a serious offender in people smuggling  brought to justice. And we welcome the efforts by the Indonesian Parliament,  Government and courts and indeed the Indonesian National Police for doing so.

Last week was a very important turning point in law enforcement in the region. We  applaud their efforts and I believe you'll see future initiatives by the INP and the  courts to bring to justice those people that commit these terrible crimes.

JOURNALIST:   Are there any other people who are being charged at the moment  under these laws or this next person the second one?

BRENDAN O'CONNOR:           As I say, the advice I've received is we've had someone  charged and prosecuted and jailed and we anticipate to see more because these are  relatively new laws and clearly from the jailing of the people smuggler last week we  can see they're acting upon these laws very effectively.

The Indonesian Government is working very closely with the Australian Government  on this trans-national crime and these laws toughen penalties and I believe you'll see  further arrests in the region and indeed further prosecutions.

I applaud law enforcement agencies in the region but particularly the Indonesian  National Police for their great efforts working very closely with the Australian  Federal Police.

JOURNALIST:   You're talking about more boats arriving, have you got any  information about more activity in the archipelago, is there -

BRENDAN O'CONNOR:           I can’t disclose intelligence and we will never disclose  intelligence. We can just say this, the agencies and advice we receive is that if we  don't have the strongest possible deterrent we'll see an increased likelihood of

irregular maritime arrivals. Now we'll do all sorts of other things, work closely with  Indonesian National Police, work closely with the Royal Malaysian Police, continue to  see disruptions.

There's been 8,000 disruptions in the last 20 months. There's been the jailing  recently of a people smuggler in Indonesia, only last week. These are very important  developments but we need to put in place the strongest possible deterrent and Tony  Abbott is wrecking border security by not enabling this government or future  governments to put in place an effective offshore processing arrangement.

JOURNALIST:   But he keeps offering an alternative being the Nauru solution,  wouldn't that do the same to deter boats?

BRENDAN O'CONNOR:           No, and as every expert has said, the Nauru solution as  it stands is not a deterrent. It didn’t work before. Everyone is aware that all the  people that were resettled were resettled here or New Zealand. People smugglers  know that, people getting on vessels know that, so to them it's just a closer island  than Christmas Island and they believe ultimately they'll arrive in Australia. That is an  entirely different arrangement than the one we've put in place with Malaysia.

The Department of Immigration says so; all law enforcement agencies say so. I mean  Tony Abbott doesn't listen to the economists when it came to the global financial  crisis, doesn't listen to the scientists when it comes to climate change, now he's not  listening to the national security experts when it comes to border protection and  other matters.

Clearly this man is not ready to govern and he should put his personal base interests  aside and put the nation's interests first and allow this government and future  governments to put in place the most effective deterrent against people smuggling.

Thank you.
