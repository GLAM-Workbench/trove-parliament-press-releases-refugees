INTERVIEW WITH KEIRAN GILBERT

SKY NEWS AM AGENDA

31 MARCH 2011

SUBJECTS: GST Review, Welfare Reforms, Bali Process

KEIRAN GILBERT:

Good morning and welcome to AM Agenda. Today we focus on the  Government's review of the GST amid claims from WA and Queensland  that they're getting a raw deal. The Prime Minister made the  announcement yesterday in Perth.

JULIA GILLARD (Audio):

The growth in mining is increasing the discrepancy in the amount of  revenue raised by States and Territories as well as making it more  difficult to anticipate GST distribution between States and Territories from  year to year. So we need a formula, a system, that better copes with  growth.

GILBERT:

Joining me on the program this morning from the SKY News Centre,  Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer David Bradbury and from  Brisbane the Shadow Minister for Small Business Bruce Billson.  Gentlemen, good morning to you both.

DAVID BRADBURY:

Good morning Kieran.

BRUCE BILLSON:

Good morning.

GILBERT:

David, with the GST review, someone has to miss out at the end of this.  Which State or States will be getting less of the pot at the end of this  review?

BRADBURY:

Well Kieran, we're not going to pre-judge the outcome of this review and  I think that it would be entirely inappropriate for us to do that. But we  have made a number of points and there are a number of things that we  all know have lead to this review being initiated. The first point to make is  that there are some incentives in place in the way which the  Commonwealth Grants Commission divvies up the GST that do discourage  States from undertaking economic reform and boosting their growth  within their own State. Clearly, we want to ensure that there is total  alignment between the incentives that are in place and the processes that  are used to determine allocation of GST revenue and what is in the  economic interest of the States and indeed as a consequence of that, the  economic interests of the nation.

GILBERT:

But there has got to be a loser in all of this doesn't there? If you're going  to reward economic growth and the States that are doing well, others are  going to miss out. That is the bottom line here isn't it?

BRADBURY:

Well as I said Kieran, we do not want to pre-judge the outcome of a  review that has just been initiated and there is a process for those that  are heading this committee which are enquiring into these matters to go  through. We think that there are important issues that need to be  resolved, which is why we've set out a comprehensive terms of reference.  There is a limited pie and the Treasurer has made it clear that we do not  intend to increase the GST. That is not one of the matters that on the  table of this review. But, not withstanding that, whether there are winners  or losers, that is something we're not going to get into an argument about  at this point in time. We want a process that engages the States that  gives them an opportunity to put their case, we will work through this  methodically and in the end we will be looking to make whatever changes  are needed after that enquiry occurs.

GILBERT:

Okay, Bruce Billson the Liberal Premiers have been supportive of this  announcement and yet Joe Hockey has come out this morning and late  yesterday and been critical of it saying that the Treasurer should  intervene now if he wants to make the changes. Doesn't it make sense to

get a bipartisan committee like Nick Greiner and John Brumby to look at  this in detail rather than rush off quickly and make the call?

BILLSON:

Well the interesting thing is you can understand the Premiers' sensing  maybe an opportunity to increase their share of the GST revenue, but  your opening question is absolutely right Kieran. If someone is going to  gain, someone is going to lose. It was only fourteen months ago that the  Grants Commission held a review into the distribution of the GST. If it is  such a compelling issue, why didn't the Government last February take  action on the review then? I think this is more about cryogenically  freezing this discussion whilst there is another review undertaken so that  any decision be pushed beyond the next election, tantalise the State  Premiers that there might be some prospect of revenue growth for them  and never talk about who is actually going to lose in making up that  revenue growth and then hopefully the Labor tactic is to simply put it off  to the other side of the next election.

GILBERT:

But Bruce, doesn't it again look like the Federal Coalition is showing  opposition and taking an opposing stance for the sake of opposition here  given that the Liberal Premiers are supporting it?

BILLSON:

I perfectly understand the Premiers' position Kieran. If I was a Premier  and there were prospects to re-carve the cake and get a bigger piece,  then certainly you'd want to give that a chance. But the reality is, it was  only fourteen months ago when there was a Grants Commission review of  this very subject, the distribution of the GST. Now, there has not been  some enormous transformational change since last February that means  all of that needs to start again. If there was a problem with the  distribution and the Government had an inclination to do something about  it, then it had all the opportunity to do it last February. This is a stalling  tactic to freeze the issue until the other side of the next election  recognising that it is a heart-felt issue. I mean Queensland ten years ago  were getting around 100c in the $1 per capita raised here now they're  getting back around 91c. The picture is quite different in Western  Australia. But to reapportion that pie, someone is going to have to miss  out and I suspect that's the conversation that the Government doesn't  wish to have and doesn't wish to open up until the other side of the next  election.

GILBERT:

Okay David Bradbury, what about that suggestion that you're putting this  off, which the decision is going to be made by the end of 2013, beyond  that if I could add to Bruce's criticism, what about the fairly blatant fact  that the Prime Minister made the announcement in Perth in a State where  Labor has struggled for many years and proving very unpopular in WA at  the moment?

BRADBURY:

Well Kieran, which State would you have liked her to have made it in?  This is…

GILBERT:

Doesn't it sort of indicate that it was for political purposes this  announcement?

BRADBURY:

Well I think that is to assume a certain set of outcomes arising from this  review. As I've said, we're not going to pre-judge what the outcome of  this process will be. I think the point you made Kieran is spot on that  when it comes to the Opposition. We see Joe Hockey here carping and  whining and criticising. Even from what Bruce has just said and I've got to  ask him the question, do you think there is a problem or not? The first  question that needs to be asked is, is there a problem? Are we entirely  happy with the current set of arrangements or not? And if not, how do we  go about trying to get a better alignment of National and State priorities  with the way in which the GST…

GILBERT:

Why not do it earlier though, David? Bruce is saying you're pushing it off  if there is a problem then why not deal with it sooner? As he mentioned  there was a review done recently by the Grants Commission.

BRADBURY:

And what was the outcome of that review? If we were going to simply  allow this to be a matter that we were relying on the Grants Commission's  advice, then there would be no need for this process. We think that it's  important that we have a process that engages with all the States. In  terms of timing of this, it's not going to effect that carve up of GST in the  next two financial years but certainly we're looking at its impact beyond  that. In terms of the election timing, that's obviously a matter that is still  in play and will be in play right up until the day that the Prime Minister  visits the Governor General but we are anticipating that there will be an  election in 2013. So, I'm not sure that all of this talk about timing is

making the point. The real issue as far as I can see, we've acknowledged  that there is an issue there and I think that people that have seriously  looked at this issue say that there are a couple of things that need to be  addressed. One, to the extent that the Commonwealth Grants  Commission might disadvantage a State because of the way in which they  are performing well economically then that should be addressed. The  second issue is that there needs to be greater predictability when it  comes to the way we manage allocations for States. That has not been  the case in the past, and we want to make sure that is the case.

GILBERT:

Okay, Bruce in answer to the question that David put I'll give you the  opportunity to respond to that, do you think there is a problem and what  about the suggestion that over time things even up? As you mentioned,  Queensland was a receiver for many years when it wasn't doing so well  and now, because of the balance of things, they are contributing to other  States.

BILLSON:

Yeah and those arguments are perfectly valid and those trends that we  see over a period of time must be taken into account. The Coalition is not  hostile towards the idea of a review, but if there is a debate about the  effort or the capacity for a particular State to raise their own revenue,  whether there is some prosperity displacement in the current formula. I  mean the insights and expertise of that are with the Grants Commission  and they've done that review fourteen months ago. So, there hasn't been  any transformational change in what's happened and the setting across  the continent in that period of time, the question is, what was wrong with  the Grants Commission process? They're the ones that have had to  manage and understand and receive these representations from the  States and Territories year in year out. They brought in that insight  together in their own examination of this very subject last February. Is  that work not of value or is the Government not happy with what the  Grants Commission is doing in its area of expertise which is to take  account of all the things David has been talking about?

BRADBURY:

So do you support the review or not Bruce? I'm a bit unclear…

BILLSON:

We're not hostile to the review, the perpetual review is not good policy…

BRADBURY:

Well what do you object to?

BILLSON:

Perpetual review is not a good policy. What I'm saying and what we've  clearly said is that there is an argument for review and we're not hostile  to that idea. We welcome the review, a need to re-examine the settings in  the Grants Commission formula, our point is that this was done fourteen  months ago. Was that not an adequate exercise?

GILBERT:

Gentlemen we're going to take a break just stay where you are, I want to  get the thoughts of former Liberal leader John Hewson who of course  famously tried to introduce the GST in the first place. John good to see  you, what do you think about this review being conducted by Nick Greiner  and John Brumby, the Liberal frontbencher there Bruce Billson suggesting  and articulating what Joe Hockey is saying, the Grants Commission did a  review fourteen months anyway.

*BREAK* Interview with John Hewson

GILBERT:

Welcome back to AM Agenda. With me on the program this morning from  Brisbane the Shadow Minister for Small Business and from the SKY News  Centre the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer David Bradbury.  David, the Opposition Leader Tony Abbott is going to give a speech to the  Chamber of Commerce in Queensland today, arguing the case for welfare  reform. One of the pieces of policy he wants introduced is in areas where  there is full employment but there is unskilled labour, like picking fruit  and so-on, that unemployment payments shouldn't be paid. What do you  make of that suggestion?

BRADBURY:

I think there are a couple of points to make, Kieran. The first one is that  this is not an agenda that is at all foreign to what the Government is  currently doing and proposing to do into the future as well and that is  when it comes to boosting workforce participation particularly where that  is required to meet the challenges of skill shortages and labour shortages  throughout the economy, that we are working very hard to develop  policies on that front. The other point to make is that we are seeing here  with Tony Abbott's proposals, which we're only seeing floated by I suspect  he'll have something further to say on this. We're seeing him respond to  what I think the focus groups are showing the Liberal Party and that is his  ongoing negativity, negativity that has lead to, in the latest Newspoll,  having a net satisfaction rating of -21% which is quite extraordinary,

really does demand that he step up and provide some policy responses. I  think it's interesting that we're here at the end of March and we're really  talking about the first policy proposal, and we haven't seen any detail yet  so I'm not even sure that it's worthy of that description, but we're talking  about the first policy proposal of the year. So I think that's a damning  indictment…

GILBERT:

Bruce Billson is this about Tony Abbott trying to be more positive, more  proactive rather than always wanting to tear things down?

BRADBURY:

I wouldn't characterise that as what Tony Abbott has been doing. The  Government's attitude is that if you don't agree with that they're doing,  you're a wrecker. We heard David say before the break that there couldn't  possibly be anything motivated by politics in the way the Grants  Commission issue is being handled but of course, this is all about politics.  This is just Labor Party 101. Tony Abbott has been committed, he's had  policies in this area and we took a comprehensive suite of policies to the  last election. This is an opportunity to present those and take them  forward to highlight how the Government has got some enormous  challenges here that they seem incapable of dealing with. There are more  than half of people on disability support pensions that have treatable  conditions and we should be doing all we can as a nation to support  people's return and engagement in the workforce. The idea that able  bodied people in regions of Australia where there is desperate need for  people with unskilled labour when there are people there receiving  unemployment benefits, we should do something about it. These are  sensible, practical ideas. The best thing the Government could do is pick  up these proposals that the Opposition has been advocating, recognise  that there is some positive form there from the Coalition in these areas  and see some of these initiatives included in the Budget.

GILBERT:

Another area that you've argued, a case for adopting your policies of  course was border protection. David Bradbury, the East Timor Solution  doesn't seem to be getting off the ground very effectively. There was no  real mention of the East Timor approach in the Bali Conference in recent  days and beyond that, the East Timor representative says that they don't  want it there.

BRADBURY:

There will always be nay sayers that focus on the negatives in these  matters. There were actually some really significant positives that came

out of this meeting and I think that it's worth just reflecting on what they  are. It's also reflecting on the fact that they are building on some other  positives. We've always said that this is a big challenge for the  Government, for the country and for the region. There are a lot of people  engaged in people flows and people movements across our region. These  are not problems that will be started or fixed in Australia, they will require  regional co-operation. What came out of the Bali Process meeting is that,  for the first time, we have regional partners signing up to work together  for a regional co-operation framework. That was one of the objectives  that our Ministers went to the meeting trying to secure. They always said,  don't expect us to walk away from this meeting with a regional processing  centre but we want to clear the way for further bilateral discussions with  our partners so we can move towards a regional processing centre. I also  make the point that the communiquÃÂ© did make a reference to a regional  processing centre, so it's not true to say there was no progress on that  front. The other point I'd like to make is that when we look at this and the  broader strategy, we can get caught up in the ‘stop the boats' rhetoric  that we've heard all about but one of the things that this Government has  done which is a really significant step forward has been the signing of a  return agreement with Afghanistan. This is something that had not been  done by any previous Government and for the first time we are now in a  situation where asylum seeker applications are being rejected from  Afghanistan and we will be in a position to be able to send those people  back to Afghanistan. That was a significant step forward, as have been  the other steps forward we've seen recently.

GILBERT:

Let's go to Bruce Billson. As David said there has been a mention of that  regional processing centre idea, not of East Timor itself but of the broader  regional co-operation. That is a step forward isn't it?

BILLSON:

I'm surprised David would mention the Afghanistan agreement where the  Government is trying to claim that it is one thing and the Afghani's are  saying ‘no it's not'. But let's put that to one side, the great thing about  communiquÃÂ©s is that all the participating countries look for a line or two  in there which they can take home to their domestic audience. That  hardly leads to a committed, co-operative undertaking of the parties that  are there particularly as it related to the regional processing centre. I felt  like giving the East Timorese Vice Minister a hug as he was interviewed  after this conference, the man is being stalked. These aren't talks with  East Timor, this is Australia stalking East Timor. He wasn't saying no we  don't want it here, he was pleading with the Government to stop  harassing him over the subject. He made it quite clear that the people of  East Timor aren't ready to cope with a facility of the size that is being  discussed. They've got new challenges as a new nation with 1 million

people ten years on, they'd look through the security fences of a  detention centre with standards that are far higher than the living  standards the East Timorese enjoy, he was pleading with Australia to back  off and stop stalking them about this. You can spin this anyway you want,  all you need to do is ring the President of Nauru, a country willing to take  up a regional processing centre role and get on with it.

BRADBURY:

You going to give him a hug too?

BILLSON:

If that would be helpful, sure.

GILBERT:

Okay, you've both had your say we're going to wrap it up. Thanks Bruce  and David, that's all for AM Agenda.
