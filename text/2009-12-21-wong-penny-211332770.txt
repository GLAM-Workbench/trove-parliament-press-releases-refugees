PW 372/09 21 December 2009  TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP INTERVIEW - ADELAIDE  SUBJECT: COPENHAGEN ACCORD, CARBON POLLUTION REDUCTION SCHEME  E & O E - PROOF ONLY  WONG: Thanks very much for coming. Well I’ve just arrived back from Copenhagen to a much warmer day than the weather I left. I just want to make some comments about what occurred at Copenhagen and also some of the commentary here in Australia.  The President of the United States described the Copenhagen Accord as an unprecedented agreement. Malcolm Turnbull described it as a major step forward. It isn’t perfect, but it is a crucial step. And the reality is in Copenhagen the world took a step forward. In contrast, Tony Abbott wants to respond by making Australia take a huge step back. Tony Abbott wants to shove Australia’s climate change policy into reverse gear.   Following Copenhagen, it is now important for countries to move forwards, not backwards. And the time is now, the time for action is now. We have to take action at home on climate change and we look at the fact that the Copenhagen Accord covers most of the world’s economy and a significant proportion of the world’s nations. 34 developed economies at Copenhagen either have, or are in the process of, developing trading schemes like the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. So the reasons for Australia to act remain the same. We are a hot and dry nation and are being hard and fast hit by climate change. Mr Abbott could do better than sitting on the sidelines and simply barracking for failure. Happy to take questions.  JOURNALIST: My opening gambit was to ask you was it a failure, so obviously you don’t think that?  WONG: I think I’ve responded to that really. It was a step forward. As President Obama said an unprecedented agreement. As Malcolm Turnbull said a major step forward. It’s not perfect but it is a step forward and we have to keep moving forward. We have to continue to progress action on climate change.  JOURNALIST: Do you think you can get a scheme through by February?  WONG: Ultimately that will be in the hands of Mr Abbott. Because it is Mr Abbott who has the numbers in the Senate to deliver action on climate change or to block action on climate change. And what’s clear is that he is more interested in blocking action. That’s consistent. He’s made it clear and the people who supported him made it clear that they will do and say anything to avoid taking action on climate change. Which is, frankly, completely irresponsible if you consider what Australia has to lose from climate change. We have a very strong interest in acting.  JOURNALIST: Abbott’s of the view that the result out of Copenhagen has (inaudible) his call for Australia not to have a scheme before you went to these talks.

WONG: Well Mr Abbott doesn’t want any scheme, let’s be clear. Mr Abbott is opposed to action  on climate change. He’s made that clear. The reason he got the Liberal party leadership is that he  was one of those arguing very strongly against action on climate change. So it’s unsurprising that  he’s maintained his position.

JOURNALIST: If the Government goes ahead with the ETS, is there any change after  Copenhagen to what the projected cost on families would be now?

WONG: We have, and I do want to respond to this, because we’re seeing Mr Abbott running  around engaging in a scare campaign, a baseless scare campaign. I think Australians know a scare  campaign when they see one. The Government put out last year our costings of what this policy  would cost. We are making polluters pay and the reality is unless you make polluters pay for the  pollution they put into the atmosphere, you’re not going to respond to climate change. And we  made clear that on average - and it’s an average - that this policy would cost around $624 a year.  And we on average will be giving back to Australian families $660.

If your question is what is Australia’s target going to be, that’s something we will work through  with other nations who have signed up to the Copenhagen Accord. We’ve put our target range out  there. It’s a very clear target range and it has a very clear set of conditions associated with it. And  that’s what we’ll be working through.

JOURNALIST:  Forgive me if I’m wrong Minister, I thought the cost was, wasn’t the cost about  $1100 per family?

WONG: No that is one of the incorrect figures Mr Abbott is utilising and he would do better in this  debate if he actually talked about the facts. The Treasury modelling last year made clear what the  average cost was. The Government has also made clear that nine out of ten Australian households  will be provided with assistance under our policy. Mr Abbott attacks that saying we are engaging in  redistribution. Well we think it is fairness. If you put a price on pollution for the first time, you  should assist Australian households - particularly low and middle income Australia - and that is  what the Government is doing.

JOURNALIST: How do you set the target for an emissions trading scheme and do you think you  will have to set that target by February as well?

WONG: We will work through with other nations who are members of the Copenhagen Accord  how we will go about setting our mid-term targets. But the Government’s range and conditions  associated with that range are very clear. As the Prime Minister said, the logic behind our targets is  very simple: we will do no more and no less than the rest of the world is doing.

JOURNALIST: So you think anything between five and 25 per cent?

WONG: I think I have answered the question. We have got a target range out there, a set of  conditions and we will work through with other nations, other countries that are part of the  Copenhagen Accord, the process of setting targets.

JOURNALIST: Are you concerned Minister, or maybe you haven’t had time to sort of get a feel  of it if you’ve only just got back. Certainly the perception in Australia of the summit, the average  joe would have got a perception of a chaotic sort of meeting. That had you know 45,000 people  trying to cram into a building that was designed for 15,000 or something. This was the general tenor  of the commentary or reporting throughout the duration. That must be damaging to the  Government?



WONG: The conference itself was hosted by the Danish Government. The conference centre  accreditation was handled by the United Nations. So I am not sure how that is…

JOURNALIST: I am talking about a general perception of the average joe punter in the street. The  perception was that the Government had so much hope for this conference. That wasn’t the  perception that seemed to come across. It seemed rather than being something aspirational and  something great, it just seemed like chaos.

WONG: Well it was a difficult conference. It was a conference where we spent, the nations of the  world for a whole range of reasons, spent less time negotiating than they should have. Australia did  all we could - all we could - in the circumstances. We worked extremely hard both at official level,  me as the Minister and then the Prime Minister to get an outcome. And can I say something about  that. I sat in a room; I think it was for about two days. Some of it was, one whole day with leaders  including the President of the United States - Barack Obama, Angela Merkel, President Sarkozy  President CalderÃÂ³n of Mexico, a whole range of other leaders. Watching as leaders argued to work  to ensure we could take action on climate change. Work to ensure we could have an agreement. So  the Prime Minister was at the table with those leaders working as hard as he can for this nation to  get global action on climate change. Meanwhile Mr Abbott is barracking for failure. So it is quite  clear who has got the national interest in mind.

JOURNALIST: Mr Abbott seemed to use colourful language again today in references to the  Prime Minister, Senator. In referring to Kevin Rudd, for what he sees as an overuse of the word  sceptic and denier, has likened Mr Rudd to (inaudible). What is your take on that designation?

WONG: Well I haven’t heard these most recent comments by Mr Abbott, so I am not going to  respond to them other than to say this. This is a debate about an issue that will affect generations of  Australians to come. It is therefore a debate worthy of an argument on the facts not an argument  that descends into that kind of talk.

JOURNALIST: I think that’s the point he’s made. That we are not dealing with practicalities, we  are dealing with articles of faith.

WONG: We are dealing with practicalities. That’s why the Government has spent so much time  and so much effort working through the practicalities with business, with the community, with  environment groups. We have a coherent policy, a sensible policy, a policy that deals with putting a  price on pollution and its consequences - that is, you need to assist Australian households. What  has Mr Abbott got? He has got a bunch of attack lines and a very bad scare campaign. That’s his  approach. We have a policy that is about doing something. He has a policy that is about a scare  campaign.

JOURNALIST: Did you walk away from Copenhagen feeling that there is a global plan now? Do  you walk away feeling confident in that regard?

WONG: Well as I said, this is a step forward but it is not perfect. And it is not everything we  wanted. What is good about the Copenhagen Accord is that for the first time major developing  economies like China and India have agreed that they will put their action forward and be  accountable for it. That is a change. The Kyoto Protocol doesn’t apply to developing economies.  But obviously we have got to do more and we will.

JOURNALIST: Tony Abbott suggested that bible studies should be compulsory for primary  school aged students. What do you think about that?



WONG: My view is that issues of faith and religion are deeply personal matters and that’s how  they should be approached.

JOURNALIST: And also just ahead of cyclone season, are you expecting an influx of asylum  seekers to Australia?

WONG: I couldn’t comment on that. You would have to address those questions to the responsible  minister. I would just say this, that obviously the Government has invested a very large amount of  money, a very significant amount of resources into securing Australia’s borders and remains  committed to an asylum seeker policy that is both tough and fair.
