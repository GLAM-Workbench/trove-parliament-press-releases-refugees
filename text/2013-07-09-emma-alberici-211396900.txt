EMMA ALBERICI, PRESENTER: During his time in State politics the  Foreign Minister Bob Carr spent 17 years as Labor leader. He has  tonight welcomed Kevin Rudd's plan to reform the way Federal Labor  leaders are chosen. Fifty per cent of the vote going to caucus while  the other 50 per cent rests with the rank and file members of the  party.

Even in Opposition that will mean that the Labor Party won't be able  to easily change leaders when the polls show they've lost popularity.

Senator Carr says that demonstrates a level of maturity that Federal  Labor has been lacking. The Foreign Minister is in Singapore and  joined me just a short time ago.

(To Bob Carr): Bob Carr, thanks for being with us.

BOB CARR, FOREIGN MINISTER: Pleasure, Emma.

EMMA ALBERICI: You're in Singapore en route to Myanmar where  among other things you will talk about economic opportunities for  Australia, what are they exactly?

BOB CARR: Well, a lot but my major purpose in going there is on  quite a different front and that is to speak up for the Rohingya, the  Islamic minority in Rakhine province who have a claim on being one  of the most persecuted people in the world. I think the happy  narrative of Myanmar's transition to a multiparty democracy, a free  state is now terribly compromised by the woeful condition of these  people who are denied citizenship and suffer systemic and legal  racist discrimination. There's a great deal of interest in it in Australia  and that actually is the top of my priority.

EMMA ALBERICI: And what can Australia do for those displaced  people?

BOB CARR: Well the first thing we do is assist them with emergency  accommodation. They're living in camps which apparently in the wet  season provide a shocking level of accommodation. We're providing  aid through three major international agencies to assist the condition  of the people though that intervention is not limited to the Rohingya  minority, however. We're helping all ethnic groups in that very  disadvantaged province. I want to point out to the leadership on  both sides of the political divide in (inaudible) that it is now seriously  harming the reputation of their country that all political parties,  including Aung San Suu Kyi's, are showing a resistance to properly  protecting the estimated 800,000 Rohingya in Myanmar.

EMMA ALBERICI: We've long seen the exploitation of workers in  developing Asian countries, what's stopping Myanmar now  becoming another Bangladesh?

BOB CARR: It needs - Myanmar needs economic growth. But we've  got to see that the OECD guidelines and the United Nations  guidelines to steer ethical growth into that country are adhered to  and that governs the approach we take. I'm pretty confident that  major Australian investors in that country as in other developing  countries, Mongolia, for example, adhere to ethical guidelines.  Indeed their reputations would be seriously damaged were they not  to.

EMMA ALBERICI: Given that this is a country that has been isolated  for so long, the United States, for example, is asking of its companies  that it provide public reports committing to respect for human and  labour rights for the environment and to sign up to anti corruption  measures. Will Australia consider following that specific lead and  actually requiring Australian companies to sign similar documents?

BOB CARR: Well, they're committed by Australian law not to practice  corruption.

EMMA ALBERICI: Hard to monitor, I suspect, when you're so far  away.

BOB CARR: Well, no, not always. There's been people prosecuted in  Western countries for breaching the laws of Western countries when  it comes to corrupt practices in the developing world.

EMMA ALBERICI: Let's move on to Egypt. There are now more than  50 reported deaths and 400 other people wounded. What does that  say about the role of the military in that country?

BOB CARR: Well, it certainly speaks volumes for the need for all  parties in Egypt, all sides to this gathering conflict to make a  commitment to cease violence. Demonstrations ought to be orderly  and peaceful and the security and police forces should not respond

with violence. It means as well, a very transparent commitment to  elections at the earliest possible time. I understand the interim  government has made a commitment to elections, interim president  Mansou to elections in 2014. I prefer elections before that. But the  guidelines and regulations that would govern elections ought to be  published as soon as possible. All sides have got a stake in those  elections being so fair that no one can harbour a grievance that they  missed out. Australia is not in a position where it's going to back any  military coup, any assertion of authority by non democratic means.  One's got to recognise, however, that there was clearly a very high  level of agitation in the country and it did appear to be going  backwards economically. President Morsi and the other leadership of  the Muslim Brotherhood should be released from detention  immediately. There is a requirement, and this is vitally important  from Australia's view point as well, to protect the minorities in the  country. It would be tragic if the Coptic Christians in Egypt, the  largest minority, were to feel that they were in any way especially  vulnerable in the political transformation that's going on and  involving tragically loss of life and threats of violence.

EMMA ALBERICI: What's it going to take, do you think, to stabilise  the situation in Egypt and what role does the US play to that end?

BOB CARR: It's very, very hard to say. We were hoping that the  revolution unleashed in Tunisia, Libya and Egypt in 2011 would see a  government elected by the people in Egypt go on to face the people  and to be the first government in Egypt's history having been elected  by the people to be re-elected or defeated as a result of a  democratic vote. That's with the democratic evolution of a country is  all about. Tragically that trajectory has been interrupted and I think  that says a great deal about the poverty of the country and about the  leaching of its institutions during the decades of Mubarak

dictatorship. It's very hard to say what is now required to see a  continuation of the happy maturation of a democratic Egypt that we  thought had been working itself out. But again, a commitment to  democratic elections, those elections to be under rules so  transparent and fair that even the losing side will recognise it as  having been a fair process. The release of political prisoners, respect  for minorities so that no section of Egyptian society feels threatened  or at any - in any way anxious about its rights and its position.

EMMA ALBERICI: Let's talk about the Labor reforms outlined by  Kevin Rudd yesterday. They give rank and file members 50 per cent  of the vote for leader. Under these rules it will be much more  difficult for Labor to change leaders both in Government and in  Opposition, is that always going to be a good thing?

BOB CARR: I think we've got to break this ridiculous culture of  replacing leaders when they're support in the polls falls. I speak of  someone who led the Labor Party in New South Wales for 17 years,  seven of those years were difficult years in Opposition. Many times I  was struggling in the polls but the party was mature enough to say  "we've made a long term commitment with Carr and we're going to  stick with him." That's a mature approach and it was a level of  maturity in the party that resulted in the removal of Kevin Rudd as  leader on the eve of the 2010 election, a sort of Biggest Loser reality  TV psychology that said "contestants - our leading contestant has  slipped in the ratings, we're going to chop his head off and bring in  someone else." I think breaking - ending that absurdist culture is  very helpful but I want to look, and the other helpful thing in it,  Emma, is giving rank and file members of the Labor Party something  that they would value more than the honour of working for the party  in elections and more than the honour of going to sometimes not  electrifyingly interesting branch meetings but the capacity to hold a

ballot paper in your hand and to plant a one in the box next to the  candidate who has got your support. I think it's a move that's going  to see a rejuvenation of the party membership. All political parties  are in decline. This could be an important step in rejuvenating Labor  Party rank and file life.

EMMA ALBERICI: Do you think it will entice more people to join up  to the Labor Party?

BOB CARR: I think it will. I think it will. As a Labor Party branch  secretary for more years than I care to remember but to be able to  say to a potential member, "by the way, one of the things that goes  with this is that you will get to elect the leader of the Australian  Labor Party in the Federal Parliament." I think we've got to go  beyond that though. I think we've got to take leadership training,  tutoring, nurturing, more seriously than we do and every  organisation in Australian society you've got a commitment to train,  to coach, to mentor political leadership. Only the political parties  think that you can muddle through with people who are never  systematically trained for the challenge of being ministers, being a  leader in opposition, having the skills and the talents, the disposition  required to lead your party through tough times. We don't take it  seriously. Mentoring, coaching and systematic training, the nurturing  of high quality, highly promising leadership material is taken for  granted in the corporate and the public sector world. The only  institutions, it strikes me, that don't do it are political parties. There's  not a training course held by the Labor Party or the Liberal Party for  recruits, say people in their 20s, who have got the promise of being  ministers. So we fluke it and we wonder why someone, when thrown  into a ministerial role, or even sometimes into the leadership, the  party in opposition finds himself or herself struggling. There's no

systematic development of the talents required and we're unique  among institutions in neglecting that.

EMMA ALBERICI: Finally, Bob Carr, how appropriate is it for you to  be sitting in judgment of Iranian asylum seekers?

BOB CARR: It's entirely appropriate for me to do what the Prime  Minister spoke about on July three on the '7:30 Report' and that is to  repeat what we've heard from our officials in the front line here.  Now, Emma, it's entirely inappropriate for you to adhere to a  political orthodoxy when it comes to discussing this question. I've  noticed this on ABC programs. Three facts stand out. The numbers  have spiked. Twenty per cent of Australia's immigration program  now comes to our shores courtesy of people smugglers. Second,  second, there's been a change in the composition of the people  coming here and that was striking in the most recent boat arrivals, as  I said two weeks ago when I was in Jakarta. A rise in the numbers, a  change in the composition and all of them, effectively all of them  being brought here by people smugglers. Now I'm not going to  remain silent and neither will any of my colleagues and see the  privatisation of the Australian immigration intake, to think that 20  per cent of our migrant intake is now delivered courtesy of people  grinning at us, bribing officials in other countries to get here,  plugging holes in their vessels filled for a time with a bung, a bung to  be pulled out and the vessel to be threatened with sinking when an  Australian ship hoves into view, all to make a profit from exacting  $10,000 a head from the wretched people on board these  unseaworthy vessels. That is wrong and it is an assault on Australian  territorial integrity…

EMMA ALBERICI: But we're specifically talking about…

BOB CARR: All our officials are telling us Emma, that the recent spike  has come from Iran and in their impression, in their impression,  they're the people on the front line, they're the people inspecting  the vessels, they're the people interviewing the people on the  vessels, it is overwhelmingly to gain economic advantage by coming  here. That is what you have a regular migration program for. This is a  corruption by people smugglers of what I would say is one of the  biggest and undoubtedly the most generous migration program you  would find in the world.

EMMA ALBERICI: There is a department, senator, a Refugee Review  Tribunal as well as the courts that make these determinations on  asylum claims but you have what appears to be absolute certainty  without any of these processes, don't you risk prejudicing these  asylum claims by so publicly dismissing their legitimacy?

BOB CARR: Emma, you're entirely wrong and again you have  misquoted me, because in Jakarta I said it appears that on the recent  boats 100 per cent of the people are seeking economic advantage  and are unable to make a claim for persecution. Now, the  Government has said "we've got a review of the way those  procedures work. It's legitimate to review it." I've got to say on the  face of it, it strikes me as worthy of investigation that 97 per cent of  people who reach Australian waters are allowed to stay as a result of  a process that seems weighted in favour of the claimant. I think  people who burn their passports and repeat what very often is a well  rehearsed story really ought to be put on the defensive rather than  Australian law and procedure put on the defensive when it comes to  determining status. If you've got an argument about persecution  there is no case for burning your passport and there's no case for  being rehearsed in a story of persecution so that everyone on a  vessel tells the same story word for word, leaving the impression

that the people smuggler in charge of the process has put them  through this. Now our officials are telling us this and I think the  Australian people would demand that the process be reformed. But  you're dealing with a very different situation when you've got what  could be 40,000 arrivals a year from what you dealt with in the early  2000s when there were a couple of hundred a year and when it was  a legitimate humanitarian response to say to allow them to slide  sideways into the Australian population. When it's 20 per cent of  your migrant intake being brought here by people smugglers I think  you've got to agree it's a different set of challenges.

EMMA ALBERICI: Bob Carr, we'll leave it there. We appreciate your  time this evening, thanks so much.

BOB CARR: Thank you, Emma.
