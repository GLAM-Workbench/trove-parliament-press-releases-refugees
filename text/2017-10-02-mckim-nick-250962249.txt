Media Release: Death on Manus Island

October 2, 2017

The death of a sixth man on Manus Island is another indictment on the Labor and Liberal policy of deliberately harming  people on Manus and Nauru, Greens Immigration spokesperson Nick McKim says.

“This is a case of catastrophic neglect by Peter Dutton,” Senator McKim said.

“The policy of deliberately harming people seeking asylum- which is shared by the Labor and Liberal parties - appears  to have taken yet another life.”

“This man had suffered for years in a system that Australia’s Labor and Liberal parties deliberately designed and  operated to cause mental harm.”

“Peter Dutton needs to end the torture and evacuate every single man, woman and child from offshore detention and  bring them to safety and proper care in Australia.”
