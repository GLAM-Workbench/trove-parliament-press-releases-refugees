INTERVIEW WITH FRAN KELLY

ABC RADIO NATIONAL BREAKFAST

WEDNESDAY, 14 APRIL 2010

SUBJECTS: Health reform, asylum seekers, Building the Education  Revolution

FRAN KELLY:

Our resident pollies: Financial Services Minister Chris Bowen is in Sydney  this morning and the Shadow Education Minister Christopher Pyne joins  me here in the Adelaide studios. Welcome to both of you.

CHRIS BOWEN:

Morning, Fran.

CHRISTOPHER PYNE:

Good morning, Fran.

KELLY:

Chris Bowen, let's start with you. The PM has hung his leadership on  health reform. He clearly wants that to be the centrepiece of the election.  If this deal with the states goes down in a screaming heap - and you'd  have to say that Victorian Premier John Brumby is not sounding like a fan  - what will be the political damage to the Government?

BOWEN:

Well, we're focused on getting a deal on Monday and beyond, Fran. This is  important. This is the biggest reform to the health system in generations  and we didn't expect it to be uncontroversial. If it was uncontroversial,  somebody else would have done it in the past. You don't expect, when  you're announcing such major reform, the Premiers just to line up one by  one and sign up. You expect tough negotiations and that's what we're  having.

But what we don't believe in is more resources without reform. The health  system needs more resources; it needs reform as well. We're not going to

just write a blank cheque and say, 'Well, here's a whole lot of resources  for the states but we're not interested in reform'. It was always going to  make the process more difficult and it's a process we're committed to.

KELLY:

Sure. Controversial is one thing, whether it's right is another thing, and  you may be committed but if John Brumby doesn't come around, the PM  has promised to take this to a referendum. Without a key state like  Victoria supporting it, and even worse, criticising it from the sidelines,  you're unlikely to get a referendum up either.

BOWEN:

Well, we'll deal with that if and when we come to it. I've seen the  premiers, other premiers, overnight make quite strong comments in  support. Mike Rann and Anna Bligh have been very supportive, and the  other premiers have been quite constructive.

But as I say, we are not going to give a blank cheque. And you know,  John Brumby has his plan out there, which calls for more resources.  That's fine, we're putting more resources in, but we also need reform and  that will be difficult but we are engaging with the states. We are engaging  with all of them, including John Brumby, including Western Australia, and  you know, we will be working very hard to try and get this deal upâ€¦

KELLY:

Okay.

BOWEN:

If the deal doesn't get up through the COAG, well, we've laid out that we  need to seek a mandate and there'll be more details about that.

KELLY:

Okay. Christopher Pyne, let me bring you in here. If the states support it  in the end, after COAG, will the Opposition then support it through the  Senate, and support it to a referendum on the other hand if the states  don't support it?

PYNE:

Well Fran, the problem with this - I'll answer that question, I'm not trying  to avoid it - but the problem with this whole health reform is that  basically, Kevin Rudd was looking at the polls at the beginning of this year  and things weren't travelling very well. He thought, 'What I need is an

enormous distraction, I'll propose a health reform and a health  referendum', but he hadn't lined up the state premiers.

KELLY:

What, just as John Howard did when he needed a distraction in the middle  of his first term and came up with a GST without telling his Cabinet?

PYNE:

Well, that was what, I mean -

KELLY:

That's what leaders can do.

PYNE:

That's 14 years ago, Fran. I mean, I'm not -

KELLY:

It worked for John Howard.

PYNE:

Well, we lost 17 seats in the 1998 election, so if the Labor Party loses 17  seats we'll be in Government. I hope the same thing happens.

In terms of these health reforms, well, the problem is they're not very  good. And it's one thing to sort of have this great media distraction, this  sort of spin cycle, as Kevin Rudd has created, but if the health reforms  aren't very good, why should people sign up to them? John Brumby and  Ken Baxter and Roger Corbett and Mr Deeble, who designed the - I think  it's John Deeble who designed the Medicare system - they've all said it's a  rubbish health reform that's not actually going to do anything other than  create more bureaucracy, potentially cost more money. It's not putting  any new money into beds, it's just essentially a political fix in an election  year. And the referendum -

KELLY:

I'm a bit confused now though. Didn't your leader, Tony Abbott, say  recently it seemed to be going in the same direction as the Coalition's  policy?

PYNE:

Well, we'll look at it. I'm just talking about the politics of it at the  moment. The politics of it was Kevin Rudd essentially trying to create a  distraction because his Government hasn't done anything, and that's been  the feedback at the summit, that it's a no action Government.

In terms of the referendum, the Government doesn't need a referendum.  This is just another distraction. Under Section 51 of the Constitution, the  Commonwealth has power over the funding of medical and dental services  already. He doesn't need a referendum. And under Section 96, which is  the funding of the states' power from the Commonwealth, it can basically  do whatever it likes because of the brawlings in court cases over many  decades.

KELLY:

Okay.

PYNE:

That's just another way of Kevin Rudd trying to look like he's tough  because everyone knows that he's not.

KELLY:

Okay. I'm sure that we'll be talking about this next Wednesday too, so  we'll move on because time is tight this morning.

Chris Bowen, the other big decision taken by the Federal Government in  the past week was to suspend asylum claims by Afghanis and Sri Lankans  arriving on Christmas Island. Yesterday on Breakfast, we spoke with  Afghan expert William Maley, who said there would not be one expert  around the world who would think the security situation for Hazaras in  Afghanistan has improved. Why are you right and he's wrong?

BOWEN:

Well, we think there are signs of improvement but we accept that the  situation in Afghanistan is serious. But the situation for Hazaras in  particular is looking like it has potential for improvement and that there -

KELLY:

Who have you talked to? Who has the Government talked to get to that  position? Not an expert like William Maley, not the UN, according to what  I've read.

BOWEN:

Well, when you look at the situation of Hazaras, it has been the case up  until now that they have almost automatic rights to asylum wherever they  apply, because the situation has been so dire. Now, in the advice that we  have from our officials, when you look at the UNHCR review of the  Afghanistan situation, when you look at US State Department reports, the  advice that we have is that that situation is improving, and that the  proportion of Hazaras who had received asylum may fall. Now, the  appropriate and prudent thing is to wait until you have all the information  before you to enable that to take place, and that's what we're doing, both  in Afghanistan and Sri Lanka. It's a prudent, sensible measure.

KELLY:

Christopher Pyne, I'm not sure why the Coalition wouldn't support this,  given that you have been saying that the processing of asylum seekers  has been too quick and too many people are getting in too quickly, with  not proper checks, and certainly under the Coalition they were held longer  in detention.

PYNE:

Well Fran, all we're getting from Chris Bowen this morning on asylum  seekers is words, words, words.

KELLY:

Yeah, but why don't you support the Government's plan?

PYNE:

Well, we think the Government has made a complete hash of our border  protection. We don't believe that they have a solution. They've come up  last Friday with a plan to delay processing, not a plan to stop asylum  seekers from getting to Australia. It's simply a plan to push off the  processing of asylum seekers until after the next election.

KELLY:

Yes, but you've been calling on the Government to introduce deterrents to  make it less speedy for people to get processed and given status here in  Australia. Doesn't that do that?

PYNE:

We've been asking the Government to introduce Temporary Protection  Visas, which the Howard Government had. I'll tell you what: between  2002 and 2007, there were virtually no asylum seekers arriving and no  boats arriving, and since August 2008-

BOWEN:

[inaudible]

KELLY:

Hang on, Chris Bowen, in a minute.

PYNE:

Since August 2008, there have been 110 boats and over 5,000 people.  Now, which policy has worked: the Howard Government's policies or the  Rudd Government's policies?

KELLY:

Chris Bowen?

BOWEN:

Well, Chris can claim that TPVs worked. Of course, they came in  substantially before then, and when TPVs came in the number of refugees  seeking asylum in Australia went up. And Christopher can argue, if he  wishes, that we should place people in limbo, that we shouldn't have  permanent refugee status. He can also argue, if he wishes, we should  push people off to far-flung Pacific islands and we should have children  under detention. He can make that argument as a small 'l' liberal if he  wishes.

We don't think that works, but we have adopted a prudent, sensible  approach. Now, he can, like his colleagues, politicise this issue, play dog  whistle politics if he wishes, but we'll just get on with the job of treating  people in accordance with their rights, but doing it prudently and  appropriately, and ensuring that we have all the information available to  us as we process them -

KELLY:

Okay.

BOWEN:

- by way of this suspension.

KELLY:

Okay. Let's move onto another issue that the Government's also moved  on to try and get off the agenda for a while, and that's the Building the

Education Revolution. The Minister has pushed that off to an  investigation, a taskforce.

Chris Pyne, we've had some response to the interview that you did with  Geraldine Doogue on Breakfast yesterday, where you said that as much  as half of the $16 billion could have been wasted. You said $8 billion of  value for $16 billion of spending. Some listeners are wondering where you  get that figure, how you come up with that.

PYNE:

Well, we would like to actually, we'd actually like to know the figure  exactly and that's why we are concerned. That's why we are concerned  that the Auditor-General's inquiry is not inquiring into value for money.  We're concerned that this taskforce is not inquiring into value for money.  The NSW audits are not looking at value for money. Where we get that  figure from, though, is that in almost every example we've seen the  inflated price is at least 50 to 100 per cent. For example, the Berridale  Primary School went from $285,000 to $908,000.

KELLY:

So you've extrapolated from a few examples?

PYNE:

We have to because the Government won't give anybody any figures. It's  like Chris Bowen's claims this morning about all these documents saying  the Hazaras are apparently living on a beach in Afghanistan and enjoying  themselves, an inland beach obviously. Where are the documents? Why  doesn't the Government give us the figures about how much money's  been wasted?

KELLY:

Okay. We're in a bit of a timing jam now, because Christopher Pyne is  supposed to get the last word for this week but I'm going to have to give  him two in a row for next time.

Chris Bowen, just an answer to that briefly, Chris?

BOWEN:

Well, of course there are 24,000 projects across the country in the BER,  Fran, and if even every example that Christopher Pyne has raised, and  The Australian newspaper have raised, if every example was true - which  I don't accept because clearly some of them have been shown, proven to  be untrue - then that would be less than one per cent of the projects.

PYNE:

So it's going really well?

BOWEN:

And Christopher, you couldn't even name one problem in your electorate.

PYNE:

So it's going really well?

KELLY:

Can you name one problem in your electorate?

PYNE:

I'll tell you what, I can name three schools but they are too intimidated in  allowing their names to be put forward because of the bullying that's gone  on from state education departments in New South Wales, Victoria and  South Australia. And I'm not, as a local member, going to damage those  schools or those principals.

BOWEN:

He cannot name one school.

PYNE:

And so you think that I should damage the schools, do you, Chris Bowen,  as a local Member of Parliament?

BOWEN:

I was talking to a local principal in my electorate yesterday who was  raving about the BER -

KELLY:

Okay.

BOWEN:

- and what a boost -

PYNE:

Yes, there's no problems with it at all, are there?

BOWEN:

If you look at the vast majority, the vast majority of principals and P and  Cs across the country, they all tell you the same thing.

KELLY:

Okay. Now we've got to leave it there, Chris Bowen, we're out of time.

PYNE:

Blah, blah, blah.

KELLY:

Chris Bowen and Christopher Pyne, thank you very much for joining us on  Polls Apart.

BOWEN:

Good on you.
