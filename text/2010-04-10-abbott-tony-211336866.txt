TONY ABBOTT:

It’s good to be here with Sussan and with Sophie on the Hume Weir wall. We’ve had a very instructive, for  me at least, briefing from people involved with the catchment, with irrigators, with experts on water  management this morning. For me, the beauty of these sorts of briefings is that it’s one thing to read the  documents, to read the papers, to study the issue in an academic way, but to hear from people whose  livelihoods depend upon this water makes the whole thing real in a way that it can easily be a bit unreal  talking about these in a policy context in Canberra.

I think that there is one message that I got this morning loud and clear and that is that we do need an  irrigation sector. The Murray-Darling is responsible for a very high percentage of Australia’s food  production. It is the bread basket of our nation. It does require the continued use of irrigation and certainly  I’d want to assure the irrigators of the Murray-Darling basin that they will have a strong future under the  next Coalition government.

The other issue that I probably should just say a few words about is border protection. What the government  announced yesterday is not a solution, it’s an election fix. The test of what the government announced  yesterday is will it stop the boats and even the Labor Party doesn’t think that it will stop the boats. People  inside the government are admitting that they have lost control of our borders. This is a long-term disaster  for our country and obviously there is a very sharp contrast between Mr Rudd who found a solution and  created a problem and former Prime Minister Howard who found a problem and created a solution and the  tragedy is that Kevin Rudd wouldn’t leave well enough alone, he had to big note himself by changing  policies that worked and since then we have a situation developing where instead of three boats a year we’re  now getting three boats a week and there is no likelihood of that flow slowing under these changes which  the government has just announced. I might ask Sophie and then Sussan if they’d like to say a few words.

SOPHIE MIRABELLA:

Without this region there isn’t a water supply for the Murray-Darling basin so it’s utterly appropriate that  local farmers and local water experts had an opportunity to discuss quite frankly with Tony some of the  challenges and some of the issues and concerns that we have because to plan for viable agriculture, viable,  efficient use of water  we need a vision and we need a plan and we need to hear from people who have direct  knowledge and are directly affected, so thank you Tony for making the effort and I know that will have  direct input into Coalition policy.

TONY ABBOTT:

Sussan?

SUSSAN LEY:

Thanks Tony, for coming here to the Hume Weir wall and the Murray River. The irrigated agricultural  sector will be warmed by your words of support and we’re terribly disappointed with Penny Wong and the  Rudd government’s approach to water management. They’ve shown disregard for our farmers, disregard for  efficient water management regardless of where the water goes and every which way we turn, we feel that  the current government is letting us down. So, to support farmers, food, agriculture and, really, the very  smart way of farming that we see in the New South Wales and Victorian Murray Valley is something that  Australians should all treasure and we look forward to inputting as Coalition members to a plan that works  so much better than the Rudd government’s.

TONY ABBOTT:

Alright, any questions?

QUESTION:

I mean, your words of support. How does that translate into actual action?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I think if you look at the record of previous Coalition governments, we have strongly supported the  farm sector, we’ve supported the irrigation sector as part of the farm sector and I’m confident that in the  months leading up to the election, we will be able to provide the irrigators of the Murray-Darling basin with  the reassurance that they need.

QUESTION:

The Ute Muster shirt, have you been to the Ute Muster?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look I haven’t but Vicky and Russell from Deniliquin were very keen to make a little presentation to me  and when you’re on one of these bike rides you don’t have too many shirts, so when you get a new one you  wear it.

QUESTION:

How is the ride going?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, for me, this is one of the highlights of my year. It’s been going for 13 years now. It’s the third time  I’ve been in Albury as part of the Pollie Pedal, I was here first in 2002 which was Sussan’s first Pollie Pedal  ride, I was here again in 2008 and now in 2010, but the beauty of this ride is that apart from raising money  for a good cause, apart from promoting cycling as a healthy means of transport under the right  circumstances, you see and meet people in a different way when you’re doing it like this as opposed to just  jumping off the plane in your suit and then jumping out of the white car for meetings in people’s offices.  Now, I think that there is a more candid and a more constructive dialogue on this trip than you normally get  because I think that there’s just a sense that we’re all on the same level. I think that’s the great thing about  the discussions that you have during this Pollie Pedal - everyone is on the same level in a way that I think  politicians don’t always give that impression in many of their meetings.

QUESTION:

How does getting on a bike make you on the same level as someone?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well there’s no artifice, there’s nothing grand about staying in the caravan park and travelling around the  countryside by bike, so this whole culture of the politician from Canberra I think is eroded by the sort of  thing that happens on the Pollie Pedal.

SOPHIE MIRABELLA:

Meeting people in a pub without a whole media entourage but just to meet people to hear what they have to  say directly to you without anyone else listening is invaluable. It’s not a media opportunity, it’s not some  line and some image to project, it’s actually speaking to people directly in a real way. You don’t get that,  particularly for country people, they don’t have that opportunity and this is absolutely critical and Tony’s  met hundreds of people so far in the last two days in my electorate and he will have met more real people  speaking directly to him in three days than Kevin Rudd would meet in three months and that says it all.

TONY ABBOTT:

Alright, thanks Soph, thanks Sussan.
