6 October 2011

TRANSCRIPT OF THE HON. TONY ABBOTT MHR,  INTERVIEW WITH JONATHAN RIDNELL,  ABC RADIO CENTRAL VICTORIA

Subjects: Visit to Bendigo; jobs forum; border protection; taxation.

E&OE……………………….…………………………………………………………………

TONY ABBOTT:

Jonathan, thank you for having me. Nice to be on the programme.

JONATHAN RIDNELL:

Now, basically, Elmore to do a doorstop and to meet some people but I guess that in some ways what’s been  making news this morning is the forum that you are holding at 11 o’clock in Bendigo. Invite only. Has that  opened you up to some criticism that you are only asking people who you want to hear from?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think that would be unfair criticism Jonathan. It’s the sort of thing you’d expect from the Labor Party  which doesn’t have any forums at all but look, my understanding is that Senator Ronaldson invited over  1,000 people and I believe the invites went to local community groups, swinging voters, a whole range of  people and basically they were accepted on a first in, best dressed basis.

JONATHAN RIDNELL:

Ok, and why would you spend your time in Bendigo listening to that group of people, two years out from an  election?

TONY ABBOTT:

Because you never know when the next election is going to happen. This is a very fragile government.  Kevin Rudd is reportedly talking to his colleagues and he’s reportedly telling them that if he becomes the  leader there will be an election sooner rather than later. But in any event, this government is in a very fragile  position and good oppositions are always ready for an election but the other point I should make is that we  don’t want people anywhere in Australia to feel that the Liberal Party isn’t making a serious effort to speak  to them and if possible to represent them. We have represented Bendigo before and I hope we might do  again.

JONATHAN RIDNELL:

In some ways, is the timing of this about the fact that Steve Gibbons has announced that he is retiring as the  Labor member of Bendigo at the next election and so in some ways, that incumbent percentage of votes  pops out the window and this is a good chance to win Bendigo?

TONY ABBOTT:

Inevitably, Jonathan, when a long serving member retires, there is more opportunity for the other side to do  well. I think that when a long serving member announces he is quitting, the work rate inevitably drops, the  focus inevitably drifts and I think that inevitably causes a bit of local discontent. So let’s try to ensure that  from our side of politics, we’ve got a good strong local candidate, we’ve got a good strong local campaign  which chimes in with a good strong national campaign.

JONATHAN RIDNELL:

And back to the forum. Gosh, I forgot the question. Let me…Nope, it’s gone. Anyway, let me know, if you  don’t mind, turn to a couple of national issues, if that’s ok.

TONY ABBOTT:

Sure.

JONATHAN RIDNELL:

And it’s amazing how word of your visit to Bendigo spread to Canberra but a couple of questions there.  After the announcement of the jobs forum today, just a couple of yes or no’s - do you support mandating  local content rules for mining or construction projects so that we really encourage them to source Australian  product?

TONY ABBOTT:

I don’t support mandating.

JONATHAN RIDNELL:

Ok. Should businesses with local content, who use local content and local manufacturers get a tax break?

TONY ABBOTT:

Again, I would be very reluctant to support new tax breaks without carefully considering all the fiscal  implications and also the implications as to fairness. I mean, I want to see Australia’s manufacturing get a  fair go on a level playing field but I think the best way to do that is to get taxes down, to get regulation  down, to get government spending under control and frankly Jonathan, if people are serious about boosting  manufacturing, they’ve got to be talking about the carbon tax and urging the Government to get rid of it  because the carbon tax is going to be an act of economic self harm. It’s going to place our manufacturing at  a serious competitive disadvantage vis-a-vie the rest of the world.

JONATHAN RIDNELL:

Ok, and also the jobs forum, I believe the ACTU is calling for the skilled migration programme to be wound  back to give more opportunities to retrenched manufacturing workers and again, as far as creating that kind  of environment, where do you come from?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I don’t support that. Obviously, I want to see people given a fair go and I think that the average  Australian employer is only too happy to give locals a fair go. I don’t think any rational employer is rushing  to bring people in from overseas if you’ve got workers who can do the job here in Australia.

JONATHAN RIDNELL:

Ok, and one last national issue before I ask you that question about the forum, I’ve just remembered, and  that is yesterday you mentioned maybe turning back asylum seeker boats. Is it a policy to turn back asylum  seeker boats?

TONY ABBOTT:

Always has been our policy, always will be our policy to turn boats around where it can safely be done.

JONATHAN RIDNELL:

Ok, and finally I was going to say a Bendigo forum which has been organised by the Liberal Party, you’re  looking forward to meeting decision makers and people suggesting ideas. What’s different about that to say  the tax forum of the last few days where you really haven’t been that welcoming, I suppose, of that  particular forum on tax?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, there’s a world of difference between being in opposition and being in government and the job of the  government is not to organise debating societies, the job of the government is to give us good policy. The  trouble with this government, Jonathan, is that the changes they’re making are all bad ones. The carbon tax  is going to hit jobs, it’s going to hit people’s cost of living; the mining tax is going to hit investment; the  National Broadband Network is a $50 billion plus white elephant. I mean, this is a government which is just  brilliant at wasting money and it tries to cover up its waste with spin. I think that it was pretty clear that the  tax forum has had no meaningful outcomes and I think just reinforces people’s impression that this is a  government which just doesn’t know what it’s doing.

JONATHAN RIDNELL:

Does that mean that tax reform is not on your agenda or does that mean that forum for tax reform was not on  your agenda?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, two points Jonathan. The first is the best way to help the tax system at the moment is to stop the  carbon tax and stop the mining tax. The second point is that you can’t have meaningful tax reform without  getting spending under control because if government spending is out of control tax reform is a euphemism  for tax increases and if you want lower, simpler, fairer taxes you’ve got to do it on the basis of lower  government spending.

JONATHAN RIDNELL:

And perhaps as a final welcome to Central Victoria, we’re very proud of our sort of contribution to Canberra  since Sir John Quick helped draft the constitution a hundred and something years ago. I’m sure that by the  time that you leave Bendigo you will have a wonderful framework for a policy to take to the next federal  election.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, we’ve already got a lot of policy out there. For instance, there’s our six point plan for a more  productive economy which involves higher workforce participation, more productive public institutions, red  tape reduction, more of a level playing field for fair competition, better value infrastructure spending and a  more flexible workplace. So we’ve got a lot of policy out there and apart from anything else, Jonathan, if  people want to know how we would be in government they can look at how we were in government. I don’t  say the Howard Government was perfect but compared to the current mob it was a model of efficiency and  execution.

JONATHAN RIDNELL:

In that case the voters will decide, well, anywhere between a couple of months and a couple of years from  now. Mr Abbott, hope you find Central Victoria both interesting and educational. Thanks for joining us.

TONY ABBOTT:

Thank you Jonathan.
