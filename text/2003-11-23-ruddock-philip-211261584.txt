OPPOSITION CONFUSION OVER BORDER PROTECTION

The Opposition is again contradicting itself over border protection and national  security the Attorney-General Philip Ruddock said today.

The former Opposition Leader Kim Beazley is reported, in a speech overnight,  to  have made comments linking unauthorised boat arrivals and possible terrorism," Mr  Ruddock said.

In the speech Mr Beazley is reported as saying that small boats could carry  ‘…terrorists with a mind to roll a few sea mines over the side.” (Sunday Telegraph 23/11/2003)

“This conflicts with Labor’s position during the last election campaign when Mr  Beazley dismissed links between boats and terrorism when appearing on ABC TV on  the 25th of September 2001,” Mr Ruddock said.

“The Shadow Attorney-General Robert McClelland told the Sunday program earlier  this month that terrorists could be coming in with unauthorised boat arrivals,  thereby posing a threat to Australia.

“these boats…could be carrying terrorists.” (Ch9 9/11/2003)

“Yet the next day on commercial radio in Perth, Mr McClelland distanced himself  from that statement.”

“I think it is fanciful to suggest that terrorists are going to come out here and claim  asylum seeking status - why? - because they will be detained for a period of time  under our laws…”  (6PR Drive 10/11/2003)

“Quite clearly the Opposition doesn’t know what it stands for.

"The Government has always taken the view that we need to be prudent and have  appropriate measures in place to protect the Australian community across a range of  possible threats,” Mr Ruddock said.
