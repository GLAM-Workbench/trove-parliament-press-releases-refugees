PETER BEATTIE:

Peter, good to see you.

PETER MCGAURAN:

Hi Peter.

PETER DUTTON:

Good to see you, Peter’s, how are you?

PETER BEATTIE:

Good mate, very good. Peter over the weekend we saw that it's now 1000 days  since the last unauthorised boat arrival, so congratulations. You and your colleagues  at the Department of Immigration and Border Protection have saved lives no doubt.

PETER DUTTON:

Yeah well thank you Peter. It's right to pay tribute to the men and women of the  Australian Defence Force and there are 16 agencies in total involved in Operation  Sovereign Borders. Staff from my own Department in the Australian Border Force  are exceptional officers, they're professional and when you speak to them and hear  the stories about when they were pulling bodies out of the water, half eaten torsos,  young kids who had drowned on that perilous journey - they don't ever want to  return to those days and none of us should. We've been able to keep our borders  secure, we've closed 17 detention centres and we've got every child out of detention.

And as you know, when the Howard Government left office in 2007, there were only  four people in detention including no children and 50,000 people came on 800 boats  and 1,200 drowned at sea.

The important thing to realise though is the threat just hasn't gone away. We've  turned back 30 boats containing some 765 people over the course of that last 1000  days and had those 30 boats got through, I promise you this, that there would have  been 300, 3,000 that followed. And this problem will not go away because people will  always want to come to a country like Australia and this Government has the resolve  to make sure that we stare these people smugglers down and we're just not going to  - we're not going to step back from that resolve.

PETER MCGAURAN:

True Peter and I think all fair-minded and pragmatic Australians take that approach.  Your problem is obviously Manus Island. What a relief it was to see Vice President  Mike Pence honour the agreement, however reluctantly. But even if the Americans  take a substantial number, even all of the political refugees from Manus Island,  you're still left with the issue of relocating a large number of economic refugees. How  are you going to do it?

PETER DUTTON:

Well the first point's the most important one Peter and that is that this Government  didn't put people on Manus or Nauru. I mean we have inherited a mess and you're  right it's our job to clean it up and were doing that.

So when Mr Rudd signed the agreement with the PNG Government there was no  arrangement as to what would happen to people at the end of the first year or the  second year or the third year. It was open ended and so we still operate under that  arrangement, but we have brokered an agreement to the credit of the Prime Minister,  then President Obama and now to the credit of President Trump and Vice President  Pence as you point out.

They have said that they will honour that deal. That provides us with some hope of  moving some people off Manus and off Nauru. But ultimately there are a number of  people that have been found not to be refugees, they're not owed protection and the  onus is on them to return back to their country of origin because a key part of our  success in stopping drownings at sea, getting all of those kids out of detention and  keeping our borders secure is that we have not allowed people to come by boat to  Australia.

We've been very clear that if you've sought to come to Australia by boat you will  never settle here and that applies to people on both Manus and Nauru and it's a key  part of the reason as to how we have, at least for this period of time, broken the  people smugglers' model.

So we'll work with third countries, we'll work with the PNG Government. Under the  agreement that Mr Rudd signed with Prime Minister O'Neill, it was the arrangement

that people that had been found to be refugees would settle in PNG and that is still  our expectation.

PETER MCGAURAN:

But Peter, political refugees is the agreement with Papua New Guinea, not economic  refugees I presume?

PETER DUTTON:

Well people that have been found to be refugees under the 51 Convention and the  67 Protocol, so those people that are fleeing persecution. But Peter, as you say and  as the UN points out, there are some 65 million people around the world that  understandably want to come to a different country to make a go economically, or  take their kids into a better university, or a better health system. All of us as parents  would want that, but as we're seeing in Europe and as we've seen here in this  country, sovereign countries have the right to exert control over their borders. That's  what we've done.

We are bringing people in through the Refugee and Humanitarian Programme. You  would've seen over the last couple of weeks a celebration within the Yazidi  community. Those people were facing persecution because of their religious belief  and essentially were facing genocide from ISIS. We were able to bring those people  in the right way, to provide them with support to start a new life in our country and  that's the way that this Government chooses to operate its migration programme, not  by allowing people smugglers to be in control, who dictate to the government of the  day how and when and in what circumstances people arrive into our country. And  we're just not going to tolerate that to be the case and we've been very clear about it.

PETER BEATTIE:

Peter I noticed a report, which you may or may not be aware of, from a guy called  Ron Knight who is the Member for Manus Island who basically says that the asylum  seekers not taken by the Americans he wants declared as illegal aliens and then  deported. And obviously whenever there's a report like that there's some suggestion  they may come to Australia. If that did happen, what ramifications would that have to  the policy the Government's pursuing in the agreement?

PETER DUTTON:

Well Peter it's a good point. If you allow people to come to Australia then the people  smugglers are out there again saying, ‘look you only have to wait on Manus or Nauru  a couple of years, you're going to Australia, pay your money.’ And all of the  intelligence that I receive from across the region in terms of the people smugglers  activity is that they're out there pitching every day, to say, ‘look you go to Nauru for a  couple of years, eventually you'll end up in Australia. You go to Manus, you're going  to end up in Sydney or Melbourne or Brisbane eventually.’

The boats would be back in business and we can't afford that because, as I said  before, we're not going to have women and children drowning at sea. We're not

4

www.minister.border.gov.au



going to have loss of control of our borders and our detention centres refilling  because we can't verify identities of people who are coming in when they're told by  people smugglers to destroy their passports. All of that is just unacceptable at every  level.

And so we would see a re-emergence of the boat trade, the flotillas starting up again  and that's why we've been very clear, regardless of what this person or anyone else  says, they can hear this message very clearly from the Government, from the Prime  Minister and myself; they are not going to settle in Australia under any  circumstances.

And we'll help them, we do now and hundreds of people before them have taken  settlement packages to go back to their country of origin and these people need to  do the same.

PETER BEATTIE:

Peter the argument about, or the debate which you've seen which has been running  over the last couple of days in relation to the Good Friday shooting on Manus Island.  How is that resolved? I mean we all understand politics and the debate that takes  place. I know there's an inquiry which is happening, an investigation, how does that  resolve in terms of what actually happened in terms of your position on it? I mean  clearly you don't want this hanging around as some area of doubt in terms of what  you've been told and what happened, so how do you get that resolved?

PETER DUTTON:

Well Peter, when you've got the ABC and others who are relying on the reports and  the accounts of people that have been convicted of fraud and have been excluded  from Parliament - they're taking their word over the word of the Australian  Government - then I frankly think the ABC has lost the plot and I think they should  be out apologising. The trouble is Peter, in relation to a lot of the journalists, they've  morphed into advocates and they've lost control of any dispassionate view of this  circumstance.

What I said is factual. I stand by it 100 per cent and I'm not going to be cowered into  a different position when I know what I've said to be the truth. And I'll stand by those  comments and I expect the ABC and Fairfax and others to be making an apology in  the next 24 hours or so given the revelations that have been released tonight in  relation to their discredited witness.

I believe very strongly that there was a ramping up of the mood - of the tension on  the ground. We have seen allegations and charges in relation to a number of sexual  assaults.

And the fact remains that a number of males who were within the population on  Manus Island were involved in leading a young boy into the detention centre and that  matter is being investigated.

5

www.minister.border.gov.au



And If somebody from the ABC or from Fairfax or the Guardian or some of these  fringe dwellers out in the internet have a different view, a more substantive view, a  more informed view, then let them put it on the table.

But I've provided the facts as they've been advised to me by my Department and  those people with knowledge of what's happened on the ground. And I'm not  changing my position, my version, one bit because the advice that I've got I've  reconfirmed again today.

And these people can take the word of somebody that's been discredited, but that is  an issue frankly for the credibility of the ABC, Fairfax and others and I think they  need to reflect on their position, because they've really turned into advocates as  opposed to professional journalists.

PETER BEATTIE:

So you stand by what you've said on this form the beginning?

PETER DUTTON:

100 per cent. 100 per cent.

PETER BEATTIE:

Now Peter, we also wanted to move on to 457 visas and one area which you know I  have a particular interest in is universities. And I notice you've sort of left the door  open in terms of the definition of work experience for PhD students coming here and  indeed the definition of work. So how will you deal with that? Because they are  obviously important to our universities and I've seen reports where you're thinking  about this. So what is your thinking and where do you think we can go in relation to  universities and the concerns they've raised about this?

PETER DUTTON:

Yeah well Peter, before I make that point, I mean full credit to you, the work that  you've done with Queensland Brain Institute, the Queensland Uni and the rest of it. It  was a big agenda of your government. I didn't agree with everything that you did as  Premier, but I think you've covered yourself in glory in terms of the work you've done  with universities. And Peter Hoj and others, I've been out, we've provided funding  when I was Health Minister and otherwise to projects that they're doing around the  brain and dementia, Alzheimer's and the rest of it, which is a real scourge on  Australians and will increasingly be so. So I think there's some great work being  done at other institutes around the country. They're just some of the most amazing  people and make you so proud to see the research that they're doing.



So we've built in deliberately to the changes in the 457 programme. When we  abolished the 457 programme we allowed twice yearly examination of the skills list.  There will be skills that will come on, others that will go off, because we rely on the  advice of the Department of Employment. But we've had constructive discussions

6

www.minister.border.gov.au



with the Group of Eight and the universities otherwise about some concerns that  they've got and I'm sure that we can work through those.

But what we don't want is a situation where people really aren't selling the virtue of  that job; they're selling a migration outcome. So under the old 457 programme, once  you'd done your four years, really there was written into the programme the ability to  become a permanent resident and then a citizen. Now we need to have a look at that  and whether or not that's the motivation for people to be taking up that position or  whether, not universities, but some training organisations are using the citizenship  outcome as a marketing tool. I'm just not sure that's the proper use of the system.

And so we're happy to have a look at individual cases and circumstances and  grievances that people bring up, but the fundamentals remain.

PETER BEATTIE:

So with a university professor, they could go off the list depending on how you feel  about it, how you feel that's being used by the universities?

PETER DUTTON:

We take the advice from the Department of Employment. The Department of  Employment does an assessment of where there is a skills shortage within the  Australian workplace and that's the advice that I need to rely on. But if there's  additional information that the universities or others can provide to the Department of  Employment, as I say, we've built in a twice yearly reassessment of the list and that's  how it should operate.

Under Labor, where they had a doubling of the 457 numbers, there was an  enormous list of something like 651 occupations on there where people could come  under the 457 visa programme. So look we've rationalised that, we've cut out over  200, but that will change and its due for review in July and then at the end of the year  as well.

So we'll work through with the universities and we've got a good relationship with  them.

PETER MCGAURAN:

It's good to hear Minister that you're allowing this leeway. And you know for instance  in the breeding and racing industries which I'm involved in, there's a shortage of  Australian willing workers or skills base and the like. But this has opened up this  whole question of to what extent Australians can or will fill a lot of rural based jobs, or  even in the restaurant and catering industries. It's a very big topic. Governments for  decades have wrestled with it and that is the deliberate non-participation in the  workforce by some social security beneficiaries.

PETER DUTTON:

www.minister.border.gov.au



Well this is a two-sided coin I suppose. I mean on the one hand, we need to make  sure that we've got jobs available for Australians that's at the forefront of our policy  announcement to abolish the 457 visa last week. We want to make sure that we can  put Australians into Australian jobs and that should be the default position. If we've  got Australians who don't want to work, then the other side of the coin is that there  needs to be a tightening up in relation to the way in which the sanctions work and  Christian Porter and Alan Tudge in their portfolio of Social Services and Human  Services I think have done an incredible job in dealing with that.

The welfare card - which makes it harder for people to spend money on alcohol or  drugs or whatever it might be and requiring them to spend the money on supporting  their family and providing for their children - all of that is designed to provide a  further incentive for people to go into work. And if people aren't working then they  can expect to have their benefits suspended or they can go to the back of the queue.

This is a difficulty, I mean we've got a country full of people who have worked hard,  who have paid their taxes, who are working part time in retirement, or have recently  retired. Those people deserve to have their taxpayers dollars treated with respect.  And if young people believe that they don't have to work or they don't have to take  that job or an employer's facing the frustration with one of these employees that  won't turn up, then we need to clamp down on that and as a Government we are.  There's a lot of work that we've done and that we'll continue to do to make sure that  those people, if they're of working age and they have a capacity to work, then they  work otherwise they won't be getting the benefit.

PETER BEATTIE:

Peter, the citizenship test changes that you've brought in. There's been some debate  about them. What was the thinking behind that?

PETER DUTTON:

The thinking was to make sure that given all of the people that want to come to our  country, that we have the best people become Australian citizens. And the great  story of migration in this country is that people have come from war-torn Europe or  war-torn Asia at different times and people have created a great opportunity for them  and their families in our country. They've worked hard, they've provided for their  children in terms of a good education etc. and we want that to be the story into the  future as well. And we need to recognise at the same time that the world's a very  different place today than it was even 10, let alone 20 years ago.

I don't think it's too much to ask in saying to people that when you come to our  country, we want you to respect the heritage and the culture and background of your  country of birth, but when you arrive in Australia and you want to become an  Australian citizen then you have to abide by Australian laws. You have to abide by  Australian values and be integrated into Australian society and I think that's - I think  most Australians would support that as an application of common sense.

PETER MCGAURAN:

www.minister.border.gov.au



Agreed Peter and there's been widespread major majority support for the values and  the standards now injected into the citizenship test. For me though the weakness is  that if somebody fails the test or doesn't take the test because of a certainty because  of one conviction or one idiocy over another, doesn't take the test, well there's no  sanction against them. Would you ever consider the test being applied for permanent  residency for instance?

PETER DUTTON:

Well Peter, there are different aspects that you can look at. I think if you're a  permanent resident in this country then equally there should be an onus upon you to  do the right thing and I've cancelled visas of criminals and people committing  offences - outlaw motorcycle gang members and a particular focus on paedophiles  and others. And those numbers are up by 1200 per cent over the course of the last  12 or 18 months.

So there's a lot of work that we're doing to make sure that there's greater integrity in  the system because again Australians have worked hard and we want to support  people in creating a new life in Australia, taking the opportunity here, but we don't  want to be taken advantage of. We don't want to be taken for a ride. The vast  majority of people do the right thing, but those people that don't, don't need to expect  that they can go on to permanent residency or Australian citizenship.

The interesting thing when you look back has been the silence from the Labor Party  over the course of the last few days. Last week Mr Shorten had a number of his  frontbenchers out saying different things and it's really unclear to me still now - even  days later after our announcement - what Bill Shorten stands for in this space. And I  think it's really incumbent upon the Labor Party to come out in a bipartisan way,  support what I think is common sense in what the Government's put forward here  and reign in some of the extremists within his own Party that don't believe in some of  the values that we've talked about last week.

I think for example, if somebody's committing domestic violence, if they're a  perpetrating of domestic violence, if they're abusive of women within the family unit, I  don't think they should become Australian citizens. And equally I think it's important  that people need to be able to speak the English language at least to the level of  competent which we've included as part of this reform. But again, it seems the Labor  Party's divided even on that point.

PETER MCGAURAN:

Yes. Actually Peter I believe all that, just to repeat myself, should be also applied for  permanent residency. Moving to the Budget, which is obviously politically make or  break for the Government in the short term, as it is economically for the country. Do  you agree with the majority of economists who link one of the major factors for  housing affordability - which will be a key plank of your Government's Budget - with  the level of immigration?

PETER DUTTON:

www.minister.border.gov.au



Well Peter, I'll comment on the immigration part. In terms of the Budget, I'll leave that  up to the Treasurer and the Finance Minister and the Prime Minister to comment on  any specific measures or economic policy.

We have a net migration figure in this country of about 190,000 a year. It's come  down quite dramatically since Labor was in power. Under Mr Rudd and Ms Gillard it  was well over 300,000 a year in net terms. What we do know is that the majority of  people do go to Sydney and Melbourne followed thirdly by Brisbane and it does have  an impact in relation to providing those services - the housing, education - given the  numbers that are involved and that, people will argue, could be a good or bad thing. I  think we need to have a sensible debate about where people are going.

Certainly it's the case that from my perspective and others who take part in this  debate, if we can encourage people out to regional areas where there are shortages,  there are job vacancies available. I think it's a great thing to try and provide support  to people to move out to regional areas, but ultimately if people are coming here to  become citizens then they will make decisions about where to live, no different than  others that have been here for generations. They rotate around family or support or  jobs and you can't require or mandate that people live within a particular postcode.  So we need to have a sensible debate about. But of course it has an impact on the  delivery of all of those services when people are rotating to one or two or three  capital cities.

PETER BEATTIE:

Peter we've only got a couple of minutes left, but I'm not going to miss this  opportunity and ask you something about Tony Abbott. I saw your comments on the  weekend about respect being mutual, that he's entitled to respect and former Prime  Ministers are entitled to respect, but we has to obviously respect the current Prime  Minister, or something to that effect. I don't want to verbal you. What does the Party  actually do in relation to Tony Abbott? Because we had the key researcher from  Newspoll on last week and what he basically said was that every time Tony puts his  head up and makes comments about these things it's divisive and the Liberal Party's  vote's effected and it drops. Clearly the current position can't continue, so how does  the Liberal Party actually resolve this with a former Prime Minister and a current  Prime Minister? What do you think the direction should be?

PETER DUTTON:

Well the first rule Peter is to leave the commentary to the commentators and …

PETER BEATTIE:

…that's you Peter…

PETER DUTTON:

…and not comment further. So look, my approach has been that as a - I have this  view and I'm sure it's shared by many, but I'm a member of the Cabinet. If I accept  an invitation from the leader of the day, the Prime Minister of the day, to be a

10

www.minister.border.gov.au



member of the Cabinet then my loyalty is to the leader. And if I don't have confidence  or faith in the leader then I resign from the Cabinet and I don't serve in that ministry. I  think that is an important approach to Westminster Government.

People have their own views. I was loyal to Tony Abbott as a member of his Cabinet.  I accepted Malcolm Turnbull's invitation to be a part of his Government because I  believed I could be loyal to him as leader and I did the same for John Howard when I  served in John Howard's ministry. That's my approach and others can speak for their  own approaches.

As I said on the weekend, we have a great deal of respect rightly for former Prime  Ministers, for former leaders, as the Labor Party does for their former leaders and  Prime Ministers. But it's a two way street. The respect goes both ways, the respect  goes not only toward the former leader, but from the former leader, back to the  current former leader and Party as well. And that's my approach, but again,  commentators will comment on these things and you're best placed to comment on  those sort of internal matters than we are.

I think what's most important - and when you talk about what people believe in - I  mean people stop me on the street all the time saying we want to make sure our  borders are secure. We want to know who's coming into our country. We support you  in kicking out people that have committed crimes against Australians. We support  you on the citizenship measures and the 457 abolition. People want to see their  politicians talking about the matters that are important to them and in my space I  think they're the priorities and I'm just going to continue to do that work and I know  my other colleagues share the same view.

PETER BEATTIE:

Well Peter thanks. You're in a tough portfolio in Immigration. Doesn't matter who has  it, it's one of the most difficult portfolios in any government. So to that extent we wish  you well and thanks for being with us.

PETER DUTTON:

Thanks Peter and thanks Peter very much.

PETER MCGAURAN:

Thanks Pete.
