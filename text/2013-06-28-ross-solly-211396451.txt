ABC 666 ‘POLLIE PANEL’ WITH ROSS SOLLY  Andrew Leigh  Member for Fraser  Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister



FRIDAY 28th JUNE 2013

Topics:                                  Senator Gary Humphries’ valedictory, election date speculation,  carbon pricing, asylum seeker policy

Ross Solly:                           What a big week it has been in federal politics. While all the argy bargy  was going on in the federal Labor Party, Gary Humphries was getting to  his feet for the very last time to make his last ever, well unless, who  knows, but I think it will be, his last ever speech to Parliament. Gary  Humphries, good morning to you.



Gary Humphries:              Good morning, Ross.

Ross Solly:                           How was it this week for you? What was it like?

Gary Humphries:              Oh look, I’m grateful to Kevin Rudd for taking my mind off other things  because obviously this would have been a bit of a sad week in terms of  what I was doing. He held off doing his coup until after I’d finished my  valedictory speech, which I’m grateful. Was a bit strange to see after I  did my speech that there was no one from the Labor Party at all in the  chamber; it was completely abandoned. But it’s been an interesting  week in politics but we can all do without that uncertain, topsy turvy  world so every often. I think I’d be happy to go out at something a little  quieter in the future.



Ross Solly:                           Have you had any tears this week?



Gary Humphries:              No I haven’t. I haven’t. I came close during the speech when I was  talking about my wife and children but no, I haven’t so far.

Ross Solly:                           And have you thought about what you’re going to do post-politics?

Gary Humphries:              Yes, I’ve had a number of quite exciting ideas put on my table and I’ll be  making a decision in the next few weeks about which one I will take.

Ross Solly:                           Does that include building a new garden shed, putting a garage on…

Gary Humphries:              No, no! Well, I will say that I have got a garden project underway right  this moment!

Ross Solly:                           [inaudible] there’s a few ideas that have probably been neglected  because of your time in politics that you can now turn your mind to. But  can you give us any hints on…?



Gary Humphries:              I’ll be doing something in respect to public policy in Canberra in the  private sector. That’ll be the criteria I use to decide what my future will  be and it will be well and truly still in the public space but obviously  quite not what I’m doing at the moment



Ross Solly:                           So we’ll still have cause to talk to you?



Gary Humphries:              Quite possibly, yeah

Andrew Leigh:                  Good



Ross Solly:                           Andrew Leigh is with us well, the Member for Fraser, Andrew good  morning to you.

Andrew Leigh:                  Good morning, Ross.

Ross Solly:                           And you would have missed Gary’s speech then I suppose you would  have been doing other stuff?

Andrew Leigh:                  That was actually my greatest disappointment of Wednesday night. I’d  really wanted to be in the chamber listening to Gary’s speech and then  Gary had generously invited me to a farewell event at the Arboretum  and Wednesday night blew out of control and I wasn’t able to make  that. So Gary, my apologies for not being there for those really  important events.



Gary Humphries:              It was lovely to have Gai Brodtmann and Kate Lundy both in the  chamber listening to the speech, so you were well represented in terms  of the ACT Labor Party.



Andrew Leigh:                  I’m glad to hear it. Though, having said that makes me even more  embarrassed not to have been there.

Ross Solly:                           Everyone knows you were a key numbers man though for the -

Andrew Leigh:                  I’m happy to talk about that but let’s not leave the extraordinary Gary  Humphries -

Ross Solly:                           And I know you want to take, say a few things about Gary but I will just  say that Simon Sheikh has also just sent a tweet in saying,  “congratulations to Gary Humphries. Big contribution to Canberra. It  was a pleasure to be in the public gallery for your valedictory.” So there  you go. Isn’t it nice how people put their political differences to one

side? You wanted to say a couple of words, Andrew, about Gary  Humphries’ career?

Andrew Leigh:                  Simply that Gary has been in public life now since ACT went to self-government in 1989. He’s served as Chief Minister, he’s served as a  Senator for the ACT and he’s been a strong fighter for his party. But he’s  also been a brave one. Crossing the floor against the Howard  Government: you were the first Liberal Senator I think to do that, Gary,  for the rights of the ACT. It’s a tough thing to do personally. So we’ve  had our differences on many political issues. I suspect the coming  minutes will go back to having differences. But to have given so much of  your life to public life is I think extraordinary. Nearly half your life, right?



Gary Humphries:              Mmm, that’s a scary thought, isn’t it?

Ross Solly:                           I suppose it has given you cause to reflect this week, probably more  than the weeks leading up to it now becomes it really does feel like it’s  all over



Gary Humphries:              Yep it has and, you know, as a politician you try and, you want to make  a difference. This is the whole point of -

Ross Solly:                           Do you think you have?



Gary Humphries:              I think so. More so at the Assembly level, to be frank. I mean, when  you’re in a small pond and you’re a big fish, you should make a  difference and, you know, we were in Government quite a bit of the  time we were there and we did a lot of things, I mean, it was surprising  at the beginning of self-government. There were many things about  Canberra that actually hadn’t been looked after by the federal  government that we needed to do. We didn’t have a 24 hour mental  health crisis facility, for example, when self-government started. We  didn’t have a prison. There were many things that I think we needed to  address and those things have been done and I was glad to be part of  the process of making things happen. Snowy Hydro Southcare was, I  think, the thing that I nominated in my speech as being something that I  can look up  and actually see in the sky and see from time to time and  feel, well, that’s a difference that I made. Federally it’s more fine-grained; you don’t get the chance to make a big splash unless you’re a  Prime Minister or a minister. But, you know, enquries into mental  health and to children into institutional care led to a whole crop of new  services in mental health and to the apology to the forgotten  Australians in 2009 and those were big things that made a big difference  and you feel satisfied about those things.



Ross Solly:                           Mmm. Couple of texts. Geoff House says, “I wish Gary well. Long and  dedicated record of service”, and no name attached to this, but “Gary is  a real gentleman and is being very gracious in his political life”, and

Debra has just sent a tweet in saying, “Feeling sad to say goodbye to  Gary Humphries. He has made a significant contribution to the ACT and I  thank him.”

Gary Humphries:              Oh, very nice.

Ross Solly:                           Alright, enough of the niceties.



Gary Humphries:              Let’s move on. Come on, let’s go.

Ross Solly:                           Andrew Leigh, would you personally rather an election sooner or  later?

Andrew Leigh:                  I’m quite relaxed, Ross.

Ross Solly:                           Oh come on! You must have a feeling. Do you want to get it out of the  way? Do you want to get it over and done with? Do you want more time  to get out there and sell the Labor Party with Kevin Rudd as Prime  Minister?



Andrew Leigh:                  The main issue for me is that we have a contest based around ideas and  values, not around nastiness and negativity. So if we need a little bit  more time for the Coalition to put forward an education and a health  policy then that’s probably time well spent. But certainly, I’m very  comfortable going to the election -



Ross Solly:                           You’re ready to go now?



Andrew Leigh:                  We’ve got a positive record of achievement, Ross. We’ve got nearly 600  bills passed through the Parliament. One of the ones just yesterday that  passed the Parliament was the aged care reforms. It’ll double the  number of out-of-home aged care places, produce a new gateway  because aged care is often quite confusing for people looking for aged  care options, and provide better care for dementia patients. So that’s  just one of nearly 600 bills -



Ross Solly:                           What’s your feeling, Andrew Leigh, you must have a feeling, whether  it’s… we know it’s not going to be 14th of September anymore, so what’s  your feeling on a likely date? Do you think it will be sooner, or do you  think -



Andrew Leigh:                  I have no useful intelligence to add on this question, Ross.

Ross Solly:                           He has no useful intelligence, Gary Humphries! What are we getting  him on the show then for if he has no useful intelligence?

Andrew Leigh:                  It’s the least interesting question in politics: ‘when’s the election going  to be held?’



Ross Solly:                           Well I don’t know! There will be a lot of people who think, ‘For God’s  sake, let’s just find out when it is and get it over and sorted out!’

Gary Humphries:              I think that’s the predominant mood in the electorate; they are sick of  this circus that’s been the federal parliament for at least the last six  months but certainly for much of the last three years. They want this to  come to an end. They want to pass judgement. I suppose, I mean, it’s  not as if Kevin Rudd is an entirely new phenomenon; they’ve seen him  before, most people have an opinion about him right now. I imagine  he’ll want to restate Labor policy on key areas. You know, when he was  knocked off by Julia Gillard, she nominated boats, mining tax and  carbon tax as the areas where he’d gone wrong. I think it’s fair to say  in  all three of those areas, as least as much trouble as it was three years  ago, so presumably he has to fix those things and other areas where  government has gone off the rails. But I don’t think there’s much reason  to wait. I think this Government needs to go to the people as soon as  possible.



Ross Solly:                           Just on some of those policies, Andrew Leigh, in one of the papers this  morning Kevin Rudd has apparently told one of your colleagues that he  will not shift to the right on boat people. Do you suspect there will be a  big change in policy within your party on refugees and asylum seekers?



Andrew Leigh:                   Asylum seekers is a difficult area of policy, Ross, and it’s one where our  hope had been through this parliament that by having that Houston  Panel the Coalition would sign on and would give us the authority to  conduct asylum seeker policy, as the Beazley opposition gave to John  Howard. We didn’t get that. We got continued playing of politics by the  Opposition, which I think is disappointing. And we’ve now seen the  Opposition go from supporting an increase in the humanitarian intake  to now wanting to decrease it.



Ross Solly:                           But I was more interested in your policy, though. Do you think there  will be a change in Labor policy now that you have Kevin Rudd back as  Prime Minister?



Andrew Leigh:                  I would expect we’ll pursue the policies we have, which is wanting to be  able to get agreement for the Malaysian arrangement which I think  would make a substantial difference to asylum seeker flows.



Ross Solly:                           So, same old, same old you think then? There won’t be any-

Andrew Leigh:                  Well I do think we need to get authority for that. The Coalition want to  turn boats back to Indonesia, not a signatory country, but they’re not  willing to support our Malaysia agreement; a country which is willing to  do this deal with Australia that I think would deter people from coming.

So we’ll be seeking a mandate from the people to be able to do that  because we think it’s really important to stop those drownings at sea.

Gary Humphries:              Well look, obviously Labor needs a new policy because the present  policy isn’t working. There were three more boats in the last day or so,  another two hundred people have arrived. The policy is in desperate  need of change and if they don’t make that change, there will be more  boats and deaths at sea. They’ve got to find a new policy and Kevin  Rudd needs to state what that will be, and he needs to do it fairly soon  because the problem is probably going to get worse if people smugglers  have the perception that with a change in government there may be a  less attractive market for them and if they’re going to, sort of, push  more people down that pipeline as possible before the election there  could be a very serious problem. So Kevin Rudd needs to tackle this  issue, he needs to have a new policy, I think he has, I mean the  Government has swung to the right in effect by reopening Nauru and  Manus Island and by, you know, trying to push an offshore model of  processing, but they haven’t got it right yet, obviously, and they need to  do that in a very short space of time.



Ross Solly:                           And on carbon tax? It seems like the carbon tax is dead and buried and  Kevin Rudd wants to go to an emissions trading scheme as soon as  possible. Are you ok with that, Andrew Leigh? Do you think that’s wise?



Andrew Leigh:                  Ross, there’s two ways you can put a price on carbon; you can set the  price, or you can set the quantity of emissions. The current scheme has  us moving from a fixed price to a floating price period in the middle of  2015. I’d be relaxed if we were to do that earlier. The CPRS which we  put up in the previous parliament had a slightly shorter fixed price  period. I’m relaxed as to when we move to it. But the big question is not  whether you want a fixed or floating price, the big question is do you  want wacky command-and-control that the Grattan Institute says costs  $100 billion: that’s the Coalition’s direct action plan. Or do you want the  market-based scheme that Barack Obama favours, that around 30  countries in the world are pursuing, that China has now taken on -with  Shenzhen, a ten million person city adopting emissions trading. We have  this irony now where nominally communist China supports market  based emissions based trading, and the nominally free-market Liberal  Party supports command-and-control to deal with climate change. I  think that’s unfortunate. Certainly under Malcolm Turnbull, Brendan  Nelson and John Howard, the Liberal Party was a party of a market-based approach to dealing with climate change. For the simple reason  that it’s just more efficient; you get abatement at a cheaper price than  you do with command-and-control.



Gary Humphries:              Well obviously you’ve got to again new policy. I mean the  Government’s present policy is arguably not working to reduce  greenhouse emissions -



Ross Solly:                           [comment inaudible]



Gary Humphries:              -Well I would argue that if you reduce them in Australia and not in  other places in the world and they’re going up in the rest of the world,  you’ve got a failed policy. That would be my view. But, I mean, the  political reality is that the carbon tax has been a disaster for the  Government. The most recent poll I saw, 67% of Australians wanted the  tax repealed. And whether it’s changed to an emissions trading scheme  or a price that floats or is fixed, it doesn’t really matter. It’s just not  working for the Government and Kevin Rudd will need a new direction.  If he chooses to rename it and to float the price rather than fix it, well  that’s fine. But in three days’ time, the price goes up. It goes up another  $1.14-



[Ross Solly:                         On the same day of the new Cabinet meeting]

Gary Humphries:              -indeed. It goes up again. It’s up to, I think, $38 by 2019 and meant too  keep rising, it’s factored into the Government’s forward planning, in its  Budget incidentally, that it goes up and up. It’s obviously not going to do  that if they’re going to go to a different mechanism, so… But the  problem is that the Government has not got this right and it needs to  make a policy and we’re hoping Kevin Rudd will tell us what that’s going  to be very soon.



Andrew Leigh:                  We’re actually seeing emissions falling; we’ve seen a 7% reduction in  electricity emissions just over the period of the carbon price and that’s  due to a reduction in intensity; so the amount of carbon pollution we  put out per kilowatt of power is lower now than it was last year-



[Gary Humphries:            Every one of those gains has been cancelled out by rises in the rest of  the world]

Andrew Leigh:                  -Gary let’s not go to the old politics of negativity here. Let’s take a bit of  politeness

Ross Solly:                           But there’s negativity and there is also facts though, you’ve got to-

Andrew Leigh:                  Absolutely. So we’ve seen a reduction in electricity emissions, we’ve  seen a smaller impact on prices than had been anticipated; Westpac  says 0.4% rather than 0.7% on CPI and certainly we’re seeing this policy  working. Australia is the 12th largest emitter in the world so it’s  appropriate we use that. When we link to the EU in 2015 chances are  the price will fall.



Ross Solly:                           Quick question for you, Andrew Leigh, any indications at all that you’ll  keep your job as Parliamentary Secretary, have you been told anything  at all?



Andrew Leigh:                  I haven’t been told anything, Ross. It’s a matter for the Prime Minister.  I’ve certainly said that as we spoke yesterday that if he wants me to  step down I’ll do that. He needs to have the team around him that he  feels is best suited to do that job.



Ross Solly:                           I bet you’re looking forward to the weekend, thank you for coming in  Andrew Leigh.

Andrew Leigh:                  Thank you, Ross.

Ross Solly:                           And Gary Humphries thank you, it’s been a lot of fun. I really actually  say this from the bottom of my heart I have enjoyed dealing and talking  with you. We’ve had some feisty chats over time but we’ve had some  great chats as well, and I think above all though, we’ve maintained a  pretty good relationship, well I like to think so anyway.



Gary Humphries:              I agree, I agree

Ross Solly:                           And I hope that can continue. All the best Gary for your post political  life.

Gary Humphries:              Thank you very much, Ross. It’s been a great pleasure.
