VIETNAMESE CHILDREN

The Minister for Social Security, Senator Margaret Guilfoyle,

expressed concern today about recent reports in relation to

Vietnamese refugee children in Australia.

C Senator Guilfoyle said it had been brought to her attention  that a national television network had been attempting to

identify and interview eight children and their foster parents who were the subjects of a recent article in.the .  .

Bulletin. .  .  .  .

The' article alleged that the children in question,  who on .

their arrival in Australia were stated to be orphans,  are

not orphans, but the children of a couple who escaped from

Vietnam, and who are currently in Manila waiting to come to .

Australia.

"While the circumstances described in the article appear to

be substantially correct, as the guardian of immigrant

children under the Immigration (Guardianship of Children)

Act, I am concerned at the probable harmful effects such  publicity would have on these childrenÂ· and their foster  parents", Senator Guilfoyle said. .

"These children have been placed under care of the State .

child _ welfare authorities, who are my delegates under the  above Act."

"The delegates are aware of the situation, and the foster

parents concerned have been informed of the impending arrival of the Vietnamese couple." pri

"Arrangements have been made for the children to see the

couple who claim to be their parents, and my delegates

will give consideration to the re-unification of the children  with them after an examination of all the facts and when and

if their circumstances permit."

The article also mentioned a situation which has arisen in

the United States. This was the possibility of people coming  forward claiming to be the parents' of children from Vietnam.

"My delegates are aware of this situation, and the possibility  of this happening in Australia cannot be discounted", Senator  Guilfoyle said. - .

"Adoption of these children is a legal process which is the .

responsibility of the State and Territory courts, which must

take into consideration all these factors before granting an  adoption."
