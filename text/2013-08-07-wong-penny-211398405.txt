TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW - SUNRISE WITH DAVID KOCH AND  MELISSA DOYLE

E & O E - PROOF ONLY



DOYLE:         We have been asking the Prime Minister Kevin Rudd on the  program every day, but so far he's declined. We're joined by Labor  campaign spokesperson and Finance Minister, Penny Wong. Good  morning to you.



WONG:          Good morning.

DOYLE:         Not implying anything -

WONG:          No (laughs)

DOYLE:         I just wanted everyone to know that -

WONG:          (laughs) - the second choice.

DOYLE:         (laughs) No, I just don't want our viewers to think we’re not being  fair because we had Tony Abbott on Monday and we don’t want that perception.

KOCH:           But why is that? Because Kevin hasn't done virtually any media -  you have done it all the first couple of days. Is that a deliberate tactic though?

WONG:          No, we share it around. And, you know, Kevin is, I am sure, very  happy to be in front of a camera - (laughs)

DOYLE:         (laughs) - you sure about that?

KOCH:           (laughs) I think that is the quote of the day.

WONG:          (laughs) He loves talking to you, Kochie. He loves it.

KOCH:           Yes, of course.

DOYLE:         We'll let them catch up later. Let's talk about interest rates shall  we? Joe Hockey has come out saying that the drop in interest rates  is a negative signal about the economy. And then we’ve had the  Reserve come out and say higher unemployment and slower  growth were among their reasons for the cuts. So, do you think that  the Opposition is right?



WONG:          You’ve got to work pretty hard to say that a reduction in interest  rates - a cut in interest rates - is a bad thing,         only cut the  Liberals don't like - a cut in interest rates, which of course helps  working families, helps families on an average mortgage by about  $6,000 a year. So, it’s a good thing for Australians.



KOCH:           But he is right through - the only reason the Reserve Bank cuts  interest rates is to speed the economy up, give it a bit of stimulus. It  is slowing and retail sales figures look flat and going down...



WONG:          Look, the Reserve Bank made the point that we’ve been making -  we have got global growth that is slower than you would like it, and  that is having an effect on our economy. But let’s remember - I  know Joe wants to talk everything down, but we have grown 14 per  cent since 2007. Compared, as you know, Kochie, to the rest of the  world, especially the advanced economies, that’s not bad. And  nearly a million jobs created, and we’ve seen 28 million lost  worldwide.



So, we’ve got a challenge, we’ve got a transition in our economy.  But an interest rate cut is always a good thing for Australian households.

DOYLE:         Okay, let's put some of the other issues to you: asylum seeker  policy is making headlines again. The advertising blitz on the policy

is reported to be running through August; the Opposition says that's  a big misuse of taxpayer money. What do you say to that?

WONG:          What I’d say is the Opposition have got to decide whether they’re  interested in the national interest here, which is to make sure this  agreement works and the boats stop coming. I mean, we don't want  to see people drowning at sea. We want to manage the  humanitarian intake. Tony Abbott initially supported this and now he  is opposed to it. We think this is in the national interest.



KOCH:           Okay. The other big issue yesterday, probably the biggest  campaign promise going to be delivered today, a 1.5 per cent cut in  company tax - that’s a great thing for business, isn't it? Labor is a  bit on the nose at the moment because of your penalty rate system  and things like that with business - the Coalition getting ahead of  you on this?



WONG:          Remember, this is a company tax cut that can only be funded by  more cuts. More cuts to services, jobs, health, education for  Australian families.  Or, alternatively, an increase in the Goods and  Services Tax - that’s the other way Tony Abbott could fund this. It’s  also a company tax cut to offset a company tax hike. It’s kind of  funny - they are putting up company tax and putting it down as well  to pay for the rolled-gold paid parental leave scheme that Tony  Abbott wants to put in place.

Now, we are supporters of paid parental leave. We’ve had 300,000  Australians already take up Labor's paid parental leave scheme  that has already been delivered. But on this one, you have to  question whether the Coalition would actually deliver it because I  see also in the papers the National Party saying they don't support  it.

DOYLE:         Just a quick one, is anyone going to have a chat to Deputy PM  Anthony Albanese? There’s a photo doing the rounds this morning  of him having a quick drink with former Labor MP Craig Thomson -  obviously a relatively controversial character. During an election  campaign, is this a good look?



WONG:          Well, Albo likes to have a beer. That is not news. (laughs)

DOYLE:         (laughs) Anyone else available?

WONG:          Well, I don't know. He didn’t give me a call, but we probably  weren't in the same town last night.

KOCH:           Kevin loves to be in front of a camera and Albo loves a beer. I  think you summed them up perfectly. Penny, good to see you. Thank you.

WONG:          Good to be with you.

DOYLE:         Thank you very much for coming in.
