RUDDOCK URGES REFORM PROCESS IN SOVIET UNION

In the week of the Federal Budget, there was an unusually high degree of interest  in Foreign Affairs issues. Local Member for Dundas, Philip Ruddock was to the  forefront on the day that the Soviet Union overturned the reactionary coup inspired  by the KGB, Communist Party and Military.

Mr Ruddock moved in the House of Representatives that having been appalled at  the coup, the Parliament congratulate the Soviet people and elected leaders, such as  Mr Boris Yeltsin, for their amazing courage in standing against force of arms to  resist a return to dictatorship.

His resolution urged the Soviet leaders continue the reform process which will give  freedom and democracy to the Soviet people and a market economy, which can  maximise the economic potential of the Soviet Union to the benefit of all its people.

Philip Ruddock also urged that the Soviet leadership give further comfort to the  Baltic republics to become independent sovereign nations, and to return to them  their freedom and independence.

Philip Ruddock, who represents the Shadow Foreign Affairs Minister, Senator  Robert Hill in the House of Representatives, was also active in seeking restoration  of a civilian Government in Burma, condemning the killing of guards on the  Lithuanian border, and deploring the violence and loss of life and destruction of  property that has taken place in Slovenia and Croatia.

Copies of the terms of each of the resolutions are attached,
