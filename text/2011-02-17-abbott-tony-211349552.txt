E&OE……………………….…………………………………………………………………

TONY ABBOTT:

It’s good to be here at St Luke’s hospital. It’s good to be here in Launceston with my friends and colleagues  Richard Colbeck, the Shadow Parliamentary Secretary for Agriculture and Guy Barnett. These are really  hardworking local politicians as well as big contributors in Canberra. I want to spend a lot of time in  Tasmania in coming months, particularly in northern Tasmania, and it’s good to be here today.

I’ve just had some very interesting and constructive discussions with local health professionals about  problems in our health system and the direction of government policy. I think it’s fair to say that no one  understands what these Medicare Locals are supposed to be and there are very grave concerns in the local  health community that these Medicare Locals could turn out to be an attack on fee for service, could turn out  to be an attack on the medical profession, further undermining the professionalism and the autonomy of  doctors and that’s the last thing we should see.

It’s also pretty clear that here in Tasmania the so-called GP super clinics have been a failure. Only one of  them is operational. It’s not giving after hours services. It’s not bulk billing. It’s just a government leg-up to  some doctors over other doctors. What we need in general practice is more doctors. We don’t need more  buildings. The so-called GP super clinics programme is a building programme, it’s not a health services  programme, and that’s why the Coalition has always been opposed to it.

So look, this has been a good visit. I think it’s reinforced for me the importance of trying to ensure that  whenever you talk about health change and health reform you do it in the closest possible consultation with  the local health professionals because they understand the system, they have the interests of patients  absolutely at heart, they know what works and what doesn’t and if reform is ever driven by the bureaucrats  in Canberra, for all their goodwill they tend to get it wrong because it’s got to be practical, it’s got to be  what works.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, what do you make of the Government embracing multiculturalism at the moment?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think that the Coalition has always supported the reality of Australia as a multicultural society, always have  and always will.

QUESTION:

Did Scott Morrison urge the Shadow Cabinet to capitalise on community fears about Muslims?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think that is a travesty of Scott’s position, an absolute travesty of Scott’s position and I just want to stress  that as far as the Coalition is concerned we have always had and we will always have a non discriminatory  immigration policy.

QUESTION:

So he didn’t urge Shadow Cabinet to consider that?

TONY ABBOTT:

I don’t comment on the detail of Shadow Cabinet discussions. I certainly don’t comment the... on old ground  generally. The position you put to me is a travesty of Scott’s position.

QUESTION:

Do you agree about capitalising on the community’s fears about Muslims?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think it’s very important to build a successful and a cohesive society. I think that Australia has been  probably the best example of a successful immigrant society anywhere on earth. We have largely avoided  the problems that have afflicted other countries and that’s the way it’s been and that’s the way it should stay.

QUESTION:

Are you concerned Scott Morrison will be perceived as anti-Muslim?

TONY ABBOTT:

That would be, again, an absolute travesty because there’s no-one who is a more decent and a more  compassionate and a more sensitive person in public life.

QUESTION:

If you don’t agree should Scott Morrison be sacked?

TONY ABBOTT:

The thing is that the position you’ve put to me is a total travesty, a total travesty, and there is no more decent  or sensitive or humane person in public life.

QUESTION:

Do you think there is a problem with [inaudible]

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, I think that from time to time there are always going to be issues but there is no more successful  immigrant society in the world than Australia. Australia is a beacon of decency, of welcome to people from  all around the world. That’s the way it always has been, that’s the way it always should be.

QUESTION:

Scott Morrison’s sentiments, will they be used to try and gain any votes then?

TONY ABBOTT:

The important thing for political parties is to do the right thing by our country and the right thing for  Australia is for us to continue to be an absolute model of a successful immigrant society.

QUESTION:

Do you expect that the Federal Opposition will still pursue the Government over taxpayer funded travel for  the funeral?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think it’s very important that we have a strong border protection policy. I think that the most humane and  compassionate thing you can do is to have a strong border protection policy that doesn’t tempt people to risk  their lives at sea; which doesn’t provide the people smugglers with a product to sell. So, we will continue to  ensure that we are strong for an effective border protection policy and every time another boat arrives that is  a practical demonstration of the fact that this Government’s policies have failed.

QUESTION:

Today Julia Gillard is asking you whether you agree with discriminatory immigration?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think I’ve made our position absolutely crystal clear.

QUESTION:

What about cutting foreign aid funding to the foreign schools and redirecting that into the flood levy. What’s  your stance on that?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, that’s the position that we’ve got. We think that it’s very important that the Government look for  savings. The flood tax is an unnecessary new tax coming from a Government which is addicted to tax and  let’s not forget that the flood tax is just the first new tax that the Government has planned for us this year.  There’s the flood tax, then there’s the mining tax, then there’s the carbon tax and let there be no mistake, the  carbon tax will hit each and every Australian family every time they turn on the lights, every time they open  the refrigerator, every time they get in the car, they will be hit by Julia Gillard’s carbon tax.

QUESTION:

[Inaudible] redirecting of funds to the flood programme?

TONY ABBOTT:

My attitude to the group you’ve just mentioned is long on the record and the important thing for us is to be  an effective critic of the Government, to be a credible alternative and I think we are doing a very good job  on both counts.

QUESTION:

Are you delaying the release of the Liberal election review to avoid it creating problems for the New South  Wales state campaign?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think that by any measure we had a highly successful election campaign. We won a lot seats, we deprived  the Government of its majority, we got 800,000 more votes. Julia Gillard is the first person since 1931 to  lead a first term government into an election where it lost its majority. So, if there’s any one who should be a  little embarrassed about the election performance, it’s the Prime Minister.

Thank you.
