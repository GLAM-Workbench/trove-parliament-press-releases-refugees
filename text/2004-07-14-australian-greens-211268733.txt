Senator Kerry Nettle

Senator for New South Wales



Families shipped to desert at  Vanstone's order  14th Jul 04

Greens Senator Kerry Nettle has condemned the impending removal of asylum seeker

families from Villawood in Sydney for transportation to Baxter Detention Facility in  the South Australian desert.

“The removal of these people from their support networks in Sydney highlights the  continuing callous approach this government has towards asylum seekers,” Senator  Nettle said.

“The Minister must have approved this decision, and should explain to the Australia  public why these people are being removed form their friends and supporters to be  dumped in the desert in South Australia.

“The Minister cannot claim to be compassionate whilst visiting this kind of cruelty on  asylum seekers, including children.

“The Greens are concerned that this transfer of families to South Australia may be in  order to put the women and children into Residential Housing as part of a media  strategy to claim that there are no children in detention.

“Having been to Baxter Detention Facility I know how remote and desolate it is, and  am concerned for the wellbeing of the families being transported their after years of  being in Sydney.”

Greens members will join a protest at the gates of Villawood detention centre at  lunchtime today.
