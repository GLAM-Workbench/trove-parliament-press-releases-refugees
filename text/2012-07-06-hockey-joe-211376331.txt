PRESENTER:

Let's check in with our Big Guns of Politics. This week we're joined by Employment Minister  Bill Shorten who's filling in for Tony Burke. Good morning. Tony is on his way back from the  Whaling Conference in Panama. And Shadow Treasurer Joe Hockey, good morning to you  also. Bill, if I can ask you first, what else can we do? Is there anything other than diplomatic  action that we can take to stop this whaling?

BILL SHORTEN:

The South Korean government raised the idea that they want to go into what they call  scientific whale hunting. The first step is what we said we are going to do which is talk  diplomatically. We can if everything else fails and the talks, take them to the International  Court of Justice but in the meantime I think the first step is putting some pressure back on  South Korea. In Australia, we don't buy the argument that you have to kill a whale to study  it.

PRESENTER:

Aren't we taking them to court already?

PRESENTER:

No, Japan we are taking to court, we have been doing that for years and years as the  Japanese sort of just fob us off. Joe, South Korea says it is using this excuse as well saying  we need to appreciate its cultural diversity and heritage. I didn't realise that South Koreans  ate whale meat. What do you think? Is that fair enough or just a convenient excuse for  them?

JOE HOCKEY:

It is a convenient excuse, it's only a small town in Korea - as I understand it -where the  local villages eat whale meat. When the Japanese and the Koreans say they are using it for  scientific purposes, they say after they have used it for scientific purposes, they eat  whatever of the whale meat is left. So, we all know what it's about. The Norwegians, at  least, are straight forward and say ‘No, we are doing it for commercial purposes for our  people; to feed them’. The bottom line is, you have got to use the gentle art of persuasion  which is diplomacy. We support the government's attempts to try and use that diplomacy to  stop the Koreans from killing whales.

PRESENTER:

Here is fingers crossed that it will work. I want to ask you, this week we have seen the  Opposition claiming that people smugglers are treating our navy basically like the ocean  equivalent of roadside assistance. Another 162 asylum seekers arrived at Christmas Island  yesterday after being rescued by two navy ships. The government says sending distress

signals is a tactic that people smugglers are now using to get everyone to safety. Joe, what  kind of pressure does this put on our border security and our navy resources?

JOE HOCKEY:

Well, Mel, it puts enormous pressure on our naval resources. It is not good enough. It's like  'Groundhog Day' in a sense when we say we have got a 3 point plan to try and put the  pressure on. It is quite obvious that everyone can do more to try and stop the boats but  there is a policy impasse and that's very frustrating.

PRESENTER:

Bill, look, the people smugglers are taking advantage of us. I was stunned that also there  were calls for rescues from relatives of some of the people on the boats, from here in  Australia. So, the message isn't getting through. Not only to the people smugglers but also  their relatives here who are almost encouraging them, which I'm stunned over.

BILL SHORTEN:

This is why off-shore processing is necessary. If people think they come on a boat, pay a  people smuggler, take the risk of drowning but if they can come to Australia and be  processed here, that's the magnet which is helping pull people here. That's why we need to  have an off-shore processing solution, so we say to the Greens, you think it is humanitarian  to just process people onshore, that is not correct. But what we would also say to the  Liberals, is we think Malaysia is the right solution. You think Nauru. We are happy to  compromise. This is a now a time for compromise, it is not a time for party politics.

PRESENTER:

Alright, guys. Thank you for that. Catch you next time. Thank you, Bill. Good to see you.
