Scott Morrison, MP

Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship

Transcript - Sky News PM Agenda  Thursday 27th May 2010

Subject: The Coalition’s policy for restoring sovereignty and control to Australia’s borders.



KIERAN GILBERT:



Can you give a guarantee that the boats would stop under the Coalition’s policy?



SCOTT MORRISON:



Well, we don’t have to give guarantees because we have our record in government. People

know what our policies did last time in government. We know that we went to an average of

just three boats per year when we employed these types of mechanisms before. We now

have an average of three boats, in fact more than three boats, arriving per week.



KIERAN GILBERT:



But you can’t guarantee it, can you? Tony Abbott earlier in the year, in March, said John

Howard stopped the flow. There is no reason to suggest any future government could not do

the same thing. But today there’s no such guarantee?



SCOTT MORRISON:



We won’t rest until this problem is addressed. That’s our commitment. That’s our guarantee

and we’ve got the guarantee of our record in government that showed what our resolve was

and what our results are. This is a government that has no policy on this issue. One hundred

and twenty eight boats have arrived on their watch since they started with the process with

abolishing TPVs in August of 2008 and the armada has flowed since.



KIERAN GILBERT:



Okay. Let me clarify something else then - this was referred to in the parliament as well by

the Prime Minister - did this issue go to the party room or not, did you take this issue, this

policy to the party room and get its approval from the rest of your colleagues?



SCOTT MORRISON:



Well, we have lots of internal processes about how we make decisions and the backbench

and backbench members in particular we consulted and spoke to prior to this announcement

today. There were consultations and discussions I was involved in as far back as February

on these matters and there’s been a long deliberative process. As you know Tony

announced in February the formation of a Border Protection Committee of Shadow Cabinet,

which is chaired by Michael Keenan, and so all of these internal processes have had a pretty

good work out.



KIERAN GILBERT:



But you are critical of the government for having its kitchen table cabinet, for centralising all

its decisions, but this didn’t go to the party room this policy?



SCOTT MORRISON:



I’ve just outlined a backbench committee, a Border Protection Committee of Shadow

Cabinet, Shadow Cabinet talking to backbenchers, I mean it is a well supported policy, it is

Coalition policy and it’s the policy we’ll implement in government.



KIERAN GILBERT:



Well, the simple question is; why didn’t the policy, the finalised policy go to the party room?

Were you concerned that there would be some vocal critics, the likes of Petro Georgiou,

Russell Broadbent, Judith Troeth, Judi Moylan, these moderates who would not be happy

with this policy?



SCOTT MORRISON:



Well I spoke to Petro this morning before the announcement, I spoke to others equally, they

were advised of the announcement….



KIERAN GILBERT:



What did he say to you? What did Petro Georgiou say?



SCOTT MORRISON:



You can ask Petro, I’m not going to go into those conversations. But you know there’s no

surprise….



KIERAN GILBERT:



You can’t use profanities is that what….



SCOTT MORRISON:



No, no that’s not it. Look, we respect and I respect in particular that there are a number of

our members who have opposed these types of measures when we were in government.

They’ve had a consistent view on this matter. I respect that. Our policy is different to what

they would prefer and unlike in the Labor Party we haven’t locked them up in a basement

somewhere, they’re free to say what they want to say. But that’s our policy, that’s what it will

be, the people smugglers know it, the Australian people know it.



KIERAN GILBERT:



But after the temporary protection visas, if we look to some of the specifics in the policy now,

when they were introduced in 1999 and the following year 2000, there was actually a spike

in the number of asylum seekers after the Coalition introduced these the first time around.

So there was actually a spike in the number of people trying….



SCOTT MORRISON:



The actual number of boats declined which people seem to overlook but what is important is

the full suite of measures when they come together. So we had temporary protection visas,

we had the introduction of off shore processing, which ultimately meant the off shore

processing of people in another country. There were a series of measures that all culminated

to get us to a position where we stopped the boats. No one measure in isolation is the silver

bullet to this issue. All of them worked together and that’s what we’ve announced today.



KIERAN GILBERT:



But Scott, you know that temporary protection visas saw a trebling of the number of women

and children seeking or jumping on boats because you don’t have family reunions, you don’t

allow family unions, so you’ve got kids and women making this very desperate bid to get

here?



SCOTT MORRISON:



Well I can tell you how many children there were in detention like facilities, community

detention, alternative detention when we left office - there were 21 - there are almost 400 in

those facilities today.



Now, that’s what happens when you have boats arrive. If [inaudible] there are no women and

children on boats and we will stop the boats and under Labor’s policies, since they abolished

TPVs, so when the TPVs were abolished, we’ve had 128 boats arrive since and we’ve had

women and children on those boats.



KIERAN GILBERT:



But don’t you concede that there is a problem here when you don’t allow any family reunion.

For people who are here for a longer term period, if [inaudible] they come out, men, they do

want to see their wives and kids that they’re going to make that bid on the boat rather than

wait the three years that they might have to wait, probably longer?



SCOTT MORRISON:



Well as we saw last time people started making decisions not to get on boats. What we saw

last time was the people smugglers couldn’t go to potential clients if you like, and say part

with $20,000 or $5,000 US dollars and you’ve got guaranteed permanent residency almost

in Australia. Now, under a Coalition Government a people smuggler cannot say that.



KIERAN GILBERT:



So you’re not worried that the more kids and mothers, wives will be jumping on boats as a

result of your policy?



SCOTT MORRISON:



Well what I know is as a result of Kevin Rudd’s policies we’ve had more children do that in

the last two years then we had in the previous six years of the Coalition Government when

TPVs were operative.



KIERAN GILBERT:



But TPVs, these temporary protection visas, I think the government refers to a figure of 95

per cent, 95 per cent of the people on those temporary protection visas ended up being

classed as permanent refugees anyway, they stayed here?



SCOTT MORRISON:



Well, we’ll assess their cases and their claims when their temporary protection visas expire

but the government themselves have introduced…



KIERAN GILBERT:



Ninety-five per cent, that’s a huge number.



SCOTT MORRISON:



The government has introduced a freeze on asylum applications from Sri Lanka and

Afghanistan. They’ve done that because they say that circumstances change in the home

country. Now, our policy recognises that and it says that you’ll get a temporary protection

visa and over the course of the time you’re here whether it’s six months or up to three years,

if circumstances have changed and you’re able to return to your country, well you will. Now

what this government says, is that we’re going to impose a discriminatory on nationality

policy which freezes people in detention centres for at least six months for Afghans and

three months for Sri Lankans and that’s their solution. Now we’ve said we’ll abolish that. We

will abolish that freeze and I challenge the members of the Labor caucus to raise that. Only

Michael Danby seems to be prepared to stand up to the Prime Minister on this. That is an

abominable policy which acknowledges that these things change, we’ve always known that

things change and that’s why we have TPVs.



KIERAN GILBERT:



They might change but only for a small percentage according to the numbers, 95 per cent of

people who were on the TPVS, the temporary visa, 95 per cent ended up staying here

anyway. So you create this uncertainty, this sense of limbo for no reason, because they are

genuine refugees.



SCOTT MORRISON:



Well, I can’t predict the future, Kieran, and I can’t predict what would happen at the end of

six months or three years but that would be the arrangement and the government agrees

with us. That’s why they’ve put a six month freeze on Afghan applications and a three

months freeze on Sri Lankans. Their Cabinet has got to meet to decide whether they’re

going to extend those or not. We’re saying that’s an unnecessary and frankly inhumane way

to handle what is the realities of this situation. Assess their claim as of now and if they need

to have a TPV of six months, well give them a TPV of six months.



KIERAN GILBERT:



What about this 45 day rule that it asylum seekers don’t make a bid for asylum within 45

days that they miss out?



SCOTT MORRISON:



No, they don’t miss out. What they…



KIERAN GILBERT:



They can claim refugee status beyond that?



SCOTT MORRISON:



You can claim refugee status at any time while you’re in Australia so if someone is here on a

valid visa, they’re a student for example and they’re studying, they can claim asylum at any

time during that period. Now what we’re saying is you are required to make an application for

asylum within 45 days of arriving if at some point you do it after that and you are no longer

on a valid visa or you’re an overstayer. Then, you can make your claim but you won’t have

any access to any of the ongoing income support or any other forms of support to sustain

you while you go through potentially years and years and years of appeals. So, what we

have is a situation…



KIREAN GILBERT:



But, what happens if, can I just ask you a question on that issue?



SCOTT MORRISON:



Yeah, sure.



KIERAN GILBERT:



What happens if a genuine refugee arrives here, struggles with English, has had a

traumatised time getting here. They’ve got kids and so on and then you’ve got to say, well,

you’ve got to get your act together within a month and a half otherwise bad luck, we won’t

give you any support.



SCOTT MORRISON:



No, if they’re here on a valid visa. They might be here for two or three years. They can make

their…



KIREAN GILBERT:



What happens if they’re not? What happens if they’re refugees?



SCOTT MORRISON:



If they’ve arrived illegally, well then they’re subject to our TPV policy, they make their claim.

If their claim is rejected, well they’re going home. If they’re onshore, they’re able to pursue it

in the courts and what we’re saying is if you get rejected as an asylum seeker in Australia

and you’ve had your determination and it’s over and we would like you to go home we’re

saying if you haven’t made your claim within 45 days, well, you won’t get any ongoing

[inaudible] in terms of income or other things while you potentially pursue your appeals

endlessly.



KIERAN GILBERT:



But, aren’t you expecting people sometime, as I say, after traumatised periods struggling to

find their way when they get here. You want them to have this organised within a month and

a half of being here.



SCOTT MORRISON:



No, no, if they’re on a valid visa, which could be years, they will continue to get whatever

support they’re entitled to while that visa is in place. What this does is for those who get to

the end of say their student visa and there’ll be a number of those coming up as the

Government knows in the next sort of 12 to 18 months. If they get to the end of their visa and

they don’t want to go home and decide to claim asylum to lengthen their stay…



KIREAN GILBERT:



They’ve got to do it within 45 days.



SCOTT MORRISON:



No, they can still make their claim, but if they’re unsuccessful with their claim we are not

going to continue to provide them income support and so on while they’re pursuing an

appeal against their rejection.



KIERAN GILBERT:



Ok.



SCOTT MORRISON:



Those who are, those who make their claim and get a yes, well, they’re in Australia under a,

on a visa.



KIREAN GILBERT:



What about the countries that you’re going to negotiate with, the Opposition Leader wouldn’t

state specific countries, but it’s pretty obvious though, isn’t it?



SCOTT MORRISON:



No.



KIERAN GILBERT:



I mean, where else are you going to send them? It’s got to be a Pacific Solution doesn’t it?



SCOTT MORRISON:



Well, as I said…



KIREAN GILBERT:



You’re not going to send them to the Atlantic or to the Indian Ocean, surely?



SCOTT MORRISON:



Well, we could get out an atlas and you could run through all the countries if you like, Kieran,

but we’re not going to speculate on it. This is too important a policy to jeopardise by flagging

potential countries in Opposition. We’re not in government. You do these negotiations in

government. Alexander…



KIERAN GILBERT:



It’s got to happen with the neighbours. I mean, if you’re going to have offshore processing,

you’re not going to send them to Stockholm or to, you know, Oslo to process these people

are you?



SCOTT MORRISON:



Others can speculate. We won’t jeopardise this policy by that speculation in Opposition.

Alexander Downer, Foreign Minister for eleven-and-a-half years, has supported us in this

view and has issued a statement saying that he’s quite confident that a location could be

secured on agreeable terms and that’s based on many years experience with the region.



KIERAN GILBERT:



But it’s got to be Nauru, PNG, something like that, doesn’t it? I mean, just the logistics don’t

seem to make sense beyond that.



SCOTT MORRISON:



Well, as I say, others will speculate, Kieran. We won’t.



KIERAN GILBERT:



Ok. Why would Indonesia accept the boats being turned back? If they’ve got tens of

thousands of internally displaced people themselves, why would… you say you want to turn

the boats back but Indonesia’s going to say, well, I’m sorry, we’ve got tens of thousands of

our own internal refugees that we’ve got to deal with.



SCOTT MORRISON:



Well, Kevin Rudd said he’d turn the boats back and Kevin Rudd never even tried to turn the

boats back. We don’t pretend that this is an easy thing to do and in the policy released today

we set out the circumstances that would need to be satisfied and that includes Indonesia

being willing, if that is indeed where you were trying to return the boat to…



KIERAN GILBERT:



That’s unlikely, isn’t it?



SCOTT MORRISON:



Well, it’s certainly unlikely under Kevin Rudd’s Government because I don’t think the

Indonesians would ever accept that this Government is deadly serious about this issue, and

the sorts of policies that we’ve announced and that we’ve worked in government before… I

mean, we returned four boats when we were in government, with the support of the

Indonesian Government. We didn’t go out and do press conferences on it and big note

ourselves about phone calls to the Indonesia President, we just got on with the job. Now, we

need to rebuild that trust with the Indonesian Government and we think these policies are a

good way of doing that.



KIERAN GILBERT:



Ok, there are major issues at the moment… you’re a former Housing spokesman. Cost of

living, affordability, interest rates and so on. Why is the Coalition focusing on this specific

issue? Is it because you know it’s politically potent?



SCOTT MORRISON:



Well, I’m the Shadow Minister for Immigration so you’d expect me to be focusing on

Immigration, Kieran…



KIERAN GILBERT:



Obviously, but today the Opposition Leader…



SCOTT MORRISON:



Not Housing, I used to focus on Housing.



KIERAN GILBERT:



But, you know, at the end of Parliament this week, it’s Newspoll next week. Tony Abbott gets

up today with this big border security policy. Why not focus on some of the other issues

around today?



SCOTT MORRISON:



Look, we asked one question of this today in Question Time and asked a series of questions

on a whole range of other issues.



KIERAN GILBERT:



So, it’s not about the politics of this?



SCOTT MORRISON:



We have always had a strong view in this issue, I don’t think anyone could discount that.

We’re not newcomers to this debate or newcomers to these ideas or these policies. We

wouldn’t be having this conversation if 120 boats hadn’t turned up since they abolished

TPVs and almost 6,000 people have arrive. If Labor’s policies had worked there’s be no

debate. They’ve failed, we’re going to restore what Labor abolished.



KIERAN GILBERT:



Scott Morrison, as always appreciate your time. Thank you.



SCOTT MORRISON:



Thanks, Kieran.
