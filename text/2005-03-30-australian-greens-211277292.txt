Vanstone must explain her Department's  use of false documents

30th March 2005

Greens Senator Kerry Nettle called on Senator Vanstone to explain  whether her department used false documents to deport a man to  Cameroon.  "The Australian public need to know if the Department of Immigration  is using false documents to deport people.  "We need to know what the department did with the information  supplied by the French Embassy about the man's fake identity. When  was the department informed? Was the man's identity investigated?  Why did the department deport a man on a passport they knew carried

a false name?  "The Minister must explain what procedures are followed by her  department when there is doubt about the authenticity of travel and  identity documents. Were these procedures followed in the case of 'Mr  Kingue'?  "The Edmund Rice Centre report Deporting to Danger (September  2004) contained multiple allegations that the Department of  Immigration allowed asylum seekers to be deported on false  documents and knowingly removed people to countries where their  status would not be legal.  "The Minister must explain whether the use of false documents during  deportations is part of the Department of Immigration's standard  operating procedure," concluded Senator Nettle.
