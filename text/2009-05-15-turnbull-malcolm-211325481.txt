Fri, 15th May 2009   TURNBULL INTERVIEW WITH MARIUS BENSON (ABC NEWS RADIO) -  COALITION’S PLAN FOR RECOVERY

The Hon Malcolm Turnbull MP   Leader of the Opposition

E&OE

MARIUS BENSON:

Malcolm Turnbull, you were hitting the debt theme hard last night, saying what the  Government has wrong in that regard but you won’t say what the correct level of  debt is.

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Marius, we have a plan for recovery. The Labor Party has a plan for debt and deficit.  We have a plan that will generate a stronger economy, that will support small  business, that will support jobs. It is that engine of growth which over time will enable  Australia to pay off this debt because as we have a stronger economy, as we grow  the pie there is of course more government revenue.

MARIUS BENSON:

But the pie that you would grow is rapidly shrinking at the moment with the global  financial crisis. Joe Hockey said that were you in office you would not be running a  deficit like Labor’s $58 billion. You’d do $25 billion better than that. Do you agree  with Joe Hockey?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

All Joe is pointing to is the fact that we have already opposed some of Labor’s  reckless spending.

MARIUS BENSON:

Okay. The key specific point that you proposed in your Budget Reply speech was the  opposition to the means testing of the health insurance rebate proposed by the  Government. You’ll vote against that in the Senate. Are you determined to maintain  that vote even if it means providing a trigger for an early election?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Kevin Rudd wants to cut and run to an early election before the Australian people  find out or fully recognise the consequences of his economic mismanagement. This  is a Prime Minister who is terrified of facing the full consequences of his  mismanagement. Within 18 months, this Prime Minister has taken us from being a  country which had no government debt, had $45 billion in cash at the bank to one  where we are headed towards $200, perhaps $300 billion of debt. And you know, he  talks about debt peaking at $188 billion but then has in his Budget a whole range of  vast projects which aren’t even taken into account…

MARIUS BENSON:

Okay.

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

…whether broadband or Rudd Bank or other measures.

MARIUS BENSON:

What about the Opposition though. Are you ready for an early election because you  don’t have key policies in place on issues like climate change and asylum seekers.  You don’t have preselections sorted out and according to all reports, you don’t have  the money for a campaign.

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Well Marius, we will fight… we will fight an election whenever it’s called. As far as the  timing of it, that is largely in the Prime Minister’s hands. If he can persuade the  Governor General to issue the writs, he can have an election.

MARIUS BENSON:

We see Senate tensions. Will you be fast tracking preparations?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

A political party should always be ready for an election. Always ready for an election.

MARIUS BENSON:

Okay. You said the Government has ducked the tough financial decisions but the  only revenue-gathering proposal you announced yesterday was an increase in tax  on cigarettes. Now that is one of the softest options. Smokers are pretty friendless in  the public sphere.

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Marius, really, you surprise me. Look, let’s be quite clear about this. Kevin Rudd is  the one that is running this Budget. It is his Budget. It’s his deficit. It’s his debt. He’s  created it. Whenever he’s asked a tough question, he throws up his hands and he  says, oh, ask Mr Turnbull, ask Joe Hockey, ask the Liberals. Ask them what they’ll  do. He’s the one that’s got to answer those questions. Now we have said, I’ve said,  that the deficit is already too big. I don’t want to make it any bigger. So we have very  responsibly identified a budget measure. This assault on the public hospital system,  on private health insurance is an incredible betrayal of an election promise. There  was never an election promise given more emphatically than that by Kevin Rudd  when he said there would be no change to the private health insurance rebate. He  could not have given a more emphatic and more repeated election promise…

MARIUS BENSON:

Okay but just on the smokers issue, just on the smokers issue, I suggested smokers  were friendless. They’re not quite. Bronwyn Bishop has expressed open dissent at  your proposal for a higher tax on cigarettes.

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Yes, so. Yeah I know. Well, Julia Irwin in the Labor Party has expressed  disagreement with the Government’s Budget.

MARIUS BENSON:

But that’s twice in two weeks Bronwyn Bishop has had a shot at you or your policies.

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Well, as I said, the Labor Party has Julia Irwin. She was out there the night of the  Budget attacking the Labor Party’s Budget so this is politics.

MARIUS BENSON:

So you’ve got no problem with public dissent?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Politics is a team business and it’s very important that the team works together but in  every team there are people who express views that are contrary to what the team is  pursuing.

MARIUS BENSON:

Okay. The person in your team who probably has, obviously has most experience on  economic issues is Peter Costello. Did he play a part in preparing the Budget in  Reply speech?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Peter was very pleased with the speech. He made a point of congratulating me on it  afterwards and we certainly, I certainly talk to Peter from time to time about  economic matters and I know Joe Hockey does too. He has a lot of experience.

MARIUS BENSON:

Hoping Peter Costello will renominate next month?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

That’s entirely a matter for him.

MARIUS BENSON:

Malcolm Turnbull, thank you very much.

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Thanks Marius.
