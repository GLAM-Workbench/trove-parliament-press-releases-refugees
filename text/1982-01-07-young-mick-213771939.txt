PRESS RELEASE FROM MR MICK YOUNG, SHADOW MINISTER FOR

IMMIGRATION AND ETHNIC AFFAIRS. .

THE CASE OF 'PETE SMITH'

"The South African Government does not abide by any

international code of civil liberties and remains today one

of the most brutal regimes in the world" said Mr Mick Young,

Shadow Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs.

Mr Young was commenting on the case of Mr 'Pete Smith', a

South African draft dodger who has applied for refugee status

in Australia.

"There is a lot of evidence of persecution of people who

return to South Africa for what they have done or said outside

their country", Mr Young said.

"There can be no doubt about the likely treatment this young

man would be likely to receive if he is forced to return to

South Africa".

"The DORS committee should take all these matters into

consideration when they consider the application of Mr

'Pete Smith'", Mr Young said.
