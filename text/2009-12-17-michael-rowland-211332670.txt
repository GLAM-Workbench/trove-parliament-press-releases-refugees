ABBOTT INTERVIEW WITH VIRGINIA TRIOLI AND MICHAEL ROWLAND (ABC  NEWS BREAKFAST) - KEVIN RUDD’S GREAT BIG TAX ON EVERYTHING,  COPENHAGEN...

The Hon Tony Abbott MP

Leader of the Opposition

Subjects: Kevin Rudd’s great big tax on everything; Copenhagen; Oceanic Viking

E&OE

VIRGINIA TRIOLI:

Tony Abbott, good morning. Thanks for joining us.

TONY ABBOTT:

Nice to be here, Virginia.

VIRGINIA TRIOLI:

Now your predecessor John Howard fought and he won an election on a dirty big new tax and that was the GST,

so what makes you think that such a popular Prime Minister like Kevin Howard might not be able to see you and

match you and raise you on that?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well the interesting thing about the GST is that we had gone through a very lengthy national debate it on, starting

back in the Fraser era, we then had Paul Keating's Option C, we had John Hewson's Fightback! election and

then finally we had the 1998 election. So the GST has been subject to a debate. It had been examined up hill and

down dale by the Australian people, similar tax systems had been in place in other countries in the world -

comparable countries - so the time was right for the GST.

But don't let's also forget, Virginia, that back in 1993 Paul Keating won an election saying that if you don't

understand it don't vote for it, and if you do understand it you would never vote for it, and he said that about the

GST.

VIRGINIA TRIOLI:

So that is going to be your mantra in this particular campaign?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well look, I think there were strong arguments for a GST. I think that if you want to improve the environment let's

take direct action to improve the environment, let's not raise the cost of living, let's not put in a tax masquerading

as an environment policy.

MICHAEL ROWLAND:

But surely any policy you'll come up won't be free by any stretch of the imagination. How much less expensive

will it be than the one the Government is proposing?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well the policy that I will come up with, Michael, it will be strong, it will be effective and it will be out there before

Parliament goes back in February. I'm not saying that we can make massive environmental changes in a cost-free way. What I am saying is it's better to invest the money directly rather than engage in this $120 billion

money-go-round that's going to add $1,100 a year to the average family's costs.

VIRGINIA TRIOLI:

It is possible that Copenhagen could end in a kind of a deadlock or maybe an agreement to meet later and talk

again. Would you see that as a good outcome?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, I think agreements to have an agreement in the future aren't really agreements, their Clayton's

agreements. Meetings to decide to have another meeting aren't very productive meetings. Now, I know that the

Prime Minister’s stock in trade is to conduct studies to have more studies, so it would be in a sense part of the

Rudd way ….

VIRGINIA TRIOLI:

But hang on he’s not orchestrating all of that. That is a whole lot of…..

TONY ABBOTT:

Well he did tell us that he was one of the great maestros of Copenhagen. I mean he's a friend of the chair and all

that. He's been phone stalking world leaders for months on all of this stuff. But look, let's hope we get a good

outcome. But it does look pretty chaotic at the moment, and for Australia to make binding commitments that will

have a big impact on our economy without similarly binding commits from other countries would be a big mistake

VIRGINIA TRIOLI:

So what would a good outcome be in your view?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well a good outcome would be a commitment by all the big emitters to make significant cuts, an enforceable

commitment to make significant cuts, not weasel words like ‘reducing the intensity of emissions’ but commitments

to make cuts.

MICHAEL ROWLAND:

Bringing the conversation back to domestic politics, there appears to be still a lot of bad blood this morning from

that rather bitter leadership battle 15 days ago. Mark Westfield, the former senior media adviser to Malcolm

Turnbull, has written a fairly scathing article in the Business Spectator describing the Liberal Party as a divided

rabble, predicting a very heavy defeat on any election fought on the ETS, and accusing Andrew Robb, who of

course stood up in the party room and attacked Malcolm Turnbull's policy, of calculated treachery. Surely this is

going to be a tremendous distraction for you as you try to reunite the Liberal Party and take the fight up to Kevin

Rudd?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think there’s already a sense of yesterday’s news about all that stuff, Michael. I mean I can understand people

feeling unhappy and a bit cheated by a party room spill. It's always difficult something like that. But I think we

have all moved on and I can understand Mark being unhappy, but I think that it's yesterday's news.

VIRGINIA TRIOLI:

He’s not moved on in a complete sense because he actually points to the future and says in his view that

Malcolm Turnbull could recontest his seat successfully and be in a position to re-lead your party, to take the

leadership from you?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well look, it's quite possible, who knows what the future holds? But I am leading the party. The policy of the party

is now clear. We are opposed to an emissions trading scheme. We are opposed to a great big new tax

masquerading as an environment policy. I'll lead to party to the election and let see how it goes. I think we can

win.

VIRGINIA TRIOLI:

When you say it is quite possible that it might happen though, it almost sounds as if you feel that your hold on the

leadership is a little tenuous. Is that a correct interpretation?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think between now and the next election my hold is as secure as these things ever can be.

VIRGINIA TRIOLI:

Yeah and I guess the leadership of your party has proven that to be the case, hasn’t it?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look Virginia, I mean let’s not pretend that nothing ever changes in this world. You media people understand just

how fickle things are. But look, I am very confident that there is a whole new mood in the parliamentary party. I

think that the Liberal Party in the country has been galvanised and is enthused in a way that we certainly haven't

been at any time since the last election. So I think we're looking forward now. I think we've put the unhappiness

of a fortnight ago behind us.

VIRGINIA TRIOLI:

Well looking forward, do you think that John Alexander can take Bennelong from Maxine McKew?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think he is a very capable bloke. I think he's the kind of candidate that the public will give a good look at, I think

they'll give him a fair go. You know, I think that Maxine McKew - I hate to say this of a former ABC Television

personality…

VIRGINIA TRIOLI:

Go for it….

TONY ABBOTT:

….but I think if I can say so, Virginia, she has been a bit of a disappointment in the parliament. I think there were

big expectations of her. I don't know that she's really made much of a mark and certainly I think she's been a

pretty ordinary local member.

MICHAEL ROWLAND:

But can John Alexander win the seat off her?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think he certainly can. He certainly can.

VIRGINIA TRIOLI:

Other domestic items around this morning, interesting reports that those 78 Tamils who were rescued from the

Oceanic Viking, there could be a resettlement agreement that involves a number of countries including the US.

Do you like the prospect of that? It sounds in fact similar to something that John Howard managed to engineer

with another little country to our north?

TONY ABBOT:

Yes, but let’s not forget, I mean basically those Tamils got what they wanted. I mean they effectively blackmailed

the Australian Government into giving them what they wanted.

VIRGINIA TRIOLI:

No, what they wanted was to be settled in Australia.

TONY ABBOTT:

What they wanted was a new life in a first world country and that's what they're going to get

VIRGINIA TRIOLI:

But that’s what most asylum seekers want when they put themselves to leaky boats Tony Abbott.

TONY ABBOTT:

And the whole problem, Virginia, is if the people who take these terrible risks ultimately get what they want, more

people will take those risks, more people will keep coming, that's why we now have this steady flow, almost every

day another boat, because they think if they can get here ultimately they can stay here - and that's the wrong

signal that Kevin Rudd has sent.

MICHAEL ROWLAND:

As we head into the election year, there appears to be a cost line in the Government's attack on you. Every time

a minister or the Prime Minister gets up the words reckless and erratic come out when they talk about you. What

is your interpretation of that? Is that a suggestion they potentially see you as more of a threat then they're

actually letting on?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think Kevin Rudd has looked a bit rattled for the first time in his prime ministership. He even rushed on to do a

radio interview on AM the other morning after I'd made some comments. I think the Government is bit anxious. I

think they know they are vulnerable. I think their own heartland is very unhappy about the emissions trading

scheme. I think their own heartland is bombarding Labor members just as we Liberals were bombarded about Mr

Rudd's great big new tax. So look, I think it's going to be an interesting year in politics.

VIRGINIA TRIOLI:

We have very little time left but I do just want to quickly show you that in The Australian you've been depicted in

the last couple of days as ‘Churchillian’ - let me just quickly get that up there, that's how you were described

yesterday - and today you're ‘Spartacus’, you're the leader of the revolution of the people. There you are,

‘Spartacus Abbott,’ do you like that description?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well except that Spartacus came to a sticky end.

VIRGINIA TRIOLI:

It all ended very badly.

TONY ABBOTT:

Yeah but look, Kevin Rudd knows he has a fight on his hands - and that’s a good thing.

VIRGINIA TRIOLI:

So the revolutionary leader this time around is you?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, in a good cause let’s lead a people’s revolt.

VIRGINIA TRIOLI:

Alright we’ll see what you manage. Tony Abbott good to see you again. Thanks so much.

TONY ABBOTT:

Thanks Virginia. Thanks a lot.
