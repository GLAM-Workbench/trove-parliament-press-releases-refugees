REVIEW OF MIGRATION DECISIONS REPORT TABLED

The Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic  Affairs, Mr Gerry Hand, today tabled the report of the  Committee for the Review of the System for Review of  Migration Decisions in the House of Representatives.

The Committee, chaired by former Minister for Immigration, Mr Ian McPhee, was appointed in February to examine the  scope, structure and operation of the current system for  review of migration decisions.

The Committee found that there is substantial community  support for the current system of review of migration  decisions, particularly the operation of the Immigration  Review Tribunal (IRT).

"The Committee passed a number of useful recommendations for  strengthening the statutory basis and management process of  the review system at the Migration Internal Review Office  (MIRO) and IRT tiers.

"It also recommended that the range of decisions and the  people who might seek review of decisions be extended  substantially.

"These recommendations were consistent with changes to the  review system contained in the Migration Reform Bill 1992  which was recently passed by Parliament.

"The report will be of considerable use in improving both  the existing system for review and in setting up the Refugee  Review Tribunal which is to be established under the  Migration Reform Bill 1992," Mr Hand said.
