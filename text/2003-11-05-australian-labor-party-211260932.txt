Just What Coast is Coastwatch Watching?



Late night backroom meetings to excise Australian islands are not a valid response  to the second failure this year by Coastwatch to interdict an Indonesian fishing  vessel carrying asylum seekers into Australian territory. When our maritime borders  are breached, the Liberal Government calls the lawyers, Labor would call the  Coastguard.

Given the fact that since the 2001 election 100% of the boats carrying asylum  seekers into Australian territory have done so without being interdicted by  Coastwatch, the Labor Party is left asking, just what coast is Coastwatch watching?

The Liberal Government has contracted out responsibility for guarding our coastline  to a motley crew of private companies, government agencies, and the Navy. By  commissioning a Coastguard, a Labor Government would take responsibility for the  protection of Australia’s porous maritime borders.

The Howard Government had time to call the cartographers, but didn’t have time to  ensure Coastwatch stopped and searched this boat. The Labor Party believes that  border protection means protecting borders, not redrawing them.

We also believe that Guards guard borders - lawyers don’t.

Until the Liberal Government learn this lesson, the protection of Australia maritime  borders will be in the hands of government lawyers, rather than a specially trained,  specially equipped, Australian Coastguard.
