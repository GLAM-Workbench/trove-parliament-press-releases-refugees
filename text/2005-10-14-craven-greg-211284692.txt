The New Centralism and the Collapse

of the Conservative ConstitutionÃ¢ÂÂ

Introduction  Moving rather indirectly towards my topic, it may be observed that some of the  greatest epics in history have concerned the collapse of love affairs. We all remember  the intense drama in the falling-out of Othello and Desdemona, Hamlet and Ophelia,  Bob Hawke and Paul Keating.

There are relatively few epics in the field of Australian constitutionalism, and those  that have occurred never have made it into Shakespeare. Yet it did strike me in  preparing this lecture that when one does encounter an antipodean constitutional epic,  it may well concern a shattered love. The reason I say this is that we are now  witnessing in Australia the bitter falling-out between two of the great partners of our  constitutional history - conservative liberalism on the one hand, and federal  constitutionalism on the other. As we all are aware, the Howard government is in the  process of leaving home to live in sin with that dreadful old tart, Canberran  centralism, leaving a weeping federalism behind, and six wailing brats of states.  Unappealing children, one admits, but desperately hungry.

What I would like to do in this lecture is three things. First, I will attempt to trace the  historic connection between Australian conservatism and Australian federalism.  Second, I will consider the current attacks on Australian federalism, and the logical

responses that may be made in its defence. Finally, I will examine in some detail the  emerging rift between federalism and its traditional conservative supporters. The basic  thesis of the lecture will be that, in turning their collective back upon federalism,  Australia’s liberals and conservatives are spurning a fundamental element of their  own political philosophy and tradition.

Federalism and conservatism  It is important to begin with the reality that our Constitution, for all its virtues and  vices, is very much a liberal-conservative artefact. The Constitution, as a matter of  simple fact, was the favoured creation of Australian conservatives. This can be seen,  firstly, in its classically liberal-conservative institutions: its bicameral parliament, its  responsible government, even its contemporarily uncongenial constitutional  monarchy. It can be seen, fundamentally, in the institution of federalism, a matter to

which I will return at length. None of this can come as any surprise: our Constitution  is, after all, a masterful fusion of the two great nineteenth century liberal-conservative  constitutional traditions, those of the United Kingdom and the United States of  America.

We also can discern the conservative lineage of the Constitution in the hands and  faces of the people who wrote it. Our great Founders overwhelmingly were  conservatives and liberals: Barton, Griffith, Deakin, Kingston, and Reid never  attended a meeting of the Rooty Hill branch of the Australian Labor Party. Even the  occasional radical delegate to the Conventions, such as Isaacs and Higgins, were  hyper-liberals, not proto-socialists. Labor, for a variety of reasons centring on a  disinclination to risk its strengthening position within the existing colonial structures,  and a general suspicion of federalism as a form of government, effectively dealt itself  out of the creation of the Constitution during the 1890s. The result is that the  Australian Constitution is, in fact, the greatest public work of Australian  conservatives. It hardly is surprising, therefore, that it historically has been defended  by conservatives, and more or less consistently attacked by their opponents from the  Labor side of politics.

Notwithstanding its self-evident conservative lineage, however, the most obvious  feature of the Australian Constitution is its federalism. Indeed, the single word that  most accurately describes our Constitution is that it is a “federal” constitution: the  document breathes federalism. Indeed, if one compares federalism as a constitutional  component with other significant conservative features of the Constitution - such as  the monarchy - the comparison is between the iceberg and the penguin. Even the most  hardened centralist is forced to concede that virtually every significant part of the  Constitution is premised on federalism. From the composition of the Commonwealth  Parliament, to the judicature chapter, through the powers of the national legislature to  the existence of the States themselves, at the heart of Australia’s governmental  dispositions is a fundamental commitment to federalism.

This reality even is susceptible of proof by physical experiment. If one takes a Stanley  knife to a copy of the Constitution and cuts out every reference to federalism and the  States, one is left not with a Constitution, but confetti. The Constitution of Barton and  Deakin cannot exist without federalism, and this has specific logical consequences for  Australian constitutional conservatism. Thus, it is not possible for an Australian  conservative to claim to be a staunch defender of the Constitution - for example, in  the context of the republican debate - but to repudiate federalism. It would be as silly  as a purported conservative Catholic denying the resurrection, or a claimed Geelong  supporter rejecting Gary Ablett. The conservative lineage of the Constitution is  inseparable from its federal essence, and as we will see, this is entirely unsurprising.  Those liberal conservative founders chose federalism as a form of government, not  only as a politically convenient means of bringing the colonies together in the 1890s  (which it was), but fundamentally because it reflected central aspects  of their own  political conservative philosophy.

I accept, of course, that the Constitution does not enjoy a current popular reputation  that matches its historical credentials. Indeed, it is (quite wrongly) held in relatively  low esteem. It is perceived widely as a “British” document, and as such about as  appealing as burnt kippers. We tend to think of it as having been cobbled together by

2

intransigent colonial statesmen, too selfish to opt for a proper and full union, which  would have abolished regrettable tendencies like Tasmania. We are sure that it is full  of obscure language like “heretofore” and “thereinafter”, and that it is utterly  irrelevant to everyday life. Many of these criticisms are plain silly. I note, for  example, that the Constitution is not in full of syntactical Victoriana and bad legal  Latin. Indeed, any of you who have the slightest familiarity with modern legislation  and who also have read the Constitution readily will testify that it is far more  comprehensible than most contemporary enactments Yet the contrast between the low  popular esteem of the Australian Constitution, and that of the United States, whose  citizens seem to be able to recite it on or in defiance of demand, is striking.

There are various reasons for this, which I will not go into in detail. One is that our  Constitution has committed the unforgivable sin of having an uninteresting history -no blood, no wars, no massacres, no guillotines or Czars - the sort of things that excite  fourteen year-old boys and television producers. The other is that after one hundred  years, we tend to see Federalism as having been inevitable, and therefore are  profoundly unmoved by it. The reality is that when Deakin said that Federation was a  miracle, he was speaking nothing more than the truth.

Yet against this lacklustre perception of our Constitution, we need to set a central,  paradoxical reality: that both the Constitution and the federalism it so prominently  enshrines have very genuine claims, if not to reverence, then to public respect. Central  here is the character of the Australian Constitution, in the most modern sense, as a  “Peoples’ Constitution”. This arises in three fundamental respects. First, the  Constitution overwhelmingly was drafted by delegates elected by the peoples of the  colonies for that purpose, and thus comprises a popular constitution in terms of  formulation. Second, the Constitution was endorsed by democratically conducted  referenda among the colonial populations, conferring upon it a popular legitimacy of  adoption. Finally, the Constitution remains amendable only through referenda  conducted under section 128, a truly popular method of alteration. No matter how  down-at-heel our Constitution may be in how many respects, there is no other modern  Constitution that has a comparable popular chain of title, and it is precisely that  democratic ancestry that gives our Constitution its intense claim to democratic  legitimacy. This is a claim which necessarily extends to the fundamental feature of  that Constitution: federalism. Conservatives, with their intense concern for legitimacy,  have valued both the Constitution and its federalism accordingly.

The traditions of Labor regarding the Constitution are significantly different, as  already has been noted. Having dealt itself out of the Federation decade, Labor never  has had any particular sense of ownership of the Constitution. It also has had a  particular distaste for particular elements of the Constitution - such as the monarchy -but most notably for its central feature, federalism. Indeed, it is not going too far to  say that at the heart of the Labor Party’s traditional hostility towards the Constitution  is a deep enmity towards the notion of federalism.

The straightforward reason for this hostility is that Labor historically has been  philosophically opposed to federalism as a form of government. Thus, Labor  traditionally has seen itself as the party of change and reform, and understood that to  effect change a party requires ready access to power. The most obvious repository of  pervasive power in the Australian federation is the national government. Federalism,

3

_____________________________________________________________________

by dividing power, inhibits the exercise of power by the national government and it  therefore follows that federalism is a threat to any party in favour of rapid reform and  cohesive change. To a significant extent, reality has followed theory. In the period  since 1900, many Labor initiatives in such areas as price-fixing and the nationalisation  of banks have been frustrated by the federal character of the Australian Constitution.  The result has been that hostility to federalism has become a major article of Labor  faith, and has been expressed in a variety of forms: from Gough Whitlam’s flirtation  with regional governments as a means of undermining the States, to Bob Hawke’s  Boyer lectures proposing the abolition of the States. The fundamental point is that  Labor’s hostility to federalism has been based on a philosophical attitude toward  power and change, and toward the power to effect change.

That attitude needs to be contrasted very clearly with the historic conservative defence  of federalism. Obviously, conservatives always have been inclined to defend the  Constitution and its federalism as their own handiwork, but they have also have  defended federalism as a matter of principle. This has been on the basis of  philosophical suppositions fundamentally opposed to those of Labor. Essentially,  Australian conservatives have defended federalism because it is a characteristic of  conservatives to be suspicious of power, to fear its concentration and misuse, and  therefore to seek to divide and balance it. Two obvious constitutional manifestations  of such suspicion are to be found in bicameralism and the separation of powers, but its  greatest expression in an Australian context is federalism, with its comprehensive  division of power between the spheres of the Commonwealth and the States.

This is classic United States constitutional theory, of which Founders like Barton and  Deakin were deeply aware, and which underlaid their adoption of federalism as a  form of government. The result has been that Australia’s conservatives historically  have understood and accepted federalism as a means of achieving their fundamental  goals of dividing power, making power accountable, separating power, and limiting  power. Consequently, they have been temperamentally supportive of federalism, even  when they found it irritating. This has meant that, while conservative governments  might on particular occasions succumb to the political temptation to violate  federalism, they would struggle against doing so, and invariably would feel dirty in  the morning if they fell. That monumental compromise between federalism and  pragmatism, Sir Robert Menzies, was a good example of this tendency:

All this being said, the central conclusion of this lecture will in fact be that the historic  alliance between Australian conservatism and Australian constitutional federalism  apparently is over, and that after a century of ideological convergence, we now face  the spectacle of an ostensibly conservative government in Canberra waging war on  federalism. In suggesting this, I am not naÃÂ¯vely asserting that Australian federalism  has been in robust good health for the past one hundred years. We all know of the  progressive decline of Australian federalism and the States. We all understand the  implications of vertical fiscal imbalance. We all comprehend that the Commonwealth  has made constant legislative incursions into the domains of the States, and the  reasons this has occurred: the substantial failure of the Senate (despite occasional  flashes of regional integrity) to operate as a States’ House; the utter failure of the High  Court to act as a neutral constitutional arbiter; and the inability of the Founders to  secure an adequate federal financial settlement within the Constitution. We all  acknowledge that, as a consequence of these factors, the States for at least four

decades increasingly have operated as service deliverers for the Commonwealth,  although they have not collapsed as institutions, and continue to command a  significant popular allegiance from their citizens.

Noting this lengthy litany of federal woes, one might question whether yet another  aggressive, predatory, hubristic Commonwealth government really was of any great  significance, as opposed to constituting business as usual. Yet the ultra-centralism of  the Howard Government - more correctly, its power monopolism - is in reality of  enormous significance in Australia’s constitutional history. This is because for the  first time in that history, there is no Australian party of federalism, in the sense that  there is no political party fundamentally, philosophically committed to federalism as a  political ideal. Both major parties, it would appear, are psychologically opposed to the  federal division of power, and this represents an extraordinarily dangerous period for  Australian federalism. It is a time that requires us to think quite carefully about the  sorts of arguments we traditionally bandy back and forth as to whether we should be a  federation, whether federalism is a good idea, or whether its day in Australia is past.

Federalism: Attacks and Defences  That brings me very briefly to the whole question of the arguments against federalism,  both traditionally, and as put forward enthusiastically today under the Howard  Coalition Government. These arguments are very familiar in some parts of the  country, less so in others. What is correct thought in Sydmelberra - that fashionable  strip that runs from the North Shore, through the staff bar of the Australian National  University, stopping a decent distance from Geelong - is social death in Perth.  Certainly, such arguments reached a peak of popularity under the reign of Prime  Minister Gough Whitlam, and the present incumbent seems to have inherited from his  predecessor a filing cabinet full of useful material, which he is enthusiastically  recycling. To live in Australia is to be familiar with most of these arguments, which  usually are advanced as if there is no possible refutation. In reality, few are lay down  miseres, and I will present them together with the more obvious lines of response.

A common opening salvo is that the States are an historical necessity for which  the reason has now passed: let us decently euthanize them as quickly as possible.  The obvious response is to observe, firstly, that too much is taken for granted here:   there are potentially some good arguments for keeping the States that need to be  examined. A second observation might be that if the federal bargain is to be dissolved,  then let it be by democratic referendum, and not by creeping political thuggery.  Almost invariably, centralizers have no taste for popular constitutionalism, as its  results invariably are uncongenial to their cause.

Centralists next condemn federalism as complex and expensive, railing against  plump State bureaucracies and obese State parliaments. A plausible response is  that if federalism is complex, expensive and difficult, so is democracy. In both  cases, the question is not simply how much it costs, but what you get for the  money and effort you expend, which redirects the argument into a much more  profitable line of  inquiry. One might also politely wonder what would be more  expensive: the existing governmental apparatus of the States, or the vastly inflated  Commonwealth bureaucracy that would take over their functions in a unitary  Australia?

_____________________________________________________________________

On a similar tack, we constantly are told that we have too many levels of  government in Australia. Yet again, the real question is not how many levels you  have, but what you get for having them. Of course, in Western Australia - and  occasionally in Queensland - protagonists of the States are tempted to agree with  that proposition, and suggest that the dispensable tier of government resides in  Canberra.

Perhaps the most popular argument of centralism, as recently reprised by the  Commonwealth Minister for Health, Tony Abbott, is that federalism in Australia  involves duplication and divided accountability in government. There is  considerable truth in this argument. One of its dangers for centralisers, however, is  that much of the difficulty in this context has occurred because the  Commonwealth, through use of its financial muscle, has invaded State areas, such  as education and health. Confusion of accountability and responsibility thus may  be sheeted home to Commonwealth incursion, not State incompetence. In these  circumstances, a reasonable State response might well be that if the  Commonwealth is prepared to vacate the field and leave the cheque behind, the  State would be more than happy to eliminate all elements of division and overlap.

One of the more condescending positions in the centralist Kama Sutra is that the  States are entirely artificial, deriving their existence merely from marks on a colonial  map. No-one claims that every detail of the State borders was writ by God. On the  other hand, if you think that Broome might quite reasonably form part of Tasmania,  you have serious difficulties that have nothing to do with constitutional disposition.  Moreover, even if originally the Sates were creatures of cartography, New South  Wales (for example) now has existed longer than the oldest French Republic. Is it not  remotely possible that in the course of these two centuries, it may have developed  some genuine element of personality, along with some degree of institutional  legitimacy? A closely allied argument of centralism is that, whatever the reality of  their geography, there is no real difference between the States, or at least none  sufficient to justify their separate constitutional existence. This is a position extremely  easy to believe in Canberra looking towards Sydney, but miserably implausible in  Cairns looking towards Fremantle.

A rather more silky claim is that it is not so much that one has anything against  the States, as that regional governments would be so very much better. They  would be even more local, even more responsive and even more community-based. Best of all, they would have no constitutionally independent existence and  therefore would be incapable of seriously resisting any incursion from Canberra.  Whereas a disheartened State Premier can still say “No” (or at least “I’d rather  not”), all a regional gauleiter will be able to manage will be “Yes - how quickly?”

In the final analysis, therefore, the classic articulations of the arguments against  federalism from Whitlam to Hawke to Howard are at best debatable. The real question  is what, if any, are the counter arguments for federalism, and how persuasive are  they? These arguments rarely are considered explicitly in Australia. In Canberra, their  very existence is ignored, while in Brisbane and Perth, their conceptual lines often are  blurred beneath the tub-thumping rhetoric of States Rights. What is most notable  about the federalist case, when it is articulated, is the extreme clarity of the connection

6

The New Centralism

between federalism as a constitutional philosophy, and federalism as a conservative  philosophy embedded in a constitution.

Thus, many of the most significant arguments for federalism go directly to that  defining conservative obsession with the dispersion of power. Such arguments are  familiar to any Beginners’ Class in American Constitutional Law, if not to the average  Australian Prime Minister, and begin with simple proposition that federalism divides  power, ensuring that no one government has power over everything, everywhere, at  the same time. The high expression of this is that Australian federalism prevents a  Sydney Napoleon. The low expression is that no Australian Prime Minister ever will  have quite the degree of power he feels he deserves unless his government  simultaneously controls the price of dingoes in Darwin and the incidence of post-modernism in Melbourne, and under federalism, this never will happen. In this sense,  federalism has a strong analogy with the separation of powers, a term invented by the  late Sir Joh Bjelke Petersen. Just as separation of powers divides power analytically,  federalism divides power geographically, but to the same end:  protecting liberty of  action.

The second line in the defence of federalism is that it balances the powers of  governments, one against the each other. This is a substantially different point to that  relating to the division of power. By creating a Commonwealth and six state  governments, Australia’s federal Constitution ensures seven competing policy  discourses and critiques on virtually every important subject, with the result that our  political system generally is programmed not to let things go through to the keeper  without discussion. An obvious case in point is that whereas recent anti-terrorism  legislation passed through the Federal Government, Opposition, House of  Representatives and Senate virtually untroubled, and it was the exigencies of  federalism and the States that forced its deeper debate and reassessment.

The third basic federal proposition is that federalism brings government closer to the  people. It allows the people of the States to make decisions about what happens in  their state, a right particularly valuable the further you move from Canberra and the  less conditions in your backyard resemble those in Manuka. The problem with this  concept is that it has something of a marketing difficulty in Australia, where it is  marketed under the distinctly unappealing trade name of “States Rights”, thus  conjuring up visions of red-necked Western Australians culling rare wallabies for  profit. In Europe, it is sold under much more euphonic name of “subsidiarity”, which  brings up visions of Tuscans sipping locally-drawn mineral water and eating  regionally denominated olives. The principle, however, is the same, from Fremantle to  Florence: so far as possible, locals should make local decisions.

The fourth proposition flows logically from this: just as federalism recognizes the  rightness of local decision-making, so it accepts its effectiveness. Federalists believe  as an article of demonstrable faith that federalism promotes better policy decisions in  divergent locations by matching local expertise to local problems. The reality again is  that, in Australia, this proposition becomes markedly more apparent the further you  move from the eastern seaboard and the more it dawns upon you that Australia is a  vast nation with vastly different conditions applying in its widely separated states. On  this basis, it is an at least plausible suggestion that decisions might be better made  people who actually know something about the conditions in which they will apply. In

7

this context, hard questions need to be asked: for example, precisely what does  Canberra know about indigenous education in the Kimberly, or environmental  planning for far North Queensland; and would it not be better if health planning for  Adelaide was determined by someone who had once drunk its water?

A fifth proposition, very American in style, is that federalism promotes policy  innovation. In other words, where one has a single national government, one  necessarily has only one single national policy arena, and the opportunity for  experimentation is correspondingly limited and crude. The effect is that a monolithic  national policy in any given area either will get things comprehensively right  (uncommon, but not impossible) or unremittingly wrong (not inevitable, but  depressingly common). By way of contrast, where you have a national government  and six States each experimenting with different policy possibilities, the logic is that a  range of different policy possibilities will be tested: those proving effective will be  generally adopted, while those which fail will be discarded. The great example of this  tendency always cited is the introduction of compulsory seatbelt legislation in  Victoria, an initiative which subsequently swept not only the Australian federation,  but the developed world.

Policy diversity also is a potent obstacle to overall policy disaster. If an omni-competent national government accidentally devastates, say, the school education  system, recovery in a policy environment of nation-wide scorched earth will be slow  and painful. In a federation like Australia’s, the school education system can never be  comprehensively put to the torch, and if pockets of it are sacked, there always will be   surviving neighbours from which lessons for recovery may be drawn.

The final proposition of federalism is this: it promotes diversity as a given good. It is a  peculiarity of Australians that although we have learned to love multiculturalism, in  the sense that we embrace cultural difference drawn from outside Australia, we are  much more ambivalent towards difference arising within Australia. Consequently, we  admire Italian cooking and the Irish sense of humour, but if one dares suggest that a  Tasmanian is different in any way from than any other Australian (except in being  inbred) you will be greeted with absolute incredulity. One advantage of federalism is  that it does take the different quirks, the small things that make our State populations  vary from each other, and actually celebrates, rather than represses them.

Strung together like this, with its obsession for the division and balancing of power;  its insistence that regional difference be recognized and preserved; its belief in local  decision-making and capacity; and its contempt for centralized policy apparatus,  federalism breathes the philosophy of liberal conservatism as much as our  Constitution breathes federalism. It is no great wonder, then, that when a very aged  Sir Robert Menzies was asked to name his greatest mistake, that sometimes chequered  federalist replied that it was his creation of a plausibly national capital in Canberra.  With the sordid requirements of day-to day power past, Menzies was free to talk not  as a politician, but as a liberal conservative.

One more point general point should be made about Australian federalism, before  returning at greater length to its relationship with conservatism. This concerns the  perplexing tendency of Australians to be ashamed that their country is a federation, as  if this simply were not “best world practice”. The reality is that federalism is not an

8

The New Centralism

intellectual constitutional pariah. On the contrary, federalism is a perfectly acceptable  fashion accessory on the streets of places like London and Paris. To begin with, it is  not an aberrant from of government: around forty per cent per cent of the world’s  population live under some form of federal government, and these include some of the  most advanced democracies in the world, such as the United States, Canada, Germany  and Switzerland. Secondly, and contrary to the view of many Australian economists  and federal politicians, there is absolutely no necessary correlation between being an  economic basket-case and a competition cesspool, and a federation. Again, just as  countries such as the United States, Canada, Germany and Switzerland are stand-out  democracies, they also are stand-out economies.

Indeed, the current world movement is, if anything, towards rather than away from  federalism. As we watch devolution in the United Kingdom, with the creation of  Welsh and Scottish legislatures; the inexorable moves of the European Union toward  becoming a quasi-federation; and the increasing federalisation of unitary states as  diverse as Belgium and Spain in an attempt to accommodate diverse political  pressures, we appreciate very much that federalism is a rich, world phenomenon, and  that it is the crude, uncritical centralism of the sort currently being promoted by the  Howard Government that is deeply outmoded.

The Collapse of the Conservative Constitution  The depth of the link between federalism and conservative thought makes its current  repudiation by Australian conservatives truly remarkable.  That repudiation is clearly  evident in at least two contexts. The first is rhetoric, where the voice of the present  Commonwealth government is raucously anti-federal. Probably the best exposition of  this type of rhetoric is comprised in Prime Minister Howard’s speech to the Menzies’  Research Centre in Melbourne earlier this year. Essentially, his argument was that  federalism in Australia was to be seen as an eccentric and regrettable impediment to  good government, not to be maximised, but rather determinedly to be minimised. Mr.  Howard did not actually advocate the abolition of the States, although from the tone  of his speech this manifestly was a matter of political and constitutional expediency,  not policy desirability. Nevertheless, he made it clear that, given the unlikely  opportunity, he certainly would consign the States to the midden heap of history.  Similar comments repeatedly have been made by other members of the Howard  Cabinet, such as Minister for Health, Mr. Tony Abbott.

The second expression of the conservative Howard Government’s utter disdain for  federalism comes in concrete form in its programs. Here, the reality quite simply is  that the Commonwealth government is now pursuing the widest and most intense  attack on the States and federalism since the Second World War. One merely has to  consider the fronts upon which the Commonwealth is advancing: industrial relations;  hospitals and health; a possible national certificate of education; Commonwealth  technical colleges; possible control of universities; ports; overall infrastructure  planning; uniform defamation law; and aspects of State taxation. It is a remarkable  list, and one that comprises the sort of general constitutional surge that would bring a  smile to the faces of those two historic proponents of unfettered centralism, Edward  Gough Whitlam and Attila the Hun.

The genuine conservative critique of this mutant conservative constitutionalism is a  bitter one. It begins by noting that Howard’s Canberran monopolism is opposed to

9

_____________________________________________________________________

every principled element of the Australian liberal conservative tradition. From Deakin  to Menzies, federalism uniformly has been asserted as a fundamental conservative  constitutional value. That position of principle now has been discarded in favour of  the transitory opportunities of power.

Secondly, as already has been suggested, Howard’s disdain for federalism is deeply  inconsistent with any professed devotion to the Australian Constitution. Numerous  members of the Howard Cabinet are fond of professing their love for the Constitution,  and proclaiming it the “best constitution in the world”, particularly in the interest of  defending the monarchy. In the mouths of deeply pragmatic centralists, these  testimonials are mere humbuggery and rank constitutional hypocrisy.

Thirdly, the current attack on federalism is fundamentally opposed to conservative  philosophy. This is because it is aimed purely towards the aggregation and  enhancement of government power, and is directly opposed to the dispersion and  division of government power embodied in all real conservative philosophy. Indeed,  in its determination to conglomerate, to centralise and to enhance power in Canberra,  the imperatives of the Howard Government have nothing to do with the traditional  conservative thought, but rather are deeply consistent with the philosophical positions  of the old Labor power addicts, who must be chuckling in their political graves as  they watch an ostensibly conservative party do the anti-federal work that they were  never able to carry out themselves.

By way of brief digression, it may be noted that there have been some flailing  attempts to re-write conservative philosophy in a manner more congenial to Howard’s  monopolist agenda. One of the more amusing is to be found in the suggestion,  sometimes made in the context of industrial relations reforms, that it is consistent with  conservative principle for a government to preside over a massive centralisation of  power, so long as that power will be used for the purpose of conferring greater  individual liberty. Probably the most apt response is to mourn that Benito Mussolini,  that master of expediency, died without the opportunity to savour such a position. In  the first place, it is never permissible to subvert fundamental constitutional principle  to attain a particular “good” result, because constitutional principle then becomes  nothing more than the doormat for the “good” idea of every passing prime minister.  Second, as true conservatives always have understood, once power is concentrated for  a supposedly benign purpose, it can just as easily be turned to malevolent ends.

This leads on to the fourth basic inconsistency between conservative thought and  Howardite monopolism, which is that while conservatism always has taken a  characteristically far-sighted view both of history and the potential for the misuse of  power, the latter is miserably short-sighted. Thus, the unthinkable thought that has to  be kept in mind as the Howard administration amasses its vast power in such areas as  industrial relations and education is that one day, like Ozymandias, even John Howard  and his government will pass away. When this occurs, as inevitably it must, a Labor  Government will inherit the prodigious legislative artillery created by Howard and his  fellow power enthusiasts, and these great guns will be turned upon precisely those  weak-minded conservatives who created them. This is the whole point of conservative  philosophy. By dividing power, conservatives accept that they will not get it all their  own way, but guarantee the same of their opponents. Howardite monopolism is a  constitutional mug’s game of double or nothing.

The New Centralism



Moving briefly from the realms of principle, it is worth noting that pragmatism also  looks askance at elements of the Howard centralist manifesto. Put simply, why on  earth does the Commonwealth want some of these areas that it is eyeing so  covetously? Why does it desire schools and hospitals? These are the Vietnams of  Australian public administration, and out of their jungles no minister emerges alive, as  any State incumbent will testify. The prospect of a Commonwealth government that  actually has developed a taste for running schools and regulating bed-pans is one of  the great and improbable marvels of a new century.

All of this naturally raises the interesting question of Labor’s position on federalism in  a fallen conservative world. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Labor is showing considerable  confusion at the sight of its opponents tearing up their own constitutional birthright.  The pragmatics of political opposition would suggest the opportunity for an unlikely  assault in defence of federalism, but long-standing inclination seems to demand  grudging support for this act of conservative constitutional suicide.

In fact, there are a number of reasons why Labor might begin the arduous process of  rethinking its position on federalism. One is because the entire supposition of Labor  being endemically opposed to federalism was based on the notion that Labor was the  party of radical change and policy innovation in Australia, and therefore needed  access to unqualified repositories of power. Anyone who still believes Labor is the  party of policy radicalism needs swift and effective counselling. In truth, Labor now  stands for the preservation of a wide range of social features - from trades unions to a  high-impact social welfare system - all of which are under serious policy assault from  the genuinely feisty forces of the Right. In these circumstances, a constitutional  philosophy based upon the division and balance of power, and that is protective of  social consensus, starts to make solid sense.

A second factor concerns modern Labor’s professed wariness over misuse of  governmental power. In such contexts as the war against Iraq and the treatment of  refugees, Labor talked a great deal of late about the need for checks and balances  upon power, the undesirable concentration of power in too few unresponsive hands,  and the need for enhanced accountability in government. If any of this actually  represents serious positions, as opposed to political point-scoring, it is deeply  consistent with federal values. So is Labor’s general obsession with “community”.  Maybe the time has come for the Labor Party to consider whether or not there might  be possibilities in federalism that have hitherto been ignored. More pragmatically, a  Labor approaching its second decade in opposition needs weapons platforms, and it  no longer commands the Senate. The States comprise a weapons platform par  excellence, and Labor needs to think hard about their place in its political thought.

Of course, there is one other player to be taken into account in this constitutional  comedy, the one referred to with no sense of irony during the Federation debates as  “the keystone to the federal arch”. Much of the success of the Howard Government’s  strategy of power monopolisation will depend upon the attitude of the High Court.  Historically, it is a truism to say that the High Court has been no friend to the States,  with the Commonwealth-appointed Court basically playing undertaker to Canberra’s  hit-man. Yet, remarkably, the Howard government does have some little reason to  worry about the anti-federal reliability of the present Court. One is that the

government has worked hard to create what often is referred to as a “capital-C  conservative” High Court. The problem with capital-C conservatives is that they are  not only politically conservative, but are also constitutionally conservative, and so (for  all the reasons canvassed above) tend to be federalists. It will be very interesting to  see how some of these judicial conservatives react when they are confronted with the  most determined attack on Australian constitutionalism in half a century.

The second factor is that the High Court does not like being taken for granted. The  last time the Commonwealth blithely assumed the complicity of the Court was in the  early 1990s, when it was attempting to assume complete control of the corporations  law. It boasted that it would have a wonderful win in the High Court, but in the event,  the Commonwealth lost the Corporations case in a humiliating six-one decision.  Now, everyone in the Howard Government is saying that the Justices are in the bag,  and that this specially-crafted High Court will deliver. I wonder. It is interesting to  note the latest appointment to the Court, Justice Susan Crennan: a woman of markedly  independent mind; of conservative temperament, but without obvious political  commitments; and possessed of a distinct acquaintance with Catholic social justice  theory. This is not an obvious recipe for constitutional compliance, and Sir Humphrey  Appleby might well have characterised it as a courageous appointment.

Conclusion  The obvious question is, “Where do we go from here?” The answer of the Prime  Minister quite simply is that we go away from Federation, away from the liberal,  conservative, federal constitution of his political ancestors, and towards an Australia  unitary in thought, if not in constitutional structure.

What is beyond dispute is that we face a sea change in Australian constitutional and  conservative theory. Until recently, Australian federalism from the point of view of  the States had reached what might be referred to as a balance of horror. On the one  hand, the States were brutalised and financially humiliated by the Commonwealth. On  the other, things really could not go much further. The reason for this painful  equilibrium was that the States already had been reduced significantly to the status of  convenient service delivery agents for the Commonwealth, while their prime areas of  power - horrors such as schools and hospitals - were not objects that any sane  Commonwealth would covet. On balance, why would Canberra fight its own grudging  servants for possession of a poisoned chalice?

Today, we face a Commonwealth impatient of even its most compliant servants, and  prepared to invade legislative domains never before contemplated by Canberra. This  is a Commonwealth government that quite overtly has not the least interest in the  preservation of federalism or the States. If you could ask a Howard power monopolist  whether there was any policy area that could not be handled better by Canberra than  the States, the answer would be a curt negative, although some matters - sewerage and  sex offenders come to mind - presumably would be beneath the dignity of Capital Hill

What all this means is that the States are facing what used to be referred to as the  “Cornwall scenario”. Cornwall is that long English peninsula jutting into the Irish Sea  where every hopeless, displaced British tribe ends up before it makes the final  decision either to hold or be driven into the sea. This is the decision for the Australian  States, as they and the federalism they embody battle for life against a constitutional

vision of power that will brook neither rivals nor dissent. It is the supreme irony of  this crisis that it has been brought about, not by wicked communists or foolish  socialists, not by the schemes of Jim Cairns and Gough Whitlam, but by feral  conservatives who are sworn to defend precisely the federalism they are trying so  assiduously to undermine.
