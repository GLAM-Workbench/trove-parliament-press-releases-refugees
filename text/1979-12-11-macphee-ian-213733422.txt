NEW MINISTER BUT NO SUDDEN CHANGES

The new Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs,

Mr Macphee,  said today he would continue a sympathetic and evenÂ­

handed approach to administering immigration and ethnic affairs

policies.  1

"I will not be making any drastic or immediate changes."

Mr Macphee said. .

Mr Macphee,  the Member for the Victorian seat of

Balaclava, was Minister for Productivity before taking over from

Mr Michael MacKellar,  who is now Commonwealth Minister for Health.

In a special message to ethnic communities today,

Mr Macphee said:

"The Commonwealth Government has made plain its longÂ­

term commitment to immigration as an important contributor to

Australian development.

"It has translated its concern for newcomers into

practical programs that aim to provide equal opportunity and

treatment for all Australians and to encourage self help

within ethnic communities.

"I know there are a number of difficult issues to be

faced - refugee and migrant intakes,  population policies,  the

future nature of Australian society as its people come from a

wide range of ethnic backgrounds.

"I know that many communities are waiting patiently

in the hope of change that would enable us to widen the family

reunion category even further than we have been able to so far.

Government's economic policies.

electorate with many resident^ who had come from other countries

to make a.new life in Australia.

determination to succeed in their new home.

communities around Australia." 1
