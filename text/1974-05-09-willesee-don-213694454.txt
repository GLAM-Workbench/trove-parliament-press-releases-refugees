AUSTRALIAN POLICY TOWARD THE MIDDLE EAST

Senator Don Willesee, the Minister for Foreign Affairs,

said that Mr Peacock's statement today indicating that a Liberal

Government in office would have voted against Security Council

Resolutions in July last year and April of this year would

disappoint the great bulk of Australians who wished to see

Australia continue its neutral and even-handed policy in the

Middle East,

An ASRB poll published on March 25 1974 had shown that

there was strong support for the Australian Government’s

"even-handed" Middle East policy. The poll showed that 81% of

Australians believed that Australia should take a strictly

neutral position in the dispute between the Arabs and the Israelis=

Mr Peacock’s statement also appears to be at odds with the

platform of his own party, which is based on support for three

key United Nations Security Council Resolutions and in particular

support for Resolution 242= This has traditionally been the

basis of Australia’s policy in the Middle East for some years

past and remains the touch stone of Australia's neutral policy at

present = The Resolution recognises the right of Israel and other

states of the Middle East to exist within secure and recognised

boundaries but also recognises that there will be no lasting

peace in the Middle East without a resolution of the problem

of the Palestinian refugees.

Australia's present policy was directed towards achieving a

lasting and peaceful solution in the Middle East = It was

deplorable that an Australian political leader should attempt,

for short-term reasons of partisan advantage, to have Australia

take sides in a complex dispute rather than to work actively, as

the present Australian Government is doing, to bring that dispute

to an end once and for all.
