Bakhtiyari family

Minister for Immigration, Amanda Vanstone, today confirmed that the removal of the  Bakhtiyari family is currently underway.

“The family were flown out of Port Augusta overnight on a charter flight and are now out of  Australia,” the Minister said.

”The family were assessed as medically fit to travel by a doctor.

“The timing of the family’s departure was determined by the availability of the charter  aircraft and transfer arrangements en route.

“The family had been advised last week that departure from Australia was their only option  and arrangements were being made for them to return to Pakistan.”

The Minister stressed that the Bakhtiyari family had been given more than a fair go in  testing their claims for protection.

“From primary decision, through Refugee Review Tribunal hearings and 20 subsequent  legal actions, the family’s claims have been tested and re-tested,” the Minister said.

“At the end, the conclusive finding was that the family was not owed protection and,  consequently, the removal process is now being followed.

“The debate surrounding this family should not overshadow the fact that Australia has a  generous Refugee and Humanitarian Program, providing 13,000 places this year.

“About seventy per cent of people arriving under the Refugee and Humanitarian program  are from Africa, including refugees from camps in the Sudan already assessed by the  UNHCR as being in most desperate need of resettlement, as well as humanitarian cases  from Africa.”
