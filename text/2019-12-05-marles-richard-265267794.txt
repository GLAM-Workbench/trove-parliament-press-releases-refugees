THE HON RICHARD MARLES MP  DEPUTY LEADER OF THE AUSTRALIAN LABOR PARTY  SHADOW MINISTER FOR DEFENCE  MEMBER FOR CORIO





E&OE TRANSCRIPT  DOORSTOP INTERVIEW  PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA  THURSDAY, 5 DECEMBER 2019

SUBJECT: Medevac.

JOURNALIST: Would Labor be open to passing a bill that means that asylum seekers  can be resettled in New Zealand and the lifetime visa legislation comes up again for  Australia?

RICHARD MARLES, DEPUTY LEADER OF THE AUSTRALIAN LABOR  PARTY: Well we've been very consistent about this and we've made our position very  clear. You know, our view in respect of medevac is simple; if people need medical  treatment then they should be able to come to Australia and get it. And that was what  always underpinned medevac. What we actually need to know now is; what is the  arrangement that the Government has reached with Jacqui Lambie? And a lack of  transparency is what has characterised the way in which this Government has gone  about border protection, right back from the time it was elected in 2013 but in fact it's  characterised the way in which it's gone about Government. This is a matter in the  national interest. We should patently be seeing exactly what is the arrangement that  the Government has reached with Jacqui Lambie.
