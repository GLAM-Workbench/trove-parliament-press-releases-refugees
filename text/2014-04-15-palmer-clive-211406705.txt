Making a difference in Fairfax  Better highways, hospitals and help for struggling farmers are just some of the  hallmarks of federal Palmer United Party leader Clive Palmer’s time in office since  becoming the Member for Fairfax.

Mr Palmer said he was honoured to be working for the people of Fairfax who until  now had been taken for granted by the major parties for generations.

“I am pleased to be putting the people of the Sunshine Coast first for once,’’ he said.

“These achievements and on-going activities show that one person can make a  difference and that a vote for any Palmer United Party candidate represents a valuable  investment in Australia’s future - not a wasted vote,’’ Mr Palmer said.

“From local grass roots issues to matters of national importance which impact all our  lives, I will continue to work hard to give the people of Fairfax the representation they  deserve.”
