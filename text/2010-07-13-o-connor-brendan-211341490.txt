Border Protection Command intercepts vessel

ACV Holdfast Bay, operating under the control of Border Protection Command, last night  intercepted a suspected irregular entry vessel north west of Ashmore Islands.

Initial indications suggest there are 71 passengers and 3 crew on board.

The vessel was initially detected by a Customs and Border Protection Dash 8 aircraft,  operating under the control of Border Protection Command.

The group will be transferred to Christmas Island where they will undergo security, identity  and health checks and their reasons for travel will be established.

While their nationality is yet to be confirmed, if these asylum seekers are Afghans, the  processing suspension introduced by the Government on 9 April 2010 will apply.
