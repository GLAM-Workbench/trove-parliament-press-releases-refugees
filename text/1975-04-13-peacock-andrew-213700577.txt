'  POSITION PAPER - THE KHMER REPUBLIC ( CAMBODIA) ^

PREPARED BY MR. IAN SINCLAIR, M.P0, MR. ANDREW PEACOCK, M.R. & MR. JOHlÂ·  SULLIVAN, M.P. The present situation within the Khmer Republic is extremely  disturbing.

In broad terms the major population centres of the Khmer are  held by Government forces while the rural areas of the Khmer  are held by insurgent Khmer Rouge forces.

The Khmer Rouge Forces are supplied with weapons and ammunition Ã¢ÂÂ  Â·   from the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (North Vietnam) and the  People Republic of China.

In some cases, elements of the Khmer Rouge Forces are officered  by officers drawn from the North Vietnam Army.

Cadre Training has been made available to members of the Khmer  Rouge Forces in both the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and  the People Republic of China.

The present situation, is that Phnom Penh is on the verge of  imminent collapse, according to the latest news reports.

The departure recently of the President of the Khmer Field  Marshal Lon No. 1, and Prime Minister Mnsr. Long Boret to Indonesia,  allowed for the setting of the stage for the negotiated settlement  of the conflict now taking place. Mr. Long Boret has now returned

to Phnom Penh followirigpn route in Bangkok, regarding a settlement.

The problems of the Khmer Republic are aggravated by the fact that it is suffering from tenuous lines of supply. The Mekong |

River has been heavily mined preventing ships bringing supplies and the people of Phnom Penh and the other major centres loyal to the Khmer Republic are dependent on American financed flight missions bringing rice from Thailand.

Ã¢ÂÂ   On an average daily basis 50 loads of rice are brought to the  Khmer Republic in DCS aircraft. .

Within Phnom Penh the present situation is desperate.-

The city which has grown in population over the past two years  from 700,000 to two million people, many of them impoverished  and desperate refugees, in near collapse.

Within the refugee camps, serious malnutrition is evident  and daily many of the young, the weak and the old are dying .

of disease, which can be prevented by the provision of simple  medical aid.. .

2

The monetary economy of the Khmer is totally dislocated as a  result o^f the fighting and the collapse of the gross national  product. .  .

North Vietnam Armed Forces are using the North East hinterland  of Cambodia so as to allow the incursion of their troops into  the Republic of Vietnam.

The recent dismissal of the Army Chief of Staff, General' Fernandez, in favour of General Sakutch Sakhan, who is also acting  as Defence Minister has drawn wide approval, bevause General  Sakhan is looked upon as an excellent soldier.

Within areas controlled by the Khmer Rouge there are many reports  of widespread imprisonment of local citizens.

The lifeline to the city is Pochentong Airport, ten kilometers ,   from the city, which yesterday came under mortar attack, as well  as rocket attack.

Australia shofild offer its offices in association with .  ; ÃÂ¾  other countries who believe such a step should be taken ‘   so as to enable negotiations to take place between the ,  *>  two opposing sides, on the adoption of the ceasefire. 'v"

There should be a phebiscite among the peoples of the  Khmer undertaken under the auspices of the United Nations  so as to allow the people to determine themselves what form  of Government and what Government they want for their  country. Australia should call upon the Democratic Republic of  Vietnam and the Peoples Republic of Chinaa to stop refurbÂ­

ishing the forces of the Khmer Rouge with arms and  ammunition.

Australia through diplomatic initiative, should call for  a meeting of the United Nations Security Council to discuss  the situation within the Khmer.

Australia should support action by the United Nations High  for refugees to assist refugees throughout Kmer as now  agreed to in North and South.Vietnam,

Encouraging action through the United Nations Security .   Council to introduce inspection teams capable of freely  moving .throughout the Khmer to investigate human tragedy  and to recommend steps capable of relieving it by
