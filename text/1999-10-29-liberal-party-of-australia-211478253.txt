NEW CAMPAIGN TO STOP ILLEGAL ENTRANTS

Â

A new Overseas Information Campaign aimed at stopping illegal air 
and boat arrivals to Australia was launched in S ydney today by 
the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock.

Â

“The campaign will see a range of publicity material 
distributed throughout high risk people smuggling source countries as 
well as transit countries,” said the Minister, and warn people of 
the risks associated with trying to enter Australia illegally and the 
penalties smugglers face.

Â

“We will be sending a clear message that people 
thinking about undertaking such a trip will fail, will be mined financially 
and could even die. We will emphasise that Australia is introducing 
even tougher penalties for people smugglers.”

Â

Mr Ruddock said the campaign would have both an international 
and domestic focus. On the international front, the campaign will target 
would be illegal entrants in high risk source countries, such as China, 
Iraq, Sri Lanka, Turkey, as well as people smugglers in transit countries 
such as Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia and Papua New Guinea.

Â

“Campaigns will be tailor made for individual countries 
to ensure they are culturally appropriate” said the Minister, and 
include videos, radio news clips, posters and special information kits 
that will be translated into 12 languages. These items will be distributed 
to media outlets by DIMA staff on the ground.

Â

“On the domestic front,’ said the Minister, “I 
am calling on all Australians to let their friends and relatives know 
that the message is clear: pay a people smuggler and you’ll pay the 
price.

Â

“People must understand that Australia welcomes 
migrants — not illegal entrants.”

Â

To help migrants in Australia spread the message in 
their country of origin, Mr Ruddock said four information leaflets had 
been developed. The leaflets explain what happens to illegal air and 
boat arrivals, what the Australian Government is doing to stop arrivals, 
why people must help stop illegal entrants and how they can to do so.

Â

The leaflets have been translated into Chinese (standard), 
Arabic and Bahasa Indonesia and will be translated into other languages 
in due course.

Â

Mr Ruddock said the Overseas Information Campaign 
was just the latest

Government initiative aimed at curbing the increase 
in people arriving illegally in

Australia.

Â

“In the last week alone,” said the Minister, “we 
have seen an extra 168 people arrive on our shores.

Â

Mr Ruddock said the launch of the Overseas Information 
Campaign was yet another opportunity for the Government to remind people 
of the tough new penalties for people smugglers  1  
such as the recent introduction of 20-year jail terms for traffickers 
and fines of up to $220,000.

Â

Other recent measures include legislation introducing 
tests such as fingerprinting and palm recognition, to ascertain the 
true identity of asylum seekers, and to ensure they do not already have 
protection elsewhere, or have been refused refugee status overseas.

Â

The Government also recently introduced legislation 
to give DIMA and Customs officers powers to board and detain boats in 
international waters suspected of being involved in people smuggling.

Â

“With today’s launch,” said the Minister, “the 
Australian Government is sending a clear message that we will do everything 
in our power to stop smugglers who trade in human cargo. We also want 
to emphasis that attempting to enter Australia illegally is not worth 
the risk.

Â

“If you pay a people smuggler then you pay the price 
when you are sent home to a possible lifetime of debt.”
