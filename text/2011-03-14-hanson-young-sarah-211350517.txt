Need For Greater Accountability And Transparency In Detention Centres



Reports of tear gas being used on asylum seekers at Christmas Island, is further  evidence that the Government’s immigration system is failing and greater  accountability is needed for Government agencies and service providers, say the  Australian Greens.

“On Friday night we saw the desperation of these people when they tried to break  out of the centre at Christmas Island. These are vulnerable asylum seekers, who  have fled their home countries. Their trauma can only be compounded by these  kinds of incidents,” said the Greens’ Immigration Spokesperson, Senator Sarah  Hanson-Young.

“Without change from the Government, these kinds of incidents are going to continue  to occur. We’ve seen this kind of escalation before during the Howard years.”

“Lots of questions will be asked about this incident and whether this kind of force is  an appropriate response to the desperation of vulnerable asylum seekers. It has  never been appropriate that these facilities are run by private companies. There  must be accountability and transparency in the system.”
