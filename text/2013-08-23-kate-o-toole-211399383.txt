KATE O’TOOLE:

Good morning Mr Abbott, how are you?

TONY ABBOTT:

Kate, I’m fine. It was a pleasure to be out there with First Brigade and I was thrilled that some of the  youngsters in A Squadron went easy on me when I was doing PT with them this morning.

KATE O’TOOLE:

One of the discussions that has been happening on radio this morning Mr Abbott is the discussion around  hospital funding - Chief Minister Adam Giles says if the Opposition would match the current Government’s  commitment of $110 million to fund a Palmerston or elsewhere hospital. That would be grand. Would you  match that funding?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I’ll be meeting with the Chief Minister Adam Giles later on today and after the discussions that I’m  looking forward to having with him, I may well have something more to say about it, but obviously there is  a real health need here in the Territory and the Coalition wants to do its bit to match it, but one of the things  that I will be announcing this morning is upgraded coverage for defence force families. They’ll get free GP  care and they’ll get help towards their allied health professional costs. It’s a $100 million announcement  over four years. It’s to deliver on a promise that Mr Rudd made back in 2007, but never actually kept to  ensure that defence force families have got better access to health care.

KATE O’TOOLE:

Essentially like a private health care, health insurance scheme for defence is it?

TONY ABBOTT:

It’s different from that Kate - what we’re saying is that if you’ve got out-of-pocket costs for visiting the GP,  we’ll meet them.

KATE O’TOOLE:

That’s for Defence families as part of this announcement. I am curious about this hospital announcement  though. We did hear yesterday from the Government, they were adding $40 million on top of their $70  million commitment. Have you committed to at least the $70 million of funding for a hospital in the top  end?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, we haven’t made any commitment yet, but I’ll be meeting with Adam Giles later today and I’m sure  he’ll make a very good case and we’ll respond appropriately.

KATE O’TOOLE:

One of the issues that’s in the headlines this morning is the issue of border protection and your spokesman  for Immigration, Scott Morrison said this morning that the Coalition would spend $67 million on providing  more AFP officers and deploying them into Indonesia and Sri Lanka and Malaysia. What would those AFP  officers actually be able to do in those jurisdictions?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, they’ll work very closely with the local police to try to ensure that people smuggling is properly  cracked down upon. There has been a lack of AFP resources in these other countries. We’ve only got one  AFP officer in Sri Lanka for instance. There’s been a reduction of AFP officers in Indonesia and given the  people smuggling problem that we face, that’s absolutely the wrong way to go. So…

KATE O’TOOLE:

What sort of role do they have though? Obviously it’s not their jurisdiction, they can’t arrest people there or  anything like that?

TONY ABBOTT:

No, but they can work very closely with Indonesian officers and look, there’s no mystery to how this  happens, for instance, after the Bali bombing, our police worked very closely with Indonesian Police to help  track down the Bali bombers and bring them to justice and I’m not an operational Police person, so I can’t  give you a kind of moment-by-moment account of what our Police people do in Indonesia.

KATE O’TOOLE:

I know, but if you’re going to spend $67 million on something, you want to have an idea of what they’re  actually doing don’t you?

TONY ABBOTT:

If you want to stop the boats, you’ve got to have appropriate Police cooperation with Indonesia and with Sri  Lanka and that’s what we will do.

KATE O’TOOLE:

Have you spoken to people in Indonesia and Sri Lanka - are they happy for there to be increased numbers of  Australian officers amongst their Police forces?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, obviously it’s an offer that we make and as I said in all sorts of areas and all sorts of times Kate, the  countries in question have been happy to have cooperation from Australia. I mean, we have cut AFP  resources in Indonesia - that’s the problem. We have cut AFP resources in Indonesia. They were there, they  were doing good work. This Government has cut them. We’re going to put them back, because if you want  to stop the boats, you’ve got to have appropriate cooperation with Indonesia on the ground as well as  appropriate political cooperation.

KATE O’TOOLE:

How much will your border protection policy promises cost? There’s $67 million here for these AFP  officers. You’ve also mentioned a buy-back scheme for boats in the last 24 hours or so and more aerial  surveillance as well. What would be your total cost for these plans?

TONY ABBOTT:

The announcements that Scott Morrison and I are making later on today will cost in the order of $200  million, but in the end, if you want to save money, you stop the boats, because we’ve had since 2008, $11.5  billion worth of border protection blowouts. It’s now costing us over $3 billion a year to deal with illegal  arrivals by boat, Kate. So, sure this costs money, but it’s an investment in a safer future. It’s an investment  in a more compassionate future, because as long as the boats keep coming, as you know Kate, the people  will keep being lost at sea.

KATE O’TOOLE:

Bert has sent in a question to us on the text line asking where will the water come from for the northern food  bowl?

TONY ABBOTT:

We think that there is the potential for more dams in the north and we have identified some areas that ought  to be looked at. There are further stages to the Ord scheme. There’s the Nathan Dam in central Queensland.  There’s a dam on the Gilbert River in north Queensland that people talk about. There are off river storages  which even the current Government is talking about. So, we do need more water and if we can overcome the  dam phobia which Australian policy makers have suffered from over the last couple of decades, we’ll have  the water.

KATE O’TOOLE:

But can you rule out the Daily River?

TONY ABBOTT:

We’ve ruled that out.

KATE O’TOOLE:

That’s all we have time for this morning. Enjoy the rest of your stay in the top end.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well look it’s great to be with you Kate and it’s very important to stop the boats and we won’t rest until we  do.
