An Update On Community Detention

The Federal Government continues to move children and vulnerable families out of  detention facilities, with almost 2,000 people currently residing in or transferring into  community-based accommodation.

The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Chris Bowen MP, said as of 18 May 2012, he  had approved 4,008 people for residence determination - 2,145 adults and 1,863 children -  since the Government announced the new community detention program in October 2010.

Mr Bowen said there were currently 1,966 people in or transferring into community  detention, with 635 of those children.

“We now have 71 per cent of all children in the immigration detention network living in  community-based arrangements - that is 635 minors in the community and 281 remaining  in detention facilities,” Mr Bowen said.

“This Government recognises the importance of the community detention program and is  proud of the success the program has had in delivering appropriate care for people -  especially children - accommodated in the community while their asylum claims are  assessed.

“As always, I would also like to thank organisations such as the Australian Red Cross for the  ongoing work they do with my department in maintaining these programs.”

All eligible unaccompanied minors who arrived in Australia prior to 22 February 2012 have  now been moved into community arrangements.

All eligible accompanied children who arrived in Australia prior to 11 February 2012 have  now also been granted community placement.

The small number of children who arrived prior to these dates and who remain in detention  are not eligible for community detention due to security, behaviour or risk requirements.

“Despite unashamed scaremongering from Scott Morrison to score cheap political points, the  reality is that people who are approved for community detention are the most vulnerable in  the network because they are children, families and people with serious mental or physical  health issues,” Mr Bowen said.
