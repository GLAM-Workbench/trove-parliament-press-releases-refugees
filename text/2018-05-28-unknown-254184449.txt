Media Release: Dutton and Shorten - two sides of the same coin

May 28, 2018

Labor’s refusal to even discuss a more humane approach to refugees shows the party leadership  has learned nothing from five years of death and misery on Manus Island and Nauru, Greens  Immigration spokesperson Nick McKim says.

“Bill Shorten and the factional bosses have decided yet again to lock in behind Peter Dutton’s  campaign of misery,” Senator McKim said.

“This is a crackdown on compassion and hugely disappointing to the millions of Australians who  don’t support what is being done in their names.”

“People have died and suffered immensely because of the bipartisan cruelty on Manus Island and  Nauru.”

“That Mr Shorten won’t even allow party members to debate the issue shows how much Labor has  abandoned its moral compass.”
