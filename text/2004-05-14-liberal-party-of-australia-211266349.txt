Senator Amanda Vanstone  MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND MULTICULTURAL AND  INDIGENOUS AFFAIRS

Media Centre Decisions Handed Down on Nauru VPS 071/2004

Fifteen Afghan asylum seekers on Nauru have been granted refugee status, Minister for Immigration and  Indigenous and Multicultural Affairs, Amanda Vanstone, announced today.

'These are the first decisions to be handed down as a result of a re-examination of Afghan asylum seeker  cases on Nauru,' Minister Vanstone said.

'I gave a commitment late last year (24 December) that as a result of changed conditions in some parts of  Afghanistan, Immigration authorities in Australia would re-examine the claims of some of the Afghan  asylum seekers on Nauru.

'This re-examination included information provided by the UNHCR, which Australia takes seriously in  determining the claims of asylum seekers.

Minister Vanstone said the decisions had been handed down this morning, 14 May.

'These fifteen people will continue to receive support, including accommodation, food, clothing and  medical care, while arrangements are made to resettle them.

'Most will be offered resettlement in Australia.

'Australia has made it clear all along that it will take its fair share of refugees needing resettlement from  the offshore processing centres and this announcement confirms the Australian Government's  commitment to that.'

An additional three decisions have been made affecting Afghan asylum seekers who, it has been  determined, have no need for refugee protection.

'Those people who have again been confirmed as not needing protection should accept the outcome and  return to their home country as quickly as possible,' the Minister said.

Further decisions will be made in due course about the remaining Afghan asylum seekers on Nauru.
