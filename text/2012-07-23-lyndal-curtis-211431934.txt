Lyndal Curtis

Hello and welcome to Capital Hill. I am Lyndal Curtis. Labor has declared victory in the state by-election seat of Melbourne  but the Greens aren’t conceding yet and the Greens Deputy Leader was, on the weekend, declaring a victory of sorts,  saying the Greens had one the biggest primary vote. The policy process continues to amble along in Canberra with the

Government’s response to the Gonski review of education funding still a few weeks away yet and the cross party  committee on asylum seekers having a meeting tomorrow. Joining me to discuss the issues, Coalition Frontbencher  Michael Keenan and Greens Senator Penny Wright. Welcome to you both.

Michael Keenan

Good afternoon Lyndal, good afternoon Penny.

Penny Wright

Good afternoon Michael.

Lyndal Curtis

We will start with the Victorian state by-election. Penny your Deputy Leader Adam Bandt said of the state by-election that  party’s like Labor are only able to get into these seats through deals with the likes of Family First. Why isn’t winning a seat  on preferences a perfectly legitimate outcome?

Penny Wright

What’s really interesting about this particular by-election Lyndal is that what has been traditionally a Labor heartland for  over one hundred years has now achieved a higher primary vote for the Greens and the Greens think that that is a sign of  things to come in the future.

Lyndal Curtis

But it is not a victory. It is likely you will lose votes to Labor winning on preferences?

Penny Wright

It certainly does at this stage look like that. We haven’t conceded yet because we would rather get the final result from the  Victorian Electoral Commission, which I think is coming up later this afternoon. But not withstanding that, this is the  highest primary vote that the Greens have received in this electorate and what we know is that a decade ago Labor had a  primary vote of 59%, the Greens have increased our vote by 5-6%  and the Labor Party have slumped by 3-4%. In an  election, when there was one of the most unpopular Liberal state government’s and their was no conservative candidate  running, so what we say is yes Labor may end up making it over the line but it will only be on the basis of preferences  from party’s such as Family First, who to progressive voters are an anathema. They are anti-gay, anti-climate and I think it  is quite a sad thing that Labor has had to rely on those sorts of preferences to get over the line.

Lyndal Curtis

But didn’t Adam Bandt win his seat on Liberal Party preferences and the Liberal Party isn’t historically your best friend is  it?

Penny Wright

Adam Bandt didn’t need to do a deal where he put the Liberal Party ahead of the Labor Party because in the end when  you are asking voters who they are going to vote for, you have to look at policies and what those party’s stand for and I  think this leaves a very big question mark for progressive voters who really do want to see party’s with policies for the 21st

century. Asking them to preference a party like Family First ahead of the Greens where our values are very clear.

Lyndal Curtis

Michael as you look to the next election, if you take a seat like the one Adam Bandt won, there are some analyst saying  on the state by-election result that he may not win again if he doesn’t get Liberal Party preferences. Is it more important  for the coalition to keep Labor out or keep the Greens out?

Michael Keenan

Labor and the Greens govern in an alliance at the moment so I think it is more important to keep both of those party’s out.  They are clearly sharing an agenda at the moment because in Canberra they govern together. The preferences will be a  decision that we make closer to the time but clearly the most important thing is that we need a change in Canberra and  therefore we need a total change away from the Greens-Labor alliance to a new government that can address some of  these challenges that we are facing as a country.

Lyndal Curtis

What flows into these decisions on preferences when you look at either preferencing Labor or the Greens?

Michael Keenan

We need to make a decision by looking at the policy platforms of both parties. We believe that the Greens are a fairly  extremist party but of course our main enemy has always been the Labor Party. We will need to make those decisions on  a state by state basis closer to the time but the most important thing is that we get a majority government in Canberra to  end this Greens-Labor alliance which is doing so much damage to our country.

Lyndal Curtis

Penny, the Greens website says of the Greens preference strategy that policies were not discussed during preference  negotiations, this is a broad statement, nor should they. Adam Bandt though tended to raise suggestions that there were  deals done for preferences, aren’t preference deals usually a matter of politics rather than policy?

Penny Wright

I think it is really important that when any party is trying to decide who to preference that they look at what the various  preference throws might be but I think we all agree that it is really important that we look at the values that that party stand  for because in a sense you are giving your supporters are card that says these are the sorts of values we want to see  upheld in Parliament. This is what was really surprising and somewhat disappointing and showed the desperation of the  Labor Party, that they were prepared to say to their supporters that we would prefer you to vote for these parties rather  than the Greens whose values and policies are very clearly out there.

Lyndal Curtis

We will move on now to the issue of asylum seekers. Two more asylum seeker boats arrived today, one off Christmas  Island and the other off the Cocos Islands. Tomorrow the cross party group of MP’s who started meeting in the last week  of Parliament to try and find common ground on the issue, will meet again. They will have briefings from organisations  such as the Federal Police and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Michael this is a group that does  involve a small number of Liberal MP’s, I understand that Judi Moylan may be at the meeting tomorrow, but there is no  proposal is there that would come from this group or the expert panel or the multi party reference group that you would  agree to that is any variance to your policy is there?

Michael Keenan

We just don’t change our policies every five minutes. We have had the same policies for over a decade and there are very

good reasons why we stick to those policies because it is the only suite of policies that have actually ever had a result in  achieving the aim that we want, which is to squash people smuggling and take back control of our borders. We are always  happy to hear new ideas but quite frankly I think it is very important that we don’t use these committee processes to put off  making decisions that need to be made. The problem is we need to go back to these policies that worked and why the  Government is going through these committee processes they use that as just an excuse for not taking any further action.  We cannot afford to keep having two boats arrive illegally in our country every single day and clearly we don’t want these  committee processes to work as an alternative to doing something.

Lyndal Curtis

But even if the expert panel that does include as its chair a former chief of the defence force, proposed something that it  believed would work you wouldn’t necessarily adopt it?

Michael Keenan

We know what works. This is not just a thought bubble or an idea from one of our Opposition spokespeople. This is a  proven suite of policies that has actually achieved the objective we are after. I would hope that the expert panel look at the  policies that are available and say the reason Australia is in this situation at the moment is because the policies that  worked were changed by the Labor Party  when they came to office. If they hadn’t have done that and if they hadn’t have  broken the system of border protection that they inherited then we wouldn’t be in this situation in the first place. The  starting point should be to go back to the point when our border protection system was broken by these changes in policy.

Lyndal Curtis

Penny given that the Coalition is not going to move, is it up to the Greens then to come to the table and agree to some  sort of compromise that manages to get legislation through both Houses of Parliament?

Penny Wright

I think it is really important that we end up with a solution that is good for asylum seekers and good for humanitarianism  and not just good for politicians. One of the concerns that the Greens have is that the solution that was being debated in  the Parliament was a solution for politicians to try and get those votes off our television screens because they were  making life really unpleasant, sad and uncomfortable for all of us but they weren’t actually going to make safer pathways  for those people fleeing persecution.  What I think is really important to remember is those people that we see boarding  those boats are just the tip of the iceberg, there is a huge amount of suffering and death out there but we don’t necessarily  see it because it is not on our television screens. The Green are looking at having safer pathways and encouraging  people not to get on boats by giving hope rather than taking it away and I think the expert committee is a really fine step  because we are going to be able to take some of the politics out of it and seriously look at some of the solutions that are  being offered by people who aren’t politicians but who actually have the concerns and the interests of refugees on a broad  scale, including as you say the UNHCR.

Lyndal Curtis

One of those safer pathways that your submission to the expert panel suggests is to change visa regulations to allow  people to come to Australia by plane instead of boats, how would that work?

Penny Wright

There has been hysteria about the number of boat arrivals yet we know that there are far more people entering Australia  without the authority of papers and so on and haven’t gone through the processes, by plane. It seems to be an absolute  anomaly that we are focusing on boats to the extent that we are forcing people to end up boarding boats through  desperation when we could be processing those people in places like Malaysia and Indonesia where they are in huge  numbers and not supporting those regional partners in a respectful way. So we need to be working across the board in a  much more coherent way with a much more rationale immigration policy and not one that is just based on fear and  loathing essentially.

Lyndal Curtis

Finally on to the issue of the Gonski report into education funding. The Government is still a little way away from  announcing its final decision. I have been told that a figure of cost of $6.5 billion, that was reported this morning, isn’t right  but the Government is looking at other things it can do with increased funding. Michael if the Government tacks on things  that would improve the quality of education onto the funding reforms would that make you more likely to support whatever

the government comes up with?

Michael Keenan

We would all like to see the quality of education improved but the problem is there is no money to pay for the sorts of  expenditure that we are talking about, especially when we are talking about $6.5 billion. When money is being wasted at  such an enormous rate since the Labor Party came to power, there is no money left and the idea that we are going to fund  the Gonski reforms or the National Disability Insurance program without the cold hard cash to do it is clearly impossible. If  the Government is insistent that it is going to go through with this reform then it needs to explain to the Australian people  where they are getting the dollars from and they can only do that by one of two ways; you can cut funding from other  programs or you can raise taxes such as the Carbon Tax. If they are going to pursue this reform then they need to explain  to the Australian people where they are going to get the money from because clearly it is not there at the moment.

Lyndal Curtis

Penny isn’t that where this comes down to, that the money needs to come from both the Federal and State Governments,  it is for funding from 2014 onwards and there isn’t a lot of money there is there?

Penny Wright

This is absolutely core Greens policy, we have un-equivocately supported the Gonski review and the recommendations  because we say that we must make it a priority in 21st century Australia to give every single kid irrespective of where they  live or who their parents are an opportunity to a quality education and that means funding public education where we  know we are lagging behind in OCD for instance. We need to find that money, and the money is there Lyndal. Every  society makes decisions about what it values. We know that there was a G8 communicate recommending the abolition of  diesel subsidies, $9 billion a year, if we just decided as a society that we valued quality education based on need across  the board so that there was real choice for every single kid in Australia to get the education to develop their potential, as a  society we could do that. We know that Ken Henry has said that the mining tax has been a disappointment in terms of the  revenue that  that has brought in, that was despite the best efforts of the Greens to  try and get a proper return on that. As  a community we absolutely have to get this legislation through in time to make sure that kids don’t miss out for another  five years funding round.

Lyndal Curtis

That is all we have time for. Penny Wright and Michael Keenan thank you for you time.

Michael Keenan

Great to be with you.

Penny Wright

Thank you Lyndal.
