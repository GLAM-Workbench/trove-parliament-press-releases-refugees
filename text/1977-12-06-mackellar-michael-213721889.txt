M A C K E L L A R M .P .6 December 1977 IEA 99/77INDO-CHINESE REFUGEES"While I emphasise that the Government does not wish to make an election issue out of the Indo-Chinese refugee situation, I cannot allow the wild and irresponsible statements of the Opposition spokesman on Immigration and Ethnic Affairs,Mr Innes, to go without a response," the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs,  Mr M.J.R. MacKellar,  said today.Mr MacKellar said: "Mr Innes1  first belated election statement explains why he has been kept as far away as possible from the election campaign. Mr Innes makes a staggeringly uninformed and wrong statement that the Australian Government has done nothing about the Indo-Chinese refugee situation. This is based on the sum total of his experience with refugees apparently based on talks with *people involved in the refugee question in Singapore and Kuala Lumpur* recently.""If Mr Innes in fact had spoken to persons with any knowledge of the Indo-Chinese refugee situation he would have known that Australia has ongoing consultations with many Governments involved with Indo-Chinese refugees - including the United States,  Canada,  New Zealand, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia. He would have known that there is’  the closest co-operation between the Australian Government and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and his officers in Geneva, Thailand,  Malaysia, Singapore, Australia and elsewhere.""If he had spoken to anyone with knowledge of IndoÂ­Chinese refugees Mr Innes would have known that there has been an Australian immigration selection team in Thailand since August, that there have been four task force exercises before that to select and process Indo-Chinese refugees for entry to Australia, and that there has been a continuing intake of Indo-Chinese refugees each week since September.” . . . . n.

Mr MacKeliar said "It would be too much to expect Mr  J Innes to be aware of developments at the meeting of the Executive Committee of the United Nations High Commissioner  for Refugees held in Geneva in October .  If he had

any knowledge at all of recent developments he would know  that Australia was closely associated with initiatives taken  during the Executive Committee meeting to promote an  international effort to resolve the Indo-Chinese refugee

situation."

Mr MacKeliar said that the unfounded accusation by Mr  Innes that there is a grave doubt about the bona fides of  all the refugees reaching Australia was not simply a slur on  the refugees themselves but an unwarranted slur on other  Governments accepting these refugees for resettlement or  prov tding assistance to them. Certainly such ill-founded

and inaccurate comments are unlikely to be received favourably  by all of those who are making a genuine and continuing effort  to ease the plight of the refugees.

Mr MacKeliar stressed that every person arriving in  Australia without prior authority is subject to detailed  and strict investigation to ensure that he or she is in fact  a refugee before an entry permit is granted.  Further

investigation is made after temporary residence is approved  to ensure that the refugees8 bona fides are in no doubt  before permanent residence status is granted.
