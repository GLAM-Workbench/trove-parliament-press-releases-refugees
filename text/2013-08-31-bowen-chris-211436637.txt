SUBJECTS: Johnny Warren Institute funding announcement; Coalition  costings; Polls.   _____________________________________________________________



CHRIS BOWEN: Well thanks for coming everybody. It’s absolutely great to be here  in Bossley Park on this spectacular day to make a really great announcement. I’m  pleased to be joined by my friend and colleague, Ed Husic, the Member for Chiefly  and the unofficial convenor of the parliamentary friends of the Western Sydney  Wanderers. Also, Jamie Warren the President of the Johnny Warren Foundation and

Les Murray, Craig Foster and Emma Highwood. As well, of course, the Mayor of  Fairfield City, Frank Carbone.

Well, today we’re announcing that the Rudd Labor Government is committing $10  million in funding to the establishment of Johnny Warren Institute; building on the  work of the Johnny Warren Foundation which was established ten years ago and  has done such great work in developing the skills of young Australian footballers. It’s  time now to take this to the next stage and I’m delighted that the Rudd Labor  Government is able to commit this $10 million in funding which will see the Institute  up and running.

I’m particularly delighted that the Johnny Warren Foundation working with Mayor  Carbone have decided to make Fairfield City the home of the Johnny Warren  Institute. I’m particularly delighted given the contribution of Fairfield City and Western  Sydney to Australian Football that we’ll host the Institute. I know the Mayor is  working through with his Councillors and staff and with the Foundation identifying the  sight, identifying the contribution of Council, and making sure that work can continue  and progress.

Western Sydney is very important to football and of course we’ve produced 50 per  cent of Australia’s Socceroos over the years have come from Western Sydney, some  great names. I have to declare my interest, before you ask, my conflict of interest.  I’ve grown up in the same street as Harry Kewell, in Smithfield, around the corner

here. He use to beat me when we played street soccer, we use to call it in those  days, he’s a couple of years younger than me, I use to be annoyed when he beat me  but now I don’t feel so bad given what he has gone on to achieve.

He showed great passion and great commitment for the game. He would every  afternoon be out kicking the soccer ball against his parent’s B and D roller-door,  getting the skills up and developing his great passion for the game of football. And of  course he is a great role model for young people around this area and around  Australia more generally as are all of the people who have represented our Nation in  the sport of Football. And, as I say, 50 per cent of them have come from Western  Sydney - the home to many great football bodies, Club Marconi just around the  corner here of course, a very important and famous one but many other institutions  as well. So this is a very good day for Football, a very good day for Western Sydney  and I’m very pleased to make this announcement.

Happy to take questions.

JOURNALIST: Minister, Kevin Rudd’s ramped up his attack on the coalition  accusing them of committing fraud on the Australian people, has he gone too far?

BOWEN: No, this week we’ve pointed out that there’s real questions to answer on  the Opposition’s costings and where cuts will come. And we’ve seen Mr Abbott over  the last 24 hours say we’ll release all that at the end of next week, well hello, the  election’s next Saturday! The end of next week does not give the Australian people  enough time to see their policies and their cut in full.

And as I say, if you don’t know what they’re going to cut, don’t vote for them.  Because if you did know what they’re going to cut, you wouldn’t vote for them.

JOURNALIST: But you’ve accused them of essentially deceiving the Australian  people, that’s a very strong line.

BOWEN: Well, if you’re not going to put your cuts out until the last minute, after the  advertising blackout, after people have had the chance to fully examine their cuts  then you are not being upfront and honest with the Australian people. You know I’ve  had two debates with Mr Hockey in this election campaign, there was meant to be a  third one with him next week, he’s pulled out. He’s pulled out of the third and final  debate. Why? Well maybe he doesn’t want to face the question as to why we still  won’t see costings and cuts announced as late as next Wednesday in a five week  election campaign.

We were told constantly, the line was “You’ll see it all in good time before the  election”. Well, Thursday or Friday before polling day is not “in good time before the  election”.

JOURNALIST: Your claim that the Coalition had a $10 billion hole in their costings  has been rebuffed by public servants, has this taken the sting out of your attack?

BOWEN: No, I don’t accept the premise of that question. We were very clear when  we made this announcement. We released in the interest of openness and  transparency the Treasury and Department of Finance advice to us. We made it

crystal clear in that press conference that one - we had commissioned this work, not  the Opposition. Two - it was done before the election was called, not in the caretaker  period, therefore not under the Charter of Budget Honesty. We said that, this was  work commissioned before the election was called. And three - that different  assumptions would lead to different outcomes.

For example, I pointed out that the Opposition promising to cut the low income  superannuation bonus or payment. Now this is a very retrograde move in and on  itself, taking money away from potentially one in three working Australians earning  less than $37,000. People who can least afford it. But they’ve claimed $3.7 billion for  this save. Now, I’ve pointed out that if you think it’s going to start on 1 July 2014 then  the save is much less than that. But if you’re going to make it retrospective and take  the cut over a longer period of time going back well then you would make more  money.

Mr Hockey could clear this up today, release you costings, release your cuts, put  them out for all to see. You might criticise our press conference earlier in the week  but we put our documents out. Mr Hockey, show us your costings, show us your  cuts.

JOURNALIST: A new opinion poll in the Financial Review shows you’re trailing Ray  King in your seat of McMahon. Are you in danger of losing your seat?

BOWEN: Well, let me tell you this. I grew up here, I went to school around the  corner, I went to primary school around that corner. Representing this area is very  important to me. It’s been important to me for the nine years that I’ve represented the  area in Federal parliament and nine years before that I represented the area on  Fairfield Council. It’s not a fly-in fly-out operation for me. It’s been more vocation for

all that time.

Getting more resources for this area, getting more support for this area, dealing with  challenges and as a member of Cabinet, of course ensuring that we continue to grow  our economy which benefits this area. Now, I’ve never taken the view that any vote  is to be taken for granted, I’ve worked and earned every vote. It’s not a fly-in fly-out  operation. I still live here in this community unlike the Liberal candidate who doesn’t  live here in this community. This is not a game, this is real, like Ed, who grew up in  the area he represents, it’s what we do, it’s what we believe in and we’ll go out there  and we’ll be earning every vote until Election Day.

JOURNALIST: The poll has you only getting 46.9 per cent of the primary vote, is a  week long enough to turn that around?

BOWEN: Well, a week is plenty of time to be talking to people about our positive  plans for the future, about the Opposition’s cuts and what they’ll mean for this area  and I don’t think that every opinion poll that’s always published is necessarily always  accurate but I’ll tell you what, what I’m focused on, is I’m focused on getting the job  done for this area where I grew up and continue to represent and it’s been my great  honour to represent for the last nine years and I will be working very hard to  represent them for the next three years as well.

JOURNALIST: Kevin Rudd’s blamed the media, he’s blaming News Corp for Labor’s  bad polling, when is Labor going to take responsibility for its position in the polls?

BOWEN: Well, it’s perfectly appropriate to point out that sometimes coverage in  election campaigns is not always what everybody would call fair and balanced, that’s  a perfectly appropriate thing to point out, with all due respect to all of our good  colleague journalists here. And there are newspapers which have taken an editorial  position frankly to campaign against the Government. We’ve said all along, that’s  their right, they can do that. But when you take an editorial decision to campaign  against the Government or political party then you have to expect that to be pulled  out occasionally and be commented on.

We’re focused on next week, on being very competitive at this election. I believe that  this election will be close, I believe that we have a good case to put and obviously  we’ll all take responsibility for the result whether it be a win or otherwise.

JOURNALIST: In terms of the coalition releasing their costings, we’ve seen an  announcement about the latest asylum seeker policy to cut aid. What’s your reaction  on that?

BOWEN: Well, I haven’t seen the details on the announcement, I’ve seen some  speculation, obviously a leak of the Coalition’s announcement today and no doubt  the Minister for Immigration will respond in more detail when that announcement is  made. But I’ll say this, our approach is, although many would say it’s too hard line, is  to take people to Papua New Guinea and say that is where you will be settled, that is  where you’ll be settled. So that is what we’ll need to do in order to persuade people  from coming to Australia by boat. We make no apologies for that policy; it’s the right  policy, its right to be hard-line on these issues.

JOURNALIST: This policy (inaudible) by boat. Do you think the Government should  -

BOWEN: - Well, we’ll have a look at the detail that the Opposition has announced;  there are measures in place, which have been in place for some time, under various  Governments. We’ll have a look at the detail of what the Government announces,  what they say - often the devils in the details of these things.
