JOINT PRESS RELEASE BY THE OPPOSITION LEADER IN THE SENATE.  SENATOR ROBERT HTTJi> AND SENATOR ROD KEMP

GOVERNMENT AID GRANTS TO ACTU NEARLY S9 MILLION; OPPOSITION

The Federal Opposition today said the Hawke Government had  provided the ACTU with nearly $7 million of public aid funds  since the ALP came to office in 1983.

The Opposition said figures showed that the Government would  grant the ACTU a further $2 million in the current financial  year.

The figures have been obtained from the Government by Victorian  Liberal Senator Rod Kemp through answers to Questions on Notice.

The Opposition Leader in the Senate and Shadow Minister for  Foreign Affairs, senator Robert Hill, said the information from  the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade showed that an arm  of the Department - the Australian International Development  Assistance Bureau (AIDAB) - would provide more than $1.9 million

to the ACTU in the remainder of 1990/91.

He said the total figure included grants to:

Commonwealth Trade Union Council (CTUC) - $260,000

South Pacific and Oceania Council of Trade Unions (SPOCTU) -  $50,000

International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) -

Senator Hill said that in 1988/89, the Government, through AIDAB,  provided $250,000 to the ACTU to help promote trade unionism in  the South Pacific.

"The ACTU may have an interest in promoting international trade  unionism, but it is very difficult to see why this should be  sponsored by the Australian taxpayer," Senator Hill said.

"By anyone's standard, the amount of money granted to the ACTU  for aid functions from 1983 to June, 1990 - $6.8 million - is  enormous." .

$15,000

2.

Senator Kemp said he had no doubt that some of the aid money

granted to the ACTU reached worthwhile causes.

"However, it is difficult to see how $121,000 being paid to the  ACTU for a planning meeting of the African National Congress  (ANC) was a proper use of aid funds," Senator Kemp said,

"If such a large amount of Australian taxpayers' money is being  given to the ANC through the vehicle of the ACTU, the Australian  public should be entitled to the full details."
