PRESS STATEMENT Mir A.J. Grassby, M.H.R.,

Member for Riverina

Australians face.14 years of being poorer if the present

decision to dismantle the rural sector is not reversed.

Mr A.J. Grassby, Member for Riverina, addressing a lunchÂ­

time meeting of the Constitutional Association of Australia in

Sydney today, said Australia had already been so blinded by myths

of overproduction that the nation was not in a situation today to

Ã¢ÂÂ   provide a balanced diet for the five million Pakistani refugees.

The Federal Government has claimed it will be 1985 before

mineral earnings equal rural exports in value. Mr Grassby said

as mineral output was 71$ foreign controlled, this claim could be

challenged, but even accepting it meant we would all be poorer

because of the loss of vital export income in the 14-year interval.

Three major facts needed to be faced if the right decisions

are to be made for the future:

(1) Australia only produces enough surplus food in an average

year to provide a balanced diet for an additional three

million people;

(2) Australia is wasting money importing more than $100 millions

of food, beverages and tobacco from other countries;

(3) Australia's present living standards depend on the present

level of export income being maintained *

Mr Grassby said Australia only produced 5% of the Unijfced

States grain and oilseed output, and the United States had recently

increased its production by more than Australia's total crop. In

the past year, while Australia cried 'Surplus’, the U.S. had

increased wheat sales by two million tons, an increase which was

more than Australia's total sales.

Australia's total grain production was only half that of

Britain and one-fifth that of France in an average year.

Ã¢ÂÂ   'We have cried ourselves into a rural recession of our

own making', he declared. While crying 'Surplus' we have spent

$20 millions buying other people's fruit and vegetables; $9 millions

buying other countries oilseed products, and $10 millions importing

vegetable oils we could produce ourselves. Australia was three

times as dependent upon exports as the U.S.A. but we are busy

destroying the base for more than half our exports which are drawn

from the rural sector.

.  In the last year for which detailed statistics are

available, agriculture accounted for $1,902 millions in. exports

compared with $750 millions from minerals. A down turn .in

agriculture means a down turn in total production, a nd.Australia

will be short of foreign currency to buy the raw materials to keep

secondary industry going. Mr Grassby said it was time Australians

woke up to what was happening.

We produce a total of foodstuffs valued at the principal

markets at $5,262 million. This is sold at home for $3,360 millions,

and for export for $1 ,902 millions. Of the total of $5,2.62 millions

the farmer received only $1,239 millions. The rest of the community

gains $4,023 millions.

Australia's farm production is efficient by world standards

but marketing and distribution systems were ramshackle and out of

date. 'If the farmer gave away all his produce free, the city

housewife would scarcely notice the difference in ^he prices she

pays. Food is five times the farm gate price and the present

system exploits the consumer and the producer with fine impartiality'.

Mr Grassby said Australia was living in yesterday and there

was an urgent need for a national stocktaking before we enter a new

cycle of comparative poverty. He pointed out that a farm recession

in output of $100 millions would mean a loss to the farmer of $100

millions, a loss of $100 millions to transport systems, and those

engaged in them, and a decline of $300 millions to the domestic

millions, making a recession of $500 millions in all. This was on

the home market; while on the export market a farm recession of

output of $100 millions will mean some $500 millions losses at

home plus $200 millions in overseas purchasing power. This buying

power will not easily be built up with agriculture 56$ of overseas

purchasing, power, minerals 22$ and all other exports 22$.

Farming is a real gain for Australia as most farming is

still in Australian.hands. This is not so for mining, and the

export ear.tiings of $750 millions have to help cope with $720 millions

payable by Australia as interest and property value each year

overseas.

Mr Grassby said 1  Its about time we carried out a cost

benefit analysis of mineral development in the same way as for

rural development. The nation might get a shock to find the costs

are high, add to inflation and the benefits are negligible.'

The end result of current policy of 1  panic and retreat'

in the countryside was illustrated by the fact that we cut back

dairy production and now cannot meet our obligations to Britain;

we hung back on beef and face the prospect of failing to meet the

quotas we screamed for in the U.S.A.

'Its time Australians threw their old myths about a big

country out of the window arid realised the biggest thing about, us

in the past has been our heads'.
