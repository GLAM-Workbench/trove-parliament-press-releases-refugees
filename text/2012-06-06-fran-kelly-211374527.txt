TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH FRAN KELLY, RADIO NATIONAL, NEWS BREAKFAST - 6 JUNE  2012



E&OE ONLY



TOPICS: Mabo, Native Title, Family Violence, National Security



FRAN KELLY:         Today the Gillard Government will mark the twentieth anniversary of the high  court's historic Mabo Judgement by announcing some amendments to the native title laws.   Attorney-General Nicola Roxon will tell the annual Native Title Conference in Townsville that a  number of changes will be legislated to boost the good faith provisions in negotiations and to  make agreements more flexible and less technical.

This follows complaints, constant complaints really that the current regime has  become too difficult to navigate and is not giving indigenous Australians control over their  traditional lands.

Nicola Roxon, welcome to RN Breakfast.



NICOLA ROXON:    Good morning.



FRAN KELLY:         Attorney-General what's the key change you're making today to Native Title  laws.



NICOLA ROXON:    Well the key change, there's three of them.  But they all have a purpose of  making sure now that twenty years on when people have grown used to the Native Title system  and also been able to identify some of its problems, that we can fix those problems and that we  can give parties, indigenous Australians in particular the ability to be able to negotiate to a final  outcome more of their rights under this regime.

And of course we've seen the maturing of the respondents to negotiate with them, the states and  territories, miners, a range of other parties who really want to be able to now negotiate outcomes  and the system is a little bit too difficult to allow that, even where there is good agreement  between all of the parties.



FRAN KELLY:         Too difficult and too slow that's the constant criticism.  Les Malezer who heads  the Australian Congress of Australia's First Peoples says the Native Title laws are an impediment to  decent outcomes that they've become too complex and are taking too long to negotiate  sometimes up to fifteen years.  How will the changes you announce today speed things up?



NICOLA ROXON:    Well you've got to look at it as a combination because the changes we're  announcing today are an important other stage of what we have already been doing over the last  couple of years and indeed what we announced in the budget.  So when Minister McClelland was  the Attorney-General he made some changes that have had a very significant impact in speeding  up the determinations in the court.

We made changes in the budget to move the Native Title Tribunal back into the federal court,  again with an eye to how quickly those matters can be settled.  But what we're also doing today is  making sure that parties are required to negotiate in good faith.



FRAN KELLY:         What does that mean Minister?



NICOLA ROXON:    What it means in that at the moment there are some cases where people  simply wait the course of time and the court will let's say alright well you know because six  months or eight months or twelve months down the track you haven't reached an agreement we'll  now take that matter to court and determine it.  We want people to genuinely negotiate an  outcome and that genuinely negotiated outcome which won't be possible in every situation, will  mean that some matters will be resolved much quicker and won't need to go to the courts. So it's  a mix, looking from lots of different directions because every claim is different.  But this is putting  some teeth into an area where there has been a complaint that people might just let the clock tick  rather than trying to bring these matters to a resolution.  Another example is...



FRAN KELLY:         Which suggests bad faith on behalf of some of those respondents you talked  about earlier, state governments or miners or other interests.



NICOLA ROXON:    Well and there is a mix.  I think there's a maturing and an engagement from  many groups who've now got used to Native Title and do negotiate good agreements and can do

them quickly and others who really don't regard that as part of what they should do in their daily  working life.  And we need them to understand that the Government expects proper negotiation  with all parties. And the same applies for applicants.  They also need to be able to negotiate in  good faith.



FRAN KELLY:         Okay.  Minister your changes ignore the big push for a reversal of the onus of  proof.  Currently it's up to traditional owners to prove that they've got a continuous association  with the land.  Reversing that would mean the Native Title objectors would have to prove a  continuous attachment no longer exists. Now Aboriginal people and some of the architects of the  Native Title laws have called for this for some time.  Why haven't you made that change?



NICOLA ROXON:    Well these other changes are the ones that we're giving priority to.  I don't think  there's been sufficient discussion or agreement about how reversing the onus would work.  But I  do acknowledge that many people would like to take that further step.  That's not something that  the Government is prepared to do at this stage. And we think that these changes, one of them  that we haven't discussed yet links into this which is that parties can agree to, that ignore the  historical extinguishment of rights.  So at the moment the system prevents parties being able to  agree to do that.  So we're taking some steps along this path but we don't believe that now is the  time to try to progress that reversing of the onus. I think technical work needs to be done, I don't  think the parliament would support it.  And the Government is determined to focus on  incremental but significant changes that can improve the Native Title Act.



FRAN KELLY:         You're listening to RN Breakfast.  Our guest this morning is Attorney-General  Nicola Roxon.  Minister if we can switch to family law now because tomorrow the definition of  domestic violence in the Family Law Court will be expanded to include derogatory taunts, stalking,  withholding money and harming the family pet.  Why are these changes needed?



NICOLA ROXON:    We wanted to make very clear that the interest of the child and the safety of  the child do have to be the top consideration at all times for parents and for the courts.  And it  was unclear with our laws as they stood whether or not for example a child witnessing violence  between parents would count as a child experiencing violence, whereas of course we know that  that can have very serious impacts and long-term  damage to a child. So these definitions make  clearer that what is unacceptable behaviour in a family relationship can be taken account of by the  court when they're determining whether a parent should have ongoing access to a child.



FRAN KELLY:         Some are concerned that these new definitions will tip the balance away from  shared parenting which is at the centre of Family Court disputes at the moment or resolutions.   The Lone Fathers Association warns courts will be too quick to believe allegations of abuse.



NICOLA ROXON:    Well I have more faith in the courts in being able to look at factual situations  sensibly but I don't want to be in a position where there might be repeated violence against one  parent in full view of what might be a small child, terrified, over a long period of time and an  argument being put that that shouldn't be taken into account.  That defies common sense.  Stalking, you know a range of very exploitative behaviours, denying one partner access to their  family or friends.  These sorts of things ought to be taken account of.  We support, in a perfect  world every child should have a good strong relationship with their mother and father.  But in a  less than perfect world we want to make sure that the safety of the child is the top consideration.  And if you are violent or abusive in a family relationship you are putting at jeopardy your  relationship with your child.



FRAN KELLY:         Minister as Attorney-General you also have oversight of ASIO.  Have you asked  the Director-General of ASIO David Irvine about the security checks ASIO performed on Captain  Emad the accused people smuggler as it was revealed on Four Corners this week, and his six  agents, all of whom apparently were processed on Christmas Island?



NICOLA ROXON:    Well I've been in Townsville for the last few days including when this story  broke.  Our agencies of course are always looking at any sort of  material that comes to light.  I  think that my colleagues both Minister Bowen and Minister Clare have made some detailed  comments particularly about the AFP process.  So I'm just not in the right place to be able to  answer that question in detail but certainly our agencies and ASIO in particular, does undertake  very thorough examination of anybody who is seeking to be settled permanently in Australia.



FRAN KELLY:         And yet Bob Brown said yesterday that...



NICOLA ROXON:    And we are concerned by these reports.



FRAN KELLY:         Bob Brown said yesterday ASIO has let people, quote, with criminal intent into  the Australian community.  It needs to answer why.  Will you be looking for these answers?



NICOLA ROXON:    Certainly we always want to review our processes but I do highlight that Mr  Brown and others are the very same people who accuse ASIO of behaving inappropriately when  we have people who do have adverse findings made against them held in detention.  They can't  have it both ways.  The Government needs to be able to protect our national security, we take  that very seriously. People are denied permanent visas to settle in Australia where that material is

available about people.  But I really want a bit of consistency in the debate that the very same  people who criticise the Government for keeping people in detention who have been found to be  a security risk, even if they have also been found to be entitled to the protection of the Refugee  Convention, can't have it both ways.



FRAN KELLY:         Nicola Roxon thank you very much for joining us.



NICOLA ROXON:    Thank you.
