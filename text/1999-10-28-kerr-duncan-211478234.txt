Another boatpeople landing -

Ruddock and Vanstone need to explore Coastguard 
proposal

Â

“It is time the Government examined the option of a n Australian 
Coastguard to prevent any further boatpeople landings,” the Shadow 
Justice and Customs Minister Duncan Kerr said today.

Â

“The Government admitted yesterday that two more 
boats carrying 143 illegal immigrants landed on Ashmore Reef off the 
North-West Coast of WA last week. A further 25 people were found on 
Sunday on the North-West Kimberly Coast.

Â

“Over the past four months, there have been almost 
1000 boat people. This is in contrast to 20 for the same period last 
year.

Â

“Australia has 11 million square kilometres of ocean 
to monitor. But the fact remains that we haven’t got the ‘cop on 
the beat’ with proper resources and proper coordination to do the 
task the Australian public expects.

Â

“Australia has this year had a record number of 
boat people with 58 boats carrying around 1700 people, compared with 
13 boats and 157 people in 1997/98.

Â

“This is exactly the sort of outcome we expect from 
the Government’s ad hoc approach to border protection.

Â

“There is no one agency with overall responsibility 
for our maritime jurisdiction.

Â

“Labor says it is time for the Government to examine 
the option of an integrated strategy and an Australian Coastguard.”
