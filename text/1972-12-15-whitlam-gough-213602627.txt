Â£ CONTRIBUTIONS TO UNITED NATION'S FUNDS FOR SOUTHERN AFRICA -V4

The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr E.G. Whitlam, today announced

that Australia will contribute $10,000 to the United Nations Educational

and Training Programme for Southern Africa, and $5Â»000 each to the United

Nations Trust Fund for South Africa and the United Nations Fund for Namibia.

Mr Whitlam said this was the first time Australia had contributed

to these Funds, which were established to assist the educational development

and other aspirations of the people of Southern Africa.

Mr Whitlam said he had long felt that Australia should assist the

people of Southern Africa by taking an active role in United Nations activities

undertaken on their behalf and by making financial contributions to the Funds

established for this purpose.

Mr Whitlam said that Australia would be one of the first countries

to make a contribution to the United Nations Fund for Namibia, which was

established in December 1970. This Fund was established to support a

programme designed to help Namibians prepare for independence.

The United Nations Trust Fund for South Africa was established in

December 1965. Grants made by the Fund are used to provide legal assistance

to persons prosecuted under the discriminatory legislation of South Africa,

relief and education to such persons and their dependents and relief for

refugees from South Africa. The United Nations Educational and Training

Programme for Southern Africa was established in December 1967Â·
