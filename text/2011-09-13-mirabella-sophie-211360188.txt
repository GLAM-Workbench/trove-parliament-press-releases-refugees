E&OE……………………….……………………………………………………………

TONY ABBOTT:

It’s great to be here at Universal Trusses. I want to thank the Potter family for making me and Sophie  Mirabella, the Industry Shadow Minister, so welcome. This is typical of the thousands of small and medium  sized businesses right around Australia which is going to be impacted by the carbon tax. Every year this  business spends about $200,000 on transport, that’s going to go up and up and up under the carbon tax.  Every year this business spends $45,000 on power, that’s going to go up and up and up under the carbon tax.  If we want to keep a manufacturing industry in Australia we will drop this toxic tax which falls on  Australian manufacturers but won’t fall on their overseas rivals.

Now, while the Prime Minister is in the parliament trying to ram through the parliament a toxic tax for  which she has no mandate, I am talking to the workers who are going to be impacted by this tax and the  message loud and clear from the workers of Australia is drop this toxic tax. I say that if there is one thing  that government can do now to take the pressure off manufacturing industry it’s to announce that the carbon  tax, the one sided carbon tax that will hit our industries but not industries overseas, drop the toxic tax. I say  to Labor members of parliament: please consider the jobs of the workers in your electorates. Think of the  manufacturing industries in your electorates; and when you are casting your vote on the carbon tax don’t  think of a floundering Prime Minister and her political interests, think of the economic interests, the  employment interests of the workers in your electorate.

Just on one other subject just before I throw to Sophie and then to questions, I understand the Government  has just announced that there will be a media inquiry. This is yet another example of the Government being  dictated to by Bob Brown and the Greens. There is no evidence of any significant new problems with the  media in Australia. This looks like a naked attempt to intimidate the media. This is a Government which  blames everyone but itself for its problems. It’s not the coverage which is causing this Government  problems, it’s the performance which is causing this Government’s problems and I think that every  Australian needs to understand that this is an arrogant, bullying Government and this is the latest evidence of  that.

SOPHIE MIRABELLA:

It’s great to be here at an innovative family-friendly workplace, a local business employing young local  people, servicing the local community, using Australian timber and being very good and efficient at what  they do. What they don’t need is for their costs to go up to make housing more expensive, to make local  schools more expensive, the construction of local shops more expensive because the Government needed to  keep the Greens happy and introduce a carbon tax. We’ve also seen last week that the timber industry has  initiated an anti-dumping application against dumped structural timber and it’s the sort of action that would  directly benefit this business here that does use Australian timber.

We’re here because we believe in innovation, we believe in Australian family-run businesses and we believe  in governments reducing the costs of making things in Australia, of doing business here in Australia and it’s  heartening to see a positive attitude from the staff here. We have asked the Government to come along with  us to make a first step in helping local business, a very easy first step to abandon the carbon tax. There is  still time because the viability of so many family run businesses in the manufacturing sector do rely on  remaining competitive and that means they can’t absorb, they can’t afford additional costs with the carbon  tax.

TONY ABBOTT:

Ok, any questions?

QUESTION:

Will you support the Government changes to the Migration Act?

TONY ABBOTT:

We haven’t seen any Government changes and when they show us their changes they will go through the  normal processes of our party, the Shadow Cabinet processes, the party room processes. Now, I want to  make it very clear though that we support offshore processing, we don’t support offshore dumping. Nauru  and Manus are offshore processing; Malaysia is offshore dumping. Malaysia, as I have been making clear,  as my senior colleagues have been making clear for a long time now, it’s very bad policy. The five for one  people swap is not something that a sensible government would have agreed to. Sending people to a country  where they could be caned is not something that a decent government would have agreed to, particularly  when there is a viable alternative. Malaysia is already a proven policy failure. 1,000 illegal arrivals have  taken place since Malaysia was first announced, 400 boat people have come since the deal was signed.  Nauru is a proven success and I call on the Government, I call on the Prime Minister to swallow her pride, to  drop her stubborn insistence on anywhere but Nauru and even at this late hour pick up the phone to the  President of Nauru.

QUESTION:

The Coalition have criticised the Government for the brevity of the carbon tax debate. How will you go  about trying to get some extra time?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, in the end we are in the hands of the independents and we will be talking to them about the importance  of subjecting this legislation to proper parliamentary scrutiny. Now as you know we think that this is bad  legislation that the Prime Minister is ramming through a parliament that has no mandate for it. This is a bad  tax based on a lie. That’s been our point all along and that will continue to be our point. We think that the  parliament should not be considering this without the Prime Minister seeking a mandate by taking it to the  people at an election but we do think that all fair-minded members of parliament, regardless of their view on

the merits of a carbon tax, ought to want to see the thing subjected to full scrutiny. This is the most complex  policy change in our history, designed to change the way every Australian lives and works. It’s being rushed  through the parliament by the most incompetent government in our history. This is accident-prone  legislation from an accident-prone government. The best way to try to ensure that there are as few accidents  as possible is to have proper parliamentary scrutiny and as things stand there is going to be less than one  minute per member per bill of scrutiny of this legislation.

QUESTION:

Tony, the Government says that it still has to decide the terms of reference of the media inquiry. Is there  anything that you want to see in it?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I just think there’s no need for a media inquiry. I mean, this is a naked attempt to intimidate the media  and I say it again: the problems of this Government are not the fault of the media, the problems of this  Government are its own fault. It’s not bad coverage that’s killing this Government, it’s poor performance  which is killing this Government.

QUESTION:

They’re saying that it won’t be a witch hunt against its critics such as News Limited. Do you believe them?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, this is the Prime Minister who said six days before the last election, “there will be no carbon tax under  the government I lead.” This is the Prime Minister who said that boat people would not be sent to countries  that hadn’t signed the UN convention. You can’t believe anything this Prime Minister or this Government  says.

QUESTION:

Just on the UN convention, will you require in any legislation that is put before you when you see it that  there be a rider in that legislation that requires if people are sent offshore it must be to a country that has  signed the UN convention?

TONY ABBOTT:

David, I’m just not going to pre-empt our response to the Government’s legislation. Let’s wait and see the  Government’s legislation. Then it will go through our proper processes and then we will announce a detailed  response.

QUESTION:

Do you accept the Immigration Department’s advice that Nauru won’t really work anymore, that the game  has changed?

TONY ABBOTT:

I would have a lot more confidence if the Government would provide us with access to the Immigration  Department’s advice before the High Court case. I would have a lot more confidence if the Government  would provide us with access to the Immigration Department’s advice prior to it scrapping the Pacific  Solution. Now we know, we know that the Government was told officially back in 2008 that scrapping the  Pacific Solution would put the people smugglers back in business. It’s a bit rich for the Government to come

along now and say you must always follow every last detail of official advice, when this is a government  which has neglected official advice. Where official advice has possibly been wrong? We have to make our  own call on this and that’s what we’re doing.

QUESTION:

Will you submit the election policies to the Parliamentary Budget Office?

TONY ABBOTT:

If the Parliamentary Budget Office is the kind of institution that it should be; that treats proposals from  members of parliament in confidence and provides frank and fearless confidential advice, yes, but that’s not  the Parliamentary Budget Office that we look like getting from this Government.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, do you still have any hope that you’ll have some way of stopping the carbon tax?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think that the more people understand about the carbon tax the less they like it. The message is coming  through in a gathering crescendo from the Australian public: this is a bad tax based on a lie. This is a toxic  tax from a government with the Midas touch in reverse. This is a tax that we just don’t need. It is a cost of  living-killing, jobs-destroying new tax. Now, I think that message is coming through loud and clear from the  Australian people. The only person who is deaf to that message is the Prime Minister, but her members of  parliament aren’t quite as deaf as she is. Let’s see what happens over the next few weeks.
