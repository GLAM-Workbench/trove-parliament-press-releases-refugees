TONY ABBOTT:

It’s terrific to be here. I want to thank KPMG for hosting Arthur Sinodinos, Kelly O'Dwyer, David Bushby and myself for this

important policy launch. This is yet another one of our positive policies for the betterment of our country. We had our broadband  policy, we had our workplace relations policy, we had our Northern Australia policy, now this very important policy to reduce red

tape, to boost productivity and to strengthen the economy. Australian businesses are suffocating under an absolute mountain of  red tape and green tape. It's our job to make it easier for them. We will make it easier for them and what that means is more

prosperity and more jobs for the Australian public.

If we can reduce the burdens on business, we make it easier for them to employ, we make it easier for them to pay the kind of  wages that the Australian public are entitled to expect. That's our job, to make it easier for the businesses of Australia to get on

with their business of producing wealth and producing employment for the Australian people. I want to thank and congratulate  Arthur Sinodinos, Kelly and David for the outstanding work they have done. What I've really liked about the work they have done,

is that it is based on solid consultation with the businesses and the organisations of our country which are groaning under the red  tape burden. We have got to reduce it, we will reduce it. Thanks to the work that Arthur and Kelly and David have done, we have

the road map forward.

ARTHUR SINODINOS:

Thanks very much, Tony. This is really a policy which addresses one of the central issues of the coming campaign which is Kevin  Rudd thinks he can control everything. He thinks he can put government at the centre of the economy. What we are saying is that

under his regime and under Julia Gillard that followed him, we have had 21,000 extra regulations in Australia and less than five  per cent have been taken off. So as Tony says, there has been a lot more regulation. A lot of it has been done without adequate

notice or consultation. A lot of it has been done without the costs and benefits being adequately looked at. We have to get rid of  this sort of policy uncertainty and instability. Kevin just can't change policy every day because he wants to dominate the media

cycle. We want policy and stability. We’re going to engage the stakeholders, consumers, business, non for profits in actually  advising government on an ongoing basis on where there are regulations, where there is excessive red tape that we can reduce.

This is all about making a stronger economy. It will create more jobs. We have had consultations with about 180 organisations  around the country - 100 submissions. We have tried to reflect that in the discussion paper that’s gone out, but importantly we

want to change this idea that Canberra knows best by engaging the rest of the community, the ones who have to respond to the  burden of regulation.

I want to thank Tony for the opportunity to do this. Some of these people say is just about process, but process is important if you

want to avoid stupid outcomes. If we had more process during the global financial crisis, we wouldn't have some of the rushed  and botched jobs that we saw then. It is important that we get on with having a government that provides certainty and stability.

Everybody knows what they stand for and before major policies are introduced, we have adequate consultation with those who  are affected. Thanks very much Tony.

TONY ABBOTT:

Thank you so much Arthur, do we have any questions?

QUESTION:

Are there specific regulations you can name that you are looking to get rid of?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well obviously, just to give you one example, the abolition of the carbon tax will remove thousands of pages of legislation and  regulation and at least three major bureaucracies. That is a very, very significant specific example that I can give you. We are also

in this document committed to extending the length for instance of National Health and Medical Research council grants to five  years. That means that you only have to go through the paperwork once every five years rather than one every three years or

more frequently. The other really key initiative here which I really want to stress, is a one stop shop for environmental approvals.  Business should not have to run the gauntlet twice. Yes, we do expect high environmental standards but you shouldn't have to run

the gauntlet twice. Once you have demonstrated to one set of officials that you are going to meet high environmental standards  that should be enough.

QUESTION:

This one stop shop for the environmental approval, is that handing more environmental powers to the states then?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well it’s ensuring that we have a better regulatory system. The states will administer things like the Commonwealth EPBC Act on

our behalf. So the same high standards but a lot less bureaucracy, a lot less time consuming bureaucracy in terms of compliance.

QUESTION:

This deregulation unit, I think you’re calling it, within the Prime Minister’s department, what would they actually be doing? How  many people would work there?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well we aren’t going to be adding to the numbers in the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet. In fact, over time, we are as

you know, going to reduce the numbers on the Commonwealth public sector payroll by 12,000 because we need government  which is efficient and effective rather than government that is merely big but nevertheless this unit will be in the Department of

Prime Minister and Cabinet. It’s to ensure that we have a deregulatory focus at the heart of government and as Arthur has just  mentioned, the Office of Best Regulatory Practice will come across as part of this deregulation unit from Finance to PM&C.

QUESTION:

Are you essentially linking public servants’ pay to how much red tape they reduce?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well as you know, senior public servants these days are eligible for bonuses and one of the KPIs on which those bonuses will be

determined will be the success of senior public servants at actually meeting their red tape cost reduction targets. Some of you  might be familiar with a programme that was put in place some years ago in Victoria which is generally regarded by bodies like

ACCI and the BCA as best practice in deregulation. Every departmental head, every agency chief is required to deliver a quantum  of savings every year and we’ve seen in Victoria in the last couple of years for instance $10 million worth of court savings by no

longer insisting on original documents for the various court lodgement processes and this is typical of the kind of thing that can be  achieved when you give the public servants a focus on reducing regulation rather than endlessly adding to it.

QUESTION:

I think, did I hear correctly, you’re talking about $1 billion in red tape cost reductions per year?

TONY ABBOTT:

Per year. Per year. Look, the Productivity Commission estimated in 2011 that regulatory improvement could add at least $12

billion a year to our economy. It estimated last year that just addressing some key areas of federal/state regulatory reform would  produce $6 billion a year in savings. So the money is there to be made if you’ve got a government with the will to do it. The current

government is addicted to regulation. They’ve never seen a problem that they didn’t think a new tax or a new regulation or another  bureaucrat could solve. In our DNA is a reliance on businesses and community groups and organisations to do the right thing by

the people of Australia.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, just on asylum seekers, will a Coalition government be willing to take unilateral action on turning back the boats?

12/11/2013 http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/22487/20130903-0148/www.tonyabbott.c...

TONY ABBOTT:

We will stop the boats. We will stop the boats. Now, there are a range of measures that we will take to stop the boats. We will

reintroduce temporary protection visas to deny the people smugglers a product to sell.

We will have rigorous offshore processing centres at places like Nauru but, yes, we will be ready to turn boats around where it's

safe to do so. As a sovereign nation, we will do what is in Australia's national interests but obviously we will work in the closest  possible co-operation with our friends and neighbours. That's what the Howard Government did in the past. That's what an

incoming Coalition government will do now.

QUESTION:

Does that include deploying the SAS as required with the Tampa case which was raised by Scott Morrison this morning?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, I'm not going to get into operational matters. What we will ensure is that we are not played for mugs by the people  smugglers and their customers. We will not be played for mugs. We will not be taken for a ride as a nation and a people. I think

that the people smugglers must be laughing at the indecision and the hot air and the waffle that constantly comes from the  present government. Every day they make new announcements but none of these new announcements make any difference.

Kevin Rudd is rapidly demonstrating that this time, as last time, he talks a good game but he can never actually deliver.

QUESTION:

Are you advocating sending in troops when there is threats of self-harm on asylum seeker boats?

TONY ABBOTT:

Again, I’m just not going to get into operational matters - just to reiterate that a Coalition government will stop the boats and we  will start to make a difference from day one.

QUESTION:

Are you concerned that your policy might result in more harm to people given that the boat last week, the merchant vessel

stopped towing the boat back after the people onboard threatened to kill themselves? Are you concerned your policy result in  people hurting themselves?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, the Australian Government should not be expected to take responsibility for foolish actions by non-citizens. We just can't be

expected to take responsibility for that. And I make the fundamental point that the most compassionate thing to do is to stop the  boats. As long as the boats keep coming, the drownings will keep happening. And if you want to be a decent and compassionate

country, you should ensure that nothing is happening in your country which acts as an inducement to people to take foolish and  unnecessary risks.

QUESTION:

Are you happy to stop the boats but you’re not so worried about the people harming themselves? You are happy to stop the

drownings but not self-harm?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, obviously, people should not threaten acts of self-harm. People should not threaten acts of self-harm and the Australian  Government will not be blackmailed, should not be blackmailed by people who are threatening to do something that they should

never do.

QUESTION:

Why did Julie Bishop say there is no plan for unilateral action yet Scott Morrison said the Coalition would do just that? Is that  sending a mixed message?

TONY ABBOTT:

12/11/2013 http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/22487/20130903-0148/www.tonyabbott.c...

Well I don't accept the premise of your question. I really don’t accept the premise of your question. We will stop the boats. Kevin  Rudd hasn't been able to do it. Kevin Rudd is the best friend the people smugglers have ever had. John Howard destroyed the

people smugglers' business model. Kevin Rudd gave it back to them. Kevin Rudd gave it back to them. I mean at the moment,  you’ve got a Prime Minister who is trying to pretend that the last six years didn't happen. He is trying to pretend that any difficulties

were all the fault of the person who he was plotting against for three years and three days. All of the problems that Julia Gillard  failed to fix, whether it be the border protection problem, the deficit problem, the climate change problem, the mining tax problem,

these were all problems that she inherited from Kevin Rudd and the best thing you can do if you want to clean up the Labor Party,  if you want to send the strongest possible message to politicians that governments have got to be competent and trustworthy, is

give the Labor Party time out in Opposition.

QUESTION:

Do you think the Prime Minister admitted liability over the pink batts scandal and should the families of victims be compensated?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think that the families and victims are entitled to a meeting with the Prime Minister, if that's what they want. I think they are  certainly entitled to pursue their rights at law but most of all, they are entitled to a full explanation and full disclosure from this

Prime Minister. On at least ten separate occasions Prime Minister Rudd was explicitly warned about the dangers involved in this  programme. He should release all of the emails and all of the correspondence he received, including in particular the four letters

he received on this subject from Minister Garrett.

QUESTION:

Did you claim travel expenses on your book tour?

TONY ABBOTT:

I did not.

QUESTION:

You said that Mr Rudd, talks of games, again challenged you to a debate at the Press Club this Thursday and said you should  man up and turn up. What is your response to that?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, Mr Rudd needs to decide, is he governing or is he campaigning? Because he can't be doing both. If he is governing, recall

the Parliament and he and I will debate every day. If he is campaigning name the date, end the suspense, tell us when the  election will be and then there will be a programme of election debates.

QUESTION:

So, you are happy for him to stand there and debate with a metaphorical empty chair?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, I think it would be very good. I challenge Mr Rudd to turn up and tell the Australian people exactly what was wrong with Julia

Gillard's Government and exactly what he will change now, because at the moment there's no change. Same old Labor, same old  government, same old Kevin.

QUESTION:

He says that you are the boxing blue in one corner and he is the nerdy kid with the glasses in the library in the other. Do you think

that’s a pretty fair assessment?

TONY ABBOTT:

I'm not going apply pejorative tags to people, I am just going to say that it's not all about Kevin. It really is not all about Kevin. I  know how bad he felt for three long years and three long days about the treatment that was metered out to him by Julia Gillard

and the faceless men of Sussex Street. He is momentarily grateful to the faceless men for putting him back but it's not about you,  Kevin. It's about the Australian people and I say to the Australian people, if there is a change of government, my colleagues and I

will devote our lives to your service, not to our own.

QUESTION:

What do you think about an October election, will that suit you?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well I think that the Government should have sought a mandate for its carbon tax the instant it resolved on that course. So, this

Government should have gone to the people the instant it decided that it could no longer maintain the solemn commitments that  were made to the people prior to the last election, whether it be the no carbon tax commitment, whether it be the surplus

commitment, as soon as the Government realised that it was incapable of keeping its solemn commitments, it should have gone  back to the people. I think the public are heartily sick of a hung Parliament. I think they are heartily sick of minority Government. I

think they are heartily sick of the circus inside the Caucus and the problem is what this Government is now asking for is a reward  for the incompetence and the untrustworthiness of the last three years. I say to the Australian people, whenever the election is,

the only way to clean up this mess is to give Labor time out in Opposition.
