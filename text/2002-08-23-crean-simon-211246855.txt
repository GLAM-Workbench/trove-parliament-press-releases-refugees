LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION

STATEMENT BY THE LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION THE HON SIMON CREAN MP

Shadow Ministry

I have today taken the opportunity of the vacancy in the Shadow Ministry to give greater strength to the policy areas Labor has identified as priorities for all Australians.

I have promoted Mark Latham to Shadow Cabinet, and added to his portfolio responsibilities of Economic Ownership, Housing and Urban Development the additional responsibility for Community Security.

This new portfolio builds on the work Mark has done in developing policies to give all Australians the opportunity to get ahead, own their own home and achieve financial security with additional responsibility for community safety.

Mark will now be in charge of Labor’s plan to bring national leadership in the fight to protect our communities against crime through policies such as Labor’s Community Safety Zones. Labor believes community security extends to protecting our borders and Mark will also be given responsibility for Labor’s Coastguard policy.

I am also delighted to announce the appointment of Annette Ellis as Labor’s new Shadow Minister for Ageing and Seniors, and Minister Assisting on Disabilities.

Annette’s portfolio recognises her devotion to helping people with disabilities and her desire to work in the area of social policy.

The link between trade, industry and innovation is vital to Australia’s future economic development, and I have today also taken the opportunity to further highlight this policy priority for Labor by giving Dr Craig Emerson specific responsibility for Trade, in addition to his existing responsibilities for industry and innovation.

Other changes I am announcing today will strengthen Labor’s representation in a number of other key areas of concern to all Australians.

Another policy priority for Labor is improving the job prospects of unemployed Australians through better job skills and training and Anthony Albanese will now take a key role in this area as Shadow Minister for Employment Services and Training.

Economist David Cox, former senior private secretary to Finance Minister Peter Walsh in the 1980s and principal advisor to Treasurer Ralph Willis in the 1990s will be using his economic and financial skills as Labor’s Assistant Treasury spokesman.

Labor sees regional development as a vital part of our nation’s future and Tourism’s key role in the regions will be highlighted by the move of Tourism to the Regional Development Portfolio. Specific responsibility for Tourism will now be taken up by Gavan O’Connor in addition to his duties as Shadow Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government.

I am also delighted to announce the promotion of Senator Michael Forshaw to the position of Parliamentary Secretary for Family and Community Services, the role previously held by Annette Ellis.

The changes I have announced today further highlight Labor’s priorities and reflect my determination to develop policies that meet the needs of all Australians.
