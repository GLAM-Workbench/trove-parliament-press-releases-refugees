M E W S R E L E A S E  FROM THE MINISTER FOR

IEA26/7

LEBANESE MIGRATION

The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs,

Mr Il.J.R. MacKellar, said that the special arrangements to

process applications by Lebanese people to migrate to  Australia were now operating.

The position in Beirut did not allow the return of

the Australian Embassy staff but migration action in the area

was being co-ordinated from Athens.  An Australian immigration

officer was now located in Damascus and action had been taken

to strengthen the Immigration Office in Cyprus. Other Australian

Offices in the area available to handle migration applications

were in Ankara, Tel Aviv and Cairo. Approval has adready been

given in a number of cases. An on the spot assessment was to

be made in Amman in Jordan to see whether special action was

needed to deal with immigration applicants there.

|  |  Mr MacKellar said that these arrangements were the most

elaborate undertaken by any country for receiving immigrants  from the Lebanon. Persons who were eligible to migrate to

Australia were having applications processed promptly and with

|the minimum of inconvenience to them. In some cases it had i  :Â· . Ã¢ÂÂ

been decided to waive the normal controls. This applied where

persons were able to identify themselves as the spouses,

dependent children or aged and dependent parents of Australian

residents but did not have travel documents. While every effort

was made to conduct medical examinations on the spot, if that

was not possible he was permitting entry to Australia on the

understanding that the persons concerned would be medically

checked on arrival.

,  As announced earlier this year Lebanese visitors in

iAustralia were being granted extensions to enable them, to stay

in Australia for the duration of the emergency iri the Lebanon.

.  Mr MacKellar said that he shared the earnest hopes

of Lebanese residents of Australia that lasting peace would

be restored in the Lebanon. He reaffirmed his commitment to

send a task force of immigration officers to Beirut to

process migrant applications there as soon as the situation

allowed. .

In the meantime he guaranteed that every migrant applicant

would have his or her case considered sympathetically and  without delay in accordance with the criteria for migrant

entry to Australia.
