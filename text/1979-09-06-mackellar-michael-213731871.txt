IMMIGRATION OFFICE TO OPEN IN ALBURY-WODONGA

The Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs

will open an Albury-Wodonga Area office from 10 September until

Street, Wodonga,  Ph. (060) 243222, will serve a large area

including Wagga, Â·  Corowa,  Wangaratta and Benalla.

Office hours will be from 8.45 am to 5.06 pm from

Monday to Friday.

The location of an office in Wodonga is an experiment

but a decision on its future will be made following experience

with the community and assessments of the work-load.

Ms Elaine Moloney, a highly experienced officer of

the Department will be in charge of the office. She has had

overseas postings to New York, Kuala Lumpur, Rangoon and

Sri Lanka.

The decision to open an office followed a visit to

Albury-Wodonga by the Galbally Task Force which considered there

should be an opportunity for closer involvement between the

Department and the community.

The new office will attend to matters affecting

migrants and people involved in their settlement in Albury-

Wodonga area, and provide information on migrant sponsorship;

extension of visitor visas;  refugee settlement; adult migrant '

education and English classes;  and change of status applications.
