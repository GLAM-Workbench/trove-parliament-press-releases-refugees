KATHRYN ROBINSON, PRESENTER: YouÃ¢ÂÂre watching Meet the Press. Well,  within the first few days of May, over 600 asylum seekers arrived in Australian  waters, and that comes after two consecutive record months of arrivals in March and  April. The number of asylum seekers risking their lives at sea show no sign of  abating, and as the September election draws near, it will be one of the key issues for  many voters. Joining me on the panel to look at this is Network TenÃ¢ÂÂs Political Editor  Hugh Riminton and Lauren Wilson, Political Reporter with Ã¢ÂÂThe AustralianÃ¢ÂÂ  newspaper. Good morning to you both.

LAUREN WILSON: Morning.

HUGH RIMINTON: Morning.

KATHRYN ROBINSON: And our guest today is Shadow Immigration Minister,  Scott Morrison. Thank you very much for joining us this morning.

SCOTT MORRISON: Morning. My pleasure to be here with you.

KATHRYN ROBINSON: 645 illegal arrivals, five boats, three days - huge numbers.  What do you put it down to?

SCOTT MORRISON: The Government's border protection failures over many, many  years, which compound now to the point where it's reported today over 3,000 children  have arrived this year - up 1,000 from last year, up 1,000 from the year before that.  And we have more children back in more formal detention today than we did before  Chris Bowen said he was going to get them all out. I mean, that's what happens when  you don't fix the problem. People just keep coming, and the cost and the chaos and the  tragedy just gets worse and worse.

LAUREN WILSON: Are you 100% confident that your Howard Government policies  - TPVs, turning back the boats, using offshore processing - will stop the boats, and if  so, how long is it going to take?

SCOTT MORRISON: Well, in addition to the measures which youÃ¢ÂÂve mentioned  there - of course we're confident - and in addition to that we need a regional  deterrence framework, which IÃ¢ÂÂve been talking about now for some years. We need  the regional arrangements to focus on deterrents, not acting as a magnet, which I  believe is what the Government has taken the regional framework the direction they  have taken it in. I've been making that case for some time. So the partnerships we  have with other countries in the region are about deterring people from coming into  the region before they even get on a vessel. So, you have got to do all the things on  your own border - youÃ¢ÂÂve got to have the physical presence of deterrence on our sea  border, which is why turn-backs, where it's safe to do so, are so important - and then  working all the way up the chain, working that deterrence intelligence framework to  disrupt. So yes, I am confident. As Tony has said, as I have said - we will do that in  our first term, and we hope to do it as soon as possible.

LAUREN WILSON: So if you havenÃ¢ÂÂt done it - if you win Government, if you  haven't done it within a year, will you consider that a failure?



SCOTT MORRISON: Well, the ultimate test for these things comes, if we're elected,  at the subsequent election, and people will have the opportunity to look at our record  and to see how we've performed, if weÃ¢ÂÂre elected in September. And that's the  ultimate test which every potential government puts itself to.

HUGH RIMINTON: At the current rate of arrivals, Nauru and Manus Island would be  completely swamped within about three weeks. Does that indicate that those offshore  options are not going to be a deterrent on their own?

SCOTT MORRISON: Well, we've never said they are a deterrent on their own, and  that's always been our point. The Government cherry-picks offshore processing,  dragged kicking and screaming to that, but ignores turn-backs, where itÃ¢ÂÂs safe to do  so. I mean, the Government-

HUGH RIMINTON: Turn-backs are the only key - really bold difference that youÃ¢ÂÂve  got? TPVs are not a great deal different to what the GovernmentÃ¢ÂÂs put out-

SCOTT MORRISON: No, no, I would strongly disagree. Under the GovernmentÃ¢ÂÂs  policy you get a permanent visa if you come by boat, if you are found to be a refugee,  and a pathway to citizenship. Temporary Protection Visas do not prolong-

HUGH RIMINTON: After a long wait.

SCOTT MORRISON: Ah, well, no. How long's the wait? You tell me. Once they-

HUGH RIMINTON: Well, I mean we donÃ¢ÂÂt know yet, but they're saying five years.  IsnÃ¢ÂÂt that-

SCOTT MORRISON: Once they get assessed - once - well, the Government has been  very unclear about this, but once you get an assessment, and the visa you get under  the Government scheme is a permanent visa, that's not what you will get under a  Coalition Government. The only option is a temporary visa which has no access to  family reunion; no ability to leave the country and come back again as the current  arrangements provide for. But the other one is what I said before - and that is the  regional deterrence framework; a regional program focussed on deterring, on policing,  on working with joint patrols - all of these things. YouÃ¢ÂÂve got to do it all together.  And if you don't do it all together, well, youÃ¢ÂÂll get what this Government is giving  you.

HUGH RIMINTON: Why donÃ¢ÂÂt you cut the Gordian knot on this, and simply revoke  Australia's signature on the Refugee Convention? It is that which provides the  promise of refugee protection to people who come here and seek our support from  persecution. If we're not signatories, that simply is taken off the table, isnÃ¢ÂÂt it?

SCOTT MORRISON: Well, I think what that suggests, though, is that there is none of  these arrangements embedded already in Australian law. I mean, what's in the  Convention is now in Australia's domestic law and right throughout the Migration Act  and many other provisions. In addition to that, international law, particularly on the  issue of non-refoulement, also pretty much applies to countries that aren't signatories

generally as well. So the embedded nature of this whole environment is both within  international and Australian law. And I know many suggest that if you did that, that  that - that may contribute. But John Howard stopped the boats without having to  withdraw from the Refugee Convention, and we believe we can as well.

KATHRYN ROBINSON: Drawing your attention just quickly to Malaysia - there  could be a change of government there sometime soon - is there any idea that a  change in government there would make the Coalition look at the Malaysia Solution  again?

SCOTT MORRISON: No, we've never been believers in the Malaysia Solution for a  number of reasons. First of all, getting binding legal protections for people being sent  there is not possible. Chris Bowen said that to me bluntly over a year ago, well before  this minister came into being, and so on. They've always said legally binding  protections for Malaysia is not on the cards - on the table for Malaysia. Secondly, the  800 cap is overwhelmed in a week now. And there has been no willingness to look at  a change to that, both from the Malaysian government's perspective, as relayed to us  by our Government, as well as by the Government itself. And the Houston Panel has  also ruled it out in its current form, and the Government has made no changes  consistent with what the Houston Panel has recommended. So today the Malaysian  people-swap is just bandied about by the Prime Minister as an excuse to sit there and  do absolutely nothing.

LAUREN WILSON: The Minister for Immigration has been in Sri Lanka. What's  your assessment at the moment about human rights in Sri Lanka?

SCOTT MORRISON: Well things have moved on since the end of the war, some  years ago as you know. I was there with Julie Bishop and Michael Keenan earlier this  year, and we had extensive discussions with people, particularly with the Tamil  community, who took us around on our own private tour, with no government  involvement, over the first couple of days. We met people in displaced persons  camps, and met with their authorities and everyone to understand the situation. Now,  one thing we learned, very importantly there, was the relationship with India, and  what the UNHCR's High Commissioner for Refugees had said about the good work  India had done in providing a safe-

HUGH RIMINTON: What is your assessment? The question is, what is your  assessment of human rights in Sri Lanka?

SCOTT MORRISON: Well, I think the situation has improved dramatically. That's  not to say that things still do not occur, and cannot still occur, but my point is this:  why would you come all the way on a boat to Australia, over 3,000km, when 30km  away in India there is safe haven and has been for a long time? So the issue is about  why someone would decide to get on that boat to come to Australia, as opposed if  they are fleeing for their lives, than a safer, closer, and proven option, is already  available. And that's - that was our assessment when we were there. But people  should be returned to Sri Lanka. This Government has returned about one in six this  year. And our view has always been in co-operation with the Sri Lankan government  to arrange for people, all who would seek to come, to be returned, and do that through  the non-government authorities that can assist with people's settlement back into Sri

Lanka, as has been the case out of India. I mean, thousands of people have been  resettled back out of India into Sri Lanka, and that process has gone very well.

KATHRYN ROBINSON: Alright, we may need to take a very quick break. But  coming up on Meet The Press - we look at the Liberals' latest attack ad with Shadow  Minister, Scott Morrison.

KATHRYN ROBINSON, PRESENTER: Welcome back to Meet The Press. Our  guest today is Shadow Immigration Minister, Scott Morrison. The Liberal Party is  planning a Sunday roast for the Labor Party, with the launch of a new advertising  campaign which paints the Government's frontbench as a bunch of headless chooks.  Let's take a look. Scott Morrison joins us now. Scott, would you say - it's fair enough  to put out an ad like that, but when are we going to see an ad from the Coalition that  outlines its policies?

SCOTT MORRISON: Well, many of our policies we have just been discussing - our  policies in border protection just before the break-

KATHRYN ROBINSON: But an ad?

SCOTT MORRISON: And there will be plenty of opportunity to do more of that  between now and the next election. I mean, this ad is a social media, effectively, ad,  and I'm sure it will get plenty of people having a look at it. Because, look, it's saying  something which IÃ¢ÂÂm picking up as I move around the country - and that is, that this  Government has frankly become a bit of a joke, and itÃ¢ÂÂs sort of gone past that tipping  point where a series of mistakes and problems have just turned into a cavalcade of  them, and it's a daily basis, and I think thatÃ¢ÂÂs-

LAUREN WILSON: But is this an indication that youÃ¢ÂÂre going to fight an election  campaign based on Labor's political mistakes, in your opinion, rather than your own  policies?

SCOTT MORRISON: Well, I think we will continue to do what we've always done,  and that will hold the Government to account, but we will also continue to provide our  alternative. I mean, again, in the border protection space, no one could accuse the  Coalition of not being clear and articulate about what our views are and how we  intend to act if weÃ¢ÂÂre elected to government. So it's a combination of both. I mean, the  frustration with this Government - I mean, I get it every day. I mean, “Can't we have  an election this weekend?” People often say to me as we move around. Now, the  Prime Minister has said in September - it will be in September and the party  organisation here in making this point and putting this ad out, I think, is given a pretty  good summary of where the Government's message and actions and performance and  competence have been.

HUGH RIMINTON: Well, whatever you are hearing as you go around, the Prime  Minister today says she believes she can win the election. Do you think she can?

SCOTT MORRISON: Well, we take nothing for granted on our side. And we will  continue to do what we've always done in Opposition - work on our policies, put them  forward, make our case, and hold the Government to account. And people will make

up their mind in September of this year about which way they want to go. That's  always their choice - it's not for us to commentate on the outcome of election, that's  for others to do. It's ours to earn the trust of the Australian people.

HUGH RIMINTON: Tony Abbott-

SCOTT MORRISON: As we've been working hard to do.

HUGH RIMINTON: On one issue - Tony Abbott took an issue off the table in the  course of the last week when he agreed to support - again, with some reluctance - the  levy for the NDIS. Is this going to be the policy, the approach if you like, that youÃ¢ÂÂre  going to pick your fights going to this election? You might even start agreeing with  the Government on a few things?

SCOTT MORRISON: Well weÃ¢ÂÂve - we've never stood in the way of the NDIS. We've  always stood to facilitate it and support it at every opportunity along this process. So-

HUGH RIMINTON: The levy is uncomfortable, though, for many in the party,  including the Shadow Treasurer, Joe Hockey.

SCOTT MORRISON: Sure, but weÃ¢ÂÂve never stood in the way of this process. We've  always been supportive of the NDIS process. It's been very disappointing, the Prime  Minister has sought to pick a fight on this, a political fight on this, in the way that she  sought to manage this in the past week, which is disappointing. Because our form on  the NDIS has been to be supportive at every step, and not put any blockages in the  way, as we'd done again on this occasion.

LAUREN WILSON: You had your Treasury spokesperson saying earlier in the week  that the levy would have a detrimental economic impact. How much dissent was there  in senior Liberal ranks over Tony Abbott's decision to back in this levy?

SCOTT MORRISON: Well I think what we saw over the course of the week is the  issues were canvassed and the various perspectives, I think, were put out there in the  public space. And Joe, I thought, made some very important points about all of this.  But at the end of the day, what we have done is said we are not standing in the way of  the NDIS. We have asked the Prime Minister to come and be upfront when we go  back to the Parliament. How is she going to fund the rest of it? Joe was making that  point, I think, very well and very strongly. I mean, we will support the levy, but we do  need to know how the rest of it is going to be funded, and how this scheme is going to  actually work. I mean, who's in, who's not? Are people who have conditions such as  AspergerÃ¢ÂÂs, or things of that nature - are they in or are they out? And I think the  commitment and appetite for this scheme, I think, is very strong and very positive  right across the community, and the Opposition reflects that.

HUGH RIMINTON: On another quick issue, there's a commitment and an appetite  for a change to same-sex marriage laws. Tony Abbott has indicated that won't be on  the agenda of a first-term government if the Coalition is returned. Are you completely  comfortable with that?

SCOTT MORRISON: Well I'm comfortable with it. But the problem - the point about  this is, is that the last election we took a position and said we werenÃ¢ÂÂt going to change  that. And we've been faithful to that position in the term of this Parliament. Now  frankly, getting the Budget back into surplus, stopping-

HUGH RIMINTON: No, no, but what about - what about the next term of  Parliament?

SCOTT MORRISON: -the boats, border protection, all of these…

HUGH RIMINTON: Ok, that's the history lesson, but what about the next one?

SCOTT MORRISON: I was talking about the next term. Getting the Budget back into  surplus, cleaning up the mess of the Labor Party that they will leave behind. I mean,  Hugh, we could have anywhere between 20 and 30,000 people in Australia, onshore,  many of whom havenÃ¢ÂÂt been processed or had their claims even looked at, a detention  network which continues to spiral out of control - now thatÃ¢ÂÂs where my focus will be,  and that is where I think the Australian people expect my focus to be. They expect  Joe's focus to be on balancing that Budget, and Tony in ensuring that we clean up this  mess that Labor have left behind. Now, thatÃ¢ÂÂs our top order issues and that is what  weÃ¢ÂÂll focus on.

KATHRYN ROBINSON: Shadow Immigration Minister, Scott Morrison, thank you  for taking time out to speak with us today on Meet The Press.

SCOTT MORRISON: Great to be with you, thank you.
