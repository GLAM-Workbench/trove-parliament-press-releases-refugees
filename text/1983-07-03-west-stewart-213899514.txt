COMMUNIQUE FROM CONFERENCE OF COMMONWEALTH AND STATE  MINISTERS RESPONSIBLE FOR IMMIGRATION AND ETHNIC AFFAIRS  CANBERRA, 1 JULY 1983

Commonwealth and State Ministers responsible for  immigration and ethnic affairs met in Canberra on  1 July to discuss a range of issues. The Conference  was also attended by representatives of the New Zealand  Government.

Ministers expressed support for the modifications recently  introduced by the Commonwealth Government to the policies  and size of immigration and refugee programs. These  changes place much greater emphasis on the entry of  relatives of residents of Australia and restrict the  entry of independent migrants for employment to prevent  competition, with job seekers in Australia. There was  also support for the Commonwealth Government's intention  to diversify the refugee program in order to respond  without discrimination to the wide range of refugee

situations around the world. There was also support  for continuation of the free flow movement under the Trans  Tasman Travel Arrangement.

In discussing the migrant intake, there was support also  for the development of new arrangements to ensure that  future recruitment of workers for Australia was fully  consistent with Australia's manpower needs.

Ministers agreed on the importance of providing  comprehensive, accurate and up-to-date information to  migrants both overseas and after arrival in Australia.

Arrangements are to be made to regularly bring.together  immigration information officers from all States the  Northern Territory and the Commonwealth to ensure that  there is a co-ordinated information program adequately  meeting the diverse needs of migrants.

Ministers also welcomed steps currently being taken to  adjust post arrival services for migrants, to ensure that  those settling directly into the community under family  reunion and other arrangements. ,  have access to orientation,   English language and other services,  equal to those

living in migrant hostels.

Ministers agreed on the importance of a comprehensive  and co-ordinated program of services to assist unattached  refugee children arriving in Australia. The Commonwealth  Government confirmed that it would be proceeding wi fch  the undertaking to admit 100 Khmer minors,  although it  was recognised that not all would be likely to enter  Australia in the current financial year.  Ministers agreed

to review and co-ordinate the various programs for  assisting refugee, settlement.

Ministers supported the findings of the Report of the  Committee of Inquiry into the Recognition of Overseas  Qualifications (Fry Committee) which was tabled in  the Commonwea1th Parliament on 12 M ay.  There was  agreement; in principle from all States to the development  of measures to extend equitable recognition of overseas  professional,  technical and trade qualifications. It

was noted that this would require a concerted effort on  the part of Commonwealth, State and Territory Governments  and a high degree of co-operation and commitment to _ achieve this important goal.

Ministers agreed on the need for relevant Commonwealth  and State or Territory officials to work together to  minimize any tensions between different community croups  and to co-ordinate the delivery of services to migrants.   They undertook to review existing regional consultative  arrangements and strengthen these where appropriate.

Ministers confirmed the need to amend the Citizenship Act  to remove discrimination,  anomalies and anaebronisms,  and  asked for the opportunity to.examine the Bill after  introduction.  .

Ministers agreed on the need to finalise arrangements for  the establishrnent of a Â»ew national registration body to  take over from the National Accredit a tion Authority for ,

Translators.  and Interpreters (NAAT1) within the next few-  weeks,  including Commonwealth,  State and Territory  appointments to.that body. .

It was agreed in principle that a joint review would be  undertaken of interpreter and translator services around  Australia and of the extent to which they meet the needs  of non-English speakers.

Ministers welcomed the establishment of a Women's Desk  within the Commonwealth Department of Immigration and  Ethnic Affairs and agreed to give particular attention  to developing Commonwealth and State initiatives directed

toward overcoming the special problems faced by migrant  women. The Commonwealth stressed its agreement to  examine funding to assist women's refuges in using the  Telephone Interpreter Service to communicate with
