Arc of Instability. Arc of Insecurity.

The centrality of the region in Australian foreign and security policy after 12 October

Mr Kevin Rudd MP Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs

Address to The Sydney Institute Sydney

Wednesday 23 October 2002

Bali marks a turning point in Australian foreign policy.

It marks a turning point in Australian security policy.

It marks a turning point in how we view ourselves in the region and in the world.

Beyond all these things, Bali has seared the nation’s mind, its memory and its soul.

There is a temptation in policy elites to regard foreign policy and security policy as high policy - well removed from the influences, the impact and the impulses of the general community.

Just as that is no longer true of the United States after September 11, so too is it also no longer true for Australia after October 12?

2

For Australians, foreign and security policy have become personal, relevant and immediate. It is no longer an abstraction from everyday life. It has become central to everyday life - and death.

And as a consequence, it is a realm of policy which now moves from the periphery to the centre of our national political debate.

Because the stakes are so high, it is a debate that will require considered, policy leadership - not a series of political key lines and themes.

Foreign Policy Values

To make sense of the complex foreign policy terrain in which we now operate, we must be clear from the outset on the values which shape our policy response to that terrain.

Much of what I argue tonight I’ve argued before - because our task in politics is often to repeat and to repeat again.

But some of what I argue tonight I have not argued before, because the consequences of Bali redefine in part where precisely our current national security priorities must lie.

Foreign policy must be more than a series of random responses to events as they occur.

It must occur within a framework of continuing values within a changing world. Values which shape our vision for the nation - and for the region and world of which our nation is part.

For Labor, there are five such values:

Labor is committed to a secure Australia.

Labor is committed to a competitive Australia.

Labor is committed to a compassionate Australia.

Labor is committed to an Australia that is comprehensively engaged with its neighbours and engaged with its region.

And Labor is committed to a robust Australian role in the strengthening of the multilateral system.

To some, these interests and values may seem unremarkable, even commonplace. The truth is that each involves a body of work which is as

3

complex as it is formidable. And the complexity derives from the uncertainty of the international terrain in which we must now operate - not just a post Cold War world, but now a post September 11/post October 12 world as well.

Beyond Bali, there will be areas of substantial agreement with the Government.  Of course, from a national interest point of view, this is entirely desirable.  A nation of limited critical mass such as our own should have a bipartisan foreign policy.

However, bipartisanship comes at a price.  And that price is a broad consensus on the direction in which we seek to take the nation - and the interests and values that shape that direction.

In the last several years bipartisanship has begun to unravel. It has become fragile, brittle and at times has verged on cracking altogether on a range of foreign policy challenges that face the nation.

Nowhere has this unravelling become more apparent than in Australia’s foreign and security policy engagement with our immediate region - with South East Asia and the South West Pacific.

This region brings into sharp focus virtually the complete spectrum of our core foreign policy values: security, economic opportunity, as well as the challenge that the region presents to our sense of decency and compassion - given the under-development and poverty that is so much part of the region.

Labor has long been committed to a policy of comprehensive engagement in Asia. This is not the product of some misty-eyed sentimentalism as our opponents sometimes infer. Nor is it a product of our denial of the western cultures and civilisation from which we predominantly derive. It is none of these things.

Labor’s commitment to comprehensive engagement in our region is based on two very simply propositions. We believe that if we have good relations with our neighbours, it is good for our security interests and it is good for our economic interests.

Secondly, we believe that if we have bad or indifferent relations with our neighbours, the reverse applies.

Some in their heart of hearts and in their mind of minds, would ideally prefer this continent to be towed 10,000 kilometres to the north east and be located somewhere at about a mid-point between Hawaii and California. It is my melancholy duty to inform them that this is not possible.

4

Our core challenge is to argue the case to the Australian people that disengagement from Asia will occur at a price. It will cost us in terms of our security. It will cost us in terms of our economy.

We must also explode the mythology perpetuated by some in the Australian domestic political debate that our relations with Asia and our relations with America constitute some sort of crude, zero sum game. They do not. And if evidence is needed of this, we need look no further than the Hawke and Keating governments when a robust relationship with the United States was complimented by a comprehensive policy of engagement with the region.

History of regional engagement

The history of Australia’s Asian engagement is a complex one.

For much of the 19th century, Australians regarded Asia with the combination of racial xenophobia and religious condescension.

The region was regarded as ripe for the harvest of souls - as Australians joined other European missionaries in the attempted conversion of the continent, aided and abetted by gunboat diplomacy and the political and economic imperialism of the time. We were bit players in the grander schemes of empire.

After 1905, however, missionary passion yielded to strategic paranoia as Asia, in the Australian mind, came to be dominated by Japanese imperialism, Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese and South East Asian communism as well as “Confrontation” with Indonesia. The region, increasingly, was seen as a dangerous place - both in itself and as a platform for potential strategic operations against Australia.

Broadly, this lasted until the mid 1970s when strategic concern was replaced by economic opportunity for the period of the Asian economic miracle. This, however, came to a grinding halt in the late 1990s with the Asian financial crisis. While the region continues to represent a large market for Australian exports, in the 1990s Asia did not realise the exponential growth performance that had been projected for it in the 1980s. Asia, nonetheless, grew to become this country’s region of greatest economic importance - a position that it retains to this day.

Australian engagement of Asia in the period since 1975 had been underpinned by a bipartisan foreign policy consensus. Elsewhere, I have described this elsewhere as the “Whitlam Consensus.” It comprised a number of key elements, including both a continued commitment to the US alliance, and a policy of comprehensive engagement with Asia. This consensus was sustained during the prime ministerships of Whitlam, Fraser, Hawke and

5

Keating - and was reflected in the foreign policy postures of Opposition leaders Hayden, Peacock, Hewson and Beazley.

Underlying this bipartisan consensus on strategic engagement with Asia was a concept of regional strategic community - involving Australia, New Zealand, the island states of the South West Pacific as well as ASEAN in South East Asia.

This was given expression in the Australian Labor Government’s Defence White Paper in 1986 and, in its headiest moments, in the bilateral security treaty between Australia and Indonesia a decade later. From an Australian perspective, threats to our national security were defined as primarily coming from or through the archipelagic waters to our north.

For this entire period, the logic of regional strategic engagement reinforced the parallel logic of regional economic opportunity. For Australia, it seemed, there was little other choice for its future.

The unravelling of Asian engagement

This bipartisan consensus underpinning comprehensive regional engagement was not, however, destined to last. From 1996, it began to suffer death by a thousand cuts.

Last month, we celebrated the third anniversary of the proclamation of the so-called  Howard  Doctrine  -  the  government’s  self-styled,  albeit  short-lived, revolution in the overall conduct of Australian foreign policy in the region.

The  Howard  Doctrine  was  announced  as  a  blueprint  for  Australia’s  future engagement  of  Asia;  but  it  became,  at  least  in  the  eyes  of  the  region,  a blueprint for Australia’s future disengagement from Asia.

Surprisingly,  the  passage  of this  most  significant  of anniversaries  appears  to have passed almost without comment.  Why is this so?

For  those  who  have  forgotten what  the  Howard  Doctrine is (or  was),  let  me remind  you  by  quoting  from  its  primary  source  document,  the  Prime Minister’s famous interview with The Bulletin magazine of 28 September 1999. It  was  an  interview  given  to  that  magazine’s  Fred  Brenchley.   It  was  an interview  given  in  what  most  have  subsequently  agreed  was  a  fit  of  Prime Ministerial hubris immediately following the conclusion of the first phase of the Australian military operation in East Timor.

As The Bulletin noted, “Prime Minister John Howard believes East Timor marks a turning point in Australia’s external relations, not just with Indonesia but with the entire  region  to  our  north.   He  has  told  The  Bulletin  how  Australia’s  foreign  and

6

security policies are to be re-cast.  The Howard Doctrine - the PM himself embraces the  term  -  sees  Australia  acting  in  a  sort  of  ‘deputy’  peacekeeping  capacity  in  our region to the global policeman role of the US.”

The  Bulletin  interview  continued:  “Overturning  what  he  sees  as  the  Keating-Hawke  attempt  to  make  Australia  ‘much  like  the  countries  in  the  region’,  Howard sees  East  Timor  demonstrating  Australia’s  strengths  via  its  distinctive characteristics.  The Howard Doctrine will put less emphasis on ‘special relations’ in the region.” … “Casting back to the Keating period, he says; we looked as though we were  knocking  on  their  door  saying  ‘please  let  us  in’  instead  of  realising  we  were always somebody they would want to have in because of our particular strength, and that (now) has been demonstrated.”

So rather than 'special relationships' or ‘knocking on the door’, what did the Prime  Minister  offer  as  an  alternative.  According  to  the  Bulletin:  “Howard embraces  the  ‘deputy’  concept,  and  points  out  that  Australia  has  performed  that regional role in East Timor in a way that could not be done in Europe.  In the Balkans conflict  ultimately  there  has  to  be  ‘massive  American  involvement’.   ‘It  is  a  very interesting  strategic  parallel’,  he  says,  ‘obviously  there  are  some  differences  between the  Balkans  and  East  Timor,  but  it  is  still  nonetheless  a  parallel  that  is  worth making.’”

Leaving aside the Prime Minister’s curious observations about the Balkans, let us recapitulate the core concepts of the doctrine to which the Prime Minister, for  a  time  at  least,  was  pleased  to  give  his  name.   There  appear  to  be  three central elements:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ First,  that  the  Hawke/Keating  strategy  of  regional  engagement  was wrong;  because  (in  the  Prime  Minister’s  view)  that  strategy  sought  to make Australia like Asia;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Second,  that  it  was  somehow  demeaning  for  Australia  to  seek  admission into the principal institutions of the region; Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Third,  by  contrast,  the  way  to  advance  Australia’s  interests  in  the  region was  not  to  seek  to  develop  greater  affinity  with  Asia,  but  instead  to

demonstrate our separateness from Asia by acting as a regional deputy to the global superpower interests of the United States.  A sort of sidekick to Wyatt  Earp  with  our  corner  of  the  OK  Corral  being  over  here  in  South-East Asia.

When  the  Brenchley  story  broke,  it  was  followed  by  a  day  or  two  of  half-hearted defence by Prime Ministerial advisors.  There were dark references as to whether or not the journalist had quite got the story right.  But following a fusillade of reaction from around the region (not to mention the foreign policy community of this country as well) the Howard doctrine, within a week, was allowed quietly to sink without trace. It was, however, and remains today, a significant  insight  into  the  deepest  foreign  policy  instincts  of  our  Prime Minister.

7

There  are  therefore  several  reasons  why  we  can’t  just  consign  the  entire episode of the Howard doctrine safely to history.  The first is that while many people in this country may have forgotten about it, the rest of the region has not.   The  Howard  doctrine  received  headline  treatment  right  around  Asia from Beijing to Bangkok to Islamabad.  And without exception, the coverage was bad.

The  ‘take  out  message’  across  the  neighbourhood  was  this:  that  Australia’s hitherto bipartisan foreign policy of comprehensive regional engagement was at an end.  And that Australia in the future saw its primary role in the region as the eyes, ears, and if necessary, the sword of the United States.

Furthermore, the Howard Doctrine has not been a single, isolated event in the overall evolution of this government’s foreign policy towards the region.  It is, regrettably,  one  of  many  such  events.   And  it  is  the  combination  of  these events that forms a pattern.

A central hallmark of this pattern is a retreat from Australia’s long-standing policy  of  engagement  of  the  region  -  to  a  new  policy  of  differentiation  from the  region.   In  this  context,  the  Howard  Doctrine  itself  has  merely  been  a metaphor,  albeit  a  striking  one,  a  sort  of  shorthand  descriptor  of  a  much deeper and disturbing reality.

Disengagement from Asia is not just about the Howard doctrine. Ã¢ÂÂ¢ It  is  about  Hansonism  and  the  Prime  Minister’s  Voltairean  defence  of Hanson  at  the  height  of  her  power  as  well  as  his  stated  agreement  with ‘some’ of the positions she enunciated;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ It  is  also  about  Downer’s  1999  doctrine  of  ‘practical  regionalism’  which separates  out  ‘cultural  regionalism’  (that  which  Asians  have  with  one another) from ‘practical regionalism’ (that which Australia has with Asia, because in Downer’s schemata, Australia is principally concerned in Asia with the economy and not beyond);

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ It is also about the government’s disinterest in the decline of APEC; Ã¢ÂÂ¢ It  is  about  the  government’s  disinterest  in  Australian  membership  of  a range of regional arrangements including ASEAN plus three, AFTA/ CER and ASEM;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ It is about the demise of Radio Australia and its Asian language programs; Ã¢ÂÂ¢ It  is  about  the  government’s  failure  to  continue  to  fund  the

implementation  of  the  national  Asian  languages  and  studies  strategy  for Australian schools - a strategy which in 1994 had bipartisan support, but not in 2002.

For those who thought that Asian disengagement could go no further under the Howard Government with its re-election last November, a careful perusal of  the  Prime  Minister’s  contemporary  record  is  warranted.  The  Prime

8

Minister,  for  example,  in  his  address  to  the  Federal  Council  of  the  Liberal Party in April this year spoke at length on the need to “rebalance” Australia’s relations with the rest of the world - most particularly in favour of the United States and Western Europe.

The impact of Bali

Prior  to  Bali,  therefore,  a  considerable  gap  had  emerged  between  our respective political parties’ views on the centrality of the region in the overall architecture of this country’s foreign policy: Labor arguing over a number of decades for the absolute importance of comprehensive regional engagement; the Coalition arguing that the region, while significant, was nonetheless one a number  of  regions  of  importance  to  Australia  -  the  others  being  Western Europe and North America.

In fact, Coalition argumentation on this score, has in recent times been augmented by a view of globalisation that “regions,” as a function of geography, are rendered more and more functionally redundant over time as a consequence of globalisation. In other words, global capital, in relentless pursuit of market opportunities, respects neither political boundary nor geographical region. And, with the entrenchment of the “Washington Consensus”, whereby neo-liberal policy settings become the entrenched policy orthodoxy across both the OECD and the G77, neither concepts of “nation” nor “region” remain meaningful in an increasingly neo- liberal global economic order.

Of course, this states the case “in extremis”.     But this has been one of the factors driving the conservative’s re-evaluation of the overall significance of this region in the re-casting of their overall foreign policy. I also understand that this has been one of the factors shaping the conceptual structure of the Government’s Foreign Policy White Paper - although I further understand that one of the impacts of Bali has been to send the draft White Paper back to the drawing board and for its release next month to be deferred - to provide an opportunity for its assumptions to be fundamentally recast.

The Asian Economic Crisis has also had an effect.  Time and again during the period of the last Parliament, we heard the Deputy Prime Minister and Trade Minister claim that Australia had been impacted less by the Asian Economic Crisis than would otherwise have been because the case because the Coalition had abandoned what he described as Labor’s “Asia-Only” foreign policy and foreign economic policy.

While as a matter of logic this makes no sense at all - our national economy’s capacity to weather the Asian Economic Crisis having been delivered by the internationalisation of the Australian economy after a decade and a half of economic reform from the early 80s on - the political rhetoric of the

9

Government was once again instructive: Labor, it argued, is obsessed with the region; the Coalition, being the more rounded bunch of chaps they are, was not.

A third driving factor over the last several years in the Coalition’s reassessment of the region is deeply cultural. Anyone doubting this proposition should look once again at the Prime Minister’s address to the Federal Council of the Liberal Party in April this year. As noted above, that address spoke explicitly of the need to “rebalance” Australia’s international engagement in the direction of the cultural heartlands of North America and Western Europe. It follows also as a matter of logic, if you are “rebalancing” your international relationships in the direction of North America and Western Europe, you are simultaneously correcting what you believe to be an imbalance in this country’s previous pattern of international engagement - in other words, away from Asia.

It is interesting to note that post-Bali, Treasurer Peter Costello, in an address last week, sought to reinvent himself with a latter day re-discovery of Asian engagement. It’s a pity the Treasurer hadn’t displayed an earlier enthusiasm on this subject when his Prime Minister, the former Deputy Prime Minister and the current Foreign Minister were individually and collectively embarked on a campaign of incremental disengagement.

This overall debate on the future orientation of our foreign policy has been reflected in a parallel debate on the future direction of Australian national security policy. In the main, this debate has also been between what could broadly be described as the two great schools: the “Global School” of strategic analysis which says that in the new security policy age, Australian security policy, the force structure of the Australian Defence Force and its operational doctrine should increasingly be oriented to global operations as part of coalition activities - directly principally, but not exclusively, by the United States. Hence the reality of Afghanistan. And hence the potentiality of Iraq.

Second, there is what could be broadly described as the “Regional School.” Since the Dibb Report of the mid 1980s and Labor’s Defence White Paper of the late 1980s, this “Regional School” argues a central organising principle that the main threat to Australia would come through the archipelegic waters to our north.  This “Regional School” has been ridiculed in recent years as the “Concentric Circles School” whereby security policy planners were criticised for being asked to conceptualise the defence of Australia in terms of a layered defence in response to layers of direct threats from within our own immediate region.

Broadly, the Coalition, in its public argumentation, has argued the case for the Global School. And broadly, we on our side continue to argue the Regional School.

10

While national security policy, as already discussed, goes considerably beyond the force structure and operational doctrine of the ADF, the truth of the matter is that the ADF remains the core part of the business.

As Brigadier Wallace, former Commander of the SAS, reminded us recently, there is a grave danger of inflicting upon the ADF doctrinal schizophrenia - that is, having on the one hand in place a strategic doctrine which emphasises the centrality of Australia’s global role as part of a world-wide system of alliances; while on the other hand retaining a force structure shaped by the strategic guidance of the Labor Government of the 80s and early 90s that emphasised the centrality of regional operations in South East Asia and, more specifically, in the direct defence of Australia.

The specific nature of Brigadier Wallace’s criticism was that in the case of the SAS, they have succeeded in their Afghanistan deployment despite (not because of) the doctrinal guidance the ADF has been operating under. In other words, they have been an SAS trained and equipped to fight in our immediate region and in northern Australia itself, rather than the quite different operating environments represented by Afghanistan and, prospectively, as the Government has suggested, in Iraq.

Brigadier Wallace added that in order to be ready for Afghanistan, the SAS had, in part, to ignore some of the doctrinal guidance it had been given. But notwithstanding that particular feat of organisational defiance, tens of millions of dollars still had to be rapidly expended to bring them to a state of organisational and equipment readiness for field conditions in Afghanistan.

Of course this broader debate between Australia playing a global strategic role, as opposed to an immediately regional strategic role, has profound strategic resonances.  On and off, this small country of ours has been conducting this debate since 1941. Between those who favoured grander British and American expeditionary forces on the one hand, as opposed to those who have argued that given our resource constraints, a more practicable goal is securing our immediate region and the direct defence of Australia.

You will recall that that was the core of Curtin’s dispute with Churchill in 1941: Greece, North Africa and the Mediterranean as opposed to Singapore, New Guinea and the Coral Sea.

More than half a century later, there are still strong residues of this divide between the conservatives and Labor on how we go about approaching Australian security policy today. The Government has spoken for itself in this debate, through the Prime Minister, the Foreign Minister and the Defence Minister. And I don’t intend today to describe in detail their many statements on this matter. They can speak for themselves.

11

Our view is clear. If you look to our immediate strategic environment, while Pacific in name, it is barely pacific in nature.

Much has been said in recent days about Bali. Much has also been said about the increasing profile of radical Islamicist terrorist organisations operating across the Indonesian archipelago. And some things have been written about the broader role of such organisations elsewhere in South East Asia.

The truth of the matter is that there are now significant challenges to domestic security in Indonesia, the Philippines and elsewhere.

There is at present a battle for hearts and minds being waged across Islamic South East Asia. It is uncertain how this struggle will resolve itself. The forces of secular and moderate Islam plainly represent the majority. But there are other forces, small in number but highly organised.

Strategic analogies between what is happening now and what happened in the 50s and 60s during the period of communist insurgency in parts of South East Asia are not far fetched. We are facing an increasingly grave security crisis in parts of South East Asia.

To the East there are the emerging problems in West Papua.

Beyond that there is the breakdown of domestic law and order in Papua New Guinea.

There are emerging security and political difficulties in Vanuatu.

In the Solomons, we have seen the comprehensive failure of the Townville Peace Agreement and the degeneration of the Solomons Island polity into something approaching semi-organised, gang warfare.

And then there is Fiji which has suffered two military coups detach in the last two decades and where political stability remains problematic.

Each of these states of sub-national entities represents objective security problems in themselves.  In some cases we see the emergence of the problems of failed states and the inability to control internal or transnational security challenges which confront them. This is not of marginal interest to Australia. It is central to Australian security interests.

Australians in large numbers visit many of these countries. And Australia is often regarded as a country of first asylum for those within these countries in the event of domestic political implosion.

12

Starkly, my overall point is this. Australia’s immediate region represents a very full caseload for Australian security policy to contend with in itself - well before looking to more exotic locations beyond our region.

Taken seriously, they represent a very full intray indeed for Australian Ministers responsible for our immediate national security.

Furthermore, from the perspective of our broader alliance obligations, the United States has a fundamental interest in Australia maximising the strategic stability of South East Asia - most particularly in this age of global terrorism.

For some years, our immediate region has been described by the analysts as an “Arc of Instability.”

Since last weekend, our immediate region has become for the Australian people, not just the analysts, an “Arc of Insecurity”.

Relations with Indonesia

I’ve spoken about broader South East Asia. I’ve also spoken about the broader South West Pacific - in particular the raft of security policy problems which now present themselves across Melanesia. I must also address our political relationship with Indonesia.

Given Australia’s long-standing geo-strategic circumstances, an effective political relationship with the Government of Indonesia is central to our long-standing security policy interests.

It may also be significant, if not central, to Indonesia’s long-term stability as well.

The two, of course, are related. Part of the politics of differentiation on the part of the Coalition over the past several years has been systematically to ridicule the Keating Government’s emphasis on the centrality of the Jakarta relationship.

Paul Keating in particular was ridiculed for the closeness of his personal relationship with former President Suharto.

A quick perusal of the Parliamentary record will reveal copious references to this line of personal political vilification otherwise masked as serious foreign policy analysis.

Paul Keating did not get everything right. But the central thing he did get right was when it came to dealing with the range of transnational threats to our nation’s and our region’s security was that a functionally effective

13

relationship with Jakarta was key.

It was key to the breadth and density of the intelligence flows between us.

It was key to the operational management of unauthorised international people movements through the Indonesia archipelago.

It was key to the management of a range of other transnational threats to security as well.

But the problem is that over the past five years from 1997, this relationship has become increasingly dysfunctional.

It would be analytically flawed to lay all the responsibility for this at the feet of the Howard Government. This is a period in which we have seen the most massive changes in Indonesian domestic politics since 1965 - arguably since 1947. However, if you ask people who have worked in our intelligence community to compare and contrast the intelligence flows between Jakarta and Canberra as they existed say in June 1997 and then June 2002, the flow has slowed to a trickle.

This fact of itself is of fundamental importance to Australian national security.

Prior to the collapse of the new order regime, Prime Minister Howard made little effort to establish a working relationship with President Suharto.

He paid them even less attention to President Suharto’s successor, President Habibi - prior to the East Timor crisis.

Plainly, East Timor had a significant impact on the quality of the bilateral relationship. In the broad, we have said repeatedly on the public record that we believe the actions taken by the Australian Government on East Timor were right. Equally, we are on the public record as saying that in the period post East Timor, the Government’s management of the restoration of the Jakarta relationship has not been right.

The appalling triumphalism of the Prime Minister’s “Howard Doctrine” immediately following the resolution of East Timor had as much an effect on Indonesian perceptions of the Australian government as had the objective differences between the two Governments on the East Timor question itself.

Following East Timor, the Government’s view of the Jakarta relationship was that it was simply all too hard. It could never be restored to what it was. And there was no point in trying.

Things became so ragged last year, following the Prime Minister’s visit to

14

Indonesia, that one of his travelling party, according to a leading Australian columnist, saw fit to describe President Megawati Sukarnoputri as the “Helen Keller” of Indonesia politics.

That sort of cavalier management of a relationship of central importance to Australia, while perhaps personally gratifying, simultaneously undermines the long-term national interests of this country.

The bilateral relationship reached a further nadir during the height of the asylum seeker crisis in 2001. The truth of the matter was that Australia’s political relationship with Jakarta had become so poor, that the Government was unable to secure the most basic forms of cooperation from the Indonesian Government to control unauthorised international people movements through the Indonesian archipelago.

Some improvement has occurred since the appointment of the current Indonesian Foreign Minister, who has sought to restore some functionality to the bilateral relationship - including the signing of an MOU on security cooperation earlier this year and the decision to work co-jointly with Australia on a regional framework for the long-term resolution of people smuggling across South East Asia.

These developments are welcome. But they come after a welter of damage that has been done to the bilateral relationship - not all of it, by any stretch, attributable to the East Timor factor.

International political relationships are in many respects not unlike personal relationships. They require time, work, personal conviviality and sustained goodwill.

That remains the task today. The political relationship once again needs to be restored to the point that the Indonesian Government sees it in its interests to assist Australian interests in the complex security policy environment in which we now operate.

International campaign against terrorism

Our  relationship  with  Indonesia,  the  spread  of  radicalist,  Islamicist  terrorist organisations  across  South  East  Asia,  as  well  as  the  raft  of  chronic  security problems  that  beset  much  of  Melanesia,  collectively  represent  challenges  to our  national  security  that  are  now  more  complex  than  at  any  time  since  the Malaysian Insurgency and “Confrontation.”

To  deal  with  this  challenge  will  require  the  complete  deployment  of Australian  political,  diplomatic  and  security  policy  resources  for  the  decade ahead. It is not just in Australia’s national interests that we do so. It is also in

15

the alliance’s interests that we do so as well.

Within the framework of the US alliance, the United States has long expressed the  view  that  Australia  has  a  particular  responsibility  in  relation  to  security and stability in South East Asia.

That view has also long framed the arrangements between Australian and the United States in their intelligence relationship.

This  becomes  particularly  critical  in  the  post  September  11/post  October  12 international order where terrorism is now a (if not the) central factor in the security policy environment.

Working  at  the  highest  levels  with  the  Government  of  Indonesia  and  other governments in South East Asia on the elimination of terrorism in our region, is not only of great importance to Australia but also to the United States and other US allies. If terrorism flourishes in South East Asia, it is not only a threat to  Australia.  It  is  plainly  a  threat  to  broader  western  interests  -  and  more fundamentally, to the secular governments of this region as well.

For  this  reason,  the  Federal  Opposition  last  week  proposed  that  the  first priority of our Prime Minister should be the convening of a regional summit at heads of government level across South East Asia with a single agenda item - the elimination of regional terrorism. No one country in our region can do this  using  its  own  resources.   It  will  require  the  highest-level  regional, political  and  security  cooperation  of  the  type  we  have  not  seen  before.  And for this country that will require the full harnessing of our national capacities.

Does  that  mean  Australia  should  immediately  withdraw  from  the  global campaign against terrorism? Not at all. The Opposition continues to support Australian  Government  policy  on  our  military  deployments  in  Afghanistan. The  elimination  of  al  Qaeda  is  plainly  central  to  the  response  to  terrorism worldwide.  It is equally a central response to the problem of terrorism within our own region. The Indonesian Defence Minister himself has stated that JI’s operations in Indonesia are supported by al Qaeda.

Australia,  therefore,  must  continue  to  stand  shoulder  to  shoulder  with  the United  States  and  others  in  a  global  and  a  regional  campaign  to  eliminate terrorism.

But because of our proximity to the largest Islamic country on the planet, and because Australian nationals within our immediate region are now known for the  first  time  to  be  the  explicit  targets  of  terrorist  organisations,  Australia’s national  priority  in  the  global  campaign  against  terrorism  must  be  our  own region.

16

To  fail  to  recognise  this  fundamental  fact  would  be  to  repeat  the  strategic errors of the late 1930s and early 1940s when various governments of the time concluded  that  the  most  important  threat  to  Australian  security  lay  well beyond  our  immediate  strategic  environment.  The  events  of  1941 demonstrated  that  that  was  not  the  case.  Just  as  the  events  of  2002 demonstrate that that is once again not the case.

Australians now, must think beyond the square.

For some at that time, Australia’s security could only be delivered by Britain. Curtin  disagreed.  He  looked  beyond  the  square  and,  as  a  consequence, Australian security was assured.

The  enduring  legacy  of  Curtin  for  Australian  security  policy  must  first  and foremost be our own immediate region.

Iraq

So where does that leave Australia on the other great question of our time - Iraq?

The UN Security Council continues to deliberate on an appropriate resolution for  the  restoration  of  weapons  inspectors.  Let  us  all  hope  that  that  process comes  to  a  rapid  and  successful  conclusion.  Labor  policy  on  Iraq  has  been consistent since we first framed it in April this year.

Labor has consistently argued for the exhaustion of UN processes. Labor has consistently argued that, because of Iraq’s flagrant violation of successive UN Security Council resolutions over its possession weapons of mass destruction, that it should be dealt by the mechanisms available under the UN Charter.

Labor has consistently argued that Saddam Hussein is a mass murderer who is responsible for crimes against humanity and should, as Richard Butler has also  argued,  be  dealt  with  under  appropriate  international  judicial institutions.

Labor  has  consistently  argued  that  the  terrorist  networks  associated  with September 11 (and now October 12) must be eliminated.  To date, we have no direct evidence linking Iraq with the events of September 11.

Labor  has  consistently  argued  against  a  US  pre-emptive  strike  unless  very powerful  evidence  can  be  presented  which  establishes  that  Iraqi  WMD represent  not  just  an  abstract  threat  but  a  real  and  present  danger  to  our security  -  of  a  type  that  has  not  existed  during  the  previous  decade  when Saddam  Hussein  has  been  in  possession  of  WMD.  To  date,  we  are  not  in possession of information that would support such an argument.

Labor is of the view that public speculation by the Prime Minister about the possible deployment of an Australian armoured brigade is irresponsible.

Labor has stated that its policy objective on Iraq is not one of regime change. Foreign Minister Downer has said that his policy is one of regime change.

Labor’s  policy  objective  on  Iraq  is  to  secure  Iraq’s  comprehensive disarmament consistent with UN Security Council resolutions.

And  in  all  these  things,  Labor  has  argued  from  the  beginning  that  Labor’s policy  on  Iraq  must  conform  with  international  law  -  and  most fundamentally the international legal principles alive in the UN Charter.

Iraq represents a major challenge for the UN multilateral system today. It is a major  challenge  to  the  UN  Security  Council.  And  the  UN  Security  Council must rise to the occasion.

Australia  must  continue  to  play  its  part  in  this  important  multilateral enterprise.  Security in the Middle East and the broader security of the world in large part hangs on that.

Australia  has  a  long  history  of  robust  engagement  in  and  through  the  UN system. This must be sustained on the question of Iraq as well. But both in our dealings with the United Nations and in our dealings with the United States, as a nation we must equally be conscious of the limitations on our resources.

The truth of the matter is that we are a small country. We are a population of 20 million people in a region of 3.5 billion. We have a 37,000km long coastline. And  have  an  economy  slightly  smaller  than  that  of  the  Kingdom  of  the Netherlands.

And  geo-strategically  we  lie  at  the  crossroads  of  South  East  Asia  and  the South  West  Pacific,  which,  for  the  first  time  in  a  quarter  of  a  century,  face grave challenges to their stability and security.

Australia must remain a committed and effective member of the US alliance.

Australia  must  also  remain  a  committed  and  effective  member  of  the  UN system.

Australia must equally recognise, however, that our first responsibility must be the security and stability of our own immediate region.

This is what the Australian people have entrusted to us.

And we must honour that trust.
