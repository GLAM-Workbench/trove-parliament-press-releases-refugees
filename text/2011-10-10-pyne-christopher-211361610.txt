SUBJECTS: Next federal election; political positions; Malaysia Solution; carbon tax

E&OE…

Peter Van Onselen: Mr Pyne thanks for your company.

Christopher Pyne: Good to be with you, Peter.

Van Onselen: Are you worried that when you’re Manager of Government Business,  assuming that the polls are accurate, things are going to be pretty nasty from the other side of  the house, the current Government, given the way that you’re treating them now?

Pyne: I think it depends on who the next Manager of Opposition Business is, but I don’t  count my chickens before they hatch.  That’s a very dangerous thing to do in politics.  I’m not  assuming that we have the next election in the bag.  There’s a long way to go before polling  day.  I think we’re obviously in poll position at the moment because the Government is so  bad and so divided and trying to introduce a carbon tax and can’t resolve their border  protection woes and so on.

This is a hung parliament, which makes it very difficult, but if we are lucky enough to win  the next election and fortunate enough to get the people’s support, I hope that I will be the  Leader of the House.  Whoever the Manager of Opposition Business is I shall treat them as  kindly as Anthony Albanese has treated me.

Van Onselen: You may not want to argue that you’re avoiding hubris let’s not put it that  way.  But let’s be honest, you concede for the Government to win the next election, it would  be the single greatest comeback in Australian political history?

Pyne: Well, Peter, nobody realised that the Government would be so foolish as to neck a  Prime Minister.  If they neck a second Prime Minister I think they’ll throw up their hands in  horror and say let’s get some adults in the room to run the country because at the moment  confidence is very low, people are very concerned and everyone is holding onto their money  because they are worried about what’s going to happen under this Government.

Van Onselen: Hence my question in fairness.  You talk about removing another Prime  Minister.  It feeds into the woes, whether it’s a perception or a reality of what’s happening.   You’d agree for them to lose the next election would be the biggest and most painful defeat  in the history of Australian politics?

Pyne: If the poll were to be believed and if there were an election this Saturday, then the  Government would very much struggle to win, but as you would well know in politics hubris  is a poison and we are just getting on with the job of presenting as an alternative Government  that has the unity, the stability and the policies to become a reasonable Government should  we be lucky enough to win.  I hope the Government will hold an election.  They should hold  one because they are introducing a carbon tax they don’t have a mandate for, but that’s really  in their boat.  We just have to keep going on with our campaign ensuring we hold this  Government to account because that’s what our supporters expect and judging by the on the  ground evidence that I pick up people are very much wanting a change of government and an  election.

Van Onselen: Well, the Opposition are very much wanting this election.  You’ve just said it.   It’s said repeatedly by Mr Abbott.  If that’s the case, shouldn’t you have more policies good  to go now so that the public and indeed commentators have more time to pick over them and  work out whether they’re viable or not?

Pyne: Well, there are a couple of points to be made there.  Number one, every policy we took  to the last election - there were 314 policies - remains current until that policy is changed so  if there was an election tomorrow, we would be in a position to implement a program.   Putting those specific policies to one side though, I think the Australian public know that the  Liberal Party has had basically the same principals for 60 years.  We believe in strong border  protection, we want to balance the budget, we believe in spending cuts to take pressure off  interest rates, to take pressure off inflation and to lower the Australian dollar and we believe  in a strong US Alliance.

Our basic platforms have always been the same and the Australian public know that.  They  know we’re not going to go on frolics that the public don’t regard as high order issues.  They  know we’re interested in the cost of living because most of us with families and those of us  who are seeing what’s happening in our electorate know that people are concerned about the  prices of fruit, vegetables, electricity, gas and so on and the carbon tax is only going to add to  that.  Our principals are the same and the public know what they are.

Van Onselen: You mention principals.  Let’s go back to political philosophy for a moment  before we get back to some of the particulars that are in the debate this week, carbon tax and  so forth.  You’re considered to be by a lot of people a Liberal moderate.  Firstly is that true  and secondly if it is what are the sort of issues you see yourself as being moderate on rather  than “Capital C” conservative?

Pyne: Look, Peter, I just see myself as a sensible member of the Parliamentary Party.  I don’t  attach tags to myself or my colleagues.  Certainly on some issues I’m closer to the centre of  the political spectrum than to the right.

Van Onselen: So what are some examples.  Give us a few?

Pyne: Well, for example I believe in an Australian head of state.  So I’m a republican.   Obviously Tony Abbott and I don’t share that view, he’s still a strong Monarchist but we  work extremely well together we’re very close friends we don’t have to agree on everything.

Van Onselen: Let’s look at that subject then. How passionate are you about an Australian  Head of State, how prepared are you going to be in Government to take your leader on about  getting a referendum sooner rather than later?

Pyne: Well look I believe very fervently that every Australian should have the capacity to be  the Head of State, the opportunity to be the Head of State which they don’t have at the  moment but it’s very much a second order issue, I’m just giving you an example of an issue  which I’m probably closer to the centre than to the right.

Van Onselen:  OK so we’ve got a second order issue that you’re closer to the centre rather  than the right, what about a first order issue because let’s face it, I’m being fair here you are  widely regarded as one of the leading moderates in the Liberal Party, as one of the leading  moderates what’s a first order issue that you’re moderate on?

Pyne: Look Peter as much as I would love to give you and the media ammunition to say that  there are splits in the Coalition, I’ve been around long enough to know that…

Van Onselen: This isn’t about splits it’s about whether you can pick issues that define who  you are which is the way everything that gets written about you defines who you are which is  being moderate. I’ve had other moderates in the Liberal party tell me how there’s a lot more  personnel at the top ranks that are now part of the party, yourself, Hockey, George Brandis  the list does go on but what I haven’t had any moderates do is tell me what the issues are that  these senior moderates are actually changing the direction of a very conservative Liberal  Party at the moment.

Pyne: Well I don’t think we’re any more conservative today than we’ve ever been. I mean  we very much represent both the liberal and  conservative strains of philosophical tradition in  the Westminster system. That’s one of the reasons we’ve been in Government for 40 of the  last 60 years. The Australian public share our values generally; they’re not socialists, so if  you’re talking philosophically obviously the Coalition is an amalgam of different views on  different things. I am one of those people, on life issues for example, euthanasia, embryonic  stem cell research, you would have to say that I have a pretty conservative view of things and  I have a very good voting record on those issues if you agree with that position. But on other  things, I don’t believe in government not playing a roll and ensuring those people who are  finding it tougher to get support, I believe very fervently in the safety net and that those  people who need more assistance to get the same opportunities that I’ve had for example  should be given that assistance. I’m not in favour of cutting programs that are targeted  assistance to people for example from low socio economic status background in the education

portfolio or from Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander background, people who speak English  as a second language at home, people with literacy and numeracy issues, in all those areas I  would be - and I’m sure I would have the support of my colleagues - somebody who  believes government has a roll to play.

Van Onselen: OK but would you agree, and this is a criticism of, if you like, the left within  both major parties, would you agree that since 2001, vis-a-vis Tampa when a number of  moderates were quite outspoken at various moments before being shut down about concerns  about treatment of asylum seekers, on that particular issue whether you’re in the left of the  Labor Party or a small L Liberal in the Liberal Party there seems to be a pretty broad  consensus these days which is capital C conservative on how to deal with asylum seekers.

Pyne: Well I think that’s a very good issue you’ve raised because it highlights how the  Liberal Party, with many liberals in it, and conservatives, believe in a border protection  policy that has protections for asylum seekers. One of the splits in the Government at the  moment between us and the Government is that Labor wants to send including the Labor left,  they want to send unaccompanied minors and other asylum seekers to Malaysia which has no  protection.

Van Onselen: And I think that is a disgrace I agree with you.

Pyne: It is.

Van Onselen: But I also think it’s a disgrace that you want to tow boats back to Indonesia  which equally doesn’t have protections. Indonesia not only isn’t a signatory to the UN  Conventions that Malaysia isn’t but there’s not even a non legally binding agreement in place  there which there at least is for Malaysia.

Pyne: But in the Howard Government the Liberals in the party managed to do a number of  things, one of those was to get children out of detention. When we lost Government in 2007  Peter, there were no children in detention and there were only four other people in detention.

Van Onselen: You’d concede that took years and years for that to happen?

Pyne: But hang on, also when we set up the Nauru processing centre and Manus Island a  number of basic protections were put in place and the UNHCR did the processing with the  Government of asylum seekers, now that showed that the Liberal and Conservative strains of  the Liberal Party understood how important it was for individuals who are reasonably  defenceless to have protections as well as being processed, about whether they should come  to Australia or not - 43 percent came to Australia, 57 percent didn’t. Under this Government,  under the Labor Government we are in the extraordinary situation where people like Melissa  Parkes who was a human rights lawyer for the United Nations is voting on Thursday for  children to be sent to Malaysia which is neither a signatory to the UN Convention nor has any  protections been put in place to ensure that those people are given the same kind of support  that they would have had if they were sent to Nauru.

Van Onselen: Let’s move on. The contemporary debate over the carbon tax that is going on,  now it’s no secret that you were pretty close to Malcolm Turnbull; you were one of his  lieutenants. You managed to re-craft yourself and be a key person around Tony Abbott as  well, what about the issue though, that fact that he was fundamentally in favour of an ETS  which was not that different in its fixed price on carbon to this particular scheme yet now the  entire centre of the universe in this debate between the government and the opposition is  about how bad the carbon tax is.

Pyne: Well I remain a good friend of Malcolm Turnbull, I wasn’t an old friend, I have  remained a friend and I have always been a good friend of Tony Abbott’s.

Van Onselen: Just not a policy friend of Malcolm Turnbull anymore, on this particular issue

Pyne: I remain a friend of Malcolm Turnbull on all fronts. Can I just say in terms of Malcolm  Turnbull’s position on the Emissions Trading Scheme that I supported as a member of his  front bench and I supported it genuinely as well, even if I hadn’t been a member of his front  bench. That changed when Copenhagen failed to reach any agreement internationally. We are  now in a position where we are in the post Copenhagen world and no other country is  introducing an economy wide carbon tax.

Van Onselen: Ok I accept that but I can’t entirely let you off on that because Malcolm  Turnbull was prepared as you were and other members of the Coalition were to pass the ETS  before Copenhagen; there was an opportunity then to say no, now that’s what the Abbott  forces ended up doing. But the Turnbull forces if you like of which you were a part, were  advocating at the time to pass it before Copenhagen. Now Greg Hunt told us on this  programme the other week that that for him was essentially, and I don’t think I am verballing  him, that it was essentially for him a loyalty to Turnbull than the policy itself, was that the  same for you?

Pyne: I believed that we should pass the ETS before Copenhagen and I believed that  Copenhagen would reach some kind of international agreement. I was absolutely sure that the  rest of the world would move on an Emissions Trading Scheme or some kind of programme  for dealing with emissions. I was as shocked as anybody that Copenhagen was so manifestly  unsuccessful, but it was manifestly unsuccessful. We are now in a position where even  George Osborn, the Chancellor of the Exchequer in Brittan is saying that Brittan won’t ruin  their economy in order to move further ahead then the rest of the world with respect to  reducing their emissions and they account for 2% of the world emissions. Now we have to  deal with the reality with the current situation. Australia is the only country that is  introducing an economy wide carbon tax, we have the alternative of Tony Abbott’s Direct  action plan which would achieve the same outcome without destroying the manufacturing  sector, the steel industry, the coal industry and pushing up electricity prices by at least 10%.

And if beggar’s belief Peter that the Labor party would be so stubborn, so proud, that they  would refuse to accept that they are instituting policy that is going to wreck the economy,  cost jobs, destroy communities. They should be hanging their heads in shame that they passed  this Bill this afternoon because far from delivering an achievement as Greg Combet keeps  trying to tell us, it is actually the end of the duplicity in the House of Representatives before  tomorrow morning because they lied to the Australian people before the election that they

wouldn’t introduce it. The only mandate that this government has is not to introduce a carbon  tax and that’s why we are back at the same point that we must have an election so the public  can have the final say.

Van Onselen: And presumably that’s also partly why they have so woeful polling numbers.  But when you say that you were shocked, manifestly shocked that Copenhagen would fail as  it did, maybe we have found something that you really are a true moderate on because I have  never had any faith in international systems or organizations being able to achieve consensus  outcomes. I had no faith that Copenhagen would be able to. You can’t be serious, that you  were so naÃÂ¯ve, someone who is as well read as you are on foreign affairs that you didn’t think  that that would be a failure as a conference, you must have realised it was a tough one?

Pyne: Well most commentators around the world were indicating, even people in the Chinese  government were indicating that they would go to Copenhagen with good faith to bring about  an outcome. The United States said it, Europe said it, and we said and so did most of the  other third world or developing countries. It was manifestly derailed for a whole host of  reasons, but once it was derailed, the circumstances changed. And Australia is now acting  alone and all this carbon tax will do is export our emissions, export our jobs and cost  Australian familles their livehoods, and it’s quite frankly vandalism for the government to go  ahead with it knowing as they do what we all know.

Van Onselen: one final quick question before we let you go Mr Pyne. Do you concede that if  you win the next election that it is more likely to be because of problems in the government  rather than great alternatives from the opposition? I know that you have alternate polices, that  there are a number that the leadership group are passionate about, but do you agree with the  old adage that it’s not oppositions that win elections it’s governments that losses them?

Pyne: Well I think the public will make an assessment on Election Day that the Liberal party  is a better party to manage the economy, that they are a better party to reduce cost of living  pressures, interest rates, inflation and the Australian dollar. That they are a better party to  protect our borders, to ensure that we don’t have to cut defence spending because of this  governments profligate spending, to assure that we have a strong alliance with the United  States and that we are working with our partners in Asia, like Indonesia, like Malaysia,  Thailand and at the moment the government is busily trashing all of those relationships.
