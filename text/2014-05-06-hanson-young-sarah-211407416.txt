Tony’s tow-backs take a sinister turn  The Indonesian Navy’s report that the Australian Government has loaded more people onto a  refugee boat before towing it back to Indonesia is very concerning, the Australian Greens have said.

“Under Tony Abbott’s watch, the Australian Government has been turned into a people smuggler,”  the Greens’ immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.

“This ridiculous and dangerous behaviour will only jeopardise the fragile relationship with Indonesia  even further.

“No one expected much from Tony Abbott’s diplomatic abilities but, if this is his version of a ‘Jakarta  focussed’ government, then our closest political relationships are clearly in trouble.

“The Abbott Government cannot keep hiding behind Operation Blame the Soldiers. It has to be up  front with the Australian people and explain what it’s doing on the high seas.

“If people were loaded onto this boat before it was towed back into the open ocean and left to run  aground in Indonesia, the government will have some serious questions to answer.

“Australian service people and refugees are being put at risk by the Abbott Government’s extreme  policies.”
