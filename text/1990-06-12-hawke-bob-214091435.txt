12 June 1990.

Prime Minister Bob Hawke made certain remarks today about the  Government's intention about PRC nationals' future status in  A ustralia,

We are confused by the Prime Minister's statement, and are yet to  see what the details will be.

There about 10,000 PRC nationals who have lodged their

applications for residence and refugee status and have been  experiencing considerable difficulty in the past year. We certainly  do not wish to see this condition prolong.

The NUCSS will hold a press conference at 10.30 am ,W ed, 13  June 1990, in Committee Room 5, House of Representatives  Side, Parliam ent House, to give a detailed and comprehensive  response to the Prime Minister's statement on12 June that none of  the 17,000 PRC nationals in Australia at 20 June last year will be  granted permanent residence.
