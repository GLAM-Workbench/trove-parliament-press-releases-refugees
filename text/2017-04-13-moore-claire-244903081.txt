TURNBULL GOVERNMENT FAILS GLOBAL COMMUNITY ON DEVELOPMENT  ASSISTANCE

Labor is deeply concerned by new research confirming Australia is falling further in  world rankings for overseas development assistance.

At a time when Africa is again facing a devastating famine, and the Syrian conflict has  created an international refugee crisis, the OECD’s reporting is deeply  disappointing, showing Australian development assistance fell by 12.7% in real terms in  2016.

Analysis by the ANU’s Development Policy Centre shows Australia has dropped one  place in the OECD rankings on development assistance volume, and dropped three  places, to 17th on development assistance effort.

The OECD data shows development assistance fell in seven countries, with Australia  recording one of the largest decreases in the developed world.

The Turnbull Government’s cuts to development assistance are a source of  international embarrassment for Australia, and at odds with the generous spirit of the  Australian people.

The 2016-17 Budget delivered the weakest levels of Australian development assistance in  history, spending just 23 cents in every $100 of our national income on foreign aid.

Over the next decade this will get even worse, with the Turnbull Government’s budget  figures forecasting our international development program will fall to just 0.17 per cent  of GNI.

The Abbott/Turnbull Government has abandoned Australia’s bipartisan commitment to  GNI growth, overseeing a 24.2% cut to the development budget since 2013.

Theresa May's recent commitment to enshrine Britain’s aid commitment in legislation shows  international development can be bipartisan and doesn't have to be a progressive/conservative  issue.

Britain’s commitment was made possible by genuine and sustained support from  administrations on both sides of politics in the UK, just as it could be here.
