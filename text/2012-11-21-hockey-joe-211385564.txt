THE HON JOE HOCKEY MP

SHADOW TREASURER

DOORSTOP  PARRAMATTA

WEDNESDAY 21 NOVEMBER 2012



E&OE………………………………………………………………………………………

JOE HOCKEY:

It is terrific to be here in Parramatta with Martin and Senator Marise Payne. This is one of the  seats that needs to change hands at the next election if we are going to have a change of  Government. Quite clearly - even just by meeting with some business-people this morning - it  is obvious there is a general malaise around in the business community.

The fact that the Coalition partners of the Labor Party - Rob Oakeshott and some of the  others - are raising an expansion of the GST or an increase in the GST says everything about  the default position of the Labor Party, the Greens and the independents; that is to tax people  more - whether it be the mining tax or the GST.

The bottom line is that Labor spends and wastes too much money and that is why they always  need to go back to higher taxes. The general malaise amongst small business-people is  closely associated with a Government that keeps changing the rules.

The Coalition, under no circumstances, will support any changes to the mining tax - we want  to get rid of it. It was a stupid tax in the first place, it hardly raises a dollar and now the  mining tax is ‘exhibit A’ on the incompetence of this Government. The fact they have  allocated $15 billion of expenditure against a tax that hardly raises a dollar says everything  about the economic incompetence of Labor and the fact they have no taxation plan and they  have no economic plan. All they do is they have a plan to make things harder and not easier  for business. Any questions?

JOURNALIST:

In terms of polling around Parramatta, what is your internal polling saying about how  successful you will be?

JOE HOCKEY:

We don’t disclose internal polling. Frankly, there is no doubt that in Western Sydney people  want a change. They want to get rid of a bad Government. They want to get rid of the Labor  Party. The Labor Party brand is toxic in New South Wales and you just need to look at Eddie  Obeid and look at what is happening at ICAC and you can identify that the Labor Party does  not represent the aspirations of everyday Australians and certainly not the aspirations of  everyday people in Western Sydney.

JOURNALIST:

Were the Local Government elections in Western Sydney results heartening for the Liberal  Party?

JOE HOCKEY:

I have no doubt that there is a mood for change in Western Sydney. I have no doubt that  people want to get rid of Labor. I have no doubt about that. They want the chance to reboot  the economy, to reboot the message of hope - and it is only the Liberal Party that can deliver  that.

JOURNALIST:

There was also a lot of speculation and talk about Liberal Party branch stacking in Western  Sydney branches during those elections. Is that something the Liberal Party is worried about?  Do you think that will raise its head again? [inaudible]

JOE HOCKEY:

No. We have a candidate in Parramatta. Martin is our candidate in Parramatta. From our  perspective he is a very good candidate, an outstanding candidate, and someone who I am  very proud to be standing next to, to walk into business with, to walk into people’s homes  and say ‘vote for this man. He will be a strong, competent, fearless representative for the  people of the community’.

JOURNALIST:

But have you spoken to those branches on a lower level?

JOE HOCKEY:

No. They are matters for the Party. If there is branch stacking, it won’t work in the Liberal  Party, full stop.

JOURNALIST:

Reports today that the Federal Government is cutting money to chemotherapy drugs. Are you  surprised that of all the areas to find money this would be one area?

JOE HOCKEY:

It doesn’t surprise me. When it comes to the Labor Party, they are happy to hand out  hundreds of millions of dollars to businesses in the motor industry or others, and the money  is, at times, wasted. They are happy to spend money on giving $900 cheques to dead people,  or pink batts or school hall programs which they massively overspent on. The Labor Party  knows how to waste money, they don’t know how to be careful with money and they never  give money the priority it deserves such as helping people who are undergoing  chemotherapy. I just find it astounding that the Labor Party would do that but the amount of  waste in the Government means they are running out of money.

See, every time they run out of money they keep going back to the tax-well. Sooner or later,  the tax-well is empty. They are discovering that on the mining tax - that is why the GST  keeps coming up. Now the bottom line is you have to stop the waste. If you can stop the  waste then you can do something about it. And, by the way, stop the boats. We now have had  over 30,000 people come by boat to Australia, unlawfully, since Kevin Rudd changed the  rules - over 30,000 people seeking refugee status coming to Australia by boat over the last  four and a half years. That compares to 300 people in the last six years of the Coalition  Government. Each boat is costing $13 million for processing. Fair dinkum, if you want to see  waste, then have a look at that.

JOURNALIST:

How much is the Budget relying on the proceeds from the wireless spectrum that we now  know the Communications Minister wants to set the price for instead of ACMA?

JOE HOCKEY:

I don’t think it has actually been identified in the Budget. It doesn’t surprise me that the  Government is obfuscating about the real costs of some of its spectrum sales. They are doing  anything, they are selling anything, they are taxing anything. Understand this, when the  Labor Party borrows money, they are borrowing tomorrow’s tax. When they introduce a new  tax they are taking more tax today. In the last session of Parliament they introduced $6 billion  of retrospective taxes. They have taken a special dividend out of the Reserve Bank, a special  dividend out of Medibank Private, special dividends out of Australia Post. They are searching  everywhere  for the dollars to fill their gaps. In the meantime they have over $120 billion  worth of promises they cannot fund. Selling an asset is a one off. It should be used to reduce  the debt which is about $250 billion. Selling assets to pay for today’s bills is not the answer.

JOURNALIST:

Should the Communications Minister be intervening?

JOE HOCKEY:

I’d like to see the details of it and I am sure my colleague, Malcolm Turnbull, will have more  to say about that.

JOURNALIST:

Are the Liberal Party’s policies costed? How will you pay for super increases and parental  leave?

JOE HOCKEY:

Let me just say this, the Government’s changes to superannuation are meant to be funded by  a mining tax that hardly raises a dollar. The Government’s Schoolkids Bonus is meant to be  funded by a mining tax that hardly raises a dollar. Instant asset write off for small business is  funded by a mining tax that hardly raises a dollar. We have already said we will make hard  decisions, including about the size of the public service in Canberra, which we have said that  - through natural attrition - over two years, will mean a 12,000 reduction. We have already  announced that we can’t proceed with the Schoolkids Bonus, we have already announced that  there is a number of initiatives that we cannot fund because the money isn’t there. Therefore  the things that we do promise will be fully funded.

JOURNALIST:

The RBA minutes were suggesting that the carbon tax was perhaps putting more pressure on  inflation than the Governnent was suggesting. Does this vindicate the Coalition’s argument  then?

JOE HOCKEY:

Absolutely. The Reserve Bank in its statement, previous to this week, said that the full impact  of the carbon tax is still to flow through to the economy. Now, of course, the carbon tax is  going to make life more expensive. Of course the carbon tax is going to make it harder to cut  interest rates if inflation is going up - even though the carbon tax is meant to be a one off -  but the flow through impacts are significant.

You walked with me through those shops and they all talked with me about how they are  having to pay more, they are being squeezed, all their costs are going up. They can’t pass  them onto the consumers because the consumers are already tied down. There are small  business-people here in Parramatta saying that their costs have gone up. It all comes back to  the fact that the carbon tax is a tax on everything - it flows through to everything. It is a  heavy burden on these businesses.

JOURNALIST:

Just regarding Rob Oakeshott’s comments on the GST. He says he has been told privately by  senior figures in both parties that they would like to make changes. Are you one of those  people?

JOE HOCKEY:

No. I think Rob Oakeshott is making it up. He can feel free to name it, but I am the guy who  is in charge of Coalition tax policy. I am saying emphatically - emphatically - that we are not  going to change the GST. You have just got to walk through some of the shops here in  Parramatta to know that people are already struggling with a high cost of living. Increasing  the cost of living with additional taxes would be like a baseball bat to consumer confidence.  It just shows you that Rob Oakeshott is just trying to be relevant as he is becoming  increasingly irrelevant.

JOURNALIST:

Are you confident that you will be able to roll back the carbon tax?

JOE HOCKEY:

Yes. Absolutely.

JOURNALIST:

What will your party do about climate change?

JOE HOCKEY:

We have a Direct Action plan on climate change, which we have already announced. We will  add to it further before the next election.
