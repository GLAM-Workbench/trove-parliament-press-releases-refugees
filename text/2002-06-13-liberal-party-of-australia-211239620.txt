MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS HON ALEXANDER DOWNER, MP

TRANSCRIPT

DATE: 13 June 2002 VENUE: Electorate Office, Stirling, SA TITLE: Nauru

Question: Minister, we have seen the UN reject quite a few of these Tampa boat people, obviously the circumstances have changed in their home country, what’s it say about the policy? Mr Downer: I think this simply underlines how right the Government has been to take a strong stand on illegal migration. The UN has found, of the people it has recently processed in Nauru, that all but 25 of those people are not refugees. And the simple fact is that if the Government had taken a weak stand, and just allowed anybody to come to Australia who wanted, without any visa, we would have ended up with a very major problem to try to address. We appreciate the support that Australia has been given by Nauru and by Papua New Guinea in this process. But the large number of people who have been found - not just by Australian authorities but by the UN - not to be refugees, simply vindicates the Government’s position. Question: They’re saying that of course the Taliban was still in power at the time they left and, ergo, they would have still been in danger, a lot of them and now the situation has changed. Mr Downer: Well, to be frank with you, I have been to Nauru and I’ve spoken to some of these people myself. And they have all sorts of theories and explanations as to why they should come to Australia and I don’t want to canvass all those theories and all those explanations, and I don’t want to say anything about those people and their applications, excepting that we do have due process for considering people who wish to migrate to Australia or come as part of our established refugee resettlement program. People who try to circumvent our due processes are people who are going to get themselves into some difficulty. The Australian Government takes a strong stand against people who try to come here illegally and takes a very generous, positive and forthright approach to people who wish to come to Australia legally. Question: The UNHCR says that they shouldn’t be sent back home despite the fact that their applications have been rejected. Mr Downer: The UNHCR has said, and this is an important point this, the UNHCR - and they are reflecting the views of the interim government in Afghanistan - has said that they don’t want people forced back to Afghanistan. But, of course, quite a number of people have gone back to Afghanistan, for example in the last month or so around a hundred or so Afghanis have gone back to Afghanistan from Indonesia. And we would encourage people who have been

found to be illegal migrants, who are from Afghanistan, we would encourage them to return to Afghanistan as soon as they can. But, forcing them to go back is something we wouldn’t do at this stage but we’d certainly be encouraging them and the Government has a scheme in place whereby each individual will be provided with $2000 and families up to $10,000 to encourage them to return home. Question: Will they be left on Nauru pending their appeals or will they come to Australia? Mr Downer: No they will remain - if they wish to appeal because I don’t know if they will or not, I can’t make a judgement about whether they’ll appeal obviously - but it they appeal they’ll obviously remain in Nauru pending their appeals. Hopefully the appeals will be conducted very quickly. Question: What will be your discussions, then, with Mr Harris tomorrow? Mr Downer: My discussion with Mr Harris is for us particularly to work through the aid program and to take him through the details of how we’ve been spending that money. I have some officials from Ausaid, including the Director General of Ausaid, meeting with President Harris in Melbourne today and they’re going through the fine detail of the aid program with him there. Then tomorrow I’ll be able to cap that all off by talking about the aid program and how that’s panning out under the Memorandum of Understanding and original agreement signed by President Harris and Peter Reith. Question: How popular is this $2000 golden handshake? Mr Downer: Mr Ruddock is really the person to talk to about that - it has only just been introduced, so I am not sure that we are in a position to make any judgement about it at this stage, it’ll take a bit more time before we can make that assessment. In any case, in relation to the people on Nauru, they had lodged applications for refugee status, and they’re weren’t of course going to accept this offer before those applications had been considered and processed, so some of them might appeal but once all the processes are completed they might find this a very constructive solution to their problem. Question: Have you got any promises for Nauru about how long those that are there will stay? Mr Downer: There are two things to say about that. Our position all along has been, since I signed the Memorandum of Understanding with President Harris, that we’d process people as quickly as possible and the people would leave Nauru, either if they are found to be illegal migrants to return back to their homes, or else they are found to be refugees - which of course has turned out not to be very many of them - then resettlement arrangements will be made for them and we’re in the process of doing that. President Harris is not saying to me, or has not said to me, “please get these people off Nauru.” He’s said to me that we just need to have a clear understanding of what the formula is for how the processing is working and how long that takes. Now, President Harris has been in Australia for a little while. During his time in Australia obviously he hasn’t been able to meet with our officials who are on the ground in Nauru. This is an opportunity for us to take President Harris through some of the details of how the processing is all working. Question:

Will the Government be providing more support, potentially, for Nauru? Mr Downer: No, not over and above what we have provided in the Memorandum of Understanding. We are not offering to provide more support over and above that - at least in terms of dollars and cents. Whether there can be or their should be any changes made to the programs, that’s a matter for discussion, he’s not particularly lobbying on that, but I don’t want to say we would never change the nature of any program in any circumstances. If he asked us to, that’s a hypothetical question, but if he did ask us to we’d obviously look at that. Question: What’s your comment on New Zealand where applications were processed much more quickly and most people were accepted as refugees? Mr Downer: If you’re comparing the New Zealand system of processing with the UNHCR system that’s a matter you can take up with the New Zealanders and the United Nations High Commission for Refugees. Question: Have you had any comfirmation of reports that a boat carrying asylum seekes has sunk? Mr Downer: Absolutely no confirmation at all, we have no information on that. Before I came out to speak with you I checked with our intelligence agencies, we have no information as of now, as of the middle of today, about any boat having sunk. I have seen a report in the media, I understand though that the report is based on somebody in the Indonesian military telling the journalist that this may or could have happened, not that it has happened. Question: Do you think that given this UN ruling that fewer people will wish to make that long journey from Afghanistan or elsewhere to Australia in the future? Mr Downer: Absolutely and clearly fewer people are making the journey to try to get to Australia. Look the Australian Government has taken a tough stand on people coming here illegally. We have a welcoming and positive approach to people who wish to migrate legally to Australia or to come as part of our refugee resettlement program. But we are very tough on people who try to get here illegally and on people smugglers who are trying to accumulate personal wealth on the back of who they mislead into believing that they can get into Australia illegally. We have taken a tough stand on that and increasingly, of course, countries around the world recognise that the approach we have taken has been effective - I can’t claim in the future it will always be perfectly effective but it’s been pretty effective and certainly a lot, lot more effective than the position other countries have been taking in the past, or the position we used to take in the past. So it’s an approach that’s been effective and I think there is a lot of interest in Europe about how we’ve made this work so well. But of course remember, Australia is an island, so it is easier to run a tough policy like this than if you’re not an island - it’s obviously more difficult for some of the European countries. Question: The Afghan consul has offered to go and visit the refugees…the assulum seekers in Nauru…would you or the Government countenance that? Mr Downer: Well I heard him actually on the radio but he hasn’t approached us, I’ve only heard some comments in the media. I don’t really know enough about what he would have in mind to be able to make a judgement about that. And obviously visits to Nauru aren’t ultimately a matter

Inquiries:  (02) 6277 7500

for the Australian Government, they’re a matter for the Nauruan Government so he’d have to take it up with them as well as us. Question: But would you support such a visit? Mr Downer: I’m agnostic about it, I don’t really have enough information on what he’d really want to do. He was talking about brokering some sort of a deal.  But I wasn’t sure who he was brokering the deal between and why brokering is the issue.  I think the issue is that those people who are found not to be refugees should  return home. Question: Are you still a strong supporter of the International Criminal Court. Mr Downer: Look, nothing as far as I’m concerned has changed on this issue.  There is a fairly open debate in the Government parties about this issue, and so there should be, because it’s an important issue.  People have different views, and they have quite strong views on it.  What I’ve always said right from the time I became Foreign Minister is we shouldn’t rush off and ratify treaties and conventions of one kind or another in secret, that we should have due process, there should be parliamentary scrutiny wherever possible of conventions and treaties that the Government may wish to sign and this is just part and parcel of that process and once that process is complete then the Government will make a final decision on whether we will go ahead and ratify and if we do,  how we will ratify.  So you know, there’s a little bit of water to go under the bridge, I wouldn’t get too excited about it. Question: Is it fair to say the Government’s going a bit cold on the idea though? Mr Downer: No, it’s not fair to say anything beyond what I’ve said.  I think it’s fair to say there are differences of view particularly in the Parliamentary Party, and I think they’ve been aticulated through the media and I think from my own experience of the Liberal Party which is very long, and deep experience of the Liberal Party, it’s enormously important to allow Members of Parliament and Senators to air their views.  I mean the Liberal Party is not like the old Communist Party of the Soviet Union, or the Labor Party perhaps in some guises on some occasions, it is a party which does allow Members of Parliament who have been democratically elected by the people of Australia to express their views and to play a part in Government decision making and they’re perfectly entitled to to express their views and this is a discussion which takes place without any animosity in the Party. Question: So to confirm, you have been a strong supporter.  Yes or No you are you still a strong supporter? Mr Downer: Well I, as I said yesterday, I agree with what I say. That is, I’ve made a lot of statements in the past and I still agree with the statements  I made. I agree with me (laughs). Question: Is the job of convincing your colleagues of the merits of the court becoming harder? Mr Downer: People have different views about these issues. You know, one of the things you’ve got to take into account in this country is that we’ve had United Nations committees not properly resourced, make statements often which are just factually incorrect. There has been a lot of irritation in the Australian community about some of the lecturing we’ve had from some

agencies of the United Nations. Now , whilst the International Criminal Court, would not be a United Nations agency, this has led people to question more carefully Australia’s engagement with multi-lateral diplomacy. It is not that people are against engagement with multi-lateral diplomacy, but the important thing to understand here is that multi-lateral diplomacy has to be made to work for Australia. And this naturally enough generates worthy and significant discussion whenever we move toward signing or ratifying any international agreement of this kind. So that is the context of it and people are absolutely welcome to express views. This is a liberal democracy. I am very proud of that and I am very happy for people to express their views on this issue. Question: Are there any grounds for concerns that Australian peacekeepers could be dragged before a war crimes court? Mr Downer: Well, no there aren’t.
