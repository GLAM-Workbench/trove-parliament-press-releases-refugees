RICHARD KING:       And in town today for a number of matters is the Federal Minister  for Sport and also the Minister for Multicultural Affairs Senator Kate Lundy, and the  Senator is on the line right now. Good morning Minister.

KATE LUNDY:          Good morning.

RICHARD KING:       Well, you're in our neck of the woods, and I believe first off  heading, Kate, to have a look at what will be one of the venues for the January 2015  Asia Cup, the Hunter Stadium. Gee, we're lucky we've got that venue in our neck of the  woods, otherwise the Asia Cup wouldn't be coming to town.

KATE LUNDY:          Look, it's a real credit to Newcastle, and we're very pleased as a  Federal Government to invest $10 million in it too. But we've also to managed to nail  some really great games in the Asia Football Cup, with a couple of group matches in the  semi-final and the a playoff between third and fourth, that's terrific.

RICHARD KING:       Yes, yeah, that will be fantastic. And, look, just mentioned with  Matt Gidley, Kate, the ASADA investigation, and I think you were there at that initial  press conference. I mean, it is dragging on and on and on. It would be nice if it could be  wrapped up quickly. I mean, at this stage it looks like it could go for the whole season at  the moment.

KATE LUNDY:          Look, you won't get any disagreement from me on that. The sooner  it's wrapped up, I think there’s universal agreement, the better. What ASADA obviously  needs now is cooperation from the clubs and the players through the course of their  investigation, and I'm advised that's the fastest way to get through this. But I think - the  other thing I'd say about it is I'm not able to provide commentary on the ongoing  investigation as it is part of an independent inquiry.

But, the whole issue of ethics in sport is really maturing in Australia and Project Aperio  and the Australian Crimes Commission report has raised a number of issues that I think  many people are concerned about, and I'm very focused on making sure that every  clean athlete and sportsperson in Australia can participate in their sport with confidence  that it is clean. So we will get through this, and Australian sport will be stronger for it.

RICHARD KING:      Yeah, hear, hear. Just back to the Asia Cup: I know when I went to  the launch a number of weeks ago it was pointed out that there would need to be  upgrades for the event prior to it happening. Will there be federal money forthcoming for  what's needed before we can host the Asia Cup?

KATE LUNDY:          Well, we, as I said, we are committing - we've committed $10  million towards Hunter Stadium, but also the Federal Government is contributing $30  million to the effort to host the Asian Football Cup in conjunction with the partner states.  So we're really, really pleased - we want to work closely with all of the regions who have  a role to play, who've won the right to host games, particularly for the tourism and the  legacy that it can bring to, you know, to our cities and states. And I think one of the  benefits of that is the inspiration it provides kids, so looking at community facilities  around soccer, and also the tourism benefits and the boost to local business. So they're  much more than just a sport itself, and I think Newscastle's got that loud and clear.

RICHARD KING:       The changes you announced recently made to sports funding by  the Federal Government a couple of weeks ago, sports funded by performance by the  Australian Sports Commission. I know a couple of locals, Nathan Outteridge and Iain  Jensen who won gold in the 49er class in London will be happy because sailing's getting  a bit more money, as is golf and rugby, but a number of others are not getting quite as  much, Kate.

KATE LUNDY:          It's a rebalancing that the Australian Sports Commission and the  AIS in particular have done with the Winning Edge. They're asking sports to be  accountable on performance for the funding they receive from the Federal Government,  from taxpayers, and those adjustments are reflected in the allocations to each of the  sports. I think the strength of the Winning Edge from the way the AIS has approached it  is that sports who can show they have a plan to deliver those very positive outcomes, to  deliver good results on behalf of their sports, are the ones that will be supported with  funding, and sports that are not able to demonstrate that have to work harder for their  money.

So it is an adjustment, but sports like sailing are proven. They've got fantastic  role models, like Iain and Nathan, I agree…

RICHARD KING:       Yes.

KATE LUNDY:          …and sailing's a sport too that is invested in the participation side,  and that's - I really commend them for what they've done with their Discover Sailing  program and package and so forth. So they're taking care of that participation side and  kids' involvement in their sport too, and that's very impressive.

RICHARD KING:       2HD, 12 to eight, I'm speaking with Senator Kate Lundy, the  Federal Minister for Sport and also Multicultural Affairs, and I'll get you to take the sport  hat off and put on the multicultural affairs hat, because you're also visiting today in  Newcastle the Northern Settlement Services, and I must be honest, I wasn't really sure  of the work that the Northern Settlement Services do, funded by your government. Can  you just explain what the settlements grant program is all about, and more particularly  the Northern Settlement Services, Kate?

KATE LUNDY:          Look, I certainly can. Look, Australia has such a proud record of  our successful diverse society, and how we invest in that is by supporting new arrivals,  new migrants to Australia. Many people come here, either through our humanitarian  program or our migration programs, and our settlement grants program offers support to  helping people settle successfully.

And, look, around the world a lot of people look at Australia and say how could  you possibly have settled seven million migrants peacefully since the end of World War  II, and why does it work so well in Australia? Well, one of the answers is these  community investments that we make through organisations like Northern Settlement  Services. They provide a great service, they support migrants and refugees integrating  into our community, making sure that they're able to build that sense of belonging and  find their feet in their new home, and it's a collective responsibility we have, but in my  portfolio federally a lot of those grant programs and project funding comes from my  portfolio.

RICHARD KING:       Alright. A couple of questions without notice, Minister, and a  couple of hot topics. Same-sex marriage - Tony Windsor suggesting we should have a  referendum on this and allow the populous to vote rather than our politicians. What's  your view on that one, Kate?

KATE LUNDY:          Look, ultimately it requires federal legislative change, so the  Parliament would have to decide on what legislative change arose from that referendum.  I'm of the view that I think the population has already indicated in whatever way that it  can, through polls and public opinion, that it is largely supportive of that change. I'm  proud to be part of a party that allows me to vote with my conscience on this issue, and  I'll continue to support that.

RICHARD KING:       And the other hot topic, the National Disability Insurance Scheme,  which is of course going to be trialled in Newcastle and the Hunter getting underway  very shortly. There was bipartisan support for it, but now it would appear that the funding  is going to be a little problematic and the Coalition suggesting that maybe rather than the  gold-plated version of the NDIS we go for the galvanised version. Obviously you're of the  opinion that the NDIS should be - you know, become a part of the Australian fabric by  hook or by crook, Senator?

KATE LUNDY:          Look, absolutely, and I think some things need to, you know, rise  above the challenges. We're very committed, despite very difficult fiscal circumstances  and declining revenues, that the NDIS is a priority for us as a nation. We are committed  to that. I don't want to second-guess the Prime Minister's announcement later today, as  some of the newspapers have, but I think it's a really exciting time. Labor is absolutely  committed to this reform, and people living with a disability and their families and carers  deserve this support and recognition. I'm really thrilled to hear that Newcastle is one of  the areas where it'll be implemented first.

RICHARD KING:       Yeah. Alright, thank you very much for your time, and of course  being the Minister for Sport you're going for a Knights win on Sunday, Kate?

KATE LUNDY:          [Laughs] I'll have to check my tips.

RICHARD KING:       [Laughs] Alright…

KATE LUNDY:          And good luck.

RICHARD KING:       Yeah, thank you, and thank you very much for your time this  morning, Minister.

KATE LUNDY:          Thank you so much.

RICHARD KING:       Senator Kate Lundy, Federal Minister for Sport and also  Multicultural Affairs, who's in town today.
