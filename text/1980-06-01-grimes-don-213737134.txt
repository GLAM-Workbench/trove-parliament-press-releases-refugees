PENSION LEVELS

Newspaper columnists with an eye on the Budget are telling  us that too much is spent on welfare. Pensioners with an  eye on the Budget are asking that pension levels be raised.

It is worth recalling the pension changes which took place  in the time of the Whitlam Labor Government and those which  have taken place under the Fraser Government. "

When Labor came to office on 2 December 1972 the standard  (or single) pension rate was $20 a week and it represented  19.7% of average weekly earnings. When we left office in  November 1975 the pension rate was $38.75 a week and

represented 23 .1% of average weekly earnings.

After the equivalent time in office, three years, the  Fraser Government had raised the pension to $53*20 a week,  Ã¢ÂÂ which was 24% of average weekly earnings. After more than  four years the Fraser Government pension stood at $57*90

a week, or just 23% of average weekly earnings (March 1980,  the last available date, shows average weekly earnings at  $250.90).

That is, in three years the Labor Government raised the  pension as a proportion of average weekly earnings from  19.7% to 23*1%, that is, 3*4%.

The Fraser Government, in over four years, has not raised  the pension as a percentage of average weekly earnings.

In Labor's time pensions rose twice as fast as the cost  of living. The standard pension rose by 93*75%> while  the cost of living rose 50%.

In Fraser's time pensions have lost ground. The pension  has gone up 49.4% while the cost of living has gone up 51.5%,  in the same period. Both in levels of pensions and services to pensioners

the Labor Government did more in three years than the  present Government has done in four and a half years.

ATTACK BY LIBERAL MINISTER

The Prime Minister is increasingly coming under attack from  its own side. The latest is Mr Brian Dixon, Victorian Housing  Minister. I quote from the Sun News Pictorial (25*6.1980):

"The Housing Minister, Mr Dixon, has strongly criticised  the Federal Government for failing to accept its responsibility  to meet the needs of low income earners. Mr Dixon also  accused the Government of allowing the 'increasingly poor  minority' in Australia to bear the burden of its spending

cutbacks... Mr Dixon said the Housing Commission was now  facing arrears in tenants' rent payments totalling almost million. He said most of the tenants involved could not  a^*orc* meet their rent bill because social security incomes  oniy partly covered food., and other essential .. costs."

HOW M A N Y  J O I t S  A WHK.lv?

On 23 May last SenatorÂ· Guilfoyle answered a question 1 had  asked on the number of* jobs an unemployed person had to  try for to prove he or she had been actively seeking work.

Her answer was a testimonial to her ignorance and that of  her public servants on the nature of jobs and the jobless. I quote from her long answer: ,

a local instruction issued in one State... has -   suggested that in some situations where good job  opportunities exist it might reasonably be expected  that contacts with prospective employers exceed, say, 7 a week.  However,  a decision is made in respect of

each individual in the light of the particular  circumstances of his case... the claimant may be asked  to produce any documentation he holds such as copies of  job applications or advices of unsuccessful applications..

These are ludicrous requirements.  The jobs are not there.   If the unemployed name the same seven every week they would  very likely find their benefit cut off. If they had to try  seven different places every week they would go mad -  over the average unemployment time of 30 weeks they would  have to travel to and ask at 210 different places.

The Department of Social Security provides no travel  vouchers,  no writing pads or stamps.  Senator Guilfoyle  hasn't explained how they are supposed to pay their own  travel expenses on an unemployment benefit of $51Â·  ^-5 a week

(19^,000 unemployed,  over 18 and without dependants); or  $36 a week (56,600 between l6 and 18 without dependants),  that is, if she still expects them to pay rent and eat.

As for documentation, that is a public service assumption.  When they make job applications they think of access to  typewriters and public service photocopiers. They do not  seem.to understand that most unemployed people inquire

at building sites, factory gates and from senior shop  assistants, and that employers have better things to do  than to write letters to prove that hundreds of people  had inquired about jobs that week.

As the public servants who framed that reply are out of  touch with reality,  the unemployed must hope that counter  and processing officers in the regional offices have  regard to the lack of work in their areas and not penalise

them if they cannot produce half a ton of documentation.

Senator Guilfoyle signs the answers to every question. If she truly believes those demands on the unemployed  are realistic she has not begun to understand the nature  of the problem.

EMERGENCY RELIEF

In the 1977 election campaign the Prime Minister announced  that $500,000 would be given to provide emergency aid for  the needy or people in unforeseen debt. It was considered  at the time a real breakthrough to have the Commonwealth  acknowledge some responsibility for the financial support  of people in trouble.  .

v

Voluntary agencies had been pressing for this on fhe grounds  that emergency payments were needed because it was Commonwealth  Government policy to keep social service payments at a low  level. The Commonwealth, therefore, should bale out the  losers. Again and again it has been demonstrated that the  bulk of people needing help are single parents and  unemployment beneficiaries, all well below the poverty line

as the accompanying table demonstrates.

It was just as well the agencies didn't get too excited. Nothing at all happened in the first eighteen months after  the announcement. In the 1979-80 Budget, however, money  was allocated.

The first surprise was that the $500,000 turned out to be  $420,000, because the Minister for Social Security had  re-classified the 1  slush fund', established to give once-only  grants to organisations in danger of folding, as part of the  emergency aid grants.

The second shock was that the Government had completely  ignored its own subsequent report with the Australian Council  of Social Service which was published in 1978, and showed that  some $12 to $14 million a year was being given a year in  cash and voucher grants by State Governments and non-government  organisations.  "

As we now know, its own National Consultative Council on^Social  Welfare had drawn the Government's urgent attention to the  demonstrated need in the community and ewds strongly of the  opinion that: Â·

(a ) income security is the responsibility of the Commonwealth Government .

(b ) a comprehensive income security system must include a  system for the provision of emergency relief as an  integral component."

Senator Guilfoyle ignorred that too.

But even that $420,000 has not been fully allocated* The  first grants were not made until March this year, 2-ÃÂ¾- years  after the election promise was made.

The Victorian Emergency Relief Committee recently held a  meeting of 35 agencies and reported their dissatisfaction to  Senator Guilfoyle, both on the inadequacy of the $125Â» 000  allocated to Victoria and the distribution of $104,000 of

that $125,000 to two large organisations,  the Salvation Army

4.

Ã¢ÂÂ  I

and St Vincent de Paul - against the advice of the Victorian  office of the Department with whom the Committee had worked. As the Committee stated:

"For many people who do not want to or are unable to  approach these agencies for help or who do not find  these agencies accessible to them in other ways  .assistance will not be available."

To add insult to injury, the Department is still referring  its own clients, social service recipients,  to agencies j   to which the Commonwealth gives no help. Some agencies which  have given assistance for up to 80 years are afraid they will  be forced to close down. "

This is not just happening in Victoria. The Launceston City  Mission is in the red for the first time in 123 years. In New South Wales even agencies which have funds to dispense  can keep going only by reducing the amounts of money to each  needy person or family.

The situation is desperate and will remain so while this  Government keeps single parents and the unemployed, in  particular,  in poverty.

The Government should restore the standard rate of pension  to the unemployed and allow them to earn as much as pensioners  without financial penalty. It should acknowledge the problems  of single parents on social services by raising the dependent

child allowance or giving, as the Labor Party suggests, a  family income supplement.

Until it does so it will be responsible for the economic and  social breakdown of struggling families, while giving only  token and selective report to a very few of the organisations  trying to pick up the pieces.

CARELESS TREATMENT OF SINGLE WOMEN .

Two groups of people, not significant in number but whose welfare  should be considered with more care and compassion than at present,   are suffering from restrictive policies of the Social Security  Department.  They are:

(a) Carers These are people, generally single women, who have  given up work to look after an aged and ailing parent. There  are over 1,000 of them and they receive special benefit. Because  special benefit is tied to the unemployment benefit they receive  only $'51.45 a week. That is, they are $300 or so worse off a  year because the Government refused to raise the single  unemployment benefit. It is shabby treatment of people who are

living up to the highest ideals of family care, and incidentally  saving the Government thousands of dollars a year.

(b) Young widows Widows under 45 lose their widows' pension  when their child or children are no longer dependent. They are  then eligible only for unemployment benefit or special benefit  until they turn 45. This virtually means an income drop of

$25 a week ($10 pension; $10 fringe benefits; and $5 if they get  rent allowance). Most of these women have no workforce skills  and the same household e x p e n s e s b u t no experience of the work test  Both are receiving the. same miserable treatment as the unemployed  because they are tied to a payment the Government will not raise.

STRESS IN THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SECURITY

The 1  Canberra Times' on 11 June this year ran a story  concerning Swami Shankarananda. The swami came to  Canberra to give a course,  arranged by an executive officer  of the head office of the Department of Social Security,   on managing executive stress. Company executives and  21 senior public servants registered for this seminar.

It is time equal attention was given to stress at the  counter and clerical levels in Social Security.

Staff shortages are causing problems in many States. This has resulted in poor service to claimants, particularly  in the benefits and allowances sections. The delays in  processing applications and changes of address cause  people to ring to ask why payment is late, and the need

to deal with phone calls means that less time can be spent  on putting the claims through. '

Staff are suffering from low job satisfaction because they  know that they are not adequately coping with the work;  because they are over-tired from working nights and .   Saturdays;  and because they are concerned about the welfare  of people whose cheques are held up.

It is under conditions of staff strain and delayed payments  that there can be desperate claimants who become aggressive  and violent.

The Department of Social Security has an allocation of $2.7  million for overtime, $400,000 more than they originally  budgeted for.  $2.1 million of this is being spent in the benefits processing area.

It appears that staff levels are being held down to levels  which jeopardise the health and welfare of staff and the  rights of clients. The only solution is to allocate more  staff to these heavily pressured areas.

There is also a need for the Government to release its  Inter-Departmental Committee report on counter services  so that we can know whether its recommendations are in  line with government practice.

COSTS IN THE ANTHONY WATERS CASE

Following the report in last month's Social Security Bulletin  on the prosecution of a young aboriginal,  Tony Waters,  who  was prosecuted for defrauding the Department of Social Security  nine months after he had repaid $135 casual earnings,  I have  received an answer from Senator Guilfoyle on the. cost.to the  Department of the prosecution. She replied that the costs  were not. available but "a direct cost of $5 Â· 50 was incurred in  connection with the prosecution of Mr Waters".

7 .

I consider this a flippant and unserious answer to a very  serious question. Does the Department do any estimate of  costing when it seeks to prosecute? Does it take into  account the amount of money involved in an offence? Does it .look seriously at the evidence it has to begin  prosecution?

I believe the Department could ascertain the legal costs  involved in the case and estimate the administrative hours  taken in preparing the file for prosecution, but refuses to

do so. The Minister has refused to make any comment at any  time on the case of Tony Waters,  and this flip answer is  another way of trying to close down any discussion.

PAYMENT TO SUPPORTING PARENTS IN FIRST SIX MONTHS

The first six months' payment to a lone parent previously  dependent on State benefits under the States Grants  (Deserted Wives) Act is no longer a system - it is a mess. . Â»  '

Until the end of last year the Commonwealth and States paid about half each of the $60 million involved. Victoria was  the first to break ranks. It announced it would no longer  pay their single parents with dependent children as it considered

such payments a Commonwealth responsibility. South Australia  follows suit from 1 July 1980. .

The single parents in Victoria and South Australia are now  being paid by the Commonwealth at special benefit rates and  by the States to top up the amount to supporting parents'  benefit level. The topping up is one amount for the over 18s,   a different amount for the under 18s.

The other States have not yet decided what to do, and when  last heard of had placed it on the agenda at the Premiers  Conference. Some States feel they have committed themselves  to paying a State grant plus other welfare services;  others

seem keen to save the money.

The only sensible course is either for the Commonwealth to  take over all the payments from day one of the application,  or as earlier suggested by State Welfare Ministers, completely  reimburse the States at supporting parents benefit level for

the first two months and then take over full responsibility.

Until the Commonwealth gives such a lead a great deal of  anxiety will remain for single parents and organisations  which care for their welfare.
