This dataset contains metadata and full text of items from the press releases collection that include the term 'refugees' (or a number of related terms).\n\nThe dataset was created in two stages. First, Trove was searched for relevant resources, and metadata from each search result was saved in a CSV file. Then links to ParlInfo contained within the metadata were used to download the full text.\n\nKnown issues:\n\n- some items had no downloadable text available in Parlinfo, so the number of text files is less than the number of metadata records\n- some items have different metadata but the same text, for example when a press release is issued by both a political party and an individual member\n- because of the way Trove groups records, it's possible some of the records don't include any of the search terms.",
