PRIME MINISTER

VISIT TO EAST TIMOR



I am pleased to announce that I will visit East Timor on 26 July 2007.  My visit will be an  important opportunity to engage with East Timorese leaders after the recent parliamentary  elections.

I intend to meet President Ramos-Horta, Interim Prime Minister da Silva and United  Nations Special Representative Dr Atul Khare to discuss the political, security and  development issues facing the country.



My Government is proud, through its leadership of the INTERFET coalition in 1999, to  have played a part in restoring stability in East Timor and supporting the efforts of the  East Timorese people to achieve independence. We remain committed to supporting the  East Timorese people as they go about the difficult and demanding task of building a  sustainable, democratic and prosperous future.

The Australian military and police contingent in East Timor made an important  contribution to the peaceful conduct of East Timorâ€™s recent presidential and parliamentary  elections, and continues to play a crucial role in providing security.  I look forward to  meeting these dedicated young Australians and, on behalf of all Australians,  acknowledging their contribution.
