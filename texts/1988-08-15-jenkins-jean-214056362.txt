TUCKEY "NO CREDIT TO WA" —  DEMOCRAT

The Australian Democrats' immigration spokesperson, Senator Jean Jenkins,  has rebuked the Liberal Member for Forrest, Mr Wilson Tuckey over his  reported statement that Asian immigration should be stopped.

Senator Jenkins said that Mr Tuckey's views were out of step with the  philosophy of democratic pluralism to which his party subscribed and which  was the only sensible basis for a mature democracy such as Australia.  V.,

'  "ironically, if Mr Tuckey had his way, it would mean an end to the current  business and skills migration programmes as well as the humanitarian  family reunion and refugee schemes," Senator Jenkins said.

"Mr Tuckey and the Coalition opposition leaders do not need to look very  far for an example of the destiny of a nation which uses racial origin and  skin colour as a basis for the regulation oÂ£ population.

"South Africa is deservedly ostracised for having taken this line, and  Wilson Tuckey is demeaning Australia by suggesting that we should follow  South Africa down that unpleasant track.

"It is time Liberal Party constituents realised that they deserve better  representatives than Wilson Tuckey, and his loud presence in the Federal  Parliament does no credit to Western Australia," Senator Jenkins said.
