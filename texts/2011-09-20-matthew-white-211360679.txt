20 September 2011

TRANSCRIPT OF THE HON. TONY ABBOTT MHR,  INTERVIEW WITH MATTHEW WHITE,  SUNRISE, CHANNEL SEVEN

Subjects: Border protection.

E&OE……………………….…………………………………………………………………

MATTHEW WHITE:

Opposition Leader Tony Abbott joins me now from Melbourne this morning. Good morning, Mr Abbott.

TONY ABBOTT:

`Morning, Matt.

MATTHEW WHITE:

Yesterday’s meeting with the Prime Minister went nowhere, you met with your own party last night. So  what did you tell them?

TONY ABBOTT:

I told them that the Coalition has been very consistent for the last decade, Matt. We have supported Nauru,  temporary protection visas and turning boats around where it’s safe to do so. By contrast, the Prime Minister  has flipped and flopped and chopped and changed. She couldn’t even keep a position from Friday night to  Monday morning. Now, if the Government wants offshore processing it can have offshore processing, it  should have offshore processing and it should be at Nauru and it could have had Nauru offshore processing  at any time over the last 12 months.

MATTHEW WHITE:

Mr Abbott, why should the Government accept your amendments if you’re not going to accept theirs?  Where’s this stalemate going to end?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, the Prime Minister has a responsibility to get her policy through the parliament. The Prime Minister  can’t turn around and say to the Opposition Leader ‘oh look it’s your responsibility to get my policy through  the parliament.’ My responsibility, Matt, is to good policy, to consistent policy and we’ve had good policy,  consistent policy for a decade now and our policy has stopped the boats. Her policy started the boats up

again, her policy has given us 240 boats and 12,000 illegal arrivals. So, let’s have policy that’s worked not  policy that’s proven to fail.

MATTHEW WHITE:

But you talk about turning the boats back around and they could well and truly be towed back to Indonesia  which is not a signatory of this convention either. So, where are you left there?

TONY ABBOTT:

The fact is that our obligations aren’t triggered, our obligations under the refugee convention aren’t triggered  until people have come to Australia. But I again make the point, Matt, than turning boats around along with  Nauru and temporary protection visas was the policy that worked under the Howard Government. I mean,  this Government says that they support offshore processing. They actually closed offshore processing down  and they have not processed a single person offshore in the 12 months since the Prime Minister first started  talking about her East Timor so-called solution.

MATTHEW WHITE:

But isn’t this meant to be now at this stage about compromise? You’re saying it’s your policy, your terms.  There’s no compromise in there.

TONY ABBOTT:

There’s no compromise from the Prime Minister. I put forward to her a very reasonable counter position  yesterday having sought very good legal advice from the former Solicitor-General, David Bennett QC, on  her position and David Bennett’s advice was that our proposal was much less likely to be legally challenged  and retained the important protections that the Howard Government thought was necessary. You see, we  have the patent in the Coalition, we have the patent on offshore processing, we also have the patent on  offshore protections and I can’t understand why the Labor Party - which, for years attacked the Howard  Government as brutal and heartless on this issue - is now proposing something which provides no  protections to boat people whatsoever.

MATTHEW WHITE:

Surely you know, though, Mr Abbott that the electorate is getting sick of this. They want a solution and  you’re saying effectively there is no solution, the Prime Minister’s saying there’s no solution. What can you  tell the Australian people?

TONY ABBOTT:

Wrong, Matt. Wrong, wrong, wrong, Matt. Our solution, the solution that’s been proven to work, the  solution that we have been consistently advocating is Nauru, temporary protection visas and turning boats  around where it’s safe to do so. Now, if the Prime Minister wants to go ahead with Nauru - that’s offshore  processing. If she wants to go ahead with Manus, which until a week or so back was actually part of her  policy - that’s offshore processing, too. We believe in offshore processing but it can’t be offshore dumping  and that’s what the Prime Minister is proposing with Malaysia.

MATTHEW WHITE:

Well, until there’s a compromise there’s going to be no solution, there’s no compromise. Now, today’s  Newspoll has the ALP’s primary at just 26 per cent, Mr Abbott. That’s down one point. But you’ve shed five  points in the satisfaction rating, the Prime Minister has gone up. So do you think that her efforts to seek  compromise, the dreaded word, is being rewarded?

TONY ABBOTT:

Matt, I’m not going to run a commentary on the polls but just on this question of compromise it’s important  to have policy that works and the Malaysia deal, the Malaysia people-swap, is a proven failure. Since it was  announced we’ve had 1,000 boat people. Since it was signed we’ve had 400 boat people. By contrast, we  know that the Coalition’s consistent decade-long policy of Nauru, temporary protection visas and turning  boats around, that does work. We had fewer than three boats a year under the Coalition’s policy. Since Julia  Gillard dismantled the Coalition’s policy we’ve had almost two boats a week. So, let’s have the right policy.  Let’s not have a weak compromise with a bad government.

MATTHEW WHITE:

Alright, the stalemate continues. Tony Abbott, thanks for your time this morning.

TONY ABBOTT:

It’s no stalemate. They could have offshore processing tomorrow at Nauru and that works.
