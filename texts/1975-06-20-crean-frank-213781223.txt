VISIT BY THE MINISTER FOR OVERSEAS TRADE, MR. FRANK  OREAN, TO IL SIN HOSPITAL, PUSAN, REPUBLIC OF KOREA,  ____________________ 19 JUNE, 1975. ________________

(Statement released by Press Secretary travelling with the Minister)

Seoiil. Friday - Australia's Minister for Overseas Trade, Mr. Frank Crean, late yesterday visited the II Sin Women's  Hospital, at Pusan, 400 miles south of here. With Mrs. Crean,  he spent an hour touring the wards and talking to hospital

staff.

The visit to the Republic of Korea's biggest  obstetrics hospital had a special significance for the  Minister, a former elder of the Presbyterian church.

Mr. Crean is a trustee of the Mackenzie  Foundation which is conducting an appeal in Australia for  a quarter of a million dollars for the hospital. The appeal  opens on June 25.

Sisters, Dr. Helen and Miss Cath Mackenzie,  daughters of Presbyterian missionaries who came to Korea  early this century, founded the hospital in 1952, originally  to care for refugee mothers and their babies.

Today, the 155-bed hospital in downtown  Pusan - a city approaching the size of Sydney - delivers  more than 5,000 babies a year. It operates the biggest  midwifery school in the country. In addition, II Sin

handles about 400 outpatients a day.

Dr. Y.S. Kim is the Superintendent and the

staff includes several Australians.

Money from the Australian appeal will go to

establish a fund to help mothers who cannot afford the cost  of their confinement. Three of the 15 babies delivered each  day at II Sin are born to women in this category.
