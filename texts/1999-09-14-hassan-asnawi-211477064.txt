The Impacts of Socio - Economic   Crisis on Indonesian People

Presenter:   Asnawi Hassan

Secretary General, llndonesian National Council of   Sociall Service

I. INTRODUCTION

1. On May 30, 1997, the World Bank published a report entitled “Indonesia- Sustaining

High Growth with Equity”. This report indicated that the Indonesian economy in recent years

was performing very well, with GDP (Gross Domestic Product) growing at the average

annual rate of 7.7. per cent during the period 19991-1994, at 8.2 per cent in 1995, and at 7.8 per

cent in 1996.However, only two months after the publication of that report, the whole picture

had changed as the Indonesia rupiah, in the wake of the depreciation of the Thai baht, started

depreciating steeply. It created monetary crisis.

2. The trigger of the monetary, economic, political, and social crises in Indonesia was the

depreciation of rupiah against US dollar. The exchange rate crisis - more popularly called

monetary crisis - happened in the middle of July 1977. The exchange rate of rupiah against

US dollar inThe beginning of July 1997 was Rp. 2,432 per US dollar and at the end of

August 1997 reached Rp. 3,035 per US dollar. To anticipate further and more deteriorating

depreciation, on November 1, 1997, the government made a policy to liquidate 16 banks

with fatal consequences in the form of mistrust of people to the banking institutions so that

every where happened a rush to the banks.This government policy further accelerated the

crisis. The rupiah exchange rate deteriorated until the level of Rp. 16,000 per US dollar on

January 22,1998. This means that the depreciation of rupiah was about 555 per cent.

3. The continuing depreciation of rupiah caused many factories using imported raw

materials and spare parts in their production process were in stagnated condition so that the

production capacity could not be utilized optimally, which threatened the continuance of the

factories or companies at that time. Then started the rationalization or reduction of the labor

force in the real sector. When rationalization was also not possible to maintain the

continuous operation of the companies many factories were closed and their machinery and

equipment became scrap iron. Many workers were laid off which caused social uncertainty

and social unrest. Protest demonstrations happened everywhere. The students demanded

political change and reformation, however, they still demanded change in the campus and

had not yet made action outside the campus. On May 12, 1998, bloody riots happened in

Trisakti University campus in Jakarta. The security apparatus shot Trisakti studensts who

were making protest demonstration and four students were killed. In the following two days

riots happened everywhere in the form of looting, arson, and burning of shops in the

economic centres in Jakarta.

There were also social upheavals in other cities such as in Surakarta (Central Java),

Yogyakarta (Yogyakarta Special Province), Surabaya East Java), and Medan (North

Sumatra). As consequence of the riots many foreign descendants took refuge abroad

transfering their money (capital flight).

4. The situation after the riots became uncertain. Security apparatus were alert on many

strategic places in Jakarta. Students started demonstrating outside their campus and they

went into the streets. Then they entered and occupied the Parliament Building. They

demanded reformation and the eradication of corruption, collusion, an nepotism. As that

time, reformation was understood more as the replacement of national leadership. For many

days the students occupied the Parliament Building and put pressure on the People’s

Consultative-Assembly to undertake a special session to with-draw the mandate that had

been given to the President. On May 18, 1998 the leadership of the Peoples Consultative

Assembly - Parliament suggested the President to resign. After debates were conducted

concerning the above mentioned suggestion, on May 21, 1998, Soeharto resigned as

president and was replaced by B.J. Habibie. The next day, May 22, 1998 President Habibie

announced the Reformation Development Cabinet.

5. The appointment of B.J. Habibie as the Fourth President of the Republic of Indonesia

became controversial. A part of the people questioned the legality of the appointment,

however, there were also people who considered the appointment constitutional. Although

there were differences concerning the matter there was an agreement that the president and

the present government is only a transitional in character and had the task to undertake

general election in June 1999. For that matter the People’s Consultative Assembly

undertook a special session in November 1998 to decide a decree concerning the

implementation of a just and honest general election and to decide other decrees concerned

with the crisis and peoples demand, to eradicate corruption, collusion, and nepotism, and to

discuss the problem of armed forces double function, economic democracy, etc.

6. In general, the economic condition during 1998 was worse as compared to the previous

year. During 1998 there was an outflow of private capital amounted to USD 15,4 billion.

Domestic consumption declined due to the sharp drop of the people’s purchasing power.

From the GDP component point of view, the growth rate of the private consumption went

down fall from 6,6 % in the year 1997 to -5,0 % in the year 1998.

The economic growth rate was -15   O/O and inflation was 78 %. Meanwhile the interest rate

rocketed until 60 %.

In the year 1998 Indonesia had not been able to come out of the crisis, even the crisis had not

reached the bottom as the further climb again and reach economic restoration.

The crisis had made Indonesia to plunge back again into a poor country. Per capita income

before the crisis about USD 1000 decreased sharply into about USD 400 at the end of the year

1998. The poverty level which first was improving, during the crisis jumped into 80 million

people.

Besides, thexconomic crisis has caused the addition of unemployment to at least 20 million

people.

7. After the economic crisis lasted for about several months, the real source of economic

crisis was identified. The source of the crisis had been observed by the students which are

corruption, collusion, and nepotism. The three words can be summarized into one word

which is moral degeneration. Moral generation of the government officials and businessmen

has become the source of all economic, political, social, and cultural crisis in Indonesia.

8. The effort of the government to slow down the decreasing rate of the economic capacity

was done by formulating various deregulation policies agreed by IMF. On April 8, 1998, the

government had signed an agreement with IMF as a requirement to provide financial aid to

Indonesia.

9, The government, at the beginning of the year 1998, had identified the problem which

was the depreciation of rupiah exchange rate that still continued accompanied by natural

disasters such as a long drought which caused the increase of commodity prices. The

inflation in January 1998 was 6,9 % and in February 1998 was 12,7 %, while in March 1998

decreased to become 5,5 O/o. The consequence of the drought had caused food prices to

increase sharply.

The domestic financial position deteriorates in line with the worsening economic crisis. In

responding this situation, Bank of Indonesia provided huge liquidity aid reaching about Rp.

140 trillion. This decision put more pressure on the rupiah exchange rate and the foreign

exchange reserves. Simultaneously, foreign banks had stopped trade credit channels and

other credits to the banks in Indonesia so that the industrial companies experienced

difficulty to obtain raw materials and spare parts for their production process.

10. Meanwhile, the government had formulated policies to be implemented which

are :

(1). To stabilize the rupiah rate of exchange to a higher level which reflects the Indonesian

economy, among others through a stricter monetary policy ;

(2). To strengthen and put more control on the restructurization strategy of the banking

system ;

(3). To strengthen the implementation of structural reformation which will create a base for -   more efficient and competetive economy ;

(4). To prepare a framework to solve the private debt problem comprehensively ;

(5). To restore trade financing to a normal condition and to restore domestic production,

especially the export sector.

11. The financial, especially, the banking sector was the worst hit by the economic crisis.

On April 4, 1998 IBRA (Indonesia Banking Restructuring Agency) had frozen the property

and management of seven banks which had borrowed more than Rp. 2 trillion from Bank of

Indonesia, covering 75

O/O of all the loan provided by Bank of Indonesia to the national

banking system. Simultaneously, IBRA had frozen the operational activities of seven banks

which had borrowed from Bank of Indonesia more than 500 % of their capital and 75 O/o of

their total assets. Previously, at the end of the year 1997, the government had also liquidated

16 banks and on March 16,1999, IBRA had liquidated 38 more banks.

12. Industrial sector was also severely hit by the storm of economic crisis. Foreign mistrust

of the national banking system spread to the real sector in the form of the rejection of L/C

submitted by the industrial companies. As a consequence, the import of commodities,

especially raw materials, became stagnated. Since the end of the year 1997 until June 1998,

822 industrial manufacturers of large and intermediate size became bankrupt, while 690 other

industries diminished their size of business forcing them to decrease the amount of labor.

Bankrupt industries among others are :

(1). textile industries (260 units) ;

(2). food industries (150 units) ;

(3). wood industries (131 units) ;

(4). chemical industries (86 units) ;

(5). metal industries (79 units) ;

(6). non - metal industries (62 units) ;

(7). paper industries (31 units) ;

(8). basic metal industries (2 units).

The number of those bankrupt industries reached 3.48 % of the numbers of intermediate and

large scale industries in Indonesia which according to National Economic Survey of 1996

reached 23,632 units.

The data collected through National Economic Survey conducted in February 1997 and 1998

indicated that there were 1.6 million people of the labor force were discharged and changed

their profession. The industrial sector experienced a decrease of a huge number of workers

which is about 13.0 % (from 9.4 million to 8.2 million people).

13. The educational sector also experiences the impact of economic crisis. In the school

year 1997/1998, 1,655 students in the district of Central Jakarta (Jakarta Province has five

districts) consisting of 470 elementary school students and 595 senior high school students

could not continue their education because their parents could not afford to pay their

educational expenses. Meanwhile, since the occurrence of economic crisis, there are 380,000

private university students (30 % the whole registered private university students) could not

continue their education.

14. The monetary crisis happened at the same time with food crisis and severe forest fires

in several provinces that resulted in the forest destruction of more than 263,900 Ha. The food

crisis was started by a long drought due to El Nino. The impact of the crisis is the emergency

of the problem of food security. In 13 out of 27 provinces in Indonesia are caught in food

security problem. From this number, 5 provinces are categorized to have very low food

security and need high priority to be immediately solved.

15. Other emerging problems faced by Indonesia in the crisis period, besides the increase

of unemployment due to the liquidation of banks and the bankruptcy of companies in the real

sector, are the disappearing trust to the government and the emerging of pent-up political

problems in the form of social unrests and conflicts, horizontally as well as vertically.

16. Over a period of the year 1998 various forms of social unrest occurred, among others

the killing of sorcerers in Banyuwangi (East Java) where more than 100 people were killed,

conflict between students and security apparatus in Ambon (Maluku) injuring more than 30

people, student demonstrations in Jakarta killing 14 people, riots caused by conflict and racial

prejudice in Ketapang (West Kalimantan), killing six people. The riots are still continuing in

several places until now.

17. Meanwhile, according to the Chief of Police, the level of crime during the economic

crisis has increased at about 10 %. In his opinion the increase of crime is sufficiently high. The

quality of criminal deeds also increased from conventional crime into modern one leading to

brutal and desperate acts.

II. THE IMPACT OF SOCIO- ECONOMIC CRISIS

ON THE INDONESIAN PEOPLE

2.1. Multidimensionality of the Crisis

18. The crisis started concomitantly with severe drought in mid 1997. Severe drought

alone had caused millions of small and traditional farmers fail to grow and harvest rice and

other food crops, lost their jobs and source of income, and in some regions some of them

even experienced food shortage, hunger and famine. Indonesia has been hit by a series of

serious crises started with monetary crisis in mid 1997, followed by economic, political, and

social crises.

19. The multidimensional crisis covering among others .

(1). Monetary crisis when rupiah exchange rate drastically declined from below Rp. 3.000

(Juliy 2997) to above Rp. 14.000 per US dollar (July 1998) ;

(2). Economic crisis as indicated , among others, by :

a.bankruptcy of many national banks and medium and large scale industrial,

manufacturing, and business enterpreses ;

b.increase of inflation from 11.1% in 1997 to 77.1% in 1998 ;

c. decline of nominal GDP (from USD 216.0 billion in 1997 to USD 97.6 billion in 1998),

nominal GDP per capita (from USD 1,079 in 1997 to USD 474 in 1998), and growth

of real GDP (from 4.60% in 1997 to - 15% in 1998) ;

d. stagnation of economic activities ;

(3). Food crisis when the farmers failed to grow and harvest rice and other staple food

crop, shortage of staple food stock, skyrocketing food prices, and the incidence of mass

hunger and famine in several places in Indonesia ;

(4). Labour crisis in 1997 when worker group demonstrations for better wage appeared

and thousands of migrant workers were expelled from the countries where they work ;

(5). Mass destructions outbroke in 1997 in Situbondo (East Java), Tasikmalaya and Rengas

DengkIok (West Java), Sanggau Ledo (West Kalimantan), Banjarmasin (South Kalimantan),

and Jakarta.

2.2. The Impact of Crisis on Politics

20. Political disturbances in the aftermath of the financial crisis and massive student

demonstrations demanding for a total reform, resulted in the downfall of the New Order

Government which had ruled for 32 years. The new administration initiated a number of

reforms, among others liberalizing trade and domestic economy ; restructuring financial

sector; launching reorganization and decentralization of the central government machinery;

liberalizing the formation of new political parties; holding free and fair election; and

introducing anti corruption measures. People’s demands for political transparency, fairness

and justice as well as greater government accountability and responsiveness continue

louded, and the country seems to be going through a period of deep and wide ranging

political transition and uncertainty. The government has committed itself to the reform

agenda, but the degree to which it can manage the process of transition remains unclear.

-.

2.3. The Impact of Crisis on Economy

21. Following steady growth of about 7 to 8 per cent in the last two decades up to mid

1997 Indonesia has since been mired in the worst recession. Due to capital flight, rupiah

exchange rate has fallen so steeply that the prices of basic necessities skyrocketted while

people’s income and purchasing power declines severely. Annual inflation rate rose up

uncontrolably to about 80 per cent, and income per capita declined from as high as US $

1,200 in 1997 to US $ 300 in 1998. The national banking system collased medium and large

industrial, manufacturing and business enterprices fell into bankrupcy.

2.4. The Impact of Crisis on Poverty

22. The number of poor people increased drastically to about 49.5 million (31.9 millon

people live in rural areas and 17.6 million live in urban areas) or 39.1% in 1998 from about

22.5 million people or 11.3% in 1996. From February 1996 to December 1998, the number of

poor people had increased 144% in urban areas and 108”/0 in rural areas. So in term of

poverty, urban population suffer more than their counterpart in rural areas.

23. Both urban and rural labour force suffered from being displaced from works because

of crisis. Urban unemployment increased slightly from 8.06% in 1997 to 9.27% in 1998, and

rural unemployment from 2.84% in 1997 to 3.32% in 1998. This means that the direct impact

of crisis in urban areas poses indirect impact on rural employment, because a number of

displaced workers returned to their rural villages. Out of the 4.2 million laid off workers,

77.42% or about 3.2 million were employees, whereas the remaining one million were

informal sector workers. Information on persons having previous work experience looking

for job increased by 22.3% and 23.72% for male and female in urban areas, and by 20.36%

and 12.92% in rural areas.

2.5. The Impact of Crisis on Employment

24. In the year 1997 the number of labour iorce had reached 90 million people. Within one

year periodfiat number had increased to become 93 million people. The increase of three

million people brought a consequence on the supply and creation of employment

opportunities. This is a very difficult problem, especially during economic crisis.

25. The crisis generated severe unemployment. Unemployment rate had increased almost

four fold from 4.68% in the year 1997 to 16.24% in the year 1997, where rural unemployment

increased from 2.84% (in1997) to 16.90% (in 1998) and urban unemployment increased from

8.06% (in 1997) to 15.01% (in 1998). Unemployment of male people who had work before

increased from 21.02% (in 1997) to 42.64% (in 1998), whereas the unemployment of female

people increased from 14.86% (in 1997) to 32.64% (in 1998).

26. Economic crisis has made many companies to adopt a policy of restructuring their

labour or has even made the companies bankrupt. Discharging workers in many companies

cannot be avoided and it generates a lot of unemployed people. Most of the them are men

who have families. The number of discharged workers increased from 0,7 million or 0.1% (in

1997) to 22.4 million or 6.1% (in 1998), whereas the number of inactive workers increased

from 2.0 million (in 1997) to 15.9 million (in 1998).

27. The crisis had worsened the situation of Indonesian migrant workers employed,

legally or illegally, and often exploited in countries in the region like Malaysia and South

Korea which have also been afflicted by the crisis. An estimated 1.4 million Indonesians

worked in Malaysia as migrant workers. Many lost their jobs and were subjected to harsh

treatment, detention and deportation back to Indonesia where they joined the ranks of the

unemployed and added to the burden on their families. Several states in the region have

now instituted draconian policies to restrict migrant labour.

28. The severe impact of the crisis on the people is the decrease of income.

The decrease of income of the income group of less than Rp. 200,000 in the informal sector is

- 22.08% and in the formal sector is - 11.87% ; of the income group of Rp. 200,000 - Rp.

400,000 in the informal sector is - 15.17% and in the formal sector is - 1.32% ; of the income

group of Rp. 400,000 - Rp. l,OOO,OOO is - 3.78% ; while of the income group of more than Rp.

l,OOO,OOO is 4.01%.

2.6. The Impact of Crisis on Food Security and Nutrition

29. Because of severe drought happened in 1997, many small and traditional farmers could

not grow and harvest rice and other staple crops. The people in some regions (Irian Jaya,

Central Java, and East Java) suffered from food shortage and the incidence of mass hunger

and famine happened.

30. Severe drought and economic crisis caused many starving families. Many people were

discharged from their jobs and they do not have any purchasing power which become worse

by a sharp inflation. While income and purchasing power of low income groups declined

drastically, the prices of basic needs particularly food, sky rocketed. Scarcity of food has

affected 17.5 million families. If each familiy has about five members, so that scarcity of food

affected 90 million people.

31. Many families face the food crisis by consuming less food, while others are forced to

repalce their food with inferior quality food or reduced the frequency of their meals from

three times to only twice or once a day.

Problems caused by economic crisis created conditions threatening the decrease of the status

of nutrition of the people, especially the children. A lot people cannot afford to buy healthly

and nutritional food (which of course expensive) such as beef, chicken, fish, and egg. So,

they (including under five year children and pregnant women) have to suffer from

inadequate calorie and nutrition intake. The implication is that the number of malnourished

children under five year is alarming ; it increases five times during the crisis. Besides, the

implication can also be seen by the increase of under weight births. In the year 1997 the

incidence rate of underweight births was 5.8% and in the year 1998 increased to 7.5%. The

increase is more significant for households of the below 40% income.

2.7. The Impact of Crisis on Health

32. Health situation of the population at certain times can be utilized to provide

illustration z-ncerning the status of the general health of the people. In the year 1998, the

population health status is reflected by the morbidity rate reaching 25.4%. This means that

more than one quarter of all the population of Indonesia ever suffered health problems

disturbing them of carrying out their daily work. Compared to the year 1997 there was an

increase in morbidity rate from 24.4% in 1997 to 25.4% in 1998. This could be caused by a

long drought and a deteriorating economic crisis.

33. The percentage of people with health problems increased significantly from 3.21”/0 in

the year 1997 to 3.56% in the year 1998 for those who are currently still facing the problem of

health ; and from 9.55”/0 in the year 1997 to 10.97% in the year 1998 for those without health

probiem anymore. Skyrocketted prices of drugs, vaccines, contraceptives, health service and

hospitalization, have deterred low income people to take them. They incline to seek cheaper

drug, such as generic medicine, consulting paramedics, or leaving their ilnesses untreated.

They did not turn to health centres or traditional healers, as indicated by declined visiting

rates of 1% in urban areas and 1.2% in rural areas. The percentage of those consulting

paramedics have markedly increased from 10% to 14”/0 in urban areas and from 24Yo to 29’/0

in rural areas. Expensive contraceptives has caused about two million family planning

acceptors withdrew. The crisis has also affected the quallity of health services for pregnant

women especially those from low income families.

34.

In Indonesia delivering babies are carried out by physicians or midwives. Compared to

the year 1997, deliveries of babies by physicians and midwives in urban areas decreased. In

1997 it reached 81% yet in 1998 it decreased to 74%. A significant decrease happened to

deliveries by midwives, that was from 64.3% in the year 1997 to 56.7% in the year 1998. This

is probably due to economic crisis, since the low and middle level people cannot anymore

afford to pay the tariff of midwives. To replace the midwives they asked their families or

traditional midwives to help them deliver the babies which in the year 1998 had reached to

7% from 0.5% in the year 1997.

2.8. The Impact of Crisis on Education

35. The crisis is not only affecting current income but threatening future income earning

capacity by hurting the health and education of Indonesians, especially the Indonesia poor.

In times of crisis, the education of children tends to suffer first. Households pull their

children out of school to try to cope with the crisis both to save on school fees, cost of books

and stationery, and associated expenses and to help earn additional income.

Ministry of Education and Culture estimated that about 3.5 million pupils of elementary

schools failed to continue onto secondary education because of the crisis. About eight million

elementary and secondary school students may have dropped out. About six million school

age children have failed to register at school, because their parents cannot afford to pay

registration fee. Thousands of public and private university students had postponed or

discontinued their studies, because their parents cannot afford anymore to pay their tuition

fees.

2.9. The Impact of Crisis on Environment

36. As a consequence of crisis, Indonesia’s environment will experience increased threat

from rising poverty, the drought and accompanying fires, and population growth and

movement. The crisis more or less will have serious impact to the overexploitation of

environment. During the crisis, more people were turning to the country’s last remaining

natural resources to obtain another living. This will increase illegal wood cutting and will

eventually destroy the forest. The crisis may also threaten the overexploitation of marine -

fish. The effect of many local people turn to their village to obtain a meager living may

endanger fish habitat by using unsave way of taking fish such as bombing.

37. Besides crisis has driven industrial activity reduce or cut their budget of providing

waste treatment plant. Hundreds fish pond farmers were complaining that they lost

hundreds billion rupiah because their ponds had been polluted by waste of sugar factories.

The factories cannot afford to provide waste treatment because of the increasing cost of the

plants.

2.10. The Impact of Crisis on Women

38. In Indonesia, there are more women (51%) than men (49%). It is caused by higher

natural mortility rate of men than of women. Tradition places married women as

housewives who are responsible to take care of the households, while men are the

breadwinners. Married women can never become household heads, unless their husbands

died. Work for women mostly is only for supplementing household income and not for

career.

39. Since the main role of women is taking care of houshold, therefore high education is

not essential for them. Some education is enough for women to enable them in managing the

households effectively. As a consequence the level of education of women in general is lower

than the level of education of men. The number of women finished primary school or less in

1998 is larger (almost 70%) as compared to men (56%). While the percentages of women with

secondary and tertiary education are much smaller than men.

40. The crisis is particularly bad news for women, for whom it is a cause of deep anxiety

and long - term stress in all areas of their lives. Women feel its influence every where : as

workers, as consumers, as wives, and as mothers. Women suffer dispropotionately in an

economic crisis. Women bear the primary responsibility for the household budget. As food

and other prices rose,. women were among the first to protest in the streets of Jakarta.

Women bear the brunt of food and medical shortages by eating last and less or foregoing

treatment, exposing themselves to anaemia at the same time as they take on extra

responsibilities.

41. Unemployment rate of the female labour force is higher than that of male, eventhough

the crisis affects male workers more than female workers. Male unemployment rate

increased 22% (from 4.09% to 5.01%), while that of female, increase less than 9% ( from 5.64%

to 6.12%).

Labour force participation rate of female (44% in 1997) is much lower than that of male (72%

in 1997). The crisis has driven the position of women weaker. More women are forced to

enter labour force, so that their labour force participation rate increased to 51% in 1998,

eventhough most of them cannot find jobs. The percentage of women working less than 35

hours per week increased to 51.3%. More women working in unproductive employment has

reflected that most of them engaged in informal sectors. In 1997, there were about 70% of

female (compared to 58% of male) worked in informal sectors, and about 36% of them

worked as unpaid family workers in household works and income earning activities. Larger

percentage of women worked in traditional sectors as blue collar workers, that is in

agriculture, (40%), trade (27%), manufacturing (15%), and services (14%). The crisis has also

forced women out of manufacturing (13%) and trade (25%) sectors. There has been a marked

male - female income difference, which is much higher in rural areas than that in urban

areas. The crisis has caused female workers’ real income declined sharper (29%) than that of

men (22%).

42. The crisis has also worsened the health condition of women more than that of men

especially pregnant women in remote and isolated areas. The percentage of women having

health problem increased 1.9% (from 12.6% to 14.5%) than that of men which was only 1.6%

(from 13% to 14.6%). It indicates that women have to pay higher risk and costs of the crisis,

than men do. Pregnant women are especially vulnerable. There is tendency that pregnant

women may choose to deliver at home, raising risk to both mother and baby and likely

raising the maternal and infant mortality rates which are already amongst the highest in the

region. During the crisis, it is estimated that the maternal risk will increase. Relating to

family planning, about two million familly planning acceptors had withdrawn from this

program because they cannot afford to pay the contraceptive devices anymore due to high

price. As a consequence, the birth rate is expected to rise.

2.11. The Impact of Crisis on Children

43. The crisis has created the conditions for a worrying escalation in child labour. One of

the impact of economic crisis is that the children have to work to cover the burden for

fulfilling the needs of their families. About 2.5 million children are at present forced to work.

The number of child labour increases significantly compared with the number in 1995, that is

1.7 million.

In one year period of the crisis, children and school age employment have increased. Child

employment increased from 7.4% to 7.9%. It increased higher in rural areas, and male child

employment is higher than female child employment. School age employment also indicates

a slight increase from 22% to 23%, where male school age employment increased more than

that of female.

44. Education participation rate among children aged 7 - 12 years (primary education) are

not really affected by the crisis. There was even a significant increase in rate of participation

of this age group from 89.1% in 1997 to 92.7% in 1998. But the participation of the age group

of 13 - 15 years (junior secondary education) decreased markedly from 69.0% in 1997 to

65.2% in 1998, where the participation rate of female was decreased more than that of male.

For senior secondary education there was a drop from 12.3% to. 10.0%. In urban areas,

female senior secondary education participation dropped from 20.5% in 1997 to 17.7% in

1998. In terms of income group of their parents, children aged 7 - 12 years from the bottom

quartile income group, there was drop of 4.9% enrollment .The percentage of children

reported that they were in poor health increased from 7.0% in 1997 to 8.3% in 1998, and those

had been sick increased from 21.0% to 22.0”/0.

45. The impact of economic crisis on social welfare in Indonesia can be seen from the

increase of the number of abandoned children. Based on the data collected through Nationai

Socio - economic Survey conducted in 1998, it was reported that 3.9 million children were

abandoned, consisting of 1.1 million children below the age of five and 2.8 million children

of the age 6 - 18 years. Abandoned children become a problem at present as well as in the

future. Problems of education and mental development of the abandoned children need

immediately to be solved to prepare for their future. Certainly the solution of these problems

need a lot of serious attention and huge funds.

46. Meanwhile, the Department of Social Affairs estimated that the number of street

children has increased to 400% compared with the number before crisis. The data of the

number of street children in Indonesia is not accurate. However, it is estimated that the total

number is above 50,000 children. Street children look for food in various places, among

others in the intersections of street, supermarkets, and traditional markets. They are of both

gender, girls as well as boys. The result of the survey reveals that roaming street girls are

due to household conditions which make them suffer, especially because of physical torture.

The parents play a role to make them run away frome home and look for freedom outside

the house. Beside the experience of physical torture, they want to help their parents to earn

money and they also want to have money for themselves. Some of them were indeed forced

by their pars:ts to look for money on the streets.. Street life is very hard and full of

exploitation. The strategy the street children use in trying to survive is to develop a

solidarity spirit among them. Their activities are begging, playing music, shining shoes,

colllecting useful things from garbage, offering small articles for sale, pickpocket, and even

selling drugs. In several cases, sexual activity is used by street girls as a strategy for survival,

but they become easy prey to sexual exploitation.

2.12. The Impact of Crisis on the Elderly

47. The Indonesian population age structure is considered young, although it has the

tendency to decline. The proportion of children aged 0 - 14 years decrease from 44,0% in the

year 1971 to 30,5% in the year 1998. In the same period people of working age (15 - 64 years)

increased from 53,5% to 64,9’10 and those aged 65 years and above increased from 2,5’/0 to

4.6”L). This shows that Indonesia has approached the category of old people. Even in

Yogyakarta Province, the proportion of the population with an age of 65 years and older has

reached 9,5%.

There were13.9 million people aged 60 years and older in 1997. Their number increased to

14.3 million in 1998. More elderly live in rural areas (66’/0). Since women have higher life

expectancy, there are more female elderly (51.0’/0) than male elderly (49.0%). Being the

product of older generation, their level of education is much lower than the general

population. The level of education of most of the elderly (94.0%) is primary school or less,

compared to 61% of the general population.

48. About 50.3% of the elderly were in labour force in 1997, and increased to 51.8% in 1998

as the crisis pushed more of them to work. Their employment indicated that the majority of

elderly work in the informal sector. In 1997 nearly 89% of elderly living in rural areas and

about 76% of those living in urban areas engaged in informal activities. In rural areas, less

than 10% of the elderly work as labourers or employees, while in urban areas the number is

around 20%. The percentage of them who are still active as employers is larger (3.3% in

urban areas and 1.6% in rural areas) than the general population (2.3% in urban areas and

1.4% in rural areas).

49. The crisis has forced a lot of elderly who are still active as employees in formal sectors

out. The percentage of decrease is 20.4% in urban and 8.9% in rural areas. The percentage of   --

the elderly who engage in informal sector increased to 76.4% in urban and 90% in rural

areas. This shift of formal to informal sector has resulted in the increase of

underemployment among elderly. Those working less than 35 hours per week increased

from 37.1% to 39.4% during 1997 - 1998 period in urban areas, while the increase in rural

areas was from 55.1% to 58.6%. In short, the crisis has forced a lot of the elderly (particularly

those from low income group) to engage in informal employment as part of the families

coping mechanism with the impacts of crisis.

2.13. The Impact of Crisis on the Widespread

and Escalation of Social Problems

50. The crisis which is multidimensional in character has strong influence in

widespreading and escalating social problems. They are very serious for the future of

Indonesian nation. Some of them are listed as under.

(1). Increased number of people belong to absolute poverty and or become abjectly poor,

particularly low income families, poor families living in slum areas, informal sector

workers, manual labourers, poor farmers and fishermen

(2). Increased influx of rural - urban migrants seeking for job has worsened the already

scasce employment opportunity in big cities, which in turn caused increased number

(3).

of unemployeds, beggars, street children, street singers, child labours, vagrants,

street vendors, prostitutes, delinquents, slum dwellers, street crimes, etc.

Worsened living condition of vulnerable persons (destitute children, elderly,

disabled persons, etc) living in public and private institution, in the families, or in

communities.

(4).

(5).

Increased incidences of destitution, delinquency, drug addiction, illegal drug   trafficking and selling, child abuse, women abuse, and sexual abuse.

Increased crimes in terms of number of criminals involved,

rate, crime clock, crime cruelty, crime losts and crime victims, rape, robbery, forceful

types of crime, crime

theft, injurious robbery, mass destruction of public facilities and private properties,

plundering, and murder.

(6).

m

Increased social unrest, social disorder, and social conflicts covering senior high

school students group fightings (in Jakarta), riots (in Jakarta and other cities),

intervillage group fightings (in Jakarta ; Cirebon, West Java ; Pekalongan, Central   -.

Java ; and other places) ; interreligious group conflicts (in Jakarta ; Tasikmalaya, West

Java ; Ambon, Maluku), interethnic conflicts (in Sambas, West Kalimantan ; Ambon,

Maluku), political rebellion (Aceh), and massacre (Banyuwangi, East Java). Those all

had caused lost of lives ; lost of parents and family members ; lost of belongings,

jobs, and source of income; hundred thousands of people particularly women,

children, and elderly displaced and became refugees; unsufferable suffering, and

posttraumatic syndrome.

Declined service capacity of the existing nongovernmental social service institutions

to provide services for vulnerable people, particularly destitute children, elderly, and

disabled persons, because of declined or withdrawn financial support from their

donors.

(8). Declined community and neighbourhood voluntary activities due to most of the

people’s time and energy are drained for earning additional income to survive their

families.

(9). Overburdened governmental and nongovernmental social welfare institutional and

noninstitutional services. Increased number of vulnerable people being affected by or

the victims of the crisis has undoubtedly increased the burden of the existing

governmental and nongovernmental service institutions, programs, and activities.

III. CLOSURE

51. Since July 1997 Indonesia - a country that once renown in achieving decades of rapid

growth, stability, and poverty reduction - has been caught in the monetary, economic,

political, and social crisis. Over the last two years, Indonesia has fallen from ascendant region

superpower to an economic basket case. No country in recent history, let alone one the size of

Indonesia, has ever suffered such a dramatic reversal of fortune.

The several crisis hit Indonesia has victimized the vuluarables, including women, children,

the elderly, small farmers and farm workers, food crop farmers, small traders, goldsmiths,

potters, construction workers, fixed income earners, independent service workers, poultry

and husbandry owners, blue collar workers, and other. Only very few groups of people

benefited from the crisis. They are, among others, fishermen and export crop farmers. At

present, the people are in the situation of anxiety, stress, frustration, uncertainty, and

hopelessness. -.

52. The impacts of the crisis on politics, economy, poverty, employment, education, food

security and nutrition, health, education, environment, women, children, the elderly, and

other social problems had been presented in this paper. From the afore - mentioned

presentation it can be concluded that Indonesia is really in deep crisis. The Indonesian

government, civil society, and people are making every effort to overcome the plethora of

problems caused by the crisis. It is not an easy job ; it is a very hard struggle amidst of

political, social, and economic instability. Anyhow, Indonesia must be able to overcome it

problems as soon as possible in order to realize a humane society which is just, democratic,

prosperous and abiding human rights. Maybe, Indonesia cannot solve its problems alone

Indonesian people sincerely invite cooperation with other people in the world, international

organizations, and other parties to give more strength in overcoming the crisis. Indonesian

people must work hard and smart and be able to make the struggle in overcoming the crisis a

success, since there is no better substitute for success.
