E&OE……………………….…………………………………………………………………

KARL STEFANOVIC:

Good morning, Tony.

TONY ABBOTT:

‘morning Karl.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

Thank you very much being with us. Can I ask you first of all this morning about the Darwin solution? The  Government plans to build a new 1,500 bed detention centre to house asylum seekers in Darwin. In the hotel  business, Tony, you only expand if you’re expecting more business.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, that’s right Karl. There’s only one solution to this particular problem and that's to stop the boats. And  the boats will just keep coming unless the Government changes policy. Now, I guess the particular detention  centre that they're opening in Darwin is, it’s yet another broken promise and this year already we've seen  three broken promises. They said there would be no more onshore detention centres and plainly there are.  They said there would be a federal take over of hospitals and plainly there's not going to be and then, of  course, there's the carbon tax which was the ultimate broken promise which we've been debating all week in  Parliament.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

They didn’t really have a choice though, did they? East Timor is not going to work out.

TONY ABBOTT:

No, and obviously the Prime Minister of Malaysia is as unimpressed about the so-called East Timor solution  as every other regional leader.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

Alright. It's been pretty fiery in Parliament this week, in fact it's been a while since we saw it so fiery. Let's  have a look.

JULIA GILLARD:

The Australian people are better than you are. They are confident people who are rejecting your  race baiting.

HARRY JENKINS:

Order! Order! Order!

TONY ABBOTT:

Mr Speaker, the Prime Minister accused members of this side of the house of a deeply offensive and  untrue political tactic and she should withdraw.

HARRY JENKINS:

Order!

KARL STEFANOVIC:

Tony, are you a race baiter?

TONY ABBOTT:

Absolutely not. This was a low and contemptible slur, the Prime Minister shouldn't have said that and I'm  pleased that the Speaker made her withdraw.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

Do you think some of your members in the parliament are race-baiters?

TONY ABBOTT:

Absolutely not. Look, a couple of weeks ago a couple of my members said things that they shouldn't have  said and they swiftly acknowledged that and recanted as they should have.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

They were, at the time it did look like they were race baiting.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, as I said Karl, both of them are deeply apologetic for having said what shouldn't have been said.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

Overall, Tony, do you reckon this is what Australians really need to be seeing at this point and I know, I  know this, the carbon tax and what to do about the situation is extremely important for this country's future

but there are a lot of other issues that are very important at the moment, there’s a lot of pressure as you know  on household budgets, there’s a lot of pressure on small businesses. Is it not better for the parliament to be  spending their time trying to satisfy some of those needs before carbon tax and to pour a little bit more effort  into things like hospitals?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, Karl, you are right. There is pressure on household budgets and there is pressure on small businesses  and the carbon tax is just going to make it worse and that is why this carbon tax issue is so important. Not  only is it a terrible breach of faith with the public but it is going to radically transform the way people live.  Basically, this is an economy changing and a lifestyle changing tax. It's meant to be. It’s meant to make it  almost impossible to turn on your air conditioner, it’s meant to make it much more expensive to drive your  car. It's meant to stop people digging up coal and burning it for power. It's meant to close down emission  intensive industries like steel and aluminium. This is the very purpose of the tax and that's why it is so  important that the Government never introduce a tax like this without first seeking a strong mandate and  that's what we haven’t got.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

Alright. So without first seeking a strong mandate, are you guaranteeing you will never introduce a carbon  tax if you end up in Government?

TONY ABBOTT:

I am, Karl. The point I make is that the Coalition is against it today, tomorrow, next week, next month, next  year. We will be against it in opposition, we will be against it in government. We will oppose it in  opposition, we will rescind it in government. This is a bad tax and it should not be introduced. It should  certainly not be introduced by a parliament that has no mandate.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

Alright. Independent MP Tony Windsor released, we know there's a lot of heat in this argument, this voice  message on his phone to the media. We’ll take a look back at that.

VOICEMAIL: You're a f…. dog. A big f…. MP dog, doing nothing. You’re there for nothing you  f….. idiot. And you wait. You’re not going to get voted in again [inaudible]. I hope you die, you  bastard.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

So, Tony, do you think there's too much heat in politics at the moment and do you think there’s too much  heat being generated by so-called shock jocks?

TONY ABBOTT:

Karl, people should never leave those sorts of messages on anyone's voicemail. They shouldn't, certainly  shouldn't utter that kind of threatening language to a legislator. They shouldn't do it. Look, there needs to be  a popular revolt against a very bad tax but people's unhappiness needs to be expressed in the ordinary  Australian way and that is by emailing the MP, calling up the MP but talking civilly to him. If necessary,  attending a rally. If you feel like it, there's no reason why you can't buttonhole your MP and say ‘hey, hang  on a minute, why didn't you talk to us about this before the election rather than foist it upon us now’. But our  political debate has to be conducted in the ordinary Australian way and sure that’s robust but in the end it’s  respectful.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

Agreed and certainly that is going too far. I also think Sophie Mirabella, by the way, went too far in likening  the PM to Libyan dictator Colonel Gaddafi. We'll leave that for a moment. I think you’re already on the  record. But let’s talk about, finally, on a lighter note, Liberal Senator Mary-Jo Fisher. Let’s have a look at  her yesterday.

MARY-JO FISHER: You do the hokey pokey and oh! You turn right around. And you know what  happens when you turn around? You're back to where you were before. You put your hands on your  hips and you bring your knees in tight. Because the Prime Minister is going to have to do that, Mr  Acting Deputy President. It’s the pelvic thrust that’s going to really drive the Australian people  insane.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

Now, in all seriousness, Tony, are you going to censure her?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, look, I think it was a pretty quirky performance but I think she’s was just trying to get the point across  that this is a pretty crazy tax! And in the end, that's right, it’s not going to be good for people. I think that  was the point and she was demonstrating it by her actions.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

So you think it was good for her?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, look, she's promised me she will learn a few new dance moves.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

Alright, Tony Abbott, she desperately needs that. I would get on to that as quickly as you possibly can.  Always good to talk to you, thanks for your time this morning.

TONY ABBOTT:

Thanks Karl, thanks Lisa, thanks Ben and thanks team, nice to be here. Where is Julia? Why isn't she here?

KARL STEFANOVIC:

Well, she’s doing the hokey pokey. See you soon mate.
