ALAN TUDGE MUST STAND UP FOR MULTICULTURALISM

The Acting Minister for Immigration, Citizenship, Migrant Services and  Multicultural Affairs, Alan Tudge, must condemn offensive remarks made by the  Queensland LNP spokesperson for Multicultural Affairs, John-Paul Langbroek.

It’s extraordinary that a Shadow Minister for Multicultural Affairs in 2020 would  say ‘in Australia we pride ourselves on our assimilation’.

Even more so that he would do so at a citizenship ceremony, whilst also telling  new citizens not to bring ‘their problems here’.

This isn’t just offensive, but also traumatic to the people Australia has  welcomed as refugees, fleeing persecution.

The Prime Minister and Minister Tudge often speak of Australia as being the  world’s most successful multicultural nation - they are right to do so.

But pride in our multiculturalism must also mean standing up for it. It means  recognising the enormous contribution that migrants and new citizens make to  our society and our economy.

Alan Tudge has a responsibility to support social cohesion and multicultural  communities.

This means that he must, today, rebuke the comments of the Queensland LNP  spokesperson.

Consistent national leadership in standing up for multiculturalism and  multicultural communities is required.

As is supporting a new, national anti-racism campaign.





Labor believes that every Australian is entitled to respect, to be proud of who  they are, and to go about their life free from racism and discrimination.
