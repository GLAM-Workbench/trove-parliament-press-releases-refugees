TEACHERS TO ZIMBABWE

Australian teachers and their dependants going to

Zimbabwe as part of an aid program will get there in time -

thanks to the Royal Australian Air Force.

A RAAF Boeing 707 has been chartered for the

flight, as the airlines which operate scheduled direct flights

between Australia and South Africa will not have enough

seats available by the deadline date.

,  The Boeing 707 is expected to leave Mascot on

January 10, picking up passengers at Sydney, Melbourne and

Perth - about 120 in all.

The Department of Foreign Affairs, which chartered

the aircraft as part of a special-aid pact between Australia

and Zimbabwe, will pay about $193,000 for the flight. The

cost of sending the teachers and their dependants a few at a

time, by circuitous routes,  on other scheduled airlines would

be up to about $280,000.

Transport tasks comprise the bulk .of the work

performed by 37 Squadron, which flies the 707s out of Richmond.

But the biggest single percentage goes toward RAAF training -

35 per cent.

Other figures on the work of the 707s are: Defence

support, including the transport of military personnel (three

Services) to and from exercises - 20 per cent; scheduled tasks,

meaning the carriage of RAAF personnel and their families to

and from RAAF Base Butterworth, in Malaysia - 20 per cent;

national commitments, mainly the transport of refugees - 4

per cent and special transport for the Governor-General,

the Prime Minister and Government Ministers - 21 per cent.

(These figures apply from April 1979 to November 1980, inclusive).

QANTAS, Ansett and TAA were approached initially

over the special charter but told the Department of Foreign

Affairs that they would not have any aircraft available in

time.

The use of RAAF transport is being made strictly

on an emergency* basis and regular charters of this sort

are not envisaged.
