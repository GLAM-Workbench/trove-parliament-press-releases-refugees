E&OE…

TOM ELLIOTT:

Joining us now on the line from Canberra, the Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.

Mr Turnbull, good afternoon.

PRIME MINISTER:

Hey, good afternoon Tom.

TOM ELLIOTT:

Okay the deal with the American Administration now led by Donald Trump to resettle  all of AustraliaÃ¢ÂÂs refugees on Manus and Nauru. Is that deal going to go ahead?

PRIME MINISTER:

LetÃ¢ÂÂs just be clear about this. The deal that was entered into with President Obama  was for the Americans to process and consider for acceptance of refugees. So it wasnÃ¢ÂÂt  a commitment to take everybody sight unseen or anything like that. It was always  premised on their very rigorous processing. So the position is, I spoke to President  Trump on Sunday morning our time. The President in the course of that conversation

committed to honour the refugee resettlement deal that had been entered into by  President Obama.

On Wednesday morning our time, the PresidentÃ¢ÂÂs spokesman, Sean Spicer, who is his  official spokesman, confirmed in the White House briefing room, that the President  had given that commitment and the arrangements would go forward. Today, in  Canberra, the United States Embassy stated that President TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs decision to honour  the refugee agreement has not changed and spokesman SpicerÃ¢ÂÂs comments stand.  They add that this was reconfirmed by the State Department from the White House  and also the Embassy at 1.15pm Canberra time.

So that is the basis, that is the communications that weÃ¢ÂÂve had; a commitment made  by the President on Sunday, confirmed by his spokesman, official spokesman on  Wednesday and confirmed by his Embassy in Canberra today.

TOM ELLIOTT:

Okay, but you say that last confirmation was received at 1.15pm today Canberra time.  An hour and 15 minutes ago at five to three, Donald Trump via Twitter - where he  loves to announce things - said this:

“Do you believe it? The Obama Administration agreed to take thousands of illegal  immigrants from Australia. Why? I will study this dumb deal.”

Now those words do not sound like a deal that is still being done.

PRIME MINISTER:

Well we have a clear commitment. I have a clear commitment from the President. As I  said, it has been confirmed by his spokesman. It has confirmed by his Embassy acting  on the authority of the White House. We expect the deal, that the commitment will  continue, and it is certainly clear, the commitment has been made and we expect it to  continue.

TOM ELLIOTT:

Is there a plan Ã¢ÂÂBÃ¢ÂÂ if it doesnÃ¢ÂÂt go ahead?

PRIME MINISTER:

Our expectation naturally, given the commitments that have been made, is that it will  go ahead but we are always seeking to find resettlement options for the people on  Nauru and Manus. The only option that isnÃ¢ÂÂt available to them, is bringing them to  Australia for the obvious reasons that that would provide a signal to the people  smugglers to get back into business.

TOM ELLIOTT:

But is there a plan Ã¢ÂÂBÃ¢ÂÂ? Have you, for example, spoken to, I donÃ¢ÂÂt know, New Zealand  or Malaysia or some other country?

PRIME MINISTER:

We are always looking at resettlement options, but we donÃ¢ÂÂt comment on them until  such time as agreements are made.

TOM ELLIOTT:

The nature of your phone call with President Trump. It has been widely reported in the  media that he shouted at you and hung up on you. Is that true?

PRIME MINISTER:

The call. Firstly, let me say I am very disappointed about the leak in Washington of  what purports to be details about the call. But I can confirm to you that the report that  the President hung up on me is not correct.

TOM ELLIOTT:

Not correct?

PRIME MINISTER:

That is not correct. The call ended courteously.

TOM ELLIOTT:

Was it cut short?

PRIME MINISTER:

The call ended courteously, thatÃ¢ÂÂs all I want to say about that. It was 25-minute call. It  covered a number of issues, but the bulk of the time was spent on the refugee  resettlement deal.

TOM ELLIOTT:

So your position is - and you believe this - that the deal is still going ahead with  America, with the Trump Administration?

PRIME MINISTER:

Well we have, literally a couple of hours ago, it was confirmed by the Embassy in  Canberra. Obviously the commitment was made to me by the President himself in a  phone call on Sunday. And it was confirmed by his official spokesman on Wednesday  and we expect the officials on both sides will work to ensure the deal goes ahead.

But can I just make this clear? The suggestion in some, you know, parts of the media  that - and I make no criticism here - this may just be a misunderstanding, the  suggestion that this involves taking refugees sight unseen, is wrong. It has always  been based on the premise that the United States Homeland Security officials would  undertake the very, very rigorous screening and vetting procedures that they do with  any applicants for refugee status, to go to the United States.

TOM ELLIOTT:

So conceivably, letÃ¢ÂÂs say the deal does go ahead. They could look at the 1250 odd  refugees and maybe agree to take half of them, but the other half would still be left on  Manus and/or Nauru?

PRIME MINISTER:

Well it is possible that they could take a smaller number or a larger number. Naturally  in an agreement like this, the parties would act in good faith. But that will depend of  the assessments being made by the American officials. YouÃ¢ÂÂve got to remember what  weÃ¢ÂÂre seeking to do here, Tom, these are people - there are several thousand refugees,  most of whom have been given refugee status - on Nauru and Manus, theyÃ¢ÂÂre there  because the Labor Party put them there. Because the Labor Party could not keep our  borders secure. Those people were put there by Kevin Rudd for the most part, and we  have been working hard to find resettlement options for them. TheyÃ¢ÂÂve obviously got  an option in Cambodia, actually they can stay on a 20-year visa in Nauru, they can  resettle in PNG if theyÃ¢ÂÂre in Manus. But weÃ¢ÂÂve also been seeking other options for  them and thatÃ¢ÂÂs why we sought, and obtained, the agreement from the United States  Government last year.

TOM ELLIOTT:

Do you find Donald Trump personally difficult to deal with?

PRIME MINISTER:

Again, as AustraliaÃ¢ÂÂs Prime Minister itÃ¢ÂÂs my job to stand up for Australia, to advance  AustraliaÃ¢ÂÂs national interests. IÃ¢ÂÂve dealt with many people over the years and IÃ¢ÂÂve  found IÃ¢ÂÂve enjoyed my dealings with President Trump. WeÃ¢ÂÂve had very frank, very  forthright discussions in which each of us have expressed our views frankly, as good  friends should, and I always stand up for AustraliaÃ¢ÂÂs interests, thatÃ¢ÂÂs my job. My job is

to defend AustraliaÃ¢ÂÂs national interest. ItÃ¢ÂÂs not to indulge in commentary. It is to  defend and advance AustraliaÃ¢ÂÂs interests.

TOM ELLIOTT:

But one of our big interests, of course, is the maintenance of the US-Australian  Alliance which has been around since World War Two. Do you think thatÃ¢ÂÂs in good  hands right now? Is it still strong?

PRIME MINISTER:

The Alliance is absolutely rock solid. It is so strong and it is based on 65 years of  history, in terms of the Alliance in a formal sense. But you know, ever since World  War One, Australians have fought side by side in Americans in every major conflict.  Our Alliance is built on commitments, on service, on courage, on partnership of  millions of Australians and Americans going back generations. It will continue and  strengthen during my time as Prime Minister and, IÃ¢ÂÂm sure, during President TrumpÃ¢ÂÂs  time as President. It will continue for many generations after that.

TOM ELLIOTT:

Malcolm Turnbull, thank you for your time, the Prime Minister.
