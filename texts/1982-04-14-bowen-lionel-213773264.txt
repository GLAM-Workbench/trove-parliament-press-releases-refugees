ADDRESS TO NEWCASTLE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE & INDUSTRY

MADE AT SHORTLAND ROOM, BROWN STREET, NEWCASTLE ON

WEDNESDAY 1A APRIL 1982

FOR TOO LONG AUSTRALIA'S FOREIGN POLICY HAS BEEN DICTATED

BY WHAT HAD BEEN DECIDED IN LONDON, WASHINGTON AND TOKYO.

THE TIME IS LONG OVERDUE WHEN AUSTRALIA MUST PRODUCE A POLICY

WHICH IS MADE IN AUSTRALIA, WITH QUR COUNTRY'S BEST INTERESTS

IN THE FOREFRONT.

THIS DOES NOT MEAN THAT WE PLAN TO TURN OUR BACKS ON OUR

FRIENDS OF LONG STANDING, OR THAT AUSTRALIA WILL "GO IT  ALONE"

AND IGNORE WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE WORLD'S MAJOR CAPITALS.

ON THE CONTRARY, AUSTRALIA NEEDS TO BE BETTER INFORMED ON WHAT

IS HAPPENING IN THE WORLD SO THAT IT  CAN BEST FORMULATE ITS OWN

ASSESSMENT OF INTERNATIONAL EVENTS AND DECIDEJ/HAT COURSE OF

ACTION IT  MUST FOLLOW. .

Ã¢ÂÂ¢  i 2/

THERE WAS SOMETHING FAINTLY LUDICROUS, FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE

PRIME MINISTER'S SHUTTLE V IS IT S  TO WASHINGTON AT THE BEGINNING ‘

OF THE AFGHAN CRISIS LAST YEAR.

AUSTRALIA IS A MIDDLE-SIZED POWER WITH LIMITED RESOURCES,

BOTH OF MANPOWER AND OF MONEY, AND WE MUST ORDER OUR PRIORITIES

SO THAT THESE CAN BE DEPLOYED AS EFFECTIVELY AND AS ADVANTAGEOUSLY

AS POSSIBLE. FLYING BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS TO WASHINGTON ON

AN ERRAND WHICH INVOLVED THE U .S . AND THE USSR AND A FAR OFF

COUNTRY WHICH IS OF ONLY MARGINAL INTEREST TO AUSTRALIA IS

POINTLESS. THAT IS NOT TO T R IV IA LIZ E  THE SOVIET INVASION OF

AFGHANISTAN, BUT MERELY TO PUT IT  INTO PERSPECTIVE.

WE MUST CONDEMN PUBLICLY THE INFRINGEMENT OF SOVEREIGNTY, THE

DESTRUCTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS, THE CALLOUS DISREGARD FOR WORLD

OPINION SHOWN BY THE SOVIETS AND THEIR PUPPETS, AND ASSIST

WHERE WE CAN BY PROVIDING FOOD AID FOR THE MILLIONS OF REFUGEES

WHO HAVE GONE TO PAKISTAN. TO BEHAVE AS IF  WE WERE A PARTY

PRINCIPAL IN THIS AFFAIR IS S ILL Y .

...3/

r .

AUSTRALIA IS ABOUT 15% DEPENDENT ON EXPORTS FOR ITS EARNINGS.

WE NEED TO EXPORT IF  WE ARE TO GROW. WE NEED TO FIND OUTLETS

FOR OUR MANUFACTURED GOODS AND NOT JUST FOR OUR RAW MATERIALS,

THOUGH THOSE TOO MUST BE COMPETITIVELY MARKETED.

EXPORT MARKETING AND FINANCING IS , EACH YEAR MORE COMPLEX AND

COMPETITIVE. LOW WAGE COUNTRIES ARE BROADENING THEIR RANGE

OF EXPORTS. HIGHLY INDUSTRIALISED COUNTRIES SUCH AS JAPAN

ARE FIERCE IN THE COMPETITION THAT THEY PROVIDE.

Ã¢ÂÂ   Ã¢ÂÂ   # ' . . Ã¢ÂÂ

THEY HAVE.A HIGH DEGREE OF COORDINATION BETWEEN GOVERNMENT

AND INDUSTRY AND THE COUNTRY IS OFTEN REFERRED TO AS 'JAPAN

INCORPORATED."

IT 'S  NO USE SAYING THAT THEIR SOCIETY IS OPPRESSIVE AND THAT

THEIR WAYS ARE NOT OUR WAYS. WHEN IT  COMES TO THE INTERNATIONAL

MARKETPLACE WE MUST COMPETE ON THEIR TERMS IF  WE EXPECT TO WIN.

. . ÃÂ /

4

AUSTRALIA, FOR EXAMPLE, IS WELL PLACED BECAUSE OF ITS

SKILLED LABOUR FORCE, TO COMPETE IN HIGH TECHNOLOGY EXPORTS.

WHEN WE SPEAK OF FOREIGN POLICY TODAY, WE MEAN INCREASINGLY

"FOREIGN ECONOMIC POLICY". NEVER HAS IT  BEEN REALLY POSSIBLE

TO SEPARATE COMMERCE FROM POLITICS, TRADE HAS ALWAYS FOLLOWED

THE FLAG.

TODAY, COMMERCE, ECONOMICS AND POLITICS ARE VERY CLOSELY INTERÂ­

TWINED AND WE NEED TO HAVE MACHINERY WHICH IS EQUAL TO THE

TASK DEMANDED OF IT . .

WE NEED TO REORGANISE FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN ORDER TO

BETTER EXPLOIT AUSTRALIA'S MAJOR ECONOMIC AND EMPLOYMENT

OPPORTUNITIES.

WE NEED TO HELP EXPORTERS TO CONFRONT SUCCESSFULLY TOUGH TRADE

COMPETITION ABROAD. WE MUST INCREASE OUR EXPORT DRIVE IN

ORDER TO ALLOW OUR INDUSTRIES TO EXPAND, TO MODERNIZE AND TO

PROVIDE JOBS FOR YOUNG AUSTRALIANS.

...5/

5

THERE MUST BE A CLOSER COORDINATION OF ECONOMY-RELATED

DEPARTMENTS WITHIN THE GOVERNMENT IN ORDER TO MAKE THEM MORE

SENSITIVE AND RESPONSIVE TO ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ISSUES IN

THE VARIOUS PARTS OF AUSTRALIA.

THESE AREAS MUST BE MADE TO WORK CLOSELY WITH THE CENTRAL

GOVERNMENT IN. ORDER THAT THE EFFORT IS BETTER CO-ORDINATED SO

THAT WE DON'T UNDERCUT ONE ANOTHER BUT CAN HOLD OUR OWN AGAINST

OUR OVERSEAS COMPETITORS.

THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF THE VARIOUS REGIONS OF AUSTRALIA

IS A COMPLEX ISSUE WHICH, IN THE SHADOW CABINET, IS  RECEIVING

THE ATTENTION OF THOSE WHOSE PORTFOLIOS HAVE AN ECONOMIC B IA S .

WHAT I AM CONCERNED ABOUT IS IMPLEMENTING IN IT IA T IV E S  WHICH

WILL INCREASE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S CAPACITY TO PURSUE

AGGRESSIVELY INTERNATIONAL EXPORT MARKETS FOR THE GOODS PRODUCED

BY EVERY REGION IN THIS COUNTRY, BE THEY RESOURCE PRODUCTS,  . v

MANUFACTURED GOODS OR SERVICES.

...6/

MUCH GREATER WEIGHT MUST BE ATTACHED TO ECONOMIC FACTORS

IN THE DESIGN OF FOREIGN POLICY AND THE CONDUCT OF OUR FOREIGN

RELATIONS TO ENSURE THAT THEY SERVE AUSTRALIA'S OBJECTIVES,

THIS DOES NOT MEAN THAT OUR RELATIONS WITH THE REST OF THE

WORLD WILL BE CONDUCTED SOLELY IN THE MARKETPLACE. IT  DOES

NOT MEAN THAT WE SHALL IGNORE THE PO LITICAL, CULTURAL AND

SOCIAL ASPECTS OF OUR RELATIONS WITH OTHER COUNTRIES.

IN A COMPLEX WORLD WHERE CLEAR CUT DIVISIONS NO LONGER EXIST,

WE MUST RATIONALISE AND HARMONISE OUR EFFORTS AT FOREIGN DEALING

IF  WE ARE TO SUCCEED IN LOOKING AFTER OUR INTERESTS. COUNTRIES

DO NOT HAVE PERMANENT FRIENDS AND ENEMIES, ONLY PERMANENT

INTERESTS.

FOREIGN RELATIONS ARE FLUID AND NEED CAREFUL MONITORING.

TRADE MATTERS ARE BECOMING MORE CLOSELY CONNECTED WITH PO LITICAl

MATTERS AS GOVERNMENTS ARE BECOMING MORE ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN 1

TRADE. AUSTRALIA MUST SPEAK WITH A STRONG UNIFIED VOICE ABROAI

WHEN IT  SPEAKS TO FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS ON MATTERS OF CONCERN TO

OUR PRODUCERS AND MANUFACTURERS.

7

THE DEPARTMENT OF

WE NEED TO RESTRUCTURE/FOREIGN AFFAIRS TO ENABLE IT  TO PURSUE :

AGGRESSIVELY AUSTRALIA'S EXPORT MARKETS SO AS TO GIVE PROPER

WEIGHT 10 ECONOMIC MATTERS WHEN FORMULATING FOREIGN PO LIC Y.

THE REORGANISATION WE PROPOSE W ILL BE ACHIEVED WITHOUT INCREASING

THE SIZE OF THE-GOVERNMENT OR THE COST OF THE PRESENT OPERATION.

THERE MAY EVEN BE CONSIDERABLE SAVINGS WHEN THE PRESENT DUPLICATIC

OF EFFORT IS STOPPED. HOWEVER, THE MAIN OBJECTIVE I S  NOT TO

REDUCE SPENDING AS SUCH BUT TO SPEND WHAT IS NECESSARY TO ENABLE

AUSTRALIA'S LNTERESJSTO BE SAFEGUARDED.

REORGANISATION WILL ENSURE THAT COMPETENT STAFF W ILL NOT BE

LAID. OFF OR DECLARED REDUNDANT.

TO DEAL WITH THE ECONOMIC ASPIRATIONS OF THE STATES, THE DEPARTÂ­

MENT OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS WILL ESTABLISH A BRANCH RESPONSIBLE

FOR CO-ORDINATION WITH THE STATE GOVERNMENTS, WHICH W ILL  BE PER -Ã¢ÂÂ¢ ‘ .  .  Â» Â»Â·

SUADED TO CLOSE THEIR OVERSEAS OFFICES.

THESE PSEUDO-EMBASSIES COST THE AUSTRALIAN TAXPAYER DEARLY

THOUGH‘THE STATES ARE NOT FORTHCOMING IN REVEALING WHAT

THESE MISSIONS COST.

AUSTRALIAN STATES NO LONGER NEED AGENTS-GENERAL IN LONDON. ’

FURTHERMORE, THE STATES WHICH HAVE OFFICES IN TOKYO —  (NEW

SOUTH WALES, VICTORIA, QUEENSLAND, SOUTH AUSTRALIA AND WESTERN

AUSTRALIA) -  DO US A DISSERVICE, AS THEY COMPETE WITH ONE

ANOTHER INSTEAD OF PRESENTING TO THE JAPANESE A UNITED AUSTRALIAN

FRONT. Ã¢ÂÂ Â·

IF  WE ASK THE STATES TO CLOSE DOWN THEIR OFFICES, WE MUST ENSURE

THAT OUR EMBASSIES ARE ADEQUATELY STAFFED TO PROVIDE THE

SERVICES WHICH THE STATES NEED TO DEVELOP THEIR EXPORT ECONOMIES.

THE DEPARTMENTS OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE MAINTAIN SEPARATE

OFFICES IN EACH OF THE STATE CAPITALS.

THE STATE FOREIGN AFFAIRS OFFICES AND TRADE OFFICES SHOULD BE

COMBINED AND GIVEN A REAL ROLE TO PLAY.

9

THE STATES HAVE TO KNOW WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND

AUSTRALIA ARE DOING AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MUST KNOW WHAT

THE NEEDS OF THE STATES ARE.

THIS W ILL ALSO ENSURE THE MAXIMUM COORDINATION BETWEEN A ID

PROGRAMMES AND AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRY. A LARGE NUMBER- OF AUSTRALIAI

PRODUCED GOODS ARE ALREADY SENT OVERSEAS AS A ID , BUT WE MUST

ENSURE THAT TH IS VALUABLE TOOL OF FOREIGN POLICY IS  CLOSELY

GUIDED TO BENEFIT AUSTRALIAN MANUFACTURERS AND PRODUCERS AS WELL

AS THE A ID  RECIPIENTS. .

THE TRADE COMMISSIONER SERVICE SHOUUDBE MOVED TO FOREIGN AFFAIRS,

THUS STRENGTHENING THE OVERSEAS SERVICE AS A WHOLE AND BRINGING .

UNDER ONE ROOF THE ADMINISTRATION OF OFFICERS WHO SERVE ABROAD.

TRADE COMMISSIONERS AND FOREIGN SERVICE OFFICERSWOULD HAVE THE

ONE DESIGNATION AND WORK CLOSELY TOGETHER BOTH ABROAD AND

IN STAFFING THE DEPARTMENT AT HOME. THIS WOULD. ENSURE THAT

THERE IS  A GREAT DEAL OF COHESIVENESS IN COMMERCIAL AND ECONOMIC

WORK AND THAT PO LITICAL CONSIDERATIONS ARE KEPT IN  M IN D .-

10

WHAT AUSTRALIA WOULD EVENTUALLY HAVE IS  A UN I FED PROFESSIONAL

OVERSEAS CAREER SERVICE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL THE

MAJOR ASPECTS OF AUSTRALIA'S DEALINGS WITH THE REST OF THE

WORLD -  COMMERCIAL, ECONOMIC, PO LITIC A L AND CULTURAL.

i n O rder  t o s t a f f  t h e d e p a r t m e n t  w it h  th e c o m p e t e n t  p e o p l e  we wo

NEED, THERE WILL HAVE TO BE AN EXTENSIVE PROGRAMME OF SECONDMENT

FROM DOMESTIC DEPARTMENTS AND FROM STATE GOVERNMENTS, AS WELL

AS FROM PRIVATE ENTERPRISE.

OFFICERS WITH EXPERIENCE ABROAD WOULD- BE TRANSFERRED IN  TURN TO

THE HOME DEPARTMENTS AND SECONDED TO BUSINESS FIRMS. HOWEVER,

THE JURISDICTION AND CONTROL OF AUSTRALIA'S BUSINESS ABROAD

WOULD! REST WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS.

PERMANENCY OF TENURE IN KEY POLICY DEPARTMENTS MUST END. JOB

SECURITY CAN BE GUARANTEED ONLY AT THE LOWER ECHELONS AS THE

MANAGERS OF THE PUBLIC SERVICE MUST, LIK E  ALL MANAGERS, EARN

THEIR POSITION AND WORK TO RETAIN IT .

FUNCTIONAL D IVISIO N S TO ENSURE THAT THE LEFT HAND KNOWS WHAT

THE RIGHT IS  DOING.

THE REGIONAL OFFICERS WOULD PLAY KEY ROLES IN PROVIDING FEEDBACK

THERE WERE A NUMBER OF REASONS FOR THE EXPECTATIONS THAT THERE

WOULD BE A MAJOR UPSURGE IN RESOURCES-BASED PROJECTS.

AUSTRALIA IS A POLITICALLY STABLE COUNTRY, WITH VAST MINERAL

AND ENERGY RESOURCES, AND A GENERALLY UNCRITICAL ATTITUDE

TO FOREIGN INVESTMENT.

*Ã¢ÂÂ

FOR THE LARGE COMPANIES WHICH DOMINATE THE WORLD MINERAL AND

ENERGY INDUSTRIES, AUSTRALIA LOOKED LIK E  A VERY PROFITABLE

PLACE TO INVEST.

THIS WAS ACCENTUATED BY TWO FACTORS. THE RISING PRICE OF LIQUID

FUELS IN OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD HAD BEGUN TO MAKE INDUSTRIES

BASED ON SUCH FUELS LESS ECONOMIC,—  NOTABLY ALUMINIUM SMELTERS

RELIANT ON ELECTRICITY GENERATED IN O IL-FIR E D  POWER STATIONS.

-15-

WITH ITS VAST AND RELATIVELY ACCESSIBLE COAL RESOURCES, AUSTRALIA

WAS A LOGICAL PLACE TO SHIFT SUCH INDUSTRIES. AS A RESULT,

WE SAW PLANS FOR A MAJOR RESTRUCTURING OF THE JAPANESE ALUMINIUM

SMELTING INDUSTRY AND ITS PARTIAL RELOCATION IN AUSTRALIA.

THE OTHER FACTOR WAS THE GENERALLY MORE CRITICAL ATTITUDE TAKEN

TO TRANSNATIONAL COMPANIES IN OTHER MINERAL/ENERGY-PRODUCING

COUNTRIES.

MANY OTHER COUNTRIES HAD MOVED TO GAIN A GREATER SHARE OF THE

BENEFITS PRODUCED BY FOREIGN COMPANIES, EITHER THROUGH HIGHER

TAXATION AND ROYALTIES, GOVERNMENT OWNERSHIP, INTERVENTION

IN MINERAL MARKETING, OR NATIONALISATIONS.

IN ADDITION, STRICTER CONTROLS RELATING TO THE ENVIRONMENT WERE

BEING IMPOSED ON THE COMPANIES, WHICH CONSIDERABLY INCREASED j

THEIR COSTS OF PRODUCTION. '

AUSTRALIA. ON THE OTHER HAND, AS NOTED, HAS GENERALLY ADOPTED

AN UNCRITICAL ATTITUDE OT FOREIGN INVESTMENT, BOTH AT A FEDERAL

AND STATE GOVERNMENT LEVEL. '

-16-

STATE GOVERNMENTS/ IN PARTICULAR, HAVE VIED AGAINST EACH OTHER

TO ATTRACT FOREIGN INVESTMENT, AND HAVE OFTEN, AS A RESULT,

ERODED THEIR BARGAINING POWER AND ULTIMATELY THE BENEFITS

ACCRUING TO THEM. * j  Â·

NO SERIOUS ATTEMPTS HAVE BEEN MADE IN AUSTRALIA, (UNLIKE IN

OTHER COUNTRIES) TO BECOME DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN THE MINERAL

AND ENERGY INDUSTRIES, TO INTERVENE IN THE INTERNATIONAL

MARKETING OF OUR NATURAL RESOURCES, AND TO ATTEMPT TO PROMOTE

A GREATER TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER FROM FOREIGN CONTROLLED PROJECTS.

DESPITE THESE ATTRACTIONS, HOWEVER, IT  HAS ALL STARTED TO

GO SERIOUSLY WRONG. THERE HAS BEEN A SIGNIFICANT SCALING DOWN

OF THE PREDICTED INVESTMENTS, A DEFERRAL OF MANY OF THE NEW

PROJECTS, DELAYS IN THE SIGNING OF CONTRACTS FOR ALREADY COMPLETE

PROJECTS, AND MAJOR REDUCTIONS IN THE EXPECTED NEW EMPLOYMENT Ã¢ÂÂ

OPPORTUNITIES.

EVEN AS LATE AS LAST WEEK ALCAN ANNOUNCED HAT IT  WAS DEFERRING

THE COMMISSIONING OF THE THIRD POTLINE AT ITS KURRI KURRI SMELTER,

DUE TO THE f  .-C  : STATE OF THE WORLD ALUMINIUM INDUSTRY.

THIS IS NOT TO SAY, OF COURSE, THAT THERE WILL BE NO NEW

MINERALS AND ENERGY PROJECTS, BUT CERTAINLY THE PREDICTIONS

OF A YEAR OR SO AGO ARE ALREADY VERY MUCH OUT-OF-DATE.

PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR HAS BEEN THE STATE OF THE

WORLD ECONOMY.

MANY OF THE NEW PROJECTS WERE TO BE BASED ON EXPORT PRODUCTION,

BUT ALREADY THE MAJOR EXPORT MARKETS ARE IN RECESSION. EVEN

THE USUALLY RESILIENT JAPANESE ECONOMY IS  BEGINNING TO DETERIORATE

AS THE WORLD RECESSION DEEPENS. THE POLICIES BEING PURSUED

BY THE PRESENT REAGAN ADMINISTRATION IN THE UNITED STATES, NOTABI

ITS HIGH INTEREST RATE MONETARIST PO LICIES, CAN ONLY MAKE THINGS

WORSE. '

-17-

-18-

IF  THE WORLD ECONOMY DOES INDEED SINK INTO A DEEP DEPRESSION,

AS SOME COMMENTATORS ARE NOW PREDICTING, THEN THERE ARE

GOING TO BE SOME HARD TIMES AHEAD FOR AUSTRALIA.

WE ALREADY HAVE A DISASTROUSLY HIGH LEVEL OF UNEMPLOYMENT AND

UNDER-EMPLOYMENT, WHICH COULD GO HIGHER DURING THE REST OF

THIS YEAR AND IN 1983.

IMPORTANT SECTIONS OF AUSTRALIAN MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY ARE IN

DEEP C R IS IS , AND HAVE BEEN SO SINCE THE M ID -1 9 6 0 's .

FOR THE HUNTER VALLEY REGION, AND NEWCASTLE IN PARTICULAR, IT  1

LIKELY THAT HARD TIMES L IE  AHEAD. BHP IS ALREADY EXPERIENCING

MAJOR DIFFIC ULTIES WITH ITS STEEL OPERATIONS, AND WE ALL KNOW THE

DIFFICULTIES THAT THIS WILL CREATE FOR THE WORKERS AND BUSINESSES

IN NEWCASTLE AND SURROUNDING AREAS. :

SOME NEW PROJECTS IN THE HUNTER VALLEY WILL GO AHEAD, BUT THESE

ARE UNLIKELY TO SOLVE THE SERIOUS SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC PROBLEMS

' OF UNEMPLOYMENT ALREADY PREVALENT.

-19-

AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENTS, STATE AND FEDERAL, ARE GOING TO HAVE

TO BECOME MORE AWARE OF THESE ISSUES. .IN  THE 1 9 3 0 's  and

1 9 4 0 's , THIS COUNTRY FINALLY DECIDED THAT IT  COULD NO LONGER

RELY ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY ON THE EXPORT OF PRIMARY PRODUCTS, AND

MOVED TO DIVERSIFY ITS INDUSTRIAL BASE, TO CATER MORE TO A

GROWING DOMESTIC MARKET.

WE NEED TO LOOK TO THIS SORT OF REASSESSMENT IN THE 1 9 8 0 's

OR ELSE THIS COUNTRY IS GOING TO FIND THAT ITS PEOPLES' LIVING

STANDARDS WILL CEASE TO RISE, AND MAY INDEED BEGIN TO DECLINE.

WE WOULD HOPE THAT WITH AUSTRALIA'S TWO LARGEST STATES UNDER

LABOR GOVERNMENTS, AND WITH A FEDERAL LABOR GOVERNMENT, THAT 1

CO-OPERATION COULD COME TO THE FORE.

THE CONFRONTATION I ST APPROACH OF THE PRESENT FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

IS NO WAY TO DEAL WITH THE VERY SERIOUS PROBLEMS OF THE 1 9 8 Q 's .

WE WOULD HOPE THAT GOVERNMENTS COULD FOSTER NEW INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT

AND ENCOURAGE GREATER AGREEMENT BETWEEN TRADE UNIONS AND EMPLOYERS.

A FORWARD LOOKING INDUSTRIAL STRATEGY IS  REQUIRED. IT  IS

IMPORTANT THAT WITH MANY OF THE EXISTING INDUSTRIES, PARTICULARLY

THE STEEL-INDUSTRY- EXPERIENCING SUCH D I F F I C U L T I E S ^  THE VERY

HIGH LEVELS OF UNEMPLOYMENT PREVAILING AT THE PRESENT TIM E,

THAT CONSTRUCTIVE IDEAS FOR NEW INDUSTRIES BE DEVELOPED.

I BELIEVE WE SHOULD ESTABLISH AN INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT COMMISSION

SOMEWHAT ALONG THE LINES OF THE SECONDARY INDUSTRIES COMMISSION

ESTABLISHED DURING WORLD WAR 1 1.

I WOULD SEE THIS NEW COMMISSION OPERATING, AS DID ITS PREDECESSOR

ALONG THE LINES OF INDUSTRY COUNCILS. SUCH INDUSTRY COUNCILS

WOULD INCLUDE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE MAJOR GROUPS ASSOCIATED WITH

THE INDUSTRY AND CONCERNED ABOUT ITS FUTURE DEVELOPMENT, INCLUDING

STATE GOVERNMENTS,Â· EMPLOYERS AND TRADE UNIONS.

-20-

-21-

SUCH COUNCILS WOULD NOT ONLY DISCUSS THE PRESENT STATE OF THE

INDUSTRY BUT PROPOSALS FOR ITS FUTURE DEVELOPMENT AND GROWTH

PROSPECTS: THIS WOULD INCLUDE DISCUSSIONS OF NEW TECHNOLOGICAL

DEVELOPMENTS, MARKETING ARRANGEMENTS, POSSIBLE SUPPORT TO BE

GIVEN BY THE GOVERNMENTS AND ISSUES OF CONSIDERATION TO

CONSUMERS.

SUCH COUNCILS COULD BE USED FOR BRINGING NEW TECHNOLOGY INTO

AUSTRALIA AND STIMULATING THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW AUSTRALIAN

TECHNOLOGIES.

RECOMMENDATIONS COULD BE MADE FOR THE PROVISION OF VENTURE .

CAPITAL FOR NEW INDUSTRIES OR COMPANIES, WITH NEW TECHNOLOGY,

TO ENABLE NEW DEVELOPMENTS TO PROCEED.

ENCOURAGEMENT COULD BE GIVEN TO THE INVOLVEMENT OF TRADE UNIONS

IN THE PROVISION OF VENTURE CAPITAL TO NEW COMPANIES, PARTICULARLY

THROUGH THE SUPERANNUATION FUNDS OF TRADE UNION MEMBERS.

FINALLY, ENCOURAGEMENT SHOULD BE GIVEN FOR COMPANIES AND

I fOUSTRIES TO BE BROUGHT INTO AGREEMENTS WITH THE TRADE UNION

MOVEMENT. SUCH AGREEMENTS WOULD DIRECLTY ADDRESS ISSUES SUCH Â· ?  .

AS THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW TECHNOLOGY, WORKING CONDITIONS,

HEALTH AND SAFETY AND WORKING HOURS.

THE RECENT AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE M . T . I . A .  AND THE METAL TRADES

UNIONS REPRESENTS THE BEGINNING OF SUCH COMPREHENSIVE INDUSTRY

AGREEMENTS.

IN CONCLUSION, I WOULD LIK E  TO SAY THAT WE WOULD GIVE ENCOURAGI

FOR THE MAJOR GROUPS IN INDUSTRY TO GET TOGETHER AND FORMULATE

PLANS FOR THEIR INDUSTRIES AND THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT APPROPRIA"

GOVERNMENT MACHINERY, AS I HAVE SUGGESTED IN THE FORM OF AN

INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT COMMISSION IS  NECESSARY FOR CO-ORDINATIOf

OF SUCH PLANS. Ã¢ÂÂ
