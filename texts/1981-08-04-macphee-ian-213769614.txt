INDUSTRIAL ACTION. PREVENTS. MIGRANT. .CLASSES. AT FAIRFIELD

Industrial action by the NSW Teachers' Federation against

the Migrant Settlement and Education Centre at Fairfield will

prevent the provision of English classes to a large number of

newly-arrived refugees and migrants in that area.

There has been rapid growth in the numbers of non-English

speaking migrants and refugees settling in the Fairfield region

over recent years. Earlier this year the Commonwealth Government,

in co-operation with the Fairfield City Council,  acted quickly to

meet the special needs of newcomers by establishing a Migrant

Settlement and Education Centre in the area. The Centre opened

on 17 July 1981 and is already providing some settlement services

to migrants.

However,  the NSW Teachers' Federation has not allowed

teachers to provide English language classes at the Centre,  thus

preventing it from assisting newly-arrived migrants in overÂ­

coming one of the most serious settlement problems - the

inability to speak English.

The administration of the Adult Migrant Education Program

has to be kept as flexible as possible to ensure that language

services for migrants are located where needs exist and that

course content is adjusted to meet the changing special requirements

of newly-arrived migrants.

The industrial action by the Teachers' Federation prevents

this.  Â·
