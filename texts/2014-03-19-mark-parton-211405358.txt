MARK PARTON: Richard Marles is a regular part of this program, of course  Immigration spokesperson these days for the Opposition and he’s on the line  right now hello, Richard.

RICHARD MARLES, SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND  BORDER PROTECTION: Good morning, Mark how are you?

PARTON: Excellent, you were in Papua New Guinea last week, the only reason I  know is because you couldn’t come on this program.

MARLES: Indeed.

PARTON: I want to know, when you go there as Immigration spokesperson for  the Opposition, why do you go?

MARLES: Well I went to get a firsthand sense of exactly what’s going on with  the Regional Resettlement Arrangement with Papua New Guinea and particularly  from PNG’s perspective, there’s an understanding of how our Government is  going about this, but I wanted to see how they were feeling about it, how they  were engaged in it and from that point of view I was encouraged, there is a high  degree of political commitment in PNG towards the Regional Resettlement  Arrangement, there are resources being dedicated, they want to see it work and  that’s all good. My concern is that I came away with a distinct impression that  our own Government has really dropped the ball on this and particularly the

element of resettlement which is at the heart of the arrangement, that is  resettling those people that are found to be refugees in PNG, the agreement was  always that Australia would provide support for that, there seems to be precious  little discussion which has been had by our Government with PNG around that  until we saw a crisis happen at Manus and that’s not good enough.

PARTON: You must find yourself in two minds though when you go on a trip  like this because I am of the belief that you’re a genuine politician, you actually  set about on this path because you wanted to make this country better, you  wanted to make your electorate better, but when you go on a trip like that as  Opposition spokesman you are going to help but I guess you’re also going to  knock things down aren’t you? You’re going to have a look at what the hell it is  they’re doing wrong so that you can get back in Parliament and bag the hell out  of them.

MARLES: Well firstly, I thank you for your comments in terms of my motives,  and I certainly hope that’s how I go about business, but I think that the  important point to understand in this and it is a really important point, we in the  Opposition want to see a resolution to boats coming from Indonesia and Sri  Lanka to Australia, we want to see that because we want to see an end to  people dying at sea, it is in everyone’s interest, and it’s in Labor’s interest if  people want to look at it at that narrow point of view, to see that this is an issue  which is resolved and that’s what we want, that’s a very different political  dynamic to the one that existed before the election.

PARTON: Yes it is.

MARLES: When the Government as we were, trying to do everything we could  to reduce the flow of boats and you had Scott Morrison do everything he could  to prevent the arrangement that we were seeking to put in place with Malaysia,  which you know would have had the potential of reducing the flow of boats and  saving lives at sea a lot earlier than what we’ve ultimately seen, that is a very  different circumstance to what we’ve got now and I think it’s a really important  point for people to understand for the first time in a long time, you’ve got both  sides of politics actually wanting to see an end to this and I think that’s a large  part of why that is occurring, so when I go to PNG I do want to know that the  arrangement that we initiated is actually working, and we’ve got a lot of skin in  the game with that arrangement.

PARTON: Alright we’ve got a bit of theatre coming up on the hill this week  because of course the carbon tax and the mining tax, the Government are going  to go through the motions of trying to force this through the Senate knowing full  well that there’s no possible chance it’s going to get through.

MARLES: Yes I think that’s right, and the position that Labor has stated in  relation to those matters is clear, we have the theatre if you like, I think that’s a  good word, of the Government today describing this as their red tape day, I  make your listeners aware that when we were in Government we removed  something like 12,000 pieces of regulation and we were very keen to remove red  tape, but one of the issues which goes to that specific debate which is important  to understand, there are occasions where one person’s red tape is another  person’s safeguard, and what we are seeing today for example is the removal of  the protection for consumers in relation to financial advisers, that Arthur  Sinodinos is seeking to put in place, which will remove the obligation for financial  planners to act in the best interest of their client. That means people will be able  to take commissions and push products without having to disclose how they are  earning their money and mums and dads, people approaching retirement who  need to have confidence that the advice that they’re getting is fair and  independent, and that is part of the measures which is being put through today,  and I think that is of enormous concern.

PARTON: Richard before I let you go, mate, is there any chance you can help  us out with our Ronald McDonald House Canberra radio-thon?

MARLES: I absolutely will and I’ve let your producer know and I think as soon  as I finish talking with you I’m being put through to your front desk and it will be  a great thing for me to make a donation and good luck today.

PARTON: You’re a good man hang on a second and I’ll pop you through to  Geoff, Richard Marles from the Federal Opposition of course, Immigration  spokesperson these days.
