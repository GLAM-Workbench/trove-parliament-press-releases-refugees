VIETNAMESE ABOARD THE TUNG AN

-  -  Australia remains firm in its position on persons on

the Tung A n , currently in Philippine waters, the Minister for "

Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, the Hon. M.J.R. MacKellar, MP,

said today.

Mr MacKellar was commenting on a nevs report from Manila

stating that Australia had agreed to take some 200 people

from that vessel.

Australia sympathises with the burdens placed on

countries such as the Philippines providing first asylum for

refugees.  Some thousands of genuine refugees have been .  : :

received by that country over ther past few years-. Mr MacKeliar -

said that-AuBhralia”irad in December agreed that' this financial

year it would accept 200 persons from, refugee camps in the .

Philippines. .  This group would definitely not include any

of the persons on the Tung A n .

-  :  Aus-tralia has clear evidence that the Tung An is one

of several large vessels carrying people whose departure had

been officially supported -by Vietnamese authorities. As .

with the other vessels it is being claimed that the people .  v:

involved should receive the same level of international

acceptance as refugees who have genuinely escaped from Vietnam.

Mr MacKellar said it was most regrettable that the

unscrupulous organisers of this type of movement were continuing

their operations. He said that it would be most unfortunate

if such stratagems were to damage properly established programmes

for the resettlement of the 200,000 refugees in camps in South

East Asia.
