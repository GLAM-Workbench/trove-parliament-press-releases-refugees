URGENT ACTION NEEDED ON MENTAL HEALTH

AMA President, Dr Bill Glasson, today released the AMA’s submission to the Senate Select  Committee on Mental Health, saying that serious action is needed on funding, medical workforce  training and policy ideas, to ready Australia for the growing challenges of mental health in the  community.

Dr Glasson said demands for significant injections of new funding for specific specialised mental  health programs and the intensive training of a highly motivated psychiatrist workforce are at the  heart of the submission.

“Only a small percentage of people affected by mental illness seek help, mostly from their GP,”  Dr Glasson said.

“The current shortage of both GPs and psychiatrists means people with mental health problems  will find it difficult to find help when they need it.

“Mental health is one of the weakest links in the Australian health care system at a time when it  needs  to be one of the strongest.

“Mental health problems are on the rise with one in five Australians aged over 18 currently  meeting the criteria of suffering from some form of mental illness.

“Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, children and adolescents, and people living in  remote and rural areas are missing out on mental health services.

W “We should retain the concept of the National Mental Health Strategy but improve it and update it.

“The mental health sector needs morc acute care beds, transition beds, step down beds, respite  accommodation, supported housing and better rehabilitation services.

“And doctors and nurses must have overall management and leadership of all mental health  services,” Dr Glasson said.

The submission notes that mental health disorders are rising in Australia.

By 2013, over 100,000 people will be affected by bipolar disorder, an increase of 6 per cent.  By 201 1, we’ll see a 10 per cent rise to 41,000 in the number of people with schizophrenia.  Dementia and depression are major issues for Australia’s ageing population  By 2050, around 730,000 Australians will be affected by dementia.

The hll submission is available on the AMA website at www.ama.com.au.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  Mental health and indigenous health are the two weakest links in the Australian health care  system. Both areas suffer from under-funding and under-manning. The health outcomes in  both areas are very poor. There is ample scope for Australia to lift its game.

In this summary of the AMA’s position, we identify the top seven problems affecting mental  health delivery and the top eight opportunities to “get it right”.

Mental health services get low funding priority: In Australia, the provision of mental  health services receives an inappropriately low priority having regard to the large  number of people affected, the high burden of disability, the untoward impact on  service-deprived sub-groups within the community and the missed potential for the  cost-effective achievement of better health outcomes. International comparisons of

mental health spending are dated (circa 1993) but suggest a spending shortfall in  Australia compared to Canada, the US and the Netherlands.

Workforce shortages in mental health are increasingly apparent and are producing  sub optimal outcomes for patients. Current and prospective workforce shortages must  be addressed concurrently with funding issues.

Policy directions were not all appropriate. The National Mental Health Strategy was  a worthwhile initiative but it is now becoming clear that some of the directions set early  in the piece were quite inappropriate. The AMA applauds the steps that have been  taken to improve policy directions and urges more. The main challenge now is to  address the failures in the implementation of the policy. A decade or so after the de-  institutionalisation of mental health, it is now obvious that governments did not ensure  enough resources for the new community-based care structures to operate effectively.

Access and equity has not yet been achieved for sub-groups within the community  with special needs or facing barriers to access: A key failure of policy is the failure to  address access and equity issues for people living in rural and remote areas,  Aboriginal peoples and Torres Strait Islanders, children and adolescents;

Stigma and discrimination remain as major obstacles to improving outcomes for  those who suffer from mental health conditions.

Existing resources are not being used as well as they could or should:  Governments decry and undervalue the large contribution of the private psychiatric  sector. The separation of some services results in significant inefficiency eg between  mental health, drug and alcohol services, and there is scope to improve patient  outcomes by integrating these services. Existing funding mechanisms favour defined  episodes of care. However the mental health conditions that generate the highest

burden of disease are chronic conditions and they require longitudinal care. The  Commonwealth/State funding arrangements are dysfunctional, funds are wasted in  duplication of administration and policy formulation while a silo mentality detracts from  the continuum of care.

Access to hospital services is increasingly problematical for public mental health  patients. The AMA does not believe that there is consistency between the National  Mental Health Strategy and the resources applied to mental health in the public  hospital sector.

The “top eight” opportunities to “get it right”

o An appreciation of the need for new money is critically important. There is a joint  obligation on governments and private providers to ensure that existing funds are spent  smarter to improve outcomes for patients. Even so, a cost-neutral constraint is a

recipe for continuing failure. There is no more fundamental starting point than ensuring  that mental health gets appropriate priority.

Funding and workforce initiatives belong together. Steps to secure an appropriate  workforce will reduce the risk of new funding being ineffective;

A proper analysis of need is an essential foundation for policy. Governments  issue lengthy reports giving the data on past spending and service provision but the  analysis of demand and unmet need is very seriously lacking. Existing and new  spending will be more effective if there is rigorous analysis of the main shortfalls in  service provision and involvement of clinicians in that analysis. Mental health spending  priorities can be much better informed than they are now. Understanding and meeting  the needs of special interest groups is a large part of this task.

We must address the dysfunction. There are recipes to address each element of  dysfunction in the mental health financing and delivery systems. We know what has to  be done. Governments are running out of excuses. The claim that we cannot afford to  take the necessary steps is bogus. Australia cannot afford not to take the necessary  steps. This submission contains many practical recommendations on steps that can be  taken to reduce or eliminate the dysfunction that is now apparent as a result of the  failures of policy and implementation including the inappropriate focus on episodic  care, the FederaVState imbroglio, the barriers between services which impair the  continuum of care, the over-specialisation of services and so forth.

We must build on the strengths of the current system. It is important to understand  what is not working but it is just as important to understand what is now working.  Australia's system of primary care has been one of the strengths of the system.  Equipping GPs and supporting their efforts to deal more effectively with mental health

problems ought to be a priority. The Better Outcomes in Mental Health is a  successful initiative, the rationing of funds notwithstanding. This program now  deserves to be expanded and has potential to be further improved. The data collection  in the private sector is another success story, one which should be emulated in the  public sector.

The Government must ensure there is a well trained and highly motivated  psychiatrist workforce and needs to address such issues as unfilled Registrar  training positions, unattractive working environments, poor remuneration etc.  Psychiatrists are among the poorest paid of all medical specialties and it is not  attracting sufficient new entrants which will show up in serious workforce shortages in  later years.

The ongoing neglect of mental health prevention must cease. There is just as  much potential to improve patient outcomes through health prevention, early  intervention and population health initiatives in the area of mental health care as there  is in other areas of health care. The realignment of priorities in favour of mental health  services should not neglect those activities nor should it absorb funding needed to  provide ongoing mental health care services.

Governments need to more effectively engage the Australian community in regard to  mental health care by: specifying what patients can expect in terms of access to  services and health outcomes (noting that potential health outcomes will differ  depending upon the condition); and being properly accountable for the way that public  funds are spent and the patient outcomes that are achieved or not achieved as a result.

1 INTRODUCTION

The Australian Medical Association (AMA) is pleased to have the opportunity to make this  submission to the Senate Select Committee on Mental Health.

On any comparison with similar first world countries, Australia has an excellent health  system. Health outcomes compare very favourably. Most Australians have access to high  quality health services and a large number of services are delivered for a relatively modest  total cost to the community. Our health professionals are well trained and health facilities  are, for the most part, high quality.

We are doing well but we could be doing better. Our health system does have some material  failings. In the judgment of the AMA, the two weakest links in the Australian health care  system are mental health and Indigenous health. Both areas suffer from under-funding  and under-manning and the health outcomes that are achieved fall well short of those that  could be achieved and well short of the outcomes that the people should expect.

There is ample scope for Australia to lift its game in mental health.

1.1 Responding to the terms of reference

The terms of reference identify sixteen particular issues for the inquiry to examine. Some of  these are first order issues while others are lower order issues. In responding to the terms of  reference, the AMA has focussed on what it sees as the first order issues and has  concentrated its effort in areas where the medical profession is best able to contribute

expertise and experience. Brief comments are offered on the remaining terms of reference.

2 MENTAL HEALTH OVERVIEW

2.1 Defining mental health

It is important in any inquiry of this nature to properly stake out the ground, to understand the  full range and importance of the conditions that come within the broad mantle of “mental  health”.

The following table lists the main categories of mental health diseases as per the World  Health Organisation’s International Classification of Diseases (ICD) system, the latest  iteration of which is known as ICD-10. The ICD is the best-known and most widely used  disease classification system.

Table 1 : Mental and Behavioural Disorders as per ICD-10

Organic disorders The best knownhost recognised of these is dementia, with Alzheimer’s  Disease having a high prevalence among the various types of dementia.

In some other disease classification systems, dementia is classed as a nervous system  disorder rather than a mental illness. That said, the aetiology of many mental illnesses is not  well understood.

AMA ission to the Senate Select Committee on Mental Health m b   AMA  5

There are a number of different ‘views’ by which we might seek to understand the relative  importance of these groups of diseases in the wider context and in relation to each other.  They vary in their impact in aggregate and on the lives of individual patients. The various  ‘views’ include the burden of disease, the prevalence of the conditions, the health system  costs, the impact on primary care and the utilisation of hospital services.

Depression makes a large call on primary care, psychotic illnesses have their major impact in  an acute care setting (hospital stays can be long) while the biggest impact of anxiety  disorders is the need for specialist care and pharmaceuticals. Note that, due to the high  prevalence, depression has a significant impact on the use of pharmaceuticals in aggregate.  Since the prevalence of depression is significant among older people, it also contributes to  aged care costs.

2.2 The burden of disease

Drawing upon methodology developed by the World Health Organisation, AlHW has  estimated the burden of disease in Australia. These measures assess the impact of disease  via a non-monetary measure, the DALY (disability adjusted life year) which has two  components:

LI the years of life lost (YLL) due to premature death-the mortality burden; and

the years of healthy life lost due to disability (YLD)-the morbidity burden.

AlHW published the first Australian burden of disease study in 1999. The study showed that:

The burden of mental disorders in Australia is dominated by affective disorders,  substance use disorders and anxiety disorders.

Substance use disorders are the leading cause of mental disorder for males,  accounting for 33% of their mental health DALYs. In turn, alcohol abuse accounts for  59% of male substance use disorder DALYs.

The major cause of mental disorder for women is affective disorders, accounting for  39% of women’s mental health DALYs. This is almost entirely depression (87%).

In 1996, mental illness was responsible for 13% of the burden of disease. Compared  with other broad disease categories, mental illness is not a major cause of death (less  than 1% of deaths). However, mental illness is a major cause of chronic disability.  in 1996, it was estimated to account for 27% of the burden of disability (YLD),

more than any other major disease group.

The 1999 report showed that the areas of mental health with the highest burden of disease  (YLL and YLD) were affective disorders (dominated by depression), substance abuse  disorders and anxiety disorders.

In terms of the burden of disability (the area where mental illnesses have a particularly heavy  burden), the mental health conditions with the greatest impact are depression and dementia  (see Chart 1).

2.3 Prevalence of mental health conditions

It is difficult to get consistent and contemporary measures of the prevalence of various types  of disease. One source is the National Health Survey (NHS), a household survey conducted  by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. This is a self-reporting survey. Due to the stigma  attaching to mental illness, self-reporting does not produce reliable measures of prevalence.

In addition, due to sampling errors, the NHS is not a reliable source of estimates where the  prevalence of a disease is low.

The 1999 AlHW burden of disease study included prevalence estimates for 1996 compiled  from many secondary sources. These are reproduced in Table 2.

While the estimates have the advantage of having been done at a single point in time, they  do refer back almost a decade. Also, it might be noted that not all stakeholders agreed with  the AlHW authors in their interpretation of the various studies and data sources. Other  studies undertaken in the intervening period may give a more up-to-date account. That said,  the need for more and better quality epidemiological data is widely accepted.

The following brief notes give an indication of how the ground has moved since 1996:  o The 1997 ABS Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing (SMHWB) put the prevalence of  affective disorders at 5.8% of Australian adults, substance abuse disorders at 7.7%  and anxiety disorders at 9.7%.

Mitchell, Slade and Andrews estimated 12-month prevalence of bipolar disorder at  0.5%. This extrapolates to 100,000 Australians as at 2003.

As at 2002, Access Economics estimates the prevalence of dementia at 0.8% of the  population, or 162,000. In 2005, this will reach 1% of the population and pass the  200,000 mark. These estimates cover those diagnosed. It is a well-recognised issue  with many health conditions that there is under-diagnosis.

LI

Taking into account comorbidity, it would seem that at least one in five Australians  has a mental health condition of one sort or another.

AlHW has provided more up-to-date estimates (for the year 2000-01) but at a much higher  level of aggregation (Table 4). While the later data do not provide any new insight into the  relative importance of the various mental illnesses, they do show where mental health sits in  the wider picture.

In 2000-01, mental health spending accounted for only 6.0% of national health spending.  However, in that analysis dementia is classified as a nervous system disorder'. When  dementia is included together with other mental health conditions as per the ICD-10  classification system, the total increases to 10.5% of national health spending.

Consistent with the earlier AlHW work by Mathers, Vos and Stephenson (1999).  1

A to t nate Select Committee on Mental Health

In comparing the 1993-94 and 2000-01 estimates, there is an apparent trebling in spending  on dementia in money terms (from $714m in 1993-94 to $2,209m in 2000-01). We are not  able to offer an informed view as to whether some of this increase may be explained by  better knowledge/more accurate diagnosis of dementia.

2.5 Provision of primary care services

General Practitioners (GPs) are the most accessible medical resource in the community and  are the gatekeepers to other community resources such as specialist psychiatric care and  acute care. Australians 5ee their GP on average just less than 5 times per year. GPs  provide close to 100 million consultations per annum to Australians and in any one year  approximately 82% of the population will see a GP.'

GPs play a vital role in the provision of mental health care. Data from the National Profile of  Mental Health and Well-Being study indicated that approximately 20% (1 in 5) of the  Australian population over the age of 18 years met the criteria for a mental health problem or  disorder. The data showed that only 38% of these people sought help and of those who did  seek help, approximately 75% did so in the first instance from a GP.3

There is concern from these and previously cited statistics, that there is an under-recognition  and less than optimal management of common mental illnesses at the primary care level.' A

range of factors contribute to this phenomenon. Patient factors include co-morbidity,  presentation as somatic complaint, stigma and embarrassment. GP factors may include  inadequate skills, time and resources. Other practice and business demands are immense,  and factors such as inadequate consultation time and insufficient access to specialized

mental health resources also play a part.4

GPs are valued by the community as important providers of mental health care and have an  important role in early detection of mental health disorders and disease management,  particularly of high prevalence  disorder^.^

The BEACH study has collected data from 1,000 GPs per annum since 1998. It analyses the  morbidity aspects of mental health (“psychological”) conditions using the International  Classification of Primary Care-Version 2 (ICPC2). Whereas the World Health  Organisation’s ICD-10 is a system of classifying diseases, ICPC2 is a classification system  for primary care covering symptoms, diagnostic screening/prevention, treatment

procedures/medication, test results, administration, other and diagnosis/disease.

Between April 2000 and March 2002, psychological problems were managed at a rate of  1 1.5/1 00 encounters in GP. Problems most commonly managed were mood disorders,  stress-related disorders, behavioural syndromes and disorders due to psychoactive  substances.* Overall, depression, anxiety and sleep disturbance were the most common  psychological conditions treated. GPs also often manage schizophrenia, dementia and child-  related psychological disorders.’

Of all the chronic health problems managed by GPs, depressive disorder was the second  most common, representing 7.1 o/o of all chronic problems managed. Hypertension (non  gestational) was top-ranked at 18.1% of all chronic problems managed. Furthermore, the  prevalence of major depression among patients in primary medical practice is about twice  that found in the general c~mrnunity.~

“The GP is the key to treatment for most people with mental disordersgs6. In short, GPs play a  significant role in the recognition and management of psychosocial disorders in the primary  care setting. Patients with mental health problems consume significant GP resources and  time. Moreover, there are increasing barriers to GPs providing these services in a timely and  effective manner.

While the prevalence of mental health problems in the Australian population has increased  over time, the number of mental health related GP encounters per 1000 population has fallen  slightly, and in 2003-04 stood at 522 GP encounters per 1000 population. Private psychiatric  attendances per 1000 population have declined steadily also. This would reflect the GP  workforce shortage Australia is currently experiencing, the availability of other non-medical  options for care and a shortfall in service provision.

The other concern in relation to workforce supply and distribution is that there are less  financial incentives for GPs to treat patients with mental illnesses, as they generally require  more time than patients with physical illnesses to manage.5 The GP consultation item  structure encourages shorter consultations and discourages longer consultations. The rate

of bulk billing is steadily declining, which may provide a further barrier for patients with  mental illness to access general practice. The percentage of bulk billed services has  declined from 80.6% in June 1997 to 72.4% in December 2004.

Recent steps by the Government to establish separate MBS item numbers to encourage a  greater GP contribution to the management of mental health patients, despite initial high  rates of uptake and registration, have not proved popular in practice. GPs report increased  paperwork and bureaucratic processes required to access these items.’

The Government will be introducing new MBS item numbers from 1 May 2005, which will  encourage a psychiatrist to make an initial assessment of a patient, prepare a management  plan and then refer the patient back to a GP for ongoing management. Anecdotal feedback  from psychiatrists predicts a low uptake of this initiative as the Government did not accept  the profession’s advice regarding the level of MBS fee necessary to change practice. In

addition it will require a significant change in management process to implement effectively.

2.6 Hospital separations

Mental and behavioural illnesses accounted for just over 4% of Australian hospital  separations in 2002-03. This percentage has changed very little over the last five years,  ranging from 4.13% in 2001 -02 to 4.20% in 2002-03 (Chart 2 depicts the 2002-03 data).

Part 3 addresses the problems in accessing hospital services, particularly public hospital  services. It would be a fundamental error to assume that the mental health share of hospital  services is proportional to the need for hospital services. Hospital utilisation data tell us  nothing about unmet needs.

The various illness groups within the area of mental and behavioural illnesses are by no  means uniform in the demand they generate for hospital services (see Table 5). In 2002-03,  mood (affective) disorders explained over one third of hospital separations due to mental and  behavioural illnesses and 1 5% of total hospital separations. Schizophrenia and neurotic  conditions each explained nearly 50,000 separations (one sixth of mental and behavioural

and 0.7% to 0.8% of total separations). Disorder due to psychoactive substance abuse  explained a further 44,000 separations (16% of mental and behavioural and 0.7% of total  separations). These four mental illness categories account for almost 90% of mental and  behavioural separations, approaching 3.7% of total separations.

It is important to note that these figures are based on separations where mental and  behavioural illnesses are the principal diagnosis. Secondary diagnosis of mental illness  (comorbidity) is significant so these data necessarily understate the impact of mental illness  on hospital utilisation.

2.7 International comparisons of mental health spending

There is a widely held belief that Australia underspends on mental health disorders relative to  other health spending, when compared with other similar countries.

In 2003, AIHW issued a report comparing spending on mental health disorders by four  countries-the Netherlands, the USA, Canada and Australia7. The report concluded that,

Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW 2003). 7

12.  d v

/\MA  A ate Select Committee on Mental Health 13

given the uncertainties of the data (including differences in the classification of mental  disorders, differences in institutional arrangements and differences in methods for allocating  cost by disease), there was no evidence that any of the four countries were under-spending  or over-spending on mental health disorders relative to each other.

One of the data issues is the boundary between health and welfare spending. AlHW notes,  for example, that residential care facilities for people with intellectual and developmental  disabilities might be classified as health spending in one jurisdiction and as welfare spending  in another.

Other factors which are said to mitigate against any easy comparison of spending on health  disorders include the differences in:

o

o

population demographics (the ageisex structure); and

the geographic dispersal of the population and the implications this has for the cost of  service delivery (Australia’s relatively small population base is spread over a large  geographic area).

The data in the AlHW report is up to a dozen years old:

Australia 1993-94

Canada 1993

Netherlands 1994

USA 1996

The Australian data suggests that spending on dementia had tripled in money (not real)  terms between 1993-94 and 2000-01. We cannot assess whether there was a similar surge  in the comparator countries.

In short, we have no contemporary and consistent international comparison to draw upon.  The bits and pieces of information we have been able to track down would suggest that  Australia’s spending on mental health is at the low end of the range. For example, in a major  audit of the NHS under the Labour Government, the King’s Fund has noted that England

allocated over 13% of its total health budget to mental health in (2004). This is certainly  higher than Australia and higher than most European countries.

Chart 3 summarises the data in the AlHW study. Note that the raw data for the Netherlands  puts spending on mental health at 15% of total expenditure on diseases. AlHW adjusts that  data to remove “non-health” spending.

As Chart 3 shows, Australia was the lowest spender among the four countries compared at  the time the comparison was made albeit not by any large margin. The Netherlands is a  geographically compact country and does not face Australia’s challenges of service delivery  in remote communities. The USA health system offers less equity in access compared with

most other first world countries and would undoubtedly be spending a lot more on mental  health if all US citizens had access to services.

Of the four countries, Australian and Canada are most alike on any number of measures,  having similar:

The fact that Canada spends proportionately more on mental health does not mean that they  are spending enough. A 2002 report on mental health in Canada pointed to the high burden  of disease and the need to raise awareness of and reduce the stigma attached to mental  illness8. These same issues apply to Australia.

The AlHW report notes that:

“As there are differences in the definitions and methods used in the disease costing  processes, it is not possible to say with any confidence that these countries differ in the  proportion of health expenditure that they allocated to mental disorders.”

It goes on to conclude that:

“Given the uncertainties with this data, there is no evidence from this disease costs  information that any of these four countries are under-spending or over-spending on  mental disorders relative to each other.”

While the AMA can appreciate why the AlHW would wish to be cautious, if Australia had  been spending 11.4% of all health spending on mental disorders (as per Canada) it would  have been spending nearly 20% more. In summary, we appear to have been at the low end  of the scale in a context where the World Health Organisation has referred to wide scale  underspending on mental health.

2.8 The Crystal Ball

In responding to the terms of reference for this inquiry, we do have a concern at the back-  looking nature they imply. It is very important to look ahead, as well as looking back.

Australia’s population is ageing. This has important implications for the health system both in  terms of the overall costs of the system (costs which fall to the community, whether as  taxpayers or individuals) and the way heath services are organised and delivered.

The ageing of the population points very clearly to the need for greater efforts in dealing with  chronic illnesses and degenerative diseases. In the area of mental health, two areas which  will be very much affected by the ageing of the population are organic conditions (dementia)  and mood [affective] disorders (depression).

Although the prevalence of depression among the elderly is lower than for younger age  groups (eg adolescents), depression is still a significant problem for elderly people. Often,  depression among elderly people is associated with the overall deterioration in their health  status. The importance of holistic care cannot be over-emphasised. If we treat the arthritis  or the cardiac problems but not the depression they cause, then we are not treating the  patient appropriately.

Due to the ageing of the population and, save for any major breakthroughs in medications  and other treatments, the number of people with dementia is forecast to increase to over  730,000 by the year 2050 (2.8% of the projected population cf. 0.8% ~urrently)~. The number  of people expected to be diagnosed with dementia every year (1 75,000) is not far short of

the total number of people estimated to be suffering from dementia in 2004 (185,000). In  short, Australia is facing a dementia epidemic. A treatment breakthrough which, for  example, deferred the onset of dementia on average by 5 years is forecast to reduce  the total number of cases by 35% by the year 2020 and 50% by the year 2050. The  obvious conclusion is that investment in research which produces a breakthrough could  generate a very large return in terms of patients’ quality of life and health system costs  saved.

Bipolar disorder may not have as high a prevalence as some other mental disorders but it is  a condition with a very high burden of disease (greater than for ovarian cancer, rheumatoid  arthritis or HIV/AIDs and similar to schizophrenia and melanoma) and a high rate of suicide.  But it attracts relatively low priority, with a very modest level of health spending per patient.  The prevalence of bipolar disorder is forecast to increase by 6%, to over 100,000 people, by

201 3.”

The prevalence of schizophrenia is lower again, estimated at 37,233 people in 2001 but  forecast to increase by 10.7%, to over 41,000 people, by 201 1 . ‘ I

All told, we are seeing a rising incidence of mental health disorders in Australia and this in  turn is lifting prevalence.

In looking to the future, it is important that we not only focus on an ageing population but also  take due account of the burden of mental conditions on children and adolescents.

3 WHERE PUBLIC POLICY HAS FAILED  Mental health is a weak link in the Australian health care system but not because the  problems are too hard, nor because the financial costs of satisfactory outcomes are more  than the community can afford. Australia is a wealthy nation and we can afford to give all

members of the community access to quality health care. When we fail to do so, it is not  because the solution is beyond our means. Rather, it reflects the choices we have made as  a community.

Due to policy and systemic failures, we have not achieved all we could with the  resources that are currently available. Furthermore, mental health has not been given  appropriate priority. The stigmatisation of mentally ill people is only partly to blame. An  honest and open assessment of policy and systemic failures is a necessary prerequisite to

improving the quality of mental health care in Australia. If the failures are denied or ignored,  then it is highly likely that they will be repeated.

It does need to be said at the outset that the AMA supports the concept of the National  Mental Health Strategy. There have been some concerns with the Strategy itself but far  greater concerns with its implementation.

This part addresses six significant public policy failures that have not been corrected over  recent years. In each case, the AMA considers that solutions are feasible and affordable.

3.1 Inappropriate focus on so-called ‘serious’ mental illness

The first National Mental Health Strategy in 1992 sought to focus public mental health  services onto people who were suffering from so-called ‘serious’ mental illnesses. It seemed  a good idea to many mental health policy makers at the time and was only opposed by a  small minority of mental health professionals.

While that policy has been watered down in recent national mental health policies and plans,  there has been no overt admission that the original policy was very misguided and, as a  result, there has been no proper remedy to the problem caused by the original policy and  plan. The legacy of that policy is that most public mental health services have been  designed to cater for people with schizophrenia and paranoid psychoses. They do not cater  for very many other groups of people with mental illness at all.

Such a policy:

o

n

Solution:

ignores the importance of early detection of clinical symptoms and early intervention;

does not recognise the considerable burden to the community caused by so-called  non-serious mental illnesses, such as anxiety disorders and depression;

tends to have an acute focus dealing with episodes of severe disorder; and

does not have a holistic long term follow-up strategy.

Public mental health services should be empowered to treat all mental health  problems and mental illnesses and to become expert at long-term  management of people with such mental health problems.

3.2 Naive belief that community care would be cheaper

The deinstitutionalisation of mental health care was the right policy but the full implications  were not understood at the time the decision was made. The provision of community based

to e Select Committee on Mental Health 18

A

specialist mental health services had the potential to provide better outcomes for patients but  were not cheaper to provide than asylum care.

Our politicians have long since sold off the land that the asylums were sited upon and have  made significant capital returns to the States without regard for the ongoing and very  significant need for recurrent funds to provide mental health services in the community.

There is also a need for a significant capital injection to provide facilities spread throughout  the community to provide special mental health needs to particular populations.

One of the ways that administrators of mental health services seek to keep the cost of care  lower is to limit care to specific treatment episodes. The result of this is that care is not being  provided in a long term more holistic manner in most environments within Australia.

Solutions: Address the under-funding of mental health services both in the community  and in the institutional sector. Increase acute carekub-acute beds for mental  health by 10 to 20 per cent so that people are not discharged only partially  well for their long-suffering carers to manage as best they can. Facilitate the

phasing in of transition beds to permit appropriate new and cost-effective  modes of care and strive for an appropriate balance of acute and transition  beds.

Address the need for specialist acute care beds throughout the community for  conditions such as combined drug and alcohol problems, combined physical  illness and mental illness problems, mood disorder units, eating disorder units  and mother and baby units.

Provide step-down beds in the community to ensure an appropriate transition  from hospital to home.

Provide more respite accommodation or supervised beds so that carers may  obtain respite from time to time.

Increase the provision of supported housing in the community where people  can live within the community but also have some degree of safety and  security in the place within which they live.

Strengthen rehabilitation services in mental health, equip them to utilise  modern scientific mental illness treatment paradigms and reverse the trend of  de-professionalisation of these services.

Target public mental health services at disadvantaged Australians, including  those who are financially disadvantaged.

3.3 Failure of generic management paradigms

Generic management paradigms have failed abysmally. Whilst a large part of the increased  cost of mental health services has been related to the increase in administrative officers,  there has been a concurrent decrease in cost effectiveness of service delivery because  these managers do not have a proper understanding of clinical management issues. It is

now becoming difficult to attract doctors and nurses into training positions in public mental  health facilities partly because of the management structures used in mental health services.

Solution: Reconsider the management paradigms within mental health. Doctors and  nurses should, in a coordinated way, have overall management leadership of

AX.  "' AMA AMA Submission to the Senate Select Committee on Mental Health 19 all mental health services and the management administrators should be at the service of those clinical directors. It will be difficult to attract doctors and nurses into true clinical director roles unless there is sufficient funding for those clinicians to provide high-quality services to their consumers. 3.4 Failure in accountability The fourth major policy failure has been in accountability. Whilst there have been eight National mental health reports since 1994, there is still no accounting in them for the number of people that are actually seen and treated in mental health services and whether they are seen face-to-face, or merely by telephone contact. This contrasts with very specific details of the number of Australians treated and even the number of hours spent treating consumers by private psychiatrists in the private mental health sector. In 2004, the Chief Psychiatrist in Victoria released a ground-breaking reporti2 which documents the critical incidents and suicides of people treated in the mental health system in Victoria. The AMA suggests that both approaches by the two big States be incorporated as part of a basic requirement for accountability by mental health services. A similar report has been issued in NSW13. While the private mental health sector has been collecting outcome measures of consumers treated in private psychiatric hospitals over the last three years, the public mental health system is only just starting to approach such a project. There are also rumblings from public sector clinicians that unless there is a very significant increase in funding for such data collection, the outcome measurement process is likely to further undermine the management of consumers in the public mental health system. Solutions: Mandate reporting by State and Territory jurisdictions of the number of people treated and whether those people are treated face-to-face or by telephone. Significantly increase the resources for outcome measurement in the public mental health system. 3.5 Failure through separation of mental health The fifth major policy failure has resulted from the separation of mental health from general health services. This is a failure in the conceptualisation of mainstreaming. Whilst it seemed reasonable for mental health to be split off from the general health sector in order to preserve and quarantine funds for mental health, the consequence is that mental health services provided in general health facilities have been degraded enormously. General health services are now poorly equipped to meet the needs of patients who have comorbid physical and mental conditions. Recent research shows that mental health services provided adjacent to general health facilities are often the most cost-effective and outcome efficient method of providing mental health services. Such specialised mental health services-which have a deep knowledge of physical and mental illnesses and the interaction between the mind and body-have in the past been called consultation liaison psychiatry services. Funding to such services is almost nonexistent because neither the mental health sector nor the general health sector wants to pay for such services. Support for GPs providing mental health care in the community needs to be part of the solution also. Office of the Chief Psychiatrist (Victoria, 2004). NSW Mental Health Sentinel Events Review Committee (2003) 12 13

r p

AMA  AMA Submission to the Senate Select Committee on Mental Health 20  W V

A related issue is that some of the more highly specialised services in the community are  delivering services which lack a strong evidence base. It is not suggested that the “medical  model” is the answer in every case but it is foolish to ignore the evidence of what works and  what does not work. It may be that the pendulum has swung too far in excluding appropriate  clin ical involve men t .

Solution: Provide specific funding within the general health sector for consultation  liaison psychiatry services which are also then provided into community  general health facilities and not just general hospitals.

3.6 Failure in the Federal system

The sixth major policy failure has been the inability to deal with the dysfunction in the Federal  system. This affects many areas of the health system. It has a particularly adverse impact  on patients at the interface between the institutional and community health care sectors. In  terms of mental health, the multiplicity of programs accentuates the barriers. The worst  outcomes from this are for patients with comorbid and serious physical and mental health  conditions. In Section 7, we address the issue of substance abuse.

Governments are wasting money through unnecessary duplication of administration and  policy formulation. These funds need to be redirected to the care of patients.

The AMA restates that the concept of the mental health strategy is a good one and the  involvement of both levels of government has been essential. There have been some  mistakes made in the directions set early in the piece but at least some of these are now  being corrected through the refinement of the strategy.

The implementation of the strategy has not, however, been as pretty. We have noted that  mental health has received an inappropriately low priority, that the funds earmarked for  mental health could have been better spent and that there has not been enough  accountability by State and Territory administrations.

A key issue is that mental health patients are often poorly placed to negotiate the health care  system, with carers given the added burden of seeking to advocate on their behalf.

The dysfunction of Federal systems is one of the most obvious stumbling blocks to spending  the money more effectively on service delivery. The AMA does not believe that the solution  lies in adding a third tier, the proposed “Australian Health Commission” on top of the tiers  that already exist.

Solutions: Serious endeavours by the Commonwealth and Statenerritory governments  to place the needs of the patients ahead of their turf wars.

PUBLIC MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES

Key Points  Public mental health services in Australia are not delivering the standard of care which  the public has a right to expect.

Public mental health care services are dysfunctional because insufficient resources  have been made available. Widely based reports and complaints from consumers,  carers, paramedical health professionals and medical staff working in mental health  attest to the above.  A very serious outcome from the under-funding of public mental health services is the  destructive impact on morale and the disincentive for health professionals to train for  and work in the area.

There is not enough access to public hospital beds for mentally ill patients. This means  that such patients are “warehoused” in hospital emergency departments which is highly  inappropriate to their special needs, as well as the needs of other patients. The  shortage of acute beds misappropriates the time of private psychiatrists who currently  expend considerable time trying to arrange hospital access for patients when they need  it.

Discussion

Because the public mental health system has been run down over many years and is now  seriously dysfunctional, the expected number of young doctors entering training to ultimately  become psychiatrists is decreasing. Many psychiatric registrar training positions across the  country are not filled by trainees. We have a clear choice now-to act now to redress the

looming workforce shortages-or to wear the larger burden of disease that will attend a  shortage of psychiatrists over the next ten years.

Similarly, nurses are not being attracted to work in psychiatry because the system is  dysfunctional and because of security problems. It is a common theme across the nation  that nurses and doctors attending severely disturbed patients are being assaulted at a rate  which is causing concern and public discussion amongst these groups.

The public system has to assume an extra responsibility for some special needs groups  within the community, groups who would otherwise have difficulty accessing appropriate care  due to the particular nature of their needs or their lack of income to afford privately provided  services. As to one area, the mental health of veterans, the AMA acknowledges the  considerable efforts made by the Department of Veterans Affairs (DVA) to identify and meet  their special needs. The mental health of veterans is not further addressed in this

submission as we feel that the Committee will be able to access ample information from DVA  and the special interest groups representing veterans.

An example of the dysfunction in the system is the problem that occurs in many emergency  departments at major hospitals in Australia. There are not enough acute units to manage the  many disturbed individuals presenting to emergency rooms and there are not enough “places  of safety” (pre-acute beds). This leads to safety and security problems in emergency  departments for patients, their families and staff, inappropriate use of emergency room  facilities, inefficiency in the overall operation of emergency facilities and dissatisfaction of

staff attempting to work in such a situation.

In some country areas the problem is even worse as, for example, a GP or a country hospital  doctor may find it extremely difficult to organise an acute admission for an acutely disturbed

12L

AMA Submission to the Senate Select Committee on Mental Health 22  .av  AMA

individual into an appropriate facility. Many GPs report extreme concerns in attempting to  manage such patients due to the dysfunction in the public system.

Historically, over twenty years ago a move began to close down many of the long-term  psychiatric hospitals and to move more towards a community based mental health care  system. What was promised at that time by governments was that in parallel with the closing  down of the chronic psychiatric beds, the community facilities would be developed at an

appropriate pace. However, what has happened is that the long-term hospitals were closed  down but the community facilities were not developed at a rate which would enable provision  of services to keep pace with needs.

Many of the patients with chronic psychiatric disorders were then left more or less to fend for  themselves on the street. This has led to many of these individuals becoming involved with  the law and ending up in gaols. Gaols are not an appropriate facility to treat individuals  suffering from serious mental disorders. Whilst there has been a move to establish acute  care psychiatric beds in inpatient facilities attached to major public hospitals, once again  there has been a reduction in the number of beds available to the point that there is no

elasticity in the system. Despite what State health departments say, there is widespread  concern in the medical community that there are not enough beds in the system to  accommodate patients who require acute psychiatric admissions. This is an unacceptable  situation in a country with ample resources.

Funding and workforce issues are inextricably linked. They must be addressed as two sides  of one coin. Funding initiatives without complementary workforce measures risk wasting  money. Workforce initiatives without complementary funding measures risk wasting people.  If we do not plan complementary funding and workforce initiatives, then we are planning for

more failure.

4.3 Recommendations  The compendium of recommendations (Part 8) contains a number of recommendations  which are directly relevant to the public mental health sector. The recurrent themes are:

The need for policy makers to understand that a key ingredient in the solution to  workforce issues is to build public mental health services of high quality and high  regard so that people will want to work in them;

The urgent need for additional funding, to reflect the higher priority which should attach  to mental health, in particular to deliver more acute care beds, sub acute beds,  transition beds, step down beds, respite accommodation, supported housing and better  rehabilitation services;

ROLE OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR INCLUDING GPs

Key Points  Private mental health is a success story in mental health.

The myth of private psychiatrists treating only the worried well is simply not borne out  by the facts. Private psychiatrists and private psychiatric hospitals treat many of the  very disturbed and seriously unwell psychiatric patients in Australia. The contribution  of the private psychiatric sector needs to be properly understood and recognised in  terms of the overall functioning of the mental health delivery system.

The private system should be better incorporated into mental health service delivery  and planning.

The Better Outcomes in Mental Health initiative in general practice is one area of  relative policy success notwithstanding the excessive rationing of access to some of  the services and the limited number of GPs participating.

That initiative is not, however, sufficient to help GPs meet all the challenges they face,  particularly those thrown up by the failures in other parts of the mental health care  system. More needs to be done to support GPs.

There is an increasing requirement for closer cooperation between psychiatrists, GPs  and other treating doctors in the management of patients. Whilst the government has  moved somewhat to facilitate this, there needs to be further government policy moves  in this direction to enhance the quality of psychiatric care delivered to Australian  patients.

Discussion

In the 2002 National Mental Health Report, the Health Department estimated that private  psychiatrists in Australia are treating about 60 per cent of the patients with psychiatric  disorders. There has been an increasing tendency in Australia for psychiatrists to either  work for the public system or in private practice but not both. The considerable experience of

psychiatrists in private practice needs to be tapped in order for those experienced  psychiatrists to provide valuable input into the public system to assist psychiatrists working in  the public system. In other words, there has to be a better integration between the public  and private systems to deliver mental health care. It is in no one’s interests, particularly the  patient, to have a type of divide between the two systems. Whilst some moves in this  direction are occurring, this needs to become the uniform policy across Australia.

It is not commonly recognised that the private mental health sector in fact sees  approximately twice as many individual Australian citizens each year as are seen by the  public mental health sector. It sees those Australians for 1/3 of the cost to the community of  public mental health services across Australia, even though the public mental health services  see only half the number of Australians that are seen by the private mental health sector.

Private mental health services are also unique in providing excellent long-term follow-up  mechanisms for people with mental illnesses. Those services are not provided only to those  with private health insurance but are also provided to people without private health insurance  on a significant scale within the community. Private mental health services are not just for

rich people. The level of bulk billing by private psychiatrists is very close to the level of bulk  billing provided by GPs and may even be higher.

Private psychiatrists treat many people with chronic illnesses in the long term, recognise  when their patients are struggling financially and discount the true cost of delivering those  services so that their patients won’t be deprived of treatment.

ate Select Committee on Mental Health 24

Instead of valuing the private mental health sector and perhaps directing targeted funds to try  to increase the value that sector can provide to the Australian community, Commonwealth  mental health policy over the last ten years has tended to be hostile towards the private  mental health sector and has, at times, tried to make that sector the scapegoat for  government policy failures.

There has been a failure to adequately recognise the private mental health sector’s important  organisational strengths. That sector has formed a voluntary alliance of the key players,  including consumers and carers, hospitals, health insurance funds and private psychiatrists.  That alliance is called the Strategic Planning Group for Private Psychiatric Services

(SPGPPS) and it is recognised as a member of the National Mental Health Working  Group.

Commonwealth mental health policy in relation to private psychiatrists has produced the  unenviable result that there has in fact been a decrease in the number of services provided  by private psychiatrists in recent years, rather than any increase in order to meet the unmet  demand in the community. It is largely because of direct Commonwealth government policy  which does not encourage entry into the specialty of psychiatry. Commonwealth mental

health administrators have expressed pride in the fact that their policies have:

produced a decrease in the cost of the Commonwealth medical benefits in mental  health; and

u led to a decrease in some services.

This seems incredible when there is an increasing burden of mental illness in the community.

One area of relative policy success has been the Better Outcomes in Mental Health  (BOiMH) initiative funded by the Commonwealth government over the past four years. This  strategy is designed as a suite of evidence-based quality initiatives aimed at assisting GPs to  improve their identification and management of persons with high prevalence mental  illnesses. As well as education designed to improve the assessment, management plan  development and review processes, there are incentive payments and specific item numbers  for undertaking evidence-based focused psychological strategies (FPS) for those GPs who  fulfill certain minimum criteria. The initiative also aims to increase GP access to urgent  advice from psychiatrists and management support from allied health professionals.

Significant weaknesses of that policy are apparent.

Despite the apparent high registration rate of GPs with the HIC for the service incentive  payments, (SIPS) the claim rate for that pool of money is vastly under-spent. Anecdotally,  this is due to a combination of factors from the GP perspective including bureaucratic red  tape processes and the fact that a wide variety of conditions are included in the ‘mental  health’ item number, which stigmatises a patient with a mental illness.

Bureaucratic processes also inhibit utilization of these processes, particularly regarding the  fact that only GPs who work in accredited practices can register for the initiative-this  excluded many Aboriginal Medical Services and Youth-specific services, just as examples.

Access to ‘Level 2’ training for participation in the FPS is difficult, with only a limited number  of (minimum 20 hour) programs certified by the Standards Collaboration. Most of these  training programs are held in metropolitan or large regional centres which make access  difficult for doctors in rural and remote locations.

The lack of proper integration of that initiative with private practice psychiatry is a matter of  concern and of direct relevance to the Senate inquiry. As mentioned previously, a new

M

Medicare item number for GPs to refer for assessment and development of a management  plan will be implemented from May. The AMA is concerned that the Government’s moves  are not sufficiently bold to provide the necessary encouragement for either the psychiatrists  to asses and refer back, or the GP to undertake ongoing management of these patients.

A popular component of BOiMH has been the access to allied health. Psychological and  counselling services that are financially accessible to persons with mental illness are  extremely restricted throughout Australia. These BOiMH projects are Division of General  Practice based, although not all Divisions run these services. This counselling component is  subject to capped funding and GPs are very limited in the numbers of services that they may  refer patients to, some Divisions reporting that they can only refer 5 patients per annum.

Unfortunately the Government has not released the full evaluation report for this program.  This is of grave concern, when even the members of the Better Outcome Implementation  Advisory Group are not privy to the details of the evaluation. The initiative has, however,  been funded to continue and expand its scope for another four years.

Finally, there is little evidence that increased psychological training of GPs actually improves  outcomes for persons with mental illnesses. At best, it appears to improve GPs’ confidence,  detection and possibly management effectiveness4 As a result, the BOiMH initiative has not  been able to achieve the full measure of success that could have been achieved.

Despite the positive aspects, the BOiMH initiative is not a panacea that can solve all the  challenges that GPs face in the area of mental health. GPs tell us that they are being left to  look after people that no one else is able to manage due to resource constraints. They note  that the financially disadvantaged in the community suffering from mental illness are still not  being looked after adequately by the public mental health services. Some of those people  are being managed by the private mental health sector but that sector is limited because of  policies that have caused it to contract. GPs are being asked to pick up the pieces when  other services fail to meet the needs. GPs report a continued lack of collaboration with, and  support from, specialist mental health care  service^.^

GPs say they desperately need services in the community that can provide long-term follow-  up to those people with mental illness, particularly those that are disadvantaged socio-  economically or in other important ways. The general practice sector is not able to manage  all those people without support and require further assistance from private psychiatrists and  public mental health services.

GPs are in the front line of service provision and more than 70% of mental health illness care  is provided by General Practitioners so it is important that we get it right and that referral to  fully trained Psychiatrists is available as a back up for GPs where there are difficult cases.

5.3 Recommendations  The compendium of recommendations (Part 8) contains a number of recommendations  which are directly relevant to the public mental health sector. The recurrent themes are:

o The BOiMH program shows promise and very good arguments can be made for  building it up and further improving it.

The Federal and State Governments need to acknowledge the key role of private  Psychiatrists and General Practitioners in the provision of services to the mentally ill  and work with the relevant representatives to encourage the provision of those services  to Australians.

LI An intensive and ongoing re-education program be provided to Commonwealth and  State mental health administrations in order to assist them in being able to recognise  the benefits of a collaborative approach with the private mental health sector.

Innovative funding should be provided for key targeted strategies in the private mental  health sector. Such strategies may include early intervention and prevention  approaches in conjunction with general practice. They may also include statistical  collection and outcome measurement in private psychiatry off ice-based practice and  targeted funding for psychiatric nurses and psychologists to be able to work under

supervision of private psychiatrists in private psychiatric practices, linked closely t o  the  current referral system from GPs to private psychiatrists. This will facilitate the  provision of integrated community treatment in the longer term to people who have  long-lasting mental illnesses.

The need to address the considerable disincentives for workforce participation in all  arenas including: the dysfunction in the management of public health institutions and  the poor working conditions which deter younger doctors from seeking a career in  mental health care; the low rates of pay compared with other medical specialties; the  inappropriate rebates and remuneration structures which discourage GPS from  providing high quality longitudinal care and the inappropriately low rebates for  psychiatric services.

6 ACCOUNTABILITY Terms of reference (a) and (0)

6.1 Key Points  a The greatest failure in accounting for the outcomes of the mental health strategy is the  failure to assess needs. This is utterly basic to the whole analysis. Without a needs  assessment, it is impossible to rate progress in achieving the aims of the strategy.

There should be much more open accountability for the actual spending of mental  health allocated funds from Federal and State Government sources, looking at the  actual application of these funds to the delivery of mental health services. We are  continually informed that allocated funds may not reliably end up in mental health  services but may end up in some other part of the health system.

o

6.2 Discussion

The National Mental Health Report for 2004 (the 8th report in the series) comprises 120  pages of detailed reporting of expenditure, staffing and utilisation measures (eg, private  psychiatric services, inpatient bed days). It is typical of so many reports from the health  bureaucracy in that it limits its focus to the formal health delivery system-the costs of that  system and the outputs from it-and ignores all the indirect costs of disease, the burdens on  families and carers and so forth. It is, at best, a very partial assessment of the matters which  ought to be taken into account in the assessment of any health strategy.

The report states, very lamely, that:

“It is not known how much spending on mental health services is required to meet the  priority needs of the Australian population. However, surveys conducted of the extent  of mental illness in the community have highlighted a high level of unmet need. Similar  findings have been reported in other countries.”

Later it concedes that:

“Finally, changes in the resourcing of mental health services need to be considered in  the light of the findings from the National Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing and  increasing international evidence that highlight the substantial level of unmet need for  mental health care. An implication is that current funding levels in all states and  territories may not be enough to meet priority community needs.”

These two quotes from the report contain the only references in it to unmet need. How then  can we assess progress in achieving the aims of the National Mental Health Strategy? The  third and current version of the strategy declares:

“The framework also stresses the importance of monitoring mental health and mental  illness within populations - both at single points in time and longitudinally - in order to  describe the epidemiology of given mental illnesses and to provide information to  match the level and type of interventions to population needs.”

If we don’t know what the needs are, how can we match interventions to needs? A proper  needs assessment is essential if governments are to comply with the first principle of the  National Health Strategy.

“All people in need of mental health care should have access to timely and effective  services, irrespective of where they live.”

As addressed in Part 3.4: there has been a major failure in accountability in relation to the  mental health strategy. There is no accounting in the reports for the number of people that

are actually seen and treated in mental health services and whether they are seen face-to-  face,  or merely by telephone contact. We reported in that Part that the Chief Psychiatrist for  Victoria has documented the critical incidents and suicides of people treated in the mental

7 OTHER ISSUES

7.1 Substance abuse Term of reference (a)

Substance abuse is having a significant and increasing impact on morbidity and mortality of  Australia's younger generations. Alcohol related problems are also significant, particularly  for younger females.

Individuals with substance related problems increasingly present to doctors or emergency  departments with what initially appear to be psychiatric symptoms.

These trends present significant challenges for the National Mental Health Strategy. While  the strategy itself presents mental health issues in terms of motherhood statements, there is  a clear and ever present need for reassessment of the nature and extent of the problems so  that resources can be directed to the areas of greatest need.

There has for many years been a distinction between alcohol and drug related services and  psychiatric services in Australia and New Zealand. The separation of drug and mental health  services produces poor outcomes for patients. We note that:

o 80% of mental health patients smoke. Nicotine withdrawal is a significant problem  aggravating acute admissions for psychosis. These issues are often not recognised  and not addressed;

More than 50% of detained patients have problems of Alcohol and other drugs (AOD)  abuse and or dependence. These are poorly treated and the two systems lead to  patients going from pillar to post;

Advanced training for Fellowship of the Australasian Chapter of Addictive Medicine  (FAChAM) has no or very few training posts in medicine and none in psychiatry;

Patients with mental health and AOD comorbidities fall between the cracks are badly  treated and relapse. Suicide, marriage breakdown and prison are not at all uncommon  consequences for these people with psychosis and AOD problems.

o

Because of comorbidity problems there needs to be a national policy to integrate services for  psychiatry in general, substance related problems and general medicine.

There are many policy problems with the National Drug Strategy. It has been dominated by  the public health approach and psychology. There is room to improve the clinical  management of people with AOD by GPs, general physicians and surgeons or in teaching  hospitals as evidenced by the following:

it is estimated that 15% of admissions to a general and teaching hospital are a direct  consequence of AOD problems;

in another 20% of admissions AOD problems are a secondary finding;

alcohol consumption is implicated in many types of cancer;

smoking cessation programs are absent from hospitals;

there are no AOD services in most teaching hospitals in Australia. This results in poor  training of students and young doctors, who do not see anyone addressing these  problems as a part of what should be basic care;

83% of all patients see GPs each year; 5% of these patients have alcohol dependence;  10% of these patients have other AOD problems. GPs don't intervene because there  is no policy that supports doctors to intervene. For example the Asthma 1,2,3 Special  Incentive Payment should be there also for alcohol; and

Ai.

AMA Submission to the Senate Select Committee on Mental Health 30  .PI  R M A

o home detox for alcohol should have a SIP payment.

Much of the AOD clinical funding has gone to NGOs. Whilst those AA based supportive  services are important, there is a range of excellent, evidence based clinical interventions  that GPs and physicians and psychiatrists can undertake including: good brief intervention;  care planning; home detox; acamprosate; naltrexone; smoking cessation; methadone

maintenance; and, buprenorphine maintenance. Separation of AOD services and psychiatry  occurs only in Australia and New Zealand. It is an accident of history.

Placing individuals with serious mental health problems in gaols under the legal system is not  an acceptable way to manage such problems. This has led to a large increase in gaol  populations of people with psychiatric disorders. The forensic psychiatric services in the  gaols simply cannot cope with the extent of this problem.

What can be done to improve outcomes? Following are some practical suggestions:  0

0

0 0

7.2

Appropriate care for people with psychiatric disorders in a place of safety (not gaol)  where they can receive appropriate treatment;

The provision of AOD services by teaching hospitals should be a requirement for their  accreditation and the Australian Council of Health Care Standards should be asked to  develop the criteria. Accreditation should be only provisional and for 12 months if they  are found wanting. This would be the case in all except one SA teaching hospital,

many in WA, NT, and Victoria;

Bringing together MH and AOD and making them both a part of the National chronic  disease strategy and initiatives; and

Most people with chronic health problems and psychiatric comorbidity are also very  poorly served by current mental health policies. CL psychiatry which picks up much of  the overt AOD problems in hospitals also recognises a great lack of care for many  patients with depression, anxiety, somatisation disorder, chronic pain, chronic fatigue  states, COPD, heart disease and diabetes etc.

Co-ordination through an episode of care Term of reference (c)

We have a problem with the concept of episode of care in relation to many people suffering  from mental illness. The nature of many mental illnesses is that they can be ongoing or  chronic and may be associated as well with chronic physical illnesses. An episodic model of  care is therefore intrinsically most inadequate. Concepts associated with ongoing tracking of  people with chronic illness, as described in chronic physical illness strategies, are often much  more appropriate for consideration with people who suffer from ongoing mental illnesses.

Better integration of the treatment provided to people who suffer from chronic co-morbid  physical and mental illness would be of great benefit.

7.3 Accommodation, employment, social support Term of reference (e)

There is no doubt that for full and adequate recovery from mental illnesses it is important that  the areas of accommodation, employment and social support are addressed adequately. It  has been the experience of people with mental illness that the services in these areas are  even less well provided for people with mental illness than are treatment services.

There is an urgent need for the provision of much greater supported accommodation options  with professional and other supervision. Likewise, there is an unmet need for employment  training and adjustment options as well as the provision of places in employment situations  for people that may not be able to work to full capacity. Social support services are

A;&

AMA ission to the Senate Select Committee on Mental Health 31 dr  AMA

sometimes provided by non-government organisations but the full range of options for people  with different types of mental illnesses has not really been provided in our communities.

7.4 Special needs of Indigenous Australians Term of reference (f)

The healthcare available to Australia’s Aboriginal peoples and Torres Strait islanders is  completely inadequate having regard to their health status. This undoubtedly contributes to  the poorer health outcomes they experience.

This also applies in the mental health area where there is ample evidence of Indigenous  people being seriously affected by:

o

o

n social and cultural dislocation;  o child abuse; and

o serious comorbidity issues.

disproportionately high rates of suicide;  disproportionately high rates in gaol contributing to mental health problems;

substance abuse (alcohol, drugs, petrol sniffing);

A number of initiatives for the mental health of Aboriginal and Torres Strait communities will  be more effective if a culturally empowering approach is pursued, including actions to  improve the community spirit and confidence in those communities.

That said, there are a number of mental illnesses that can strike in any community and occur  at a similar incidence in most communities and which require specialised mental health  interventions. It is important that such illnesses can be readily identified and quickly and that  adequate culturally sensitive mental health specialist resources can be applied to assist  those people comprehensively.

On the evidence available to us, such mental health resources are not readily available to  many Aboriginal and Torres Strait communities.

7.5 Special needs of children Term of reference (f)

The AMA agrees with the Australian Infant, Child, Adolescent and Family Mental Health  Association (AICAFMHA) that the Australian Government should convene a National Mental  Health Summit on Infant, Child, Adolescent and Family Mental Health including key  stakeholders in order to develop a dedicated Infant Child and Adolescent Mental Health Plan  to complement the National Mental Health Plan 2003-2008.

The AICAFMHA position paper cites recent evidence compiled by the World Health  Organization (WHO) which indicates that by the year 2020, childhood neuropsychiatric  disorders will rise by over 50 percent internationally to become one of the five most common  causes of morbidity, mortality, and disability among children.

In Australia surveys indicate that between 14 - 18% of children and young people aged 4-1 6  years experience mental health problems of clinical significance (which equates to more than  500,000 individuals nationally). These findings are comparable with findings internationally.

It is also well-documented that young people can encounter special problems in accessing  health services that are appropriate to their needs.

‘I’

/\MA  AMA Submission to the Senate Select Committee on Mental Health 32  wr

The prevalence of mental health problems and disorders in children and young people in  Australia is significant and represents a large public health problem. This clearly requires a  greater investment in infants, children and adolescents within a developmental model which  addresses their unique needs and helps them develop the life skills which will equip them to  deal adequately with whatever life throws at them. The clear objective is to reduce the  number needing acute support services in the future.

There is a need for a structured support system for children with mental health problems  including behavioural issues such as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). There  is a need for better evidence in matters such as the effectiveness of drugs. Funding for  research in these areas should be a priority.

7.6 Special needs of older people Term of reference (f)

Older Australians frequently have multiple, chronic and complex health care problems that  impact upon not only their medical health but also their physical, psychological and social  functioning.

The quality and availability of medical care, including for mental illness, for older people at  home, in hospital and in residential aged care facilities should be compatible with the highest  standards of care. Standards of care should not be compromised through discrimination on  the basis of age, restriction of resources or economic rationalisation. Health care and social  services, including comprehensive assessment and effective rehabilitation, should be  directed towards the restoration and maintenance of each person‘s optimal level of

independence.

With the increasing proportion of older people in the population, health care services for older  people should be expanded within the community setting, in hospitals and in residential care.  The effectiveness of these services must be regularly evaluated to ensure that older peoples’  needs are being met.

Dementia is a very significant health issue confronting aged Australians and the health  system. Its prevalence is expected to rise dramatically as previously indicated. Whether it is  regarded as a mental illness or a neurodegenerative illness is not important from the point of  view of the impact on people and the health system. This is why the Government has

declared dementia an effective national health priority area. This is appropriate and will help  to keep a focus on dementia care and research.

Psychogeriatric care for both mental illness and dementia requires specialised staff and  facilities to complement geriatric services. The staff and facilities should be able to provide  appropriate assessment and management whether the older person is at home, in hospital or  in residential care. Adequate staff must be available to provide quality care.

Partnerships must be built and maintained between GPs, primary health care providers,  specialists, carers, service providers, patients and their family carers, through consultation,  regular communication, and education. Collaborative, multidisciplinary approaches to  treatment and care work best in terms of both patient and social outcomes.

7.7 Special needs of Australians in rural areas Term of reference (f)

There are some clear differences in the availability and delivery of services to people with  mental health conditions in rural areas. There are also different patterns of mental illness in  rural Australia. For example, there is an increased risk of suicide particularly for young  males compared to their metropolitan counterparts. This is coupled with poor access to  psychiatrists and General Practitioners for the treatment of mental illness. Although there

Ask

AMA Submission to the Senate Select Committee on Mental Health 33  WtV  AMA

has been much effort expended on attracting medical practitioners to rural settings, it is still  the case that the doctor/population ratios are much worse for rural Australia which  exacerbates the greater underlying reluctance of many rural Australians to seek medical care  particularly in relation to mental illness.

There is even poorer access to Non Government services such as Church based counselling  services and private sector psychologists and therapists.

From the medical practitioner’s point of view, there are fewer options for care available for  patients presenting to a GP surgery with sometimes severe mental illness. Also, there is a  reduced capacity in small hospital emergency departments to deal with psychiatric  emergencies. Medical Practitioners have much more difficulty in finding inpatient beds and  there is greater difficulty in transporting psychiatric patients to a bed in another rural  environment or in a metropolitan area.

7.8 Support of Primary Carers Term of reference (9)

The Government and the health professions are duty bound to seize all the opportunities for  cost-effective ways to achieve better quality health outcomes for patients. The evidence  suggests that health outcomes will be enhanced where the primary carers of those suffering  from mental illness receive support, education and training as well as being involved in the

overall treatment management of their loved ones.

Strategies to involve primary carers in the overall treatment management of their loved ones  are subject to one important qualification. The patient must consent to it. Patients should be  encouraged to involve their primary carers in their overall treatment planning in some way  but this should never be coerced.

7.9 Reducing latrogenesis Term of reference (i)

Our organisation was puzzled by the use of the term “iatrogenesis” in the context of mental  health. The main cause of continuing suffering in the mental health area is the lack of  adequate access to adequate and professional mental health services. Therefore, the main  cause of suffering in mental illness is not due to doctor produced illness but to a lack of

medical management of their mental health conditions.

We believe that the use of this term “iatrogenesis” in the Terms of Reference indicates a  carryover of stigma, into the formulation of ideas for this Inquiry. It is a common stigma that  mental illness can be treated by almost anyone because it is just commonsense dressed up;  and so, does not require doctors for treatment provision. Conversely, a stigmatised view

holds that doctors involved in mental health care are causing much of the disturbance in their  patients.

The people that provide services to those with mental illness are often stigmatised alongside  of those people suffering from mental illness. To some extent, psychiatrists in particular, are  willing to wear that stigma, because they therefore share in the stigma that their patients  suffer from. Psychiatrists are then able to work together with their patients in a genuine way,  to try to decrease such stigma within the community.

We would like to highlight the fact that rather than iatrogenesis being a major systemic  problem in relation to mental illness, the most serious systemic problem causing people to  NOT obtain adequate treatment for mental illness, is actually stigma within the Australian  community. Stigmatised attitudes cause people to avoid approaching mental health services  for assistance and stigmatised attitudes lead people to seek help from alternative sources of

mental health care that may be far from adequate. We would note the large number of

mittee on Mental Health 34

internet sites and other counselling-type services that actually have destructive effects rather  than helpful effects for those people suffering from mental illnesses. The fact that the  community does not consider such poor information sources as a major problem for people  with mental illness, reflects either stigma, or a lack of concern about this whole area.

The final comment in this reference term concerning the need for greater consumer  participation is agreed by our organisation. The AMA has been at the forefront of the  development of innovative partnerships between consumers, consumer organisations and  our profession. We have been instrumental in assisting the formation of national consumer  participation groups in mental health.

7.10 Mental Health in Detention Term of reference (j)

Mental health is a major issue for people in detention, whether those in the prison system or  asylum seekers in immigration detention. There are important differences between these  two groups of detainees particularly in relation to how they arrive in detention ie through the  court system or through immigration processes.

There is evidence of severe and chronic post-traumatic stress disorder among asylum  seekers during and after detention, some of which may relate to the situations they faced  before seeking asylum in Australia as well as the experience of detention itself.

The system of detention for asylum seekers has a particularly corrosive impact on children  held in detention. The AMA calls for the release of all children held in immigration detention.  The Australian Government has a duty of care to all asylum seekers held in immigration  detention including a duty to give them access to independent, transparent, appropriate and  timely mental health care. Asylum seekers must also have access to translation services so  that their health care can be effective.

The relocation of immigration detention centres much closer to major population centres and  capital cities in particular, would make it much easier to provide adequate mental health  service resources and also interpreting resources for providing adequate investigation of  both physical and mental health needs of these people. There is a requirement for a very

large increase in resourcing to provision of mental health and interpreting services to  immigration detainees, until the time that such detention centres can be relocated to facilities  adjacent to major population centres.

In terms of prison detainees there is overwhelming evidence of the poor state of mental  health of those people detained under the criminal justice system and, more recently, in the  immigration detention system. Such evidence for poor mental health has been available for  many years and through a number of scientific studies. The recent case of Cornelia Rau has  drawn the public's attention to the problems in identifying and adequately managing cases of

mental illness, including pre-existing mental illness, within both the criminal justice system  and the immigration detention system. The case also raises the possibility of people with  mental illness being inappropriately detained in prison. We would certainly advocate for  better resourcing for mental health services to people in detention including better forensic  services.

The AMA calls for greater use of diversionary programmes, especially for young offenders  and first time offenders. We would also advocate for appropriate addressing of psychosocial  difficulties of young offenders and first time offenders, in order to try to prevent further  offending behaviour.

1:.

AMA Submission to the Senate Select Committee on Mental Health 35  .$. RMA  7.1 1 Detention and Seclusion Term of reference (k)

For some deeply disturbed individuals, the appropriate treatment paradigm will include a  sanctuary, or place of safety. We understand that detention and seclusion on an involuntary  basis within mental health facilities is presently complying with human rights instruments,  after a review of all jurisdictions’ detention and seclusion activities in relation to human rights  requirements. We also applaud the process of safety and quality policy, which is specifically  looking at the issues of seclusion and detention under that framework. We believe that most  facilities in Australia where people are involuntarily detained or under seclusion, do in fact  comply with international human rights requirements.

We have become aware of a problem related to the difficulties in maintaining involuntary  treatment status for people in the community. On a number of occasions, doctors have  become aware that a person who has previously suffered a mental illness is becoming ill  once again and the doctor has been approached by family members of the patient who also  are aware of the impending descent into severe mental illness that is about to occur. Both  family carers and doctors in those situations feel very powerless to be able to do anything  about the situation. That is because the person’s illness has not deteriorated to the point  where they are a danger to themselves or other people and the patient cannot be required to  undertake involuntary treatment unless there is a clear danger to life.

Nevertheless, the high probability that the patient is likely to deteriorate into that state is  clearly apparent to both doctors and family carers. Neither group of people can do anything  about that situation until there is an actual risk to life.

We wonder whether it is possible to examine this issue, with involvement from both  professional and consumer and carer groups, to see if there is any way of being able to  ensure involuntary treatment to people who have a history of significant mental illness and  threat to life in the past and who appear to be deteriorating in the eyes of both professionals  and family carers. Would it be possible to institute a legal mechanism, perhaps accessed  through magistrates’ courts, which might allow earlier involuntary detention where health

professionals, carers and an advocate for the patient are in agreement? There are issues of  judgment here. Nobody would wish to see a patient’s human rights violated in a situation of  involuntary detention. Equally, it can be argued that those rights are violated when  appropriate care is not provided.

7.12 Education and De-stigmatisation Term of reference (I)

Educational information for consumers, carers and community can always be improved with  greater resourcing. High quality information is important as part of the total process towards  de-stigmatisation. Poor quality or inaccurate or misleading information has a very negative  impact on the process of de-stigmatisation and often reinforces stigmas associated with  mental illness and its treatment. It is important when considering such educational material  to involve consumer and carer groups as well as professional groups in assessing the  information and its likely impacts.

7.13 Mental Health Research Term of reference (n)

We believe that mental health research is vital in strengthening the evidence base to mental  health services in Australia. There is a cross-fertilisation of the research community with the  practising community in our country and a strong research community is vital for that positive  cross-fertilisation to continue occurring. We would also note that this is a time of burgeoning  new knowledge in neuroscience. We would suggest that it would be prudent for Government  to invest increased resources into mental health research, because there may actually be

financial pay-offs to Australian society through mental health research that makes  breakthroughs in the understanding and treatment of mental illnesses.

There is only one note of caution regarding all types of health research. We commonly refer  to “evidence-based medicine” to mean clinical practices based on the results of research.  Evidenced-based medicine has its limitations, particularly when it is based on limited data  and used simplistically. While it is a potentially useful tool to improve the quality of treatment,  we also need to mindful of the risks when it is not done well. There are particular risks in

seeking to use evidence-based medicine as a fiscal managerial tool. Recent examples of  the problems that can arise with a simplistic use of evidence-based medicine concern the  effectiveness of antidepressant medicine and problems associated with a lack of adequate  evidence concerning the safety of use of modern antidepressant medication in young people  and adolescents. These incidences should serve as a warning.

We believe there is a need for more applied research, with research monies specifically  directed to research about the treatments that are already being applied by experienced  clinicians and the outcomes achieved. Then there can be a matching up between such  applied research and purer randomised control trial research.

7.14 New modes, e-technology Term of reference (p)

It is always worth looking towards new modes of service delivery, which might lead to greater  productivity and better outcomes. Clinicians working in the area of mental health and the  consumers with whom they interact, are working together to look at new modes of delivery  that might achieve those aims. Doctors would be willing to consider extending their ability to  provide long term treatment of mentally ill people in the community, through supervision of  other health professionals. This could include extension of the better mental health  outcomes initiative, by specific inclusion of private psychiatrists in such supervision modules  and linked to general practitioners.

E-technology has been specifically mentioned in your reference term, indicating an  expectation that electronic communications and computers may be one of the new delivery  modes of interest. Mental health has been quite active in looking at this new area and that is  interesting because mental health care by and large is not highly technological; meaning that  it does not involve many machines or non-human technologies. Australia has been a leader  in the development of telehealth or telepsychiatry and it is depressing that the area of tele-  mental health has not developed more, largely because of a lack of governmental interest,  despite the high demonstrated needs of rural and remote populations.

E-health records are often touted as a new way forward for communication between  clinicians. We think it is very important that the hype for what can be achieved with  electronic communication is not overblown. In the mental health sphere, e-health records  offer quite a number of opportunities for better communication but also provide a number of  problems in terms of privacy and confidentiality. The concerns of the sector about such  matters are not improved by frequent revelations in the media of other supposedly secure  databases being accessed by unauthorised individuals. Seemingly repeated inappropriate  access to the Victoria Police “secure” database is a disturbing case of this. Even more  disturbing has been the lethargy of politicians and police in correcting those problems. It was  even alleged that a politician accessed the database inappropriately. Little sanction has  been applied to the offenders. Consumers and doctors will remain wary of “secure” e-health  databases until our community leaders wake up to their responsibilities.

8 COMPENDIUM OF RECOMMENDATIONS

Reference (a): Relating to Effectiveness of National Mental Health Strategy

u

L I

o

Retain the concept of the National Mental Health Strategy.

Correct the glaring deficiencies in the funding of the Strategy-acknowledge that there  are both funding deficiencies and a workforce shortfall.

Focus funding initiatives to deliver more places of safety, acute care beds, transition  beds, step down beds, respite accommodation, supported housing and better  rehabilitation services.

Increase mental health’s “slice of the pie” of government funding for public health  services in a staged program consistent with progress in training more health  professionals to work in the area.

o Reconsider the management paradigms within mental health to give doctors and  nurses overall management leadership of all mental health services.

o Empower public health services to treat all mental health problems and mental  illnesses and to become expert at long-term management of people with such mental  health problems.

Undertake a proper econometric analysis of the need, including the unmet need, for  mental health services in Australia and incorporate this analysis into future National  Mental Health reports.

Mandate reporting by State and Territory jurisdictions of the number of people treated  and type of treatment provided, including whether those people are treated face-to-face  or by telephone.

Be more forward-looking in planning for future mental health requirements in the  context of an ageing Australia.

Acknowledge that a key ingredient in the solution to workforce issues is to build public  mental health services of high quality and high regard so that people will want to work  in them.

Acknowledge that mental health has suffered from the dysfunction in Commonwealth/  State health administration and find ways to ’cut through’ the inertia to streamline  administrative processes and bring a stronger focus on national mental health goals.

Reference (b): Adequacy of Modes of Care

o Take immediate action to correct the inadequacies of acute and very basic community  care services in the public sector implying, inter alia, a greater provision of services by  psychologists and counsellors.

Address the highly unsatisfactory outcomes that arise from “warehousing” mentally ill  patients in emergency departments, gaols and remand centres.

Provide specific funding within the general health sector for consultation liaison  psychiatry services which are also then provided into community general health  facilities and not just general hospitals.

o Look for effective (evidence-based) programs involving prevention and early  intervention and apply the incentives for the provision of these programs in all sectors  (public and private). Expand the capacity of community by sponsoring mental health  first aid courses.

AMA

Widen the focus of prevention and early intervention programs to maintain the integrity  of families affected by mental illness and help minimise the adverse consequences of  people suffering from mental illness on general family life.

Strengthen rehabilitation services in mental health, equip them to utilise modern  scientific mental illness treatment paradigms and reverse the trend of de-  professionalisation of these services.

Redress the great unmet need for respite care to relieve the pressures on the carers of  people suffering from mental illness.

Focus publicly provided mental health care onto populations of disadvantage, including  populations of financial disadvantage.

u

o

Reference (c): Funding Co-ordination throughout an Episode of Care  Reference (n): Mental Health Research  Reference (0): Data Collection and Outcome Measurement

These three elements of the terms of reference are addressed co-jointly because they are  inextricably interlinked.

Acknowledge that the chronic nature of many mental illnesses and, in some cases,  their associated chronic physical illnesses render completely inappropriate the concept  of an ‘episode of care’. Whether care is ongoing or episodic, the need for better co-  ordination is the same.

In addition, build programs around an understanding of the need for better integration  of treatment provided to people who suffer from chronic mental illness with particular  attention to those with co-morbid physical and mental illness.  Increase the priority given to mental health research in Australia from the now  inappropriately low priority having regard to the burden of disease. Epidemiological  studies are often based on old and hopelessly inadequate data.

Facilitate wider circulation of the clinical practice guidelines prepared by The Royal  Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists.

Explicitly fund data collection in the public sector (especially the public community  sector) to allow outcome measurement to occur (without sacrificing good clinical  practice in service units that are very hard pressed trying to meet the needs of patients  as things stand) and so that it can catch up to the private sector.

De-identify all data to combat stigmatism and discrimination.

Recognise that even the rudimentary outcome measures (at this juncture) are changing  the culture of mental health service delivery in a positive way and encourage further  development of these measures.

Tie the funding for service provision to patient services rendered, not to compliance  with national standards of data collection or outcome measurement.

Reference (d): Role of Private and Non-Government Sectors

o Acknowledge the key role of Psychiatrists and General Practitioners in private practice  in the provision of services to the mentally ill and work with the relevant representatives  to encourage the provision of those services to Australians. This will encompass  solutions to the considerable disincentives for workforce participation in all arenas

including the dysfunction in the management of public health institutions and the poor  working conditions which deter younger doctors from seeking a career in mental health  care, the low rates of pay compared with other medical specialties, the inappropriate

rebates and remuneration structures which discourage GPS from providing high quality  longitudinal care and the inappropriately low rebates for psychiatric services.

Provide an intensive and ongoing re-education program to Commonwealth and State  mental health administrations in order to assist them in being able to recognise the  benefits of a collaborative approach with the private mental health sector.

Provide innovative funding for key targeted strategies in the private mental health  sector to facilitate the provision of integrated community treatment in the longer term to  people who have long-lasting mental illnesses. Such strategies may include:  o early intervention and prevention approaches in conjunction with general practice;  o statistical collection and outcome measurement in private psychiatry office-based

practice; and  o targeted funding for psychiatric nurses and psychologists to be able to work under  supervision of private psychiatrists in private psychiatric practices, linked closely to  the current referral system from GPs to private psychiatrists.

Non-government providers of rehabilitation services should be involved in appropriately  clinically determined and monitored management plans for selected patients, with the  same levels of accountability as government providers of rehabilitation services.

Reference (e): Accommodation, Employment and Social Support

Acknowledge that full and adequate recovery from mental illnesses requires proper  attention to the areas of accommodation, employment and social support.

Work with State and Territory administrations to meet the urgent need for the provision  of much greater supported accommodation options.

Supplement that where required with support from professional and other supervision  for employment training and adjustment options.

Encourage the provision of places in employment situations for people that may not be  able to work to full capacity.

Provide a wider range of social support services for people with different types of  mental illnesses to support those provided by non-government organisations.

Reference (f): Special Needs Groups

The lame efforts to assess the need for mental health care means a lack of clarity around the  adequacy of services provided to many special needs groups. There is much that can, and  should, be done.

Aboriginal Peoples and Torres Strait Islanders:

o recognise that Indigenous Australians experience much worse general health and  mental health outcomes than other Australians, accept the need for more generous  funding and ensure that it is delivered in a way that is culturally appropriate and  empowers communities.

Infant, child, adolescent and family:

o convene a National Mental Health Summit on Infant, Child, Adolescent and Family  Mental Health including key stakeholders in order to develop a dedicated Infant Child  and Adolescent Mental Health Plan (including a structured support system for children  with mental health problems) to complement the National Mental Health Plan 2003-

2008.

enate Se mittee on Mental Health

o fund preventative mental health programs to help individuals, particularly young people,  develop life skills which will help them to deal adequately with whatever life throws at  them with the aim of reducing the number needing acute support services in the future.

ensure that the right mix of medical services is available to treat mental illness in all  aged care settings and that the current shortages and lack of incentives and facilities to  treat aged Australians are overcome.

Recognise the need for specialised staff and facilities to complement geriatric services  to meet the needs for psychogeriatric care for both mental illness and dementia.

develop mechanisms such as telemedicine, specialist outreach etc to make a higher  level of mental health medical services available to rural Australians. Provide greater  training to the existing medical workforce in the treatment of mental illness and ensure  that the special needs of the mentally ill are considered when acute care services in

rural areas are being reviewed.

Alcohol and Other Drug (AOD) services:

o Provide appropriate care for people with psychiatric disorders in a place of safety (not  gaol) where they can receive appropriate treatment.

The provision of AOD services by teaching hospitals should be a requirement for their  accreditation and the Australian Council of Health Care Standards should be asked to  develop the criteria. Accreditation should be only provisional and for 12 months if they  are found wanting.

Bringing together mental health and AOD and making them both a part of the national  chronic disease strategy and initiatives.

Support consultation liaison psychiatry which will pick up much of the overt AOD  problems in hospitals and redress the great lack of care for many patients with  depression, anxiety, somatoform disorder, chronic pain, chronic fatigue states, COPD,  heart disease and diabetes etc.

The elderly:

o

Australians living in rural and remote areas:

o

And more generally:

Recognise that services have become too highly specialised around treating one issue  and that this renders them poorly equipped to deal with mental illnesses co-morbidity  with substance abuse problems (AOD) or mental illness comorbidity with significant  physical illnesses services.

Recognise that over-specialised services are not the best way to provide appropriate  patient-focused health care for special needs groups or for the general population of  people with a mental condition.

Recognise that the provision of mental health services at the same time as, or very  adjacent to, general medical or surgical services, leads to much better outcomes and a  significant improvement in the cost effectiveness of the health system.

Provide significant funding for mental health services in general hospital facilities,  including out-patient general medical and surgical health services, attached to general  health funding rather than mental health funding.

AMA Submission to the Senate Select Committee on Mental Health 41  .el  AMA

Reference (9): Support of Primary Carers

u Provide primary carers, children of patients and other family members with support,  education and training. Provide further opportunities for primary carers to be involved  in the overall treatment management of their loved ones.

Encourage carer involvement in care plans while recognising that it is necessarily  subject to patient consent (which should never be coerced).  o

Reference (h): Primary Health Care

Expand the Better Outcomes in Mental Health initiative, engaging all GPs and  without a link to a Service Incentive payment so as to improve the availability of  psychiatric support services to all GPs.

Recognise the very important role that GPs play in primary mental health care  (especially in the areas of depression, anxiety and sleep disturbance together with the  management of people with multiple co-morbid chronic conditions) and, in that context,  understand that the current MBS fee structure discourages long GP consultations and  works against quality primary care.

Recognise that GPs will not be able to ‘pick up the pieces’ when other mental health  services, public specialist mental health services in particular, are not able to provide  sufficient services to their consumers, particularly those with supposedly less serious  mental illnesses and those in extreme disadvantage, including financial disadvantage.

Support innovative funding initiatives to help GPs lift the quality and quantity of mental  health services they provide with emphasis on early intervention and prevention as well  as improving support of GPs by psychiatrists in private practice.

Reference (i): Reducing latrogenesis

o Recognise that doctor produced illness is not a material problem in mental health,  rather the main cause of continuing suffering in the mental health area is the lack of  adequate access to adequate and professional mental health services for proper  medical management of mental health conditions.

Recognise that the use of this term “iatrogenesis” in the Terms of Reference indicates  a carryover of stigma, into the formulation of ideas for this Inquiry. Two common  stigmas are (1) that mental illness can be treated by almost anyone because it is just  commonsense dressed up; and so, does not require doctors for treatment provision  and (2) conversely, that doctors involved in mental health care are causing much of the  disturbance in their patients.

Support greater consumer participation (the AMA has been at the forefront of the  development of innovative partnerships between consumers, consumer organisations  and the medical profession and has been instrumental in assisting the formation of  national consumer participation groups in mental health).

o

o

Reference (1): Mental Health in Detention

o Take immediate steps to end the practice of holding children in immigration detention  centres.

Recognise the special problems of asylum seekers while in and following immigration  detention (such as the very high level of post traumatic stress disorder) and ensure that  these special needs are met (including the need for translation services). Assess the  scope for relocating immigration detention centres closer to major centres so that

appropriate mental health care can be more easily provided.

o

A>&

n to the Senate Select Committee on Mental Health 42 4r  AMA

o Recognise the overwhelming evidence of the poor state of mental health of those  people that end up being detained under the criminal justice system and support better  resourcing for mental health services to people in detention including forensic services.

Support much greater use of diversionary programmes, especially for young offenders  and first time offenders as well as addressing psychosocial difficulties of young  offenders and first time offenders in order to try to prevent further offending behaviour.

o

Reference (k): Detention and Seclusion within Mental Health Facilities

o Recognise that, in a framework where the objective is to provide appropriate high  quality mental health care, detention and seclusion of the patient within a mental health  facility can be the most appropriate form of treatment.

Ensure that where detention and seclusion occurs on an involuntary basis within  mental health facilities, there is full compliance with human rights instruments.

Recognise also that employers have moral and legal responsibilities to maintain safe  workplaces in the interests of other patients and staff.

u

o

Reference (I): Adequacy of Education and De-stigmatisation

n Recognise that high quality educational information (for consumers, carers and the  community) is an important part of the total process towards de-stigmatisation (poor  quality or inaccurate or misleading information often reinforces stigmas associated with  mental illness and its treatment).

Ensure that consumer and carer groups, as well as professional groups, are fully  engaged in the preparation and review of such educational material.

Reference (m): Proficiency and Accountability of Other Community Agencies

o Recognise the ongoing need for significant effort to educate community agencies (such  as housing, employment, law enforcement and even general health services) to reduce  the incidence of these agencies dealing with people suffering from mental illness in a  s tig m atisi ng way.

Recognise the critical importance of such programs securing the strong support and  “buy-in” of leaders within those agencies, both administrative leaders and leaders  within the professional groups involved.

Recognise that the effectiveness of educational material depends not only on strong  priority in early training but also in follow up with ongoing re-education and revision  programs at a later time.

n

o

Reference (p): New Modes of Delivery, including E-technology

u Recognise that, in a framework where the objective is to provide appropriate high  quality mental health care, clinicians will always be prepared to investigate new modes  of service delivery which might lead to greater productivity and better outcomes. The  key role for government is to ensure that new modes are investigated in a way that  does not compromise patient safety.

Recognise that Australia has been a leader in the development of telehealth or  telepsychiatry but that tele-mental health has not developed more, largely because of a  lack of governmental interest, despite the high demonstrated needs of rural and remote  populations where such technologies would appear to have potential.

Beware of overblown hype around the issue of e-health records as a new way forward  for communication between clinicians. In the mental health sphere, e-health records  offer quite a number of opportunities for better communication but also provide a

APPENDIX A: SPGPPS

The Strategic Planning Group for Private Psychiatric Services (SPGPPS) is the peak  mental health alliance that brings together diverse stakeholders to identify and agree on  issues directed at improving mental health services in the Australian private sector. This  alliance is a strong partnership between the following stakeholders.

Australian Medical Association (AMA);

Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists (RANZCP);

Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP);

Australian Private Hospitals Association Limited (APHA);

Australian Health Insurance Association (AHIA);

Australia Government Department of Health and Ageing (DOHA);  Australian Government Department of Veterans’ Affairs (DVA); and

Mental health consumers and their carers.

The alliance seeks to not only better inform each stakeholder’s own policy processes, but  also to reach agreement on actions that will improve practice and better integrate mental  health care across the private and public sectors. The SPGPPS and its Working Groups  meet regularly to work toward achieving these goals, particularly in relation to the following  key areas that are critical to the provision of high quality private sector mental health  services:

Participation of private sector consumers and carers;

The funding and uptake of innovative models of service delivery that have been shown  to be effective and feasible;

Flexibility of funding arrangements so that the implementation of appropriate models of  care is not inhibited;

Strong linkages, co-ordination, and continuity of care between GPs, Psychiatrists and  private hospitals; and

The quality, availability and utilisation of information regarding private sector mental  health services.

Centralised Data Management Service

In 2001, the SPGPPS established a Centralised Data Management Service (CDMS) to  improve the quality, availability and utilisation of information regarding private sector mental  health services through the implementation of a National Model for the Collection and  Analysis of a Minimum Data Set with Outcome Measures for Private, Hospital-based,

Psychiatric Services. Participation in the National Model by 43 of the 46 Australian private  hospitals with psychiatric beds (hospitals) enables those hospitals and payers to evaluate  and monitor the quality and effectiveness of the care provided by those participating  hospitals.

National Network of Private Psychiatric Sector Consumers and Carers

In 2003, the AMA, RANZCP, APHA, AHIA and beyondblue financially supported the  establishment of the National Network of Private Psychiatric Sector Consumers and  Carers, to improve the participation of mental health consumers and their carers in private  sector mental health services. The National Network is working to better involve consumers

and their carers in policy decisions around the design, delivery and evaluation of private  sector mental health services, and to be an effective advocate of their rights and  responsibilities.

The work of the SPGPPS, its CDMS, and National Network is supported through the  SPGPPS Secretariat, located at the offices of the Federal AMA in Canberra. The SPGPPS  website is located at: www.sDqpmcom.au.
