PRESENTER:

Can you tell us exactly when you're going to give us your costings for everything, how you're  going to pay for the promises, and is it going to be in enough time for everyone to weigh it up  properly before the election?

HOCKEY:

Yes.

PRESENTER:

What day is that going to drop on?

HOCKEY:

You'll see in the next few days, not many days.

PRESENTER:

I'm a very slow reader Joe.

HOCKEY:

Well, it's mainly numbers, so you might get away with that.

PRESENTER:

So it's not going coincide with the election blackout is it? So you'll wait to the Wednesday  when there's no advertising.

HOCKEY:

Well, hang on, we've announced $17 billion of savings. It's like a scene out of Life of Brian,  what did the Romans ever do for us. We've already announced we're cutting the refugee  intake from 20,000 to 13,750, and that saves $1.3 billion.

PRESENTER:

Did you just compare yourself to the Roman Empire?

HOCKEY:

No, Monty Python actually.

PRESENTER:

Well the Life of Brian and Monty Python, they were funny, so...

HOCKEY:

Dave, I'm really working on it. If we don't get elected, and I'm Shadow Minister for Aged  Care, then I'll moonlight on your program.

PRESENTER:

You had your campaign launch yesterday - I was reading today that the reason parties delay  their campaign launch is because once you have the campaign launch you can no longer  travel on tax payer money anymore? You have to travel on party money, is that true?

HOCKEY:

It might be, but it is no the main driver. The main driver is that it is all about momentum in  the last few weeks. But the fact that Kevin Rudd hasn't launched his campaign, and there's  what  - only eleven days to go - it is a bit odd to leave it to the last minute.

PRESENTER:

Still on the dollars, your Paid Parental Leave scheme has obviously had a lot of publicity, it's  extremely expensive. I'm not sure how you can go around the country arguing that we should  be economically prudent and then launch a scheme like that, but you're going to do it. With  your scheme, your wife - you've had three children - she would have earned $225,000 for  those three kids because you had three children at different times. My wife would have  earned $140,000. .....Should women be on those sorts of salaries, big salaries...



HOCKEY:

We are one of a handful of countries in the world that does not have parental leave payments  at replacement wages. We are one only a small handful of countries. Now let's be fair-dinkum  about it.  80% of the recipients of our Paid Parental Leave Scheme are earning less than  $65,000 per year.

PRESENTER:

But you're still paying it to women on big big salaries, aren't you?

HOCKEY:

But that's what they earn, right. And compared to men, women hardly make the track. So  from our perspective…

PRESENTER:

Well, every other welfare benefit is means-tested.

HOCKEY:

Well, but it's not a welfare benefit, it is a workplace entitlement.

PRESENTER:

It's a welfare benefit.

HOCKEY:

It is a workplace entitlement. Small business could not afford to pay it. They weren't paying it  to women. Therefore what we have said is women - 80% of the recipients - are earning less  then $65,000 a year and it is completely lost in the debate. A lot of the critics are men and  people who have their workplace provide that entitlement, but a lot of workplaces haven't  done it and a lot of small business could never afford it.

PRESENTER:

On the subject of women, we saw Tony Abbott's daughters give him a massive pump up  yesterday, I mean, they really like Dad. I mean, that's a shock. No, I mean..

HOCKEY:

You're not familiar with it?

PRESENTER:

No, my two year old, I wouldn't dare let her to do a speech for me to be honest. What about  your kids, mate? When are they going to be ready to pump up Joe?



HOCKEY:

Sometime away, I think so.

PRESENTER:

How old are your kids?

HOCKEY:

Well, first of all I have to convince them. They are only 8, 6, and 3 so I've got a way to go.  But obviously...

PRESENTER:

You're not that popular at home are you, when you arrive home they go out?

HOCKEY:

Gee

PRESENTER:

Is that not correct?

HOCKEY:

It's kind of true.

PRESENTER:

If we can get back to some policy...

HOCKEY:

Sorry, Steve is sledging me. I come on the program and he sledges me.

PRESENTER:

He's not going to be popular when he gets home either. He's been sprouting out his wife's  income all over national TV.

PRESENTER:

So if I can get back to some policy.

HOCKEY:

Sure..



PRESENTER:

Tony Abbott announced on Friday that he was going to buy back rickety fishing boats from  the Indonesian at a price tag of something around $20 million. The Indonesian Government  this afternoon described it as crazy. As the guy who has to write the cheques to these boat  owners, do you reckon it's crazy?

HOCKEY:

No, I think it was misinterpreted. Because on the ground…

PRESENTER:

Sorry, are you not buying back old rickety boats that aren't seaworthy?

HOCKEY:

If it disrupts the activity of the smugglers - if they are about to load people on a boat and you  have a situation where you can disrupt the activity, then you would do it. But the suggestion...

PRESENTER:

So you buy the bad boats and they buy better boats? Seriously, do they get onto the Trading  Post?

HOCKEY:

They can probably...

PRESENTER:

This is a genuinely ridiculous strategy and I'm not the only one person who thinks it Joe.

HOCKEY:

Well, you're entitled to think that....

PRESENTER:

Myself and the Indonesian Government on this one, think it's crazy.

HOCKEY:

That is quite a partnership, I would not have picked that. But...

PRESENTER:

Don't we have to work with the Indonesian Government to solve this problem?

HOCKEY:

We do Charley…

PRESENTER:

But you said it's just me and the Indonesian Government.

HOCKEY:

Let me get word in here,

PRESENTER:

That's so much fun though...

HOCKEY:

If you can disrupt the activity of the people smugglers; if they're about to load a boat with  people there and you can steal a boat from under them or take it from under them, then great.  That disrupts their activity and I think that's part of the equation. But it is not the whole  equation, obviously. I don't think we are going to be buying every boat in Indonesia, not  under my watch.

PRESENTER:

I don't think we've got the money.

HOCKEY:

No, I don't think we do either.

PRESENTER:

When I said you weren't funny before, I lied. You are funny.

PRESENTER:

We've been trying to get Tony Abbott to come sit where you are, he keeps sending you,  which is ok…

HOCKEY:

What is wrong with me?

PRESENTER:

We are delighted.

HOCKEY:



Come on, give me a cheer. They like me, you guys pour out on me, I come on. 'Oh why aren't  you Tony Abbott?'

PRESENTER:

I actually use the word delighted, but you didn’t hear that bit.

PRESENTER:

I would be happy to sell a boat to you, I could tell you.

PRESENTER:

But he is going to sit down with our old mate here on Wednesday and have a chat for us.  Anything you think Steve should grill him on?

PRESENTER:

You're going to get him to give me the questions!

PRESENTER:

Are you going to go as hard on Tony as you went on Joe?

PRESENTER:

Harder.

PRESENTER:

Oh yeah, we'll see.

HOCKEY:

Yes.

PRESENTER:

Hang on, I think Tony's people might be calling. It is great to have you here with us though  Joe. Can I say, every other politician in the country looks exhausted, but you don't. I don't  know what your secret is, but you're looking good.

HOCKEY:

Yes, fresh as a daisy, fresh as a daisy. And they love me!

PRESENTER:

Would you please thank Joe Hockey.
