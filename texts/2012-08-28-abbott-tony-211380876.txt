TONY ABBOTT:

It’s terrific to be here at Rocky’s Own Transport. I want to thank Bryan Smith and his team for making Senator Ian  Macdonald and myself so welcome. I want to particularly thank Rod Carriage for the tips he gave me as I drove one of  their vehicles up here to the depot this morning.

This is one of Rockhampton’s most important businesses. It’s probably the largest transport company operating in  Rockhampton, an important part of the local economy, an important source of wealth and employment and of course this  is one of the many businesses that will suffer under Labor’s carbon tax. Trucking businesses suffer a triple whammy under  the carbon tax. Their power bills go up and up and up. Most trucking companies have refrigerated trucks. That means  their refrigerant bills go up and up and up, and from the 1st of July 2014 there is a carbon tax directly on heavy transport.  That’s why this is a python squeeze. It hurts from day one, but as time goes by, it’s just going to get worse and worse and  worse for our economy.

No lesser person than the former Labor Treasurer of Queensland Keith DeLacy said on the weekend that the carbon tax  is an act of collective insanity. It hurts jobs, it’s hurts families under enormous cost of living pressure. It is bad for our  country because it hits us but it doesn’t hit our competitors. That’s why the smartest thing government can do, if it wants to  make our companies more competitive and our families feel more secure, is axe the tax. It’s also emblematic of everything  that’s wrong with the current government: great big new tax, great big new bureaucracy, great big new slush fund, great  big new handouts. This is typical of Labor’s contemporary style. It’s one of the reasons why Labor governments are  getting booted out right around our country, because the public understand that you just can’t keep going living beyond  your means, you just can’t keep going endlessly burdening our economy, the productive parts of our economy, with more  and more costs.

Just a couple of other issues before I ask Bryan and Ian to say a few words. Kirsten Livermore, the local member, has  been making excuses for a bad government. Where was Kirsten Livermore when Julia Gillard wanted to hit local coal  mines with a carbon tax? Where was Kirsten Livermore when Julia Gillard wanted to hit local coal mines with a mining  tax? She has basically been a doormat for a bad government rather than a strong representative of local people.

Finally, we’ve had four more boats in just 24 hours. If you want to stop the boats, you need all the policies that are  necessary to be effective. Yes, you’ve got to have rigorous offshore processing on Nauru, but you’ve got to have  temporary protection visas to deny the people smugglers a product to sell and, most importantly, you’ve got to have the  willingness to turn boats around where it’s safe to do so. If you want the right results, you’ve got to have the right resolve,  and that’s what this government is so singularly lacking.

I’m now going to ask Bryan Smith to say a few words and then Senator Macdonald, who represents this area from the  Coalition’s perspective.

Tony Abbott Federal Member for Warringah | Leader of the Opposition

BRYAN SMITH (Chief Executive Officer, Rocky’s Own Transport):

G’day guys. Look, I’m not as polished as Tony, so I have to read off some notes, but I needed to get this off my chest.  First of all, I’m not into bashing federal Labor. My father voted Labor all his life and I have the utmost respect for his beliefs  and what Labor used to stand for. I myself voted Labor up until the second term of the Howard Government, based on  what I believed Labor once stood for. It was a fair go for all.

Unfortunately, due to the current situation that exists in the federal Parliament, this Labor government has shown it’s only  too willing to compromise its beliefs to appease a small group of independents and minority parties to maintain power at  all costs. They have been hijacked by an intellectual arrogance and ideology that will be eventually found out to be  irrelevant to this country’s future. It’s all about spin, 24-hour news cycle and no real substance.

Wayne Swan’s assertion in the recent days about the carbon has been introduced and the sky hasn’t fallen - we’ve had a  carbon tax for 60 days and anyone with half a brain is going to know that it’s going to take five to 10 years to see the real  impact of this carbon tax. If our trading partners adopted similar legislation, then it would make some sense. However, all  this legislation is going to do, I believe, is render Australian business uncompetitive.

If the carbon tax, as well as the Government’s agenda in its entirety has the impact on Australia and its mining and  manufacturing sectors, as I suspect it will, we will just keep exporting jobs offshore and before we know it, it’s going to be  too late. That’s all I’ve got to say.

IAN MACDONALD:

Thanks very much, Bryan. I mean, what more can I say? Tony, thanks for coming to the north. Bryan, thanks for having us  here today. Look, Tony, one of the important things that you’re doing here is highlighting the impact of the carbon tax and  the mining tax on central Queensland and the coal mines, the other mines that keep Australia going. Just recently, the

Rockhampton City Council budgeted for an extra $3 million to pay for the carbon tax alone. That’s on landfill, on their  energy, on their fuel. That equates to, on average, $60 per rate payer in this city and that’s a direct result of the carbon  tax. The sooner we can get rid of it, the sooner it will be better for the people of central Queensland. Thanks for coming,  Tony.

TONY ABBOTT:

Thanks so much, Ian. Ok, any questions?

QUESTION:

Is this company losing money from the carbon tax yet?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well look, every trucking company faces a carbon tax on its trucking operations from the 1st of July 2014, if this  government gets re-elected. It faces much higher power bills as of now and it faces much higher refrigerant bills as of  now. So it just puts a squeeze on the operations of every trucking company in the country.

QUESTION:

Opinion polls seem to be showing that community concern about the carbon tax is fading. Why do you think that is?

TONY ABBOTT:

I don’t accept the premise of the question. I simply make the point that every single person is going to feel the squeeze of  the carbon tax on their power bills and every single person is ultimately impacted by power bills. Again, I want to draw  people’s attention to the declaration of the former Labor treasurer of Queensland Keith De Lacy on the weekend: the

carbon tax is an act of collective insanity. Now that’s not Tony Abbott going over the top. That is the considered statement  of the former Labor treasurer of Queensland.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, do you support Campbell Newman’s job cuts?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think that what we have seen in all of the states, but particularly here in Queensland are Coalition governments that have  got to clean up the terrible mess that they have inherited from the Labor Party. Now in Queensland we have 60,000 more  public servants today than we did a decade ago. We had public service costs growing at nine per cent a year. Of course,  the incoming government has to deal with that and of course the necessary tough decisions aren't always going to be  popular. But if you are going to restore Queensland's AAA credit rating, if you are going to deal with $100 billion of debt,  the $10 billion of deficit that the incoming Coalition government inherited, you’ve got to do the tough things and the tough  things are the right things.

QUESTION:

Are you going to do the same at the federal level?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look our situation is inevitably going to be different, but the point I have been making for years now is that there are  20,000 more federal public servants, there are 20,000 more people on the Commonwealth payroll today than there were  when the former Coalition government left office. I think we can run a slimmer and more effective government in Canberra  too.

QUESTION:

Do you think it was fair that you were given a full briefing about the job cuts before the people in the firing line had been  told?

TONY ABBOTT:

I am simply quoting from publicly available figures as to the blowout in the size and the costs of the Queensland public  service.

QUESTION:

Have you been briefed by the Premier about the job cuts that are happening? Did you get briefed last night?

TONY ABBOTT:

I talk to my brother Coalition premiers, my Coalition opposition leaders, I talk to them all the time and look, in the end, they  call the shots for their states but I certainly talk to them frequently and I have got to say that the Coalition has been a very  effective team right around Australia.

QUESTION:

How do you feel for the families of those people affected directly by those state government cuts?

TONY ABBOTT:

My heart bleeds for everyone who is doing it tough right now. Wherever people are doing it tough, I feel for them and that  is why it is so critically important that government doesn't make a bad situation worse and the carbon tax is making a bad  situation worse. It would be a lot easier to take the Labor Party in Queensland seriously if they had stood up for  Queensland against the carbon tax and against the mining tax and in favour of the Australian Building and Construction  Commission which Labor has abolished which has allowed the rule of law to be swept aside on building sites in Australia.  So, as I said, I feel for everyone who is doing it tough right now and my pledge is, as a Coalition, we will make your life

easier by getting rid of unnecessary taxes.

QUESTION:

John Howard doesn't seem too worried about Chinese investment. Why are you?

TONY ABBOTT:

I welcome foreign investment. I absolutely welcome foreign investment, but it has got to be strictly in Australia's national  interest and that is why we have got a Foreign Investment Review Board to determine that that is exactly the case.

QUESTION:

You support the policy to send asylum seekers to Nauru and Manus Island. As you said, four boats have arrived in the  past 24 hours. So what’s the plan when the centres fill up?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, we invented the policy of sending illegal boat people to Nauru. We invented the policy of sending illegal arrivals to  Nauru, but there are three elements to a successful policy to stop the boats. First of all, you have got to have Nauru and  Manus, yes. You’ve got to have temporary protection visas and the current government is desperately resisting that. Third,  and most importantly, you’ve got to have the determination and the willingness to turn boats around where it’s safe to do  so and that is something that this government has never been prepared to do, despite Kevin Rudd promising that it would  just a day before the 2007 election.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, there have been scuffles in a union protest in Melbourne today, who do you blame for that?

TONY ABBOTT:

I blame the fact that the rule of law is not operating as it should on major construction sites because the federal  Government abolished the Australian Building and Construction Commission which was set up in 2005 by the Howard  Government as a result of the Cole Royal Commission which I established as Workplace Relations Minister. It is critical  that we re-establish the rule of law in a tough industry. The best way to do that is via the Australian Building and  Construction Commission and one of the first acts of an incoming Coalition government in Canberra would be to restore  the ABCC with full powers.

QUESTION:

You’ve got people like Peter Reith coming out saying we should have individual contracts in IR. Why don’t you support  that?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, I respect my former parliamentary colleagues but the gentleman in question hasn't been in the Parliament since  2001, and look, I think his time has passed when it comes to this issue.

QUESTION:

A Liberal strategist, Grahame Morris, he’s called Leigh Sales a cow over the interview she did with you the other night on  the 7.30 report. Do you think Leigh Sales is a cow?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, I think people should be treated with respect. Politicians should be treated with respect. Journalists should be  treated with respect. I think we should have, as far as is humanly possible, a civil discourse in this country. I understand  the gentleman in question has apologised. Thank you.
