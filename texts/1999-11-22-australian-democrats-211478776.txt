Media Release

Senator Andrew Bartlett

Australian Democrats’

Senator for Queensland

Â

Temporary 
visas will not stop boat people and will

worsen 
the plight of genuine refugees.

Â

The undersigned organisations 
and individuals oppose the new immigration regul  ations which extend the uncertainty facing refugees 
by granting temporary three year visas rather than permanent haven, 
to unauthorised arrivals recognised as refugees. We call on Labor to 
join the Democrats in voting against these regulations in the Senate.

Â

This new requirement for repeated applications by 
those already granted refugee status will:

Â

Ã¢ÂÂ¢Â not affect the numbers 
of boat people coming to Australia;

Â

Ã¢ÂÂ¢Â greatly increase immigration 
bureaucratic and legal costs;

Â

Ã¢ÂÂ¢Â contravene Australia's 
obligatio  ns under the UN Refugee Convention; and

Â

Ã¢ÂÂ¢Â harm genuine refugees through increasing uncertainty 
and hardship and preventing integration into the Australian community.

Â

We call on the Government 
to focus on preventing people-smuggling schemes while still he  lping refugees in need.
