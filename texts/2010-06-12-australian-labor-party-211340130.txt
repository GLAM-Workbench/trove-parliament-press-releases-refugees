First transfer to Curtin Immigration Detention  Centre under way  Saturday, 12 June 2010

The Curtin Immigration Detention Centre is reopening today with 94 people being  transferred from Christmas Island, the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship,  Senator Chris Evans, announced today.

The facility, about 40km south east of Derby in Western Australia, will be used to  accommodate asylum seekers who are subject to the current processing  suspension.

‘The first transfer flight is now on its way to Curtin with 94 people. Tomorrow another  flight will bring a further 95 people. All 189 are single male Afghan asylum seekers,’  Senator Evans said.

‘It makes sense for the government to manage this group of asylum seekers in one  secure location and the Curtin facility is well placed to provide this accommodation.’

Initial upgrade work has been finalised to bring the centre up to a suitable standard  for the accommodation of adult men in immigration detention.

‘We are ensuring appropriate support services are available to all clients. These will  include departmental case managers, mental health support teams, medical staff,  interpreting services and education staff,’ Senator Evans said.

‘Additional accommodation is being brought online progressively and it is expected  that further transfers will occur. All relevant services and amenities are already in  place in line with those available at other immigration detention centres, however, we  will be expanding these facilities over the next few months.

‘The demountable accommodation blocks consist of two-person rooms with a  number of shared bathroom blocks.’

All those being transferred have received appropriate health and other initial checks  at Christmas Island.

‘The transfer of irregular maritime arrivals does not change their legal status or give  them access to onshore processing arrangements or legal avenues of appeal,’  Senator Evans said.
