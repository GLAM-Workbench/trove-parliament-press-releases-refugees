CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY

Your industry, the petroleum industry, provides the life blood

for the transportation sector. Transportation plays a

particularily important role in a country such as Australia

where vast distances need to be covered in good time. It is

to your credit that petroleum is so efficiently provided, even

though the product has to meet stringent technical

specifications, that change with seasons and geographical

location. That you can provide this life blood at such a low

price is another tribute to your industry. I find it amazing

that the price of petrol per litre is actually comparable to

the drinks you are being served at your dinner table tonight.

These drinks probably take no more than a few months to a few

years to mature, yet petroleum products are the culmination of

millions of years of work by mother nature followed by a

sophisticated refining process.  Even despite the current

Middle East crisis, petrol per litre is cheaper than Coca-

Cola.

The question can be asked as to whether the price we pay for

this marvellous natural but limited resource properly reflects

its real value and whether the unrealistic underpricing of

this commodity is leading to inefficient and extravagant

usage. We must also be aware that there is another cost that

has not been properly accounted for in the price of

petroleum - the cost of environmental damage.

There ere significant environment impacts arising from the

manufacture, delivery and use of petroleum products including

exploration and mining, transportation over land or sea,

processing and refining, storage and ultimately the use in our

transportation system. Such impacts range from local problems

such as dust, smoke, odour and smog generated by our fleet of

petrol and diesel vehicles, larger scale damage such as oil

spills, regional concerns such as acid rain to global problems

such as the greenhouse effect.

Australia has a good record in controlling the emissions

arising from the use of petrol in motor vehicles. Such

emissions used to be responsible for over 50% of the smog that

affect our larger cities and almost all of the carbon monoxide

and atmospheric lead. However, such emissions have been

significantly reduced with the national introduction in 1986

of unleaded petrol and more stringent motor vehicle emission

standards that require the use of catalysts.

The smooth operation in the introduction of this new fuel

across the whole nation, involving thousands of service

stations and major changes in the refinery and delivery

systems is again another demonstration of the excellence in

technical, managerial and operational skills of your industry.

Your industry is now faced with another challenge - global

greenhouse warming. I consider that this is one of the most

Important environmental issues that we face today. As

transportation is a major contributor of the greenhouse gas

Ã¢ÂÂ   iOO'Â·. fc>pil Ã¢ÂÂ

carbon dioxide, your industry will undoubtedly be called upon

to contribute to efforts to address this global environmental

threat. With your record of technical excellence,

resourcefulness and responsible attitude towards environmental

concerns, I am sure you will once again rise to the occasion

and meet the challenge.

Contrary to some reports in the media, global climate warming

is a real scientific phenomenon. This is the conclusion of

two years' work undertaken by a scientific working group of

the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the IPCC, set

up by the United Nations Environment Programme and World

Meteorological Organization.

There are a number of human-induced greenhouse gases the most

significant of them is carbon dioxide which roughly accounts

for 50% of the warming potential of such gases. Scientists

have confirmed that atmospheric carbon dioxide has increased

by about 25% since the industrial revolution some 200 years

ago and this rising trend will accelerate unless we do

something about it.

The scientific working group of the IPCC, consisting of

hundreds of scientists from all over the world, has predicted

that if we continue with our 'business as usual' way of life,

temperatures would rise by 3 degrees Celsius and sea level by

65 centimetres by the end of the next century. This may not

seem to be a big change at first sight. However, its

significance becomes more apparent when we realise that this

5

' if/y KÂ»Â» y r M  Popt-ri

rate of change is greater than that seen over the past 10,000

years.  In fact during the last ice age the global average

temperature was only approximately 5 degrees Celsius below

what It is today.

The expected temperature rise would cause changes in the

world's climate. Generally speaking, the equatorial and

temperate weather zones would shift towards the poles which in

our regions means towards the south.

Computer models simulating the likely outcomes of global

warming are constantly being improved so that we can forecast

with greater confidence climate changes on a regional scale.

The Bureau of Meteorology, which is part of my portfolio, is

working on modelling. My Department is also funding the CSIRO

on its work in this area.

Although at this stage scientists are not in a position to

forecast with 100% accuracy the detailed changes at specific

regions in Australia, they can tell us the impacts that are

likely to occur under different climate change scenarios. In

general there will be some serious effects on Australia.

Since most of our population is concentrated along our narrow

coastline we are vulnerable to significant changes in sea

level.

The expected penetration of warmer climate into more southern

parts of the continent has raised concerns about the spread of

R e o fiÂ« J  Ptipcr.

tropical diseases such as those carried by mosquitoes. The

cyclone belt is expected to shift further south to affect

areas so for spared from severe winds and storm surges.

Rainfall over the southwestern part of Australia is expected

to decrease and this would threaten the viability of our wheat

industry there.

The expected rate of climate change may be faster than the

ecological system can cope with. Those systems that cannot

migrate fast enough will be wiped out. Similar fate will

befall those systems with no escape routes such as those on

smaller islands or the cool alpine regions near the peaks of

our mountain ranges.

However, we must not be short-sighted and worry only about

Australia. Greenhouse is a global phenomenon and its impact

is worldwide. A change in the climate could have drastic

consequences in many of the subsistence food producing regions

of the world. Rises in sea level would have devastating

effects on low lying regions such as Bangladesh and some south

Pacific islands. As a consequence thousands and even millions

of people might be turned into environmental refugees and it

would be inconceivable for Australia to ignore their plights

and not come to their assistance. Major changes in the

location and productivity of the food producing regions of the

world is also a potential threat to world stability.

Ã¢ÂÂ 100'V Hctyfied Paper  > ( T e d

The Government has so for taken a forefront position on the

issue of climate change. We have participated activity in

major international fora on climate change and my Department

has an active program on greenhouse which includes research,

information and education.

Last month, the Government decided to adopt as an interim

planning target to reduce all greenhouse gas emissions,

excluding substances such as CFCs that are already controlled

because of their effects on the ozone layer, by 20% from the

1988 level by the year 2005. As an intermediate step,

emissions in the year 2000 are to be stabilised at 1988

levels.

This target has obvious implications for the petroleum

industry. Currently, registered vehicles in Australia

contribute just over 20% of fossil fuel related carbon dioxide

emissions in Australia. The trend of increase in motor

vehicle usage is forecast to be maintained and it is clear

that transportation is a sector that has to contribute to our

target of greenhouse gas emission reductions.

Meeting greenhouse gas emission targets need not mean that we

have to do without or lower our standard of living. Studies

have shown that to achieve significant reduction in greenhouse

gas emissions, we need not stifle economic growth. We can

achieve this environmental goal while maintaining the services

that we need. We can achieve that by improving the efficiency

in the ways we use energy and by promoting the use of lees

h?

Â·.){*Â»Â·Ã¢ÂÂ¦ P s y c h 'd  IN i*Â·-1

carbon intensive fuels or better still use renewable energy

sources. By adopting this approach# we are likely to end up

with net savings which is beneficial to our economy and

improve our trade competitiveness because the cost of

production would be reduced by efficiency.

Specific to your industry, it would mean that the fuel

efficiency of our vehicle fleet would have to be improved.

This is achieved by improving the performance of vehicles and

the way they are used.

The fuel economy of Australian vehicles has improved over the

past decade or so but our record is not that impressive. The

national average fuel consumption of the new passenger car

fleet has been reduced by less than 30% from 1978 to 1988.

However, the reduction for the similar period in the USA is

more than 40%.

In June this year, a Bill was introduced in the US Senate to

increase the current fuel economy levels for passenger

vehicles in the USA by 20% by the model year 1995 and 40% by

the model year 2001. This is the order of magnitude we would

expect our Australian vehicles to deliver. Some of us may

have some reservations about our capacity to achieve this.

However, I was reminded that the Sarich engine, an Australian

invention, is already 30% more fuel efficient than

contemporary engines and I understand the Sarich engine is

very close to commercial production. There is much technology

available to improve the fuel efficiency of vehicles,

r.(O'Â·Â· P e n *

involving for example aerodynamics/ tyres and lighter

materials for various components of vehicles.

A number of vehicle prototypes have been developed with a much

lower fuel consumption than the Australian average of 9.1

litres per 100 kilometres. For example two Japanese imports

into Australia/ the Suzuki Swift and the Diahatsu Charade,

have a fuel consumption of 4.6 - 6.2 litres per 100

kilometres, considerably less than that of the Australian

average.

There are many opportunities for fuel substitution to reduce

carbon dioxide emissions. Natural gas, which produces about

three-quarters of carbon dioxide as oil products for the same

unit of energy, is already being used in some heavy vehicles

and its application is being extended into passenger vehicles.

Ethanol, produced from sugar cane, is effectively a renewable

source of energy. It is a potential candidate to substitute

or mix with petrol.

Further down the track, hydrogen produced by solar energy may

fuel our vehicle by the early part of the next century.

There are a number of measures that can be applied to reduce

fuel consumption. One measure that has already been adopted

in some European countries is a carbon tax. The tax would be

proportional to the amount of carbon dioxide produced when the

fuel is consumed. In this way a higher tax would be imposed

< <

llV '*7 I te c y v t<1 f tip c r '

on fuels with a higher carbon content acting as an incentive

not only to use less fuel but also more 'greenhouse friendly'

fuels.

Other incentives could involve restructuring registration fees

by imposing a 'fuel guzzler' tax and offering a 'fuel sipper'

rebate, depending on the fuel efficiency of a vehicle.

Funds raised by such measures would go towards financing a

more efficient transport sector. For example, upgrading

public transport and research and development of alternative

fuels.

All of these issues will also be considered by the Government

in the context of Ecological Sustainable Development. Working

groups, on which industry is well represented, have been

established by the Government to develop sustainable

development strategies and will be reporting on a range of

measures available to achieve greenhouse gas emission targets.

All this means that the growth in demand for oil baaed fuels

may not be maintained at the level commensurate with the

expected growth in vehicle usage and that there may be lees of

a monopoly for the use of petroleum for transportation in the

future.

It will be a challenge to your industry to meet the changes.

At the same time, there are opportunities. I wish you well in

your future endeavours.
