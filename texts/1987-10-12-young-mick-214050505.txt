MINISTER CONGRATULATES NEW COUNCILLOR

The Minister for Immigration Local Government and Ethnic   Affairs, Mick Young has sent congratulations to the first   Vietnamese-born migrant to be elected to an Australian local   Government authority.

Mr Ngo Canh Phuong,  aged 29, was elected to Fairfield City   Council in Sydney’s west in local government elections on '   September 26.

Mr Young said Mr Ngo’s hard work and determination in   winning his election showed once again that refugees brought   more to Australia than their few belongings.

"Mr Ngo said he had not encountered prejudice from non-asian   people while he was campaigning for the council election," Mr Young said.

"This perception matches the results of my Department’s   studies which show that the majority of Australians welcome   our newest arrivals and find Asian people make good   neighbours.

"The Fairfield Council will certainly benefit from elected   councillors who represent the diversity of the area," the   Minister said.

Mr Young sent a telegram to Mr Ngo congratulating him on his   election and wishing him well in his. council   responsibi1ities.
