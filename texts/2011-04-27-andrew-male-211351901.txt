E&OE……………………….…………………………………………………………………

ANDREW MALE:

Tony Abbott, welcome to the programme.

TONY ABBOTT:

G’day, good morning Andrew.

ANDREW MALE:

Now obviously you’ve done a fair few miles, or a fair few kilometres over the last 24, 48 hours or so. What  sort of impressions are you getting on things like the detention centre issue at the moment? Obviously  you’ve been up in Christmas Island. What sort of feedback are you getting?

TONY ABBOTT:

Andrew, I think wherever you look there’s a lot of disappointment with the Government because they are  getting a lot of things wrong. Whether it’s detention centre policy, whether it’s the carbon tax, the mining  tax. I suspect that there’s a lot of angst brewing over the PBS and changes to that. Obviously there’s a big  problem with the clubs sector. So there is a lot of discontent with the Government and I think a lot of  disappointment with the Prime Minister. But obviously here in Whyalla my focus is going to be on the  carbon tax because that’ll impact very heavily on OneSteel’s steelmaking operations. But we shouldn’t  forget the mining tax which will impact very heavily on OneSteel’s iron ore operations as well.

ANDREW MALE:

Well, having a look at that. Now you’ve said many times since you became the Leader of the Opposition  that there won’t be a carbon tax under a Liberal government until there is support from the rest of the world.  What sorts of measures could your government be putting in place to perhaps try to alleviate some of the  impacts of what is a very carbon based economy?

TONY ABBOTT:

Sure. Well, the issue isn’t climate change, the issue is what to do about it and the Coalition has a strong and  effective policy that we’ll spend about a billion dollars a year out of savings from the budget to plant more  trees, to produce better soils and to use smarter technology, to for instance, take the carbon dioxide from  power stations and other factories and use that not as a waste product but as an input into things like algal  production, which is very good for biodiesel and for stock feed. So we’ve got, I think, an effective policy to  meet our emissions reductions targets by 2020, and that is so different from just hitting everyone with a  great big new tax which will raise people’s cost of living and in the case of towns and cities like Port Pirie  and Whyalla, a lot of other places, the Latrobe Valley, the Hunter Valley, Gladstone in Queensland, it will  very, very seriously damage the local economy.

ANDREW MALE:

Now looking at your colleague Andrew Robb writing in The Australian the last couple of weeks saying that  perhaps uranium is something that we need to look at as a country. I mean, what’s your position on that at  the moment? Is there a place in this debate to consider whether or not uranium is part of the answer?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, uranium exports are very important to Australia and I can’t understand why the Government won’t  allow us to export uranium to India. If we’re serious about emissions free base load power that would be a  very smart thing to do. I don’t think Australia itself needs a nuclear generating industry for the very good  reason that I want our power to be relatively inexpensive, not relatively expensive and coal and gas fired  power is much, much cheaper than uranium fired power plants, and that’s why at least in the foreseeable  future I think that coal and gas are the way to go.

ANDREW MALE:

Having a look at where you are today, you are in Whyalla speaking to people from companies including as  you say OneSteel and I understand representatives from the smelting company in Port Pirie as well will join  you. What are you hearing from the industry? I mean, obviously two or three years ago industry were lined  up and almost had accepted the fact that yes there would be some sort of a carbon trading scheme and there  would be some impost. Is there still a level of acceptance do you think among those people to go down that  path or are they now saying ‘look, let’s just forget about it until we see what the rest of the world’s doing’?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think the situation is very different now than it was a couple of years ago, Andrew. Copenhagen changed  everything. What was crystal clear after Copenhagen was that the rest of the world was not moving to put a  price on carbon. To the extent that the rest of the world is acting it’s taking the kinds of measures that the  Coalition is putting forward and this is why industry now seems to think very strongly that it would be  economic lunacy to make our industries less competitive than their rivals overseas. I mean, if we put a price  on carbon in Australia we won’t use less steel, less cement, less aluminium, drive fewer cars, we’ll just  import them all from overseas.

ANDREW MALE:

Now obviously one of the major issues around the place at the moment and around all of Australia relates to  the detention centres and some of the behaviour of individuals within those centres. We are hearing that the  Government at this stage is proposing to toughen up on some of its legislation, in particular relating to  people who perhaps break the law while they are in those centres. How far is your Opposition prepared to go  along the track of bipartisanship on this? Are you prepared to support those measures that have been  discussed 24, 48 hours?

TONY ABBOTT:

Andrew, look, could I come to that in a moment. But just on the carbon tax subject before we leave it. Could  I just congratulate the Australian Workers Union for coming out so strongly, particularly in South Australia,  in defence of members jobs. I think when Wayne Hanson said that Port Pirie and Whyalla would be wiped  off the map by this tax at last we had a union official who was standing up for his members rather than  making excuses for a Government.

Now, on to the subject of border protection, look obviously we want much stronger borders and that’s what  the former Coalition Government delivered. There were just four illegal boat arrivals in detention back in  December 2007. Now there are more than 6,500 and we’ve had well over 200 boats, more than 11,000  illegal arrivals. So what the Government is doing is a weak response to a problem of its own making and  we’ll certainly support much tougher border protection measures but if they are going to adopt our policy  they’ve got to do it all and they’ve got to do it properly and I don’t see any evidence that this Government is  capable of a sustained strong response. What they seem to want at the moment is not a new policy but a  better headline.

ANDREW MALE:

So you will support them as far as they are going, but from what you are saying you’re not saying they are  going far enough?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, we haven’t even seen the legislation, Andrew. Now, let’s see the colour of their money so to speak. As  I said this is a Government which is big on talk, by gee these guys can talk. If they were more interested in  policy outcomes and less interested in media management they would be a more effective government.

ANDREW MALE:

Now you’re off to Alice Springs later in the day. This is obviously an issue that relates to a lot of our  listeners in the far north of the state as well that obviously in many cases has Alice Springs more or less as  its regional centre, not withstanding they are here in South Australia. A lot of talk about the intervention  introduced by the Howard Government, maintained by the present Government, and some talk now of  basically perhaps spreading some of the intervention measures across the rest of Australia. How does that  look for you? Can you see some of the measures in the intervention finding their way into broader Australia?

TONY ABBOTT:

I certainly think there are many important lessons in the intervention and Rowan Ramsey for one, your local  member, Andrew, has often talked to me about the need for intervention style measures in the APY Lands of  South Australia. Very late in the term of the Howard Government as the Health Minister I was in the APY  Lands just after the intervention was announced and certainly the elders there put that the problems were just  as bad and that intervention style measures should be taken.

Look, I congratulate the Rudd-Gillard Government for to a considerable measure maintaining the  intervention, but what I think we now need is a new intervention into the major urban centres and that’s  what I’ll be looking at on my trip to Alice. I’ll be talking to the traditional owners, I’ll be trying to get away  to some extent from if you like noisy lobbyists and talk to the people who have deep authority amongst the  indigenous population. I think at the end of the day we have to listen to Aboriginal people but I think we  also need to appreciate that if the kids don’t go to school, the adults don’t go to work, if the police aren’t  active to enforce the law we’re going to have big problems.

ANDREW MALE:

Do you think there is a division between the city based, well what are described perhaps as the city based  people that are representing Aboriginal communities in Canberra and Sydney, and what we’re seeing from  people like Bess Price on Q&A recently? Obviously there’s a bit of a stoush going on in the media there  within, I suppose, elements of the community. But do you see that divide in your dealings in this area?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think there are certainly divisions of opinion amongst Aboriginal people and one of the people who I hope  to catch up with in Alice is Bess Price, who I think has shown really courageous leadership in her own area.  I think Bess Price speaks with authority and authenticity for remote traditional Aboriginal people. Now, I  think there are others who can speak with authority and authenticity for the situation of urban Aboriginals.  But I think when urban Aboriginals start to get prescriptive and legislative for bush Aboriginals you’ve got  some problems, and I think that’s what we saw the other night.

ANDREW MALE:

Tony Abbott, Leader of the Opposition thanks very much for joining us this morning, and enjoy Whyalla  today and indeed Alice Springs later on.

TONY ABBOTT:

Thank you so much.

ANDREW MALE:

Thank you very much, Tony Abbott.
