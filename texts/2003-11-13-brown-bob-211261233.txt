Kurds Should Be Assessed For Return to  Australia - Brown



The 14 Turkish Kurds now in Jakarta should be assessed for return to Australia  as bonafide refugees, Greens Senator Bob Brown said.

"There are three compelling factors. First, if the Kurd's claim to be refugees from  Turkish oppression is factual, the men will be welcomed back by Australians at  large," Senator Brown said.

"Second, the ongoing damage to Australia's reputation around the world will be  halted.

"Third, we have an obligation under international law which, if ignored, leaves  Australia unable to defend other world laws," Senator Brown said.
