Cambodian elections a 'sham', Turnbull must not recognise results

Cambodia’s weekend elections are a ‘sham’ and an indictment of the corrupt Hun Sen regime, the Australian Greens said today, calling on the Turnbull Government to refuse to recognise the anti-democratic and bogus results.

“Cambodia’s election yesterday was a complete sham. Hun Sen has been systematically dismantling independent voices and political opposition in Cambodia. An election is completely illegitimate when you throw the Leader of the Opposition in jail and dissolve his party," Leader of the Australian Greens Dr Richard Di Natale said.

“It is a disgrace that only a few months ago the Turnbull Government was celebrating Australia’s strengthened ties with Cambodia, which may have been influenced by their dodgy deal to ship refugees over to the South East Asian country.

“It’s time for the Foreign Minister to do more than just meekly express concerns. We must refuse to recognise the result, and call for the release of all political prisoners.

“Australia must also follow the lead of other countries lie the US and implement targeted sanctions against the Hun Sen regime, including travel and asset sanctions against members of Hun Sen’s Government involved in undermining Cambodia’s democracy.  And of course we must end the shameful refugee deal.

“Australia should be protecting our region’s democratic freedom and standing up for Australia’s Cambodian community who have been threatened by Hun Sen. We should not be pandering to despots.”
