MEDIA RELEASE  For immediate release

Border security not a priority for Rudd

The Rudd Labor Government’s soft approach to border security has emboldened people  smugglers and failed to protect Australian shores.

Shadow Minister for Justice and Customs, Sussan Ley said the latest interception of 47  people off Western Australia’s north coast clearly demonstrates that people smugglers again  see Australia as a soft target.

“This is not a ‘seasonal’ surge as stated by the Minister for Home Affairs — the illegal arrival  of boats is happening as a direct result of the Rudd Government’s failing border protection  policies,” she said.

Ms Ley said the Minister for Home Affairs’ announcement on Sunday to bolster border patrol  efforts is not enough.

“One additional aeroplane is simply not enough to cover approximately 59,700 kilometres of  Australia’s coastline,” she said.

“Since immigration laws were relaxed five months ago and budget cuts were made to the  Australian Customs Service, Border Protection Command has been under increased  pressure to intercept illegal boats in Australian waters,” she said.

“Considering six boats have arrived since August, the Rudd Labor Government must realise  they have created a real problem and Australia’s borders will not be secure until they commit  to giving the Australian Customs Service adequate resources,” Ms Ley said.
