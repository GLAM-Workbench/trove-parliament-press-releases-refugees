THE HON RICHARD MARLES MP  SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND BORDER  PROTECTION   MEMBER FOR CORIO



E&EO TRANSCRIPT  TELEVISION INTERVIEW  SKY NEWS AM AGENDA  THURSDAY, 21 MAY 2015

SUBJECT/S: Rohingya asylum seekers

KIERAN GILBERT: I’m going to cross live to Bangkok now and to Shadow Immigration  Minister Richard Marles, Richard, Indonesia, Malaysia agreeing to temporarily take in  thousands of those asylum seekers who have been stranded at sea for weeks what do  you, picking up after your talks in Myanmar - are they serious about trying to work with  the regional community on this?

RICHARD MARLES, SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND BORDER  PROTECTION: Well I think that the decision that we saw yesterday from Malaysia,  Indonesia in the meeting with Thailand is very welcome, it is a critical breakthrough in all  of this and hopefully it is the key decision that will literally see thousands of lives saved,  I think it’s important that were not pointing fingers at countries specifically, ultimately  there does need to be a regional solution to ending what is a particularly depraved  journey of people smuggling from Rakhine State and Bangladesh down into the  southern part of South East Asia and particularly Malaysia. We saw that with the  cemeteries that were unearthed a month or so ago just how bad a journey this is and I  think that’s what people need to understand, essentially what’s happened here is  Thailand have broken up this people smuggling route we’ve then seen people stranded  along the journey as it were, people smugglers have behaved utterly appallingly in  respect of their victims and what we needed to get was a regional answer to the  immediate humanitarian concern and I hope that what we’ve seen now with the meeting  yesterday is a critical breakthrough in that.

GILBERT: You’ve been in Myanmar before arriving in Bangkok there now, should that  government be required to do much more in protecting and not persecuting in the very  least the Rohingya community within its population?

MARLES: Look there are obviously steps which the Myanmar Government would be  good if they took in respect of that community and they obviously have a responsibility  in this, there is no question about that. I think that we need to be looking at a regional  solution here and I think that if what comes out of this is that everyone points the finger  solely at Myanmar that’s not going to end up with the kind of results the global  community would want to see and that’s not going to end up in a benefit for those  people who have been stranded on this appalling route. That is not to say that there is  not responsibilities that Myanmar have here, they clearly do and they need to be a part  of the answer here and I think the question now is encouraging Myanmar in participating  in the meeting here in Bangkok next week on the 29th of May but that’s not going to  happen if the global community simply point the finger solely at Myanmar because at  the end of the day this is a regional problem and something like half, the estimates are  rough, but maybe half the people involved in this trip have come from Bangladesh. A lot  of the people who are most vulnerable now are off the coast of Malaysia and Indonesia,  Thailand clearly are in the middle of this as well, it actually requires a solution from all of  those countries.

GILBERT: Ok, we’ve only got a minute left but just quickly the US State Department  has said the US will take a led as part of any UN resettlement procedure should  Australia also put its hand up to take a number of those affect in this crisis?

MARLES: That’s a complicated question Kieran and one that we need to be working  with the UNHCR on and one which comes further down the track, but what we need to  be doing now is supporting the countries of the region to address the immediate  humanitarian crisis and can I say that the comments of Tony Abbott in recent days have  been utterly appalling and have been read very badly in my view in this part of the  world. They have actually denied the political space which was needed yesterday and  will be needed next week to get an answer to this and actually we need a Prime Minister  who stops peddling his three word slogans in a domestic context in a way which causes  significant difficulty for the countries of the region and in an international context.

There simply has to be a point at which Tony Abbott understands that he is not just a  low rent domestic politician but is the Prime Minister of Australia. He enters the world  stage as a statesman or at least he should and that’s what we need to see and hear  from him.

GILBERT: Shadow Immigration Minister Richard Marles live from Bangkok, thank you  for your time this morning.

MARLES: Thanks Kieran.
