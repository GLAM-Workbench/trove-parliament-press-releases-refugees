INTERVIEWSky NewsAustralian Agenda

ISSUES: Immigration issues, leadership of the Labor Party, Gonski Review into  school funding.

PETER VAN ONSELEN: We’re joined now by the Schools Minister, Peter Garret. Mr  Garrett, thanks for your company.

PETER GARRETT:Thank Peter.

PETER VAN ONSELEN:We’re going to talk about the Gonksi review into education a  little bit later but that begs the first question, which is that with all of this going on - the  High Court, the leadership discussions (at least within the media) about Julia Gillard - how  does the government get the traction that it need to be able to focus on the issues that  matter in a policy sense?

PETER GARRETT:Well, Peter, I don’t agree with Paul’s assessment. We’re not the first  government that’s had the High Court make a ruling which means that you have to go back  and look at your policy settings. It’s happened before, it’s happened in this instance and it  will happen again. And it was an unexpected decision. It’s one that the government  wouldn’t have, necessarily, taken into account as it was planning its policy and we will  work through those issues.

On the broader question of leadership and the like, everybody that I speak to recognises  that we’re going through a difficult spell, and everybody that I speak to is absolutely  committed to us staying the course, and everybody that I speak to is fully supportive of the  Prime Minister.

So will continue to do what we ought to do as Government - argue the case, prosecute the  Opposition and deliver the policies that we think are good for the country.

PETER VAN ONSELEN:The problem though is I remember similar rhetoric ahead of  Kevin Rudd being removed and the situation in the polling and in the sort of public  perception stakes wasn’t as bad then as it is now for Julia Gillard. So, it’s understandable,  isn’t it, that people look at it and say, “Well, this government’s got form for moving one  when somebody gets into hot water”- and Julia Gillard is in more than a little bit of hot  water.

PETER GARRETT:Well I don’t know that a High Court decision that comes down about  the legality or otherwise of decisions that are made in government puts us into hot water.

PETER VAN ONSELEN:But it’s more than that- it’s more than that.

PETER GARRETT:Well, yeah, but you know, I mean the media takes a fevered  approach to these issues. The media is always interested in exacerbating whatever potential  or daily difficulties a Government or an Opposition has. I mean, I’m not going to sit here  and spend a lot of time saying, you know, “I can see all of the inconsistencies in Tony  Abbott and what’s he doing about this, that and the other?” I’ll take my opportunities when  they come. But at the end of the day, we’ve got to get on with the business of delivering  good government and that’s what I’m committed to and that’s what other ministers are as  well.

PAUL KELLY:I think that one of the points minister, though, is that somehow, the  Government’s got to recover. I mean, it’s going to head in one of two ways: it’s going to  sink further in the polls and the crisis will deepen; or, alternatively, it’s got to find some  mechanism to recover and regain lost ground. How can it do that?

PETER GARRETT:Well, Paul, you know, today we make an announcement that there’ll  be paid parental leave for dads. That means that, on Fathers Day, we can say that dads will  have an opportunity to look after their kids, mums will have that opportunity, the kids will  get it as well.

These are good, constructive Labor policies - the kinds of things that we’re doing all the  time and we’ll continue to do them. And I just think, at the same time, we will focus on the  inconsistencies and the negativism that Mr Abbott consistently shows. I mean, there are  very serious questions around Tony Abbott’s economic credibility - his intention or  keenness on whether he actually wants to be serious about economics; the fact that they’ve  got a really significant, $70 billion black-hole sitting there and, as well, that his own back  bench and Shadow Ministry are quite concerned about his performance in that area.

So we’ll continue to prosecute Tony Abbott who only is a negative populist politician and  we’ll deliver constructive good policies for the country and argue them in forums like this  and other good places.

STEVE LEWIS:But, Minister, just on the, back on the asylum seeker policy, do you share  the views of some of your Left-wing colleagues, people like Steven Jones and Doug  Cameron, who are saying now that the Government must embrace on-shore processing?

PETER GARRETT:Look, what I would say is that I think for us now, given the High  Court decision, to have an effective way of dealing with people who are seeking asylum in  this country, we need to have an approach that is orderly, that secures and guarantees the  control of our borders, that is humane and that embodies the protections that already exist  within the legislation and within the convention for refugees. Now, if on-shore processing  fulfils those criteria, and off -shore processing doesn’t fulfil those criteria, as a  consequence of the High Court decision, then a discussion can be undertaken on that basis.

PETER VAN ONSELEN:Minister, let me just build off what Steve just asked and give  some context by showing some footage that we’ve got. First, we’ve got the Minister Chris  Bowen after the announcement by the High Court. Let’s take a look.

CHRIS EVANS: [Video grab]Let’s make no bones about it; today’s decision by the High  Court is a profoundly disappointing one. Disappointing to the Government, disappointing  to me. It is a significant blow to our efforts to break the people smugglers’ business model.

PETER VAN ONSELEN:Now, Steve was making the point that Doug Cameron and  others were interested in a return to on-shore processing. Now, Doug Cameron is a pretty  prominent member of the Labor Left, he made those comments on radio during the week.  Let’s take a look.

DOUG CAMERON: [Audio grab]The position that’s beginning to solidify in the left of  the party is that the national platform should be implemented and the national platform is a  document that says asylum seekers should be processed on-shore.

PETER VAN ONSELEN:So, on-shore processing. That is something that you think the  Left will get its way within the party and there may now be a realisation that, if you like,  good Labor values embrace that, rather than constantly looking for off-shore solutions?

PETER GARRETT:Well, Peter, let’s wait and see what the release of the Solicitor-General’s advice is that the Prime Minister has asked for. And that will happen, I think,  fairly soon- I understand that Minister Bowen will have more to say about these issues this  morning. Look, the High Court, not withstanding what Paul has said, has made a fairly

clear decision, and it’s one that was by the majority of the court. And now Tony Abbott  might think he can run out and secure a Nauru Pacific Solution on the back of that- I’m not  so sure. Let us see what that advice says and obviously the Government will consider the  views of its Caucus.

PETER VAN ONSELEN:Are you personally just a little bit happy about the High Court  result? I mean, I know it was considered to be a body blow to the Government, but you  have been a human rights and environmental activist for most of your life. You couldn’t

Page 3 of 8 Minister Garrett - Transcript of Interview Sky News, Australi...

4/11/2011 http://ministers.deewr.gov.au/garrett/minister-garrett-transcrip...

have been too impressed by the idea of shipping people off the Malaysia. If this judgement  creates a legal precedent where there’s going to be a more humane approach, you’re not  going to be disappointed about that, surely.

PETER GARRETT:Well, Peter, I know you want me to take the invitation and, sort of,  head off into those areas of speculation or personal reflection. I’ve always supported the  Government’s position, but I think the fact is that the court has made a fairly significant  decision which raises uncertainties about whether or not those approaches are going to be  feasible in the future. Let’s see what the advice says, let’s see how the discussion unfolds.  It’s a decision for the Government and for the Immigration Minister.

PAUL KELLY:Just going back to the leadership for the moment. In the Caucus, of  course, there’s a former Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd. The polls indicate that he is far more  popular than Julia Gillard at the moment. Don’t you think at some stage this term the  Caucus has got to have a hard look at the prospect of putting Kevin Rudd back in the job?

PETER GARRETT:Paul, I don’t. I think that the Prime Minister has the support of the  Caucus and the ministry. And even if you’re going through a difficult period, the right  thing for a political party to do is to recognise that it has to focus on the job at hand. We  are supporting Julia Gillard absolutely and we have every expectation that the sorts of  things that we’ve been working hard on- the National Broadband Network, health reform,  the sorts of things in education we might talk about in a tick, are thing which people in  time will recognise as having made a real difference to this country. They’re good things  and I think we can be judged by them.

STEVE LEWIS:Minister, do you not accept that that the reality is that in the wake of the  High Court decision, and particularly in terms of her response, there was a collapse in  support for the Prime Minister, particularly within the Left? I mean, I spoke to a number of

your colleagues and it was quite clear that particularly the Left, there was view that was  hardening that Ms Gillard was no longer tenable as Prime Minister and it’s a matter of time  before she is removed as Prime Minister. Do you not accept that?

PETER GARRETT:No, I don’t accept it all Steve and I think we’re at one of those  periods where for this political party, its key mission and its agenda are delivering policies  that are good for this country now and in the future. That is something which we need to  focus on, that’s what we ought to be talking about and that’s what I’m considering at all  times.

PAUL KELLY:Okay, if we just shift to your portfolio, if we just shift to the schools  issue. You’ve got this major review of school funding coming up at the end of the year. Do  you rule out that this will lead to a change in the funding shares between private and  government schools and if we project ahead in terms of growth, what we’ll see is a shift in  the balance of growth funding from private to government schools?

4/11/2011 http://ministers.deewr.gov.au/garrett/minister-garrett-transcrip...

PETER GARRETT:Well, Paul, I think the absolutely right way to answer that is that I  don’t intend to pre-empt what the Gonski panel might bring forward. Look, this is a huge  piece of work; it’s the first time that we’ve had a go at it in, what, around thirty years? And  it comes on the back of big, significant reforms that this government has delivered on  education generally. Both transparency, supporting low S.E.S schools, improving teacher  quality and the like. There was a broad consensus that the funding model itself needs to be  looked at - and that’s from both non-government and government sectors. And it’s true  that, for example, some of the reports have shown that the linkage between funding and,  say, issues such as student equality, are not clear. And there are many other things there for  the panel to chew on, but I’m not going to pre-empt what they’ll find.

What we’ve said is that no school will loose a single dollar per student; we’ve also said  that the Gonski review can provide advice as to transitional arrangements, depending on  what recommendations they make the Government.

PAUL KELLY:But how do you get round this problem, I mean I know you’ve said this  debate is not about the old questions of state aid, its not about government versus private  schools but the truth is it is, surely. And this is the way it’s been presented by all sorts of  interest groups. How do you get round that problem?

PETER GARRETT:Well I don’t actually think it is and I mean, I know there’s a bit of  confection that comes around in the Sunday papers and, Chris Pyne will be out there  saying we want to attack the private schools but look, the fact is that you’ve got in some  states between 25, 30, even 35 and higher percentage of kids going to non-government  schools, in other words to private schools, particularly in secondary years. I’ve said clearly  that not only do we respect the choice that parents make but we are not going to get into an  ‘us verses them’ debate, I mean, we’ve been down this road before, it’s counter productive  and the fact is that the non government school sector is participating in this review  constructively as are other stakeholders.

PAUL KELLY:Is that Julia Gillard’s view, that is that the government won’t get involved  in this sort of ‘us versus them’ debate, government versus private debate, is that her view?

PETER GARRETT:Well, well it’s the view of the government, the Prime Minister, the  ministers; it’s certainly my strong view. And, you know what I think? I think that we owe  it to ourselves to have a mature debate about how to get the best, most excellent education  we can for kids around the country and have a system that delivers that, recognising that in  Australia we do have a system which is both a private and a government system.

PAUL KELLY: Well know I’ve looked at one of the discussion papers and it is proposing  that there be conditions on enrolments in private schools. Essentially the argument is that,  one of the difficulties here is that, private schools are allowed to determine their intake of  students and they take the best students. If they’re being funded from government  therefore, there should be conditions imposed on private school enrolment, that they be,  that they have to face up to these conditions, and these conditions would be imposed on  them from government. Is that your disposition?

4/11/2011 http://ministers.deewr.gov.au/garrett/minister-garrett-transcrip...

PETER GARRETT:Again, that’s ah one of the interesting ideas that has come forward.

PAUL KELLY:Well it’s a pretty fundamental idea.

PETER GARRETT:Well and there are quite a few others, there’s proposals for the  feasibility of the student resourcing standard, that’s a pretty interesting idea.

PAUL KELLY:Sure.

PETER GARRETT:It will be up to the panel to consider it. But I do make this point, in  Australia we have invested a lot, particularly in the term of this Labor Government in  education. We are focussing on things like literacy and numeracy. If we compare ourselves  to similar countries overseas we can see that our good students do well but we’ve got a  long tail of students that are not doing as well and we are seeing lessening quality and  standards, for example in things like literacy and numeracy. We need to address that. In  order to address it we need to have a system that is transparent, effective and fair and I’m  looking forward to the Gonski panel giving me recommendations to that end. STEVE  LEWIS: Minister I know you are loathe to talk about the Gonski Review but how do you  in good conscience, as a Labor Minister, how do you accept the fact, and this is all out  there, that schools, some of the rich private schools, are currently sitting on assets of tens  of millions of dollars and under the current model receiving large tracks of Commonwealth  funding. Where is the equality in that and, given what you’ve just said about the long tail  of students with poor literacy and numeracy, surely- surely the only real answer is to  provide a larger share of funding to those poorer schools, be they public or private.

PETER GARRETT:Well, you know Steve, there’s other interesting pieces of work that  have come through with this review. For example, it’s shown that we do not have a direct  line between the funding for a school and the educational outcome, or the connection to  things like disadvantage- and that that happens across systems. So each time we talk about,  “Well look at the private schools over here, you know, they’ve got six football fields, why  should they get more money”, or, “Look at this poor school over here, you know, its got a

lot of kids from non-English speaking backgrounds, surely it needs more money”, the fact  is that our system at the moment is quite complex and you do not see direct linear  relationships between the investment in funds, whether the investments from government  or the investments that parents make in private systems and the educational benefits and  the educational outcomes for students. Let me give you just one more example: we have in  some states very small numbers of kids who are identified as being kids of disadvantage  and therefore they are entitled to receive disability support. In other states, and the amount  that they receive is quite high. In other states we have a much larger cohort of students and  the amount that they receive is much less. What happens for a parent when they take their  kid with a disability from Victoria into Queensland or New South Wales or whatever it is  and suddenly they find themselves completely turned over because there’s no consistency  in our approach to things like disability. We’ve got a lot of work to do here. Incidentally,  we have produced an extra two-hundred-million dollars for those kids in our last budget  but we know there is more that needs to be done.

4/11/2011 http://ministers.deewr.gov.au/garrett/minister-garrett-transcrip...

PETER VAN ONSELEN:Isn’t one of the problems just one of raising expectations  though, for the Government? I mean Julia Gillard said during the week that she doesn’t  like the term “people’s revolt”, she doesn’t like the connotations attached to it, but you’ve  been calling what you’re doing in education an education revolution. When you call it  something as significant as that, when you do make deliveries, those deliveries ultimately  look small compared to the rhetoric of what’s been promised.

PETER GARRETT:Well I think that we can fairly lay claim to having put education  right at the middle of our agenda and done a great deal about it. I mean I for example don’t  accept in any way the nay-saying about the Building the Education Revolution. I think by  the end of this year, by the time that parents and grandparents and carers have gone into  schools around Australia and seen the new assembly halls, seen the new science labs, seen  the new classrooms they’re going to walk away and say, “This was a fantastic investment  by this government”. Now, that was a big investment, it was done for a range of reasons,  but it’s left a legacy in education that touches everybody, every single person in the  country. The same goes for what we’re doing with low S.E.S school investment. I mean  we are investing nearly double the amount that the former government did in education-  it’s a $65 billion spend- over the quadrennium. They are really significant resources that  we’re putting into education and we do it because we know not only is this really, you  know, the right thing to do for kids to get their capacity, but for talking about meeting the  skills issues, the skills shortages, and setting ourselves up for a global economy which is  fast changing, where we need to be nimble and agile and innovative and active. We need to  spend this money and do it the way we’re doing it.

PAUL KELLY:I just want to come back to this question I raised earlier because I think it  really goes to the heart of so much of this debate. To what extent do you accept the  principle, the principle that the Government will have to move in the direction of imposing  more conditions on the way private schools select their students or the way private schools  operate? It seems to me there are going to be more conditions imposed on the private  schools. Do you rule out that direction completely, or do you accept that the Government  will walk down that path to a certain extent?

PETER GARRETT:Well in relation to the example that you gave earlier Paul, and the  example given about say for example, non-Government schools accepting more kids, say  for example with disadvantage or disability. The schools themselves have indicated their  willingness to discuss those issues depending on what the funding model or arrangements  might be, and it’s up to Mr Gonski and his panel to consider the submissions that come  from this review. I mean remember, we’ve now go four really important pieces of work  out there I mean I called them barbeque stoppers -

PAUL KELLY:Sure, sure sure -

PETER GARRETT:- They’re dense, but they are barbeque stoppers.

4/11/2011 http://ministers.deewr.gov.au/garrett/minister-garrett-transcrip...

PAUL KELLY:Sure, sure, but I just want to I just want to focus on this point. So what  you are saying is that you would like to see the private schools take more of the  disadvantaged students.

PETER GARRETT:No, what I’m saying is I’ve heard what the private schools have said  about this issue. What I would like everybody to do, private schools and others, are to look  closely at these four pieces of important work; provide the submissions to Mr Gonski’s  panel, Mr Gonski’s panel will chew over that, bring the recommendations back to  Government, we will then consult, and then including within the Government and  externally and then we’ll make our decisions.

PETER VAN ONSELEN:Alright Schools Minister Peter Garrett we appreciate you  joining us on Australian Agenda, hopefully we can have you back once the Gonski report  is tabled and really go through some of those details.

PETER GARRETT:I’d be happy to.

PETER VAN ONSELEN:Brilliant.
