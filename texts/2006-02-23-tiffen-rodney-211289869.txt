Symposium: A Decade of Howard Government

The Geoffrey Boycott of Australian politics

Rodney Tiffen, The University of Sydney

In 1988, at the nadir of his first disastrous period as opposition leader, the  Bulletin presented John Howard with an unwanted Christmas present. The  cover of the issue for 20 December proclaimed ‘Mr 18%. Why on earth  does this man bother?’ The following year when Andrew Peacock deposed  him in a stunning party room coup, Howard’s leadership credentials were in  tatters. Howard himself did not think a return to Liberal Party leadership

was possible, colourfully describing the prospect as amounting to ‘Lazarus  with a triple bypass’ (Bowers 1989).

Six years later, following the failure of a succession of Liberal leaders— Peacock, Hewson and Downer, it was a more chastened and cautious  Howard who again assumed the mantle of Opposition Leader. During the  1980s he had boldly proclaimed that the times suited him, and that he was  the most conservative leader the Liberals had ever had. In the 1987 election,  he had proposed a radical program of cutting government spending and  taxes and, despite the economic pain in the electorate at the time, he lost.

By contrast, Howard’s main aim in the lead up to the 1996 election was to  preach reassurance. No electorally dangerous spending cuts were  canvassed. There would never ever be a GST. Medicare would be retained  and strengthened, and so forth. In light of later debates about Labor  opposition strategies, it should be remembered that in 1996 Howard won  with a classic ‘small target’ campaign. Of course he had the key element to  make that tactic successful—an irretrievably unpopular government and  prime minister.

Even after his huge victory in 1996, Howard  arguably lacked the authority usually associated  with an electorally successful prime minister. In  1998, the swing against Howard was one of the  strongest ever against a government in its first  attempt at re-election. Labor actually won a  majority of the two-party preferred vote, and t Government was only saved by its success at hanging on to the marginal  seats it had won in 1996. In early 2001, pundits had all but universally  written him off, after a series of electoral defeats and consistently disastrous  showings in the polls. Even in the year leading up the 2004 election, under  Latham’s leadership, Labor led for much of the time, and the major parties  stood broadly equal when the election was called.

he

Howard’s main aim in  the lead up to the 1996  election was to preach  eassurance. r

In sum, we should not over-simplify the electoral record as one of  continuing triumphs. At times his position has been extremely vulnerable  and his political survival has hung by a thread.

On the other hand, Howard stands alongside prime ministers Hawke (1983- 91) and Menzies (1949-66) as the only leaders to have won four successive  elections, and is now the second longest-serving Australian Prime Minister.  The last two elections have—against the trend of Australian elections— seen a swing towards, rather than away from, the incumbent government. In

2001, he staged one of the most, if not the most, amazing electoral  turnarounds ever, coming from a seemingly hopeless position early in the  year to record a resounding victory (Gittins 2001). In 2004, he became the  first Australian prime minister since 1977 to win a majority in both Houses.

Nevertheless in the pantheon of Australia’s most electorally successful  leaders, Howard does seem a strange fit alongside Menzies and Hawke. He  does not have their personal charisma. Moreover, although in retrospect it is  easy to downplay the degree of contention during the reigns of successful  leaders, in key respects Howard’s political agenda and outlook are less  clearly in conformity with majority Australian public opinion than one  would expect given his long tenure.

This combination of facts raises two issues—one is how the Government’s  electoral success relates to the constellation of public opinion. The other is  how Howard’s media management skills relate to his success. This paper  argues that Howard has been masterful in framing the perception of  electoral choices and influencing the political agenda, and that an  underestimated source of his political success has been his skill at defensive  spin control.

THE CONSTELLATION OF OPINION AND AGENDA  MANAGEMENT

To simplify (and perhaps somewhat distort) a mass of complex and  inconsistent data into a capsule description, Howard does not command  majority support for such major planks of his domestic policies as the GST,  Workplace Relations, stripping back the public sector, privatising Telstra,  and supporting the monarchy. If there is this disjunction between Howard’s  view of society and majority public opinion, how then do we explain his  continuing electoral success?

All governments face occasions when they are  out of step with majority opinion on particular  issues, especially because public opinion is  itself shifting and inconsistent. Successful  governments are typically able to insulate  themselves from the electoral impact of  particular unpopular policies in several ways.

An election is not a referendum on a set of issues but a judgement about  competitors’ capacity to govern. An election, then, is a more general battle  of images than just choosing among a set of policy positions. In a  representative democracy, it is less important that a party’s position aligns

with a voter’s on some particular policy viewpoint—especially if it has only  transient public salience—than the sense that the voters think the party and  its leader are competent, predictable, and have the range of abilities to deal  with coming contingencies. Governments have an advantage in this contest  of images because they are more of a known commodity, and it is easier to  associate the opposition with the risk of change.

Similarly, electoral politics is about relative not absolute choices. For many  in the electorate their choice represents what they see as the lesser of two  evils rather than a positive and hopeful embrace of the party they are voting  for. So how choices are framed and, in particular, how one side is able to  portray the other are crucial to success.

Howard has pinpointed the marketing weaknesses of his opponents,  focusing upon Beazley’s ‘lack of ticker’ and Latham’s inexperience. Both  parties prefer not just to rest on the appeals of their own policies, but to  contrast them to the alleged disaster their opponents represent. The 2004  election campaign—despite his several mis-steps and lapses—showed  Howard’s strategic strength. As far as possible, he stayed on message—the  virtue of the Government’s economic management and the fear of higher  interest rates under Labor. Howard showed similar mastery in the conduct  of the republican referendum. The process maximised the No vote against  ‘the politicians’ republic’, by combining both those who wanted to retain  the monarchy with those who wanted a popular vote for president.

In projecting himself, Howard has constructed a consistent persona, as a  traditional Australian identity, someone who is at one with the ‘average’  Australian, and he takes every opportunity to highlight this. Note, for  example, his recent staunch defence of Christmas—and the way the media  lapped it up. Queensland’s Sunday Mail had a headline, filling half its front  page on 18 December 2005: ‘Stop the Rot / Howard in call to save  Christmas’ ‘Prime Minister John Howard has called for religion to be put  back into Christmas’. What concerned the Prime Minister—and brought  this front page headline—was the lack of ‘nativity scenes in department  stores. They seem to have disappeared in recent years and you have this sort  of “oh we don’t want to offend anybody”’. It is very characteristic of

Howard that he blames multi-culturalism and political correctness rather  than crass commercialism, and the religious expression he wanted to re-introduce was very undemanding—a matter of decorations rather than, for  example, giving money to charities for the poor.

Even though few under 70 are likely to embrace  most of Howard’s world view, it is one that  does not challenge or threaten many. Labor  frontbencher Julia Gillard described Howard as  ‘the political equivalent of white bread: not very  nice or nutritious but you know the next loaf is  going to be the same as the one you bought last  week, and the same as the one you’ll buy in a fortnight’s time’ (Gibson &  Dick 2006). People may not be excited by white bread, but nor are they  alarmed by it.

In an election campaign not all issues are equally important. As always the

People may not be  excited by white bread,  but nor are they  larmed by it. a

party contest is partly one of the relative salience of different issues, what  issues count most with the public at the time they vote. Although the  Howard Government is out of step with majority opinion in many of its  attempts at domestic political engineering, in other areas it enjoys majority  approval—especially in its record of economic management, where it has  overseen continuing growth, low inflation, lower unemployment and low  interest rates. Probably just as important, the Government has been helped  by the rise of a sense of threat, from asylum seekers and then from  terrorism. The Government has an interest in maintaining the public focus  on these issues rather than the domestic agenda.

The attempt to escalate them was most evident in the low road that Howard  took to victory in the 2001 election, the Tampa, children overboard, and the  fusing of the asylum seeker issue with the terrorist threat. The Immigration  Minister, Phillip Ruddock, ‘did whatever he could to create a sense of  panic. In one extraordinary statement he warned—on the basis of  information from an unnamed source—that ‘whole villages’ in the Middle  East were ‘packing up’ for the journey to Australia. ‘If it was a national  emergency several weeks ago,’ he added, ‘it’s gone up something like 10  points on the Richter scale since then’ (Browne 2005).

The contrasting agendas were nicely juxtaposed in November 2005. Two  pieces of legislation were dominating the week in parliament, and the polls  showed a neat symmetry between them—on industrial relations, 29 per cent  were satisfied and 60 per cent dissatisfied with Howard’s performance  while on terrorism, 62 per cent were satisfied and 30 per cent dissatisfied  (Hartcher 2005b).

At midday on Wednesday, just before the scheduled introduction of this  momentous legislation, Prime Minister Howard called a midday press  conference, in which he said that intelligence just received revealed a  serious terrorist threat. As a result, the existing legislation (already in  operation) would need urgent amendment. The Prime Minister was not  asked a question about industrial relations (Hartcher 2005a, 2005b), and in  all subsequent media coverage terrorism trumped workplace relations. The  issue where the government enjoyed majority popular support displaced the  one where it was unpopular. Whatever the substantial reasons behind the  Government’s actions, it is hard to believe the Prime Minister was unaware  of the publicity advantages of his move.

So, especially at moments of electoral choice,  the Government’s preferred issues have been  most salient on the public’s agenda, and the  Prime Minister has managed to project both his  preferred self-image and his preferred image of  his opponents fairly consistently. Partly this  comes down to media management skills, and it  is to these that we now turn.

HOWARD’S DEFENSIVE SPIN

The popular and scholarly attention to spin control, public relations and  politicians’ tactics for manipulating the media is misleadingly lop-sided.

Howard has a muted  style—almost a one-tone-fits-all sobriety of  esponse. r

There is concentration upon charismatic and inspiring leaders such as John  Kennedy and Bill Clinton. There is concentration on the mixing of politics  and celebrity and the telegenic qualities that make for political success.  There is dissection of immediate tactics such as the manufacture of photo

opportunities and sound bites, and the timing and framing of news releases.  However, there is much less attention to the strategies and skills of  defensive spin, and it is here that Howard excels.

The overall aim of politicians’ attempts at news management is to maximise  the attention to and the impact of positive developments and to minimise  that of negative developments. All parties need defensive skills because  they inevitably face embarrassments and reversals, but these skills are  especially relevant to governments seeking to remain in office.

Some of Australia’s most flamboyant and otherwise skilful politicians have  not been good at defensive skills, often through being too aggressive, never  willing to concede a point and so increasing rather than decreasing attention  to the damaging actions. Treasurer Keating’s description of the recession  we had to have is perhaps the epitome of a response that inflames rather  than mollifies the critics. Another example was Attorney-General Gareth  Evans. When he was in trouble for authorising spy flights over Tasmania to  ensure the Franklin was not being dammed, he invoked what he called ‘the

streaker’s defence’ that it seemed like a good idea at the time, thus  increasing rather than reducing media coverage. Such counter-productive  invocations by John Howard are difficult to find. Even in apparent triumph  he has a muted style—almost a one-tone-fits-all sobriety of response—that  means also there is little triumphalism in success that may later become a  hostage to fortune. The repertoire of defensive skills is extensive but some  of the key ones follow.

Altering the timing

The Government has been masterful at ensuring that negative news comes  out at moments of least electoral relevance. The story about children  overboard—surely one of the most shameful episodes in Australian  electoral history—(just) remained intact until the 2001 election, while in  February 2002 it was fairly fully exposed by the Senate, with the  Government receiving intense but temporary adverse publicity, at a time  when it had no electoral impact.

The 2004 election had two examples. Official largesse to marginal  electorates—low on policy rationale, high on pork barreling—were not  systematically exposed at the time. Even eight months later the disclosures  failed to gain much media traction, even though it was disclosed that the  marginal Liberal seat of McEwen received sixteen of 27 special sports  grants in the lead up to the 2004 election and a further six went to another  problematic Liberal seat, Makin, in Adelaide (Schubert 2005). Much more  central to the campaign were the Liberals’ promises about the Medicare  safety net, promises which less than six months later were abandoned.  Nothing had changed since the election to justify the breaking of what was  by any standard a ‘core’ promise. Veteran journalist Michelle Grattan was

moved to comment ‘John Howard has treated the voters with total disdain  in hacking into the safety net. He has absolutely no excuse for breaking an

election promise that was repeated over and over, and formed a central part  of his campaign’ (2005a). Again the government suffered intense adverse  publicity but at a time of no electoral relevance.

Split the headlines

The breaking of the safety net promise  illustrated another technique. Howard made five  large announcements together, getting some  other bad news out of the way, and somewhat  blurring the public focus. So the Sydney  Morning Herald’s headline (Dodson 2005)  ‘Howard unleashes policy whirlwind’ was the best the Government could  have hoped for as it broke a central promise.

Keep the damage inside the beltway

The Government’s post-election embarrassments all got extensive media  coverage, although at a politically opportune time. More important on a  continuing basis is to reduce the coverage of a negative story by reducing  its newsworthiness, so only the quality media will cover it. Several abuses  of process, for example, are judged too boring for commercial television  and tabloid newspapers.

After gaining the Senate majority in July 2005, Howard’s public posture  was one of modesty, with promises not to abuse the power. When Senator  McGauran ‘gave the finger’ to opposition fingers, the Prime Minister  rebuked him (but had forgiven him by the time he defected from the  Nationals to the Liberals the following January). However, the next six  months included what columnist Glenn Milne called ‘the worst trashing of  the Senate I’ve witnessed in 20 years of covering federal politics’. Often  senators were only given large and complex pieces of legislation just before  they were to be debated, with the government using its numbers to rush  through what it wanted’. The Senate gag has been used more often since  July 1 than it was in the first nine years of the Howard Government: 10  times against nine times’ (Milne 2005).

According to Michelle Grattan (2005b) the Government was not worried  that its rushing legislation through the Senate would get any public traction:  ‘In the Washington phrase the Government likes to use when distinguishing  between “elite” and “punter” views—it’s mostly those “inside the beltway”  who are worried. The Government can be pretty confident that while the  critics will be noisy, suburbia won’t be swayed’.

Howard has a keen sense of how to prevent a potential embarrassment from  becoming a damaging headline. In February 2005 the Government was  under attack on two issues. One was that in the lead up to the election it had  given a $660,000 grant to the Beaudesert Rail Association, in a Queensland  marginal seat, even though it ‘was crippled by debt and trading while  insolvent’ (Price 2005). The other was the admission on Four Corners by  senior Government scientist Rod Barton that he had personally interrogated  prisoners while in Iraq. This directly contradicted Government claims that  no Australians had been involved in interrogations. On February 15, the

overage. c

Opposition directed nine questions at the Prime Minister, four on Iraq and  five on the improper Queensland grant. Howard managed not to give a  substantial answer to any of them’ (Price 2005). By the end of the  interrogation, Howard was struggling to repress a giggle as non-answer  followed non-answer’. To those few viewing Question Time on television,  and to the press gallery, his evasions looked ridiculous. However he  achieved his aim of keeping his responses and hence the issues off the front  pages and the television news. Only columnist Matt Price (2005) directly  commented on his evasions.

Stonewalling

The Prime Minister’s stonewalling during this  Question Time was only one example of a m more general strategy. This strategy is based o the view that once there are no fresh  developments to feed a negative story, news  attention will pass on, and the critics’ charges  will run out of steam.

uch  n

The Government’s adoption of this strategy is most clearly seen in the  matter of ministerial resignations. In the first eighteen months of the  Howard Government, after he had proudly proclaimed his Ministerial Code

of Conduct, more ministers (five) resigned due to scandals than in any  previous Australian government (Tiffen 1999, p. 164). Since then not one  Minister has resigned. Whatever the immediate heat of the controversy, the  Prime Minister has clearly decided there will be no scalps, and no  admissions of major wrong doing. The Palmer Report, which followed the  disclosures of the treatment of Cornelia Rau and Vivian Alvarez, said it had  200 cases of mistreatment referred to it, and included trenchant criticism of  the culture in the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. The  Government, however, did not hold the Minister for Immigration  responsible and require his resignation.

Controlling the pace and tone of an interview

The Prime Minister has become increasingly effective when being  interviewed about a difficult subject. He is the master of ponderous prose,  blunting the sharpness of a charge with the tone and length of his response.  The resulting circumlocutions probably do not win him any converts, but  are often effective at damage limitation. For example, when 7.30 Report  presenter Kerry O’Brien was quizzing him (Australian Broadcasting  Corporation 2005) about what he had learnt following the furore over the  appointment of Robert Gerard to the Reserve Bank Board, he began by  saying ‘I guess in political life it’s always wrong to say you haven’t learnt  anything …’ before going into a long rambling talk about procedures in  appointments. In effect his answer amounted to ‘no’, and no admission of  any weaknesses, but there was no sense of aggression or arrogance in the  way he defused the direct question.

Note how Howard has handled the lack of any evidence of weapons of mass  destruction in Iraq, despite the frequent, vociferous and certain claims about  their existence by government ministers before the invasion. Three months

after the invasion, on 11 June 2003, he was interviewed by Tony Jones on  ABC TV’s Lateline:

Q: Does it matter if no weapons of mass destruction are found?

JH: Oh I wouldn’t say it doesn’t matter. I wouldn’t say that at all. And it’s  too early to make a judgement. I mean, people should be more patient.

Q: … If none are found what are the implications?

JH: I think, Tony, that question should be asked and I’d be very happy to  answer it if, after the elapse of a reasonable amount of time, such a  conclusion is reached. But it’s too early, there are too many sensitive sites,  the international team of 1,300 or 1,400 is only now being assembled. It is  altogether too early for people to say, well there definitely haven’t been and  won’t be any evidence found that Iraq had a WMD capacity before the war  started. Those are issues that obviously I’ll be asked about, if those things  happen …

Almost a year later in an interview with  Channel Seven’s Chris Reason on Sunday  Sunrise (Channel Seven 2004), ‘a reasonable  amount of time’ had apparently still not elapsed.

Q: Is it time to admit there were no stockpiles of

Nevertheless five  months later, John Howard could still say ‘The work of the Iraq Survey  Group will go on for some time. I am not going to put a limit on it’  (Channel Seven 2004).

Prime Minister was pushed further by two reporters who asked in separate  interviews whether he would have supported war knowing Iraq’s capability in weapons of mass destruction was negligible’.

The technique was seen most graphically in th release of the Jull Report, a bipartisan parliamentary committee inquiring  into the pre-war intelligence regarding Iraqi WMD (Parliamentary Joint  Committee on ASIO 2004). The report was released on 1 March 2004, but the Government started preparing the ground with a mid-February leak to Tom Allard of the Sydney Morning Herald. It seems that missing from the  text that Allard saw was the critical section on the way the Government had used the intelligence available to it. Allard (2004) wrote ‘there appeared to  be no systematic doctoring of intelligence by Australia’s political leaders  before the Iraq war’. However he adds the ‘intelligence services do not get  off so lightly’. The same day as Allard’s story, according to Peter Browne a ‘much less nuanced account’ went out through the news agency AAP,  under the headline ‘Iraq report expected to clear Government’.
