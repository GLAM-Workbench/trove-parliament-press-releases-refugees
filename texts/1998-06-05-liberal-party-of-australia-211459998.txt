SITUATION IN KOSOVO

Â

The Australian Government is gravely concerned at 
reports of a serious escalation of the conflict in Kosovo over the past 
week.

Â

It is clear that the situation has deteriorated and 
we are very concerned at reports of a number of casualties and large 
numbers of refugees crossing the border into Albania.

Â

I call on the government of Federal Republic of Yugoslavia 
to take immediate action to achieve a peaceful resolution of the conflict 
and to stop the threat of violence.

Â

These events show that finding a settlement to the 
conflict in Kosovo becomes more urgent every day if the international 
community is to avoid a repeat of the tragedy that occurred in Bosnia.

Â

The escalation in fighting increases the onus on both 
sides to reach a political settlement through direct dialogue. I hope 
that it will be possible for another round of talks between the government 
of Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Kosovar Albanians to be scheduled 
in the near future and that it is able to make progress toward that 
end.

Â

Australia calls for a political solution which provides 
an enhanced status for Kosovo in Yugoslavia and protects the human rights 
of all the people of Kosovo.
