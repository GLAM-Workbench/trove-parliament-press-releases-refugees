Australia provides $350,000 for the Anti-Piracy Arrangement in Thailand

Australia will contribute $3 50,000 to the United Nations High  Commissioner for Refugees' Anti-Piracy Arrangement in Thailand, the  Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Gareth Evans, announced  today.

The funds will be used for anti-piracy activities in the Gulf of  Thailand, including sea and air patrols, public awareness campaigns,  direct police-public contact at port and village levels and more  sophisticated tracing systems for boat owners.

Australia has been a major contributor to the Anti-Piracy Arrangement  program since its inception in 1982. The current contribution brings  total Australian support to $ 2 .476m . , ’

"The success of the program has greatly reduced the number of attacks  by pirates," Senator Evans said.

"However, the attacks that are occurring are more violent."

"It appears that only a small number of pirates are responsible and  greater emphasis is therefore being placed on land-based activities in  an attempt to trace the boats involved."

Australian assistance to the Anti-Piracy Arrangement forms part of  the Government's overseas aid program administered by the Australian  International Development Assistance Bureau (AIDAB).
