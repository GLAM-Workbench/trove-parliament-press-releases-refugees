PRIME MINISTER  CHANGES TO THE MINISTRY



Today I announce changes to the Cabinet and Ministry that I will recommend  to Her Excellency the Governor-General.

I have put together a team that will best equip my Government to pursue our  priorities for the nation.

Cabinet changes  Bob Carr will join the Senate, and will take on the role of Minister for Foreign  Affairs. Until he takes his place in the Senate, Craig Emerson will continue to  act as Minister for Foreign Affairs.

Craig Emerson will also take on an expanded role of Minister for Trade and  Competitiveness, paying particular attention to increasing Australia’s  international economic competitiveness, with a focus on the Australia in the  Asian Century White Paper.

Brendan O’Connor moves into Cabinet to take the position of Minister for  Small Business, as well as Minister for Housing and Homelessness. Small  businesses are central to Australia’s economy and deserve Cabinet-level  representation.

Attorney-General Nicola Roxon will take on the additional portfolio of  Emergency Management, which as I have made clear I believe must be a  Cabinet-level appointment.

Tony Burke will take on the additional role of Vice-President of the Executive  Council.

Ministry changes  Kate Lundy is promoted to Minister for Sport and Minister for Multicultural  Affairs, as well as Minister Assisting for Industry and Innovation.

David Bradbury is promoted to the Ministry as Assistant Treasurer, and in the  newly-created position of Minister Assisting for Deregulation.

Jason Clare will take on the additional portfolio of Minister for Defence  Materiel.

Kim Carr will move to the crucial services delivery portfolio of Human  Services. Minister Greg Combet will continue to be responsible for  manufacturing at a Cabinet level.

I wish to thank Robert McClelland for his many years of service in the  Ministry.

I am also announcing a number of changes to Parliamentary Secretary  responsibilities.

Parliamentary Secretary changes  Jan McLucas will become Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister in  addition to her existing duties, and Richard Marles will assume wider  responsibilities with the additional title of Parliamentary Secretary for Foreign  Affairs.

Bernie Ripoll becomes Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, while  Sharon Bird becomes Parliamentary Secretary for Higher Education and  Skills.

Jacinta Collins will become Manager of Government Business in the Senate  following Mark Arbib’s retirement.

I want to thank all Ministers who have served the Government so well in their  current portfolios.

I will recommend to Her Excellency the Governor-General that the new  Ministry be sworn in on Monday 5 March 2012.
