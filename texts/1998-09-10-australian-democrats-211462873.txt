‘Why One Nation is Wrong’ booklet released 
to mark anniversary of Hanson’s first speech

Â

The Democrats have released a booklet of official statistics on  
race and multicultural issues to mark the second anniversary of the 
Member for Oxley’s first speech in Parliament.

Â

Democrats Senator for Queensland, Senator John Woodley, said the booklet, 
titled ‘Why One Nation is Wrong’ was an updated version of the highly 
successful ‘Why Pauline Is Wrong’, issued two years ago.

Â

“When the Member for Oxley made her first speech 
in parliament on 10 September 1996, a raft of inaccurate claims about 
race and immigration were read into Hansard and became fodder for the 
race debate,” Senator Woodley said.

Â

“The Democrats responded with a booklet compiling 
the official statistics on the claims Ms Hanson made.

Â

“The release of ‘Why One Nation is Wrong’ marks the anniversary 
of that first speech but it also marks the anniversary of two years 
of Democrats’ work to undo the damage that speech has done.”

Â

Senator Woodley said the Democrats had been deluged 
with requests for the first booklet with thousands distributed around 
Australia. “Yesterday I had a request from a teacher for 500 of the 
new booklets,” he said.

Â

“I stress that these booklets are compilations of the official statistics 
which are available on the public record to anyone who looks,” he 
said.

Â

Senator Woodley said the first booklet was produced 
after requests from high school teachers whose students were discussing 
issues raised by One Nation.

Â

“The booklets were initially designed for teachers 
to have the facts on hand during class discussions on race and multi-cultural 
issues.

Â

“I hope that the release of the new ‘Why One Nation is Wrong’ 
booklet will be a handy resource for journalists and commentators and 
for the public during and after the election campaign.”

Why 'One Nation 'Is Wrong

Â

Tackling 'One Nation's' claims head-on.

Â

September 1998

Â

(Kit prepared by Senator John Woodley for the 1998 Federal Election)

Â

When the Member for Oxley made her first speech in pa rliament 
on 10 September 1996, many inaccurate claims about race and multicultural 
issues were read into Hansard and became fodder for the ensuing race 
debate. The Democrats responded by putting the facts straight on many 
of the claims Pauline Hanson made in that first speech. We prepared 
the   "Why 
Pauline is Wrong” booklet   after school teachers asked us for the facts behind the claims 
she made. Thousands of kits were requested by schools and universities 
around Australia.

Â

Two years later, the Democrats are releasing an updated 
version of our booklet, titled ‘Why   One Nation is Wrong'.  This second booklet, released on 10 
September 1998, marks the second anniversary of the Member for Oxley's 
first speech but it also marks two years of work by the Democrats to 
put the record straight during the debate on race and immigration. We 
updated the booklet and changed the name because One Nation members 
are now present in the Queensland Parliament and running for Federal 
Parliament, on platforms that threaten the very fabric of Australian 
society.

Â

‘Why One Nation is Wrong’  a collection of statistics taken 
from the official public record. This information is available to anyone 
seeking it; the Democrats have merely collated the information. We think 
it's important during debates on race, multicultural and other social 
issues, that the facts are used as a starting point. This booklet covers 
indigenous and immigration issues - what the statistics really are, who 
lives in Australia and what conditions are like for many recent immigrants. 
It also reveals some interesting facts about single mothers - another 
target of 'One Nation'. And it tackles the issue of gun control.

Â

Thank you for taking the time to look at   'Why One Nation Is Wrong' . If you would like any more information 
on these issues, please feel free to contact my office. The more Australians 
with the facts to hand, the better.

Â

Health and life expectancy

Â

Poverty and poor health are prevalent among Aboriginal communities, 
making Aborigines sig nificantly disadvantaged. Indigenous people 
do not have equal access to many mainstream health services and have 
specific health needs that require targeted programs.

Â

Life expectancy

Â

1Â Aboriginal people can expect to die 15 to 20 years earlier than other s;

Â

2Â For Aboriginal 
people aged 25 to 44, the risk of death is 6 times greater than the 
national average;

Â

3Â Aboriginal children are 4 times more likely to die before their first 
birthday.

Â

Disease

Â

1Â Death rates are 
higher for Indigenous people than for  other Australians for almost 
every cause of death;

Â

2Â Indigenous people 
are more likely than others to die from diabetes, cancer, heart and 
infectious diseases;

Â

3Â In some communities, 
diabetes affects a third of the population - 4 times the non-Indigenous  
rate.

Â

Health Services

Â

1Â The hospital 
admission rate for Aboriginal people is 50% higher than for others;

Â

2Â Many Indigenous 
people live in remote areas with limited access to GP, pharmacy, hospital 
and specialist services;

Â

3Â Untargeted health 
spending  often does not get to Indigenous communities. For every 
Medicare dollar accessed by non-Indigenous Australians. Indigenous people 
claim only 27 cents.

Â

'One Nation' does not understand the health inequalities experienced 
by Indigenous people. It hasn't got  the facts, and it hasn't 
got the solutions.

Â

One Nation Says :

Â

“I am fed up to the back teeth the inequalities 
that are being promoted by the Government and paid for by the taxpayer 
under the assumption that Aboriginals are the most disadvantaged people 
i  n Australia”

Â

(Pauline Hanson MP, Maiden Speech, 10 September 1996)

Â

She is wrong!

Â

Employment and income

Â

While Australia's unemployment rate is of concern to everyone, it 
should be remembered that opportunities for Indigenous people are scarcer 
and inco me levels are often drastically lower than for the community 
as a whole. Of course, in rural and remote areas, gaining work has added 
difficulties.

Â

Unemployment

Â

1Â The unemployment 
rate is 38% for Aborigines, compared with 8.3%* for the general population .

Â

Benefits

Â

1Â jobless Aboriginal 
people and Torres Strait Islanders, if they register with the Department 
of Social Security, receive the same allowance or benefit rates as other 
unemployed people;

Â

2Â Many Aboriginal 
people work for unemployment benefits  through Community Development 
Employment Program schemes, often accepting less than the benefits;

Â

3Â Those working 
on CDEP schemes are not eligible for rent assistance or other concessions 
normally associated with unemployment benefits.

Â

Incomes

Â

1Â 15% of  
Aborigines are employed in professional, semi- professional or administrative 
work, as compared to 32% of non-Indigenous people;

Â

2Â The average income for Aborigines is only 65% of that of the general 
population;

Â

3Â 64% of Aborigines 
are on incomes less th an $12,000, Â compared to 45% of the non-Indigenous 
population;

Â

4Â 2% of Indigenous 
people have an income of more than $35,000, compared to 11% of the non-Indigenous 
population.

One Nation says:

Â

“Present governments are encouragin  g separatism in Australia 
by providing opportunities, land, moneys and facilities available only 
to Aboriginals.”

Â

(Pauline Hanson MP Maiden Speech 10 September 1996)

Â

She is wrong!

Â

Guns - Control or Conspiracy?

Â

The Federal Government moved to introduce uniform 
gun laws immediately following the appalling tragedy at Port Arthur 
in Tasmania, where 35 people were killed in April 1996, by a lone gun-man 
armed with a variety of semi-automatic weapons.

Â

The Australian Police Ministers Council, comprising membe rs 
from each state of Australia, acted to put in place regulations governing 
the sale and licensing of certain weapons.

Â

Momentum for change had been building throughout the 
1980s following shocking massacres in Hoddle Street and Queen Street 
in Melbourne, and Strathfield in Sydney.

Â

Most of the research and work on developing model uniform gun laws 
had therefore been done long before the massacre occurred at Port Arthur.

Â

These gun laws were introduced by each State after consideration by 
their own Parliaments.

Â

A compensation scheme  was introduced by the Federal Government 
to recompense owners of guns which became illegal under the new laws.Â  
A total of 643,600 guns (mainly automatic and semi-automatic) were bought 
back under this scheme at a cost of $316 million.

Â

‘One Nation’ claims that legitimate attempts at 
controlling the proliferation of guns in our community is a plot to 
“disarm” the country, and a conspiracy to render its population 
defenceless.

Â

There is no right to bear arms in Australia, nor has there ever been.

Â

The regul ations do not prevent any legitimate applicant from 
being granted a licence to own and operate a gun - in the same way that 
cars are licensed, and alcohol sales regulated.

Â

One Nation's attitude towards citizens bearing arms 
demonstrates their lack of respect for our armed forces, and shows they 
have little confidence in the effectiveness of our police forces.

Â

One Nation says:

Â

“…Port Arthur had nothing to do with it. That was only the excuse 
to slug Australians with extremist laws long hidden away in the files.”

Â

“Howard and his mates condemned hundreds of thousands of Australians 
as potential murderers.”

Â

(Jeff Knuth MP, First 
Speech to Queensland Parliament July 30 1998)

Â

Education - school and tertiary

Â

Education is an institution many of us accept as a  basic right. 
But to many Aboriginal people, particularly those in remote areas, there 
is little or no access to schooling.

Â

School

Â

1Â 33% of Aboriginal 
and Torres Strait Islander children complete Year 12 compared to the 
national average of 77%;

Â

2Â 9% of  
Indigenous youths will not attend or will leave school before the age 
of 14, compared to 2% of non-Indigenous youths;

Â

3Â In 1994, 49% 
of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Â 15 to 19 year olds attended 
school, compared with 90% of other youth;

Â

4Â 5. 1 %  
of Indigenous people did not go to school compared to 0.9% of the non-Indigenous 
population.

Â

Tertiary

Â

1Â Universities 
offer special programs for people who have suffered long-term educational 
disadvantage due to poverty, disability or severe medical condi tions;

Â

2Â Only 2.2% of 
Indigenous people have tertiary degrees, compared with 12.8% of all 
Australians;

Â

3Â Only 0.8% of 
the Indigenous population over 15 years old is educated to the level 
of degree or higher, compared with 7.7% of non-Aboriginal people.

Â

Benefits

Â

1Â Aboriginal students 
can qualify for ABSTUDY instead of Â AUSTUDY assistance. There is little 
difference between the two and ABSTUDY is also means tested;

Â

2Â In 1995, about 
50,000 Indigenous students received help under the Aboriginal Tutorial 
As sistance Scheme.

Â

One Nation says:

Â

“It is abundantly clear that a great chasm 
exists between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal access to education assistance. 
Why the financial burdens and hardships on families of comparable incomes 
differ due to ‘Aboriginali  ty’ is a mystery.”

Â

(“Research” paper from Pauline Hanson MP June 
1996)

Â

Crime and punishment

Â

The Royal Commission into Black Deaths in Custody handed down its 
findings in 1991, but there remain major criticisms of how the Aboriginal 
population is treated  by the law enforcement and judicial system.

Â

Deaths in Custody

Â

1Â Aboriginal people 
are 16. 5 times more likely to die in custody than non-Indigenous Australians;

Â

2Â In 1995, Amnesty 
International criticised Australia for its high incidence of Aboriginal  
deaths in custody and high incarceration rates.

Â

Detention

Â

1Â Aborigines are 
more likely to be detained for less serious offences than other people;

Â

2Â More than half 
of the Aboriginal people held in police custody are detained for public 
drunkenness or st reet offences;

Â

3Â A huge outcry 
erupted in early 1997 after a 29-Year-Â old homeless Aboriginal man was 
given a six-week gaol term in Queensland after asking a plain-clothes 
police officer for a cigarette;

Â

4Â Indigenous Australians 
are 17.3 times more likel y to be arrested than other people;

Â

5Â Indigenous Australians 
are 14.7 times more likely to be imprisoned than other people;

Â

6Â Indigenous juveniles 
aged 10 to 17 are 21 times more likely to be in juvenile detention than 
other people of a similar age;

Â

7Â In Western Australia. 
indigenous juve niles aged 10 to 17 are 4 8 times more likely 
to be in juvenile detention;

Â

8Â The number of 
Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders in prison has increased 
by 61 % in the past seven years - almost twice the growth rate of the 
non-Indigenous prison po pulation.

Â

One Nation says:

Â

“Hasluck’s vision was of a single society in which racial emphases 
were rejected and social issues addressed … But, remember, when he 
have his speech he was talking about the privileges white Australians 
were seen to be enjoying over Aboriginals. Today, 41 years later, I 
talk about the exact opposite - the privileges Aboriginals enjoy over 
other Australians.”

Â

(Pauline Hanson MP Maiden Speech 10 September 1996)

Â

What privileges?

Â

Immigration and multiculturalism

Â

Projections bas ed on current migration and growth patterns 
over the next 30 years show the Asian-born population of Australia will 
be about 7.5%.

Â

Immigration

Â

1Â 23% of Australians 
were born overseas (4.8% of Asian origin). The largest percentage of 
overseas born citizen s (13.4%) come from the UK;

Â

2Â In 1994/95, of 
82,500 migrants, most came from New Zealand (12.4%), the UK (11.4%) 
and China (11.3%);

Â

3Â To say there 
is an 'Asian' culture and religion is overly simplistic. There are many 
Asian cultures and religions, just  as there are many cultures 
and religions in Europe.

Â

Migrant skills

Â

1Â Over half the 
migrants from non-English speaking countries have arrived with post 
school qualifications;

Â

2Â Nearly 18% of 
migrants in the period 1981-90 held tertiary degrees (8.5% for  
Australian born).

Â

Integration

Â

1Â 84% of overseas-born residents speak English;

Â

2Â 70% of eligible migrants become Australian citizens.,

Â

3Â 75% of children 
of migrants marry people of different ethnic backgrounds to themselves.

Â

Unemployment and Social Security

Â

1Â In 1993, 24.9% 
of migrants who had been in Australia for less than 3 years were unemployed. 
That figure declines to 14.2% after 8 years;

Â

2Â 34.8% of migrants 
from non-English speaking backgrounds held jobs for which they were over 
-educated and u nderpaid (compared with 11.6% of the Australian 
born population);

Â

3Â Most immigrants 
on welfare payments entered Australia under refugee or humanitarian 
programs.

Â

One Nation says:

Â

“… I believe we are in danger of being 
swamped by Asians. Between 1984 and   1995, 40% of all migrants coming into this country were of Asian 
origin.Â  They have their own culture and religion, form ghettos 
and do not assimilate.”

Â

(Pauline Hanson MP Maiden Speech 10 September 1996)

Â

“Why should the taxpayer be out there paying for someone else to 
come and live in this country? They don’t even know English or even 
have to learn …”

Â

(Pauline Hanson MP Sixty Minutes, October 20, 1996)

Â

She is wrong!

Â

Single mothers singled out

Â

Another target of ‘One Nation’ attacks recently have been  
single mothers.

Â

They would have us believe that teenage girls are 
deliberately becoming pregnant time after time, so that they can live 
- presumably in comfort - on income support paid for by the taxpayer.

Â

The reality is somewhat different.

Â

1Â Fewer tha n 2% of sole parents have another Â child while receiving 
benefits;

Â

2Â In 1997 less 
than 3% of sole parents were Â teenagers. In 1976 this figure was 11%;

Â

3Â Most sole parents remain on welfare for a Â limited period, around 
2 years;

Â

4Â 6% of sole parents are  men;

Â

5Â Teenage birth 
rates have declined from 55 per 1000 in 1971 to just 20 per 1000 in 
1996;

Â

6Â The vast majority 
of sole parent families occur as a result of marriage or relationship 
failure;

Â

7Â The average age 
of sole parents who receive welfare is 3 3;

Â

8Â It has been estimated 
that a sole parent can claim a maximum of $112 per week to care for 
a child. However, studies have concluded that it costs on average $205 
to care for a child during its first year. That's a shortfall of over 
$90 per week.

Â

With  such financial liabilities, why would anybody choose to 
pursue such a lifestyle?

Â

One Nation says

Â

“I’m going to really come down on single 
women out there who are continually having child after child, sometimes 
with different fathers, at the taxpayers’ expense.”

Â

“Let’s deal with the real issue here. There’s 
single women having more t  han one child to be on welfare”.

July 15 1998)
