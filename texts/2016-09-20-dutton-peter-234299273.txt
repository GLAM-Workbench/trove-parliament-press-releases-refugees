E&EO…………………………………………………………………………………………..

KIERAN GILBERT:

Joining me now at the United Nations is Immigration Minister Peter Dutton. Mr  Dutton thanks for your time on a big day in the focus of migration and refugees here.  What was your message during your statement to the conference earlier?

PETER DUTTON:

Well Kieran good to be with you.

Look it’s obvious to all of us listening to the speeches here that the issue of irregular  people movements of migration is going to be with us for a long time to come.

This is not a problem that’s going away and in fact speaking just then to the EU  Commissioner who has responsibility for home affairs, which includes migration  matters, this is an issue which will be around for a long period of time, whilst ever  there’s difficulty on the ground, whilst ever people are seeking a better economic  outcome, there will be irregular people movements and part of our message, part of  the Prime Minister’s message was that we have a good story to tell in Australia.

We’ve been able to secure our borders and as Australians know at the same time we  have been able to bring a record number of refugees in through the right way - that  is by plane and provide them with the settlement services so that they can start a  new life and that’s been part of our key message here.

KIERAN GILBERT:

Do you think that the message has been well received? As you say, you’ve met with  the relevant person from the European Union and also the head of the International  Organization for Migration and the High Commissioner for Refugees.

Do they think there’s a relevance there in terms of the Australian story on this issue  for their own circumstances which involve obviously a lot more people?

PETER DUTTON:

The short answer is yes. I mean there is a lot of interest particularly from European  nations about the Australian experience.

People recognise that there were 1200 people who drowned trying to get to Australia  by boat and they face the same threats in Europe. We have seen the scenes of  people drowning on the Mediterranean, but of course the other thing that we have in  common is that this is organised by people smugglers and criminal syndicates and  the same as we have problems within our own region, the people smugglers have a  presence across Europe and across Africa.

They’re taking money so there is that organised criminal syndicate aspect to it as  well, so there are many aspects to the discussion, but people yes are very interested  in the success that we have had in securing our borders and yet still being able to  bring in a record number of refugees.

KIERAN GILBERT:

What about this argument though that you need to bring the people with you in terms  of the Humanitarian Programme? Is that something that’s resonating with European  leaders particularly who are facing now political problems of more and more people  going to parties on the far-right because they don’t like well one the loss of the  control of the borders? That’s a pretty important fundamental element for them  though, isn’t it?

PETER DUTTON:

Well and it has been in Australia. I mean that’s been the Australian experience for a  long period of time.

For decades in fact people have wanted governments to exert sovereignty to make  sure that we know who’s coming to our country and it resonates even more now  because as we are seeing in Germany in the last week or so, people smugglers  have tried to bring in only a handful of people which is all you need to cause a  terrorist incident. They are trying to pass themselves off as legitimate refugees and  they come seeking to cause trouble…

KIERAN GILBERT:

…that undermines the good will doesn’t it more broadly in terms of the refugee  intake? That’s the argument isn’t it?

PETER DUTTON:

Well of course it does. I mean people want to provide the support, they want to  provide the places, but they want to know that people who are coming aren’t going to

pose a threat and secondly they want to know that places aren’t being taken by  those who are less worthy than people who might be waiting in camps in many  cases for years and years.

So people do want to extend a helping hand, but they want to help the right people  and they want to make sure that the good people who deserve help aren’t being  displaced by those who are passing themselves off as something else.

KIERAN GILBERT:

What do you say to the criticism though that’s been levelled at well you and the  Prime Minister here for making this argument that Australia has got it right and  Europe should follow suit? There has been criticism that they are not comparable.

PETER DUTTON:

Well I haven’t heard that criticism. I mean that hasn’t been put to me.

Australia has a different situation because we are not landlocked. We’re an island  nation so we have the benefit of not having borders which are porous, and that’s the  problem in Europe, and trying to enforce those land crossings and regularise those  crossings is difficult and nobody would doubt that.

So the Australian experience is different in that sense, but none the less people seek  to make the voyage across water in Australia as they do across the Mediterranean to  Europe; so there are lots of lessons that can be learnt and I look I think people are  very interested in the success that we have had in securing our borders in Australia.

KIERAN GILBERT:

One of the ongoing difficulties though remains Manus and Nauru. More than 800  genuine refugees yet to be resettled. How much does that weigh on you - the fact  that there are these people essentially still in limbo?

PETER DUTTON:

Well Kieran one of the things that I wanted desperately to do when I took up this job  almost two years ago was to get children out of detention.

There were 2000 children at the peak of Labor’s dysfunction and loss of control of  our borders in detention centres in Australia; in fact they had to open up 17 new  detention centres. Now, we have got those children out of detention, we’ve closed 17  detention centres.

My task now is to make sure that not only do we keep the boats stopped, but that we  can get people out and we are working with third countries to see what settlement  options might be available…

KIERAN GILBERT:

…any progress here on that?

PETER DUTTON:

Well we have had discussions over a long period of time with partners and I have not  commented, not ruled countries in or out, but I think we can be assured that the  Government wants to get, particularly women and children out, as a first priority from  Nauru.

We are working on that, but we have to do it in such a way that we don’t have new  arrivals filling the vacancies that we create. So there is a lot of work behind the  scenes. Operation Sovereign Borders didn’t achieve its success overnight and we  have got people smuggling syndicates who are trying to put ventures together now.

KIERAN GILBERT:

And just finally to return to something that you were alluding to earlier and that is that  the reaction politically, internationally, to the loss of control of borders - not so much  that being the issue here, but Trump regardless, Donald Trump that is, seeking to  put a ban on migration, Muslim migration in this country and it seems to be  resonating with a big chunk of people here.

What are your thoughts on that, your reflections on that?

PETER DUTTON:

Well I think from an Australian perspective we’ve always had, certainly in modern  times, a non-discriminatory policy. We look at people regardless of their religion or  their background who may pose a threat and we don’t allow those people in, we  exclude those people.

But the vast majority of people, regardless of where they come from, they come to  make a contribution, they come to make a new life and we support that.

So from a domestic perspective that will continue to be our approach and despite  calls to the contrary we want to make sure that we can weed out the small element  within any religion, within any population or within any group of people coming from a  particular region or country - we want to deal with those people consistently and we  have a ban on all of those people who seek to do us harm.

But for the vast majority of people that come across our borders, they come with  good intention and they come with the desire to start a new life and as the High  Commissioner for Refugees within the UN pointed out to me last year, Australia  along with Canada is one of the most successful countries in the world in providing  those settlement services and I think Australians should be very proud of that.

KIERAN GILBERT:

Immigration Minister Peter Dutton, appreciate your time. Thank you.
