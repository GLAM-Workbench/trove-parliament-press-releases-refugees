OPENING OF ADELAIDE MIGRANT RESOURCE CENTRE

Four grants totalling almost $7,000 to agencies in Adelaide  providing services to migrants were announced today by the  Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Mr Macphee,   when he was officially opening the new premises of the  Migrant Resource Centre of Adelaide at 122 Gouger Street  AdelaideÃ¢ÂÂ

The grants are for the following purposes:

.  to assist the Trade Union Postal Courses to develop and test a pilot information package . for non-English speaking migrant workers in  industry;

.  to assist the Lithuanian Women’s Association  to develop and extend their welfare services,  particularly to the aged;

.  to allow A.N.F.E. to purchase equipment for  its group prpgrams with aged and isolated  people in the Western Region of Adelaide;

Ã¢ÂÂ  to allow the Corporation of the Canossian Order to purchase equipment needed to develop  welfare activities for aged and isolated Italians  in the Salisbury area.

i Mr Macphee said that women of migrant background and the aged  and isolated migrants were priority areas in the Government's  migrant settlement programs.

"Working conditions and industrial rights were also areas  which the 1978 Galbally Report on Post Arrival Services  Ã¢ÂÂ   Â·  highlighted as needing special attention if migrants were to  ,  have the same access to services as all other Australian

residents",  he said.

:  M.r Macphee reaffirmed the Government’s commitment to the continuation of a comprehensive range of settlement programs  to help migrants take their place as fully participating  members of the Australian community.

"A major review of the implementation of the recommendations   of the Galbally Report had been undertaken by the Australian   Institute of Multicultural Affairs and I expect to receive it's  report shortly",  he said. "This would provide the Government  with a basis for its planning of programs into the mid 1980s."

Mr Macphee praised the Committee and staff of the MRC for  its achievements to date.  "Just one example was the .  '   valuable services being provided to Polish refugees by a  grant in aid worker located at.the Centre",  he said. "There  were,  however,  many challenges ahead for the Centre in '

fulfiling its task of being a place to which migrants could  turn for assistance.  .

"Migration*policy was constantly evolving and MRC's could  play a vital role in informing the public of the details of  changes." Mr Macphee referred to the new migrant selection  system which had been introduced from 19 April with its  emphasis on family reunion and on the availability of work  opportunities;  to the recent agreement with the Government of  Vietnam for an Orderly Departure Program; and to proposals

for changes in Citizenship legislation.

"MRC's were an alternative to DepartmentalÂ·Services",  he said.  "The Adelaide Centre, with its central base in. the city and  outlets in the suburbs and Whyalla served areas of high migrant  density. .  .

"Because of its focus on migrant issues,  and its management by  locally based committees representative of migrants in the  areas, the MRC was well placed to assist and represent migrant  users."Â· .  .
