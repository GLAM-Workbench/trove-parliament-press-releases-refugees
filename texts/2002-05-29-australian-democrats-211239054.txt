Senator Andrew Bartlett Australian Democrats’ Immigration Spokesperson

29 May 2002  MEDIA RELEASE                          02/273

Amnesty condemns Australia’s mandatory detention The international report released by Amnesty International condemning Australia’s practice of arbitrary detention of asylum seekers for indefinite periods of time should cause the federal Labor Party to rethink its policy supporting this inhumane practice.

Democrats’ spokesperson for Immigration, Senator Andrew Bartlett, said that Australia’s arbitrary detention of asylum seekers had once again drawn the ire of Amnesty International, yet the Howard/Costello Government remains defiant in the face of the continual international backlash.

“This Government refuses to abide by the United Nations Refugee and Human Rights’ Conventions; despite being a long time signatory of the Conventions. But the Howard/Costello Government has put international agreements, compassion and humanity aside for the sake of domestic political opportunism,” said Senator Bartlett.

“The latest annual Amnesty International report on Australia highlights the Federal Government’s major legislative measures, actions and costs associated with impeding the passage of asylum seekers to mainland Australia.

“Amnesty is scathing of Australia and its response to a desperate and vulnerable people. Yet, despite the international outcry the ALP has re-affirmed its commitment to mandatory detention.

“This is outrageous given that Australia’s international position is being eroded by the Federal Government’s policies and the ‘me too’ statements from the Opposition,” said Senator Bartlett.

“If the Government isn’t prepared to heed the international community, then it should at least acknowledge the consequences of its decisions domestically and not hide behind the ‘fund the war against terror and secure our borders’ rhetoric,” concluded Senator Bartlett.
