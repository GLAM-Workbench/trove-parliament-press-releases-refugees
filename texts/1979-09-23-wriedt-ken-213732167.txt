PRESS RELEASE

A strong,  independent Vietnam would be less  likely to fall into the hands of the Soviet Union and  could lead to greater stability within the whole of  the South East Asian region.

This was said by Senator Ken Wriedt, Opposition  Senate Leader and Shadow Spokesman on Foreign Affairs,   in an address on Australia-Vletnam relations at a meeting  in Melbourne today.

Australia should adopt policies to encourage  economic reconstruction within Vietnam to assist its  quest for independence and to.reduce its need to take  drastic action such as encouraging the flow of refugees.Â·

Rather than cutting off aid, there should be a  substantial increase in the amount of aid going to that  country.

We should continue to encourage the United States  to normalise relations with the Vietnamese Government  and subsequently to assist in the reconstruction there.

Australia should support the strengthening of  ties between Vietnam and its ASEAN neighbours.

Without a lowering of tension between the two,  stability in the region can never be guaranteed.

WORLD COUNTRIES SETTING OUT THEIR POPULATION AND GROSS

DOMESTIC PRODUCT PER CAPITA FOR THE YEAR 1 9 7 5 , THAT

INFORMATION BEARS OUT THE COMMITTEE'S ASSERTION THAT THERE

IS A CONSIDERABLE GULF BETWEEN THE RICHEST AND POOREST

OF THE THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES,

Th u s, for ex a m p l e  o i l  r i c h  St a t e s  are e x t r e m e l y  w ealthy  in

COMPARISON WITH THE POOREST OF THE THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES,

For example  the Un i t e d  Arab Em i r a t e s  had a GDP per c a p i t a

in 1975 of $ 1 3 ,6 8 0 ,

One of the poorest  c o u n t r ie s  i n the world  acc or d in g  to

THE LIST PUBLISHED IN THAT REPORT IS VIETNAM. WlTH AN

ESTIMATED POPULATION IN 1975 OF JUST OVER 45 MILLION,

ITS PER CAPITA GDP WAS $160, On t h a t  b a s i s  i t  i s  w i t h i n

THE TWENTY POOREST COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD. ITS PER

CAPITA GDP IS SLIGHTLY HIGHER THAN THAT OF AFGHANISTAN,

Ba n g l a d e s h , Burma , Et h i o p i a  and I n d i a , b u t f a l l s  far below

t h a t  of An g o l a , Gh a n a , Ni g e r i a  and Ug a n d a ,

The f ig u r e s  i n  r e s p e c t  of other  I ndo-Ch i n e s e  c o u n t r ie s  i s

EVEN MORE APPALLING, KAMPUCHEA AND LApS WERE THE TWO

POOREST OF THE THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES IN 1 9 7 5 , HAVING HAD

A PER CAPITA GDP OF $70 EACH, I n  LIGHT OF EVENTS WHICH HAVE

HAPPENED SINCE THEN, THEIR POSITION IS UNLIKELY TO HAVE

IMRPOVED, '

The co m par iso n  between  V ie t n a m  and i t s  ASEAN n eig h bo u r s  i s

ALSO REVEALING, IGNORING SINGAPORE WHICH IS EXTREMELY

WEALTHY IN COMPARISON WITH THE OTHERS, THE GDP PER CAPITA

OF THE FOUR MAJOR ASEAN NATIONS IS APPROXIMATELY TWICE THAT

Wh a t has caused  the Au s t r a l ia n  Government  to respond  so

VIOLENTLY TO VIETNAM?

Amongst  the s t a t e d  reasons  are Vi e t n a m ' s i n v a s i o n  of

Kampuchea  and i t s  o f f i c i a l l y  c o n t r iv e d  refugee  e x o d u s .

Ch i n a  has r e c e iv e d  only  the m i l d e s t  of rebukes  for i t s  !

INVASION OF VIETNAM. .

Why then  has Au s t r a l i a  responded  to strong Ly to the s i t u a t i o n

in I ndo-Ch i n a ? The answer  must  l i e  in the f a c t  t h a t  the '

Au s t r a l i a n  Government  takes  an u n u s u a l  v ie w  of Vie t n a m  because

OF THE HISTORY OF OUR RELATIONS WITH THAT COUNTRY. !

As A RESULT, THERE WAS A MANOEUVRE AT THAT TIME WHICH INVOLVED the Un i t e d  St a t e s , the Diem Government  and Au s t r a l i a  , and

SUBSEQUENTLY AUSTRALIA BECAME COMMITTED TO MILITARY !

INTERVENTION IN SUPPORT OF THE DlEM REGIME,

Wi t h  the ad van tag e  of h i s t o r i c a l  h i n d s i g h t  and a f u l l

KNOWLEDGE OF THE FACTS, IT CAN NOW BE SEEN THAT AUSTRALIA'S

ROLE AT THAT STAGE WAS SOMEWHAT DISCREDITABLE.

V i e t n a m , Dr, Robert  O'Ne i l l p o in t e d  out t h a t  one could  only

SPECULATE AS TO THE ROLE PLAYED BY AUSTRALIA IN VIETNAMESE/

AMERCI AN RELATIONS AT THAT T IM E . ARMED WITH THAT INFORMATION

WHICH WE NOW HAVE, SUCH SPECULATION IS NO LONGER NECESSARY.

AS A RESULT OF A STATEMENT MADE BY THE PRIME MINISTER IN

the House of Re p r e s e n t a t i v e s  on the 13th May 1975, a paper

DEALING WITH AUSTRALIA'S MILITARY COMMITMENT TO VIETNAM

WAS TABLED IN THE PARLIAMENT. ÃÂªÃÂÃ‘ÃÂ¤ PAPER PROVIDES DAMNING

EVIDENCE OF AUSTRALIA'S INVOLVEMENT IN THE EARLY STAGES

OF THE SECOND I nDO-Ch INA WAR.

CONSIDERING AUSTRALIA'S RESPONSES TO THE VARIOUS MOVES

AT THAT TIME, In DEALING WITH THE PROVISION OF MILITARY

ASSISTANCE TO SOUTH VIETNAM, THE PAPER HAD THIS TO SAY:~

" Au s t r a l i a n  m i l i t a r y  a s s i s t a n c e  to South V ie t n a m  was not at

ANY TIME IN RESPONSE TO A REQUEST FOR DEFENCE AID FROM

South V ie t n a m  as a Protocol  St a t e  to SEATO as a Treaty

AS THINGS TURNED OUT, AUSTRALIA DID GET A FORWARD LOOKING

GOVERNMENT IN 1972 WHICH EXTENDED AID TO NORTH VIETNAM

FOLLOWING THE SIGNING OF THE PARIS. AGREEMENT,

At the t i m e  the p r o v i s i o n  of t h a t  a i d  was strongly

CRITICISED BY THE LIBERAL-COUNTRY PARTY OPPOSITION.
