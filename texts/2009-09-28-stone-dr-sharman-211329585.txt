AUSTRALIA’S IMMIGRATION CONTROLS IN TOTAL CHAOS

The Hon Dr Sharman Stone MP

Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship

Australia’s immigration controls are in total chaos as people smugglers rush to take advantage of Labor’s open

back door to Australia.

Two more boats arrived yesterday bringing a total of 37 boats since Labor weakened Immigration policy. Over

1760 unauthorised arrivals have now been taken to Christmas Island since August 2008.

One of the most recent boats was intercepted 93 nautical miles northwest of Darwin, carrying 12 passengers.

The other was intercepted only seven nautical miles northwest of Ashmore Island carrying 28 passengers and

four crew.

Ten boats have arrived in the month of September and an unknown number have been intercepted by

Indonesian authorities before asylum seekers have boarded their boats or shortly after pushing off to sea.

The Rudd Government has lost control of who comes into Australia. They are only focussed on intercepting the

boats and finding new beds. They are not interrupting the smuggler operations by reviewing the factors and

looking at the changed policies that became the honey pot for this new rush.

Prime Minister Rudd and Immigration Minister Senator Chris Evans must begin to count the cost in lives lost, in

border security compromised and in the dollars diverted away from attending to the new settler needs of those

invited into Australia as part of our official refugee intake. These refugees are now struggling to find adequate

accommodation, to learn English and to get jobs.

Australia’s reputation for strong border protection and immigration control is now in tatters. The Government must

urgently launch an inquiry into the relationship between their softening of border protection and the rush in people

smuggling in Australia.
