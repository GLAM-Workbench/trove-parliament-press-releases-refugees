More Sri Lankans returned to Colombo

A further 31 Sri Lankan irregular maritime arrivals are being returned to Colombo after failing to  meet Australia’s international obligations, Minister for Immigration and Citizenship Brendan  O'Connor said today.

The group departed Christmas Island today to be flown back to the Sri Lankan capital.

Their return takes the number of Sri Lankans sent home to 1,130 - 919 of them involuntarily - since  August last year.

Mr O’Connor said returning the group to Sri Lankans sends a powerful message.

“The Gillard Government is making it crystal clear that those who pay smugglers are throwing  theirmoney away and risking their lives in the process,” Mr O'Connor said.

“We are committed to breaking the evil people smuggling trade, deterring people from taking  dangerous journeys by boat and saving lives at sea.

“When people arrive in Australia without authorisation, any claims they make for their reasons to  travel to Australia are assessed by the Department of Immigration and Citizenship.

“If these claims are not covered by the Refugee Convention, they will be returned to their homeland  wherever possible.

“There is no visa on arrival, there is no speedy outcome, and there is no special treatment.

“We will continue to transfer people to Nauru and Manus Island.”

People returned involuntarily do not have access to reintegration assistance.
