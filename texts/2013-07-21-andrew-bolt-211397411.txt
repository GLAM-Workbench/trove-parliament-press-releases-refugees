THE HON JOE HOCKEY MP

SHADOW TREASURER

THE BOLT REPORT,   CHANNEL TEN   SUNDAY, 21 JULY 2013



E&OE…………………………………………………………………………………

PRESENTER:

Kevin Rudd’s announcements this week is carbon tax con and boat people fix. Both cost  billions of dollars. Joining me is Shadow Treasurer, Joe Hockey. He will think that is money  well spent?

JOE HOCKEY:

What we do know about Kevin Rudd is that you have got to look behind at what he says.  With Kevin Rudd he will sell you French champagne and you end up with light beer. What  we do is that he will charge the Australian taxpayer the full cost of all of his failures as well  as all of his promises. Who knows what the total cost of these sort of promises are? But when  it comes to the carbon tax, you can be sure it is going to continue to rise to $38 a tonne - and  that is on today’s numbers.  If, as Warwick McKibbon says, there is a fall in the Australian  dollar of around 30% against the Euro you can end up with $40 a tonne from next year for  Australian carbon emissions. It is all smoke and mirrors from Kevin Rudd.

PRESENTER:

Let’s look at the boat people fix. On paper, I think, it makes sense - taking boat people and  sending them to Papua New Guinea and telling them they can never come here.  Have you  got any reason to doubt it won’t work, as Kevin Rudd says?

JOE HOCKEY:

Mr Rudd was the one that actually started the boats again. He is never going to stop them and  if he does it will be temporary. As we dig into the agreement between Australia and Papua  New Guinea a few things are becoming clear. Number one, the people that go to Papua New  Guinea could end up on Centrelink and Medicare for the rest of their lives as well as the  Australian taxpayer funding their housing, their education, their security and everything else.  That is quite obvious from what is not said in the agreement as much as what is said.

Secondly, what is clear is that this can be reviewed after 12 months. In fact, Papua New  Guinea can give up on the entire agreement if it becomes just too hard. Thirdly, what is  patently clear is people can still come to Australia. It is just Kevin Rudd’s word when he says  people will not come to Australia, but that has not stopped Kevin Rudd advertising this. In  what can only be described as outrageous use of taxpayer’s money Kevin Rudd is advertising  to stop the boats here in Australia for purely political purposes. But the fact is Mr Rudd said  back in 2007 that Government advertising just before an election is a ‘cancer’ and he wanted  to stop it. Well, the cancer is alive and well under Kevin Rudd.

PRESENTER:

How come you guys didn’t think of making such a deal with Papua New Guinea?

JOE HOCKEY:

We are in Opposition; we cannot do deals like that. It is totally inappropriate for an  opposition party to do deals with foreign governments and I understand that from a foreign  government perspective. But the fact is that it is only the Coalition that is going to stop the  boats and it was Kevin Rudd that started them. Now we have approaching 50,000 people that  have come by boat at a cost of up to $12 billion. Now we have a blank cheque for what is  Kevin Rudd’s latest solution that he claims is going to fix the problem that he started five  years ago.

PRESENTER:

Would you keep this deal?

JOE HOCKEY:

We would certainly look at trying to make it work. It is only the Coalition that can make  these things work time and time again.

PRESENTER:

But you would keep it?

JOE HOCKEY:

It would be starting point but we have got to get to the bottom of it. I just can’t believe that  these things have not been defined.  The Government has found a budget for its advertising of  the deal but it has not found a budget for the deal. We are trying to get to the bottom of what  it really means. Like everything else - like Kevin Rudd’s claim on the carbon tax this week  and his PNG claim - when you get to the details that is when you discover that it is not what  it seems.  As I said, Kevin Rudd promises French champagne and delivers light beer.

PRESENTER:

I agree with you that both the deals when you look at them closely are less than what is sold.  But the point is Kevin Rudd has got something to say about carbon tax and boats which were

your two big claims for a couple of years now. Do you regret not having broadened your  pitch to the electorate before now?

JOE HOCKEY:

Our pitch is far broader than the abolition of the carbon tax and stopping the boats. It is also  about the economy, as a starting point. It is only the Coalition that is going to provide job  security. It is only the Coalition that is going to reduce the cost of living. We have a six point  plan to grow productivity in Australia. We have made major announcements about  infrastructure. Even yesterday Tony Abbott announced funding for a children’s palliative care  clinic in Brisbane. We have been making announcements every day for our plans for  Australia’s future but they are being drowned out by the celebrity Kevin Rudd. Sooner or  later people will see through Kevin Kardashian and focus on what a Prime Minister and a  Government really should do and that is provide proper governance for the nation.

PRESENTER:

Joe Hockey, thank you so much for joining us.

JOE HOCKEY:

Thank you.
