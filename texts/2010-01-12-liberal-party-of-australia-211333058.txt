E&OE

MIKE O’LOUGHLIN:

Warren Entsch, how are you Waz? Thumper?

WARREN ENTSCH:

...after a great Christmas and New Year.

MIKE O’LOUGHLIN:

Happy New Year to you.

WARREN ENTSCH:

And Happy New Year to you too my friend and of course all your listeners.

MIKE O’LOUGHLIN:

Thank you. And a very slim, fit, young man opposite me. Mr Tony Abbott, good morning.

TONY ABBOTT:

Good morning, good morning it is nice to be here.

MIKE O’LOUGHLIN:

And of course may I call you Tony?

TONY ABBOTT:

You can. If I can call you Mike, you can call me Tony.

MIKE O’LOUGHLIN:

Done. Well listen, let’s start off, I want to find out first of all you are up here because, and the announcement will

be made at nine, but we need to say why you are here which is, and I read in The Australian a Franklin dam-style

federal overthrow of state laws with a private member’s bill to strike down the Queensland Government’s

controversial Wild Rivers legislation. That’s what The Australian headline stated.

TONY ABBOTT:

Yeah and that’s pretty right Mike. I have been concerned for a long time about this Wild Rivers Act, at least

insofar as it applies to Cape York. It takes away from local Cape York people the ability to turn their land into an

economic asset and if we are going to be fair dinkum about allowing Aboriginal people in particular the right to get

ahead you can’t lock up their land, and that is effectively what this Wild Rivers legislation has done. It has meant

that if an Aboriginal person in Cape York wants to have an economic future he or she has basically either got to

leave or accept that it is going to be life on welfare back home.

MIKE O’LOUGHLIN:

And I know that our old mate sitting next to you Warren Entsch has certainly been fighting for this one. It is a big

hearted issue and that’s why if you are interested, you want to find out more, we urge you to get down to The

Esplanade at nine. That’s when you will be making the major announcements.

TONY ABBOTT:

That’s right and Warren, who as you rightly say, Mike, has been very concerned about this for a long time, as well

as a lot of local Aboriginal people - Warren has assembled some of the local elders who will be there at nine

o’clock at The Esplanade.

MIKE O’LOUGHLIN:

And of course if you want to comment you can give us a call on 1300 872 911, 4031 1846. So that’s why you are

here, we know that, and I think there’s going to be, and looking forward to hearing you talk to Macca later on

about that. But let’s move on to some other issues. I want to talk about first all let’s talk about people smuggling.

What are your thoughts there? Because I will go on to say a comment by John Howard about Tony Abbott, it

said: ‘Tony is a close friend of mine. He is a person who has enormous intellect, great vigour, enormous energy,

very, very strong attitudes and I respected that in him. I will do everything I can to assist him.’ What a great

comment in regard to a book launch. But if you go back to Howard’s people smuggling issues, very strong. How

are you in that?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well I would like to say that I am very much in the John Howard tradition. Now John Howard has been unfairly

maligned. He has been accused of lacking compassion. But the truth is that any policy which encourages people

to take to the sea in leaky boats in the hope of getting a good life in Australia is not a compassionate policy

because people get hurt. We have seen probably 40 or 50 people die in the attempt to get to Australia since

Kevin Rudd watered down the policy. Now you know I accept that Kevin Rudd is acting with good intentions but

unfortunately good intentions can be very dangerous in this area. And what John Howard did was he found a

difficult situation and he stopped the boats coming. Kevin Rudd found a good situation and he started the boats

coming again which is a real tragedy.

MIKE O’LOUGHLIN:

And of course we are running out of room.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well I don’t know if we are quite running out of room, I mean it’s a vast…

MIKE O’LOUGHLIN:

On that little island I am talking about over there.

TONY ABBOTT:

That’s right. We’re certainly running out of room on Christmas Island. I mean Australia is a big country but we

want the people who come to this country to come in accordance with our rules, we don’t want them to come in

accordance with Rafferty’s Rules and that’s the problem at the moment.

MIKE O’LOUGHLIN:

Well listen I want to move on from people smugglers to budgie smugglers.

TONY ABBOTT:

Yeah I thought you might get on to that.

MIKE O’LOUGHLIN:

And I thought, no look it smooths its way in, it segways well, you have got to go…..

WARRAN ENTSCH:

I told you he was subtle.

TONY ABBOTT:

He will want to talk about the love rug, but you see he has had a couple of facelifts, that’s why he has got a love

rug on his chin.

MIKE O’LOUGHLIN:

That’s it. I have got the love rug on the chin. I love it. But the budgies, I have got to say I have never known just

for a photo where you are looking fit and in all the trim and all that sort of caper, all of a sudden to get the

greatest bunch of publicity ever known to man and I am thinking there’s Tony Abbott in the DTs, we’ll have a

resurgence back to those.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well look, yeah, it does seem to have been one of the most talked about photos in the last little while. But I was

participating in the club swim at Queenscliff Surf Club and Speedos are the uniform Mike. So you know I would

have been the oddest looking club swimmer if I had anything other than the Speedos on.

WARRAN ENTSCH:

I have to challenge you on that. If I was standing beside you in budgie smugglers, mate I would have been the

issue I can tell you.

MIKE O’LOUGHLIN:

But let’s talk about Tony Abbott. I mean you got a by-election in March `94 etc, we know your history. You are

living in Forestville with Margaret and three daughters.

TONY ABBOTT:

That’s right I am surrounded by strong women in my household.

MIKE O’LOUGHLIN:

Because it was interesting, there’s an article - and I have got it here, I’ll just see if I can find it - about attracting

the women voters. And I remember reading this and I thought with interest, Tony Abbott’s crusade to woo the

women voters. And I thought with that many women in your household they must be giving you some damn good

advice surely?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well they give me stern instructions everyday. I am afraid I am often not that good at taking the advice but

certainly I get it and when I don’t take it, it is usually to my cost. On those occasions when Margie has told me

what she thinks and I have gone off and gaily done my own thing, 99 per cent of the time I have been wrong. But

they are not the only strong women in my life. There are three tough women sitting outside this studio at the

moment.

MIKE O’LOUGHLIN:

And glairing in at me. I think good heavens, I have got to be so careful.

TONY ABBOTT:

That’s right. I think they are smiling when you do the right thing, Locco, and glaring when you ask the tricky

questions.

MIKE O’LOUGHLIN:

But let’s go into your education. Sydney Uni, Economics, Law. First grade rugby - that’s interesting because

rugby is huge up here. Then Rhode Scholar at Oxford, MA in Politics and Philosophy and we did hear you won a

couple of blues in boxing.

TONY ABBOTT:

Yeah but that was against Poms though Mike, and as you know Poms are the easy beats if it is Australia versus

England.

MIKE O’LOUGHLIN:

Well listen we have got to talk more and I want to talk about writing a book because Kevin Rudd has and it is very

important, and it is an important book and you are a bit of a book writer. We’ll talk more about that in just a tick

with 4CA.

[commercial break]

MIKE O’LOUGHLIN:

News talk 4CA. It is 18 minutes past seven. Our special guest Tony Abbott with Warren Entsch in the studio. And

Tony if I can mention you have written a couple of books in the defence of the existing constitutional system. One

was The Minimal Monarchy and then the other one was How to win the Constitutional War. So in regard to

books, Kevin Rudd has just written one too. It is probably of the similar ilk - Jasper and Abby and the Great

Australia Day Kerfuffle. I was wondering would you be considering writing one of those?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well look my most recent book was called Battlelines and that was a book on where I thought Australia should be

going in the future and it was published about six months, Mike. So if people would like to read a book by the

Opposition Leader I would recommend Battlelines. If they would like to read a book by the Prime Minister, well

there’s this kiddie’s book coming out. Now I am all in favour on politicians writing books and I think it is good that

the Prime Minister has written this book for kids. But it would be good if we had clearer ideas from the Prime

Minister on exactly what he wanted for our country because whenever Kevin Rudd gives a speech I have got to

say it is very hard to discern what he’s really talking about some times.

MIKE O’LOUGHLIN:

Well you are getting a bit of a rep for being the black and white guy - which I think is a good thing too because it

is nice to know for a change. I’ve got to then move onto that. Another headline that I think is very important Japan

has risked an open breach with the Rudd Government by hitting back hard at Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard’s

handling of last week’s whaling confrontation in the southern ocean. So how many times have we seen that

footage of the Maru 2 hitting the Ady Gil - or was it the other way round. We don’t know. So what are your

thoughts?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well look, the Government typically has been all talk and no action on this. They said before the election that they

were going to take Japan to the International Court of Justice. They haven’t done that. They said before the

election and subsequently that they were going to send a ship to the Southern Ocean to try to sort this issue out.

They haven’t done that. What I think we need to do is now that the Oceanic Viking no longer has asylum seekers

on it and is available for deployment, we should despatch that with all haste to the Southern Ocean, to this

particular trouble spot to try to stop these confrontations taking place. Now if the Oceanic Viking is down there as

the representative of Australia, a, we will know exactly what is happening; we won’t have to rely on either the

Japanese version or the protesters version and, b, by keeping apart the whalers and the protesters, hopefully we

will actually protect a few whales.

MIKE O’LOUGHLIN:

See that to me is a really important thing. We are forgetting about the whales. I personally don’t like to see the

slaughter of whales.

TONY ABBOTT:

No, none of us do.

MIKE O’LOUGHLIN:

That’s just horrendous and we want to stop it. But do you really want to see a war going on? Initially we thought it

was a little bit chaotic when they were throwing the dye bombs and they were doing a bit of that and then there

was a nudge I remember a year or so ago. A little bit nasty. But this is a confrontation that you have got to think,

when you see that footage and you see also the hose coming off the Shonan Maru 2 as they have even split the

Ady Gil in half, they have hosed them as they’re passing by. So it is a little bit rough.

TONY ABBOTT:

It is an ugly situation. It is hard to know where the balance of right and wrong lies here. That’s why if an

Australian ship was on site to stop this confrontation we would all be a lot better off. Now why on earth they don’t

send the Oceanic Viking southwards immediately is a mystery to me because that is where it is needed. That’s its

job.

WARREN ENTSCH:

I was going to say though when we look at what is happening there and we look at these green groups and their

bid to stop whaling, I see a fairly high level of hypocrisy there. I was only talking about this earlier on. We have

got a situation there where the green groups are turning themselves inside out to stop whaling. A very admirable

cause. We have also got a situation here - you only have to have a look across the street - a fruit bat colony.

You go over there and sneeze under that you will have the greenies jumping down your throat in a flash. You

can’t disturb them during the day because they have got to sleep.

MIKE O’LOUGHLIN:

As long as you don’t park your car underneath them….

WARREN ENTSCH:

Yeah I met some Lakeside residents up at the Yungaburra on the weekend and you know there is colony of fruit

bats that have moved into there after Cyclone Larry. The population is growing every year. They have now got to

a point where they have been told they have discontent their rain water tanks because the bats are crapping all

over their - because they are living right over their houses - and they are crapping all over their roof and they are

contaminating the tanks. If you have a look at the area underneath where these bats are living now - I mean it is

breading season at the moment, there are literally hundreds and hundreds of carcasses, I mean they live and

they die there and they just lay and they rot. If somebody was to walk in underneath there and clap their hands or

make a noise, anyway try to disturb those bats, they are up for a $10,000 fine and the greenies would be crawling

all over them. I mean it is interesting that they do that.

Now out on the Coral Sea we have seen what Garrett has done out there with the bidding of the American group

called Pew. As a precautionary measure they have shut it down, they are now talking about a no take zone -

strongly supported by the ACF and the same mob that is pushing for the whales.

But when was the last time you heard any of the green groups come out and raise any level of concern in relation

to their illegal taking and inappropriate taking of turtles and dugongs in this country. There is absolutely deathly

silent and you have got to ask the question why? I mean it is just insane. And there have been a few voices that

have been raising concerns about this, certainly, but not getting the attention of government and certainly not

getting any attention of these so-called green groups that are out there so passionate about you know protecting

all creatures great and small. Yet the indiscriminate slaughter or turtles and dugongs, both of them extremely

vulnerable, goes on without any issues raised whatsoever - and I think it is about time you know they started to

deal with this. You would have heard Colin Riddell who has been on the program many times raising this issue.

Some years ago I had a dugong net, which I still have, that was made purposely for catching and slaughtering

dugong and yet the green groups can’t see it in themselves to raise an issue. Government can’t see it in

themselves to deal with this. They always agree there’s a problem but they do absolutely nothing about it. So I

think there’s a hell of a lot of hypocrisy there, Locco, and I think it is an issue that we have got to continue to

pursue.

MIKE O’LOUGHLIN:

And I love the fact that you are so passionate. You are not only passionate Waz about the dugongs etc but even

the cassowaries and the birds and I love that about you.

WARREN ENTSCH:

And I like the fact that Tony is sitting here too and he is listening to this as hopefully our next leader in

government and will be able to actually, well whether we are in government or out of government I think it is

important that we put up policies and initiatives on this and we force others to follow suit.

MIKE O’LOUGHLIN:

Well listen that brings me on to something. I love to move into the light and shade. But moving to a movie called

Abbottar, sorry, Avatar. I always get that wrong. But that could probably be with the Green issues, couldn’t it?

TONY ABBOTT:

Aren’t they blue?

MIKE O’LOUGHLIN:

And I loved that. I remember seeing that and I thought, oh well, that gives you some of the green credit. It’s one

of the highest… I mean it has outsold Titanic, and I thought we should change that to Abbottar. Outselling Rudd.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well lets hope that’s what happens come election time. I haven’t seen it yet though, Mike, I’ve got to say,

but I did see the cartoon in The Australian a couple of days ago and I was tickled pink, so to speak.

MIKE O’LOUGHLIN:

A very good cartoon. Also, moving onto something else, I was reading about you and I thought, I like cycling and

cycling from Cairns to Karumba and all over the place, and I’ve cycled from the Missouri River to the Mississippi

and as you can tell, I’m an athlete… Not. But you’ve started something called Pollie Pedal back in 1998. Tell me

about Pollie Pedal because it’s raising money for good causes.

TONY ABBOTT:

Yeah, and this year we’ll be raising money for Aboriginal health scholarships at Sydney University because if we

are fair dinkum about closing the health gap between Aboriginal people and the rest of us, you’ve got to have

health professionals who are ready to work with Aboriginal people, and particularly you’ve got to have Aboriginal

people working as doctors and nurses so that’s what Pollie Pedal will be doing this year. It’s a thousand

kilometre, more or less, bike ride. Myself and a few colleagues have done it every year. It started off in 1998 with

Jackie Kelly and Ross Cameron and me. Unfortunately, Ross and Jackie are out of the Parliament, but Pat

Farmer still does it with me

MIKE O’LOUGHLIN:

Oh good. You don’t want to jog with Pat though, do you?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I did jog a hundred kilometres with Pat one day from Mona Vale Hospital to Campbelltown Hospital and Pat

said to me after about sixty kilometres, ‘just because I used to be able to run eighty kilometres a day, doesn’t

mean I still can’. But I tell you what, he still did.

MIKE O’LOUGHLIN:

I mean, it’s a lesson for all of us: never get into a dare with you in regard to fitness.

WARREN ENTSCH:

I can keep up with him on my Harley.

MIKE O’LOUGHLIN:

Yeah that’d be right.

TONY ABBOTT:

But, look, the Pollie Pedal is nothing, Mike, compared to Warren Entsch’s ride-on mower race to Cape York.

MIKE O’LOUGHLIN:

That was interesting! You didn’t get the Olympic torch but you got the mower.

WARREN ENTSCH:

I’m still using it to mow the lawn now. I bought it at a charity auction after.

MIKE O’LOUGHLIN:

We’re moving all over the place. Entschy, you want to talk about whales and federal magistrates. Tie that in for

me.

WARREN ENTSCH:

Well it’s very difficult to tie federal magistrates into whales but as I came into here today, I said to you I had

another one of our losses. I’m keeping a tally. I mean we lost NQEA, we lost our naval contract, we lost our Area

Consultative Committee, we lost my baby, the Cairns Youth Mentoring Scheme, and I’ve just found out that we’ve

just lost our federal magistrate. Now, you know, when I first came into office in 1996 the overwhelming majority of

people that came through my office were people with child support issues and with family law issues and I tell

you what, some of them were pretty distressing. And in most cases, well in nearly all cases it involved children.

And Tony you’ll recall we had a number of reviews and examinations into the circumstance and it was decided

that we needed to get quick access to dealing with a lot of these problems.

If we could have somebody there that they could sit down with and start an intervention if you like, a lot of these

things could be resolved before they got out of hand. And we established the federal magistrate. It was identified

that Cairns was one of the key areas and we had one brought into Cairns. And, overnight almost, the numbers of

people coming into my office just disappeared. That doesn’t mean to say there wasn’t the odd issue, but

nevertheless it helped. It was amazing. The legal practitioners here had somewhere that they could refer to, they

could get these cases dealt with very, very quickly and people could get on with their lives. I’ve just been told that

a decision has been made to no longer fund a position in Cairns and they’re of the view that we can adequately

be serviced from Townsville. I mean, next year it’ll be adequately serviced from Brisbane. I mean, it is just insane.

Now, I’m going to be talking to a number of the legal practitioners about this. We’ve got to draw a line in the sand.

How many more services? Our Aboriginal and Islander Alcohol Relief Service - shut it down. How many other

services are we going to lose? They talk about us losing opportunities for jobs and what have you here in Cairns.

All of this social infrastructure that has been built over many, many years strongly supported by the Cairns

community, many of these things creating opportunities for jobs, like Douglas House and Rose Collis house,

there was a lot of jobs associated with that, as there was with NQEA and Area Consultative Committee - all of

those things are being lost now and what does our local federal member doing? Absolutely nothing. And I think

it’s a disgrace and I’ll be certainly following it on and you’ll hear a hell of a lot more about it in the time to come.

MIKE O’LOUGHLIN:

Well, we’re going to have more with Tony Abbott and Warren Entsch in just a tick with 4CA.

MIKE O’LOUGHLIN:

It’s Locco, Mike O’Loughlin with you, with Tony Abbott and Warren Entsch and Jane Baxter has joined us in the

studio. Happy New year, Janey.

JANE BAXTER:

Happy New Year. Back again already.

MIKE O’LOUGHLIN:

God! It’s the noughties. You wanted to ask also from your perspective.

JANE BAXTER:

Well, I did have a couple of questions. Obviously within the Liberal Party there’s been some dissention. As

Leader, what’s your vision for the future?

TONY ABBOTT:

Okay, well look the Liberal Party should always be the party of lower taxes, smaller government and greater

freedom. But, we are also the party of stronger families and respect for institutions which have stood the test of

time. Now, these I hope are the permanent things that the Liberal Party will always stand for. At the moment

we’re on about stopping Kevin Rudd’s great big new tax, which is what this emissions trading scheme is about.

It’s a tax policy masquerading as an environment policy. We are also about trying to ensure that Kevin Rudd

doesn’t further water down border security policy. We want to hold the Prime Minister to his promise to fix public

hospitals which plainly he hasn’t done. The other thing which is a big worry is these work place changes. I mean

Kevin Rudd’s been talking for the last two years about WorkChoices as if that was still the issue. Well I think now

the issue is going to be services closing because Kevin Rudd’s new industrial laws are going to make it

impossible for them to stay open after hours and on weekends. For instance, I was talking to a local pharmacist

last night. He’s an after-hours and weekend pharmacists, he reckons his wages bill is going to go up by

something like seventy thousand dollars a year. That means that it’s going to be a lot harder to get your

prescription filled if you’re crook late night or on the weekend.

MIKE O’LOUGHLIN:

And small business suffering.

JANE BAXTER:

That’s it.

TONY ABBOTT:

Absolutely, look small business is the backbone of the economy. It’s the dynamic section of the economy. It’s

where people are most likely to get jobs if they haven’t currently got a job and unfortunately Kevin Rudd’s new

laws are going to make it harder for people to be employed. They are going to make it harder for small business

to service the public. Over the last twenty years we’ve developed a great service culture in this country. That kind

of shutdown at midday on Saturday mindset which we used to have has all gone and I think Kevin Rudd wants to

bring it back.

JANE BAXTER:

Okay. Well, in terms of Cairns and obviously our region certainly suffering at the moment with unemployment,

what would you do if you if you were in power. What would you be looking at doing to help the average person in

Cairns?

TONY ABBOTT:

Okay, well look the thing that I am here to announce today, Jane, is an attempt to overturn the Wild Rivers

legislation insofar as it applies to Cape York because this is stymieing economic development on Cape York. It

was hard enough anyway, but the Wild Rivers legislation has made it that much harder. It’s tough for Aboriginal

people, it’s tough for the other stake holders, the pastoralists, the miners who want to work up there in the Cape.

So, that’s what I’m on about today. Warren has got a whole lot of other things that he wants me to focus on.

Obviously there is the recent decision which is going to make it harder to fish in the Coral Sea. I’m still getting up

to speed on that one. There’s the withdrawal of federal services. Today it seems we’re going to lose a magistracy

service from here in Cairns. In the end the first rule of government should be to do no harm and when you close

things down which are existing services you do harm and that is a bad thing. It should not happen without very,

very good reasons. It shouldn’t just happen because the Government has certainly got into its head that it’s got to

pull its oars all in.

MIKE O’LOUGHLIN:

So nine o’clock, we need to be aware if you’re interested in the Wild Rivers - and so many people are concerned

about this issue - The Esplanade that’s the place to be at nine, because that’s where you will make the big

announcement and certainly looking forward to that. The north end of the Esplanade Waz? But listen, I just read

something and I thought this would be great to finish up with your good self. It was from the paper. ‘This week

Australia’s economic soothsayers and market alchemists will again pour over data from the Aussie Bureau of

Stats. Most eyes will be on the release of the November retail trade numbers, the economy leading up Christmas,

but beyond the tide of information about everything from credit growth to new car sales, retail spending and

housing investment there was a wealth of other less conventional ways some people use to measure the strength

of our economy. Take women’s hemlines, for example.’ Now, here it is known as the skirt length index. Now, I

thought that we could have the Abbott budgie smuggler index. But it’s the skirt… the theory being that in buoyant

economic times and amid rising financial markets, women’s skirts tend to get shorter. Where journalists get this

information from I don’t know but I like to go into that kind of research. But, here is the explanation from the

investopedia.com. It says ‘the idea behind this theory is that shorter skirts tend to appear in times when general

consumer confidence an excitement is high, meaning that markets are bullish. In contrast the theory says long

skirts are worn more in times of fear and general gloom indicating things are bearish.’ So to you, what are you

looking at? What are you hoping for?

TONY ABBOTT:

Less bare flesh I suppose. Is that what they mean when they say bearish? Isn’t it amazing what they’re bearing

today?

MIKE O’LOUGHLIN:

Isn’t it amazing when journalists can come up, you must love the fact that journalists come up with a lot of that. I

thought that was just very funny to judge our economic gloom or doom by the short of a skirt.

TONY ABBOTT:

But, I guess there is something to it. Because confidence is the key to economic success and I suppose when

you are feeling confident and daring you tend to present yourself in a different way. So, I don’t think it’s complete

nonsense although I don’t think it’s especially scientific.

WARREN ENTSCH:

What do the men do, come back in shorts and long white socks?

MIKE O’LOUGHLIN:

If you wear a safari suit again I will die. Well listen I’ve got to say, Tony Abbott, I know you’ve got a busy

schedule. Thank you so much for joining us in the studio, it’s a pleasure to find out a little bit more about your

good self, and Warren of course you’ve got a raft of things we can discuss over the weeks.

WARREN ENTSCH:

You better believe it.

MIKE O’LOUGHLIN:

So thank you so much for joining us in the studio.

TONY ABBOTT:

Thanks Mike, it’s been a pleasure to be here.
