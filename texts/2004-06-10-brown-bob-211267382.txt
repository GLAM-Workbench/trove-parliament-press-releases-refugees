Garrett an exciting prospect for politics -  Greens

10th Jun 04





Peter Garrett's emergence as Labor's candidate for Kingsford Smith  adds an element of excitement for the wider Australian electorate,  Greens Senator Bob Brown said today.





"As a friend, I wish Peter great success. His arrival on the political  stage will highlight major Greens issues shunned by both big parties  until now, such as the massive destruction of Tasmania's forests and  wildlife, the need to fund public health and education instead of tax  cuts and the need to close refugee detention camps including  Christmas Island and Nauru," Senator Brown said.

"In Kingsford Smith residents have been campaigning for Botany Bay  and against the truck traffic through the local suburbs which will be  generated by Labor's expanded container terminal - there's a first-up  local test. The Greens candidate will be announced soon," Senator  Brown said.
