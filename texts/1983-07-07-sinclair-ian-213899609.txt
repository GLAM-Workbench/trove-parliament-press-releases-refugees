PRESS RELEASE BY THE RT HON. IAN SINCLAIR, MEMBER FOR NEW  ENGLAND AND SHADOW MINISTER FOR DEFENCE, 7 JULY 1983.

AUSTRALIA AND AN2US

Foreign Minister Bill Hayden*s comments this week that Australia's

relations with Asia are more important than those with ANZUS raise

a serious question as to the guenuineness of Prime Minister Hawke’s

comments in the United States a few weeks ago.

Both the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister, wherever they

might be, seem prepared to make statements designed to fall happily

on the ears of their overseas listeners,  Yet our ANZUS

relationship is far too important for the equivocation now

apparent to be allowed to continue, particularly with the *

annual ANZUS Council Meeting scheduled for Washington on 20 July.

My Hayden's shuttle is no doubt a palliative for Labor’s left.

His statements that relations with Asia are more important, should

be read in the context of his being prepared to alienate the

ASEAN countries by bringing Australia closer to Vietnam.

In its economic dependence on the Soviet Union and its military

occupation of Cambodia and Laos, Vietnam is seen by ASEAN and

the United States as pursuing policies inimical to stability

in our region.

It was because of the continued presence of large numbers of

Vietnamese forces in Cambodia and Laos and as a result of military

incursions into refugee settlements in Thailand, that the ASEAN

countries took their strong stand against Vietnam.

Mr Hayden would serve Australia's interests better had he

maintained commonality with ASEAN and the United states instead

of moving ahead of other countries in our region to accommodate

Vietnam.

If Mr Hayden's comments on ANZUS are accurately reported it seems

the rapport with the United States which Mr Hawke is said to have

established will prove as ephemeral as his policy commitment to

reduce taxation.
