Wed, 13th January 2010   BOATS CLOSING IN ON AUSTRALIA'S SHORES

Mr Michael Keenan MP   Shadow Minister for Justice and Customs

Early this morning the fifth boat to arrive this year was intercepted merely five  nautical miles north of Christmas Island by HMAS Bathurst, operating under  the control of Border Protection Command (BPC).

“The fact that the boats are arriving closer to Christmas Island shows that  BPC is stretched beyond capacity,” said Michael Keenan, Shadow Minister for  Justice and Customs.

The illegal boat arrival, carrying 42 people, comes as the Rudd Labor  Government faces an overflowing detention centre on Christmas Island and  has questions to answer regarding their special deal promised to the Oceanic  Viking asylum seekers.

“In previous years under the Coalition’s border protection system we had  virtually brought people smuggling to a halt; there were very few boats.

“We now have a flood of boat arrivals as a direct result of the weakening of  our border protection policies since Rudd Labor came to power.

“With the constant stream of boat arrivals and the botched special deal given  to the Oceanic Viking asylum seekers, the Australian people are entitled to  worry that Mr Rudd has lost control of Australia’s borders and breached our  national security,” Mr Keenan said.
