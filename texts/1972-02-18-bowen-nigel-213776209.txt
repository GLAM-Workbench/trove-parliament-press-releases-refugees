The Foreign Minister, Mr Nigel Bowen, today announced that

Australia's first major shipment of aid, direct to the new state of

Bangla Desh, would leave Australia at the end of February.

milk powder, powdered egg, medical supplies and corrugated iron sheets,

valued at about- dollars 7 0 0 ,0 0 0 ,

Mr Bowen said that until now it had not been possible to

arrange shipping direct to Bangla Desh, because of the recent fighting

there and the blockade and mining of ports ,although medical supplies  had been flown to Dacca in January In making the announcement, Mr Bowen also released details of

Australia's aid already supplied to refugees from Bangla Desh and

continuing aid for the new nation.

Ã¢ÂÂ   He recalled that in October, Australia had increased her aid

to a total of dollars 5Â»5 million "for the relief of distress in the

region as part of the broad international effort".

Of this amount, the Government had so far.supplied, or firmly

committed, aid valued at more than dollars 4,8 million to displaced

persons in both India and Bangla Desh,

The balance 'vould be used to supply priority relief items for

Bangla Desh the Minister said. Priorities were at present being

discussed with the Bangla Desh Government and United Nations officials.

The Minister said he hoped to make an early announcement on details,

Mr Bowen pointed out that when announcing Australia's recogniÂ­

tion of Bangla Desh, on 31 January, he had said Australia would bear

the needs of Bangla Desh in mind when framing future aid programmes.

The Government was actively considering Bangla Desh’s future long-term

needs.

He emphasised that the type and amounts of goods supplied and

the means of delivery, were determined after the Australian Mission

concerned had consulted with Indian, Bangla Desh and United Nations

officials on the spot. These officials were in the best position to

assess the most urgent needs and to accord priorities.

Australia's offer of aid had been prompt, '  Mr Bowen said -

the Bangla Desh Minister for Rehabilitation recently said of

Australian aid "he gives twice - who gives quickly".

One of the most successful forms of Australian aid had been

heavy duty plastic sheeting, used as shelter material. Seven million

square feet of this sheeting, originally supplied to refugee camps,

had provided shelter for up to a million people. Some of it was being

moved from India into Bangla Desh, where former refugees were resettling.

blankets to the area, ,  the Government had arranged the air-freignting of

81,000 blankets supplied by UNICEF and AUSTCARE, Mr Bowen listed details
