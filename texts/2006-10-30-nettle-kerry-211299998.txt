Kerry Nettle, Senator for New South Wales



$225,000 to transfer Burmese asylum seekers to Nauru

Senator Nettle, Monday, 30th October 2006

Responding to a question by Australian Greens Senator Nettle, a Department of  Immigration official told the Senate Estimates hearing today that it cost $225,000 to  charter a plane to take seven Burmese asylum seekers to Nauru.

"This horrendous waste of money is yet another reason to shut down off-shore  processing of asylum seekers," said Senator Nettle.

"The government does not seem to know what it is doing with these asylum seekers.  They've just flown them to Nauru courtesy of the Australian tax payer until they work  out what they will do.

"Minister Vanstone must justify what value the Australian people get for that  $225,000.

"These asylum seekers should have had their claims assessed on Christmas Island or  in Australia.

"The Greens call on the government to assess their claims within 90 days rather than  leave them on Nauru for years like past asylum seekers."
