TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH ANDREW GEOGHEGAN

Subject: Libya, Egypt transition to democracy



E & O E - PROOF ONLY



ANDREW GEOGHEGAN: Let's go back to our top story now, the crisis in Libya. It's been  discussed at a meeting of the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva.

Foreign Minister Kevin Rudd has just emerged from consultations with US Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton and other foreign ministers. He joins us now.

Kevin Rudd, thanks for joining us. You've just addressed the Human Rights Council. What did  you say?

KEVIN RUDD: The bottom line is this, calling upon, on behalf of not just the people of Libya,  not just on behalf of the people of the Arab world but, in fact, the people of the entire  world, that the time has come for Qaddafi to go and to go now for the sake of humanity.

At a practical level, what we've also done is urge the Security Council to consider next steps  and that includes the debate and resolution of no-fly zones for the Libyan air force so they  cannot be deployed in the future against the civilian population.

ANDREW GEOGHEGAN: How would a no-fly zone be enforced and would that  necessarily lead to some kind of military intervention?

KEVIN RUDD: No-fly zones have been employed in the past. There's a debate about how  effective they have been in the past in other theatres but in terms of the Council taking that  decision it would also need the reinforcement of various other countries to make sure it  worked in practice on the ground.

But the actual core mission is clear: to prevent the Libyan air force from strafing or bombing  the civilian population of Libya. We understand that Qaddafi's air force, while depleted, still  has quite a number of operational aircraft and we know Qaddafi is a desperate man.

At a second level, what we've also been discussing this morning, including with Secretary of  State Clinton and Baroness Ashton from the European Union, is what we now do to provide  high level humanitarian assistance through the international agencies such as the Red Cross  and MÃÂ©decins Sans FrontiÃÂ¨res to make sure that assistance for refugees is being pumped in  across the borders. That is where Australia's also offering financial support now and I've  made an allocation immediately of one million dollars on top of the three million provided  just now by the European Union.

ANDREW GEOGHEGAN: Now is there also talk of establishing a refugee corridor in  neighbouring Tunisia or Egypt?

KEVIN RUDD: Yes, I spoke about this yesterday with the Egyptian government, with their  Foreign Minister and with their Prime Minister.

Remember, Egypt itself has something like one and a half million Egyptian nationals working  in Libya so this is of primary concern to the Egyptians themselves.  Therefore, we are  working along those lines with our friends in Cairo.

I hope also later in the next week to be visiting the Tunisian government and we also will be  looking at ways of financially assisting the Tunisians to provide a humanitarian corridor  along Libya's western border as well.

ANDREW GEOGHEGAN: Now, a transitional council has been established in some cities  seized by these protesters, with the promise of holding elections sooner rather than later.  What faith do you have in these councils?

KEVIN RUDD: This is a very difficult and fluid environment. Remember, we are in the midst  of a civil war. I've spoken with colleagues including the Italian Foreign Minister and others  this morning about the military scenarios ahead. Italy, of course, has a long historical  engagement with Libya. It is unclear but the general analysis from others is that when it  comes to Qaddafi's future it may not be a matter of months but it may not also be a matter  of days but we are looking at the possibility of some bloody weeks ahead.

Therefore, in the midst of this civil war, with an uncertain outcome, the formation of new  centres of political authority is critical.

The effectiveness of these transitional councils we cannot judge but I think it is time for all  publicly minded and patriotically minded Libyans from around the world to begin to join  forces to form an interim government, if not in exile then at least in the adjacent areas to -  to Libya and also in the recently liberated areas within Libya.

ANDREW GEOGHEGAN: Now, as you just mentioned, you've just returned from Egypt.  More broadly, how is the transition to democracy likely to work there, do you think?

KEVIN RUDD: Well, this is a work in progress.

I spoke yesterday with the Egyptian Prime Minister, the Egyptian Foreign Minister and their  Finance Minister, as well as leading Egyptian political personalities who are likely to be  candidates in the upcoming presidential elections, including Amr Moussa, the Secretary-General of the Arab League, and Elbaradei.

Obviously in this fluid state it is hard to know precisely what each outcome will be but the  next steps seem to be; one, the deployment of a referendum within the next 60 days to pass  or to vote on changes to the Egyptian constitution to enable these parliamentary and  presidential elections to be free and fair, and then the conduct of parliamentary and  presidential elections.

The big debate is, the parliamentary elections be bitten off in such a limited time frame and  there are different views within the Egyptian body politic about that and these are  discussions being held between leading Egyptian politicians today and the military  command which maintains interim authority over the country at large.

ANDREW GEOGHEGAN: I mean, once these regimes fall it's a critical time, isn't it,  certainly as far as if there is further instability in the region the consequences are going to  be wide-ranging, aren't they?

KEVIN RUDD: Well it's critical for all of us including Australia, that the outcome for Egypt is  as good as possible. If we don't get Egypt right and it goes belly-up, the implications for the  world, including Australia, are significant indeed.

If you simply went to questions such as the operating environment for terrorism, if you  went to the implications for the Middle East peace process with Israel, the implications also  in terms of such basic things as people movement, forced out from instability in the Middle  East, or the impact, most spectacularly for the economy, on the price of oil.

These are huge implications which is why we in Australia, together with others, will be  stepping up to the plate more and more in cooperation with the international community to  maximise what we can do to maximise social and economic stability for Egypt as they go  into this critical political and election period.

ANDREW GEOGHEGAN: Now, you've mentioned the Security Council. We've heard  tough talk from them. Can they do anything else?



Minister’s Office: 02 6277 7500 or 0466 745 615                                       Department: 02 6261 1555

KEVIN RUDD: I think the one core action from the Security Council, which I think is  fundamentally important, is the reference of Libya to the International Criminal Court.

You may recall, last week I wrote to the President of the Council recommending this course  of action and the rationale is clear. It puts the regime on notice and those within the regime,  not just those who issued the orders but those who pull the trigger, that the International  Criminal Court will come after them.

This could only happen with a resolution of the Council. That was adopted unanimously,  despite initial reservations by some, and now there is a reference for that to occur.

The objective is this: to make sure those within Qaddafi's regime know that they too have  the finger pointed at them and will be brought to justice unless they refuse to obey what  Qaddafi is directing them to do. That's why it's important. It's critical but we also need no-fly  zones, as I said before.

ANDREW GEOGHEGAN: Kevin Rudd in Geneva, thanks for your time.

KEVIN RUDD: Thanks for having me on your program.
