Nauru in crisis, detention camp untenable

The political crisis on Nauru shows why the tiny island state is not capable of safely and  humanely housing the refugees that Australia has dumped there, the Australian Greens have  said.

“The Nauruan Parliament is clearly unstable and should not be responsible for a multi-billion  dollar detention camp with women and children locked inside,” the Greens’ immigration  spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.

“The Abbott Government is giving a substantial foreign aid bribe to Nauru for taking Australia’s  refugees.

“The unstable political situation on the island is just one more reason why the detention camp  there is untenable.

“The Australian Government should be working with Nauru to encourage a stable and reliable  political system in the country. Instead Tony Abbott is treating it like a colony and simply using  our neighbour in the Pacific as a refugee dumping ground.”
