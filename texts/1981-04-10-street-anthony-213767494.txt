AID TO AFRICAN REFUGEES

The Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Hon Tony Street MP,  announced today that the Australian Government will be  undertaking a major new aid program, worth $A10 million in  1981/82, to assist refugees in Africa.

The aid package will comprise a $A2 million cash  grant to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees  (UNHCR) and $A8 million in additional food aid (including  freight).

Mr Street said that the program is being formally  announced at the International Conference on Assistance to  Refugees in Africa (ICARA) which is taking place in Geneva  on 9 and 10 April.  The Conference is being held under the

auspices of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, the  Organization for African Unity and the UNHCR.

Mr Street said that the aid package demonstrated  Australia's deep concern for the desperate plight of refugees  in Africa. While drought and famine were often the major  causes of refugee flows in Africa, recent conflicts in the .   Horn of Africa and elsewhere on the continent had greatly  exacerbated the situation. .

Mr Street said that by joining other donor countries  at ICARA in pledging additional assistance, Australia  acknowledged the generous and open-handed way in which many  African governments had received refugees into their countries,  often at great cost to their own economies.

Mr Street said that while the Australian Government  would continue to contribute to international efforts to  resolve the root causes of refugee movements, it also  recognised the imperative need to respond promptly and _   generously to alleviate immediate and massive human suffering.
