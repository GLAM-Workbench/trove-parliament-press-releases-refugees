ADDRESS 
TO THE WEST AUSTRALIAN

CHINESE 
CHAMBER OF COMMERCE

COFFEE 
SHOP FORUM

MONDAY 
29 NOVEMBER 1999

PERTH

Â

In his letter of invitation, 
Eric Tan gave me two choices for my s  peech today.Â  I could either provide a general 
discourse on the strengths and weaknesses of Australian society as I 
see them on the threshold of a new century “Australia - sweet and 
sour” as he suggested; or I could make a more focused policy statement.

Â

What really caught my eye in his letter was the suggestion 
that this would be the last coffee shop forum.Â

Â

If that is the case, it is a matter for profound 
regret.Â

Â

The reason I have appeared before you three times 
is that this is the most important forum for the discussion of serious 
political and social issues in Western Australia, and a major contribution 
by the Australian Chinese Chamber of Commerce to political debate in 
this country.

Â

Because of this, I intend to take the second of Eric’s 
options today, and talk about Labor’s new directions in national security 
policy.

Â

So let me congratulate Eric Tan on his stewardship 
of the coffee shop forum over the last few years, and say that I very 
much hope it wins a reprieve so I may address you again sometime in 
the future.Â

Â

The Asian economic crisis, 
and the recent upheaval in Indonesia and East Timor have led us recently 
to reappraise Australian national security policy.Â  Reappraisals 
are a good thing at any time - we must always ensure that our polici  es serve both the short and longer term national interest.Â

Â

But at the same time too many people who should know 
better are drawing the wrong conclusions.

Â

There is a view that the lesson for Australia is 
to move away from this recent and fashionable obsession with Asia; isolate 
ourselves from the ebb and flow of regional relations; instruct them 
to come to us for a lesson; and seek to ingratiate ourselves with older 
acquaintances, many of whom have long abandoned any notion of a special 
relationship with us.Â

Â

It is common sense to broaden your relationships.Â  
We did it diligently in office.Â  It is foolhardy to adopt a studied 
indifference to the region in which your security is determined.

Â

The recent referendum campaign showed that John Howard 
still hankers after the colonial order of the 1950s, rather than facing 
the challenges (like Britain is doing in Europe) of engagement with 
your own region.Â

Â

Mr Howard was almost unique among the prominent “no” 
campaigners in having defence of an outdated relationship as the core 
of his rationale, rather than a preferred model for a republic.Â  
He is now engaging in much rewriting of history regarding the reasons 
for the referendum defeat.

Â

Like many Australians, I was somewhat offended by 
Mr Howard’s cheerful entertainment recently at Kirribilli of the “no” 
case advocates - albeit the ones who were least effective in the campaign 
itself.Â  If nothing else, it was a lesson to the Phil Clearys and 
Ted Macks that, having served their purpose, they are not quite “one 
of us” as far as the Prime Minister is concerned.

Â

Like many Australians, I also winced inwardly at 
the recent footage of Mr Howard’s meeting with the Queen.Â  The 
manner of it somehow managed to rub in the pain of the republic’s 
defeat.

Â

Mostly, this kind of government-by-nostalgia is irritating.Â  
In national security policy, however, it is a very serious problem indeed.

Â

The reason that over 60% of our trade is with Asia 
is not the treacherous political engineering of past governments, it 
is simply an expression of the geographical and economic facts of life.Â

Â

We are in this region; we are of this region; and 
the sooner the naysayers recognise and embrace this, the better for 
Australia.

Â

Having laid out that territory, I now want to draw 
a quick sketch of three important elements of our national security 
policy, those being foreign policy; defence policy; and population policy.Â

Â

I begin with foreign policy.Â  The most immediate 
challenge here is, of course, the restoration of relations with our 
nearest northern neighbour - Indonesia.Â

Â

Indonesia missed an opportunity 
to cement itself in the good regard of the international community through 
its treatment of East Timor.Â

Â

It was seen as irrational 
in Indonesia that the international good regard of their nation should 
depend so much on a   very small province of little real economic or strategic 
significance to them.Â

Â

But the fact of the matter is it became symbolic.Â  
For many nations of great importance to Indonesia, the recent events 
in East Timor still reverberate down the corridors of power and influence.

Â

East Timor is a wounded polity.Â  The adjustment 
to independence against a backdrop of death, poverty, suffering and 
distrust will be extraordinarily difficult.Â

Â

If Indonesia is part of the solution, it will reflect 
great credit on them.Â  If it remains part of the problem, through 
inaction, or encouragement of dissent, it will continue to find a cancer 
at the heart of its international relations.

Â

In President Wahid and Vice-President Megawati, Indonesia 
has two leaders unsullied by events in East Timor, and hence with a 
unique opportunity to redress past failings.

Â

Australia’s interests lie in a successful outcome 
in East Timor, and in the complex task of persuading Indonesia of our 
mutual interest in this regard.Â

Â

Just as Indonesia’s denial of what was occurring 
in the months leading up to the ballot damaged it; the same denial in 
Australia didn’t do us any good either.Â

Â

The fact is we did not do all we could to put in 
place a peacekeeping force to minimise the violence.Â

Â

The government likes to argue it was not possible.

Â

That is not the point.Â

Â

The point is we did not try.Â  In fact, leaked 
documents reveal that we argued vigorously against pursuing such a strategy, 
and with the very interlocutors who in the end were instrumental in 
seeing the force put in place.

Â

What happened in East Timor - the killings, the 
destruction and the displacement - was not Australia’s fault.Â

Â

But one cannot avoid the conclusion that a more rigorous 
and positive engagement with the Americans earlier would have done a 
great deal to stabilise the situation, and - coincidentally - protect 
Indonesia’s reputation.Â  Instead, it is a matter of record that 
the Australian Government argued to the Americans that a peacekeeping 
force was neither desirable nor possible.

Â

Again, leaked documents reveal that Australian intelligence 
information which would have supported a peacekeeping deployment was 
handed over to the US Administration tardily.

Â

In our desperation, as Australian policy collapsed 
after the Timor ballot, the Americans were actively engaged, and the 
solution quickly found.

Â

We need also to contemplate 
why these documents are now being leaked.Â  I have been involved 
in the Australian national security debate now for the best part of 
20 years, and I h  ave never seen such a rush of leaks so soon after 
an event.Â  Whatever Mr Howard might say about the possibilities 
of doing things differently, this in itself is clear evidence that a 
large number of his advisers do not agree with him.

Â

Just as East Timor has been the reason for the cooling 
in Australia-Indonesia relations, it can also be a factor in their restoration.Â

Â

East Timor's future depends as much on Indonesia 
as it does on Australia.Â  And in this sense East Timor has an obvious 
investment in good Australia-Indonesia relations in the future.Â

Â

Obviously, we have a long way to go.Â  At this 
crucial time, our diplomatic efforts must be broader, cleverer and of 
higher quality than they have ever been before.Â  They must be far 
better than they have been these last three and a half years.Â

Â

The inevitable frictions over our deployment in East 
Timor have been exacerbated by some elementary presentational errors.Â

Â

Ideas like the short-lived Howard Doctrine played 
very directly into Indonesian fears that Australia's motives in East 
Timor were not simply focused on the defence of universal values of 
human rights and self-determination, but had some flavour of narrower 
national - or worse, neo-colonial - interest.Â

Â

More importantly, they sent precisely the wrong signal 
to a group of nations in the region whose assistance we were seeking 
in East Timor.

Â

As to the challenge of re-establishing 
strong relations with Indonesia, the work must start immediately, and 
across a broad front.Â

Â

It goes without saying that 
the Australian Government must start exploring the possibilities for 
the sort of relationship   we want in the future with the new Indonesian leadership.Â  
In particular, we must give clear and strong support for President Wahid's 
commitment to pluralism, tolerance, and his determination to resolve 
conflicts through dialogue and negotiation.Â

Â

But it is vital in building a new relationship that 
we not just re-package past approaches.Â  I believe that second-track 
diplomacy - using business, academic and organisational contacts - 
has a stronger role to play here than ever before.Â

Â

We must renew our efforts to develop a broad and 
multi-faceted relationship with Indonesia, one built firmly on a wide 
range of institutional and people-to-people ties.Â  Non-government 
organisations; the business community; and academic institutions will 
all have their role to play with their Indonesian counterparts.

Â

A further important task in deepening Australia's 
engagement with the region is the emphasis of regional political institutions.Â

Â

Let us never forget that in the darkest days of the 
post-ballot violence in East Timor it was the APEC meeting in New Zealand 
which provided the crucial forum, resulting in the decisive intervention 
of the United States to secure Indonesian agreement to INTERFET.Â

Â

If anything underscored the ongoing importance of 
institutions like APEC and the ASEAN Regional Forum to international 
relations in this part of the world, this was it.Â

Â

These institutions have not 
only survived the recent upheavals in our region, they have also managed 
to contribute in their own way to the solutions.

Â

A  s regional economies begin to recover, institutions 
like APEC and the ARF must come into focus again.

Â

They must come into focus in Australia, too.Â  
One problem area for us is the loss of intellectual leadership in Asia 
over these last 3 ½ years.Â  As Greg Sheridan pointed out last 
Friday, our most important Asia-focused think tanks (foremost among 
them the Australian National University itself) have been all but bled 
dry by the Howard Government’s various funding cuts - and this at 
the same time that countries like Singapore are ramping up their efforts.

Â

Diplomacy can’t get far without a solid intellectual 
underpinning, and we have all but lost the intellectual momentum built 
up under previous governments.Â  This will need to be a major area 
of focus in rebuilding our Asian engagement.

Â

Trade policy is another area in need of huge improvement.

Â

For example, this government has dreadfully mishandled 
the upcoming WTO meeting in Seattle.Â  This meeting is the one designed 
to launch the Millennium Round of trade negotiations - to try and 
give new momentum to the cause of free trade around the world.

Â

Back in June of this year, Peter Cook and I both 
emphasised how important this round would be, especially in the priority 
area for Australia of getting APEC free trade agreements incorporated 
into the WTO’s agenda.Â

Â

If this does not happen, Australia will be progressively 
lowering its trade barriers to European goods, for example, (because 
APEC is an open trade agreement) with no requirement upon the Europeans 
to reciprocate.

Â

But we have heard nothing from the government until 
last week.Â  Trade Minister Mark Vaile then helpfully put out a 
press release saying how important the Seattle meeting was.Â  Unfortunately 
for him, that very day the big story was that President Clinton had 
invited 30 world leaders to a pre-Seattle leaders’ summit to strengthen 
the resolve of attending nations.Â  John Howard was one of those 
leaders.Â  His response, as far as we can tell, was “well, are 
the others coming?”

Â

Billions of dollars of Australian trade, and potentially 
thousands of Australian jobs in the offing, and Mr Howard wants to know 
if the others are coming first?

Â

The previous government set up the Cairns Group, 
and led the trade debate through it and APEC.Â  It is sad to reflect 
upon what has happened to that leadership since.Â  We have now been 
reduced to grizzling protestors on the sidelines of the international 
trade debate.Â  Australian involvement these days is not to set 
up or dominate the forums which negotiate in our interest, but to threaten 
a walkout if things don’t go our way.

Â

The second area I want to 
discuss today is defence policy.

Â

The East Timor deployment 
has taught us a very important lesson aboutÂ  the absolute requirement 
for flexibility in our defence forces - especially in terms of personnel.Â

Â

Here, the Americans ar  e the standard-bearers.Â  For example, something like 40% of the 
US personnel committed to the Kosovo deployment were reserve forces.Â

Â

Reserves offer you the flexibility to meet major 
deployments without a large permanent defence force.Â  Our permanent 
defence force in Australia has been steadily shrinking for many years 
now.Â

Â

For some time, we counterbalanced 
very effectively with a build-up of reserve forces.Â  Unfortunately, 
the best example of this was the Ready Reserve Scheme, abolished by 
this govern  ment when it came to power.Â  In fact, you could 
guarantee that had the Ready Reserves not been abolished, they would 
have made up a substantial proportion of the forces currently deployed 
in East Timor.Â

Â

Labor has made a number of constructive suggestions 
for strengthening our reserve effort in recent times, including two 
Private Member's Bills moved in the Parliament in my name.Â  These 
Bills go firstly to the restoration of leave for reserve training and 
other duties as an allowable matter in awards; and the protection of 
civil employment for reservists who are called up for active service.Â

Â

I understand the government intends to pick up these 
suggestions, and obviously this is something I would welcome.Â  
I would encourage them to go further - they will have Labor's full 
support for any measures which strengthen our reserve capability.Â

Â

At the same time, we must not learn the wrong lesson 
from Timor.Â  We are defending - in terms of the Australian continent 
and maritime approaches - 10% of the earth’s surface with well under 
1% of its population.Â  Australia’s defence must therefore always 
be more technology-based than personnel-based.Â

Â

One of the great advantages to us of the US alliance 
has been the assistance in the technological area.

Â

The main issues in Australian defence are not those 
of sustaining a Timor-like deployment - important though that is. 
The Opposition has given strong support and continues to give strong 
support to that commitment, and we have an open mind on its continuation 
beyond the three years identified by the Government.Â  We are also 
committed to them having all the resources they need, and in particular 
the funding they need for the job.Â

Â

For the future, of greater concern is the bow wave 
of obsolescence we face over the next 10 to 15 years among those platforms 
which comprise our key technological advantages.

Â

But we need to look more broadly at the priorities 
in defence planning.

Â

At the heart of our defence planning philosophy we 
must place the reality of our nation’s military geography.Â  Our 
defence strategy must be predicated upon the defence of our northern 
approaches and territory, and an ability to operate effectively in the 
area of direct military interest in and around those approaches.Â  
This is the doctrine of defence self-reliance.

Â

This discipline has slipped over the last three and 
a half years.Â  There has been a return in the government’s defence 
strategy to ill-conceived notions of “forward defence”.Â  References 
to “expeditionary operations” and “expeditionary forces” have 
crept into defence planning documents over this time.

Â

The zenith of this development is the unfortunate 
Howard Doctrine, and the now infamous notion of Australia patrolling 
the region as Deputy Sheriff to the United States.

Â

In fact, forward defence has never been less relevant 
to Australia than today.Â  A focus on the defence of our northern 
approaches and territory, and an ability to operate effectively in the 
area of direct military interest in and around those approaches, in 
no way subtracts from our ability to operate further afield if required.Â

Â

A focus on the defence of Australia is a planning 
tool to make judgements about how to spend scarce defence equipment 
dollars and how to fashion our principal defence operating concepts.Â  
It is not a straitjacket on our ability to act globally and regionally 
in support of our international interests.

Â

This brings me to some comments 
about our alliance with the United States.

Â

The point to be noted here 
is that the balance of advantage in the alliance has shifted in recent 
years.Â  In the 1980s, we effectively donated part of our security 
to wider Weste  rn interests, in that we drew nuclear target status 
upon ourselves by hosting the Joint Defence Facilities.Â  There 
was no interest of Australia’s which would have had proportionate 
implications for America’s security.

Â

Those facilities have the same upside today for Australia, 
but with nothing like the same downside.Â  Our interoperability 
with American forces is a substantial and growing asset for Australia.Â  
We need therefore to be attentive to issues like the technology gap 
between Australian and US militaries to maintain the value of the alliance.

Â

But above all else, we must give the alliance diplomatic 
cover, and this means never overclaiming on its behalf.Â

Â

It should be obvious to this government by now that 
unnecessarily hyping the alliance - especially talk of deputy sheriffing 
and the like - causes needless offence in the whole region.

Â

This happened with China in 1996, and it has been 
repeated throughout the region in 1999.Â  It is time the Howard 
Government learned that the last thing a good alliance needs is more 
attention drawn to it in a way which creates problems for American diplomats, 
as well as Australia’s.Â  The focus in the alliance must be on 
diligent attention to the direct military exchange, not capriciously 
inserting the alliance into general diplomatic efforts, except as a 
backstop in extremity.

Â

A final point I would make related to defence issues 
is that defence and security are broader concepts today than in the 
past.Â

Â

Security is not just about preventing invasion, but 
also many other cross-border threats like the importation of illicit 
drugs; terrorism; transnational criminal activity; and also illegal 
immigration.Â

Â

I believe Australia is behind international trends 
in terms of dealing with these new threats to our nation's security.Â

Â

Our current effort in monitoring our national borders 
is, unfortunately, too sporadic, and too widely dispersed between various 
different agencies.Â

Â

It is increasingly Labor's view that Australia needs 
a national coastguard to unite all the functions of the disparate agencies 
responsible for border control, and this is an issue you will hear more 
from us on in due course.

Â

Finally, I turn to issues of population policy.

Â

I know that many of you have followed the recent 
debate about illegal immigration, and Labor’s response to the Government’s 
new regulations in this area.Â  I want to take some time to explain 
Labor's approach to this issue in particular, and population issues 
in general.

Â

Labor's decision to support three year visas for 
refugees who arrive in Australia illegally was made to support and enhance 
the integrity of our nation's immigration and refugee programs.

Â

Labor's support for a non-discriminatory immigration 
program; our willingness to defend Australia's multicultural society; 
our support for a strong refugee program, as well as special categories 
such as family reunion is strong and long-standing.Â

Â

Since the 1996 election, Labor has also worked to 
promote debate on a comprehensive Australian population policy.Â

Â

We have done so with a clear argument that Australia 
will benefit from a larger population, throughÂ  higher economic 
growth; better regional development; addressing the problems of an aging 
population; and also, I might add, a better population base for defending 
the nation.

Â

The immigration intake is obviously central to achieving 
these goals, and Labor has stated clear support for a higher immigration 
intake within the context of a comprehensive population policy.

Â

I also believe that policies to emphasise domestic 
population growth are important, particularly when it comes to addressing 
our aging population.

Â

Australia's birth rate is now at an historic low.Â  
Without some measures to improve our it, it is projected to fall from 
1.78 in 1997 to 1.65 in 2006.

Â

Policies whi  ch improve Australia’s birth rate will not only 
address the aging of our population in the future, they are important 
contributions to a better society right now.Â

Â

They are not about putting 
moral pressure on women to have more children, or return to the home, 
or any other such antiquated rubbish.

Â

They are about something you 
would want to do anyway - make it easier for Australian families to 
raise kids.Â  And that   includes better child care; more flexible social 
security arrangements; and also encouraging more family-friendly workplaces.

Â

These are all areas Labor is working on as part of 
our population policy for the next election.

Â

It is against the background of population policy 
that Labor made its recent decision to support the Government's new 
regulations on illegal immigration.Â

Â

We believe that those of us who support immigration 
must carefully tend the credibility of our immigration program among 
the Australian people.Â  The best way to do that is to protect the 
integrity of the intake.

Â

Australia is by international standards very generous 
to refugees.Â  And rightly so.Â  It is important that we do 
not unintentionally become a target for the international criminal activity 
of people smugglers, and thus undermine the good reasons for that generosity.

Â

Labor's concern is that refugees who come to Australia 
via the proper processes administered by the United Nations High Commissioner 
for Refugees, as well as applicants for refugee status who arrive in 
Australia legally, are not disadvantaged by an influx of queue jumpers 
who arrive in this country illegally.Â

Â

For this reason, we thought it worth making a distinction 
between legal refugee arrivals to this country and illegal refugee arrivals.Â

Â

I stress that genuine refugees will continue to find 
a safe haven in Australia, even if they arrived in Australia illegally.

Â

On this basis, Labor was prepared 
to support the Government's move.Â

Â

The UNHCR itself stated th  at these regulations in no way contravene our international obligations.Â  
That endorsement was very important to our decision.

Â

Let me also say that we believe the government has 
exaggerated the effect of this measure.Â  These regulations alone 
will not stop illegal arrivals.Â

Â

Sadly, the government obviously perceived an interest 
in talking up the dangers posed by illegal immigration, and in promoting 
community unease.Â

Â

We all know their motives for doing this, and Labor 
regards these actions with the contempt they deserve.Â

Â

The new arrangement, however, is a different matter.Â  
It is a modest attempt to deal with the messages sent to potential illegal 
immigrants by our existing refugee laws, and quite often relayed by 
people smugglers.Â

Â

But let me also warn the Coalition not to take this 
as encouragement to wage more campaigns like this in the future.

Â

Let me finally say that Labor will examine all issues 
relating to immigration and refugee arrivals to this country in the 
context of the comprehensive population policy we are developing for 
the next election.

Â

In conclusion, what I have provided today is only 
a brief sketch of the important national security priorities that lie 
ahead.

Â

I said at the time of the East Timor crisis that 
it would take several months, possibly years, to process all the lessons 
East Timor provided for our foreign and defence policy orientation.Â  
I still believe that we have an interesting debate ahead of us.Â

Â

This is an early contribution to that debate.Â  
It is obviously one I will want to expand upon in the months and years 
to come.Â

Â

It is also one I am keen to expand upon in the many 
and varied questions I know you will have on these issues, and on that 
note I conclude my remarks now to give you a chance to pose them.

Â

Thank you.
