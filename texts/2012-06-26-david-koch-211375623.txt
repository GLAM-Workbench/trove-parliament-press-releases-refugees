E&OE……………………….…………………………………………………………………

DAVID KOCH:

I'm joined now by Opposition Leader Tony Abbott.  Mr Abbott, thanks for joining us. Your colleague Tony  Crook is quoted in the papers today wondering whether last week's tragedy could have been avoided if he  had voted in favour of the Malaysian solution. Do you agree with him?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look Kochie, I think this is a very difficult problem but let's never forget that this was a problem that the  Howard Government faced and the Howard Government solved by putting in place rigorous offshore  processing at Nauru, temporary protection visas and the option of turning boats around where it’s safe to do  so. These were the policies that worked in the past. I think they can work again in the future and that’s been  a clear and consistent position for ten years.

DAVID KOCH:

Do you agree with Tony Crook that it may have been able to have been avoided if you had let the Malaysian  solution go; you had voted for it?

TONY ABBOTT:

Let's never forget, Kochie, that there have been 8,000 illegal arrivals since the 800-for-4,000 people swap  was put in place. Now, the best you could say of Malaysia was that it was a band-aid on a bullet wound. It  was completely inadequate to dealing with the scale of the problem. There were no human rights  protections. The Government wasn't going to send juveniles and women back to Malaysia. It was just a dud  deal for Australia as well as being a cruel deal for boat people.

DAVID KOCH:

So, is Tony Crook a bit misguided in thinking that?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, Tony Crook is a very decent human being and all of us are right to consult our consciences in the face  of tragedy but having consulted my conscience, having discussed this with my Shadow Cabinet, I am very  confident that the position that the Coalition has had for a decade and which has stopped the boats is the  right one.

DAVID KOCH:

Would any amount of negotiation change your mind from your stance? Julia Gillard is saying let's put this  above politics. I think most Australians would agree on that. Will you put yourself above politics? Will you  negotiate?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think the Prime Minister is playing politics with the best of them right now. She hasn't picked up the  phone. She hasn't dropped me a line. There hasn't been an email.

DAVID KOCH:

If she does, will you negotiate?

TONY ABBOTT:

Kochie, I think what the public want here is not more talk. There has been plenty of talk. They want  effective policies. That’s what they want. They want effective policies.

DAVID KOCH:

That's, sort of, I only need a yes or no from you on that. Will you negotiate?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, what is there to negotiate? The Prime Minister just wants us to accept a dud deal. Now, she hasn’t  moved on at all.

DAVID KOCH:

So, if she does though, will you meet her half way?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, if she wants to put good policies in place, obviously we will support good policy but we are not going  to support bad policies and the job of an opposition is not to make weak compromises with a government  that's failed.

DAVID KOCH:

We might be able to negotiate here between our politicians but it seems to me Indonesia is sort of at the root  of this. The amount of corruption in that country that lets these boats leave is absolutely staggering and  when you look at the timeline of last week's tragedy, the Indonesians basically left them alone after that first  distress signal. Do we need to get tougher with Indonesia and say, just don't give us the talk, act to help us  and to stop the boats leaving your country?

TONY ABBOTT:

Kochie, I think one of the big problems here is the way the Government has completely mishandled the  relationship with Indonesia. Instead of talking quietly with the Indonesians, they’ve engaged in megaphone  diplomacy, they’ve engaged in negotiations through the media…

DAVID KOCH:

So, what would you do with Indonesia?

TONY ABBOTT:

…they’ve done the same thing with Indonesia that the Prime Minister has tried to do with the Coalition now.  It’s negotiation through the media. That doesn't work. What you've got to do is show genuine good faith, sit  down, talk with the Indonesians, work out what they can do, what we can do…

DAVID KOCH:

Haven't we been doing that for years though?

TONY ABBOTT:

Certainly, that’s what John Howard and Philip Ruddock and Alexander Downer did. That's why we had the  kind of relationship with Indonesia then that did enable boats to be effectively turned around where it was  safe to do so.

DAVID KOCH:

Ok. So what’s different in dealing with, apart from the megaphone politics, what did you offer under the  Howard regime, the Indonesians for them to be serious about this. Did you give them money? Did you give  them extra aid?

TONY ABBOTT:

Kochie, we treated them with respect. We treated them as equal partners. We treated them as people who  were fair dinkum with us as we were fair dinkum with them and that’s what there hasn’t been from this  Government. This has been a government which just doesn't get it on anything and it hasn't treated the  Indonesians decently and that's the difficulty.

DAVID KOCH:

Tony Abbott, it’s going to be a fascinating week leading up to the winter recess. Appreciate your time this  morning.

TONY ABBOTT:

Thanks, Kochie.
