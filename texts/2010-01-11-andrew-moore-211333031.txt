E&OE

ANDREW MOORE:

Mr Abbott, good morning.

TONY ABBOTT:

G’day, Andrew.

ANDREW MOORE:

Nice to see you in here. Actually, just before we get onto more serious stuff, you’ve brought in a rugby magazine

where there’s a photo of you in what, 1980, mid 1980s?

TONY ABBOTT:

Yeah, 1986 Andrew. I was the captain-coach of the Sydney University 4th grade team back then and Ben

Fordham’s dad John was the editor of Rugby Weekly and John Fordham very kindly has inscribed an old

programme where I was ‘Coach Tony Abbott’ and there was this mysterious ‘Father Abbott’ who was playing at

number one, the loosehead prop.

ANDREW MOORE:

Father Abbott at front row but Tony Abbott as coach.

TONY ABBOTT:

Yeah, I think Father Abbott was the nice version of Tony Abbott.

ANDREW MOORE:

And a nice version playing prop, too. It doesn’t quite all add up. But it’s amazing how life changes over a period of

time.

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, that’s absolutely right. Back in those days I was a trainee priest but I was still captain-coach of the Sydney

University 4th grade side. It was, I think, something that helped to keep me sane in those seminary days.

ANDREW MOORE:

But would you still like to play? You’re still doing all this running and still very fit.

TONY ABBOTT:

I don’t think I’m big enough to play in the front row any more. I think my body has…

ANDREW MOORE:

You’ve shrunk?

TONY ABBOTT:

My body has evolved, Andrew. I was 95 kilos in those days - I’m about 80 kilos today - because in those days I

had to butt heads with some pretty big blokes. These days I’ve got to keep up with some pretty fit guys on bikes.

ANDREW MOORE:

But you’ve still gotta butt heads though. 2009 was an incredible year for your party and look, it looked to many

people a few months ago that it was almost imploding and that no one could see - whether they’re happy or not

with Kevin Rudd’s performance as Prime Minister - I don’t think anyone could realistically see a chance of him

losing the next election. Things have changed over the past 7 or 8 weeks. How have you found not only stepping

up to this role as Opposition Leader but uniting everyone and going in the right direction, which at least from an

outsider looking in, you seem to have achieved.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well thanks Andrew. I think the Opposition has found its voice in the last few weeks. I think for a long time we

were a former government uncertain of our role, but we finally discovered that the true role of opposition is to

scrutinise, to criticise and very often to oppose, and certainly when it came to the emissions trading scheme this

was a great big tax masquerading as an environmental policy and we had been a bit confused by what we had

done in government and misconceived what our true job in opposition was and I think that’s all gone now. I think

we really do understand that our job as an opposition, sure, is to have policies, and we’ll be releasing them as the

election draws closer, but above all else it’s to hold the Government to account.

ANDREW MOORE:

And you’re continually egged on by the Government, by people are saying well hang on a sec, what’s Tony

Abbott’s policy on this, that and the other. Is it hard not to be almost bullied into coming up with a rushed answer?

TONY ABBOTT:

That’s a good point, Andrew. Governments always try to make the Opposition the issue, as if our policy or our

thinking on things really mattered. It’s the Government which actually has the power. It’s the Government which is

able to put its thinking into practice. Now sure, come election time people are entitled to know what we would do

differently but at this stage of the political cycle our job is to ferociously criticise and where necessary oppose the

Government. I mean, if in doubt our job is to oppose. The thing is that we should only wave stuff through if we are

convinced beyond reasonable doubt that it really is in the national interest and that won’t often be the case.

ANDREW MOORE:

Now, I’m reminded by the way that after 7.30, Mr Abbott’s staying on, and after the 7.30 news he’ll take your calls

on 131 873. I’ve always wondered, because if you look at whoever is the prime minister or the premier and the

opposition leaders - now we’re assuming we’re dealing with very intelligent people here, hardworking people,

whether you like their policies or not, whether you like the job they do or not - how two people can disagree on

everything. There has to be some things since you have become Opposition Leader that you review what the

federal Government has done, that you think well, I wouldn’t have done anything differently to that. There have to

be.

TONY ABBOTT:

Yeah, but the stuff we talk about is almost inevitably, Andrew, the stuff we disagree about. I mean, you for

instance aren’t really interested in a conversation where two politicians are just basically patting each other on

the back. You want to focus on the issues of contention because that’s understandable, that’s natural. So, sure,

Kevin Rudd and I would agree on lots of things. We’d agree that Anzac Day is special and we’d agree that

Australia is the greatest country in the world. We’d agree that our armed forces deserve to be supported in

Afghanistan and things like that. I mean, there’s lots of things we’d agree on. We think crime is terrible. We’d be

anxious about the death sentences that have been dealt out to these Australians who were stupid enough to go

trafficking drugs and so on in other countries because we don’t much like the death penalty. So they are all things

that Kevin Rudd and I would agree on but almost by definition where the Prime Minister and the Opposition

Leader agree it’s not contentious and people just let it pass through.

ANDREW MOORE:

Well let’s get to some of the issues then. Now, the new Fair Work system has been described by the Government

as simpler and fairer but I don’t see that with small business because they’re being asked to comply with awards

that haven’t even been finalised yet and of all that money, over $12 million, none of it seems to be going to small

businesses.

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, that’s a very good point. Small business is in a state of utter confusion because they are now obliged, as

you say Andrew, to comply with awards which still haven’t been finally determined. They can face fines of up to

$33,000 for breaking a law which still is not certain. Now, this is an appalling situation to put small business in.

The Opposition has been calling for some time now for a serious information and education campaign, not a

propaganda campaign, and we discover today that the Government has allocated twelve-and-a-half million

dollars for an education campaign but $10 million is to go to a trade union education body.

Now, unions have a very low representation amongst the small business workforce and it’s just typical of this

Government’s real infatuation with the union movement, I guess the fact that they’re so beholden to the union

movement that this $10 million isn’t going to educate small business - it’s basically a gift to the union movement.

ANDREW MOORE:

Well, there’s no doubt going to be an increase in breaches from small businesses in particular. Should the

Government cut them some slack?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I think that’s really important. I think that for the first few months of this new system, particularly where we

have yet to finalise these awards which business is obliged by law to comply with, yes, inadvertent breaches

certainly should not attract penalties because really it’s the Government’s fault that small business doesn’t know

exactly what law at this time it has to comply with.

ANDREW MOORE:

Well, let’s get onto taxes for a moment and Australia’s ability to fund, well, billions of dollars in much needed

infrastructure could be at risk because of tax rulings to crack down on private equity raiders. Is that a concern?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, you’ve got to find a balance here, Andrew. On the one hand people have got to pay their fair share of tax.

On the other hand we don’t want to scare away much-needed foreign investment. So it is a question of finding

the balance. My understanding is that the tax office has brought down a couple of draft rulings. The private equity

people are unhappy with these draft rulings. I think there’s still a fair way to go and let’s just wait and see how this

plays out, but in the end it is a question of balance.

ANDREW MOORE:

The issue of whaling. Now this is one of those that we were discussing in general terms earlier about what would

you do? The whaling thing… Now, Kevin Rudd and Peter Garrett were very vocal about this just leading up to the

election, saying that they would take a very strong action against this, they would take legal action. They are now

going for the diplomatic approach. We’ve seen the dramas that’s been happening in the Antarctic over the past

week or so.

What is your position? Do you have an official position on this, because many people are saying, well, get the

Navy in there. If this is regarded as Australian waters by Australia, go in and make sure the right thing’s being

done.

TONY ABBOTT:

I think that’s a pretty fair instinct, Andrew. Now, the Oceanic Viking, until recently unfortunately detained up there

in Indonesia, as I understand it is available to be deployed down into the Southern Ocean. That is its main job, as

a kind of fisheries protection vessel. It should be deployed to this area. It should be there to try to ensure that

Australia at least has a presence in this trouble spot and is able to work out exactly who is doing what.

At the moment you’ve got two conflicting stories. You’ve got the Japanese saying that they’re being harassed

illegally by the protesters. You’ve got the protesters saying that the Japanese deliberately tried to sink a vessel. If

the Oceanic Viking was there it might be able to keep these two groups at arm’s length, but certainly is there is

trouble at least there would be a third party down there to know what’s happening.

ANDREW MOORE:

Well, we spoke to an international law expert on the show on Friday who said he thinks Australia’s chances of

success in the international courts about this whaling issue would be a good chance of succeeding whereas,

yeah, most people are worried because there are only a handful of nations who accept that they are Australian

territorial waters that that might be a risk of taking it to court. Is this something that you think should be done, it

should go to the courts?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, look, as for taking Japan to the International Court, this is Kevin Rudd’s policy, not the Coalition’s policy. We

don’t like whaling. We would like the Japanese to stop. On the other hand, we don’t want to needlessly

antagonise our most important trading partner, a fellow democracy, an ally…

ANDREW MOORE:

But surely, just because they’re all of that, that doesn’t let them off the hook.

TONY ABBOTT:

No, it doesn’t and that’s why the important thing is to get the Oceanic Viking down there and try to ensure that the

trouble which is currently going on in Australia’s Antarctic waters stops.

ANDREW MOORE:

Well, the trouble might stop but they’ll still be trying to harpoon the whales.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, if the protesters are where the whales are and Australia is there via the Oceanic Viking to try to keep the

protesters and the whalers apart, maybe that way it won’t be such a great whaling season for the Japanese.

ANDREW MOORE:

Well, I mean, the Japanese are basically now that it’s not really scientific at all, it’s commercial use for eating.

TONY ABBOTT:

That’s exactly right. Now, you know, I don’t claim to be the world’s greatest expert on whaling and the place of

whaling in Japanese culture, but, you’re right it does seem to be a hunting and fishing expedition. It always has

been. Let’s hope the Japanese can get over that aspect of their culture.

ANDREW MOORE:

We discussed, I think it might of been last week or the week before, you and the Coalition’s viewpoint on boat

people, asylum seekers, and your general stance is: we will send them back. Now, as we discussed the other

week, it’s a difficult thing just to say and do. How much thought has to go in to what boats you send back? They

have to be seaworthy I would think. It’s a complicated issue.

TONY ABBOTT:

It is a complicated one.

ANDREW MOORE:

How can you simplify your stance for us?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, what I’m saying is that has to be one option, it has to be one of the options available in a situation like this.

The ingredients of a successful border protection policy are first of all you’ve got to work closely with the source

countries and the transit countries to try and stop people coming to Australia. Second, you’ve got to have a

process of rigorous offshore processing of people who arrive in these illegal boats. Third, you’ve got to have a

temporary visa so that people who get here don’t automatically win the great prize of Australian permanent

residency and ultimately citizenship, and fourth, where the circumstances are right you’ve got to be prepared to

turn boats around. Now, you can’t turn around unseaworthy vessels, you can’t turn around vessels that have got

nowhere to go, but under the former government a number of vessels were turned around successfully, because

of quiet diplomacy between Australia and the countries where these vessels had come from.

ANDREW MOORE:

All right, your turn. 131 873 the number to ring to speak with Federal Opposition Leader, Tony Abbott.

[News break]

ANDREW MOORE:

All right, the chance for you to have your say. The Federal Opposition Leader Tony Abbott has agreed to stick

around and take some of your questions. Now already we have a full board so we will keep it to one question or

comment. We’ll get the Opposition Leader’s answer and then we will move on. So, ready to go?

TONY ABBOTT:

Ready to rock and roll.

ANDREW MOORE:

Ready to rock and roll. Bruce was first off the bat. G’day Bruce.

CALLER:

Good morning Mr Abbott, nice to talk to you.

TONY ABBOTT:

Thanks Bruce.

CALLER:

When you win office, you’re not going to have the money to throw around like the present government has done.

So it’s not going to be an easy task but apparently you will make yourself available for the airwaves - something

the Prime Minister has not done.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well that’s right Bruce. I think that it’s very important to maintain a dialogue with the Australian people.

Sometimes it’s difficult, particularly if as Prime Minister you’ve got to handle some issues where you’re not going

to be able to please everyone, but nevertheless in a democracy politicians owe it to the public to keep those

channels of communications open. So yeah there won’t be a huge amount of money to spend because Mr Rudd

has blown the surplus that was so painstakingly accumulated by John Howard and Peter Costello. But, if we can

get the economy working well by not being as tough on small business as Mr Rudd and Mr Swan are at the

moment with these union inspired changes, I think then over time there will be more money again.

ANDREW MOORE:

All right thank you Bruce. Hello Sue.

CALLER:

Yes, hi there. Look Mr Abbott seems to be having his cake and eating it too because supposedly he’ll be tough

on whaling but in fact he plans to simply keep, try and keep both sides apart which means keeping the Steve

Irwin ship away from the Japanese whalers so as not to antagonise as he said our trading partners and thus they

can continue to whale. So how is that any kind of a solution at all?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well it’s better than the Federal Government’s situation which…

CALLER:

[inaudible]

TONY ABBOTT:

I mean the Rudd Government having promised to take Japan to the International Court hasn’t, having promised

to send ships down to stop the whaling it hasn’t. Now, the Federal Government could deploy the Oceanic Viking

in to these waters. It’s refusing to do so, in fact it’s saying that it might send the Oceanic Viking after the

Patagonian tooth fish fleet rather than going after the actual trouble makers that we’re seeing at the moment. So

look, I would like to see whaling stopped Sue, I really would. On the other hand, there are limits to what you can

reasonably do and taking war like action against Japan is not something that a sensible Australian politician

ought to recommend.

ANDREW MOORE:

But in fairness the Federal Government isn’t doing anything near like war like action and your not proposing

anything near like war like action either.

TONY ABBOTT:

But, I am proposing a bit more than the Federal Government is currently doing. I think that the Oceanic Viking

should be sent down there to this trouble spot and it should try to ensure that there are no confrontations, no

illegal confrontations between the Japanese whalers and the protesters. Now if the protesters stick with the

whales that’ll mean that the whaling fleet is unable to get too close.

ANDREW MOORE:

But would the Oceanic Viking be telling the Japanese whalers you’re not doing that in our waters, get out of

here?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, the Oceanic Viking would be there to keep the peace and if keeping the peace means keeping the whalers

away from the whales well then that would be a good thing, wouldn’t it.

ANDREW MOORE:

Thank you Sue. Peter is next. G’day Peter.

CALLER:

Good morning Tony and Andrew. Alan Jones is always talking about this for years. I’d like to see dams built in

high rainfall areas like the North Coast of New South Wales, Northern Australia, the Fitzroy River, Gulf of

Carpentaria and build dams and have pipelines going to the inland - western New South Wales, western

Queensland, western Victoria and so we grow food and we help save the drought. Do you know what I mean?

TONY ABBOTT:

Peter, look I think there is much in what you saying. Basically you’re saying that something like the Snowy

Mountains scheme would be a good thing and I have a lot of sympathy with that because we need economic

development, we need to make the most of our agricultural potential and that means that we need plenty of

water, which we should try to use water efficiently and that is one of the things that the Howard Government was

trying to do with its $10 billion Murray-Darling plan, which John Howard and Malcolm Turnbull announced in early

2007. One of the unfortunate things of the last two years is that the infrastructure improvements that were

supposed to happen under that plan largely haven’t gone ahead because the Rudd Government has taken its

eye off the environmental ball in it’s concerns to tackle the problem of carbon dioxide emissions.

ANDREW MOORE:

All right thankyou for yours Peter. Colleen writes, good morning Andrew can you please ask Tony Abbott this

question. ‘Australian citizenship should be a privilege and treated as such. If anyone who is given this privilege

commits a serious crime and sentence could their citizenship be revoked and deported back to country of origin

without welfare?’

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, Andrew my understanding is that if people have become citizens without telling fibs then citizenship

normally can’t be revoked and they have the ordinary rights of Australian citizens. If on the other hand their

citizenship is dishonestly obtained, my understanding is that it can be revoked. Now if a non-citizen commits a

serious crime, certainly that person can and often is sent back…

ANDREW MOORE:

But if you’re granted citizenship regardless of what crime you may commit you can’t have it revoked?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I think once you’re an Australian your part of the team and you should be punished here in Australia and

dealt with here in Australia.

ANDREW MOORE:

Right, let’s keep going with calls. Your questions for the Opposition Leader, Tony Abbott. Hi Stephen.

CALLER:

Hi there, look what I’ve heard Tony Abbott say about refugees on asylum seekers - and nearly all of them turn

out to be refugees - is going to cause a huge amount of suffering to refugees. I should declare an interest my

father was a refugee accepted by New Zealand many years ago, and I’ve seen you know I’ve known refugees

here who have been kept locked up for years, months and years. A huge amount of suffering, you know under

the Howard regime which was just a huge populist thing. Look, under international law you’re not supposed to

discriminate against people coming by boats, the minority who come by boats as opposed to people who come,

who fly in. And this is against the refugee convention. Look to me this is a political equivalent of pulling the wings

off flies. You’ve got a small number of people extremely vulnerable; you just make them suffer because you can

get a few grubby votes.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well Stephen, I know a lot of people feel strongly about this issue and part of the difficulty of being a politician is

that your inevitably going to upset some people if you take any position other than be a mere weather vane. I

have tremendous sympathy for people who are sitting in camps in retched places. Of course I have sympathy for

them and why wouldn’t they look at a country like Australia and say ‘gee whiz, if I could get to Australia I’d have a

good life’.

The problem is that if anyone who gets here can stay here, we just don’t know how many are going to start

coming. There would be millions of desperate people within a boat ride of Australia if they were to think that

anyone who got here could stay here, and I think there is a distinction between people who come here unsafely

and without valid papers in a leaky boat and those who come here safely and with valid papers on a plane. I think

there is a distinction, now sure if they overstay they should dealt with and they are dealt with. But I think there is a

very substantial distinction between unauthorized boat arrivals and people who turn up in the normal way and

then don’t comply with the conditions of their visa.

ANDREW MOORE:

Thanks Stephen. Look, we had a case a week or two ago. I was speaking to a listener, Geoff, who emailed out of

frustration from Thailand. His wife of a couple of years can’t get a visa to be here and he’s sitting over there

listening to boat load after boat load of people arriving here. And you had the case with those on the Oceanic

Viking who basically held Australia and Kevin Rudd to ransom, relocated within six weeks. They’ve been going

through the official process since August last year and are continually frustrated. They are asked the most

personal of questions, fill out about fourteen forest worth of forms and they can’t get it done and they are doing it

the right way.

TONY ABBOTT:

Yeah, look that’s absolutely right and when you get these floods of illegals, floods of unauthorised boat arrivals,

inevitably it makes it so much harder for the people who are fair dinkum, for the people who want to play by the

rules and that’s one of the reasons why we’ve got to try to discourage them in every way.

ANDREW MOORE:

Hi Martin.

CALLER:

`Morning Tony and Andrew. Congratulations on your appointment Tony, a breath of fresh air. As a professional

engineer I just cannot believe this CO2 con job and I think you should demolish it because there is no scientific

proof that CO2 causes global warming. At present time we’ve got in Europe the coldest winter in thirty years and

carbon dioxide is odourless, its colourless, its non toxic, we all drink it in soft drinks and beer and it’s essential for

vegetation growth.

So, it’s not a pollutant and the ETS would only reduce green house gases by a millionth if you work out the ratio

of the proportions for over a hundred billion dollar tax, which I see as a slush fund. I think somewhere or other

you’ve got to demolish this CO2 con job. It’s like the old millennium bug when the planes were going to fall from

the skies or when all our extreme weather was due to the French Pacific atom bomb test. It’s a myth.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well Martin, I think you make a lot of good points. There are lots of scientists who think that man made CO2

might be having, probably is having some harmful impact on the environment. Now the scientists aren’t, they

haven’t absolutely persuaded everyone by any means and the so-called settled science of climate change is not

nearly as settled as the climate catastrophists would have us believe but nevertheless I think a case can be made

for trying to reduce our carbon dioxide emissions.

I guess the issue is just how far should we go and how high a price should we pay for doing this and my problem

with the emissions trading scheme is, as you say, it’s a great big tax masquerading as an environment policy and

the truth is that without strong action by the big emitters anything that Australia does will damage its economy,

our economy, our jobs, without actually making any significant difference to world wide emissions. So, as I said

Martin, I think you make a lot of good points but I don’t think we can entirely dismiss the CO2 thesis.

ANDREW MOORE:

All right. One question about that and I mentioned this last week. If you are of the view that Australians reducing

carbon emissions, which I think most Australians are doing a lot of anywhere and have done over the last couple

of years, and it’s not going to make a difference to the world’s and to climate change, why would it cost the

average person in the street anything? Why are you going to make it more expensive for anyone? Yes, fine the

heavy emitters but why make it cost more money for the average person?

TONY ABBOTT:

Yeah but if we make the heavy emitters dramatically reduce their emissions, it’s going to cost them a lot more to

do what they are currently doing. I mean for instance a power station that has to convert from cheap brown coal

to more expensive gas is going to emit less CO2 but it is going to have to put its price up and that’s why reducing

emissions if it is mandated by an emissions trading scheme is going to have heavy costs cascading through the

economy for everyone else.

ANDREW MOORE:

Kevin is next. Thanks Kevin.

CALLER:

Good morning Tony.

TONY ABBOTT:

Yeah g’day, Kevin.

CALLER:

As you know we’ve had masses over southern Queensland and New South Wales and masses of water running

down into the Darling River and I’ve been watching the flow of the water in that river on the Bureau of

Meteorology website for a couple of weeks now and at Burke it’s been 10 metres high the river. At Tilpa and

Louth 8 metres and nothing has been allowed to flow down through to say Wilcannia and Menindee Lakes. Now,

just as the… the highest at Wilcannia got to 5 metres, the Bureau of Meteorology has suddenly and inexplicably

removed the logos so we can no longer see the flow of the river down the Darling into Wilcannia and beyond

Louth. They have even taken Burke off. Now what have the Government got to hide in showing us how the flow

of the water is going down the river?

TONY ABBOTT:

Okay, Kevin, look, I presume the Bureau of Meteorology is a New South Wales Government instrumentality. I

would be surprised if the Bureau would be deliberately hiding anything. I guess the question that came to me

listening to you was, when you say they are not allowing the water to go down the river, if the water isn’t flowing

down the river, who is taking it out of the river or who is holding it up? Now, I guess that’s the question. I presume

that there may well be farmers taking water out of the river, exercising the water rights which have been sold to

them or given to them over the years.

Now, this is a big issue. It really is a big issue. I don’t think we’re going to solve it here on this program with a few

throwaway lines, but obviously one of the big challenges for us as a nation is balancing the rights of irrigators to

use waters with the importance of maintaining these rivers as ecosystems and that’s inevitably going to be a

contentious issue.

ANDREW MOORE:

Alright, thank you Kevin. Jane says “`morning Andrew. I don’t want to talk on the radio but I’d like you to tell Tony

Abbott that the London newspaper the Mail was reporting last night that the experts are saying a new Ice Age is

coming. This is all very interesting. People are furious in England as they’re apparently being taxed for global

warming already. Could you pass this on? Thanking you, from Jane.”

TONY ABBOTT:

Good of Jane to pass that on to us.

ANDREW MOORE:

Alright, one last one. Ella.

CALLER:

Oh, good morning. Congratulations - I’m glad you’re there, Tony.

TONY ABBOTT:

Thanks, Ella.

CALLER:

Now, this Peter Spencer and the restrictions which have more or less acquired his land from him, I just think to

every person that owns land, it is against the law, I think, as I know it, to take land without compensation. What

do you feel about it?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, Ella, under the Commonwealth Constitution you can’t take property without just compensation. My

understanding is the same restrictions don’t apply under the state constitutions. Now, that doesn’t mean that it’s

right for the states to pass laws which effectively expropriate people. It’s very unfair if any government does that

and it seems that by passing land clearing laws a few years back the State Government has in some instances,

including with Peter Spencer, significantly reduced his asset value.

So look I can understand why Peter Spencer and a lot of other people feel very seriously ripped off. The question

is what should be done about it. Now, I wish Peter Spencer would end his protest. I think that governments…

ANDREW MOORE:

Would you help him if he did?   TONY ABBOTT:

Well I think it’s important that the principle be established that governments do not change the law in ways which

dramatically reduce people’s asset values without providing some form of appropriate recognition and, now the

ins and outs of the Peter Spencer case are quite complex. My understanding is that at one stage he was offered

quite a large payment. There was then an argument over whether the payment was based on the current value or

the former value and in the end Peter Spencer wasn’t prepared to accept that the whole thing was fair. But the

point I make is that you’re never going to please everyone. What you’ve got to do here is try to put in place a

regime which satisfies reasonable people. The other thing that you’ve got to try to do here…

ANDREW MOORE:

Because I don’t think any reasonable people think these laws are remotely fair.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I think it’s important to try to protect the environment, but if we’re protecting the environment for everyone at

the expense of a few individuals, you’re right, that is not fair. That is not fair. And my recollection, Andrew, is that

the Federal Government some years ago made quite a large amount of money available to the New South Wales

Government in recognition of the difficulties that these land clearing laws would impose on some farmers. I don’t

believe that the New South Wales Government then made that money available to farmers.

ANDREW MOORE:

No, and constitutionally as we’ve discovered that State Government isn’t up for compensation, only the Federal

Government is. Alright Ella, thank you for your call. We have to leave it there. I appreciate you availing yourself of

us. Look, we’ve got a full board there we couldn’t get through. I’ve got a heap of emails here - if you don’t mind,

I’ll pass them on to your office when you go [inaudible] written response.

TONY ABBOTT:

Happy for that Andrew, yeah.

ANDREW MOORE:

Good on you. What have you got on today?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, look I’m actually going to be preparing a speech today. I’ve got to give a speech at the Sydney Institute on

Thursday night and when you’re a new Opposition Leader these speeches assume more significance and so I’ve

got to get it right. So that’s what I’ll be working on until I get on a plane to go to Cairns this evening.

ANDREW MOORE:

Tony Abbott, thanks for coming in.
