Topic: Asylum seekers

TONY EASTLEY:                     The Home Affairs Minister, Jason Clare, was  briefed about the arrival last night and again  this morning. Mr Clare is speaking here to chief  political correspondent Sabra Lane in our  Canberra studio.

SABRA LANE:                        Jason Clare, good morning and welcome to AM.

JASON CLARE:                      Good morning, Sabra.

SABRA LANE:                        How is it that a boat of - with 66 people on

board can sail straight into Geraldton Harbour  undetected by Australian officials?

JASON CLARE:                      Sabra, I was briefed by Customs and Border  Protection last night and again this morning.  Their preliminary advice to me is they think the  vessel travelled directly from Sri Lanka to  Geraldton so they travelled much further south

than vessels normally travel when they're  travelling a shorter distance to Cocos Island or  to Christmas Island.

All of our patrol boats and surveillance aircraft

are targeted at the northwest where 99 per  cent of vessels arrive and are intercepted and  the early advice is we think the vessel took a  much longer southerly route but we'll have  more knowledge of that when we interview the  people that were on the boat.

SABRA LANE:                        Could it be a deliberate tactic then by would be  asylum seekers to come directly to the  mainland and travel further south than where  the Border Protection boats and assets are  based?

JASON CLARE:                      Well, it means a much longer journey, 44 days  in this case, and so a much greater risk of  people perishing at sea. It's possible that the  people on this boat took this southerly route  because they were wishing to travel to New  Zealand. There was a sign on the boat that said  they wanted to go to New Zealand. But we'll  have much more information about that when  we interview the people on the boat.

The point to stress is this is very unusual. We

haven't had a boat head for the mainland and  make the mainland now in about five years. It's  a much shorter journey for people to travel to  Cocos Island or to Christmas Island and so

when we interview the people on the boat we'll  understand what their motivations were.

SABRA LANE:                        Well, you've heard what the WA Premier, Colin  Barnett, had to say. A serious and an

unprecedented breach. Tony Abbott says  Australia has effectively surrendered. How do  you respond to those things?

JASON CLARE:                      Well, I'm concerned. I've asked Customs and  Border Protection to review the circumstances  of this case and advise me whether there needs  to be changes to the way in which we patrol  the seas in the northwest. But the sort of  language that we've heard from Tony Abbott is  not helpful. It's indicative of the bigger problem  with this debate.

The political parties have been fighting about

this now for more than a decade and it's  politics that have poisoned this debate. My  view is whatever you think the solution is to  this wretchedly difficult problem, the  government of the day should be given the  power that it thinks it needs to stop people  dying at sea. And that's what we've been  denied both from the Liberal Party and by the  Greens Party.

SABRA LANE:                        If you have to move assets and facilities further  south now to deal with this, that will add  millions now to a portfolio that's already  experienced a huge budget blow out.

JASON CLARE:                      Well, let's take this step by step, Sabra. All of  the early advice to me is that this is highly  unusual. We'll interview the people on the boat  to see what their motivations were, but 99.9  per cent of vessels that are intercepted are  headed to either Cocos Island, Christmas Island,  or Ashmore Island. People do that because  they're seeking the shortest trip possible.

We'll need to better understand what the

motivations were of the people on this boat.

SABRA LANE:                        Sri Lankan analysts are saying that this could  lead to a new level of planning by would be  asylum seekers. How are you going to deal with  that?

JASON CLARE:                      Well, what we've seen over the last few months  is a dramatic drop in the number of boats from  Sri Lanka to Australia and that's been driven by  a decision by the government to fly people  back to Sri Lanka where they don't meet the  refugee requirements. The risk of death hasn't  stopped people from getting on to a boat, but  the prospect of being flown home within a  couple of days back to Sri Lanka has. And if  these people don't meet the refugee  requirements, then they'll be flown back to Sri  Lanka.

It's the most effective thing that we've been

able to do in the last few months and the point  I'd make is this; it's very difficult to fly people

back to Afghanistan, it's very difficult to fly  people back to Iran where most people are  coming to Australia from. The next best step is  to fly them half the way back. Fly them back to  Malaysia, the route that they take to get to  Australia, and we've been denied the  opportunity to implement that policy by the  parliament, by the Liberal Party, and by the  Greens.

It's important that we do that. Angus Houston

and his panel of experts have said this is critical  if we're going to stem the flow of people  making that risky journey, risking their life at  sea, to come to Australia by boat.

SABRA LANE:                        And that panel also said though that the

mainland should be excised from the migration  zone. The legislation is now in before

parliament. You haven't put it through the  Senate. Haven't you effectively brought this  problem on yourself and will you try and have it  passed in the five remaining weeks that  parliament has?

JASON CLARE:                      It's a strange beast, the Senate. I don't have  carriage of that legislation but the government  is committed to passing it. It's passed through  the House of Representatives. We want it  passed through the Senate as quickly as  possible. And that legislation will be before the  Senate for it to debate and pass when  Parliament returns.

SABRA LANE:                        Where will this go - group be processed? Will  they be processed at Christmas Island or will  they be sent to Nauru and Manus Island?

JASON CLARE:                      Well, first they'll be transferred by plane if

they're fit to fly to Christmas Island. That's  where they'll be screened. If at that point it's  identified that they don't meet the

requirements of the Refugee Convention then  they'll be flown back to Sri Lanka. But they'll be  processed...

SABRA LANE:                        They won't go to Manus or Nauru?

JASON CLARE:                      No, but they do have - the conditions of the no  advantage test apply to them as well. So they  wouldn't be processed any quicker than people  at Nauru or Manus Island. But the primary  point to make, Sabra, is they'll be transferred to  Christmas Island. If they don't meet the  requirements of the Refugee Convention then  they'll be flown back to Sri Lanka.

SABRA LANE:                        This group was holding up a sign saying that it  wanted to go to New Zealand. Australia now  has a deal with New Zealand where Australia  can resettle 150 asylum seekers in New  Zealand. Will we be approaching New Zealand  about whether they can take this group?

JASON CLARE:                      Well, that's a matter for the Department of  Immigration. The point I'd make is this; if they

don't meet the conventions of - if they don't  meet the requirements of the Refugee  Convention - then they won't be going to  Australia or to New Zealand, they'll go back to  Sri Lanka.

SABRA LANE:                        Minister, thanks for your time this morning.

JASON CLARE:                      Thanks, Sabra.

TONY EASTLEY:                     The Home Affairs Minister, Jason Clare,
