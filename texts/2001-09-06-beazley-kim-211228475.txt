Check Against Delivery

The events of last week, and the whole question of illegal people movement, illustrates one eternal truth about Australia's future: we can have no security or certainty as a nation without building sound international relationships, and this cannot be done unless we have a national government focused on this task.

As a nation sparsely inhabiting a vast, resource-rich continent in a region of great human need, we need to pursue the best international strategies, devised and executed by our very best people.

Above all, we need these strategies to be directed by a national government focused constantly on the task, not just whenever a media opportunity arises.

I want to spend some time in talking about the issue of illegal people movement tonight, because it illustrates something I feel very deeply about our nation's position and its interests.

We are not shut off from the world. We are engaged whether we like it or not. Stopping the boats will not be achieved by hitting the domestic airwaves, playing the political angles for domestic applause.

A return to an orderly immigration regime can only be achieved by building cooperative international networks. This means working with other nations in a consistent and long-term fashion to secure Australia's place in the world.

Tonight I want to outline how a Labor Government would do that, and in particular how we would work to engage with our region.

The starting point of a successful Australian foreign policy lies in using the many great features of our nation, and our self-identity, to project ourselves internationally.

In the 1980s and early 1990s, we built on the changes Australia was undergoing - economic liberalisation, increased links with Asia, tolerant social values, non-discrimination in our immigration program, and increasing reconciliation within our society - to transform our standing in the world.

Australian national identity became increasingly self-confident, a galaxy away from the protectionism

and insularity that had dominated, particularly in pre-1972 Australia.

A new, more open Australia led to a transformed foreign policy - more confident, more cooperative, willing to develop new approaches with new friends without ignoring traditional friends and allies.

We began to imagine and pursue our own independent strategies for winning a place in the world.

It is to our great misfortune that our national leadership since 1996 has not lived up to the promise of the earlier times. We've had a Prime Minister more interested in putting domestic politics ahead of getting the job done in the national interest.

We've had a Prime Minister ceaselessly shadow-boxing with conservative hang-ups of the past about relations with Asia, UN treaties and committees, foreign aid, arms control and disarmament.

A Prime Minister whose intuitive image of Australian foreign policy seems to be frozen circa 1966. Foreign policy has become an extension of domestic politics by others means.

Well, it's time for a change.

Over the course of the last ten years the world has changed profoundly. This has fundamentally altered the way nation-states relate to one another.

The world scene has been transformed by the growing integration of global production and capital flows, the spread of manufacturing to developing countries, the explosion in direct investment across borders, and the massive growth in trade.

This economic integration has been driven by, and enhanced, a parallel revolution in information and knowledge, with the emergence of new communications and computing technologies.

The last decade has seen a corresponding revolution in the international political outlook.

The Cold War ended and the old bipolar order vanished. With these changes old problems have been solved, but new challenges have arisen.

how to bring great states like China, India and Russia into international decision-making processes; Ã¢ÂÂÃ¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»

how to make relevant to today's new circumstances the international financial institutions; Ã¢ÂÂÃ¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â» how to progress genuine post Cold War arms control, especially in relation to nuclear weapons; Ã¢ÂÂÃ¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â» how to deal with the demise of Cold War states such as the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, or the descent of the Cold War satellites like Afghanistan into civil war, creating massive humanitarian

burdens and millions of displaced persons.

Ã¢ÂÂÃ¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»

In this uncertain environment, an Australian Prime Minister has to be constantly focused on pursuing international strategies that work for our nation.

It is no good to sit back as a mere observer. Australians should be influencing institutions and developments in the region around us, and putting in place the new international networks which will ensure our security and prosperity.

Foreign policy for an Australian Prime Minister cannot be a hobby based around a visit to Lords and a walk through the White House Rose Garden every few years.

Labor considers that no more important foreign policy issue faces Australia today than advancing engagement with Asia. I am unapologetic about this.

Our greatest international challenges and opportunities arise from the transformation of East Asia from an economic backwater after WWII to one of the world's powerhouses. Our security interests are inextricably linked with the security of the Asia Pacific region.

Australia needs to broaden and deepen links at all levels in the Asia Pacific, and to secure full participation in significant regional forums and processes.

Principal amongst these will be APEC in terms of enhancing our economic engagement with the region, and the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) in relation to inclusive region-wide cooperation on security.

We must also pursue engagement with new and emerging regional forums. While these developments are still in their infancy, the ASEAN+3 meetings and proposals for new regional institutions, including an Asian Monetary Fund, have potentially profound implications for Australia.

Australia's aim should be to build an inclusive Asia Pacific community, where nations on both sides of the Pacific can find security and prosperity in engagement with one another, rather than in a potentially antagonistic array of sub-groupings.

Australia must not stand back or emphasise a sense of separateness from our neighbours, as so often happens with the current Government. Even our friends have already got the message that this Government really isn't all that interested in regional engagement. Over time we run a risk that we won't have a place in some of the most important regional conversations.

In saying this, I want tonight to lay to rest the myth that Labor is somehow obsessed by relations with Asia, while our opponents seek "balance" in our foreign relations.

Engagement with the region is central to Labor's international approach because it is central to our survival and prosperity as a nation. We're not obsessed - we're clear-headed.

In seeking a so-called "balance", to secure political advantage over the Labor Party of the Keating and Hawke eras, the Howard Government has sold Australia's interests short. And while Labor believes firmly we need to attend to all of our foreign interests, what we cannot afford is failure in the neighbourhood - and that is what we now have.

Only last month, in the Prime Minister's "seminal" speech about foreign relations, he was still shadow-boxing with the past.

He told us, for what seems the umpteenth occasion, that it was not necessary to choose between our relationship with Asian countries and those in Europe and North America, to choose between our history and our geography, to repeat the false dichotomy.

However, in the same speech he was forced to acknowledge that Asia "lies at the forefront of our policy focus".

Let us set all the false dichotomies to one side once and for all - there are no absolute choices to be made between historical links and geographical facts. The only choice to be made is between the best international strategies, and pedestrian ones.

Geography places us firmly in the Asia Pacific. This proximity often created problems for us in the past. But now, as any observer can see, Australia need no longer be preoccupied with defending itself from the region. Today's Australia no longer sees a region to be engaged with almost grudgingly, out of necessity, and at arms' length. Today's Australia is a multicultural society thoroughly enmeshed with the region through trade, investment and education.

There is today, a realisation in Australia stretching across politics, commerce and academia that to ensure economic and physical security, as well as commercial opportunities, we need a good understanding of, and strong links with, our regional neighbours.

We are in this region, and we only prosper and survive if we accept responsibility for our own destiny here.

The key part of the Asia Pacific which directly affects us is Southeast Asia. The situation in Southeast Asia has changed from Cold War days when its strategic significance for the superpowers was substantial.

Almost all the individual ASEAN countries face economic and social challenges, not least of all, how they become more open democratic societies. Southeast Asia itself now requires skilful leadership, a renewed commitment to enhancing regional structures and a substantial amount of outside support from friends as it deals with these challenges.

The lesson of the past couple of generations in Southeast Asia is that the ASEAN region needs a growing, stable and regionally active Indonesia, in many ways the epicentre of the region.

Let's face it, the history of the politics of the Southeast Asian region since WWII has been dominated by the fate, one way or another, of Indonesia.

Last year in Jakarta I highlighted the historic opportunity which existed for Australia to build a new relationship with a new and democratic Indonesia - a nation of 220 million people, the world's largest Muslim country and our nearest Asian neighbour.

It was not, I said, about "rebuilding" the old relationship. It was about a new beginning for neighbours in geography and neighbours in democracy.

It is to be expected that we would, from time to time, encounter problems in our relationship. People always cite cultural and historical "differences" in this regard, but I think an even bigger issue is the more practical one of proximity, and the way it entwines our interests. So much of what each of us does affects the other. Of course, even the closest of neighbours must expect to differ on some issues from time to time.

Our national interests dictate that we cannot step back from each other just because the going gets tough. Neither of us can afford to put the other on the shelf for a few years. I am concerned that there today remains a coolness in our relations which goes beyond what happened over East Timor.

Indonesia's dignity and self-respect are not diminished by pursuing good relations with Australia. Nor is Australia's dignity and self-respect diminished by our pursuit of good relations with Indonesia.

For our part, Australia is clear in acknowledging Indonesia's territorial sovereignty. There can be no ambiguity about that. At the same time, we must be forthright in urging Indonesia to observe peaceful

dialogue, negotiation, respect for human rights and strengthening of the rule of law as it faces its challenges. There have been substantial advances in these areas in recent years.

I believe that we must look beyond the here and now of the relationship, and look to a time when Australia and Indonesia can work together as partners on the two great issues which challenge us as inhabitants of the Asia Pacific - enhancing our prosperity and strengthening our security. In these tasks we have common objectives - trade and investment liberalisation to the benefit of our peoples; the safe movement of peoples and goods throughout the region; a clean environment; common security in East Asia and the Western Pacific.

We also need to look again at the diplomatic framework of our bilateral and regional relations. Last year, Labor suggested the establishment of a 'Council of the Arafura Sea' embracing Australia, Indonesia, East Timor and PNG.

It struck us then that with the emergence of an independent East Timor and Indonesia's democratic transition, there was much merit in looking afresh at the architecture of our relations, and at new ways of cooperating to manage the diverse problems of our neighbourhood.

We need to build a new relationship, one that shows our recognition and sympathy for Indonesia's enormous challenges. We should be committed to doing everything we can to help Indonesia make democracy work. The price of failure would be a very high one for all of us in this region.

Most importantly, there needs to be a relationship built on mutual trust and respect that will develop over time between our leaders.

Today, this is best exemplified by the vexed issue of illegal people movement.

In the light of our experience with the MV Tampa, we need - as a nation - to do some serious thinking and planning about how we deal with this question in a way that actually tries to solve the problem.

Australia is a good hearted-country, but we cannot afford to be an easy target for the people-smugglers -who are the real villains in this issue, not the illegal immigrants.

We must not allow our immigration policy to be subverted by unchecked illegal arrivals. We must protect our borders.

Labor believes we cannot be a soft touch, but that means having a smart touch in gaining international cooperation.

It means having a cop on the beat 52 weeks a year in the form of a Coast Guard, not just for 3 weeks when you decide it's a problem all of a sudden. It means recognising you can't protect your borders without working with your neighbours.

I announced Labor's plan to establish an Australian Coast Guard early last year. It will be responsible for conducting Australia's coastal surveillance and meeting Australia's maritime protection needs, including in relation to illegal immigration, drugs, fisheries, and quarantine-related issues.

Australia won't fix this problem without fixing the relationship with Indonesia. We won't fix this problem without a year-round dedicated Coast Guard. Only one political party is promising to do these things.

Let me set out my position in detail. Labor supported the Government's original position that the

passengers on the MV Tampa should go to Indonesia, having been rescued in an Indonesian search and rescue zone. We offered the government bipartisanship because Australia's response conformed with the law and with our international obligations.

We parted company with the Government over the border protection legislation it hurriedly tried to introduce last week. This is because it was bad law, may well have been unconstitutional, and sought to override every other piece of Australian law. In any case, the Prime Minister said later he didn't really need the Bill.

Labor offered Mr Howard our cooperation in finding a solution, including support for any specific legislation that might be required in relation to the MV Tampa - but our offer was refused.

Mr Howard mocked an ALP Caucus resolution stating that a safe haven would need to be found for the passengers if they were to be turned away from Australia. Then he spent last weekend trying to comply with it.

If it turns out that the Commonwealth's actions are found to be legally wanting in the next few days, Australians will rue the day the PM refused Labor's offer to work with him on legislation specific to the MV Tampa situation.

What last week showed, is that Australia cannot solve the general problem of illegal people movement on its own, and any attempt to solve it on our own is doomed to failure.

We cannot deal with every illegal arrival in the way we have dealt with the MV Tampa - for one thing, we simply couldn't afford it. In the end MV Tampa wasn't simply turned around and its passengers sent back to the sea. An international solution had to be pulled together.

The issue of uncontrolled migration has not arisen over just the past week - it has been a growing global problem for at least five years.

Around the world there are up to 23 million displaced persons. In Australia, 13,600 have arrived illegally by boat in ten years - 11,000 since 1996. We have seen a 244 per cent increase in illegal entrants into Australia in just three years - driven entirely by a surge in illegal entries by boat.

Clearly, we're doing something wrong. Let's set down a national plan for solving the problem.

A wide range of factors are responsible for global problem of illegal immigration, including protracted regional conflicts, persecution of minorities and civil unrest, rising levels of poverty in source countries, and the attractions of destination countries.

These pressures have generated major opportunities for diverse criminal groups that have become engaged in transnational people-smuggling operations. People-smuggling networks are linked with other aspects of transnational crime including drug trafficking, money laundering, fraud, illicit arms shipments and official corruption.

Effective measures to combat people-smuggling require cooperation with neighbouring countries that are serving as transit routes for illegal people movement to Australia. People-smuggling poses a significant national security problem not only for Australia, but also for our neighbours including Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines.

International and regional cooperation is vital. Labor is determined to meet this challenge with a comprehensive diplomatic strategy.

The relationship between Australia and Indonesia is absolutely critical in addressing this problem. I am sure that the Australian ministerial mission to Jakarta this week will secure fine words. Labor will of course support sensible measures agreed between the governments consistent with the framework I am outlining tonight. But in a country facing a multitude of challenges, why should we have any confidence that these words will mean anything at all, given the ongoing difficulties in the relationship.

The failure of the Prime Minister to reach President Megawati on the telephone this week spoke volumes.

A Labor Government will pursue the issue of people-smuggling with the highest levels of the Indonesian Government. We will do so in the context of a wholehearted commitment to build a mutually beneficial relationship with the new Indonesia.

Labor will seek a comprehensive agreement with Indonesia to extend bilateral cooperation against people-smuggling. This will be accompanied by increased technical support for Indonesian law enforcement authorities to disrupt people-smuggling operations and additional assistance to Indonesia for maritime surveillance.

We should seek Indonesian agreement to accepting the return of vessels and people who are trying to use Indonesian territory as a jumping off point to illegally enter Australia. At the same time Australia must be prepared to help Indonesia deal with the humanitarian aspects of this problem.

We must put a great deal more effort into encouraging the international community to find homes for those people in Indonesia who have been assessed by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to be genuine refugees. Australia must be prepared to accept our fair share of this responsibility within the Government's existing humanitarian program.

Efforts to combat people-smuggling must be pursued on a regional basis. A Labor Government will appoint a Special Australian Representative to promote regional action on people-smuggling issues. The appointment of a senior Australian diplomat to this full-time role will provide a powerful focus for Australia's efforts to improve regional cooperation.

A Labor Government will put the issue of people-smuggling firmly on the agenda in Australia's regional security dialogues - bilaterally and at the ASEAN Regional Forum. The ARF has in recent years expanded the scope of its dialogue to cover transnational crime issues including drug trafficking, arms smuggling and piracy. Greater attention must be given to people-smuggling and refugee issues across the region.

As a major initiative, the Special Representative will explore the potential for convening an Asia-Pacific Summit focused on the question of combating people-smuggling.

A regional Summit involving Heads of Government, Foreign Ministers, and Ministers responsible for Immigration and Law Enforcement, together with UNHCR, other UN agencies and relevant experts would provide a valuable forum to develop a comprehensive framework for cooperation. Australia should be prepared to fund such a conference and related meetings of technical experts in 2002-2003.

The issue of illegal people movement is a terrible problem around the globe - and this is something that

is not often understood in Australia.

Take Italy, with 400,000 displaced Albanians. Or Europe, generally, which has witnessed huge surges of migration from Africa and Asia, and the displacement of sometimes whole populations in the Balkans. Or Pakistan, playing host to 3 million displaced people. Convincing others of the sense of urgency that Australians feel about the security of our borders requires a high order diplomatic exercise.

What is therefore needed is a boost in our intelligence and diplomatic efforts in places where we may, traditionally, have had a limited presence.

These countries include Jordan, Iran and Pakistan. If we seriously want to deal with people-smuggling we need better relations with them. And when they understand us, we are more likely to get the agreements we need.

We understand that any long-term solution to the problems of people-smuggling depends, in part, on assisting other countries to overcome their serious economic and social problems.

Labor will make targeted aid contributions and settlement support to countries of first asylum. This will help reduce the number of people who illegally make their way to Australia. A Labor Government will further increase Australia's contributions to assist the UNHCR in processing Afghani, Iraqi and other refugees in transit countries such as Indonesia and Pakistan.

The full details of all these foreign policy initiatives will be announced before the election.

In addition to these diplomatic strategies, we need to address other dimensions of the problem as part of a comprehensive plan, including:

Combating the transnational crime which lies at the heart of people-smuggling and; Ã¢ÂÂÃ¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â» Enhancing in a sustainable way our border protection through the establishment of an Australian Coast Guard - we must show the people-smugglers that we are serious about a permanent, sustainable and coordinated effort to secure our borders.

Ã¢ÂÂÃ¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»

Some of the other changes we need to pursue are sensitive issues which must be handled on the bipartisan basis that is so important in maintaining national confidence in the immigration program.

So I say to the Prime Minister tonight: if he wants to find a common solution on these issues, Labor is prepared to work with the Government.

I have dwelt on this issue at some length tonight because it clearly illustrates the problems with our current foreign policy.

There are many other areas of international relations with our Asian neighbours that we also need to get right.

To our north, the destiny of northeast Asia and the western Pacific will turn on the emergence of China as a great power, which in turn will have global implications. Australia should support the integration of China into a framework of cooperative regionalism and multilateralism.

China should not, and need not, become an antagonistic competitor of the US. It is imperative that Australia seeks to work cooperatively with China, bilaterally and regionally, and in global forums. Labor supports a One China policy and firmly believes that there cannot be, and must not be, a military solution

to the issue of Taiwan.

Labor is also committed to a trade and investment treaty with China (not a Free Trade Agreement) to promote long-term economic cooperation.

Japan is a natural economic partner of Australia's and has been a close strategic and diplomatic friend in recent decades. Labor sees only benefit in further developing our bilateral ties, as well as working more closely in regional and global forums.

We must also work with the Republic of Korea, both bilaterally and regionally, but also in terms of assisting that country, along with the US, China, Japan and Russia, manage the security dilemma of the Korean peninsula.

Labor is firmly of the view that we must embrace India, not only as a trading partner of growing significance, but as an important player in global and regional forums. India deserves a greater voice in global affairs commensurate with its size and its growing economic integration with the global economy. Labor is committed to putting in place the framework we need for our two economies to do more together, and this should include more work on the Indian Ocean region, which deserves more attention.

Looking further afield, the US.

The US has a central role to play in the security of the Asia Pacific. Its military presence in the Western Pacific and in the Indian Oceans is a vital force for strategic stability in the broader Asia Pacific region. The US looks to its friends and allies to help anchor this stability in the region - and they look to the US to remain engaged.

In two recent speeches on Australia's national security, I have said that Australia's national security system is founded on three interlocking strategies:

A defence strategy of self-reliance; Ã¢ÂÂÃ¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â» An alliance with the United States which does not require unrealistic levels of military commitment to our direct defence by the US; and Ã¢ÂÂÃ¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»

A regional strategy of engagement with Asia as a means of ensuring our security with our regional neighbours. Ã¢ÂÂÃ¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»

The depth of our alliance relationship with the US must never become a pretext for inaction on the need to pursue engagement with Asia. Our utility as an alliance partner for the US will, in turn, be enhanced by our engagement with - and knowledge of - the region in which we live. We are a valued source of diplomatic and strategic expertise in a region the US increasingly recognises as being critical to its own interests. We can and should be a partner of both sides of the Pacific.

Finally, at the global level, Australia's relations with Asia will also be advanced by our mutual recognition of the fundamental interdependence of the world community. We have a very clear illustration of this with the worldwide problem of illegal people movement.

Global economic and social development, human rights, environmental protection, international migration, including illegal people movement, and global security can be best achieved ultimately through multilateral cooperation and through international organisations.

The UN is the key forum for cooperation at this level. In particular, we must support its work in the fields

of human rights protection, preventative diplomacy and peace operations.

I have sought tonight to demonstrate that Australia needs a national government focused on pursuing the best international strategies to build the network of structures and relationships we need to survive and prosper this century.

The events of this past week are not just an immediate crisis that needed to be dealt with, they illustrate profoundly the problems we have had in our relationship with Asia for 100 years. The point is, until we get those relationships right, problems like this will keep cropping up.

Foreign policy and national security issues are not peripheral to the task of national governance - they are central, as we have seen in the events of the last few weeks. Their effects, for good or ill, define our prospects as a nation and as a people.

Under a Labor Government, the nation will get the foreign policy it needs and deserves.

Thank you. Authorised by Geoff Walsh, 19 National Circuit, Barton ACT 2600.
