100+ Children Should Be Released  Greens Welcome Family Court Decision

The 107 children being held in detention centres should be released following today’s  family court decision ruling in Melbourne, Greens Senator Bob Brown today.

“The innocent kids should never have been put behind razor wire,” Senator Brown  said.

“It is abhorrent that the Australian government did this to them. Thank God for this  independent judiciary and international law.

“The Migration Act breaches the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the  Child - as does the ASIO bill now being backed by the ALP in the Senate.

“The children, with their parents, should be freed to a safe houses outside these  asylum-seeker prisons,” Senator Brown said.
