M I S S I O N  " E U R O P E "   T O  S A V E  OUR   IND U S T R Y

" H O R S E S  FOR   C O U R S E S "

We have received complaints that some of you have missed  out on receiving material from this office, or that our  press releases arrive late.

My two staff members, Emanuel Klein and Victor Boulos  and I work from a 10 ft x 9 ft office with two large filing  cabinets, three desks, a table with a typewriter, and a wall  of book shelves. You are welcome to visit, for there is room

for one visitor as long as someone stands or sits on the floor  in the centre of the room or on the desk corner near the door,  with the door open - otherwise we suffocate.

Under these conditions I confess we are inefficient, but we  were very encouraged by the positive response from a surprising  number of people, by phone and letter, to our first issue of  "In Other Words".

I must emphasise that the words hopefully will be yours as  well as ours. I'm not asking for bouquets (we won't reproduce  them) but comments, information, even brick bats as long as it  is constructive criticism which should be aired for the  benefit of us all.

As we reported in the last issue Australia no longer has a  White Australia discriminatory immigration policy. We just  advertise "selectively". A three man mission left Australia,  destination "Europe" ,sent by the Metal Trades Industry

Association to recruit tradesmen for Australian industry. .

Up to ..the end of March the mission had accepted 503 tradesmen. Of these 459 (91.3%) were from Britain and 44 (8.7%) from the  "rest of Europe" that is Germany and Spain.

I can't say that I'm surprised. I anticipated this sort of  outcome in a Media Statement dated 24 January 1980.

During the hearing of the Senate Estimates Committee, Senator  Mulvihill asked Mr Fisher (First Assistant Secretary, Department  of Immigration) whether it is true that "If a girl from a farming  area of Messina in Sicily or somewhere else in Italy who was very  poorly dressed went to Rome to get a visa to come to Australia

(the immigration officials) might feel that (regardless) whether  or not she had enough money (for a return ticket) she might want

to overstay"? "In the United States, and places like that,  if a girl of so'me dubious background who is dressed in the  latest Madison Avenue style applies for a visa do we still look  at her like that? Do we look at applicants even handedly ...?"

Mr Fisher,:"... we are always keeping a watch for people who  intend to overstay before they actually leave the country of  origin. In some countries that practice is more prevalent  than in others. Some groups of people are much more likely to  do it than others, so it is a matter, with respect, of horses  for courses".

Do you feel inadequate, inferior and hopeless when you hear  that average earnings are now $243.50 per week? You thought  you were at least average? Don't feel bad about yourself. You  are not alone. Nearly 70% of all wage and salary earners -  workers - get less than the average weekly earnings. The

average'person earns less than the average weekly earnings.

Mr Hill (Assistant Commissioner Benefits and Legislation) told  the Senate Estimates Committee on 15 April 1979 that  "... eligibility for allied ex-servicemen (pensions) hinges on  whether they (were) members of regular forces. The situation

in relation to the partisan groups in Yugoslavia, the Polish  Home Army and I think the French Marquis is still under  consideration".

Mr Hill said that "of the 519 cases received, 284 have been  approved and 37 have been rejected up to the end of March. The  nationalities involved (are) ... 11 Yugoslavs ... 43 Greeks, 79 Dutch and 100 Polish".

Senator Mulvihill: "Are there any Italian cases? I suppose they  would be on the par with the Slav partisan groups ...?"

Mr Hill: "The Italians who served ... after Italy changed sides,  would be eligible for this pension provided they had not served  prior to the Armistice. Any Italian or anybody who served with

us in the First World War would be in, providing he did not serve  against us in the Second World War. It is a rather complicated  matter; it is not easy to decide".

According to the reciprocal agreement between Australia and the  U.K., Ireland and Canada a person can apply for a temporary resident  visa for the purpose of "working holidays".Â· The visas are issued  for an initial period of 12 months but are renewable for a period

up to 5 years. According to the Department of Immigration  "eligibility to visit Australia extends only to citizens of the  United Kingdom, Irish citizens and Canadian citizens".

Applications for change of status from "visitor" to'working .  .   holiday maker" are considered only for citizens of the U.K., Ireland and Canada.

It is interesting to speculate on the reason for this selective  approach. Why should these reciprocal provisions not be  extended to other countries? After all, there are many young  Australians who visit countries such as Italy, Greece, Yugoslavia and many others and would like to be able to work in

order to help them pay their way.

Senator Mulvihill told the hearing of the Senate Estimates  Committee on the 15th April that some unscrupulous travel agents  in Sydney charge overstayed visitors $100 for a letter of ackÂ­ nowledgement from the Department of Immigration. They might  even write to the Secretary and the Minister charging each time  an additional $100 - regardless of the result.

The Senator was particularly concerned about the "Ambassador  International Migrant Service" operating from the 1st floor, 38 Phillip Street, Parramatta; the "New Settlers League" and a  number of travel agents operating in Sydney.

Mr Fisher (First Assistant Secretary) said that "... the  Department is aware of these practices. They crop up not only  in Australia but (also) overseas ..."

Perhaps it's time that the Department started doing something  more, than being aware of things.

Here is the latest information in the $49.lm High Court saga:

1) Building Security: A.S.I.O. expressed concern about the risk of an attack on judges and criminals by rifle fire. So bullet-resistant glass and surveillance equipment will be  installed. The cost $1,430 million.

2) Special doors: A.S.I.O. would like to frame the doors too. The cost $150,000.

3) Office partitioning: The originally designed "open plan" arrangement is no good for the High Judges. They want to be  separated. The cost $660,000.

4) Acoustics: It seems that both lawyers and criminals require fine acoustic tolerances. The cost of the treatment  $750,000.

5) Forecourt: There will be a formal civic space where children, judges, parliamentarians and the public in general can stroll  or fly their kites if they wish. Underneath the forecourt  there will be a storage space. Just in case (with AfghanÂ­ istan and all that one never knows). The cost $1.4 million.

6) Fittings:  There will be new fittings eg. hangers ... (for coats and wigs) and furniture eg. chairs for the High  Magistrates, the public and/or other criminals to sit on. The cost $2,031 million.

For those who get that "nervous feeling" about the cost  of the High Court Building might come handy to know that  according to the Minister for Health " ... Valium has been  proven to be a safe and effective drug when used correctly".

However, please don't go mad about politicians during pregnancy  because as Mr MacKellar points out "... certain tranquilizers  may increase the incidence of birth defects".

Social Security Benefits N.Z.

There is a reciprocal agreement on social security between  Australia and New Zealand. The Minister, Sen. Guilfoyle said  that "there are no separate or specific requirements in respect  of forms of identification for New Zealanders when registering

for Social Security benefits in Australia".

Refusal of Age Pensions

The number of applications for Age Pensions refused to 1 immigrants who do not meet the 10 year residential requirement  in Australia were 1978 -491; 1979 - 489. .

Airport Tax

The collection this year from airport departure taxes will be  approx. $18 million.

Established in May 1977 it examines applications by persons  already in Australia who seek to remain in this country as  refugees (including the "Boat People" from Vietnam). The

Committee is made up from senior officers of the Departments of  Immigration, Prime Minister and Cabinet, Foreign Affairs and the  Attorney General’s Department. A representative of the U.N.  H.C.R. also attends the meetings in an advisory capacity.

To the end of January 1980 the D.O.R.S. Committee processed  588 cases of "Indo Chinese Direct Boat Arrivals". Of those  528 were approved for refugee status and 60 rejected. The 60  cases not approved for refugee status have been granted resident  status on humanitarian grounds.

In the same period of time 16 non-Indo-Chinese cases were apÂ­ proved and 23 rejected.

At the present time there are 187 Indo-Chinese refugees and  75 non-Indo-Chinese refugees under consideration by the  D.O.R.S. Committee.

Ms Geirsch, if her refugee status was confirmed, should have  required no less or no more consideration than the many other  refugees accepted by Australia over the years. A case of overÂ­ acting by Mr Peacock surely.

DOMESTIC SERVANTS

CITIZENSHIP AND DUAL   C I T I Z E N S H I P  P R O V I S I O N S :   ITALY

If the "dancing political refugee" Ms Geirsch would have asked  for refugee status, her application - in all probability - would  have been considered and accepted by the D.O.R.S. committee.  However Mr Peacock quickly waltzed into the affair and in this  "Olympic Boycott" election year offered Ms Geirsch a political  "pas de deux" in the hope of rock and rolling the "commos".

According to the guidelines of the Department of Immigration  and Ethnic Affairs, domestic servants are "... not eligible  to enter for employment with Australian residents".

However domestic servants are allowed in Australia "... if they  are (a) accompanying visitors (b) for employment with overseas  Senior Executives resident temporarily in Australia; and (c)  for service with Diplomatic and consular officers".

The visa for domestic servants is valid for "... up to two years  with extensions to an aggregate total of six years".

Are you a pensioner? Have you got money missing from your bank  account? If the answer is Yes on both counts then you should  know that the Social Services Act (Sec.l35W) and the Department  of Social Security Examiners Manual (Sec;33) provides officers

of the Department with the power to withdraw money from your  bank account.

Sec.135(W)(3) states: "Where the amount of payment under this  section to the credit of an account, exceeds the amount payable  to the pensioner, the Director-General may within 3 years after  the date of payment, serve on the bank, credit union or building

society with which the account is maintained a notice in writing  requiring ... to pay Australia out of that account (a) the amount  specified in the notice ... (b) the amount of the balance standing  to the credit of that account ..." (if less than the amount

overpaid to the pensioner).

The Social Security Manual states under Sec.33(2) that under  "Sec.135(W)(5) (of the Act) a "... Standard form (S.A.115) ...  (and) ... a separate form (S.A.116) will be served on a  pensioner ..." advising him of the amount withdrawn from the  account.

Perhaps much more would be achieved if officials from Treasury  would be empowered to withdraw from the Bank accounts of tax-  cheats the amount misappropriated from Australia.

Perhaps you might find it useful to know some of the provisions  of the Italian Citizenship Legislation and its application to  Australian residents:

(1) A person born in Australia of Italian parents retains the  Italian citizenship of his parents. However when he reaches  adult age he may renounce his Italian citizenship (Art.7).

(2) A person loses his Italian citizenship when spontaneously  acquiring a foreign citizenship and establishing residence  overseas (Art.8).

6.

T E M P O R A R Y   R E S I D E N C E  V I S A S

C O M P E T I T I O N

(3) A person who applied for and was granted Australian  citizenship can reacquire Italian citizenship

(a) if he serves in the Italian armed forces or accepts  State employment (Art.9) by renouncing Australian  citizenship

(b) on request within 24 hours if he makes a declaration  renouncing his Australian citizenship (Art.9)

(c) immediately (on request) from the captain of any ship  flying the Italian flag (Art.8) if at the same time  renouncing Australian citizenship

(d) automatically after two years residence in Italy (Art9(3))  without having to renounce Australian citizenship.

Therefore an ex-Italian citizen returning to Italy and staying  there for a period of 24 months automatically regains Italian  citizenship without having to renounce Australian citizenship  and so is able to return to Australia holding both Italian and  Australian citizenship.

Not many know that a large number of highly qualified people are  allowed to work in Australia each year, outside the guidelines  that apply to other "mortals". These people are true'migrants'  moving from country to country in search of a $60,000 job. It's  not just a "few smart Alecs" for we are talking of tens of

thousands of people who occupy each year the "upper echelons"  of Australian industry, universities, sports, entertainment and  research institutes.

These people are allowed in to Australia on a "Temporary resident  visa" which is valid for an initial period of 2 years and it is  renewable each year thereafter. These visas are issued to:

1. Teachers (from Britain, U.S.A. and Canada) 2. Domestic servants 3. Entertainers .

4. Company executives 5. Senior management personnel 6. Sportsmen 7. Staff for educational and research institutions 8. Professional and technical workers with special expertise

9. Working holiday makers from U.K., Canada and Ireland 10. Students

and of course their dependants.

THE UNEMPLOYED

"WORLD SERIES" I.M1.B.C.

Q U E S T I O N S

A copy of David Denholm's "Colonial Australians" donated by  the National ALP Secretariat will be presented to MrrGerussi  shortly.

I also would like to thank Mr Gerussi for his letter in which  he emphasised that "the many examples of 'Mal-administration'  need to be publicised "especially when this concerns our  increasingly 'Multicultural Australia'!

I would like to remind the prospective "viewers" and "listeners"  of the newly established Multicultural Travelling circus*that  Mr Gyngell the director of the I.M.B.C. will inject multiÂ­ cultural television with an "A-Class" taste - his own.

I would like to quote from an interview with Mr Gyngell that  appeared on 3 January 1977 in The National Times.

" A lot of so-called A-class people in the socio-economic  groups - the 20 per cent of the population who have a  stimulating job - would like watching the A.B.C. because  they are more interested in the real world. That 20 per  cent is important, so let the A.B.C. air to them. Leave  the Commercials to air to the rest - the people for whom

the working week is time to fill in between the weekends,  who have boring jobs and who don't like their wives  because they got married for the wrong reasons before  the advent of the pill. There is no romance in their

lives - she has varicose veins, her hair is in curlers, —  she smokes and he's not too attractive either. They need  escape to get away from the humdrum".

Figures released for March 1980 show that 19% of the immigrants  who arrived in the last year (March 1979/80) are unemployed.   Figures show that 9% of the immigrants who arrived in the last  10 years are unemployed.

The national unemployment rate for March 1980 is 6.2%.

According to an article in the "Financial Review" of the 28  April 1980 the Gynge11-Martin-Barre11 "World Series" I.M.B.C.  has set up their headquarters in the $200 a night Dorchester  Hotel in London.

And why not? After all, they have $4 million to spend on what  the article calls a "European TV program - buying spree for  Australia's new Independent and Multicultural Broadcasting  Corporation".

Short of having had some "mousaka" in the "Pizza Hut" what  knowledge do these gentlemen have of the needs, aspirations and  the wishes of the ethnic communities? On what basis and by who's  judgment are they going to purchase programs in Cannes, Montreux  or London? In what way does the "Dorchester taste" reflect  multiculturalism in Australia?

We have been concerned for sometime about the question Of equality  of access to information.

8.

Non-rEnglish speaking immigrants who have a query would find it  difficult to communicate their wishes in the absence of biÂ­ lingual professional and/or counter staff. Consequently, the  immigrant is left in a position where he or she is unable to gain  access to services that are supposed to be available to all.

To help us in the formulation of policies for reform in this area  and in order to try and raise (we hope) Ministers and Departments  awareness of the needs in that area, we have put a question to all  Ministers asking them whether or not their departments employ

bilingual staff in counter situations and/or in close contact  with members of the public and also whether their departments  have translating and interpreting facilities.

" I ' M  NOT I N T E R E S T E D   IN WOG T E L E V I S I O N " I'm reluctant to reproduce my own speeches, however my statement  of the 30 April 1980 in relation to the Broadcasting and TeleÂ­

vision Amendment Bill 1980 might give an indication of what does  the Government mean by community consultation.

11 I have been informed that the newly-appointed director of the IMBC, Mr Bruce Gyngell, walked into the very first staff meeting,  stating:

I am not interested in wog television, I find it boring.

I ask the Minister for Post and Telecommunications (Mr Staley)  and the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) whether they truly  believe that Mr Gyngell is the best person to promote multiÂ­ cultural television and multiculturalism in Australia. An

article in the Australian Financial Review of 28 April about  the same meeting states:

Mr Gyngell modestly said, 'I am an autocrat and that is  the way it is going to be. This -That is, the IMBC -Is an autocracy.

I must say that I am horrified to think that the future of  multicultural broadcasting in Australia is left in the hands  of a wog-bashing self-confessed autocrat. I have also been  informed that Mr Petro Georgiou, the ex-speech writer of the

Prime Minister who now heads the Institute of Multicultural  Affairs, has been appointed also to the programming sub-committee  of the IMBC interim implementation task force. Mr Georgiou  presently sits on this sub-committee even though he is not in  any legal sense a member of the full committee. According to  my information, Mr Georgiou has in essence forced his presence

onto the committee and has regularly participated, in the debates  of the interim implementation task force even though, as I  understand it, he has not even been invited to its meetings.1 1
