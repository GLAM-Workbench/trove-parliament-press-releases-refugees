RAY HADLEY:

Immigration Minister Peter Dutton joins me on a Thursday. He’s on the line from  Canberra right now. Good morning Minister.

PETER DUTTON:

Good morning Ray.

RAY HADLEY:

I saw the Prime Minister has been delivering an address to Parliament on counter  terrorism in the last half hour. There’s now a reply coming from Bill Shorten. It  seems, and I haven’t been able to listen to all of it because I am on air, we have

some agreement from both parties on where we are headed?

PETER DUTTON:

I think that’s right Ray, and it’s a good thing, but the Prime Minister has delivered a  major speech on counter terrorism this morning, targeting Daesh and talking about  some changes to the law which will hopefully make our community a safer place and  also about providing greater protections for our soldiers, in particular those attached  the RAAF who are involved in some of the bombings that we contribute to in Syria  and Iraq to wipe out these terrorists and we want to provide some further protection  in the domestic law to those diggers.

So it’s a good announcement by the PM this morning and it is just another  reassuring message I suppose that the Government is doing all we can to try and  keep people safe and this is a pretty uncertain time.

RAY HADLEY:





Okay. I wanted to draw your attention to this because we had a conversation about  the banning of greyhounds in New South Wales earlier by a conservative  government. We had a cocaine bust involving three Canadian nationals on a cruise  ship. I’m informed that sniffer dogs may have played a role and we’ve got fantastic  effort by Border Force staff to keep this up, but if the Premier in New South Wales  and Troy Grant were to have their way, we wouldn’t have sniffer dogs finding drugs,  either on aircraft or in baggage or on this case a cruise ship because they want to  ban all types of dogs - working dogs, companion dogs, sniffer dogs and lo and  behold even sight dogs for vision impaired people, it’s just ridiculous.

But anyway back to the point, they’ve done a sensational job Border Force staff.

PETER DUTTON:

I am really proud of the Border Force staff. They’ve done a really good job here with  the Australian Federal Police; detected 95 kilograms of cocaine that would have  otherwise ended up, you know, being injected into the arms of young people and for  any of us who are parents it is just the most horrific contemplation.

So they’ve done really good work in detecting these drugs. They’ve arrested people  and there will be more detections. We use the dogs, as you say, there’s a lot of  intelligence that comes in, a lot of information that is provided to the authorities that  they act on and the Border Force staff, given the millions of movements that we have  across our borders both in terms of people and cargo each year, they do a  tremendous job, so full marks to them on this occasion.

RAY HADLEY:

A question without notice and I don’t know if you’re even across this. I’ve been told  by a couple of listeners that we have a problem out at Villawood; that there are too  many people in Villawood - visa overstayers I’m talking about - and there’s been a  direction to New South Wales Police not to bring them…because there’s no place for  them. Have you got any knowledge of that?

PETER DUTTON:

I haven’t got that information. Obviously we’ve been able to close 17 of the detention  centres and the population now within the detention centres has changed  dramatically - so we’ve got very few people who have come off boats - but a big  number of people, and an increasing number of people where we are cancelling  visas of serious criminals and people that would harm Australians - and we’ve  spoken about that before on the programme - so we’re doing a lot of work with  police, including New South Wales and if there’s not capacity within one facility then  they will move people around because we’ve got a network obviously across  Australia and then the most serious ones, including the bikies and people that have  been involved in all sorts of serious crimes, like murder or sexual assaults, many of  them will end up on Christmas Island until we can deport them.

RAY HADLEY:





Have you caught up with a story in your local newspaper The Courier Mail today  about the funeral for this bikie that you and I spoke about because you sent, I think  two bikies from New Zealand back from whence they came, there’s a story today  carried in The Courier Mail that police under the direction of an Assistant  Commissioner ignored bikies riding in their colours after the funeral service saying  that even bikies need some sort of respect when someone loses a loved one?

PETER DUTTON:

I have seen the story Ray and I’ve got to say, you know, I feel for the Queensland  Police here because the police at the end of the day need to act under the laws or  the direction given to them by the, in this case the Queensland Premier and the  Queensland Police Minister, and the police, as much as you and I and all of your  listeners want to come down hard on these bikies because they’re involved in  distributing drugs, in all sorts of extortion rackets and the rest of it, and if they’ve  broken the law, they should be prosecuted and if the police have been told to soft  pedal or to pullback or to listen to the government’s direction - and Annastacia  Palaszczuk has been very clear about this - the unions have directed them to take it  easy and to wind back on some of these laws that Campbell Newman introduced,  which dealt with the problem of bikies and drove them out of Queensland and  essentially Annastacia Palaszczuk now has put a green light for bikies to come back.

Now, the police will take the direction from the government of the day and I think  Queenslanders need to question why on earth would the Labor Party allow  themselves to be dictated to by the CFMEU, change the laws - it’s similar to what is

happening in Victoria with Daniel Andrews and the volunteer firefighters down there  - I mean these governments are giving themselves up to these union bosses who  obviously control the preselections, donate the money to the Labor Party and Bill

Shorten if he was ever prime minister would be exactly in that same mould.

RAY HADLEY:

It’s a problem and it appears that it’s a forerunner in a change obviously in the VLAD  laws and I think all Queenslanders should be concerned about that first and  foremost.

PETER DUTTON:

Well as the Prime Minister pointed out in his speech today in the Parliament, I mean  our first task as a government is to keep our people safe, to keep our community  safe and the police, above all others, want to do that on a daily basis - it’s why they  have signed up for a very difficult and dangerous job - and to have one hand tied  behind their back and to be laughed at by these organised criminals, is a joke and I  think Annastacia Palaszczuk should be honest about it.

She never took it to the Queensland election to say that she was going to water  down the laws to this extent and I think this will be a major issue for people who are  worried about, you know just going out to a restaurant on the Gold Coast on a

Saturday night or the Sunshine Coast or in Brisbane; people want safety, they want  to be able to enjoy the community and the problem of course, which was generated,  particularly out of the Gold Coast where these bikies just flouted the law, the  Newman Government did introduce tough laws, they’ve worked and they’ve driven  crime rates down and we’ve contributed to that as well because we have cancelled  now over 100 bikie visas and we’ll continue to do more because it makes our  community a safer place and Palaszczuk is putting the interests of the union bosses  ahead of the interests of Queenslanders and it’s not on.

RAY HADLEY:

Okay. Just back to the other story about Villawood. I’ve got another one that has  come in while we’re talking and I’ll forward it to you so that you can investigate and  obviously remove reference to who sent it to me; it says Border Force will be telling  New South Wales Police no more room at Villawood, so they’re granting Bridging  Visas to people who are three year visa overstayers who had previously been

granted Bridging Visas on top of a Bridging Visa.

Now these are not criminals, they’re people who have overstayed their visas, but  apparently the police are being told by your officials, don’t bring them to Villawood  we’ve got no more room for them.

PETER DUTTON:

I’ll get some advice on it.

RAY HADLEY:

I know that, yeah, I know you wouldn’t be across it.

PETER DUTTON:

It’s general business if there are people that they can house in community detention  for example, until they can be deported, if they’re not going to be a flight risk or not  going to be a risk to the community, it’s cheaper to keep people in that setting and  obviously we want people in detention that pose the greater risk. So they make all of  those individual judgements and it doesn’t sound anything out of the usual to me, but  I’ll have a look at it.

RAY HADLEY:

Just a couple of other things; a story today in The Telegraph, carried prominently on  page three; a man has been sent to jail for three years, a 20 year old called Mufiz  Rahaman for the rape of a 10 year old boy. He told authorities it was culturally  acceptable to sexually assault children in his homeland. He comes from some sort of  persecuted Muslim minority in Myanmar. Now, he’s eligible for parole March of 2018,  has this matter come to your attention yet?

PETER DUTTON:

I’ve received some information, so I’m advised that this individual, the offender in this  case, arrived on a boat in September of 2012 - so this would have been at the height  of when you know thousands of people were coming each month - and so the      view that you know anybody who comes by boat seeking protection or making a  claim to be a refugee is pure and would never harm anyone - I’d just ask people to  think about this again because this is why we don’t allow people out in to the  community in certain cases, it’s why we need to run the background checks and in  this case it’s very concerning.

I mean the rape of a 10 year old child; it’s hard to think of a more egregious criminal  act and I get in trouble for this, as you do Ray, for commenting on judges and  penalties, but the rape of a 10 year old boy - and we’re talking about somebody

being out in early 2018 - frankly is beyond me and I don’t think the community  accepts that sort of behaviour.

RAY HADLEY:

Well there may be an appeal, but you’ll have the final say when he does get out in  March of 2018 or your relevant Minister in 2018, so to speak.

PETER DUTTON:

Well that is a case where we would cancel visas in these sort of cases and people  would be held in detention until they can be sent back to their country of origin.

RAY HADLEY:

Okay. One final thing, Sam Dastyari from the Senate; look there was a very funny  description…I don’t know if you saw this morning on Sky News from your colleague  Craig Laundy who said he now can be described as the ‘biggest political tight-arse in  the history of Australian politics’ and that he got someone to pay a $1,300 bill, a  phone bill allegedly. I mean then he declared it. Now he says he’ll donate the money  to charity.

I mean look, Sam Dastyari, they’re not going to make him resign, he’s too powerful  within the party, but he just paints politicians generally in a particularly poor light.

PETER DUTTON:

Well it does and the vast majority of MPs on both sides of the Parliament want to do  the right thing and people like Sam Dastyari taint the rest of us and he’s had $1,600  as I read in the papers, paid a bill that was issued by the Department of Finance - so  an overclaim presumably that he’s made or he’s gone above his spending limit - and  he’s got a Chinese friend or someone who is affiliated or associated with or linked  back to the Chinese Government to pay this bill. I mean that’s not normal practice.  That is ridiculous.

RAY HADLEY:

I’d say to Sam and I’m hoping to talk to him about it, I’d say to him, you know, if I get  a bill for $1,600, I don’t go to a colleague or an associate and say, ‘oh mate fix this  up for me’. If it is a legitimate business expense I go to the accounts department and  say, this was incurred and they either say yay or nay and then if they say nay, I pay  it, if they say yay, they pay it, but I don’t go to a third party and say can you do this

for me, I mean it beggars belief.

PETER DUTTON:

But Ray this is only…you know, I mean my judgement is that there is more to this  story. Bill Shorten should properly investigate it because he’s the one that has  appointed Sam Dastyari to this high position.

Now, if there have been further payments, other payments that haven’t been  declared or payments that have just been made to him personally, then they will  need to be declared and Mr Dastyari and Mr Shorten need to be very clear about  this. Are there other payments? Are there other circumstances that need to be  investigated and Bill Shorten is the Leader of the Labor Party, he wants to be prime  minister of the country, he’s the one that needs to answer the questions and if Mr  Dastyari has done the wrong thing then Bill Shorten should sack him.

RAY HADLEY:

Alright. Thanks for your time. Talk next week.

PETER DUTTON:

Thanks Ray.
