YUGOSLAVIA NATO AIRSTRIKES

24 March 1999

FA26

Â

The Australian Government 
regrets that the instransigence of President Milosevic of the Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia has brought NATO to authorize airstrikes.

Â

Responsibility for NATO 
action lies squarely with the Serbian leadership and President Milosevic. 
It is they who rejected the Rambouillet peace proposal.

Â

The peace process was 
given every chance, with earnest efforts by the peace talks co-chairs, 
the Contact Group of countries, as well as US Special Envoy Richard 
Hoibrooke who was despatched in a last ditch effort to persuade President 
Milosevic to accept the draft Rambouillet accords.

Â

It is the Serbian leadership 
and President Milosevic who are responsible for the large scale violations 
of the October Agreements with the OSCE and NATO. Full compliance with 
these agreements was demanded by the United Nations Security Council 
in its Resolution 1203 of 24 October 1998. The leadership also bears 
responsibility for the increasing humanitarian and refugee crisis stemming 
from offensives by Serb/FRY forces against the Kosovar Albanians.

Â

President Milosevic must 
be left in no doubt of the international community,s resolve to bring 
an end to the fighting and prevent further suffering in Kosovo.
