source countries as the attitÂ­ udes and population policies  of these countries vary  considerably". Now that's Â·   very interesting.

Phy&iotherapi&ti don't pa&6

Some 82% of all overseas  qualified physiotherapists  have failed the exams to  convert their qualifications

in Australia. Since 1975, 130  candidates attempted the  examinations prepared by the  Australian Examining Council

for Overseas Physiotherapists.  Of those only 24 passed all  the exams set by the Council.

Ov m a b a a  Quali{icatlonA

According to the Committee on  Overseas Professional QualÂ­ ifications, some 5,300 indivÂ­ iduals were provided with  assessments of their qualifÂ­

ications in 1980. This figure  also includes 112 technical  qualifications.

The major source countries of  generalist qualifications  assessed in 1980 were Vietnam  80; Poland 59; India, PhiliÂ­ ppines and USSR each 50; UK 45;  while curiously there were few

qualifications assessed from  some of our traditional source  countries of immigration, eg.  Italy 9; Greece 15; Lebanon 5;  Yugoslavia 16; and Turkey 6.

More than 20% dccrea&e in aid  {ok re{ugeei

The drastic increase in refugÂ­ ees is causing serious problems  at international levels. The  original estimated expenditure  of the UNHCR for 1979 was

$US87 million but the actual  expenditure amounted to  $US269 million. This year's  expenditure has risen to  $US500 million.

According to the Annual Report  of the Department of Foreign  Affairs, during 1979/80  Australia contributed $6.46  million to the UNHCR, of which

$4 million was for Indo-Chinese  refugees.  In 1980/81 Australia  has contributed $500,000 for  Kampuchean refugees and an  additional $4.62 million for

the UNHCR's other programs.

More AuAtraliaM Travel

In the year 1980, it is  estimated that more than  996,000 Australian citizens  left Australia intending to  remain overseas for less than  a 12 months period. Some  432,700 new passports were  issued in Australia in 1980. At a rate of $25 per passport  that means that some $11  million was spent by Australian  travellers on passports alone.

”IN OTHER WORDS” From: MICK YOUNG m . p. Shadow Minister for Immigration   and Ethnic Affairs

No. 7 15-21 June 1981. Journaliiti  broadcasters and other individuals  should {eel {ree to reproduce any  cuiticle. An acknowledgement is not

necessary, but would be appreciated.

Editorial

With the Parliamentary Session now concluded speculation turns  to the forthcoming Premiers' Conference and 1981 Budget.

It is highly unlikely that the 1981 Budget will be leaked to  the press in the same manner that the 1980 Budget reached the  press. That will not be the only dissimilar feature.

Commentators here in Canberra unanimously agree that the  August Budget will be a revenue raising Budget. To replace  the income previously raised by the Government in the past few

years, through the oil levy, it is almost certain that the  traditional areas, cigarettes, beer, etc. will be hard hit. It is highly likely that the Government,  in order to demonstrÂ­ ate that it is even-handed, will include for the first time,  a wine tax. .

The 1981 Budget could be seen in the context of the Prime  Minister's hold over his Party and the loss of a majority in  the Senate. He will gamble that he can make less electorally  popular decisions this year and redistribute monies in the

form of electorally attactive handouts at the end of 1982  and early 1983.

There is more speculation that perhaps Family Allowances can  be increased, with the additional revenue raised in this  year's budget.  I tend to think it unlikely as the Prime  Minister has clearly indicated he is conducting a three-year

plan to reassure his re-election in 1983.

When the new health charges are added to the increased prices  that will be applying on beer, spirits, cigarettes after the  Budget, it is simply to observe that the purchasing power of  the present-day pay packet will be severely reduced by  September 1981. Much of this of course could have been  avoided if the Government did not cut off all of its options  to place a tax on capital either in the form of a capital  gains tax or a resources rent tax.

A  Wanning to Travelling  AuAtnalianA

In 1980 some 199 Australians  were arrested and 264 AustralÂ­ ians died while visiting overÂ­ seas countries. Most of the  arrests and a number of deaths  arose from the use of or

dealing in drugs.

Unless it can be shown that a  foreign country is denying an  Australian the justice which  it would provide to its own

citizens, the Australian  Government and our consular  officials have no standing to  intervene on behalf of AustralÂ­

ian citizens being gaoled or  sentenced in other countries.

The knighti ofr the financial  cMicZe

Fifteen knights and thirty-  four commoners dabble in bankÂ­ ing, presiding over $53  billion in assets. They

control almost half of the  total assets in Australia's  financial system.

Thirty-seven of these  directors spread their influÂ­ ence through the boards of

directors of more than 100  companies.  They indirectly  control assets in excess of

$100 billion.

The AMP Society is a good  example. They are the  largest shareholders in 21 of  the top 100 companies. At

the same time members of the  board of the AMP Society are  also directors of a wide  range of corporations e.g.  Bank of NSW, National Bank,  Commonwealth Bank, John FairÂ­

fax, Advertiser Newspapers,  S.A. Brewery, BHP, Chubbs,  Monier, Blue Circle Cement  to name just a few.

To put it more succinctly,  in Australia 5% of the popÂ­ ulation owns 46% of the total  wealth. The richest 2,000

people in this country own as  much as the poorest two and  a quarter million Australians.

Tatting OveueaA Voctotu

In 1980 a total of 162 overÂ­ seas doctors attempted the  written examination prepared  by the Australian Medical

Examining Council. Of those

2 .

92 (57%) passed and went on to  attempt the clinical examinatÂ­ ion in Australia. 23 were  successful. That means that

there is an 86% failure rate  amongst overseas doctors.

Since the establishment of  AMEC in 1978 a total of 351  candidates, trained in 50  different countries, have

attempted the examinations  conducted by the Council's  Board of Examiners. To date  75 people have passed all

sections of the examinations  and have been awarded AMEC  certificates. That represents  a failure rate of 79%.

Afghan Refugee*

Since the Soviet invasion of  Afghanistan in December 1979  there were more than 1.2  million refugees crossing the  border and settling in -

Pakistan. There are an addÂ­ itional 400,000 Afghan refugÂ­ ees in Iran. Australia has so  far provided $5.2 million in  aid for Afghan refugees.

The Gfteehi a/ie Coming

The Greek Government has  agreed to send to Australia  an exhibition of ancient  treasures dealing with the  life and time of Alexander  the Great (336-323 BC).

At present the exhibition is  touring North America, and  according to my information  it will not leave America  until 1983.

The recently set up Internatio  al .Cultural Corporation of  Australia will be invited to

manage the exhibition. I under^  stand that the exhibition will  visit a number of Australian  cities. In bringing the Greek

exhibition to Australia the  Corporation will be seeking  private sponsorship to the  order of $400,000.

Qualified Tradesmen

In 1979/80 some 81,271, immiÂ­ grants were allowed to come to  Australia. Of those 12,753  (15.7%) were skilled tradesmen.  Of the total arrivals only

6,289 (7.7%) were selected with  NUMAS between April 1979 and  December 1980.

The vast proportion of skilled  tradesmen were selected from  UK 3,640; NZ 3,815; South  Africa 536; Germany 509;  Argentina 289; Austria 243,  Yugoslavia 243. There were  only 175 skilled tradesmen

recruited from Italy; 54 from  Greece and 12 from Lebanon.

A n  "in depth" observation

On p.33 of the annual report of  the Department of Foreign  Affairs stated that "the  nature of our relationship with

other countries and our standÂ­ ing in the international  community affect our ability to  obtain migrants when we want

them. The Department therefore  is aware that sensitivity is  needed in dealing with migrant
