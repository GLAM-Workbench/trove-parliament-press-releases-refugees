Well, I think there were plenty o! warning signs around, I  don't know, of course, exactly how much he knew, but he was  certainly warned in terms of a study that was released by  John Brady to the Building Societies' Advisory Group in  Victoria late last year which said that one of the societies  could have been in trouble. I don't know whether that was  Pyramid.

Hie own Governor of the Reserve Bank, Bernie Fraser, 9ave  a speech in April of this year where he referred to, in a  quite unguarded way, to some of the problems he saw with the  prudential supervision of buildin9 societies in Australia.  And, o! course the Reserve Bank collects statistics on the  operation of a whole range of financial institutions, under

the auspices of the Financial Corporations Act. I think  it's done that since the middle-l970s. We don't really know  what they do with that data, I imagine they use it for some  statistical collections, but it may be that it was detailed  enough to give you some hint that some of these institutions  were getting into trouble. And so, I'm raising the

questions that there's plenty of pointers around to suggest  that the Government was in a position to know.  JOURNALISTs \

And what could the Treasurer have done about it?

HEWSON:

Well, as far as I'm concerned, if you've run an economic  policy the way he has done that, which has overheated the  economy and built the speculative environment and given  people a tax break to go into d~bt, that we've had in recent  years, so that a lot of the financial pressures that built  up in '87 and t88 and were undone with the high interest  rates of 'BB -and '89 and now into '90. Then he's

responsible for that entire environment.

If you look at what the Reserve Bank has said, or the  Commonwealth Bank has said, asset prices would fall  dramatically in response to high interest rates, that would  presumably have been seen' to put pressure on financial

institutions. It's bringing us record levels o! personal  bankruptcies and small business failures and, in those  circumstances, it's logical that maybe financial  institutions might feel the strain and so with all that  background, you'd expect that the Treasurer would have  perhaps thought forward to see whether there was adequate  prudential supervision of all the institutions concerned.  He knew about the environment, he was warned that that  environment would see falling . asset prices, real estate  prices, falls in the value of business, that that would put

strain on financial institutions.  It's only reasonable to expect that he might have done  something about the prudential supervision of the  institutions concerned.  JOURNALISTz

Dr Hewson, how to you identify the differences between the  Prime Minister and the Treasurer on this issue of building  society supervision?  HEWSON:

Well, I think that what happened is that on Tuesday I made  a etatement saying that there should be a nationally co " ordinated approach to prudential supervision. The  Treasurer's initial reaction to that was to say, no, the  system is adequate, we don't need to do any more. I think  by Wednesday night, they'd decided that was the wrong tack  and they had to get him out o! it. And so the Prime

Minister arrived at the Press Club yesterday, apparently on  the basis of an agreed text, where he jettisoned the  Treasurer's earlier position and said that he supported a  national scheme. And I think that's what you've seen in

recent days.  The real question to ask the Prime Minister is, then, does  he support the way the Treasurer has handled this situation  right through from last year? And does he believe that that

the Treasurer has done the right thing? Does he accept the  fact that the prudential supervisory procedures that are  there at various ways in Australia are adequate to handle  the situation as the Treasurer has claimed.

.. (inaudible) .. do you perceive a split between Mr Hawke and  Mr Keating?

HEWSON:

I think there'~ a definite split, and ! think what they've  tried to do is patch that up, a bit of damage control, a bit  of re-writing of history, with the Prime Minister suddenly  changing the Government's mind, if you like, yesterday at  the Press Club.

JOURNALIST:

Dr Hewson, he says its just a Victorian problem. How do you  react to that?  HEWSON:

Well, there's plenty of evidence to suggest that people deal  with Victoria. There are links between Victoria and other  part~ of Australia and, in those circumstance, I think it's

amazing to say that anything is ~ontained in any particular  way. I don't want to be seen to be suggesting that it will  necessarily flow to other institutions in other States. But  it just shows an unjustified complacency to say, Oh, it's

just a Victorian problem, or its a local issue. Sure,  Pyramid is predominantly, is Victorian based, but phenomenon  of falling asset prices and the strains we've seen on the  balance sheets of financial institutions, as revealed by  what some of the banks have said, go much broader than  Victoria.  JOURNALIST:

What would you like to see ... (inaudible) ... I mean, how's  the Government going to scramble out of it?

HEWSONr

Well, I would urge the Government as a matter of priority  not to wait until October for its foreshadowed Special  Premiers' Conference because I think it's much more urgent  than that. They should, I think Mr Hawke should call on the  Treasurer to start an inquiry right now into a national

system of prudential supervision. I think that inquiry  should include Ã¢Â‘ members from the Reserve Bank, people from  the States, of course, that administer some of the building  societies, and noted industry experts, with a view to  telling us fairly quickly whether the present arrangements

for prudential supervision are adequate, or where they need  to be improved and what stepe need to be taken. That's far  more urgent than waiting until late October, early November  for the Premiere' Conference which will consider apparently

that along with a lot of other issues.

JOURNALIST:

What's your Party's policy to solving the crisis?

HEWSON:

Well, we think it could have been anticipated, and should  have been anticipated, and there should have been steps  taken to ensure e!!ective national prudential aupervisory  arrangement, if you like, for the whole, for all financial

inatitutiona. Now, that hasn't been put in place, so it  ought to be put in place as a matter of urgency, and that's  our response.

JOURNALIST:

So back to what you originally said, do you think the  problem could have been averted if the Treasurer had acted  sooner.

HEWSON I

Well, I think it you have a warning that institutions are  getting into trouble, obviously you can take some steps  either to deal with the situation or to minimise the damage  on individuala. See the most amazing-thing is that Mr Jolly  made an announcement about the 13th of February, that

Pyramid was OK. As it happened that was just a couple of  days before the election wae called, and it begs the  question that was done to try and push the issue until after  the election. Now, in those sort of circumstances, one  would hope that they hadn't played politics with the issue.

But, there are a lot of questions that need to be answered.

Thank you.
