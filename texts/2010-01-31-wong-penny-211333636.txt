Well today the man who wants to be Prime Minister, Tony Abbott, gave a speech here in Adelaide - in the driest state of the driest continent - and said that it GRHVQÃ¢ÂÂWÃ¯Â¿Â½PDWWHUÃ¯Â¿Â½LIÃ¯Â¿Â½WHPSHUDWXUHVÃ¯Â¿Â½ULVHÃ¯Â¿Â½LQÃ¯Â¿Â½W KLVÃ¯Â¿Â½FRXQWU\Ã¯Â¿Â½E\Ã¯Â¿Â½IRXUÃ¯Â¿Â½GHJ UHHVÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½7KDWÃ¢ÂÂVÃ¯Â¿Â½ZKDWÃ¯Â¿Â½0UÃ¯Â¿Â½$EERWWÃ¯Â¿Â½VDLGÃ¯Â¿Â½today here in Adelaide, in the driest state in the driest continent. He said that a four degree temperature rise was no big deal.  /HWÃ¯Â¿Â½PHÃ¯Â¿Â½WHOOÃ¯Â¿Â½\RXÃ¯Â¿Â½DÃ¯Â¿Â½IHZÃ¯Â¿Â½WKLQJVÃ¯Â¿Â½WKDWÃ¯Â¿Â½ZLOOÃ¯Â¿Â½KDSSHQÃ¯Â¿Â½LIÃ¯Â¿Â½ZHÃ¯Â¿Â½GRÃ¯Â¿Â½VHHÃ¯Â¿Â½DÃ¯Â¿Â½IR XUÃ¯Â¿Â½GHJUHHÃ¯Â¿Â½WHPSHUD WXUHÃ¯Â¿Â½ULVHÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½/HWÃ¢ÂÂ s look at a few things that will happen if there is a four degree temperature rise.

JOURNALIST: Just on a different issue. Are the Opposition Â±  it has claimed that Christmas Island  is a visa making factory and Steve Fielding says itÃ¢ÂÂVÃ¯Â¿Â½WRRÃ¯Â¿Â½OX[XULRXVÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½WRRÃ¯Â¿Â½ comfortable and thatÃ¢ÂÂVÃ¯Â¿Â½ZK\Ã¯Â¿Â½ people want to go there. What is your response to that?

WONG:  The Opposition has had a range of policies on this issue as on many others. We have a  very clear policy when it comes to immigration. One that secures $XVWUDOLDÃ¢ÂÂVÃ¯Â¿Â½ERUGHUV  that has a fair  and reasonable system of processing. The Government is very clear about the importance of  pURWHFWLQJÃ¯Â¿Â½$XVWUDOLDÃ¢ÂÂVÃ¯Â¿Â½ERUGHUVÃ¯Â¿Â½DQGÃ¯Â¿Â½WKDWÃ¢ÂÂVÃ¯Â¿Â½WKHÃ¯Â¿Â½ZD\Ã¯Â¿Â½WKHÃ¯Â¿Â½SROLF\Ã¯Â¿Â½LVÃ¯Â¿Â½ RSHUDWLQJÃ¯Â¿Â½



JOURNALIST:  As a result of the Carly Ryan murder trial Senator Xenophon is proposing that we  impose jail sentences for adults who lie about their age to minors online. Tony Abbott says he  would support that. WKDWÃ¢ÂÂ s your view?

WONGÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½:HOOÃ¯Â¿Â½REYLRXVO\Ã¯Â¿Â½HYHU\ERG\Ã¢ÂÂVÃ¯Â¿Â½ILUVWÃ¯Â¿Â½FRQFHUQÃ¯Â¿Â½KHUHÃ¯Â¿Â½LVÃ¯Â¿Â½WKHÃ¯Â¿Â½VDIHW\Ã¯Â¿Â½R IÃ¯Â¿Â½FKLOGUHQÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½7KDWÃ¢ÂÂVÃ¯Â¿Â½DOOÃ¯Â¿Â½RIÃ¯Â¿Â½RXUÃ¯Â¿Â½ first concern when it comes to these issues and if Senator Xenophon has a view about how that can  be improved or that can be strengthened he should speak to the Minister about it and I am sure he  would get a very good hearing.

JOURNALIST:  Also on the two Australian refugee activists that have been deported, detained in  Indonesia. 7KH\Ã¢ÂÂUH  claiming that they have heard from Indonesian officials over there that the  Government is unhappy with the situation Â±  being dumped with this situation Â±  and they are not  prepared to take any more. What is the Government doing to try- with this stand off?

WONG: When it comes to the Merak boat, and I think that is the one you are speaking about, letÃ¢ÂÂ s  just remember that was a vessel intercepted in Indonesian waters by the Indonesian authorities and  the processing of people onboard that boat is therefore a matter for the Indonesian Government.

JOURNALIST:  Do they have a right to be there?

WONG: I think I have answered that question. This is a vessel which was intercepted in Indonesian  waters by the Indonesian authorities and the processing of the people on that vessel is a matter for  Indonesia.

JOURNALIST: Does the government care for the welfare of these Tamils at all?

WONG: Obviously this is a very difficult issue worldwide. We know that people movement has  increased as a result of many factors internationally. But in relation the specific vessel that is an  issue for the Indonesian Government.

JOURNALIST: What about the handling of the Australians? Do the activists have the right to be  there?

WONG: I am not briefed on all the detail of these reports. What I can say to you is what I have  already said which is this was a vessel intercepted by Indonesian authorities in Indonesian waters  and it is a matter for the Indonesian authorities as to how those persons are processed.

JOURNALIST: Just a story in the Sydney Morning Herald talks about the spiralling costs of  mental health and how damaging- is it getting out of control?

WONG:  ,Ã¯Â¿Â½KDYHQÃ¢ÂÂWÃ¯Â¿Â½VHHQÃ¯Â¿Â½WKRVHÃ¯Â¿Â½VWRULHVÃ¯Â¿Â½VRÃ¯Â¿Â½,Ã¯Â¿Â½ZRXOGÃ¯Â¿Â½EHÃ¯Â¿Â½UHOXF tant to comment on it. Thank you.  ENDS
