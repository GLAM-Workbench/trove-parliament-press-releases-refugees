TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW - ABC 702 SYDNEY WITH DEB CAMERON

SUBJECT: NSW BUDGET; CLIMATE CHANGE; WOMEN ON BOARDS.

E  & O E - PROOF ONLY



CAMERON: Senator Penny Wong is Federal Finance Minister and joins me now. Senator  Wong good morning.

WONG: Good morning.

CAMERON: Well Western Australia tried this?

WONG: Well, it’s sort of interesting, your comment about the Premier’s comments around  five marginal seats. It’s a very political way to approach the serious issue of budgeting. I  would have though the people of New South Wales would have wanted the Premier to  focus much more on what’s good for the state, than playing politics with it.

Obviously it’s a matter for the NSW Parliament and the Government, but from where I sit,  you’ve got a budget that’s in deficit, a budget that whacks homeowners, and a budget that’s  about cutting jobs and sacking people. They’ve got billions of dollars worth of savings, with  very little detail, and we’ve got a new mining levy. And I’m still waiting for Tony Abbott to  come out and say that’s a bad thing, given that he thinks any additional taxation on the  mining industry is the end of the world.

CAMERON: Well, is NSW going to get what it wants here? The Treasurer, Wayne Swan,  has already said that you will debit infrastructure allocations to New South Wales. Now,  you’re the Finance Minister.

WONG: Can I say first that I saw your NSW Treasurer making some joke yesterday about  the pittance that the Government spends on NSW. And perhaps your listeners would like to  know that we provided some $12 billion to NSW through the Nation Building program. One  in every three infrastructure dollars goes to NSW. In addition, there was an additional $2  billion from the Building Australia Fund. So, I don’t know how those sorts of numbers are a  pittance, particularly given how much more than the previous Coalition government we are  spending.

But, we’ve made clear the minerals tax is funding a range of things. The minerals tax, when  it passes the Parliament, is funding a tax cut across the economy for business, with a head  start for small business. So it’s directly trying to deal with the patchwork economy  pressures, taking from the mining companies, which are in the fast lane, and spreading the  benefits across the economy, including companies in the slow lane. It’s funding increasing  superannuation for Australians, and it is funding infrastructure. So, obviously, if there’s less  revenue, there’s less expenditure on infrastructure.

CAMERON: But the Premier says that your carbon tax will affect NSW’s budget so severely  - that is how he is justifying this.

WONG: Any port in a storm, I reckon. Any reason he can get to justify his budget. Is this the  Premier who previously supported action on climate change in the past? This is, quite  clearly, out of the Tony Abbott playbook around how you handle politics.

We want to price carbon because we want to do something about climate change. We want  to do something about changing our economy, and we want to do something to ensure that  we hand to our children, and our grandchildren, a less polluting economy and a less  polluting nation than the one we’ve inherited. And that’s a good thing.

CAMERON: In a way though, your weakness is your political vulnerability federally.  Because the Premier believes he’s in touch with the people, he’s just won this massive  landslide, he sees a repeat of that in NSW federally. So if it gets back to your political  vulnerability, and if that gets back to the Prime Minister’s popularity, then he’s on a winner  isn’t he, if he backs self-interest here? Because you will not withdraw funding for NSW if  five marginal seats slide as a result of that.

WONG: We’re already putting a lot of funding into New South Wales, as I said, $12 billion - more than John Howard ever did. But can I make this point, Deb: I don’t think that anybody  who has ever met or seen Prime Minister Gillard in this last year would think that she’s  somebody who simply will react because she’s scared. That she’ll walk away from  important reforms for the nation like a price on carbon, like the minerals tax. And so I think  Premier O’Farrell should perhaps be focused on a more constructive approach to dealing  with his state, and his budget.

CAMERON: Now, the Prime Minister, as you’ve alluded to, has taken a very heavy  personal hit on her own popularity and standing, almost since the day she headed out to  start to argue the case for the carbon tax. And that’s been compounded by the refugee  detention wreck. Everyone expected a brutal year this year. It has turned into a kind of  furnace. Has it surprised you?

WONG: Well, it’s not for the faint-hearted, is it, federal politics. Certainly, we’re not in  debates which are for the faint-hearted. We’re in difficult debates. If we’re talking about  pricing carbon, it’s a debate that’s been around for a long time. I mean, I sat in front of you,  talking about it many times, including in my previous portfolio.

Let’s remember John Howard, half a decade ago said he was going to do this. And we’re  still arguing about it. Now we’ve got Tony Abbott who says the sky’s going to fall in and the  coal industry’s going to end, which is simply not true. But we need to press ahead with this,

someone actually has to have the courage to get this through the Parliament. And that  person is Prime Minister Gillard.

CAMERON: Well of course, in your previous life as Climate Change Minister -

WONG: (laughs) Many lives ago now.

CAMERON: You worked very closely with Kevin Rudd on climate policy. Now what were  his attributes as a leader at that time?

WONG: I think you Deb are inevitably trying to draw me into some comparison comment  and I’m afraid I’m going to disappoint you. I think the Labor Party has had a very, very clear  view about what why we need to price carbon. Paradoxically, it is the Labor Party that is  saying we need a pricing mechanism. It is Tony Abbott who is saying, no actually what we  should do is take money from Australian families, Australian households. We should give  that in grants picked by bureaucrats in Canberra to polluting companies and somehow  that’s going to fix this.

CAMERON: The Labor leadership question hangs there though. I mean Kevin Rudd has  bounced back from heart surgery. He is an unstoppable force. And if you look at the polls  he’s more popular. Now you’ve worked with him closely before so do you think that his  attributes as a leader then resurfaced today?

WONG: Look Deb, I really am not going to get into this. We have a leader. We have a  Prime Minister and we have a Foreign Minister, and Kevin is doing an extremely good job  as Foreign Minister. He is exceptionally talented at foreign affairs and we have a Prime  Minister who is pressing ahead with the reforms which are needed. Reforms which have  until now not been able to get through the Parliament. We do have the votes to get this  through and this is a reform that can be delivered.

CAMERON: Now you are in Sydney because you spoke last night to the Women in  Banking and Finance Annual Forum. And here you are a woman in leadership yourself.  You’ve got a Prime Minister there who you are defending loyally. The subject of women and  their role in Australian corporate life is something we’ve talked about before. Very little  movements, very few movements have been made at the top board level of Australia’s top  companies. How are you going to force that to change?

WONG: There has been some movement, but you’re right. As I said in my speech last night  in 2011, you would have thought we would have gone further. So clearly we need to put  more focus on this. And I think the first thing you can do is do what we’re doing. What I’m  trying to do and what Kate Ellis the Minister is also trying to do which is to talk loudly and  clearly and publicly about it so that people are more conscious of it.

But we can also do things. And the point I made last night is Government can - one of the  ways in which Government can help is to try and increase the number of women on the  boards that we have. So if one of the arguments about the number of women on boards of  companies, that is this is in the private sector, we need past experience on boards, well  obviously (inaudible) if there haven’t been many very women before that, that immediately  lowers the field.

What we can do as government is say, well why don’t we try and be the entity that gives a  woman her first board experience, or her second board experience. So you enable more  women to get prior board experience in the public sphere. And we do have a range of  boards which might enable more women therefore to move into private sphere boards as  well.

CAMERON: Do you think about though - when you look at the treatment the Prime Minister  is getting. And she’s in it for keeps and she took the job in the most remarkable of  circumstances, that there is a sort of inherent hostility to the presence of senior women in  some organisations?

WONG: I think that some of the reaction by some people to the Prime Minister is  undoubtedly gendered. I think there is, things like the signs at some of the rallies that we’ve  spoken about previously where she’s referred to as a witch or a bitch or something, or  those sorts of unacceptable terms. They’re quite clearly pretty gendered terms aren’t they.

I think over time, things do change. There are attitudes that have shifted in the last 20  years, in the last 10 years, and we still have a way to go. I spoke last night about the sort of  implicit barriers, the ones that are not spoken and how we need to try and change the  cultures inside organisations and as any leader knows, as any manager of any company  knows, that’s the hardest thing to do.

CAMERON: One last question, now when you’re at home tonight and you’re tucked up on  the couch with your coffee, will you be watching At Home with Julia?

WONG: (laughs) Until your producer actually mentioned it to me that was on tonight, I  hadn’t realised it was on tonight. But I actually get home to Adelaide tonight so I was hoping  to cook dinner. I haven’t worked out what we’re going to watch yet; I suspect Sophie can  choose.

CAMERON: (laughs), Thank you very much and congratulations by the way.

WONG: Thank you very much, very kind of you.

CAMERON: Senator Penny Wong, the Federal Finance Minister.
