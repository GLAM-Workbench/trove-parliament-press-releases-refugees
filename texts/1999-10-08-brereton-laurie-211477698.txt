PARLIAMENTARY DELEGATION TO VISIT WEST TIMOR

Â

The Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs, Laurie Brereton, today welcomed 
the Indonesian Government’s agreement to  allow an Australian 
Parliamentary Delegation to visit West Timor to investigate the humanitarian 
crisis arising from the relocation of more than 230,000 East Timorese 
from their homes and villages.

Â

“The unfolding crisis in West Timor cannot be underestimated”, 
Mr Brereton said.

Â

“While arrangements reached between the Indonesian 
Government and the ‘United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees 
to begin the return of refugees to East Timor are welcome, reports of 
grim humanitarian conditions in East Timorese ‘refugee camps’ in 
West Timor are a very serious concern.”

Â

“The Federal Member for Griffith, Kevin Rudd, is 
to be commended for proposing this visit of an Australian Parliamentary 
Delegation which will seek to assess conditions in West Timor and the 
adequacy of the international response to date. We would like the Delegation 
to leave for West Timor as soon as is practical.”

Â

“I look forward to travelling with Mr Rudd and hopefully 
two government members in what should be a bipartisan Parliamentary 
Delegation.”
