Parliament Needs Ethnic People

Australians of ethnic origin must take a more active part in Australian- politics,  according to the Australian Democrats.

Speaking at the ‘Access and Equity For Refugees' Forum in Coburg, the  Democrats' Ethnic Affairs Spokesperson, Senator Sid Splndler, challenged refugees  to se e  themselves as part of the Australian community Â· "and that m eans getting  Into Parliament to participate In decisions affecting ethnic Australians."

"This may seem  a giant step for people who are struggling to get access to health  and education services and to employment.
