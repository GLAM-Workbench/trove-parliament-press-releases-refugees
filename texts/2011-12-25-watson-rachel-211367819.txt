SUBJECTS:                           Homelessness, Church and Charitable Organisations,  Cyclone Grant, Paramedic’s death, Acting PM’s plans for Christmas  Day

TREASURER:                       It’s great to be here today at Mission Australia’s CafÃÂ© One.  They do fantastic work. You can see this behind us today, this kitchen that they run here and  have run for a long period of time, to work with the homeless in our community. Because at  Christmas, we think of family, we think of friends, many of us are fortunate to have a home

to go home to, but here there are people who don’t have a home and the work that our great  church and charitable organisations do is just so important to our community.

So at Christmas when we’re all tucking into the Christmas ham, we should be thinking about  those that are less fortunate and the great work that is done by our church and charitable  organisations to assist those people in need, particularly at Christmas.

You can feel the mood here this morning, it’s something special for the people here and that  says a lot about Mission Australia, all of the volunteers here today are working with those  people in need. It says a lot about our community, great community spirit, particularity at  Christmas.

JOURNALIST:                      What’s the reaction from the guys been like? Do many want to  talk politics or anything like that?

TREASURER:                       I think people were pretty happy to say hello and have a bit of a  yarn. Many people remarked that’s it was probably rare to have an Acting Prime Minister  wonder through on Christmas day.  But I wanted to pay tribute in particular today to the work  of our great church and charitable sector, who right across this country day and night, 365  days a year, look after the less fortunate in our community and at Christmas time, really  important that we all think about those that are less fortunate than ourselves.

JOURNALIST:                      There’s obviously a large number of volunteers in there who  give up their Christmas morning…

TREASURER:                       Too right, I’ve been talking to some of the volunteers you  know, they’re from all walks of life, there’s a young lady from across the city who comes  across here to help, she works as a public service in the city, any number of people come  from all over the city, basically to pitch in and help their fellow citizens.  Rachel, do you  want to say something?

WATSON:                              Look, I think a number of our volunteers have been regularly  doing it for over five, six years. It’s something which they book themselves in after today and  say “we’ll work again next year”, and for us that’s a powerful thing for the service to say that  there’s a broad community support for the work that we’re doing.

JOURNALIST:                      What sort of stats, how many meals will you pump out today to  how many people?

WATSON:                              We’ll probably have 150 people come through, as far as meals  we’ll probably have 300 because certainly everyone’s having seconds which you’re allowed  to do on Christmas Day.

TREASURER:                       And I’ll tell you what, the tucker’s pretty good.

JOURNALIST:                      Yeah, we’ve received funding from Brisbane City Council to  put on a really special breakfast, so eggs benedict and beautiful gifts for people, and food that  I guess they wouldn’t normally be getting on Christmas morning if they’re sleeping rough.

JOURNALIST:                      [inaudible] a wide variety of people, different circumstances in  which they find themselves here for different reasons?

WATSON:                              I mean there’s plenty of people here who are living in housing  but very marginal housing and I think what the cafe brings to people is an opportunity to feel  like a member of the community and to be connected and around other people. And certainly  sitting by yourself at a boarding house on Christmas morning isn’t the most exciting or warm  thing to be doing so it’s wonderful that people felt they could come here to get that  community spirit.

JOURNALIST:                      It’s not just the food it’s, as you say, the other people?

WATSON:                              Absolutely, absolutely, the cafÃÂ©’s about people being able to  get good nutritious food but also support if they want to make changes in their life

TREASURER:                       [inaudible] sense of belonging here.

I just wanted to say a couple of other things, I’ve spoken to the Chief Minister of the  Northern Territory this morning, he tells me that Darwin and the Northern Territory are very  well prepared should the cyclone hit in the next day or so. But I just did want to say how well  prepared the Northern Territory is for these events, but also to highlight the very important  work which is done by our emergency services workers, police, our ambulance officers, all of  our emergency service workers who are working around the clock this Christmas. And sadly  there has been a tragedy in New South Wales which reminds us of just how dangerous the

work that our emergency workers do and. Our hearts and prayers go out to the family of that  [inaudible] paramedic from New South Wales.

JOURNALIST:                      For a long time Territorians, a cyclone threat around Christmas  time might bring back memories of Cyclone Tracey.  …Would your words of encouragement  be that, you know, the Territory Government and the emergency services are as prepared as  they can be?

TREASURER:                       Well I think everybody has learnt lessons from the events over  the last 12 months where we’ve seen the largest natural disaster in Australian history. We had  a combination of very big floods and cyclones into Queensland, we saw last year significant  cyclones through the north, including the north-west.  The weather patterns are shaping up in  a similar way this year. But I believe all of our authorities, all of our agencies are as well  prepared as they possibly can be and we’ve all certainly learnt the lessons of the events over  the last 12 months.

JOURNALIST:                      Can you give us an update on the latest asylum seeker boat  which arrived?

TREASURER:                       I can't give you any further info that hasn’t been published at  this stage. But there has been another boat and those asylum seekers have been transferred. I  can't give you any further information than that.

JOURNALIST:                      Can we just ask what your plans are for the rest of the day? Are  you going to go and catch some of that big swell?

TREASURER:                       Well no, I’ve heard the news reports that people have been  banned, that the beaches have been closed. So I don’t think I’d be attempting anything like  that in that environment but I’m really looking forward to having Christmas lunch with the  family and some of our neighbours at home.

JOURNALIST:                      Do you have a ham carving job or a turkey carving job?



TREASURER:                       When I get home I’ll be put to work in the kitchen. OK, thank  you.
