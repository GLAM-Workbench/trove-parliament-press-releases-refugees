22 July 2011

TRANSCRIPT OF THE HON. TONY ABBOTT MHR  INTERVIEW WITH LISA WILKINSON,  TODAY SHOW, CHANNEL NINE

Subjects: Julia Gillard’s carbon tax.

E&OE……………………….…………………………………………………………………

LISA WILKINSON:

Good morning to you Mr Abbott.

TONY ABBOTT:

`Morning Lisa.

LISA WILKINSON:

Now you would have seen the newspapers this morning. Fairfax media is reporting that the Government has  finally sealed the asylum seeker deal with Malaysia. Do you think that this deal is going to have any effect  on boat arrivals?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, it’s a bad deal. I don't think that it is going to stop the boats and it is another broken promise from a  Prime Minister who said that she would never send boat people to a country that hadn't signed the UN  Refugee Convention. It's now two and a half months since the so-called Malaysian Deal was first announced  and I think in that time, we've had ten boats and more than 500 people arrive.

LISA WILKINSON:

Although those boat numbers are down. There are a couple that were reported in the last 24 to 48 hours as  arriving but generally the boat numbers have been down since they announced it.

TONY ABBOTT:

There’s no doubt that since that terrible tragedy on Christmas Island in December boat numbers are down.  But I think that that’s due to the natural anxieties of people about deaths at sea rather than to the  Government's policy.

LISA WILKINSON:

Alright, well, let’s get to the week. It's been a very busy week and dominating the headlines has been the  Rupert Murdoch phone-hacking scandal. Julia Gillard says News Limited in Australia has some tough  questions to answer. You've told her to put up or shut up. But I'm not quite sure. I don't think that many  people know what you meant by that. Can you explain that?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, Julia Gillard should explain what the questions are. I mean, what questions does she think that Paul  Kelly and Dennis Shanahan and Steve Lewis and all of these other News Limited journalists have to  answer? Is she suggesting that News Limited here in Australia have been acting like the News of the World  in the United Kingdom? Unless the Prime Minister can say exactly what her problem with News Limited  here in Australia is, it looks like a cheap smear. It looks like an attempt to bully News Limited out of their  tough reporting, tough but fair reporting, of her carbon tax disaster.

LISA WILKINSON:

But News Limited CEO John Hartigan has launched his own inquiry. He is looking at payments over the last  three years just to make sure that News Limited locally has not been affected by the culture that exists in the  UK. So he obviously thinks that it is ok?

TONY ABBOTT:

No, I think you are putting words into his mouth, Lisa. He says that the Prime Minister has no justification  whatsoever for smearing News Limited in Australia. And, as I said, for the Prime Minister to make these  sorts of statements, to raise these sorts of issues, as I said, she is trying to bully News Limited out of its fair  but tough coverage of her carbon tax disaster.

LISA WILKINSON:

Ok, well, speaking of the carbon tax, here's what you said on radio this week.

TONY ABBOTT:

I’ve never been in favour of a carbon tax or an emissions trading scheme.

LISA WILKINSON:

So that was this week, but back in October 2009 you said, you said this on two separate occasions.

TONY ABBOTT:

We are taking the issue seriously and we would like to see an ETS and that's why I think it makes  sense to have an ETS.

LISA WILKINSON:

So looking at those, it would seem that you're just as guilty as Julia Gillard at changing positions on the  carbon tax?

TONY ABBOTT:

I have never supported a carbon tax or an ETS as leader. Obviously in times past the Coalition, of which I'm  a member, has had a different position. But the fact is that when it comes to deception, this is the Prime  Minister who said just six days before the last election that “there will be no carbon tax under the  government I lead”. Now, let's not forget, Lisa, I resigned from the shadow cabinet over the issue of an ETS.  I think that I have a very strong, very firm, very clear and very consistent position.

LISA WILKINSON:

So if your problem is broken election promises, back in 2005, when you were Health Minister, you broke an  election promise then not to raise the Medicare safety net. Let's have a listen to that.

TONY ABBOTT:

When I made that statement in the election campaign, I had not the slightest inkling that there would  ever be any intention to change this. But obviously, when circumstances change, governments do  change their opinions.

LISA WILKINSON:

And isn’t that the case that’s exactly the same as what Julia Gillard has done and when you feel passionately  about an issue and if situations change, politicians can change their mind? I mean, you've supported that.

TONY ABBOTT:

But when a government goes to an election saying that there will be no carbon tax and then decides a couple  of months later that there must be a carbon tax, it has to seek a mandate from the people otherwise the  Australian public are entitled to feel totally ripped off, Lisa, and that's what they do, they feel totally ripped  off about a bad tax based on a lie.

LISA WILKINSON:

But you didn’t do that with the Medicare safety net, Tony. You didn’t do that. You said, I feel passionately  about this. Situations change and I feel passionately about this and this is what we're going to do.

TONY ABBOTT:

That’s exactly what we did over the GST. John Howard said before the 1996 election that he didn't support a  GST. He changed his mind and he took the GST to an election and that's what the Prime Minister should do  now. There should be no tax collection without an election and if the Prime Minister tries to sneak this bad  tax based on a lie through a parliament with no mandate the Australian public are going to feel very ripped  off and angry.

LISA WILKINSON:

Is it really a lie if she didn't believe that the situation was going to change? She did believe it before she  went to the election, she did believe it before the election happened. Situations change. Does that mean that  it is a lie or just that the situation changed?

TONY ABBOTT:

Lisa, I said lots and lots of times - and I would love you to show that footage - before the election, as sure  as night follows day, there will be a carbon tax if this government is re-elected. I think I said it at least 15  times. And Julia Gillard deliberately went out there and said "there will be no carbon tax under the  government I lead." She knew exactly what she was doing and you can't make that kind of a categoric  statement six days out from an election and then as soon as the election is over, to save your own skin, do  the opposite. You just can't do that without people feeling ripped off and angry and it is this lie which is  destroying the Government.

LISA WILKINSON:

Alright. Moving on now. The news this week that Kevin Rudd is having heart surgery. His doctor says that  is he'll come back healthier than he is now. That's not great news for Julia Gillard, possibly?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, I wish Kevin well. Obviously, this is a problem he's had for a while. It didn't stop him from being a  very vigorous Opposition Leader. It didn't stop him from being Prime Minister and it shouldn’t stop him  from having a strong role to play in the future.

LISA WILKINSON:

Have you sent him your best wishes, Tony?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look Julie Bishop has sent Kevin best wishes from all of us. And Julie and Kevin speak very regularly. In  fact, I think that they're each other's second best friends these days.

LISA WILKINSON:

Oh there you go, there's a revelation. Tony Abbott, thank you very much for your time. Have a very good  weekend.

TONY ABBOTT:

And you.
