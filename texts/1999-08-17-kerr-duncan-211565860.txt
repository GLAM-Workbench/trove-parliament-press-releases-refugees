Law abiding Christmas Is land residents are having to go without 
some basic food because of the pressure to feed the 142 illegal arrivals 
that are kept on the Island and who cannot be transferred to the overcrowded 
Port Hedland Detention Centre.

Â

“The Minister responsible, Senator Vanstone, must 
arrange immediately for food to be flown in to meet the shortage. Fresh 
food on the Island is never in abundance. The Government has an obligation 
to ensure the proper treatment and care of the illegal arrivals, but 
not at the expense of the families on the island,” Shadow Minister 
for Justice and Customs, Duncan Kerr, said today.

Â

“It is not clear how long the detainees are to be 
held on the Island, while the Government comes up with alternative arrangements.

Â

“The Sports Centre housing the arrivals is not suited 
to hold this number of people. The 142 detainees are said to have to 
share two toilets. This raises a serious health and hygiene issue.

Â

“Most people on the Island are not supportive of 
the idea of building a permanent holding facility on Christmas Island.

Â

“While it makes sense to have detention centres 
in remote areas, it would make more sense to address the cause rather 
than the symptom.

Â

“Clearly the Government’s intelligence network 
in Indonesia has not been effective to even disrupt this pattern of 
people smuggling.

Â

“It is understood that these people arrive at Jakarta 
airport without travel documents, are smuggled and hidden in warehouses 
until arrangements for their passage by sea are made by their paid smugglers. 
The destination is often Christmas Island.

“In fact, it is so commonplace that when officials 
arrive from Canberra to deal with arrivals the parting exchange is ‘see 
you next time’.

Â

“It is deplorable that an issue of national security 
is treated with such complacency.”
