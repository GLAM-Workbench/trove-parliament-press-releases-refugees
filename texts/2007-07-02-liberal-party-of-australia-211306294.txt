Pike misleads on HIV Testing for Refugees

Monday, 2 July 2007

Bronwyn Pike’s latest comments in calling for refugees to be screened for HIV  are simply another example of Minister Pike refusing to accept responsibility  for her own failings as Victorian Health Minister.

Ms Pike knows that there is mandatory testing of all refugees for HIV and  other diseases before being permitted to migrate to Australia .

Ms Pike also knows that Australia has one of the strictest migration health  screening processes in the world.

Health screening has been a long standing feature of Australia 's migration  programme. To suggest that this is not the case is simply misleading.

If a refugee is found to be suffering from a disease, then they must seek  treatment before being permitted to enter Australia .

Consideration will only be given to the granting of a visa to those applicants  who are assessed as not posing a public health risk and who comply with  strict health undertakings.

The Victorian Government’s continued incompetency in dealing with HIV  cases and ensuring the community is protected is appalling and to seek to  blame anyone else for this is reprehensible.
