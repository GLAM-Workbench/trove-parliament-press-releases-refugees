FEDERAL MINISTER FOR  INFRASTRUCTURE & TRANSPORT   INTERVIEW STEVE PRICE  2 SEPTEMBER 2011  E & O E - PROOF ONLY  Subjects:    Marrickville protest, News Ltd  STEVE PRICE:          Now, Anthony Albanese I think, set himself up the other day when he was in Federal Parliament in question time, and he attacked the convoy that turned up outside Parliament House, it was there for two days, a number of truck drivers that came from as far away as Port Hedland, I think he used the line 'convoy of no consequence', and talked about, in fairly disparaging terms, the numbers. He said, “I get more people who like the trots, turning up outside my office on a regular basis, than are outside the House this morning”. Well, he yesterday was confronted by those same people, some of the same people, outside his own office, it turned pretty ugly. [Replay] ANTHONY ALBANESE:        You're entitled to your opinion. PROTESTER:            Listen, look, hey, hey, the comments that you made down in Canberra last week, about a convoy of [overspeaking], is absolutely ridiculous, and you should be - and your mother would be ashamed of you. ANTHONY ALBANESE:        You're entitled to your view. No, my late mother is certainly not ashamed of me. PROTESTER:            A loser, loser, you're a gutless loser… ANTHONY ALBANESE:        Well, I'm here, mate, I'm here. PROTESTER:            You're a gutless loser. [Replay ends] STEVE PRICE:          The minister's on the line, minister, good morning.

ANTHONY ALBANESE:        G'day, Steve, how are you?

STEVE PRICE:          I'm well. Did you go back out to wind them up?

ANTHONY ALBANESE:        No, I was invited to speak to them on Monday. They wrote  to me, and asked me would I address them, I did address them, I greeted them when  they arrived. I had substantial Federal police presence there, they advised me, I always  take the advice of police at demonstrations, that's the right thing to do, they were

concerned about some of the elements in the crowd, they asked me to go back  essentially, just walk 15 metres away while they organised to ensure that it was done in  as peaceful a way as possible. I must say, the main organiser was very responsible, and  he was about trying to ensure that it was done in an orderly way, but obviously some of  the crowd, as you would have heard there, were pretty abusive, and pretty riled up.

STEVE PRICE:          You've seen probably worse than that, but I mean, it's getting a bit  ugly, isn't it, this stuff?

ANTHONY ALBANESE:        Look, it is Steve, and that's one of my concerns, is that  people are being riled up. You had people yesterday saying this was, you know, a  demonstration because we don't have a democracy. Well there's an obvious  contradiction there, which is people do have democracy, people do have freedom of  speech. My comments last week went to that point, the idea that the sort of conspiracy

theories that are out there, last week we had that people were stopped from  demonstrating in Canberra. That was not true, people were not stopped at the border.  We know that in terms of democracy, people are entitled to their views, but the idea that  a demonstration can overturn what is a democratically elected Government, whether  people agree with all the decisions of the Government or not, the fact is, it is a  democratically elected Government. I sat in Opposition for 11 years under the Howard  Government, I didn't like it, I wished we were the Government, but I accepted that that  was the outcome, even when in of course 1998 we won 51.4 per cent of the two party  preferred vote.

STEVE PRICE:          You're a year into the minority Government, coupled together with  the Independents, how's it gone so badly wrong, so quickly?

ANTHONY ALBANESE:        Well, if you look at the outcome in terms of the Parliament  Steve, it's actually functioning extraordinarily well, we've had …

STEVE PRICE:          I know you're going to quote the bills that have gone through, but I  mean…

ANTHONY ALBANESE:        Well, we've had 185 pieces of legislation…

STEVE PRICE:          …you're a smart politician, you read the papers, you see the  press, you hear the radio, you watch the television programs, the commentariat, whether  you like it or not, has turned on Julia Gillard, the front page of the Herald Sun this  morning's got a glum-looking picture of her saying, 'Tick, tick, tick', there's a poll in that  paper, 91 per cent of people saying they want Julia Gillard gone, I mean you must be  getting to the point surely, where you think, we've got to do something to break this  cycle, because we can't keep going?

ANTHONY ALBANESE:        Look, Steve, we're going through a tough time, there's no  doubt about that, but we're also determined to get on with the agenda that we have,  we've got three important things coming up during this session, the…

STEVE PRICE:          But the agenda keeps getting hijacked by things like the High  Court saying that your asylum-seeker program is illegal, and you can't do it.

ANTHONY ALBANESE:        Sure, well we had, I think, very clearly we had legal advice  that it was okay, there weren't too many people out there in the media saying that the  High Court would come down with the judgement that they did, but that having been  said, we have to deal with that.

STEVE PRICE:          But you're really smart, and you know, and alarm bells go off for  you, when decisions are taken that you think, I'm not sure we should be doing this, how  did you ever think that forcing people back onto planes from Christmas Island, and flying  them back to Malaysia, would resonate with the public?

Did you not sort of think to yourself, well hang on, we don't want people smugglers,  we're sure we don't want the boats to keep coming, but is that really a good idea? Didn't  you sit in Cabinet, I know you can't tell me what you said, but didn't you sit there and  think, I don't reckon that's a smart thing to do?

ANTHONY ALBANESE:        Well, what it was Steve, was an attempt to deal with the  issue of how do you break the people smugglers' model, how do you remove the  incentive for people to risk their lives by getting on boats, and that was the basis of it,  that is why in terms of Malaysia, the agreement was reached between the Australian  Government and Malaysia, as you're aware, there was speculation, and a number of  options considered, but…

STEVE PRICE:          Well, you could have just reopened Nauru.

ANTHONY ALBANESE:        Well, there were problems with Nauru of course, which is  that the people who were on Nauru by and large, of course, were settled in Australia,  what Malaysia was about was trying to get a regional solution to what's a regional  problem, and we know that the issue of asylum-seekers isn't just an issue for Australia,  it's a problem for the whole region.

STEVE PRICE:          Are people in the party talking about moving Julia Gillard on?

ANTHONY ALBANESE:        No, certainly they're not talking to me about that, what  we're talking about is how we continue to pursue our agenda, we obviously have to get  out there, I think we have to communicate better with people, I think we have - you  know, we had a community Cabinet last night here in Brisbane, where the Prime  Minister and the Government were - it was a very constructive community Cabinet  meeting, there was a good spirit in the room, there would have been…

STEVE PRICE:          Hand-picked audience though.

ANTHONY ALBANESE:        No, they're not, Steve…

STEVE PRICE:          Yes, they are.

ANTHONY ALBANESE:        …they are not, Steve…

STEVE PRICE:          So anyone who turns up at the front door, can get in?

ANTHONY ALBANESE:        No, anyone who registers in the order…

STEVE PRICE:          There you go [laughs].

ANTHONY ALBANESE:        In the order in which they simply register, they certainly are  not hand-picked, the questions went from - the first question was very critical about our  stance in Afghanistan.

STEVE PRICE:          No-one's prepared to put their hand up and say, I'm saying this,  that we have people like Phil Hudson, the Herald Sun today, senior Government officials  saying, Julia's lost her authority, others saying that we need to move on her quickly,  that's not happening?

ANTHONY ALBANESE:        No, I mean you've got unnamed sources, as I understand  it, I haven't seen the Herald Sun, but I…

STEVE PRICE:          It's an invention, is it?

ANTHONY ALBANESE:        Well, you have unnamed sources, you know, when you  have political parties, inevitably there are one or two disgruntled people, I can give you

the names of people who will tell you that Tony Abbott should be deposed as Opposition  Leader, who are Coalition members, and you know that there are…

STEVE PRICE:          Who are they?

ANTHONY ALBANESE:        …you know who they are, Steve, they're the ones who sit  at the back, but really think that they should be at the front there instead of Bronwyn  Bishop and Sophie Mirabella and the people who Tony Abbott's picked to be at the front.

STEVE PRICE:          Andrew Bolt will join me shortly, you had a crack at him in print  this week, you said we continue to get extreme views trotted out, including slander  against the Prime Minister, you said that Andrew Bolt was a lesser man, I think the  quote was today, than he was the day before, what was that all about?

ANTHONY ALBANESE:        Well I'm happy to talk to Andrew about it directly, as I  showed yesterday, I'm not someone who shies from an argument. I think that the  innuendo and slander that was there in The Australian on Monday, in Glenn Milne's  piece, that was then withdrawn by The Australian, an apology given to the Prime  Minister on Tuesday. Andrew Bolt said over the weekend that this could be an issue in  which the Prime Minister might have to consider whether she would resign. Andrew of  course put a thing on his blog, saying that he was withdrawing from any political

comment until further notice, and was considering issues of principle, you know, this  was an old story, an old story…

STEVE PRICE:          Look, I'm not even pushing you, I'm not ambushing…

ANTHONY ALBANESE:        …that was rejected a long time ago.

STEVE PRICE:          I'm not ambushing you, you know I'd never do that…

ANTHONY ALBANESE:        No, sure.

STEVE PRICE:          …you said you're willing to talk to him…

ANTHONY ALBANESE:        Sure.

STEVE PRICE:          Andrew?

ANDREW BOLT:        Well, no, I feel like I'm ambushing him, that's not fair to his…

STEVE PRICE:          Well, I don't think either of us are.

ANTHONY ALBANESE:        No, no problem at all. G'day, Andrew, how are you?

ANDREW BOLT:        Anthony, very well, thank you, better than I was a couple of days  ago. Anthony, I was - alright, you're entitled to have your crack at me, I have a crack at  you, and you still remain my favourite Italian-born politician in Parliament, Italian  background politician in Parliament…

ANTHONY ALBANESE:        Very good, thanks mate, still your favourite lefty, I hope?

ANDREW BOLT:        Absolutely, absolutely, you play it hard, and I like it. You said, you  said, I told - I pointed to lies being told about the Prime Minister, I wonder which of those  claims made about her, in the Glenn Milne article, that she insisted be removed, in-toto,  was the lie?

ANTHONY ALBANESE:        Well, The Australian has of course withdrawn - I don't have  the article in front of me…

STEVE PRICE:          No, none of us do.

ANDREW BOLT:        No, no, but I hate being told that I'm you know, in some way  condoning lies, I don't do that.

ANTHONY ALBANESE:        The Australian have themselves withdrawn that article on  Tuesday, and apologised, and have said that it contained - I haven't got their apology in  front of me, but it was something along the lines of, we acknowledge that there were  untruths stated…

ANDREW BOLT:        Yes.

ANTHONY ALBANESE:        …and errors of fact in that article…

ANDREW BOLT:        I've identified one of those errors of facts, that is that Julia Gillard  actually lived in the same house as her then partner, a house which was used - the  funds used for it were allegedly ripped off from union members, or companies. Now I  don't believe that's true, I don't believe she did share that house.

Apart from that, what other…

ANTHONY ALBANESE:         Well that's a pretty good point…

ANDREW BOLT:        No, it's critical, exactly, exactly, exactly, Anthony, I agree, but that  does not say you remove the whole article.

ANTHONY ALBANESE:        And one of the things that should have happened is that  there should have been some checking of that with the Prime Minister. And in The  Australian's apology, and you know, I said as part of my statement, if you look at when I  was asked about it at the press conference as well, I said I think The Australian's  opinion page is terrific, I avail myself of it regularly, and they have broad opinion, and on  the day I was asked, I forget what day it was, Michael Kirby had a piece…

ANDREW BOLT:        But what I'm trying to get to, Anthony, is that the only error you  could find?

ANTHONY ALBANESE:        Look, I take The Australian's apology at face value, I don't  have the article in front of me, it's not up to me to, if they don't print the article…

ANDREW BOLT:        I hope you don't feel…

ANTHONY ALBANESE:        …to be fair, Andrew, it is not up to me to go through the  article piece by piece.

STEVE PRICE:          Okay. I hope you don't feel ambushed by that, minister, thanks for  your time.

Anthony Albanese there.
