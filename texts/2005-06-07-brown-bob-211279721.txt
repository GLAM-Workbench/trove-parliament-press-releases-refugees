Greens arrange legal advice for Chinese  diplomat

6th Jun 2005

The Greens have arranged for legal advice for Chinese diplomat, Mr  Chen Yonglin.  "Mr Chen should have been given immediate assistance by the  Australian Government 12 days ago but instead he has been left with  no support," Senator Brown said.  "I spoke to the chiefs of staff in both Foreign Minister Downer’s and  Immigration Minister Vanstone’s offices on Saturday night. I was told  that Mr Chen had not sought asylum and was not contactable.   I have had no formal response to my request that Mr Chen be given  the assistance he requires.  "It is a disgrace that instead of helping Mr Chen, the Australian  Government has in fact been consulting with the Chinese  Government", Senator Brown said.   The Greens are calling for a Senate investigation into the  Government’s handling of this issue when the Senate resumes next  week.  This morning Senator Brown has written to Foreign Minister Downer  with a copy to the Prime Minister, formally requesting the Australian  Government provide Mr Chen with immediate protection and political  asylum in this country.   Mr Chin Jin, (Federation for a Democratic China, Australia) and Ben  Oquist from Senator Brown’s office have been assisting Mr Chen and  will be available for comment this afternoon. On legal advice Mr Chen  will not be making further comment today.
