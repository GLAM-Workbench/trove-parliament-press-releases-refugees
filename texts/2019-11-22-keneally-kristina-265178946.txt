MORRISON GOVERNMENT FINALLY RELEASES SHERGOLD REVIEW INTO

REFUGEE RESETTLEMENT



After refusing multiple Freedom of Information requests and media queries, the Morrison

Government has finally released the Shergold Review into refugee and humanitarian

resettlement close to a year after it was commissioned by the Prime Minister himself.



Labor welcomes the release of this important report - paid for by the Australian taxpayer -

which aims to improve the integration, employment and settlement outcomes of refugees in

this country. Labor will carefully consider its findings.



It beggars believe Scott Morrison has kept it secret for this long. In fact, he and Immigration

Minister David Coleman have been sitting on the review by respected former bureaucrat Peter

Shergold since they received it in February, almost 10 months ago.



The report raises concerns about the third term Liberal National Government’s “coordination

failure” of refugee settlement services which “needs to be remedied as a matter of urgency”

and the failure in helping refugees find meaningful work.



“The failure to ensure speedy labour market integration has not only had a profoundly

detrimental impact on refugees, but imposes significant costs on Australia.” - report page 34.



“The present jobactive system is simply not delivering the outcomes for refugees that it

should… Unfortunately, too many refugees find themselves trapped in employment which

offers no chance to use their experience and develop their capabilities.” - report page 35.



“Too often refugees find themselves placed in the ‘too hard’ basket. Everybody loses.” -

report page 35.



Refugees have too often lived incredibly painful and dangerous lives, and when they settle in

Australia we should be doing everything we can to help people get the support they need, find

work and integrate into the community.



Regional communities have always strived to go above and beyond in welcoming refugees

and Labor welcomes any steps to encourage at resettlement in the regions.



But any resettlement targets from the Morrison Government are meaningless in the absence of

proper support services - including funding.



Whilst Labor has been listening closely to newly-arrived refugees, advocates, settlement

service providers and employers about these challenges, the Morrison Government and

Immigration Minister David Coleman have been hiding from their responsibilities.



Under the third term Liberal National Government, migrants and refugees have been denied

the opportunity to fulfil their full potential including:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ 60 per cent of migrants from non-English speaking backgrounds working in jobs that

don’t match their skill levels at an estimated cost of $6 billion a year;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ research showing proper social inclusion of migrants could boost the Australian

economy by $12.7 billion; and



Ã¢ÂÂ¢ concerning research about the prevalence of racism - such as 82 per cent of Asian

Australians having experienced discrimination and one in five African students being

threatened by another student.

Scott Morrison has already failed the Australian community - including our newest Australians

- for refusing to release this important and credible report for so long.



It’s now time this third term Liberal National Government to ensure the recommendations

made in the report are implemented as quickly as possible to make up for the time wasted by

Scott Morrison.
