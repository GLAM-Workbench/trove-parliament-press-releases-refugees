TRANSCRIPT OF SENATOR GARY HUMPHRIES

INTERVIEW WITH MARK PARTON,

RADIO 2CC, CANBERRA

MARK PARTON:

We learnt this morning that four of the Tamil asylum seekers rescued by the Oceanic Viking and  offered a special deal by the Rudd Government will be refused visas after ASIO determined them a  threat to national security. Correct me if I’m wrong, but isn’t this exactly what Wilson Tuckey

suggested some months ago and was knocked from pillar to post, anyway. The Government lobbied  furiously to settle the 78 Sri Lankans swiftly following their stand-off aboard the Australian Customs  boat, but according to The Australian this morning, four of the Tamils being held at Christmas Island  have been issued with ‘adverse security  assessments’ by Australia’s chief domestic security agency,  ASIO which makes this pretty interesting. Our own Senator Gary Humphries is the Shadow  Parliamentary Secretary for Citizenship and he joins us right now. Morning Gary.

GARY HUMPHRIES:

Morning, Mark.

MARK PARTON:

This becomes a bit of a catch-22 because these four asylum seekers are now seemingly in permanent  limbo.

GARY HUMPHRIES:

Indeed, it’s a very, very tough situation because Australia has assumed a level of responsibility for  these and the others on the Oceanic Viking it has attempted to resettle a number of these people  around the world, including in Australia apparently. Yet, it now finds that four of the people that it’s  assumed responsibility for have a security status which makes it unacceptable to bring them into  Australia and presumably any other country.

MARK PARTON:

This is pretty much exactly what Wilson Tuckey suggested at that doorstop interview.

GARY HUMPHRIES:

I suppose it is, I suppose it is what Wilson was saying and this article in The Australian which has  broken the story suggests that ASIO has had some concerns about the people arriving by boat from Sri  Lanka because there’s an assumption there and presumably not just to these four people but to others

as well that a number of them could well be former fighters for the Tamil Tigers so there is a more  than small possibility that people arriving by boat could in fact be former members of this  organisation  classed officially in Australia and in many other countries as a terrorist organisation.

MARK PARTON:

So what do we do with them now? Obviously, we can’t return the four to Sri Lanka. I don’t know  what else we can do with them because the UN High Commissioner for Refugees has designated all  78 of the Sri Lankans are legal refugees, we’re on board with all that.

GARY HUMPHRIES:

Mark, it’s a very difficult situation and I’m not going to offer advice to the Australian Government at  this point because in my opinion, it should have never taken the approach that it did to this particular  boat load of people. It obviously did a special deal with the people on the Oceanic Viking. By doing  that it assumed a level of responsibility for their outcomes or their welfare and they now find that they  have people that they really accommodate in Australia, that we can’t ask another country to  accommodate or to take on and they can’t return to Sri Lanka. So this is a situation of the  Government’s making, they ought never to have negotiated a special deal. They certainly have never  made it clear what the terms of those special deal entails. We don’t know what other conditions might  have been associated with this. Presumably, the Indonesians won’t be keen to retain these people  either.

MARK PARTON:

It’s going to be a very, very tough exercise to sweep this under the carpet and a very, very expensive  exercise.

GARY HUMPHRIES:

Exactly, and you get the impression that Australia has been leaning very heavily on a number of  countries around the world. The article suggests that countries like Canada, the US and Norway have  been approached to take some of these people. You can only assume that’s the result of furious  diplomatic efforts by Australia to make sure that somebody was prepared to take these people and  Australia was keen, apparently, not to let too many of them come to Australia. We now find that they  have a number of them who can’t easily be accommodated in those countries and it all flows down  from that decision in August of 2008 by the Rudd Government to relax the terms of Australia’s  migration policy, particularly our border protection policy in a way that is now encouraging larger and  larger numbers of people to come to Australia by boat in this fashion. That’s going to replicate this  problem time and again if we’re not very careful, Mark. I think the first thing the Australian  Government’s got to do is turn off the tap, is indicate very clearly to people smugglers that it will not  facilitate this kind of trade, that it will not roll out the red carpet for people in these circumstances and  hopefully that reduces the likleyhood that we find ourselves having assumed responsibility for people  who are essentially untouchable by Australia or any other country because their potential terrorist  status.

MARK PARTON:

Mate, we will watch this with much fascination. Thanks for taking our call this morning.
