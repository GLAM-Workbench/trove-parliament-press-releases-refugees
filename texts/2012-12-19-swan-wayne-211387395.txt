Doorstop interview  Townsville

SUBJECTS: Townsville Hospital Federal Government investments; Newman Government  health cuts; ADF abuse; Foreign Aid; Tony Abbott and Mal Brough; Eligibility for service  medals.

TREASURER:

Cathy O'Toole and I have just finished meeting with a significant number of nurses from the  hospital, talking to them about the impact on services, and on themselves of the very savage  cuts that are being made to healthcare at this very important hospital.

It's a very important medical facility, not just for Townsville but really for the whole of  Northern Queensland.  A very important facility which is deserving of significant  government support.

In terms of the Federal Government, we have made very significant investments in this  hospital over a significant period of time.  Since coming to office we've made $390 million  worth of investments in this hospital because that reflects our commitment to quality health  care for people living in rural and regional Australia.

For example, we've expanded the current operating theatre; there's a new clinical block that  will accommodate up to 64 additional beds; expansion of pathology, laboratory and other  supporting infrastructure; $60 million in both capital and recurrent funding [for] subacute  beds; $67.5 million to enhance cancer services - and in particular the PET scanner.

So I make the point that the Gillard Government absolutely understands the importance to the  well-being and peace of mind of Australians living in rural and regional areas, the importance  of quality healthcare.

But unfortunately from what I've heard today talking to the hard working nursing staff, that  healthcare is now under pressure.  The fact is that staff have been sacked here, something like  300 full time equivalent positions have been lost, and in terms of nursing positions,  significant numbers of nursing positions have been lost. And what the staff have been saying  to us today is that it is having a tremendous impact on the quality of care, on the ability and  confidence of staff to make decisions about how they prioritise cases within the hospital, it's  impacting upon morale. It's, in short, having a devastating impact on this community.

So today I would urge Campbell Newman to put down the scalpel.  Stop cutting away and get  back to talk to the people at the grassroots about how this is impacting - not just on the staff -  but on the whole community.

I know from my local area in Brisbane, the same is happening there.  We're seeing the impact  on what's being decided on Eventide in Brisbane, and of course, decisions are still  forthcoming here in terms of aged care beds.

So I urge the Queensland Government to put away the scalpel, because when it comes to  health funding in Queensland, there are significant increases in Commonwealth funding  flowing through to Queensland Health. An additional $600 million over the period of the  current agreement, a 21 per cent increase.

Sadly, at the same time as that increase in federal funding is flowing through, the Newman  Government is cutting $1.6 billion from the Queensland health budget, and of course, we've  seen the loss overall state-wide in health of something like 4,000 jobs, state-wide, in health  alone.  This is a very serious issue and that's why it was a privilege to hear today from  hardworking nurses about the impact of this on this community.  Because at the end of the  day what they're most concerned about, and Cathy can attest to this, is what this means for  their patients. And there are flow on effects, and that's what is so serious.  I'll just turn to  Cathy to say a few words.

O'TOOLE:

I've been speaking regularly over the last few weeks with a range of health workers, nurses  and allied health professionals, and their concern is really about the quality work that they  can do given these savage job cuts.  They're being put in a position where they have to work  in a much quicker mode, being asked to spend less time with patients and to move on quickly  so that patient throughput is increased.  This is causing huge distress for these people because  we have a number of incredibly dedicated staff at this hospital and it's simply not fair to  them, or their patients.  And it's the patients that they are most concerned about.

JOURNALIST:

What do you make of Lawrence Springborg's comments of the recent federal cuts to funding  - what do you make of that comment?

TREASURER:

He's simply a desperate man.  He's slashed the health budget by $1.6 billion.  The Federal  health budget is increasing substantially, by 21 per cent or $600 million.  The problem is that  he's cutting his budget by $1.6 billion, and that's the problem.  We reached an agreement with  the states for a very generous increase in funding over time, and that generous increase is  flowing through.  But at the same time, Mr Newman and Mr Springborg have got the scalpel  out and are cutting state funding, that's what's happening here and the consequences of it  were readily apparent when talking to the nurses today.

JOURNALIST:

Mr Swan, apparently some of the state based health and hospital boards have written to the  Federal Government asking you to have a look at their funding?

TREASURER:

Our funding is in a signed and sealed agreement, signed with the State Government.  The  problem is that the State Government is pulling its money out as additional federal money  comes in.  That's what we're living with the consequences of.  And I tell you what, for many  communities, they are dire.

JOURNALIST:

Mr Springborg has accused you of refusing to outline the impacts of the federal cuts to the  health funding, how do you take that considering the impact that has possibly come from  their cuts?

TREASURER:

It's just not true.  There's a signed and sealed agreement that delivers very significant funding  increases to the Queensland Government, it is there for everybody to see. Now, Mr  Springborg and Mr Newman, they're desperate people.  They've got the scalpel out and  they're trying to escape responsibility for the devastating impact of these cuts on local  communities.

JOURNALIST:

Today it was revealed that Brigadier Shane Caughey mishandled a sexual harassment claim  back in the 90s.  What is your response to that, that Townsville's most senior military  personnel mishandled sexual harassment -

TREASURER:

This is a serious issue which the Defence Minister should respond to.  I certainly am not in  possession of all of the details and I would refer you to the Defence Minister.

JOURNALIST:

Are you concerned about revelations that around 10 serving officers that are accused of rape  in the 1990s may still be serving? And should they be stood down while the investigations are  carried out?

TREASURER:

These are issues which are the subject of processes instigated by the Minister for  Defence.  There's a process going on now outlined by Minister Stephen Smith to the  Parliament about two weeks ago.  And those matters are best dealt with in that process.  Where there have been past legal processes and investigations, I'll leave it to the Defence  Minister to talk to you about those.

JOURNALIST:

Mr Swan, which foreign aid programs will be cut to make sure there's enough money to  house and look after asylum seekers that are coming to Australia?

TREASURER:

Can I just make this point really clear: we have a record foreign aid budget, $5.2 billion, and  it has increased by 71 per cent since the Government was first elected.  So there's a  substantial increase going on in the aid budget, and we're on track to meet our commitment  and targets for foreign aid.  So I just would urge people to be careful with their description of  what is going on with the aid budget because it is increasing.

In terms of where the aid budget is spent, they are decisions that are taken by the responsible  Minister and by the Government, and it is entirely appropriate that some of the foreign aid  budget is spent dealing with displaced persons and people who are applying for refugee  status, and it's entirely appropriate under those OECD guidelines that that money is spent  offshore or onshore and that is what occurs elsewhere in the world.

JOURNALIST:

But surely you're operating under a budget, so that means if you are going to be spending  money on those things which you said are appropriate and the OECD says is appropriate,  you'd have to find some room from somewhere else? Is it a Kenyan Budget or -

TREASURER:

They have always been appropriate under those OECD guidelines -

JOURNALIST:

Absolutely. So which other programs would be cut then to make sure there is enough money  for these other programs?

TREASURER:

First of all these are matters which are budgeted for by the Minister and the Department and  they are decisions taken by the Government.  There is a substantial increase in the aid budget  flowing through.  Decisions about priorities within that are [part of] the normal course of  decision making within the Department, and I reject completely the notion that there are cuts  to the overall aid budget, it is simply not true.

JOURNALIST:

Will the office of Treasury be investigating any sort of leak to the media on this story?

TREASURER:

I'm not aware of any investigations that are going on, but information has from time to time  been disclosed in inappropriate ways.  Those are legitimate matters for the Department, not  for the Minister.

JOURNALIST:

Tony Abbott had admitted to not reading the findings of the James Ashby and Mal Brough  involvement in the Slipper saga.  What's your take on Mr Abbott not looking at those  findings?

TREASURER:

He's a serial offender at not reading important reports which have very important conclusions  for the future of public policy.  It is extraordinary that he has not read the Ashby judgment  which makes damming conclusions about a colleague of his, Mr Brough.  I think there's a  real pattern of behaviour here emerging from Mr Abbott.  He went on national television said  that he hadn't read a report from BHP, even though he had made allegations and statements  about what was in the report, which were incorrect.  Mr Abbott is constantly at war with the  facts.  He will say anything and do anything, but he won't look at the available evidence or  the facts. And the facts in this case are that there has been a damming judgment of the actions  of Mr Brough, who is a candidate for the next federal election, and he has the gall to go on  radio and admit that he hasn't even bothered to read it.  It says a lot about Mr Abbott and his  approach to public policy.

JOURNALIST:

Mr Abbott has said that he's going to campaign alongside Mal Brough in the upcoming  election.  What do you make of that decision?

TREASURER:

I think it just indicates that the standards that Mr Abbott has are very low.

JOURNALIST:

Mr Swan, can you guarantee there will be no more fiddling with the AusAid budget this  financial year?

TREASURER:

What I can absolutely guarantee is that our AusAid budget is strong, increasing, and we're on  track to meet our GNI target. And I think everyone should be very, very confident that will  occur.

JOURNALIST:

On your visit to Townsville is there anything else that's concerning as far as the State  Government's cuts?

TREASURER:

Well of course the cuts are far wider than what's occurred here in health.  I think there's  something like 800 jobs in total which have been lost in Townsville through State  Government cuts, around 300 of those in health, so I'm very concerned about that, and I'm

concerned about the impacts on the individuals, I'm concerned about the impact on their  families and I'm concerned about its impact on the local economy.

JOURNALIST:

There's some concerns in terms of some medals being sent to fire-fighters who went over to  Christchurch to help out with the recovery there, that they won't receive the medals because  of a technicality, they weren't there for enough days.  Will there be reason to rectify that?

TREASURER:

I'm informed there's a review into the eligibility for this medal, that's a matter that's best dealt  with by the appropriate Minister.
