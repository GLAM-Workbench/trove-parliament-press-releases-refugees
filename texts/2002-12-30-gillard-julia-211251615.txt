GILLARD CONDEMNS CRIMINAL BEHAVIOUR AT   THE BAXTER & PORT HEDLAND DETENTION CENTRES

The Shadow Minister for Population & Immigration, Ms Julia Gillard, today  condemned the criminal behaviour of deliberately lighting fires at the Baxter and  Port Hedland detention centres.  Whatever complaints asylum seekers may have  there is no excuse for such criminal and destructive behaviour.

Australian Federal Police will be investigating these incidents.  The outcome of that  investigation should be made public so it is clear what has happened and who is  responsible.  Those who have committed criminal acts should be charged.

Such incidents put detention centre staff and other asylum seekers, including  children at risk.  It is important to identify who is responsible in order to protect  these staff members and asylum seekers.

In addition, local community members, particularly at Port Hedland, were alarmed  by the incidents and they need to be reassured by the Australian Federal Police that  all appropriate steps are being taken to ensure the security of local residents.

This incident is not the first such problem in Australian detention centres and clearly  there is a need to address security and other problems in detention centres.  Labor’s  comprehensive policy on refugee and asylum seeker issues, Protecting Australia and  Protecting the Australian Way deals in detail with a better way of dealing with  mandatory detention including:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Faster processing with 90% of claims determined in 90 days;  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ An independent Inspector General of Detention who could monitor detention  centre conditions;  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Getting children out from behind the razor wire; and  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Implementing better security and health checks.

The Howard Government should be implementing the changes advocated by Labor  in order to resolve on-going problems with detention centres.
