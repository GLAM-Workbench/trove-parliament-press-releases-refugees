MEDIA RELEASE



29 April 2017



VISIT TO THE UNITED STATES

The Minister for Immigration and Border Protection Peter Dutton travelled to the United  States from 26 to 30 April 2017 to meet with the Secretary of Homeland Security  General (ret) John F. Kelly and other key figures in the Trump Administration.

The visit provided an important opportunity to further deepen Australia - United States  cooperation on immigration and border security priorities.

Minister Dutton and Secretary Kelly discussed common challenges facing Australia and  the United States, including the global threats of terrorism, foreign terrorist fighters and  the illegal movement of people and goods across our borders.

Mr Dutton said that the United States is Australia’s preeminent partner and we are  working closely to achieve our shared commitment to the principles of sovereignty,  border integrity and managed migration.

“Our like-minded approach to border security, immigration and refugee screening  provides us with opportunities to cooperate closely, including through information and  intelligence exchange to combat illegal migration and the illicit drug trade,” Mr Dutton  said.

During his visit Mr Dutton also met with key senior United States Administration  advisers and Congressional Committee members to discuss bilateral immigration and  border security initiatives between the two countries.
