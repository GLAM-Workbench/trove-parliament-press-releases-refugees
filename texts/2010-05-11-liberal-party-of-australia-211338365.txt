INTERVIEW WITH PAUL BONGIORNO - CHANNEL 10 LATE NEWS - TUESDAY 11 MAY  2010

11th May 2010

E&OE………………………………………………………………………………………

Subject: Budget 2010

PAUL BONGIORNO:

Thanks for joining us Mr Hockey.

JOE HOCKEY:

Great pleasure Paul.

PAUL BONGIORNO:

Wayne Swan is promising to have the budget back in surplus within three years.  Can the Opposition  match that?

JOE HOCKEY:

Well his numbers are just simply not believable.  He assumes that they are going to have the best  terms of trade in sixty years.  They are going to sell more minerals than at any time.  They are going  to have more investment in resources than at any time - and even though they are putting a $9 billion  tax on the resources industry.  If you apply the same logic then there would be more people smoking  with the higher tobacco taxes.  It is just illogical.

PAUL BONGIORNO:

But aren’t his assumptions the assumptions you’re going to have to work with.

JOE HOCKEY:

Well we will see where we go with that.  But I can tell you what stunned me tonight is the  Government is going to have to spend nearly a billion dollars shoring up our borders for their failed  asylum seeker policy.  They are going to have to spend a billion dollars fixing up their pink batt  program.  Kevin Rudd promised no new bureaucrats in his hospital plan.  Half a billion dollars was  allocated tonight for new bureaucrats in the hospitals.  This is just another example of the reckless  spending.

PAUL BONGIORNO:

Well we are months out from an election, and obviously the opposition will want to shore up or  manifest its own credentials economically.  In sighting these examples are you saying these are things  you would target?

JOE HOCKEY:

Well in the first place we would not have to spend a billion dollars on border protection, because we  would have had the policy right in the first place.  Secondly, we never supported the pink batt  program - let alone having to spend a billion dollars to fix it up.  I think what you will see with us is  real action.  Direct action, not words.  You will see a real delivery of a surplus budget.  Kevin Rudd  and Wayne Swan will never deliver a surplus budget for Australia.  They never have, they never will.

PAUL BONGIORNO:

Well the tax rises that actually help pay, or help Mr Swan get to a surplus, it is a principle that you  really don’t quibble with is it? I mean after all you have got a 1.7% company tax rise to pay for the  parental leave.

JOE HOCKEY:

Every dollar of the levy we are putting in place will go especially to the mums out there who are  having babies.  Under the government’s plan every dollar of the mining windfall is going to be spent.   That is just illogical… This is a one-off benefit.

PAUL BONGIORNO:

(Inaudible)

JOE HOCKEY:

Well, that’s money that comes in and goes out.  They are not spending it.  They are not delivering it to  any future generation.  All they are doing is spending every dollar they are getting.  If the last mining  boom got us through the downturn, this government is strangling the next one.

PAUL BONGIORNO:

Mr Hockey thank you very much.
