PRESENTER:

Let's bring in our Big Guns of Politics - Environment Minister Tony Burke in Sydney and in  Hobart, Shadow Treasurer Joe Hockey. Tony, would a lottery be unfair to those relatives of  the original Anzacs?

TONY BURKE:

I think first thing we have got to note here is that no decision has been made. And no  decision can be made right now. We are still in a negotiation with New Zealand and Turkey.  Only 10,000 people will fit and obviously, there is going to be a much higher demand than  that this time. But in terms of working out what the arrangements are, we are in somebody  else's country. We need to work this out sensibly with Turkey, and New Zealand are in  those negotiations as well. There are lots of Australians who want to be there, and the  precise methods are something that we are still probably a couple of months from being  able to land exactly how it is done. But certainly, for what will be one of the most solemn  events ever for Australians, not everybody who wants to be able to get there will be able to  get there. How we manage that we haven't decided yet.

PRESENTER:

And Joe, I suppose, if you say let the relatives of those descendants have first go, whatever  is left over the public can go into a ballot, but 100 years on, the relatives of those  descendants could number in couple of hundred each? Couldn't they?

JOE HOCKEY:

Look Kochie, I agree with Tony there. Let's see how the process unfolds. Remember, we  had a lottery process to get tickets to the Olympics. But at the same time, there were tickets  that were allocated to families of Olympians and families of the Olympic family. So I am  sure they can get the balance right. I don't think, at this stage, people should be too  worried. I am sure the process can be dealt with.

PRESENTER:

Okay, thanks, Joe. Look, Federal Police say they didn't have enough evidence to hold an  alleged people-smuggling king pin. The man known as Captain Emad fled Australia earlier  this week after being identified on TV. Joe, how was he allowed to leave the country and  should he have been?

It is a good question, isn’t it. The federal government has cut $250 million out of the Federal  Police, and spent money in lots of other places, of course. But cut $250 million out of the  Federal Police. It is kind of surprising that it was another TV program that was able to  identify 'Captain Emad'. Frankly, the Minister needs to explain. If he did have the powers  why didn't he use them? If he didn't have powers, when is he going to introduce the laws  that are going to give him power to deal with the matter. But we have been on this program  talking about boats for a while. We have now had 50 boats arrive this year alone, and if  there were temporary protection visas in place which we have been arguing and which we  had  before, then he would have been thrown out of the country at the appropriate time or  there might be some other process available.

PRESENTER:

Tony, are you a bit embarrassed by all of this? Couldn't the police, or the government  advise the police, and say hold him for questioning until we get to the bottom of it?

TONY BURKE:

Look, on this one I only know what I read from the Australian Federal Police commissioner,  Tony Negus, in the paper today. Where he said there is a big difference between the  evidence you’d need for someone to be able to provide some information to a journalist and  what they believe would stand up in co and they were in a situation where they didn't  believe they had enough to charge. Now I don't have access to the evidence the way the  Federal Police do but if the police commissioner is saying they didn't have enough evidence  to be able to hold someone there, then I have no reason to not believe him.

PRESENTER:

OK, thank you, gentlemen, catch you next Friday.
