THE MINISTER  FOR THE

CAPITAL TERRITORY

The Minister for the Capital Territory, Mr Bob ELlicott', announced today

that 60 Government rental homes were being made available in Canberra to

house Indo-Chinese refugees.

Twenty of the houses had been made available for 12 families nominated by

the Indo-Chinese Refugees Association and eight by the Catholic Church

Movement. Under the arrangement these houses would be available for .

further occupancy by refugees when families who originally occupied them

moved into other Government accommodation after serving the normal f

waiting period.

The other 40 houses were available to the Catholic Church Movement under Â·

.  a scheme where the Movement was the recognised tenant. When the occupants

moved to other Government accommodation after serving the normal waiting

period the premises would revert back to the Department of the Capital

Territory and not be available for further occupancy by refugees.

Mr ELlicott said he was sympathetic to the needs of Indo-Chinese refugees

for housing and had asked the Department of the Capital Territory to

ensure that.these needs were kept in mind in relation to Government

rental accommodation in Canberra.
