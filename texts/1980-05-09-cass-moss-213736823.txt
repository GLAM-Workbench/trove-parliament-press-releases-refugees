PRESS RELEASE FROM MOSS CASSf M P f.  SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND

ETHNIC AFFAIRS" .  "  .

The report that the Australian Government decision to admit 200

Cuban refugees was an ad hoc one,  not based on any consultation with

the United Nations High Commission on Refugees (U.N.H.C.R.), should

be deplored, if true.

"The number of refugees to be admitted to Australia should be one.

that is based on consultation with that body. There is an increasing

number of refugees from countries all over the world, and it is

important to adhere to procedures established by the U.N.H.C.R. -

the co-ordinating agency for refugees.

"This is the only way we, in Australia, can administer a proper and

equitable approach to the world's refugee problem," Dr Cass said.

"No-one country should put precedents for this." ,

"The problem cannot go away and rich countries like Australia cannot

evade their responsibilities in this area," Dr Cass said.
