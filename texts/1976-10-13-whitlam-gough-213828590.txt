THAI STUDENTS

The Government 'has once again demonstrated its  callous indifference to the plight of Asian students affected  by violent changes of regime in their home countries.

Tonight I asked the Minister for Immigration and  Ethnic Affairs a question without notice seeking to elicit  from him an assurance that Thai students who feel endangered  by the coup d'etat in Bangkok will not be forcibly repatriated.

I asked him:

...In view of the sudden and violent coup d'etat which  has resulted in the overthrow of Thailand's democratically  .  elected Government, is the Minister aware that many Thai  students now in Australra are deeply concerned that their

lives or safety might be endangered if they were forced  to return to Thailand? Will the Minister therefore extend  to such students the same considerations as my Government  ,  .  extended to those Vietnamese and Cambodian students who

felt endangered by the changes of government in their  countries last year, that is, will he allow those .

,  who are due to return to Thailand after completion of their  studies at the end of this year to iremain in Australia for  the time being?

.  His response was an attempt to make cheap political  capital out of the question. Towards the end of his answer,  it dawned upon him that there was perhaps a real humanitarian  problem involved and he undertook to make enquiries from his

Department as to whether any Thai students were concerned about  having to return to a country where last week more than sixty of  their colleagues at Thammasat University were butchered by police

He maintained he had not heard of any concern expressed  by Thai students in Australia.

ÃÂ He 7^'ounded surprised at the very suggestion that Thai

students might be worried by the turmoil and bloodshed in their

country - a mere six days after every major newspaper in

Australia carried front page photographs of students in

Bangkok being lynched, beaten, shot and burned. -  - '  Â·

.  :  If his own perceptions are so imperfect, he might at

least have been expected to have been advised that Thai- .

students have been quoted oh television and in the newspapers .

voicing their fears about the change of regime. .  .

They have telephoned my office and 1. find it hard

to believe they have /contacted his office or his Department. .

.  His air.of wounded innocence tonight was all the more

reprehensible because six days ago I asked him a related question

on the subject of the coup in Thailand. It concerned the .

Government's attitude to potential refugees. He refused to answer

that part of my question which dealt with the Thai refugee problem

Twice in one week he has refused ..to acknowledge-that '  .

a serious humanitarian problem faces the Australian Government

as a result of the coup d'etat. .

.  The Government's record on this entire question is

deplorable. The sole reference by the Government to this major .

upheaval in Thailand - one of our closest neighbours, one of

the few democratically elected governments in Asia, an ally of

the Liberal Country Party Government in the Vietnam War - the

only reference by this Government has been a facetious question by

the Member for Kennedy to the Minister for Defence designed to .

elicit a crude and tasteless joke at the expense of the people

of Thailand.

Let me now contrast this shameful performance with

the record of my Government when faced with a similar situation

concerning students from Vietnam and Cambodia last year.

Politically,Â· the situations are opposite; in human '  ‘ v  V  -

terms., they are the same. -

.  .  x Immediately~~Eallowing the sudden changes of Government

'in Vietnam and Cambodia, I announced on 3 April that students

from those two countries would be allowed to defer their return

home. .  Â·

.  We followed this on 2 May with an announcement that a

special fund had been established’to'"provide living allowances

for Vietnamese and Cambodian tertiary students in Australia.

The allowances operated separately from the Tertiary Education

Assistance Scheme. "

.  On 11 November,the Minister, for Labor and Immigration

in the elected Government, (Senator James McClelland) announced .

that Government-sponsored students from Vietnam and Cambodia

were eligible for resident status whether or not they had completed

their studies - a 'signficant departure from previous practice.

Our record was marked by understanding,  compassion,

and action.  .  '  .

The Fra.ser Government's record is one of ignorance.,

insensitivity and indifference. .

The votes of five or six hundred Thai students may not

effect the electoral fortunes of the Fraser Government; but

the inaction of the Fraser Government may well cost them their

lives.  .  Â·
