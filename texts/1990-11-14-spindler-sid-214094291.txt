"Australia's poor environmental record is no excuse for drastic  reductions in our migrant intake," Democrat Senator Sid Spindler  said in his address to the Melbourne Conference on Immigration,  Population Growth and the Environment.

"To close our doors in order to protect our own wasteful,

affluent lifestyle is in my personal view an unacceptable  position."

"Public awareness of conservation issues is moving ahead in leaps  and bounds. This is creating political pressure for Government  action which will continue with the conservation movement, social  justice groups and the Democrats moving towards a 'values  coalition' and a united electoral strategy."

"It is clear that action on air and water pollution, land

degradation and the urban environment will increase our capacity  to sustain more people."

"We must take a global view, realise that we are part of the  world community and not hide behind our atrocious past record on  environmental issues as an excuse for a selfish 'Fortress  Australia' approach."

"Australia's overseas aid must be directed towards containing  future population growth, but that does not relieve us of the  obligation to people who are disadvantaged now, particularly  refugees and family reunion migrants," Senator Spindler  concluded.
