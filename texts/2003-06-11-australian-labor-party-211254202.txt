Speech by Mark Latham, Member for Werriwa, at the  Melbourne launch of his book, From The Suburbs, at the  Eltham Bookshop, 11 June 2003.

_____________________________________________________________



This is a book about the forgotten people: the people without power,  influence or assets in the vast suburbs and regions of our nation.  It’s a book  about the new dividing line in public life: the struggle between the insiders  and the outsiders.

Under the Howard Government, power has been concentrated in the hands  of the few, not the many.  This is a government for the insiders, for political  appointments and cronyism.

Labor’s task is to break down this power-elite, to disperse economic, social  and political influence as widely as possible.  Our job is to re-enfranchise the  outsiders.

With the rise of globalisation, our role has become more important.  Too  much economic power is concentrated in the hands of big corporations -  companies that want all the rights of free trade and investment, yet few of  the responsibilities of good corporate citizenship.

In part, this has led to the shocking level of asset inequality in Australia.   The top 20 percent of households own 65 percent of the nation’s wealth,  while the bottom 20 percent owns nothing at all.  The Howard Government  has no strategy or policies for dealing with this imbalance.  In fact, it never  mentions poverty as an issue.

Under Howard, the old boys club is back in town.  The power-elite in  Sydney and Melbourne passes on an expensive education and extraordinary  wealth to the next generation.  This is why the insiders’ network is so strong  - its members look after each other with appointments and preferment.  Too  much power is concentrated in the hands of too few people.

This is reflected in the Government’s appointments to major cultural  institutions, such as the ABC.  The Prime Minister’s best mate is Donald  McDonald, so Howard made him Chairman of the ABC.  Peter Costello’s

best mate is Michael Kroger, so he put him on the board of the ABC.  If  Tony Abbott had any mates they’d be on the ABC board as well.

This is how it works under the Howard Government.  It’s a real insider’s  job.  Howard’s instincts are authoritarian.  His preferred form of government  is a one-man-band.

Look at his appointment of Peter Hollingworth as Governor General.   Instead of opening up the process to the Australian people and inviting a  wide range of nominations, Howard thought he knew best.  So he appointed  someone who had failed to take action against a known paedophile.  This is  the dark side of conservative politics: the arrogance of one-man government,  the arrogance of old Tory men and their 1950s view of child abuse.

Look at Howard’s record on immigration policy.  At the last election he said  that he would decide who comes into Australia and under what  circumstances.  At the same time Phillip Ruddock was taking campaign  money from the one of the biggest corporate crooks in the history of the  Philippines, while also helping him with his Australian citizenship.

Ruddock also received a $100,000 donation from a Buddhist Monastery but  says he knew nothing about it.  The Buddhists say that every long journey  starts with a single step.  In the Liberal Party of Australia, a successful visa  application now starts with a single donation - a $100,000 donation.

Howard does decide who comes into Australia, with Liberal Party donors in  the fast lane.  All those misguided asylum seekers.  Instead of paying the  people smugglers $10,000, all they had to do was pay Ruddock’s election  campaign.  Instead of being sent to Nauru, they could have had dinner with  Ruddock, Tony Abbott and Ross Cameron.

So too, look at the way in which Howard committed our country to the war  in Iraq - no public consultation, no binding parliamentary debate, no respect  for due process, just a mad rush to say YES to the United States.  And now,  just like the Kids Overboard, a cover-up about the weapons of mass  destruction.  The United States Congress and the British Government are  holding inquiries into how their intelligence agencies got it wrong, but not  the Howard Government.

Howard’s record on democratic reform is just as bad.  It’s another one-man-band.  No independent Speaker of the House of Representatives.  No reform  of the parliament and its committee system.  No community cabinets or  public consultation.  No experiments with Internet democracy or deliberative  democracy.  And no Republic, let alone a democratically elected (that is,  directly elected) Australian President.

Let’s not forget, this was the Prime Minister who single-handedly tried to  write the preamble to the Australian Constitution.  He wants an Australia in  his own image and the political power to make it happen.  In truth, Howard  doesn’t trust the Australian people.  That’s why he never involves the public  in the decisions of his government.  He’s for the powerful, not the people.

Labor’s role is to attack this system, to re-empower the outsiders by shifting  assets and influence into their hands.  Wherever power and privilege are  concentrated - whether in the boardrooms of big business, the pretensions of  high-society or the arrogance of big bureaucracy - we need to be anti-establishment.

The outsiders want us to shake the tree, to rattle the cage on their behalf.   They want us to be less respectable and less orthodox, breaking down the  powerful centre of society.

My book talks about how this can be achieved.  It sets out a Labor agenda  for economic ownership, corporate social responsibility, positive welfare  reform, housing and urban policy, plus opening up the political system for  greater public participation.

We need to reactivate the high ideals of citizenship in our society, with all  citizens as stakeholders.  That is, an inclusive community in which all  Australians have the financial capital, human capital and social capital to  lead fulfilling lives.

I wrote this book to give a policy view From The Suburbs, but also to do a  bit of straight talking.  The Australian political system has become too  sanitised.  In Canberra, we have too many white-bread politicians, too many  machine men, too many spin doctors and too much pollie-waffle.

What’s wrong with a bit of straight talking and straight-shooting?  After all,  the Tories hate it when we go straight at them.  They say that Labor is no

longer a working class party but they go into a spin whenever they hear a bit  of larrikin language.  It’s all there in the last two chapters of the book.

Modern Labor

I’m proud to be From The Suburbs and proud to be part of Simon Crean’s  frontbench.  Despite the current controversy, the Federal Party is heading in  the right direction.  Under Simon’s leadership, we now have a policy  agenda.  The small target strategy has been consigned to the dustbin of  history.  The True Believers, at long last, have something to believe in.

Too often since 1996 people have said to me: what are the differences  between Labor and Liberal?  Now the answers are crystal clear:

ÃÂ¦ In international affairs, we don’t want a world in which one country  has all the power.  We want Australia to have an independent foreign  policy, not one contracted out to Washington.

ÃÂ¦ On health policy, we want to save Medicare and restore bulk-billing.   Only Labor believes in public health care, and without public health  care there can be no Medicare.

ÃÂ¦ In education policy, we want to restore affordability and accessibility.   The Liberals believe in a system with $150,000 university degrees.   Labor believes in a different system: one in which bright kids from  public housing estates can get a good public education, all the way to  a higher education.

ÃÂ¦ On the environment, we want to ratify the Kyoto Protocol and save  the Murray/Darling.

ÃÂ¦ In the corporate sector, we believe in social responsibility.  The  golden handshakes, the lavish executive salaries, the disregard for  worker entitlements, the corporate rorting and the insider deals must  end.

ÃÂ¦ Finally, Labor wants to restore the public’s trust and confidence in  democracy itself.  This is why we have announced an ambitious  agenda for modernising Australia’s constitution and political system.

In short, Simon Crean has set out more policy in a couple of months than we  released in the previous six years.  And the public response has been  positive.  We are very competitive in all the published polls.  If not for the  destabilisation campaign of the machine men in the Party (and they are all  men) then we would now be in front and well on the way to winning the  next election.

In the current leadership contest, Simon Crean and Kim Beazley have said  that they want a positive debate and I respect that approach.  My concern is  for the unity of the Party.

If the push against our Leader were to succeed, it would set a shocking  precedent.  This long campaign of leaking, backgrounding and sabotage  would be legitimised within the ALP.  This is not the Labor way.

Simon Crean is a tough and determined person who has been willing to  stand up to the machine men.  This is why they turned against him.  They  like soft and indecisive leaders with whom their interests will always  prevail.  A North Melbourne Shin-Boner is a bit too tough for them.

For many years it has been said that the factions are no longer a good guide  to the big debates within the Party.  I think this is true.  The new divide is  between the True Believers (those who want modern Labor to stand up and  fight for our policy beliefs) and the Machine Men, with their over-reliance  on polls, spin doctors, the daily media cycle and a command-and-control  style of politics.

Earlier I said that the ALP should be anti-establishment.  The danger with  machine politics is that it drains the Labor movement of energy and belief.   It reduces our Party to a bland form of Labor conservatism.  It replaces the  passion and radicalism of Labor with a ‘whatever it takes’ approach to  public life.

Simon Crean has shown great honour and decency throughout this process.   He believes in the ethics of Labor, he believes in doing things the right way.   That’s one of the reasons why he’ll prevail on Monday.

Conclusion

It’s a great honour to represent Labor in the Australian Parliament.  It’s a big  thing to vote in a Labor leadership ballot.  It takes my memory back to when  I joined the party at Green Valley Branch in Sydney’s western suburbs in  January 1979.

One the of waterside workers at the meeting, a great salt-of-the-earth fella  gave me a badge that read, “Unity of Labor is the hope of the world.”  Good  advice then.  Good advice for all of us, once we get through next week and  get back to the real work of Labor: defeating the Howard Government and  implementing our agenda, our mighty crusade for a more just, tolerant and  independent Australia.
