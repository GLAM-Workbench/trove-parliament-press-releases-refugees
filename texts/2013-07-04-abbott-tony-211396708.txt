COLIN BARNETT:

Good morning and thank you for coming to Mandurah.

Tony, can I thank you not only for visiting Perth and Western Australia but for coming to Mandurah and the Peel region. This is a

very rapidly growing area in terms of population, about 80,000 people, and behind us of course is an aquatic centre that was built  in the early 1980s when the population was only 20,000 people. It has worked well, it is very popular - young kids having

swimming lessons, seniors doing fitness and physio classes - but it is time for redevelopment.

The City of Mandurah has put $10 million into the project. The State Government has put about $13 million in. But we are still  short and fortuitously, Tony, you are here and you have the solution to make it up. So look,  I will hand over to you. Welcome to

Mandurah and I think all the people there were terribly excited to see you here today and you have had a great reception in Perth  over the last couple of days including the event last night and you have great support here and I wish you well, Tony.

TONY ABBOTT:

Thanks so much, Colin. Thank you so much.

Well, I'd like to thank the Premier for making me so welcome here in Western Australia. I'd like to thank Don Randall the Member

for Canning where we now are, and Donna Gordin the candidate for Brand which is 500 metres down the road for all of their hard  work on behalf of local people.

As the Premier has said, this is a very rapidly expanding area. It's grown massively over the last 20 and 30 years. This facility -

which was an excellent facility 30 years ago - now needs to be upgraded and I'm pleased to say that an incoming Coalition  government will commit $10 million to stage two of the upgrade here. You are only in a position, though, to make the kind of local

investments that we will make here if you get a strong economy. And we get a strong economy by cutting down on unnecessary  and low priority spending so that we can target spending on the things that really need it. The social dividend of a stronger

economy will be a better aquatic and recreation centre here in Mandurah. That's what it's all about in the end. We need a stronger  economy so we can have stronger communities. We need a stronger economy so that every Australian can have a better life.

That's what I'll be talking about every day between now and the election - our Real Solutions plans to give Australians the better  life that they have a right to expect; to restore the hope, reward and opportunity that Australians have a right to expect.

I'm going to ask Donna to say just a few words about the importance of this facility to the local area and then obviously I'm very

happy to take questions and I imagine you'll want to ask me about Mr Rudd's trip and his latest announcement about the  corruption inside the Labor Party in New South Wales and I'll deal with that at question time. But first of all, over to you, Donna.

DONNA GORDIN:

Thank you Tony and Premier. I want to thank you for coming to the Peel region. It is an exciting day for Mandurah and the

surrounding suburbs. This is a great example, this project, of local, state and federal, all three tiers of government working  together to get better outcomes for locals in our communities and I want to congratulate the city of Mandurah for the work that

they've done and the benefits to this community are not just for families with children, it is for our seniors, it is for those that aspire  to a healthier way of life and better outcomes, so, thank you for your time.

Thanks so much.

MAYOR PADDI CREEVEY:

Mr Abbott, firstly thank you very much for coming to Mandurah. You are very welcome here. We know the work that’s been done  by Don Randall and Donna and to you Premier for the support we’ve had from the State Government. This facility has over

600,000 visits a year. It has done us well. We are a growing community, we know the need, you have addressed the need and we  thank you for that.

TONY ABBOTT:

Thanks Paddi. Ok, do we have any questions?

QUESTION:

Will you take up Mr Rudd's offer to debate him at the National Press Club next Thursday on debt and deficit?

TONY ABBOTT:

I am only too happy to debate Mr Rudd and if he wants to recall the Parliament, I’ll be in Canberra next week to debate him every

day in the Parliament. If he wants to actually begin the election campaign, obviously I’ll be only too happy to participate in an  election debate. My challenge for Mr Rudd is to turn up to the National Press Club next Thursday and give a considered speech

about all the policy changes that he is going to make; how the Government under him will be different and better than the  Government under Julia Gillard because so far it's been all talk and no change.

QUESTION:

Just to be clear, you’re rejecting his offer unless he calls an election?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, the fact is he is now the Prime Minister. Is he governing or is he campaigning? Is he making change or is he just engaging in

silly stunts? This thing next Thursday is just a silly stunt unless he is prepared to stand up and explain to the Australian people  exactly what his policy agenda is.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, what do you have on next Thursday that you wouldn't take up the opportunity to tell the Australian people about such

an important issue?

TONY ABBOTT:

I have been talking with the Australian people every day for the last three years; every day that's exactly what I am doing. I  released a book late last year for A Stronger Australia. I've released our Real Solutions plan earlier this year. For three years, the

Australian people have had the same strong team and the same clear policies from the Coalition. From Labor, twice now, the  Prime Minister has been dragged down by a caucus. We've had six small business ministers. We have had five assistant

treasurers. We have had four immigration ministers. But still the deficits keep growing, the boats keep coming, the division and the  dysfunction persists.

QUESTION:

Opposition Leaders usually jump at the chance for a debate, they usually call for three of them. Why are you so hesitant? Is it true

you do lack ticker?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, as I said, what Mr Rudd should do if he wants a debate - recall the Parliament, I'll debate him every day. I think he is too  frightened of his caucus to recall the Parliament. Name the date. Start the campaign. I will debate him every day. I think he is too

frightened of the people to do that. So, this is a Prime Minister who is running scared of the caucus and the people and I say, if  he’s fair dinkum, let's bring back Parliament, or let’s end the suspense, name the date, get on with the campaign so the Australian

people and not the faceless men of the Labor Party can once more claim the government and own the prime ministership.

QUESTION:

12/11/2013 http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/22487/20130903-0148/www.tonyabbott.c...

You won't debate him until he calls the election date?

TONY ABBOTT:

He can recall Parliament. If he wants me to be in Canberra next Thursday, he can recall Parliament, we'll both in the Parliament

and we'll debate to his heart's content.

QUESTION:

What harm will come from you attending this debate?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, this is not about Mr Rudd's ego. It’s just not about Mr Rudd’s ego. The government of this country should be about what's in  the best interests of the Australian people, not what is best calculated to pump up Mr Rudd's ego.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, is the Australian dollar falling good or bad for the economy?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, what we need is good economic management and that's what we haven't had from this government. The best thing the

Government can do to strengthen the Australian economy is get its spending under control and that's the last thing that we are  going to see under Mr Rudd because Mr Rudd started the spendathon which squandered the fiscal inheritance that he had from

the last Coalition government.

QUESTION:

The fact that Mr Rudd and Mr Burke have both conceded their initial policies in terms of immigration in 2009 were probably  mistaken, is that quite encouraging now that we can now move forward; you’re probably both on the same page now?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, Mr Rudd is the best friend that the people smugglers have ever had. Mr Howard stopped the boats. Mr Rudd started the

boats. Mr Howard put the people smugglers out of business. Mr Rudd has given the people smugglers back their business model  and I say to Mr Rudd, if you are fair dinkum about this trip to Indonesia, you can immediately take the advice of President

Yudhoyono some time ago, take the sugar off the table, immediately reintroduce temporary protection visas, because if you don't  reintroduce temporary protection visas, the 20,000 illegal boat arrivals who are about to be processed will all get permanent

residency in Australia. What kind of a signal does that send to the people smugglers and their customers? When you go to  Indonesia, you have two tasks: start the cattle boats, stop the people smuggling boats and I fear Mr Rudd will fail at both of them.

QUESTION:

Mr Rudd says you are no more than slogans. What do you say to that?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, if Mr Rudd is fair dinkum, he will tell us exactly how government under him is going to be different and better than it was

under Julia Gillard and indeed under him the first time around. Let's not forget that last time I faced Mr Rudd, he was sacked for  incompetence and dysfunction by his own party, and while we're on the subject, we now have this so-called change in New South

Wales. Well, this isn't a corruption cure, this is an election fix. Let’s never forget that Mr Rudd was quite happy to be installed by  the faceless men. Then, of course, the faceless men sacked him. Now, he is happy with the faceless men because they have put

him back and all we have seen today is that for just 30 days, just 30 days, the faceless men in Canberra will be giving directions to  the faceless men in New South Wales. It is just a joke. The only way to clean up the Labor Party is to give them time out in

opposition so they can get their house in order.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, Premier Barnett is seeking significant Commonwealth funding for some rail projects in WA. You have previously said  that won't be coming from your government. Is that still your position?

12/11/2013 http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/22487/20130903-0148/www.tonyabbott.c...

TONY ABBOTT:

I am looking forward to working very closely with Premier Barnett if we win the election. I'm looking forward to continuing with the  Perth Gateway project. I am also talking to the Premier about some other major road infrastructure projects in Western Australia

and I'll have more to say about them in the run-up to the election.

QUESTION:

So, no money for rail?

TONY ABBOTT:

If we can give more support to major road projects, obviously that makes it easier for the State Government to invest in significant  rail projects. The thing about urban rail is that the urban rail systems are run by the states, they're owned by the states and that's

why I think they are fundamentally a state responsibility.

QUESTION:

That goes against what's happening at the moment with the Federal Government putting a lot of money into the City Link rail  project which is about dropping a rail line there. You are sort of going back on what has been long-held.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, that's not quite right. The only federal government which has put money into urban rail as opposed to freight rail has been

the current Labor government. The commitments that are already under way will continue under a Coalition, but we think the  priority for the Commonwealth Government is rail freight - as opposed to urban rail - and major national roads.

QUESTION:

Would you divert the $500 million that's been set aside in this year's Budget towards a public transport project in WA?

TONY ABBOTT:

The important thing is, as I have pointed out, existing commenced projects continue. The Commonwealth under a Coalition

government will be focused on freight rail and on major national roads.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott what about the GST? Again, Julia Gillard made it clear that there would not be any more money for Western Australia  under the GST carve-up. Is that still your position that won't change under your government as well?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, I want to really commend Colin Barnett for the way he has fought Western Australia's corner on this. It's very important that

Premiers stand up for their state and no Premier has been a more powerful advocate for the state than Colin Barnett has been for  the West. My job is to do what's in the national interest and the last thing I want do is to dud any state and certainly I've given a

clear indication that the financially weaker states won't be worse off under the Coalition and the Coalition has no plans to change  the GST which, after all, is a state tax and for anything to change, all of the states would have to agree.

What I do want to do, though, should we win the election, is have a good, long, hard look at how our Federation can be improved.

Within two years of a Coalition government taking office, there would be a comprehensive White Paper on reforming our  Federation, making our Federation function more effectively. I've got to say that this state here has done a lot of very good things

which the other states could well emulate. I particularly congratulate Colin and his team on independent public schools which are  a marvelous model of how we can get more rigour, more parental involvement, more principal autonomy into public schools.

I want to see a better functioning Federation and that's what you'll see under a future Coalition government.

Thank you so much.
