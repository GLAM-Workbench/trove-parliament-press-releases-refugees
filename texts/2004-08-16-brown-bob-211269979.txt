PM lied to 20 million Australians - he should resign

The revelation by defence adviser Mike Scrafton that he told Prime  Minister Howard there was no evidence for his 'children overboard'  claims before the 2001 election is damming, Greens Senator Bob  Brown.





"Mr Scrafton's claim makes our Prime Minister a deliberate liar: not  a liar in the public interest but a man prepared to lie to 20 million  Australians to promote his own hold on the job. He should resign,"  Senator Brown said.

"Politicians are human and so can err. But self-serving deception of  the nation on the eve of an election is unforgivable in the nation's  leader."

In the run to the 2001 poll, Senator Brown repeatedly queried  government statements vilifying asylum seekers arriving by boat,  in particular the claims that children had been thrown overboard.
