E&EO…………………………………………………………………………………………..

RAY HADLEY:

Every Thursday we attempt to speak to the Immigration Minister Peter Dutton. He's  just touched down in the last couple of hours in Washington DC. The Immigration  Minister's on the line. Minister, good morning.

PETER DUTTON:

Good morning, Ray.

RAY HADLEY:

You're there meeting with your US counterpart, Secretary for Homeland Security  John Kelly. What will the discussion be all about?

PETER DUTTON:

Well there is a lot to discuss and I had the chance to meet General Kelly, as he then  was, in Canberra in December. There's a lot of information that we exchange; as you  know at the borders foreign fighters coming back from overseas, lots of information  to share and we're doing a lot of work within the counter-terrorism space.

So I'm looking forward to the meeting and it will be a good chance to talk about our  new citizenship arrangements, what we're proposing there and I think the US has got  an interest in how we've been able to pull that together, what we've been doing in  terms of border crossings and it's a pretty important relationship in this current  environment. We've got no better partner than the United States.

RAY HADLEY:

Now given that you're talking to the Secretary for Homeland Security, the equivalent  to the Minister for Homeland Security, there's reports today that you are likely to be  the first person appointed to that position in the federal ministry. Have you got a  comment on that?

PETER DUTTON:

Ray look, there's been lots of speculation around for a long period of time. As I’ve  said before, all of that machinery of government stuff is an issue for the Prime  Minister, but obviously the Government’s keen to do whatever we can to make sure  that we continue to stare down the threat. The agencies have done a great job in  thwarting a number of attempts to cause death and mass casualty and as a country  we should be very grateful for all of the agencies. They all work well together.

Those sorts of issues, in terms of the workings of government, how those ministries  work, as you know, is really an issue for the PM.

RAY HADLEY:

Okay. Last week we had the Vice President Mike Pence here saying he would  honour that deal that had been put in place by the Obama Administration to transfer  those people from Nauru and from Manus to the United States of America. Will that  be also part of what you'll discuss this week, how that will progress?

PETER DUTTON:

It's not the main focus because the deal's been done to President Trump and Vice  President Pence's credit. They’ve said that they'll honour the deal that was struck  between Prime Minister Turnbull and then President Obama. So it's all going well.  Officers from the Department of Homeland Security and State from the US have  been on both Nauru and Manus. So those interviews continue and we're confident  that there'll be no hold up, it will all work well and the sooner we can get people off  the islands the better.

RAY HADLEY:

Now Manus Island; this happened from the time I went away on that Good Friday  into Easter Monday and you may or may not be aware of the words of Andrew Bolt  on Sky News last night where he described your discussions as being a little loose  with the truth. However, he condemned your opponents as liars.

You've said PNG officers fired shots into the detention centre because they were  concerned about the welfare of a five year old who was allegedly led into the centre.  The ABC reported comments by the local Police Commander which suggest that the  boy was in fact older and there was no concern for his welfare.

Now, Andrew Bolt said last night that you have seen vision that others have not seen  and that's why you criticised the ABC Insider host Barrie Cassidy in questioning you.  Are you still standing by what you said to Barrie Cassidy on that day?

PETER DUTTON:

One hundred per cent Ray and what I've said is that; certainly over a long period of  time there have been a series of events - and the Commissioner for Australian  Border Force has made some comment in relation to this today - we have seen  reports, we are concerned about some allegations of sexual behaviour by the asylum  seekers toward girls and women on Manus.

Just to get the geography in people's minds, Manus Island is a naval base, so there's  naval housing there with naval families, their kids running around, there's obviously  the village and the regional processing centre is part of that community. So with an  open centre arrangement, where the asylum seekers can come and go from the  Manus Island facility, they walk to the markets, they walk around the island and  obviously the housing for the naval staff is part of that.

So I was very clear in what I’ve said and I stand by it 100 per cent. I haven't deviated  from it at all and I won't because I know what I've said to be factually true. So that's  the reality.

Now, if the ABC and Fairfax want to take particular stances and take the word of  other people, who I think are discredited, over the word of an Australian Government  Minister, then that's really an issue for the ABC, for the national broadcaster.

I think the ABC's frankly demonstrated their capacity again in relation to one of their  paid staff and their comments around Anzac Day and the ABC can answer for  themselves, but I think most Australians are pretty fed up with the attitude of some of  the ABC commentators. If they want to be politicians run for politics, run for a seat at  the next election, but don't prosecute your political disposition through the taxpayer  funded ABC. It's a frustration, but anyway, that's what we have to deal with and  they'll answer for themselves.

RAY HADLEY:

See I don't want to talk about this woman in detail - and you've had your say on it  both here this morning and yesterday in the media - but this social media posting by  the 26 year old woman; her parents chose our country as a safe haven from their  native Sudan. Now, I don't know whether the comments were borne out of attention  deficit syndrome where she seeks attention or just sheer stupidity, but I would have  thought any income she derives from the Federal Government or any statutory  authority should cease immediately.

Now, it was revealed to me yesterday, because I in some way said perhaps she  doesn't know the significance of Anzac Day. I was contacted by a fellow student from  a high school in your home state where she attended and said she was well aware of  Anzac Day when I attended school with her. She then was on a committee to  celebrate the centenary of the Anzacs which was put together in 2014 and of course

and we got to 2015 and she knew the significance of Anzac Day. She's now  apologised and withdrawn from it.

But it's also reported that she's on the stipend of some committee put together by  Julie Bishop. I mean so if we're going to talk to the ABC about, you know, taking  some action, what about your own Government taking some action in relation to the  stipend she receives for any work she may do for them?

PETER DUTTON:

Well Ray, I mean to go back to your first point…did she not know about Anzac Day?  Of course she knew about Anzac Day. She's an educated woman and she made a  comment which was I think all about publicity seeking.

Now I don't want to add to her publicity seeking venture, but I do seek to call into  question frankly the management of the ABC when they tolerate this ongoing…they  almost sacked a female presenter only a couple of weeks ago from the ABC for a bit  of an on-air gaffe which was really here nor there, but they laid down the law to that  particular presenter simply because she wasn't prepared for when the camera  crossed back to her, and yet this person, who's on the ABC payroll has made a  comment in her capacity. I think it's unacceptable and I don't understand how the  ABC can continue to justify the long line of these people that they employ, that they  engage.

They can question the Government, the fourth estate, it’s an important part of our  democracy, media has a very important role to play, but when these journalists turn  themselves into advocates and players and political operatives, then I think they  shouldn't be doing that on taxpayers' dime and I think that's something the ABC  needs to answer for - and in terms of…I'm not aware of the Foreign Affairs  element…

RAY HADLEY:

Well I mean she holds some position it's reported today where she receives a  stipend via Julie Bishop's department and what I'm saying to you and to the  Government is; if it's good enough to call out the ABC, well it's good enough to call  yourselves out and for you to say well, if she is getting money from us, a Federal  Government that should cease immediately.

PETER DUTTON:

Well Ray, I don't believe she should be paid anything from the Federal Government,  that's my personal view. It's an issue for the Foreign Affairs Minister and perhaps the  role she's performing that she's being paid for, DFAT believe that that's valuable, but  my experience of having observed this particular individual, as I say, pains me to talk  about it because she is just seeking publicity and unfortunately we are giving it her,  but that's the way it is.

I think we just need to call out the comments that she's expressed on what is the  most sacrosanct day of the Australian calendar and on a day when many veterans

are doing the right thing; commemorating the loss of those that have gone before  them and for all the insensitive remarks…the way they were projected through her  own publicity reasons, is just completely unacceptable.

RAY HADLEY:

Now one of the things you and I spoke about recently is these detention centres; I  nominated Villawood and you know, you weren't surprised that I received information  from Villawood because people are allowed to have contact with the outside world -  it's not a jail, it's a detention centre - but there's a story today in The Telegraph and  in News Limited papers; criminals awaiting deportation based on character grounds  are there; many of them belonging to outlaw motorcycle gangs, they've got access to  mobile phones which we understand, but apparently they’re using them to run drug  operations and even plot the odd murder from inside Villawood. Are you aware of all  of this?

PETER DUTTON:

Well I've tried to stop the mobile phones from being used in the detention centre. I  think the matter is before the court at the moment. I’ve been injuncted from doing  that, so there a couple of issues I think Ray from that story.

It really goes to the changing population. So as we’ve stopped boats and people  have been returned back to their country of origin or released from detention,  obviously the number of refugees or asylum seekers within our detention network  has dropped right down and the numbers have ramped up because - as we've  discussed on many occasions - we've dramatically increased the number of visa  cancellations of outlaw motorcycle gang members and criminals.

So the population within the detention centre now is predominantly people that have  committed crimes, that are being deported because of the crimes that they've  committed and so we're dealing with a much hardened population than what we had  before. So there's that issue that's raised.

We've done a lot of work with the Commissioner and the Australian Border Force,  intelligence officers around raids, gathering information, seizing contraband items  and the rest of it and all that work will continue, but the frustration otherwise is the  endless court process that's involved here in some of the reviews - and this is more  so around some of the asylum seekers who just…and one of the cases we spoke  about on your programme only a couple of weeks ago with the family that had been  here I think for 17 years from Fiji, and you go through these endless legal processes.

My view is simple; if the Department determines that somebody is not owed  protection, then they should have their day in court for it to be independently looked  at through the court process. Once that is at an end, then frankly people should be  preparing to depart, but instead we end up with this prolonged period where we have  to pay to keep these people in detention; it's a stalling tactic, taxpayers' end up  paying millions and millions, hundreds of millions of dollars to all of these matters  over the forward estimates, that we deal with in the Budget, and I could be spending  that money elsewhere within either stopping boats or stopping terrorism.

All of those aspects, which is a huge frustration - and there's a lot that we're looking  at in this space and we should talk more about it because as I say people should  have their fair day in court - but the taxpayer shouldn't be taken for a ride and at the  moment I believe that they are.

RAY HADLEY:

Okay, one final thing, I know you're busy, but this is something that's been brought to  my attention by one of my listeners in your state, your state of Queensland. We had  this discussion previously about, particularly in relation to the disaffected youth-  refugee youth in Victoria, and when you can say enough is enough, you're going  back from whence you came.

A Victorian teen who groped eight teenage girls, eight, and a woman while swimming  in a predatory manner - that's the judges word, not mine - has avoided conviction  and walked from court with a probation order. The teen can't be identified as he is an  Afghani refugee who came to Australia from Pakistan without a birth certificate. After  being charged as an adult, the teen was assessed based on development  milestones that he could not prove or the prosecutor couldn't prove his date of birth.

So they didn't know whether he was an adult or a child, so he was charged as a  child. He pleaded guilty to nine counts of sexual assault, three counts of common  assault on women aged 15 to 24 while he was on holidays; January last year. He did  not have a conviction recorded, was sentenced to two years’ probation for the  conduct described in court as pre-meditated and persistent.

Now, the Judge David Kent QC said the teen had been swimming in a quite  predatory manner and persisted to touch the women for a period of almost two hours  before being reported to lifeguards on the beach. Yet, there's no…you can't do  anything about this bloke, whether he's 16 or 26, we don't know how old he is  because there's no conviction recorded.

PETER DUTTON:

Well this is the frustration I'm talking about and I don't know the details of the  particular case, but this is why it was important Ray for the announcement that the  PM and I made last week about the citizenship as well.

People who want to become Australian citizens, regardless of their background,  whether they’ve come here as a refugee or on a working visa, whatever it might be; if  you're going to conduct yourself like this, if you believe that you can't abide by our  laws and you can't adopt our values, then you won't be getting Australian citizenship  - and that is at the heart of what we've been working really hard toward.

I think it's been a good decision and we'll talk more about it over the coming months,  but it is absolutely essential that people of this character don't become Australian  citizens because we end up spending millions of dollars on these people going  through the criminal legal justice system and above and beyond that, more

importantly, they leave a trail of victims behind and we just don't want those people  in our country.

RAY HADLEY:

Okay, thanks for your time; we'll talk to you next week.

PETER DUTTON:

Thanks Ray. See you mate.
