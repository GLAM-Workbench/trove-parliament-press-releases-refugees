MINISTER WELCOMES BRITISH DECISION

"The Australian Government warmly welcomes the decision

by the British Government to provide an undertaking in relation

to the refugees who arrived in Darwin on Tuesday on the tanker

Entalina," the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs,

Mr. Michael MacKellar said^today.

The Minister Was commenting on the terms of an announced

British decision that they would accept for ultimate settlement in

the United Kingdom any refugees not accepted for resettlement by

other Governments.

"This decision reinforces in a most helpful way the growing

international co-operation between major maritime powers and

governments of resettlement", Mr. MacKellar said.

It was likely that other countries would be asked by UNHCR

to resettle the refugees.

"For our part, Australia would consider the resettlement

of refugees in the group who met Australian requirements," the

Minister said.

The Australian Government was already in contact with the

representative of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees

in Australia who would be handling overall arrangements for the

resettlement of the refugees.
