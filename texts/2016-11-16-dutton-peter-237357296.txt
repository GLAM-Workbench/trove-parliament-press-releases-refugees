E&EO…………………………………………………………………………………………..

PATRICIA KARVELAS:

Peter Dutton is the Federal Minister for Immigration and Border Protection and he  joins us now on RN Drive. Hi Peter Dutton.

PETER DUTTON:

Hi Patricia.

PATRICIA KARVELAS:

The Fair Work Commission in 2010 and an independent report commissioned by the  Government in 2014 recommended a 90 day period so that's why it happened. Why  ignore this advice now?

PETER DUTTON:

Well Mr O'Connor who was then the Employment Minister in the Gillard Government  flagged concerns with the 457 visa toward the end of the Gillard Government. We  commissioned an independent review, had a look at aspects of the 457 visa  programme and we've made some of those changes.

But Patricia why we are talking about it now is because it's a red herring that's been  thrown up by Bill Shorten to try and distract away from the Labor Party's division over  the Bill that we've got before the Parliament and Mr Shorten still has 26 members  within his own ranks who have spoken out against the Bill. And frankly it's a pretty  tardy effort to try and distract away from that division within the Labor Party. So that's  why we're talking about it at the moment. I think that's why it's come up from Mr  Shorten in the last 48 hours.

PATRICIA KARVELAS:

When you're referring to the Bill you're talking about the lifetime ban on refugees, is  that the Bill you're referring to?

PETER DUTTON:

Yes.

PATRICIA KARVELAS:

Right. So you're saying Labor's raised 457’s so they're not talking about this Bill?

PETER DUTTON:

Of course and that's a deliberate strategy. The trouble is that Mr Shorten's kicked a  massive own goal because in the end there were more 457 visas issued under his  time as Employment Minister than any other Minister prior to him or any of his  successors. So Mr Shorten had a huge increase in the number of 457 visas issued  during his time as Minister…

PATRICIA KARVELAS:

…sure and Mr Shorten's response to that has been that the labour conditions have  changed dramatically since then. Of course you know with the mining boom the  conditions were pretty different and of course employment conditions do change so  conditions need to meet the visa.

PETER DUTTON:

But there's a great graph that's going around at the moment which shows the ANZ  job index flat lining during Mr Shorten's period as Employment Minister and yet there  being a massive spike in the number of 457 visas issued. All I'd say is don't look at  what Bill Shorten says look at his track record, what he's done. And at the moment I  think he's running this big con-job of saying look over here, look at the 457 issue that  I want to bring up because I saw some benefit politically in pursuing this to try and  distract away from his own ways. I just think people should call it out for what it is.

The issue that we're dealing with at the moment is to try and get women and children  off Nauru, but to do it in a way that doesn't restart boats.

PATRICIA KARVELAS:

Okay I understand that, but today the Government has continued the conversation  on 457s, you've announced these changes. I know they were gazetted in late  October so why re-announce them today? You're saying Labor is using this issue to

distract away from the lifetime ban of asylum seekers, but you're also doing the  same thing.

PETER DUTTON:

I just think Patricia it's important to point out that even though Mr Shorten's trying to  create this big distraction he's actually been caught out lying about the facts. And so  we've pointed out the fact that it went from 28 days to 90 days under Labor and on  the recommendation of the committee would've reduced it back to 60. It was  gazetted in October, so it was no big issue and Mr Shorten has misrepresented the  position. And why has he done that? Because he's desperate to try and distract  away from the division of the Labor Party on border protection policy and their  division continues up to this very day.

And the problem for us is as a country that people smugglers will be hearing this  message and what I don't want is a repeat of the deaths at sea and new arrivals  filling the vacancies that we're creating in the regional processing countries.

PATRICIA KARVELAS:

On that issue - I'm really interested in this argument you're making - do you have  any evidence yet that the people smugglers are getting a mixed message? I know  you're trying to exert maximum political pressure on Labor to vote for your Bill saying  that, you know, the US deal should have this other side, this hard line law, but  where's the evidence that they are hearing this and that they're changing their  business practices?

PETER DUTTON:

Well Patricia there are 16 agencies and government departments that are involved in  Operation Sovereign Borders, including our intelligence agencies, so I'm not going to  go into all of the detail.

But I can tell you that the people smugglers have a very sophisticated social media  network. They have the ability to text and message out to would be customers, to  innocent women and children and men who are being coaxed to pay money to get  onto a boat and they respond within hours. They look at what Premiers say, they  look at what the Prime Minister says, what I say on the topic and I'm out there …

PATRICIA KARVELAS:

…okay do you have any specific advice that your agencies have given you saying  that Labor saying they won't support these laws is giving them some kind of belief  that they should bring back the boats?

PETER DUTTON:

Patricia I'm just not going to go into it, but all I can say to you is that they follow and  they respond within hours of the words said by Australian political leaders. They  follow it very closely because they use it as a marketing tool and as a marketing  opportunity and that advice, that intelligence has been consistent for a long period of  time.

These are sophisticated organised criminals, they are trading in human beings,  which is just for them another commodity, they move onto guns or they move onto  drugs or they're running prostitutes, they're involved in sexual servitude. The people  that they move on boats are just another commodity and they are terrible evil people  and they are sophisticated. They do monitor what we say. When I say that we've got  2,000 children out of detention and closed 17 detention centres, they're out there  messaging saying if you've got children, pay now, hop on the boat…

PATRICIA KARVELAS:

But the language you've previously used about using a country - in the past New  Zealand was the one we often talked about - is sugar on the table that people will be  able to market and say you'll get to the US. That's what you're worried about. So how  are you trying to combat that message? I mean it has to be more than just this  lifetime ban as well because at the moment they're hearing that these people will get  to go to the US?

PETER DUTTON:

Well we've been very clear in saying to people that are on the regional processing…  or in the centres at the moment or out in the community in Nauru or Manus, they are  the only people that this deal applies to. So, new arrivals will not under any  circumstance be going to the United States. We've messaged that out. There are  other ways in which we communicate and get messages out across networks and all  of that has been undertaken. I mean this operation has been in the planning for  many months and we intend for it to be executed successfully.

I don't want women and children drowning at sea again, I don't want kids in detention  in Australia again and we need to provide the best opportunity to take people out of  the detention centres without new arrivals filling the vacancies.

So there are many aspects to the work that we're doing including messaging into the  region. We've done that successfully in Operation Sovereign Borders before and we  need the people smugglers to hear a very clear and consistent message…

PATRICIA KARVELAS:

…okay, are you …

PETER DUTTON:

…both from the Prime Minister and the alternative Prime Minister of this country.

PATRICIA KARVELAS:

Are you confident you can get the laws, the changes through now without Labor  anyway?

PETER DUTTON:

I don't want to rely on the independents or anyone else. This is a job for Labor. We  don't have a balance of power problem in the Senate if the Labor Party steps up to  the mark.

And Mr Shorten proudly said during the campaign and since that he's on a unity  ticket with Malcolm Turnbull when it comes to border protection policy - well nothing  can be further from the truth.

And this is why this 457 distraction shiny ball has been thrown out there because he  knows that he's made the wrong decision, he knows that he's had 26 members who  went out opposing the Bill before he could open his mouth and I think this is a real  problem for Mr Shorten and we need the Labor Party to step up, not the  independents, because the people smugglers are watching what he says…

PATRICIA KARVELAS:

…but either way you need to get your laws through. You might want to say that, but  you need to get your laws through. So Labor's made it clear they don't want to vote  for them, have you got another pathway through?

PETER DUTTON:

Well we can talk about tactics another day. I mean that’s an issue for us, but …

PATRICIA KARVELAS:

…but do you think you can get the laws through without Labor because that's their  position?

PETER DUTTON:

I think the laws must get through to give us the best opportunity to stop boats. And at  the moment we're weakening our position as a nation because of the division on this  issue and I think that is a green light to people smugglers and I think that is a  complete disaster put forward by Mr Shorten and I think he should review his  position.

Peter Dutton, in an interview earlier today the Prime Minister said Gillian Triggs  would not continue as President of the Australian Human Rights Commission after  her term is up next year. Is that a decision that's been quietly made by the Cabinet  which the Prime Minister announced or was that his own decision?

PETER DUTTON:

Well Patricia as you're an astute observer of politics you'll know that A, I don't  comment on Cabinet discussions and B, it's an issue for Senator Brandis and the  Prime Minister. I've made my views well known in relation to Professor Triggs. Now I  don't think it would surprise anyone to say that she's not going to be renewed for a  second term in that role. I don't think that would come as a surprise to anyone.

PATRICIA KARVELAS:

No it's not a surprise at all to me, but what's a surprise is that the Prime Minister said  it, so I'm wondering what the process has been. Were you aware that she was not  going to be renewed? I mean was that what you expected?

PETER DUTTON:

Well, as I say, I'm just not going to comment on Cabinet discussions, what was  discussed there or not. It's an issue for Senator Brandis as the responsible Minister  and for the Prime Minister.

PATRICIA KARVELAS:

Has the Government's criticism of Professor Triggs made the job a bit of a poison  chalice?

PETER DUTTON:

I think in the end people create a rod for their own backs or they create great  opportunity in these positions. I mean these are highly paid positions. They come  with a great deal of responsibility. People need to conduct themselves in accord with  high office that they occupy and people will make their own judgements about  Professor Triggs and others that have been appointed by previous government.

I think this Government's been very clear in our position. We've been concerned and  disappointed on a number of fronts, but again it's an issue for others to debate.

PATRICIA KARVELAS:

Peter Dutton, thank you for joining me.

PETER DUTTON:

Thanks Patricia, all the best. Thank you.
