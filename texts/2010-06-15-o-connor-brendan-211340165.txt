Vessel intercepted by Border Protection Command  15 June 2010

HMAS Armidale, operating under the control of Border Protection Command, intercepted a  suspected irregular entry vessel south west of Ashmore Islands this afternoon.

The vessel was initially detected by a Dash 8 surveillance aircraft, operating under the control  of Border Protection Command.

Initial indications suggest that there are 33 passengers and three crew on board.

The group will be transferred to Christmas Island for security, identity and health checks, and  their reasons for travel will be established.

While their nationality is yet to be confirmed, if these asylum seekers are Sri Lankans or  Afghans, the processing suspension introduced by the Government on 9 April 2010 will  apply.
