E&OE……………………….…………………………………………………………………

TONY ABBOTT:

Thanks everyone for coming. I want to thank Mel and Mal at Paragon Printing for allowing us to tour the  premises, to meet the workers and to understand some of the issues that they will face if Julia Gillard’s  carbon tax goes ahead.

This is a business which currently pays about $180,000 a year in electricity alone. Under Julia Gillard’s  carbon tax that’s about $40,000 to $50,000 a year more in electricity alone, that’s before you pay more for  transport, before you pay more for everything else because this is a tax that cascades through the economy.  So what this means is everything you buy which is printed, whether it’s your newspaper, whether it’s your  wedding invitations, whether it’s the menu in a restaurant, the price goes up and up and up.

The other thing, of course, that I should say is that if the price of printing in Australia goes up we won’t use  less printed products, we will just import more from China and elsewhere. This is an industry that suffers  fierce import competition. So, not only will the price go up for consumers but tax payers’ jobs will be  exported overseas.

The final point I should make before throwing to Greg is to say that the printing presses will be running with  Government propaganda shortly. This is a Government which lied about a carbon tax before the election and  now it’s going to use tax payer funding to advertise. So, they didn’t tell you the truth before the election.  Now they’re going to use your money to advertise their broken promise. It really is a sign of a Government  which has no competence and no honesty.

Greg?

GREG HUNT:

Thanks Tony. I’d like to pick up where Tony left off in terms of honesty from the Prime Minister. The Prime  Minister is trying to say that it will be a small number of big companies that will pay the tax. That is false. It  is dishonourable. It is dishonest. It is incorrect. This firm Paragon will have an electricity bill increase of

between $40,000 and $50, 000 which is a worker’s job in the first three years. If, as is likely, we’re likely to  see a much higher increase - that is more jobs and that’s before we get to the cost of paper. So, the price of  the Prime Minister’s electricity, petrol and gas tax will be felt by every worker, every family, every  household and the Prime Minister should be honest about that.

The second point in terms of honesty is in terms of what the Prime Minister is saying about China. The  Prime Minister is trying to imply that Chinese emissions are going down. They are not. China is currently  increasing its consumption of coal from one and a half billion tonnes in 2002 to four billion tonnes in 2015.  It is going through the fastest, biggest growth in the use of coal in the history of humanity. There is no  honesty from the Prime Minister. She should be honest that families and small businesses will feel the pain  of electricity prices and she should be honest about the fact that China is going through the fastest increase  in the use of coal in human history.

TONY ABBOTT:

Ok. Any questions?

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, do you think that Kevin Rudd is the reason why Labor has improved in the polls?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, I think that polls go up and down but what is constant is the dishonesty and the incompetence of this  Government. I look at the field evidence not the polls and the field evidence is that this Prime Minister said  before the election, “there will be no carbon tax under a government I lead”. She flagrantly has broken faith  with the Australian people. If she’s changed her mind, fine, but she should seek a mandate at the next  election rather than trying to get this parliament pass a tax that she wasn’t truthful about.

QUESTION:

Why are you doing so poorly in the polls? Why is your vote so low if people don’t want this carbon tax?

TONY ABBOTT:

The fact is that I think right around Australia people are increasingly conscious of the fact that you can’t  trust this Government. Everywhere you look there are broken promises from this Government. Broken  promises on the carbon tax, broken promises on the climate change peoples’ convention, broken promises  on the mining tax, on the hospital takeover. Even the tax summit involves a broken promise as to its timing  and its content. So, this is a Government which simply cannot be trusted.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, is there are warning for the Coalition in this polls, about the campaign [inaudible] approval  rating?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, I think it’s very important that I speak out on behalf of the Australian public, to protect and defend  them from bad taxes based on a lie. We all know that Australian families are struggling with massive cost of  living increases and this Government’s tax hikes, the carbon tax, the mining tax, are just going to make a  bad situation worse. Now, someone had to stand up for the Australian public. It’s not always popular to call  things for what they are but someone had to do it and that’s the Opposition Leader’s job.

QUESTION:

Tomorrow thousands of people are going to be turning up for the no carbon tax rally. Are you in support of  this rally?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, I think the Australian public have a right to make their voices heard. My understanding is that all sorts  of people will be turning up at Parliament House tomorrow to take all sorts of different positions but  certainly I’m looking forward to an opportunity to talk to people at Parliament House tomorrow about the  Coalition’s position and the Coalition’s position is that the best possible tax cut is not to have a carbon tax  on your power, on your petrol, on your gas and on your groceries.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott will you put your name behind that rally? Are you going to be there speaking officially?

TONY ABBOTT:

I would hardly speak unofficially. I hardly stop being the Leader of the Opposition when I stand up to speak  depending upon the circumstance. As I said, I will be taking every opportunity I have to honestly put  forward our position. I tell you what you’ll never see from me: the kind of dishonesty we’re about to see  from this Government with a tax payer funded advertising campaign. The printing presses will be rolling at  tax payer expense to justify this Government’s broken promise.

QUESTION:

Just to be clear, will you attend that rally or will you speak at that rally?

TONY ABBOTT:

My intention is to attend the rally and my intention is to speak at the rally.

QUESTION:

Are you endorsing it?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I’ll certainly be speaking, I’ll be saying my piece and my piece is that under the Coalition the best tax  cut you can get is no carbon tax on your power, on your petrol, on your gas and on your groceries.

QUESTION:

Are you confident that Campbell Newman can beat Anna Bligh at the Queensland state election?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, I think that the Coalition should win the next election. I think the Coalition has done a good job and I  think that matters internal to the Coalition should be decided in Queensland.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, on the mining tax, do you think that that should be deferred until after the tax summit so it can  be on the table and discussed there and who do you think really brokered the deal with the big mining  companies?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think it makes no sense at all to have a tax summit that can’t discuss the most contentious issues of the day.  I think that a serious, credible government thinks first and decides subsequently, thinks first and acts later. I  think the idea of the Government introducing a mining tax, introducing a carbon tax and then having a tax  summit that can’t discuss these things is a sign that we do not have an adult government. Now, as for the  mining tax compromise I think it’s pretty obvious that the grounds that the Prime Minister gave for  politically executing Kevin Rudd are spurious. Plainly she said nine months ago that the Government had  lost its way and she nominated three areas where the Government had to find its way, on climate change, on  the mining tax and on boat people. On each three of those issues things are going from bad to worse.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott when are we going to get a final position from the Coalition on the fuel excise? Specifically on  LPG and on ethanol?

TONY ABBOTT:

When we see a final position from the Government you’ll see a response from us.

QUESTION:

On Christmas Island, what do you make of these warnings? Six months ago the Government was told about,  you know, the possibility of riots.

TONY ABBOTT:

I think this is a Government which has completely lost control of detention centres, just as it’s completely  lost control of our borders. This is a Government which has effectively sub-contracted out to people  smugglers a significant element of our immigration policy. On all of these issues, whether it be climate  change, whether it be border protection, whether it be the National Broadband Network shambles in the  making, the Coalition has strong and effective policies. So what you’re seeing from the Coalition is, sure, a  strong critique of polices that are failing, but behind that critique a strong alternative policies that would  actually do the job.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, on Christmas Island do you think there will be a significant difference between the treatment of  the detainees would have got on Christmas Island and the treatment they will get on the mainland?

TONY ABBOTT:

The important thing is that you’ve got to stop the boats. If you can’t stop the boats you’re going to have to  people in detention. Some of them will be in detention on Christmas Island, some of them will be in  detention on the mainland. But if you can’t stop the boats, you can’t get people out of detention and  obviously the best thing we can do is to have policies in place that stop the boats. The interesting thing,  though, about the Government’s latest decisions to move people en masse from Christmas Island to the  mainland is that you are giving the people smugglers more to offer their customers. What the customers of  the people smugglers want is to get to Australia and that’s precisely what this latest change by the Gillard  Government is going to give them.

QUESTION:

On carbon tax compensation, are you worried about the prospect of going to the next election rolling back  pension increases and tax cuts?

TONY ABBOTT:

There is no way that you can properly compensate people for the seismic impact of this bad tax. There is just  no way that you can do it and let me make it absolutely crystal clear that a tax cut to compensate for a tax  hike is not a cut, it’s a con. If every household is paying something like $2,000 per year more thanks to the  carbon tax and it’s getting say $1,000 back, that’s not a tax cut. That’s a tax con.

QUESTION:

So you will roll back those tax cuts, along with the carbon tax?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I  simply echo the point that Joe Hockey has been making that if you don’t have the tax you don’t  need the compensation and I stress that there is just no way that you can adequately compensate people for  the seismic impact of this carbon tax on your power, on your petrol, on your gas and on your groceries and if  there is one thing which epitomises the fundamental dishonesty of this Government it is the pre-election lie  that they are now going to try to obscure with the post-election tax payer funded propaganda campaign. The  printing press should stop when it comes to this dishonest tax payer funded propaganda campaign.
