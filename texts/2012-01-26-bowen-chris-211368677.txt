CONGRATULATIONS TO SECRETARY ANDREW METCALFE ON  ORDER OF AUSTRALIA AWARD

The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Chris Bowen MP, today congratulated Department of  Immigration and Citizenship Secretary, Andrew Metcalfe, who was made an Officer of the Order of  Australia (AO) for meritorious service to immigration and the wider public service.

"I would like to congratulate Mr Metcalfe on this honour, which is a genuine recognition of his service  to successive governments over a long and distinguished public service career," Mr Bowen said.

“It is fitting that Mr Metcalfe's AO was awarded on Australia Day as he has made a significant  contribution to Australia’s highly successful migration program, citizenship program, and multicultural  and refugee resettlement programs.”

The minister also congratulated the department’s special advisor to the secretary, Martin Bowles, who  was awarded a Public Service Medal (PSM) today.

"Mr Bowles recently joined my department in advance of being appointed as acting secretary when  Mr Metcalfe takes a period of long service and study leave from April to September this year," Mr  Bowen said.

"Mr Bowles' PSM is a reflection of the significant contribution he made at the Department of Climate  Change and Energy Efficiency, from which he came to my department."

Mr Metcalfe joined the public service in 1980 and has been secretary of the Department of  Immigration and Citizenship since July 2005. In 2010, he was named 'Federal Government Leader of  the Year' in the Leadership in Government Awards supported by the Institute of Chartered  Accountants Australia.

He has been involved in public sector and community work, including as a board member of the  National Australia Day Council since 2002; as the current President of the Institute of Public  Administration Australia (ACT Division); as the patron of EXPAND, an Australian public sector-wide  network of executive assistants and personal assistants; and other significant roles such as being a  White Ribbon Ambassador.

"This award is also a tribute to the dedicated staff in my department who serve the Australian  community from within Australia and in around 60 overseas locations," Mr Bowen said.

"They often work in challenging and complex circumstances, and I thank them for their hard work  and dedication.”  Media Contact: Laura Stevens 0432 833 769
