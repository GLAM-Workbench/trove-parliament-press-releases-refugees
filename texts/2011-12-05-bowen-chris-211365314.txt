MINISTER BOWEN TO CO-CHAIR UNHCR 60TH  ANNIVERSARY MEETING IN GENEVA

The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Chris Bowen MP, will depart Australia today for  Geneva, Switzerland to co-chair a ministerial level meeting convened by the United Nations  High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the  Refugee Convention.

Mr Bowen will address both the UNHCR ministerial meeting and the 100th session of the  Council of the International Organization for Migration (IOM), which is also celebrating its  60th anniversary.

“I am pleased to have the opportunity to co-chair a meeting that will bring together ministers  from all over the world in support of the principle of providing protection for those fleeing  persecution, enshrined in the Refugee Convention,” Mr Bowen said.



“I have personally worked closely and constructively with UNHCR and IOM over the past  year. The Australian Government recognises the good work of both organisations, in often  difficult circumstances, to provide essential support to people in need.”

As part of the Australian delegation, Mr Bowen will be accompanied by Mr Robert Mulas,  Principal of Fairfield High School in western Sydney, and two young brothers, Daniel and  Ameer Saeed, who came to Australia from Iraq and were resettled under the offshore  humanitarian program.

“Around 40 per cent of Fairfield High School’s student body is comprised of refugees and the  school does valuable work with refugee students and their families,” Mr Bowen said.

“I invited Mr Mulas and the Saeed brothers to join the Australian delegation to showcase all  the good things that are happening in Australia in terms of our resettlement of refugees and  integration of people into our community.

“It is important to recognise the community work that is done every day around Australia by  people such as Mr Mulas, who has co-ordinated a world’s best practice resettlement program  for refugee students, parents and the local community.”

Mr Mulas will give a presentation to the UNHCR Resettlement Service and other interested  states on the school’s settlement and integration program. Fairfield High School student  Ameer Saeed and his brother Daniel will also participate in the presentation to UNHCR.

While in Geneva, Mr Bowen will also hold meetings with ministerial counterparts and with UN  High Commissioner for Refugees AntÃÂ³nio Guterres.  Media Contacts: Bill Kyriakopoulos 0400 510 802 / Laura Stevens 0432 833 769
