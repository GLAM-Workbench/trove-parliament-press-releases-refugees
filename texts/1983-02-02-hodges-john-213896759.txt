SPEECH BY THE HON J.C. HODGES, M.P. , MINISTER FOR

IMMIGRATION AND ETHNIC AFFAIRS TO LAUNCH THE AUDIO-VISUAL

SERIES "NEIGHBOURHOOD LIVING": FAIRFIELD CITY COUNCIL,

WEDNESDAY 2 FEBRUARY 1983 AT 9 AM.

THE LAUNCHING HERE TODAY Of THE AUDIO-VISUAL SERIES

"NEIGHBOURHOOD LIVING" IS THE CULMINATION OF ALMOST TWO

YEARS OF CLOSE CO-OPERATION BETWEEN YOUR CITY COUNCIL, THE

RESIDENTS OF FAIRFIELD AND SURROUNDING AREAS, FILM

AUSTRALIA AND MY DEPARTMENT.

YOU WILL RECALL, THE IDEA FOR THE "NEIGHBOURHOOD LIVING"

SERIES ORIGINATED IN DISCUSSIONS HELD BETWEEN OFFICERS OF

MY DEPARTMENT AND MEMBERS OF THIS COUNCIL, WHO WERE

CONCERNED ABOUT THE LACK OF KNOWLEDGE IN THE COMMUNITY OF

THE ROLE PLAYED BY LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND OF THE SERVICES IT

OFFERS TO THE COMMUNITY. IN PARTICULAR, MEMBERS OF THIS

COUNCIL WERE PERTURBED BY THE EVIDENCE OF A LACK OF

UNDERSTANDING BY NEWCOMERS OF THE NORMS OF LIVING IN AN

AUSTRALIAN SUBURBAN ENVIRONMENT.

A NEED WAS SEEN TO PROVIDE NEWLY-ARRIVED MIGRANTS AND

REFUGEES WITH INFORMATION IMPORTANT TO THEIR SUCCESSFUL

SETTLEMENT IN AUSTRALIA; ESPECIALLY INFORMATION WHICH

WOULD ASSIST THEM IN GAINING ACCEPTANCE INTO THE HOST

COMMUNITY AND PREVENT THEM FROM GETTING INTO SITUATIONS,

HOWEVER UNWITTINGLY, WHICH WERE LIKELY TO PROVOKE

ANIMOSITY TOWARDS THEM

* . '

AN AUDIO-VISUAL PRESENTATION WAS SEEN AS BEING THE MOST

USEFUL MEDIUM TO CONVEY SUCH A MESSAGE BECAUSE IT IS

FLEXIBLE ENOUGH TO BE USED IN A RANGE OF EDUCATIONAL ,

SETTINGS BOTH FORMAL AND INFORMAL, AND, WITH MODERN .

EQUIPMENT, CAN BE MADE READILY AVAILABLE TO INDIVIDUALS ON

A SELF-ACCESS BASIS.

IT WAS SEEN FROM THE OUTSET THAT WHILE THE SERIES

ORIGINATED IN FAIRFIELD, IN RESPONSE TO LOCAL NEEDS, ITS

CONCERNS COULD WELL BE APPLICABLE TO ALL COMMUNITIES IN

AUSTRALIA WHERE MIGRANTS AND REFUGEES ARE SETTLING. IT

WAS, THEREFORE, AGREED THAT IN PRESENTATION THE CONTENTS

SHOULD BE OF A SUFFICIENTLY GENERAL NATURE TO PERMIT USE

AUSTRALIA-WIDE.

AT THIS POINT, THE ADVICE AND ASSISTANCE OF FILM AUSTRALIA

WERE ENLISTED AND FIELD RESEARCH WAS CONDUCTED TO IDENTIFY

THE TOPICS TO BE COVERED. THE OUTCOME, AS YOU WILL SEE

SHORTLY, IS A SERIES OF ELEVEN SEGMENTS ARRANGED IN THREE

"CLUSTERS". THE FIRST CLUSTER COVERS CHILD CARE,

IMMUNIZATION PROGRAMS, COMMUNITY CENTRE.FACILITIES AND

SERVICES, GARBAGE DO'S AND DON'T1S , AND FAMILY RECREATION.

THE SECOND CLUSTER COVERS EMERGENCY SERVICES, RENTING

ACCOMMODATION, TENANCY PITFALLS AND RESPONSIBILITES,

2 .

EXTENDING THE FAMILY HOME, AND STARTING A SMALL BUSINESS

ÃÂ¨  s

Â·- Â»

THE FINAL SEGMENT DEALS WITH NEIGHBOURHOOD NUISANCES:

THOSE NOISY, UNSIGHTLY, UNHEALTHY, DESTRUCTIVE OR DANGEROUS

PROBLEMS WHICH SOMETIMES OCCUR, HOWEVER UNINTENTIONALLY,

WHEN PEOPLE OF DIFFERENT CULTURAL BACKGROUNDS ARE SETTLED

IN CLOSE PROXIMITY.

THE PEOPLE YOU WILL SEE IN THIS SERIES ARE NOT

PROFESSIONAL ACTORS AND ACTRESSES, BUT REAL PEOPLE : .

RESIDENTS O F .THE FAIRFIELD AREA. FILM AUSTRALIA HAS

REPORTED THAT THE CO-OPERATION FROM RESIDENTS OF THE

FAIRFIELD COMMUNITY IN MAKING THE SERIES WAS LITTLE SHORT

OF OVERWHELMING...IT APPEARS THAT A BONUS IN MAKING THE

SERIES HAS BEEN THE POSITIVE CONTRIBUTION IT HAS MADE TO

FOSTERING HARMONY IN THE COMMUNITY. CONSIDERABLE POSITIVE

PUBLICITY WAS GIVEN BY THE MEDIA TO THE MAKING OF THE

SERIES AND FILM AUSTRALIA HAS ESTIMATED THAT ABOUT 870,000

PEOPLE SAW REPORTS ABOUT IT ON TELEVISION ALONE.

THE SERIES WILL BE AVAILABLE IN A NUMBER OF ETHNIC

LANGUAGES - VIETNAMESE, KHMER, LAO, CANTONESE, POLISH,

SPANISH AND ARABIC - AND WILL BE DISTRIBUTED TO OUTLETS IN

ALL STATES. THE INTENTION IS THAT IT SHOULD BE USED IN

MIGRANT RESOURCE CENTRES AND MIGRANT CENTRES AS WELL AS

BEING MADE AVAILABLE TO COMMUNITY GROUPS THROUGH REGIONAL

OFFICES OF MY DEPARTMENT. CARE HAS BEEN TAKEN TO ENSURE

THE VIDEOS ARE COMPATIBLE WITH EXISTING EQUIPMENT AT

3 .

SELECTED LOCATIONS

4

SUPPORTING WRITTEN MATERIAL IS BEING PREPARED TO REINFORCE

THE MESSSAGE IN EACH OF THE ELEVEN SEGMENTS AND THIS ACTS

AS AN "AIDE-MEMOIRE " FOR VIEWERS TO TAKE AWAY AFTER THEY

HAVE SEEN THE VIDEOS.

I BELIEVE THAT THE "NEIGHBOURHOOD LIVING" SERIES IS A

SIGNIFICANT ADDITION TO A BROAD PROGRAM OF SERVICES

AVAILABLE BOTH THROUGH MY DEPARTMENT AND THROUGH STATE,

LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND COMMUNITY ORGANISATIONS AIMED AT

MEETING THE NEEDS OF NEW SETTLERS IN AUSTRALIA. ALL OF

THESE SERVICES RECOGNISE THAT PEOPLE ARRIVING IN AUSTRALIA

COME FROM MANY DIFFERENT CULTURAL ENVIRONMENTS AND

DIFFFERENT SOCIAL AND POLITICAL SYSTEMS IN WHICH QUITE

DIFFERENT COMMUNITY OBLIGATIONS AND RIGHTS PREVAIL. AS A

RESULT, NEWCOMERS FACE A RANGE OF NEEDS WHICH ARISE

DIRECTLY FROM THEIR STATUS AS MIGRANTS AND REFUGEES.

THE SERVICES PROVIDED BY MY DEPARTMENT WHICH ARE

SUPPLEMENTED OR REINFORCED BY THE EFFORTS OF STATE AND

LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND BY ETHNIC AND VOLUNTARY

ORGANISATIONS ARE ALL IN RESPONSE TO THIS NEED. AN

IMPORTANT ASPECT OF THIS MULTIPLICITY OF SERVICES IS THE

FOSTERING OF A SPIRIT OF SELF-HELP AMONG NEW SETTLERS AND

THE "NEIGHBOURHOOD LIVING" SERIES, WITH ITS POTENTIAL FOR

SELF-ACCESS, IS "A" MOST WELCOME ADJUNCT TO THIS CONCEPT.

MY MAYOR, IT NOW GIVES ME GREAT PLEASURE TO PRESENT

TO YOU AND TO THE FAIRFIELD CITY COUNCIL THE FIRST SET

OF THE "NEIGHBOURHOOD LIVING" SERIES. I HEAR THAT YOU

PLAN TO PUT THESE TAPES TO VERY GOOD USE. I UNDERSTAND

THAT THE FIRST SEMINARS WITH GROUPS OF MIGRANTS USING

THE SERIES ARE TO BE HELD HERE THIS AFTERNOON. I REGARD

THIS SERIES AS TANGIBLE PROOF OF WHAT CAN BE ACHIEVED

THROUGH THE CO-OPERATION OF ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT,

THROUGH COMMUNITY EFFORT AND THROUGH THE WILL OF ALL

TO FOSTER HARMONY AMONG THOSE WHO HAVE-SETTLED IN

AUSTRALIA. I AM CONFIDENT THAT THESE TAPES WILL GO

A LONG WAY TO ACHIEVING THIS GOAL.
