Text of a message sent by the Prime Minister earlier   today to each State Premier:

"You will be aware of my Government's concern that   Australia should play its part in helping to alleviate   the hardship and suffering now being endured by the people   of South Vietnam.

The adoption by Australian parents of numbers of   Vietnamese children has been a note-worthy aspect of our   past contribution to the relief of this suffering in the   past and I should therefore be grateful if in the light

of the rapid escalation of the human problems in South '   Vietnam in recent days you could now ask your regulatory   authorities to make special efforts to finalise as   expeditiously as possible decisions on applications by

residents of your State for permission to adopt  Vietnamese children.

The Australian Government for its part will endeavour   to facilitate the entry of such children for whom approved   parents are selected and who^South Vietnamese authorities   have granted authority to leave.

E.G. WHITLAM"
