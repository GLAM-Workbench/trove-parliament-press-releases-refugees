The Council members paid tribute to the memory of Sir  Robert Menzies, They recalled the leading role he had played  in the formation of ANZUS and his commitment to the closest ties  among the ANZUS parties. (

The three countries reaffirmed their common commitment to  the democratic traditions and practices that provide'the enduring  foundation for their long and close friendship. They undertook  toÂ· continue to work together to promote their shared interests.

The Council members expressed their satisfaction with the  close ties among the partners. They noted that these had been  strengthened in the past year by fruitful visits of the Australian  and New Zealand Prime, Ministers to Washington and of the American  Vice President to Canberra and Wellington.

The Ministers reaffirmed the great importance that each  member attaches to the ANZUS alliance as an element in the  framework of Western security and a means of maintaining and  developing the individual and collective capacity of its members  to resist armed attack. Pursuant to these primary concerns the  Ministers recognised the central importance of practical coÂ­

operative supply and support arrangements within the alliance  which would facilitate the expansion of Australian and New Zealand  forces in contingent,circumstances. The Ministers, welcomed the  progress made in thej planning and conduct of combined military

exercises as a means'' of strengthening military co-operation and  testing its effectiveness.

development in the Asia-Pacific region. The Minister stressed  the particular importance of Japan in regional and global affairs

and emphasised the importance of Japan's efforts to increase  domestic demand and reduce its trade surplus. The Council noted  that the developing relations between the People's Republic  of China and many countries of the region enhance the prospects  for regional stability. It expressed support for continued . efforts to normalise the relations between the United States  and the PRC. The Ministers expressed the conviction that  the important progress made by the Republic of Korea1s armed  forces would allow them to assume a greater role in the defence  of that country with continuing support to be provided by the  United States. The Ministers supported the Republic of  Korea's call to North Korea for a resumed dialogue as a first

step toward peaceful solution of the Korea question.

The Council welcomed the contribution the Association  of South-East Asian Nations has made to regional economic and  social development and expressed confidence that the organisation  would be of even greater importance in the future. In particular,

the Council members supported the expansion of ASEAN's dialogue  with non-member countries. The Council saw the continuing  moves toward mutual understanding and closer co-operation among  South-East Asian countries as an element in the development of

regional stability.

’  The Council members reaffirmed their intention to continue -to play major roles in ensuring the permanent resettlement of  the refugees whose flight from the countries of Indochina continues.  They expressed their gratification with the role many other nations

are playing in this effort and their hopes that national programs  for receiving refugees would be expanded. They also expressed  their, appreciation of the important role being played by the  United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in alleviating

suffering and misery. They called on his organisation to renew  its efforts to achieve improvements in first asylum practices  throughout South-East Asia and to persuade other nations capable  of resettling refugees to provide permanent homes for them. During  their discussion, the Council members reiterated their deep  concern regarding violations of human rights in Kampuchea.

The Ministers commended the continuing steps toward  political and economic co-operation being made by the States of  the South Pacific and expressed their support for efforts to  form a South Pacific Regional Fisheries Agency. They noted that

the membership of Australia, New Zealand, and the United States  in such an organisation would enhance its contribution to regional  economic development.

They noted with interest the statement of principles for (   free association signed by the United States and the Micronesians,  the encouraging prospects for the evolution of close relations  among the parties on a new basis, and the plan for a July 12

referendum to be observed by the United Nations in which Trust  Territory citizens will express their views on the organisation  of their future governmentÂ»

The Council reviewed the negotiations between the  United States and the Soviet Union aimed at an agreement limiting  their military presence in the Indian Ocean that would enhance  the security of the partners and all countries in the Indian  Ocean region. The Ministers agreed that the balance of military  presence of the United States and the Soviet Union in the Indian

Ocean region should be maintained at the lowest practicable  level. They also agreed that an Indian Ocean arms limitations  agreement must not detract from the ANZUS alliance.

The Council conducted a frank and full exchange of  views on a broad range of other political, economic,Â· and security  issues of concern to the ANZUS partners,  including efforts to  relieve tensions in various parts of the world. The Council  particularly stressed the importance of a successful outcome

to the Strategic Arms Limitations Talks being conducted between  the United States and the Soviet Union. The Ministers emphasised  the need for continuing efforts to prevent nuclear proliferation.  They stressed the desirability of achieving universal adherence

to the Non-Proliferation Treaty,  of which all three countries are  signatories. It was agreed that the early conclusion of a  Comprehensive Test Ban agreement prohibiting nuclear testing  in all environments by all states would also make a significant

contribution to non-proliferation as well as nuclear arms control  objectives. The Ministers accorded high priority to the work  being undertaken in the International Nuclear Fuel Cycle Evaluation.

The Council members also discussed the United Nations Special  Session on Disarmament currently being held in New York. They  underlined the great importance they attached to its deliberations.  They expressed the hope that it would contribute constructively  to an intensified program of arms control activities which could  lead by progressive steps to a reduction in world tensions, a

strengthening of international security, actual disarmament measures  and the release of resources for social and economic progress.

Reviewing developments in the Middle East, the Ministers  commended the historic moves of President Sadat of Egypt and  Prime Minister Begin of Israel in their efforts to bring about  peace.
