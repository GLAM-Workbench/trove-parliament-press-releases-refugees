Guide to Help Migrants Understand Australian Law

A new initiative will help migrants understand Australian law and the role of police, the  Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, Gary Hardgrave, said today.

Mr Hardgrave attended the Northern Territory launch of A Guide to the Role of Police in  Australia, which is designed to help newly arrived migrants understand their rights and  responsibilities under Australian law.

'It is vital that new migrants and refugees are provided with information on Australia's  policing processes and fundamental legal concepts, as they often arrive from countries with  vastly different legal systems and standards,' Mr Hardgrave said.

'This is a practical, informative guide that outlines the criminal justice system in Australia,  provides a list of emergency service contact numbers, and highlights avenues of action for  victims of crime,' he said.

'Many recently arrived migrants may not be reporting crime because of a variety of cultural  reasons.'

A Guide to the Role of Police in Australia was developed by the Australasian Police  Multicultural Advisory Bureau, with funding assistance from the Commonwealth  Government's Living in Harmony initiative.

Produced in English, Arabic, Afghani (Dari), Bosnian, Chinese (Mandarin), Persian (Farsi),  Somali and Vietnamese the guide is now available in PDF form from the Australasian Police  Multicultural Advisory Bureau web site in eight languages at  www.apmab.gov.au/pubs/PoliceGuide.html.

Mr Hardgrave said the guide was an excellent example of the commitment of Australia's  State and Territory police forces to the delivery of culturally appropriate, customer oriented  services to all Australians.

'Strengthening relations between police, and culturally and linguistically diverse communities  is an important step towards ensuring that the needs of multicultural Australia are met, and  that community harmony continues to be achieved,' Mr Hardgrave said.
