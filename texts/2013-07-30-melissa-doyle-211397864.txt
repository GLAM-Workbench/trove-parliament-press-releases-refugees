MELISSA DOYLE:

Tony Abbott, Good morning to you, thanks for your time.

TONY ABBOTT:

‘Morning, Mel.

MELISSA DOYLE:

Why is Nauru a better option than Papua New Guinea?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, we’ve had the same clear policy for more than a decade now, Mel, and if we win the election we want to be able to hit the  ground running. We want to be able to get proper offshore processing up and running very, very quickly. The Labor Party has

been talking about PNG for almost two years and they still don’t have the capacity for more than 300 people even though  something like 1,300 have arrived since Mr. Rudd announced his latest policy backflip. So, we are just consistently, clearly

working on the policies that we have been quite clear about for more than a decade.

MELISSA DOYLE:

And have you fully consulted with all regional leaders on this?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, we don’t need to tell them that we’re doing anything different because it’s not different - it’s the same as we’ve already  done.

MELISSA DOYLE:

We were chatting to Jeff Kennett and Paul Howes a little bit earlier and they used the term “people are not sacks of potatoes to be

used in an election campaign”. Why are we seeing both yourself and the Government trying to out-tough each other? It’s almost  like, who can come up with the strictest, toughest policy on this and we’re talking about people’s lives.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well that’s a fair point, Mel, but you see Kevin Rudd created this problem back in 2008 when he abolished offshore processing at

Nauru and Manus. Kevin Rudd inherited a solution from John Howard; he wasn’t man enough to leave well enough alone. He  abolished the Pacific Solution; almost 50,000 illegal arrivals, 800 boats, $10 billion in budget blowouts and tragically more than

1000 deaths - Kevin Rudd is finally saying ‘uh-huh! I’ve discovered offshore processing’. Well, that’s great but the fact is he  caused this problem and the man who caused the problem will never fix the problem.

MELISSA DOYLE:

You talk about a tent city, look I a couple of years ago went to the Dadaab refugee camp in Africa, where all the Somalians go -

the most depressing place I’ve ever been in my life. Will you put a time limit on this? I mean there are generations who have been

born, 20 years on, people are still living there with no hope for the future, nowhere to go. Do we have a guarantee we won’t see  that on Nauru?

TONY ABBOTT:

Mel, I’ve been to Nauru, and Nauru is quite a pleasant island. Nauru is by no means an unpleasant place to live and over time you

would have better facilities. We would be using tents initially because that’s what you have to do if you’re going to ramp up  accommodation very quickly and we may need a very significant accommodation capacity on Nauru, but over time you would

have the kind of accommodation that was there before and which tragically has recently just been burnt down.

MELISSA DOYLE:

Can I ask you another question? Overnight Pope Francis said gay people should be allowed to integrate into society. He told  reporters that he can’t judge someone who is gay and seeks the Lord with good will. What’s your view, as a Catholic? Do you

think we’re seeing a bit of a change in the Vatican’s position?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well look, I’ll let the Vatican speak for itself here, Mel. I’m not a spokesman for the Catholic Church…

MELISSA DOYLE:

Well, what’s your view?

TONY ABBOTT:

My sister, as you know, Christine is gay. I want her to be treated as every other Australian is treated and that’s the Australian

standard - we don’t discriminate.

MELISSA DOYLE:

And just one final quick question, the election date - when do you think we’ll go to the polls? A lot of speculation about this.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I think Kevin should stop thinking about himself and he should start to think about the Australian people. The people of  Australia are sick of the hung parliament, they’re sick of minority government, they’re sick of the uncertainty. Investment is

stopped, employment is stopped, major purchases are on hold. End the uncertainty, Mr. Rudd. Name the date.

MELISSA DOYLE:

Have you got a suggestion? Have you got a weekend blocked out in your diary?

TONY ABBOTT:

The earliest possible date, I believe, is now the 7th of September, so go for it.

MELISSA DOYLE:

We’ll see what he says. Tony Abbott thanks for your time this morning.
