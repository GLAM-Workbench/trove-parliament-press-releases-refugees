Government must halt child transfers amid  Nauru “medical emergency”

The declaration of a “medical emergency” on Nauru after a fire destroyed a quarter of the hospital,  along with the entirety of the island’s medical supplies, means that all refugees on the island need to  be brought back to Australia immediately, the Australian Greens have said.

“The government must immediately rule out sending children to Nauru and commit to bringing the  refugees who are already there back to Australia,” the Greens’ immigration spokesperson, Senator  Sarah Hanson-Young said.

“The island of Nauru cannot sustain the refugee population that is there currently and cannot be  expected to receive any more people in such dire circumstances.

“If it does not act, the government’s reckless disregard for refugees and their safety will be laid bare  for all to see.

“The Immigration Minister must be upfront with the Australian people. Will the government go  ahead with its plans to send families and children to an island in the midst of a gastroenteritis  outbreak when there are no medical supplies?

“In the past Tony Abbott has hysterically referred to a national emergency in Australia. Now that  there is a genuine national emergency in Nauru, the Labor government must bring all refugees who  are already there back to Australia.

“The Greens are a sole voice in the Australian Parliament, standing up for vulnerable people and  putting forward a genuine regional solution that would save lives at sea while caring for refugees.”
