E&OE………………………………

Topics: Coalition Border Protection & Immigration Policy, talk with the Government, Labor’s  incompetence.

Marcus Bartholomew

The latest asylum seekers to arrive by boat are undergoing health and security checks on Christmas  Island and its arrival yesterday has seen the opposition renew its calls for the Government to adopt  coalition policy by re-introducing temporary protection visas and re-opening the Nauru detention  Centre. Michael Keenan is the opposition’s spokesman on border protection and he has spoken this  morning to Marius Benson.

Marius Benson

Michael Keenan the opposition is calling for a return to the old Coalition plans for Nauru to be re-opened, temporary protection visas - turn the boats around, but the experts in the department - the  people who know most about these issues are saying they won’t work again - they worked once, they  won’t work again.

Michael Keenan

All of the evidence is to the contrary, this is a policy prescription that we know works because we’ve  used it in government and it did work to smash the people smuggling efforts at the time. It’s the only  policy prescription that Australia has ever deployed that has had the effect that we want. Now the  Labor Party has taken every other policy position except for the one that we know works and that’s  why in

2012 it would be the smartest thing for them to do to embrace that policy prescription because it’s the  one that has the history behind it - the one that has actually tackled the problem that we again need to  tackle and that is that people smugglers are now in charge of who comes to Australia.

Marius Benson

But when the department says that the old pacific solution won’t work because the people smugglers  know that 70 per cent of the people ended up where they wanted to end up either in Australia or in a  similar first world location and people are prepared to take those odds on doing it again so it’s no  longer a threat.

Michael Keenan

I just don’t think that that’s right and there is all of the evidence to the contrary. This is the suite of  policies that has been the only thing that has worked in the past - those figures of 70 per cent of  people ending up in Australia and New Zealand are just not correct and that is the sort of propaganda  we get from the government - the point is that…

Marius Benson

They’re the figures from the department.

Michael Keenan

Look the point is Marius that it did actually work and there is no other policy prescription that has been  tried that has had the result that Australia actually needs and unfortunately what we’ve had with this  government is that they’ve had so many different policy positions now and of course none of them  have worked and all of them have encouraged people smuggling by constantly sending out the  message that this government is soft on our borders and that’s why a return to these policies would be  exactly the thing that Australia needs to retain control over our immigration system.

Marius Benson

When you say you are calling for a return to the policies you used in the past - what about people  saying you’ve changed those policies yourself; previously you attached no importance to whether a  destination nation for asylum seekers sent from Australia was a signatory to the Human Rights  Declaration for the United Nations now you say they must be signatories.

Michael Keenan

75 per cent of the world is signatory to that convention and what we are actually saying is that if we  make changes to the Migration Act then we do still need to have some safeguards still in place. The  Howard Government always had those safeguards in the Migration Act and it was the Labor Party’s  response to the High Court decision to strip all of those safeguards out. We are saying that we are  happy to go along with that - with the exception of that one safeguard remaining in place and that is  that a destination country will be a signatory to the UN Convention on refugees. As I said the vast  majority of

the countries of the world are signatory to that convention so that would leave the Labor Party with  plenty of options as to where they would like to go and do off-shore processing.

Marius Benson

One of the countries that is not part of that convention is Indonesia and part of your proposal is to turn  boats around to Indonesia where you believe it is safe.

Michael Keenan

This is two very separate things - turning boats back around is something that we used to send a very  strong message to people smugglers in that if you attempt that journey you won’t necessarily get to  where you wanted to go and obviously as I said that is a very strong message to send to them - that  there business model is not going to work. So they are two very separate things and I reject the  analogy of the both of them being the same.

Marius Benson

Can you respond to the point that some people have made that this is purely cynical politics perhaps  on both sides but looking at your side this is killer issue for Labor if boats keep arriving but it’s  politically (in narrow political terms) very good for you - that’s a driver of opposition policy.

Michael Keenan

It does do them enormous harm but that is not driving our policy, the reason it does them enormous  harm is because it is a policy that they adopted when they came to office that lead Australia down this  blind alley. We said in 2008 that if they were to change the policy that they had inherited that worked to  stop people smuggling that we were going to get exactly the result that we’ve had and that is that they  have provided the kiss of life to people smugglers and we’ve subsequently had thousands of people  arrive in Australia illegally when previously we had none. I think it probably does affect them in the

immigration system again.
