THE 'SOCIAL SECURITY CONSPIRACY' CASE IS OVER

On 7 June 1982 in the Central Court of Petty Sessions in Sydney  the alleged general conspiracy case collapsed when Mr D. Rofe, Q.C.   Senior Counsel for the Government,  announced they would proceed  no further. The commital hearings had been the longest such case

in common law history with over 250 witnesses, more than 1,200  documents and over 32,000 pages of transcript, during 386 sitting  days.

The arrests of 183 people - all but six being pensioners of Greek  origin - had taken placeÂ· on 31 March.  and early April .  1.978. The  charge was laid under the Crimes Act and in substance was that  all had conspired to defraud the"Social Security Department by

issuing (in the case of doctors) and procuring (in the case of  patients) false medical certificates to obtain sickness benefits  and invalid pensions. The account in the following pages comes from my attempt in

Parliament to understand what was happening in Canberra and  Sydney - what were the central issues in the case, what was  the involvement of the bureaucracy, and the effect it had on  the pensioners and beneficiaries.

My knowledge of the events is modest compared with that of the  defence lawyers who have worked with outstanding thoroughness  to unravel the allegations of the Crown.  The presentation of  the defence case had been under way for only three weeks  when the Crown withdrew the major conspiracy charge because

of the Magistrate's assessment of the evidence of the informant,  Chris Nakis and that of former Detective Chief Inspector  Donald Thomas. The Magistrate then brought the commital '   hearings to a close.

It was rightly a triumph.for those lawyers and, belatedly, for  the legal system. Though I am critical in many respects of  actions or inactions of Government Ministers in these events  I am conscious of the fairness of Senator Durack, as Attorney-  General, in meeting the requests of the Australian Legal Aid  Office for the facilities they needed to assemble and present

the arguments for the defence.

Early history

As far as the public is concerned, the story begain in a blaze  of publicity when the arrests were made in Sydney in 1978. With banner headlines of "Police Seek 1400 More Pay Cheats",  "Greece Hunt for $42m. .  Pension Cheats" and "$42m. Medical

'Racket'", few people would doubt that a massive fraud had .   been uncovered and that the Commonwealth Police was in control  of all relevant evidence. (Unfortunately the Crown's climb-down  was given far less publicity.) .

The involvement of my office began when Greek welfare workers,  besieged by distraught pensioners whose only income, invalid  pensions or sickness benefits, had been stopped, sought my  help in restoring those social services.

* More detail will be available when a book is written and a  film made of the affair. They will not be written in this  office, which will now return to normal.

I then became aware of the chaotic situation, the fear and the  bewilderment. Not only the 176 arrested pensioners lost their  pensions and benefits, but the Department of Social Security  on 31 March 1978 cancelled the pensions of another 410 Greek-  born pensioners who had not been, and never have been, charged.

Complaints included the treatment at police headquarters, a lack  of search warrants, confiscation of bankbooks, passports, medical  reports and letters. There had been pandemonium in police  stations and later in the courts, and allegations of telephone  tapping and more arrests to come. Superintendent Bob Gillespie

said that Commonwealth Police had been placed at all major  Australian airports to stop people connected with the fraud  from leaving the country.

However, even well-founded complaints were denied by Senator  Guilfoyle who received most of her advice from the Commonwealth  Police and from her Director-General, Mr Lanigan. She did not  pass the test set by her colleague, Mr McPhee, who said on

20 November 1979: .  ;

"Good Ministers cross-examine the advice they receive,  weigh it carefully and often check it against reliable,  confidential advice from other quarters."

Though Senator Guilfoyle tried to distance herself from the  arrests, the Department of Social Security was heavily  involved from the earliest days. It participated in  discussions of a possible reward for the chief informant,

set the time-table for the raids, and simultaneously stopped  pensions. Detective Chief Inspector Thomas and Lanigan were  together in the operations room of Police Headquarters on the night  of 2 April 1978 and at court together the following day..

Outline of the alleged conspiracy

The Crown's star witness was Chris Nakis who decided to give  evidence about the 1  conspiracy1  following the cancellation  of his invalid pension on 24 June 1977, the day before he was  to travel to Greece.

Nakis approached Detective Chief Inspector Thomas, giving at  first the name Con Polous and requesting (a) immunity; and  (b) a reward commensurate with savings to the Commonwealth V and his value as an informant. ,

Meetings were held between officers of the Commonwealth Police  and the Department of Social Security, with officers from  Attorney-General's, Deputy Crown Solicitor's and the Department  of Health attending at some time, to discuss the reward and

the information to be supplied.

At the major meeting on 15 September 1977, in the office of  Mr Lanigan, it was agreed that a Ministerial (generally a  communication to or from a Minister) would be sent from the  Commonwealth Police to Mr Lanigan who would forward it to

Senator Guilfoyle. This would set out the 'scale' to justify  the payment of a $30,000 reward. Whether Mr Lanigan did talk  to Senator Guilfoyle about the reward remains a matter of  dispute between them.

3 .

' <1 ,

When Nakis raised his reward demand to $200,000, Mr Lanigan  withdrew the Department of Social Security from subsequent  negotiations.

Nakis, who now considered he had a significant financial incentive,  and Thomas put together the case on which Mr Rofe, Q.C., relied  heavily when he opened for the Crown on 26 March 1979 in the  commital hearings on the first batch of 21 defendants, just one

year after the arrests.

Mr. Rofe stated that up to some 1,400 persons, whom he later called  co-conspirators, were possibly involved. He said:

"The alleged purpose of the general conspiracy was to  obtain fraudulently from the Department of Social Security  sickness benefits and invalid pensions.  The Crown alleges  that the obtaining was fraudulent in that the claimants were .   not entitled to the payment of such benefits or pensions at  all or alternatively that the obtaining of benefits and  pensions was achieved upon the basis of the existence of a

stated medical condition from which, in fact, the claimants  did not suffer."

The alleged conspiracy also included payment to agents,iand  Medibank fraud by the accused doctors.

Time eroded some of the Government's enthusiasm. Between  May 1978 and 30 October 1980 the Crown dropped the conspiracy  charge against all defendants not involved in the commital  hearings. The reason it gave for dropping the charges of the

largest group in October 1980 was 1  administrative realities'.

Disintegration of the alleged conspiracy

The Crown's chief witness, Nakis, proved to be a liability. From the time the facts regarding his proposed reward were  revealed, together with his assembly of lies and prevarications  under cross-examination in 1979, his credibility was shot. However, the Crown case continued on for another two and a half years.  In the early stage of his defence address in May 1982 Mr Einfeld, Q.C., said:

"Nakis is one of the most extraordinary liars, extraordinarily  brazen, extraordinarily mercenary, extraordinarily premeditated,  extraordinarily thorough, extraordinarily cunning liars to  have come before a court." .

The Magistrate, Mr Bruce Brown, said:

".. he is a person who tells lies on oath. .  a witness  whose credit is zero or next to zero." and

".. Nakis'  evidence is tainted as I've indicated. I propose to hold that way. and that will itself flow  to Detective Chief Inspector Thomas."

When the Magistrate^ stated that it would be unsafe to place  any credence or reliance on the testimony of Thomas as well as  that of Nakis, Mr Rofe threw in the towelÂ· "the Crown no longer pursues its allegation of a general

conspiracy."

4 .

I quote two findings of importance on that last day, 7 June,  by Mr Brown, who had sat on the Bench through the entire  proceedings. .

The first states that evidence had established the 'highest  impropriety' by the then Detective Chief Inspector Thomas. He said: .

".. I propose to bring the circumstances of these actions  by Detective Chief Inspector Thomas as he then was to the  .notice of the relevant Attorney-General with a view to  proceedings being taken against former Detective Chief

Inspector Thomas for conspiracy to pervert the course of  justice or for perjury or for both."

The second was a positive and unequivocal statement regarding  the innocence of the defendants.

".. the defendants walk out of Court just as they walked into  it, innocent until proven guilty... It doesn't matter just  how many charges or the degree or nature of the charges which  are brought unless or until the guilt of that person is proven  beyond reasonable doubt that he is innocent. He's innocent in

the law, he's innocent in society. He should be innocent in  his neighbourhood and he should be innocent in his home. Now I can't put it any higher than that."

Further comment

. The need for a full-scale inquiry remains. The Government  has never made a major statement on the case. We have had  misleading information given by Ministers to Parliament, and  conflicting versions of events from Head of the same department. The course of decision-making  and action taken in the Department of Social Security, the  Attorney-General's Department and the Commonwealth Police  should come under the closest scrutiny so that such a massive  injustice will not occur again. .  We need a comprehensive and honest statement by the Government  of the costs involved in this ill-judged and empty exercise. Mr Rofe told of a $42 million fraud. What does the Government  think now? He said the court costs alone (at 1979 prices)  would be $20,000 a day. If they are correct, and Senator  Durack has refused to confirm the figure, that would be about  $8 million, plus vast costs in computers and other facilities. .  It is important to note that the Department of Social Security  made no attempt to recover any money from the people allegedly  defrauding the Department. In the majority of cases those  people continued to get invalid pensions or sickness benefits  for the same reason they had originally been granted them -  because they were entitled. . If it were in any way necessary for non English speaking migrants  to pay money to agents to help them complete application forms  of the Department of Social Security and master the procedures,  then the Department is failing in its job and'should improve  its service to migrant and less educated groups. 5 . .  The Government presented a case based on the proposition  that false medical certificates had been issued by the  accused doctors to patients not suffering from the stated  medical conditions. Yet, at no time in those three years  did the Government produce any contrary medical evidence  to suggest that any single patient did not suffer from  the conditions on the certificates.  In fact, all the  medical evidence they did present from the Australian  Government medical officers confirmed that accuracy of  the medical reports on which social services had been granted. .  It was remarked during the case that when you put into a  computer that you want Greek born invalid pensioners, that  is what the computer will give you. No control pattern of  pensioners from other countries appears to have been sought,  yet there are thousands of cases of migrants from, for example, Italy, Turkey and Yugoslavia, not to mention Australian-  born pensioners, with similar physical and mental disorders. .  Over 100 pensions in Greece were cancelled in 1978 at the same  time as the arrests, chosen by the computer in the same  manner. It pointed out the ease with which a Government can  suddenly, even capriciously, withdraw pensions from people  who have spent their working lives in Australia and had  been entitled to those pensions. .  The procedures of the Department of Social Security allow  pensioners and beneficiaries an interview if misinformation  is suspected. Warning can then be given that they face  repayments and possible prosecution if that false information  has been proved. Such procedures, violate no rights or dignity. .  The Government should reconsider its refusal to admit liability  in the cases of persons charged in 1978. It is inadvisable i   for the Government to put itself, and unfair to put pensioners, .  through further long and costly hearings to obtain damages  in respect of malicious prosecution and false arrest. I conclude with a question from the opening address of Mr. Einfeld Q.G.: "Has it all been worth it, the millions of dollars,  the computers,  the defamations, the court's time and  hopelessly overstrained facilities, the wear and  tear on the capacity of the system to handle it,  the divisions in society and in the Greek community  and most of all the utterly heartless and relentless  persecution of poor battling families, men, women and  tiny children and their elderly relatives?"

A NEW MEDICAL TEAM FOR GREECE The remaining invalid pensioners in Greece will benefit from the  conclusion of the conspiracy case. There are between 55 and 60  ex-pensioners whose pensions were stopped at the time of the  1978 arrests. Because they had spent their working lives in Australia  and not contributed to a Greek pension scheme, they were not entitled  to Greek pensions'!! Most have been forced to live on charity. Senator Chaney has at last responded to many Opposition requests  to reassess their medical histories and present condition and in a  letter to me on 25 June 1982 said: ".. Arrangements are being made to send a medical team to  Greece to examine these people concerned under the new guidelines  which were introduced last year. I have no reason to believe  that the two previous medical reviews were not conducted with  scrupulous fairness and propriety but.I agree that we should  leave no stone unturned to ensure that justice is both done and  seen to be done. It is expected that the consultant medical.   team will consist of a physician, a senior Department of Health  officer, a psychiatrist and an orthopaedic surgeion. This  range of specialties should cover the disabilities originally  claimed by the remaining people. My department will actively seek to contact all those concerned,  but we should not under-estimate the difficulties involved." I have already welcomed this action. I now wish to suggest  that the medical team, before they leave, should read decisions  given by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in relation to  invalid pension appeals. It is necessary for the understanding  of the likely success the pensioners in Greece would have if they  too had recourse to the A.A.T. It is also instructive to recognise  the role of the patient advocates and lawyers in restoring invalid  pensions where they have been stopped on departmental instructions. As no lawyer or social worker is flying to Greece with the medical  team, I hope that one or all of the team will consider adopting  the role of advocate as well as medical judge. ROUGH INJUSTICE FROM SOCIAL SECURITY All Members of Parliament and community workers come across cases  where the Department of Social Security has made decisions seemingly  both unjust and incomprehensible. Two have recently come to me. .  The marriage of this woman was annulled after 25 years. On  advice from the Department she gave up her job and applied for  widow's pension, and was then refused it because it was an  annulment, not a divorce. Her appeal was upheld by the Social  Security Appeals Tribunal but vetoed by the Director-General. .  The Department has refused to grant double orphans' pension to  a grandmother for the four children of her son killed in a car  accident.  She does not know where the children's mother is and  .  has not seen her, nor have the children, since their father's death  Social Security claims the whereabouts of the mother was sometimes  known to the police so therefore the grandmother could find her. The grandmother lives in a very small country town 200 miles from  Perth, cannot read or write and has local debts of about $2,000.  Even if she could get to a phone she would have to locate the  right police station on the right day. Even then it is .  . questionable whether the mother's address should be given without  her authority.
