ABC News 24 ‘Capital Hill’  Transcript, E&OE

22 June 2011

LYNDAL CURTIS: Welcome to Capital Hill. Well, the Opposition's proposal for a  plebiscite died in the Senate this morning as Family First Senator Steve Fielding sided with  the government to knock off an Opposition attempt to bring debate about the plebiscite on.  Senator Fielding has disappointed the Opposition again this afternoon, siding with the  government to block an attempt by the Coalition and Independent Nick Xenophon to overturn  the ban on exit fees. In the House of Representatives the tone was a little milder than it was  overnight, as repeated quorums upset the Speaker. Today, however, there was a full Question  Time, the first time for awhile. To discuss the issues of the day, I've been joined by Liberal  MP Russell Broadbent, and Labor Parliamentary Secretary Richard Marles. Welcome to you  both.

RICHARD MARLES: Good afternoon Lyndal.

LYNDAL CURTIS: Russell Broadbent, was there any surprise this morning that Steve  Fielding decided to side with the government to knock off your idea for a plebiscite?

RUSSELL BROADBENT: I don't think it was a great surprise. As the Australian people are  well aware, we are captive of the Senate. We have to recognise that. Both parties recognise  that. They realise what is going to go on in the Senate is going to control what goes on the

parliament.

LYNDAL CURTIS: And, Richard, Steve Fielding has voted with the Opposition a number  of times in his time in parliament. A little surprised to make him your friend at the end?

RICHARD MARLES: Well, I think Steve Fielding saw through what was an obvious stunt.  He got to the nub of the point which was that Tony Abbott made it clear that he wasn't going  to accept the result of his own plebiscite, which said right upfront that it was a stunt. You

would have thought you would have workshopped that question a little better in your own  mind before you put forward the idea of a plebiscite, about whether you would actually

accept the result. It would have been an enormously costly exercise without any measurable  result for the Australian people, and Stephen Fielding saw that.

LYNDAL CURTIS: Russell, is it worthwhile continuing to pursue it in the House of  Representatives where the numbers are not so clear?

RUSSELL BROADBENT: Well, continuing to pursue it if you know that you are defeated  from the beginning and you're not going to get it through the Senate, I don't think there's a  case for continuing on belting your head against a brick wall. You know, you've made the  point. You'd love to give the Australian people the opportunity to have their say through a  plebiscite. You've made that point. There's been calls for an election campaign. I don't know

what the next call will be for the Australian people to have their say about the tax. But I think  that one's finished.

LYNDAL CURTIS: Richard, it would have been difficult for you, though, wouldn't it, if the  numbers had gone with the Opposition Leader to get the plebiscite up, because on all the  polling we've seen you would have lost wouldn't you?

RICHARD MARLES: Well this is a difficult debate, and one that we are prosecuting  through with the Australian people. It is a debate which is going to take time to explain to the  Australian people. And we're very prepared to do that, in a very sober way, to explain why  we need to walk down this path. But at the end of the day it is really clear that as a country,  we need to grasp this nettle. We cannot afford to be left behind on the issue of climate  change. We have one of the most carbon-dependent economies in the developed world. And  if we don't move and change, and if we don't put the right indicators within our economy,  then we're at a real risk of losing our industry in the future, because we will be left behind in  a world where production based on high-carbon intensity is seen as a real disadvantage.

LYNDAL CURTIS: There's been a lot of heat in the debate — and the pun is intentional —  about carbon. There was less heat in the Parliament today — we even saw some of the  independents back Bob Katter up by wearing shiny hats as he asked a question. The  Parliament last night though was much more of a tactical battle with quorum calls. Russell  Broadbent, does it do either side of Parliament any good to be continually disruptive. Do the  public like that? Do they not appreciate it?

RUSSELL BROADBENT: I don't think the public actually worry about it. I think Bob  Katter made a point today about football. I mean he knows — he's the one person that  actually knows what people are concerned about in a given area. And I suppose for Richard  and myself, I think there's an underlying tension in the Parliament, because I don't know how

you're affected, Richard, in Geelong, but I know that down in Gippsland we are affected by  the tax. There's great concern in the community about this tax is going to do us over again —  we've been done over once before with the restructure of the power industry. We're going to  be done over again with this tax and these city-based Canberra-based politicians.

LYNDAL CURTIS: So is that tension manifesting itself in the tactical battles?

RUSSELL BROADBENT: [Indistinct] because I believe that… I know that there are  members on both sides of the house that are actually affected by the carbon-tax issue, and  they will need to address it. Now I'm not going to name who they are on your side, but I  know on our side people like Darren Chester are particularly keen to get answers from the

government. We've had a good spread of government ministers down there, as well as Ross  Garnaut. But still the underlying concern of the Australian people — you said yourself that if  that plebiscite happens, Mr Abbott's plebiscite got up, it would lose. He did make the point  that if this plebis… if the Australian people got the opportunity, they'd vote against it.

RICHARD MARLES: Well, Russell and I share this -that both our electorates have a  foundation in some respects in relation to CO2 emissions. We're both carbon-dependent  electorates. There's a lot of electricity generated out of Russell's area which is then consumed  in my electorate in Geelong. But the point is simply this -the rest of the world is moving. And  if we pretend that we can talk about city-based politics and that somehow we can put a fence  around Geelong, or a fence around Gippsland, and that we'll all be secure behind that fence,  we're completely kidding ourselves. If the rest of the world moves to an economic base which  sees carbon intensity as a real economic disadvantage, that's going to put Russell's area —  and my area — out of business, which is why we have to change. And that's why as a  government we are leading the process of that change — and leading the debate in  communities like Russell's, and in communities like mine in Geelong about why it's so  important we move down this path so that we do have future industries in places like  Morwell, and the Latrobe Valley, and in Geelong.

LYNDAL CURTIS: But there was some tactical shenanigans in question time today. Julie  Bishop, the Shadow Foreign Minister, the Deputy Opposition Leader asked the Foreign  Minister, Kevin Rudd, a question. She sought to pick up on discussion that the Foreign  Minister is not engaged on some of the difficult issues that face the government, including the  question of asylum seekers. Richard Marles, you've been one of those looking at the issue  because you're a Parliamentary Secretary for the Pacific. Is the Foreign Affairs Minister  engaged in these questions, helping out?

RICHARD MARLES: The Foreign Minister is absolutely engaged in these questions. The  Foreign Minister is definitely helping out on these issues. And the Foreign Minister is central  to the relationship that we have with our nearest-most neighbours. I've spent quite a bit of  time now in Papua New Guinea in this role, and the standing of Kevin Rudd in Papua New  Guinea is absolutely fantastic, not the least because it was the first place he visited in a  bilateral sense as the Prime Minister of Australia, and that was something that was very much  noted — and continually noted by Papua New Guinea today.

LYNDAL CURTIS: Is it only the uncertainty as he pointed out in Papua New Guinean  politics that has stopped the discussion about opening a processing centre on Manus Island  progressing?

RICHARD MARLES: Politics in PNG has been difficult, and that's for a very obvious  reason, which is that the Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea has been sick, and is currently  in Singapore. And I think we've got to give PNG a bit of space in relation to that, and  acknowledge the circumstances that they're in. That would be a difficult situation for any  country. And so that's what's going on in PNG, but discussions are still continuing in relation  to a processing centre there. And we'll see how that ultimately transpires. But Kevin Rudd  has been very engaged in this process. He met with the Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea  in Singapore around this issue. And so, you know, he could not be more involved.

RUSSELL BROADBENT: The problem with seeing the Foreign Minister enjoy… with all  due respect Richard — not a bad line, actually, I think he put it over very well. But the fact is

watching Parliament today you could see the tension that is there and the Foreign Minister  enjoying the discomfort of the government. I have never seen anything like that in my years,  back to 19… I have never seen anything like the Foreign Minister enjoying the discomfort of  the government on all these issues.

LYNDAL CURTIS: Well Russell, the government was critical of the Immigration  Spokesperson for your side, Scott Morrison, who's planning a…

RUSSELL BROADBENT: But the government's always critical of Scott Morrison.

LYNDAL CURTIS: He's planning a visit to Malaysia. Can Mr Morrison go to Malaysia and  be critical of Australia, of the government's attempt to set up the asylum-seeker swap.

RUSSELL BROADBENT: Well I've read his intention to go to Malaysia. I didn't read his  intention to criticise either our government, when he's overseas, or the Malaysian government  when he's overseas — rather be a fact-finding missions, discussions that he had, as Shadow  Ministers should go and do. He may come back with a different view, Lyndal.

LYNDAL CURTIS: Do you expect he will?

RUSSELL BROADBENT: Well I'm — I'd make sure that I keep strong open lines with all  my colleagues on both sides of the house on behalf of my constituency — that's one of my  roles and responsibilities. I have an open channel with Scott Morrison. Anytime he wants to  talk about these issues, we talk. We may not always agree. But we talk.

LYNDAL CURTIS: Is either of the solutions that are up being debated — the question of  the Malaysian asylum seeker swap, or the Coalition's solution of a detention centre on Nauru  acceptable?

RUSSELL BROADBENT: Can I go to where the Australian people are at? And they look at  it and they say — there's 94,000 people in Malaysia that are displaced people. Can I call them  displaced people rather than whatever they may be, refugees…. 94,000. And we're going to

send them another 800 which with all due respect to Chris Bowen's assurances, we actually  don't know how they'll be cared for and treated after we give them a ticket to go up there.  And two of those people are actually connected to — and the wife and the little boy will have  their husband here who's been recognised as a refugee. That — the community out there,  what they're telling me is they find this unacceptable.

RICHARD MARLES: Well — hang on… I absolutely a…

RUSSELL BROADBENT: It is, it's unacceptable.

RICHARD MARLES: The one thing I agree with Russell is…

RUSSELL BROADBENT: 94,000 and 800 people.

RICHARD MARLES: Russell has a very open mind and he absolutely does keep lines of  communication going, but you can't say that in relation to Scott Morrison. Scott Morrison has  absolutely made clear that his view is not going to change one iota by going to Malaysia, so  there's no sense in which this is a fact finding mission. This is a stunt. But it's worse than that.

This is a member of the Opposition going overseas and running interference on Australia's  bilateral relationships. Now that's actually unprecedented in Australian politics. And it goes  against the behaviour of oppositions and governments really since federation.

LYNDAL CURTIS: But is… but he may not, there's no, we don't know yet what he's going  to say though, as Russell pointed out. He may just go over have a look and then come back to  make — come back to Australia to make his points.

RICHARD MARLES: He's not going over there on a fact-finding mission. He's not going  over there to work out what's happening so that the Coalition can book a policy in relation to  this. I think we should be deeply sceptical about what Scott Morrison's doing. But if he goes  [indistinct] and runs interference on our bilateral relationship, and it causes offence to both  Australia but more significantly to Malaysia whilst he is there, that is an appalling act for  which he ought to be condemned.

RUSSELL BROADBENT: But he will see displaced people in cages. He will see children  in cages.

RICHARD MARLES: But what Russell hasn't mentioned in terms of the Malaysian  solution is that we will receive another 4000 people from Malaysia through an ordered  process as part of our refugee intake. Now I think given Russell's history that would be  something which he would commend. And that's why this is a balanced proposal, which does  deliver a good result in terms of a compassionate Australia working through an ordered  process, but one which also breaks the model of people smuggling so that we have secure  borders.

LYNDAL CURTIS: If I — sorry, Russell.

RUSSELL BROADBENT: Your own backbench though have said unless this passes the  UNHCR tests, they're not going to…

RICHARD MARLES: The UNHCR are right in there. The UNHCR are right in there in  terms of the negotiations.

RUSSELL BROADBENT: I have never heard, ever heard that come out of a Labor caucus  meeting — that a group in the Labor caucus have said to the Prime Minister unless this is  ticked off by the UNHCR, we're not going to tick off and you're not going to be allowed to do  it.
