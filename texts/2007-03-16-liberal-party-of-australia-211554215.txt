Port Hedland lease to ease housing shortage

Friday, 16 March 2007

The mothballed Port Hedland Immigration Detention Centre is to be leased as  temporary accommodation in a bid to help ease the acute housing shortage in  north-west Western Australia.

The centre, which was built to house up to 720 people, was mothballed in  mid-2004.

It has been in contingency mode since.

It is because of the strong deterrent effect of the Australian Governmentâ€™s  border security policies on unauthorised boat arrivals that it is now in a  position to consider leasing the facility.

The centre will be offered for lease through an expression of interest process,  which will be advertised on March 24.

Any enquiries about the leasing process for the Port Hedland facility should be  directed to David Doherty of the Department of Immigration and Citizenship  on (02) 6264 2257.
