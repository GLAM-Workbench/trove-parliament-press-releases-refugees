E&OE……………………….…………………………………………………………………

DAVID SPEERS:

What did you take from tonight’s budget?

JOE HOCKEY:

Well, I think it’s a shameless con. I think the government’s assumption that we are going to have the  best terms of trade in 60 years, despite the fact they’re introducing a massive new mining tax, means  that the numbers are unbelievable. Their claim of a budget surplus in three years time, a $1 billion  surplus in three years time, effectively means they will never deliver a budget surplus. Kevin Rudd  and Wayne Swan will never deliver a budget surplus.

DAVID SPEERS:

But hang on, $1 billion might be only $1 billion, why are you saying they won’t deliver that?

JOE HOCKEY:

Because it’s based on a $9 billion a year resources tax.

DAVID SPEERS:

But they are saying its not, but even without that mining tax revenue of $12 billion, they’ll still get  into surplus in three years?

JOE HOCKEY:

Well, effectively it is because you see the variations in the budget are so significant. The parameters  have changed so dramatically that it is inconceivable that they are going to not have a single major  spending initiative between now and 2014. That’s what they are saying. Kevin Rudd has said ‘trust  me’.  Well, after the ETS, pink bats, school halls, the double drop off on child care, everything else he  promised, no more trust.

DAVID SPEERS:

Business is divided on this as we know but certainly the super bodies, these industry bodies, they want  bipartisan support. They want the company tax rate cut, they want the increase in the superannuation  guarantee, so are you prepared to sacrifice those things to oppose the resource super tax?

JOE HOCKEY:

Well, of course the super industry is going to want an increase in superannuation contributions. That’s  perfectly logical, that’s their bread and butter. It increases the pool of funding by $24 billion a year.

DAVID SPEERS:

But you’re happy to sacrifice that?

JOE HOCKEY:

That $24 billion has to either come from employees take home salaries, which means they’ve got left  money or it has to come from employers. None of its coming from Kevin Rudd, none of its coming  from the Budget. They’ve got a few other measures, today when for example, well let’s talk about tax  cuts.

Shamelessly, Wayne Swan was claiming credit for the tax cuts to be delivered on the 1st of July. They  were actually our tax cuts, we announced them, we funded them, we left this government with a  massive surplus, we left this government with 4 per cent unemployment. Tonight they said for  example, that full employment is 4.75 per cent.

DAVID SPEERS:

Well let’s look at the new things they did announce tonight. You obviously oppose the mining tax?

JOE HOCKEY:

Yes.

DAVID SPEERS:

What about some of these other areas they’ve announced, simplified tax returns?

JOE HOCKEY:

It’s perfectly logical to have simplified tax returns.

DAVID SPEERS:

What about the savings bonus? Put money into a bank account, you’ll have halve your tax…

JOE HOCKEY:

You know how much that works out at? $3 a week. Amanda Vanstone once described a tax cut as a  sandwich and a milkshake. This is just the milkshake. $3 a week, the big savings initiative in this  Budget is going to deliver someone on lower income who has $20,000 in the bank, $3 a week.

DAVID SPEERS:

Yeah, but you wont oppose it?

JOE HOCKEY:

Well, we will see on all of these things.

DAVID SPEERS:

What’s wrong with it?

JOE HOCKEY:

Because you know if your going to spend money it’s got to be effective and the best thing you can do  to improve savings is to have a real budget surplus. David look, the reason why the government is  going to have to borrow $711 million a week from now until the day they actually deliver a surplus.  That is money that is not available for small business, money not available for home borrowers and it  is going to crowd out the credit field at a crucial moment. The best thing you can do for national  savings is to have the government come back to surplus and I guarantee Kevin Rudd and Wayne  Swan will never deliver a surplus.

DAVID SPEERS:

But how would you get the Budget back into surplus without that mining tax, without the private  health insurance means test that you’re opposed to as well? Where does your fiscal credibility stack  up if you’re not willing to support these savings measures?

JOE HOCKEY:

Well, we’ve had, what, six hours to see the Budget numbers? We will outline…

DAVID SPEERS:

[inaudible]

JOE HOCKEY:

And we’ve made it clear what our position on the mining tax is. We will outline in full detail our  savings initiatives and our spending initiatives before the election.

DAVID SPEERS:

On Thursday night in the Budget Reply?

JOE HOCKEY:

Well, there may well be some of it on Thursday night.

DAVID SPEERS:

But we can’t expect an alternative Budget?

JOE HOCKEY:

Oh, no, how can you deliver… these guys have been spending, what, six months preparing this  Budget and you’re asking us to deliver a detailed, comparable alternative in two days?

DAVID SPEERS:

If you’re so concerned about this Government not being able to return us to surplus but you’re not  supporting the ways it’s going to get there...

JOE HOCKEY:

Well, they’re only getting closer to surplus on the basis of changes in the parameters of the Budget -  that you’ve got higher growth, you’ve got lower unemployment. They got the numbers desperately  wrong last year and now they’re trying to claim credit for it.

DAVID SPEERS:

Well, you did too, I mean, you said this time last year, I’ll just find the quote here, because you were  talking about the growth assumptions being recklessly irresponsible, being over the top, but the  assumptions in the Budget were too strong. That’s what you said last year.

JOE HOCKEY:

Well, that’s right, because they were saying, and we were taking their advice, as you were, that this  was the end of the world. Well, it wasn’t the end of the world. The world didn’t come to a…

DAVID SPEERS:

You said their assumptions last year were over the top.

JOE HOCKEY:

Yeah, and that is because they were saying at the time that it was the end of the world and therefore if  you believed their rhetoric that it was the end of the world then their assumptions were heroic. As it  turned out, the assumptions in the Budget were completely wrong and what they got terribly wrong  was that there was no banking failure in Australia, thank goodness. China had a massive stimulus…

DAVID SPEERS:

But the banking failure, it came out partly because of the bank guarantee?

JOE HOCKEY:

Well, mate, can I promise you, it came about because we had well-capitalised, well prudentially  supervised financial institutions, it was initiated under the Wallis reforms under us and the financial  services reforms that I introduced as Financial Services Minister, so there’s a bit of history there.

BRIDIE BARRY:

Stimulus spending as well, to help that turnaround…

JOE HOCKEY:

Well, you know the interesting thing… then you can ask Wayne Swan when he’s on, why is he still  spending $500 million on new school halls in 2012 because it was a negative quarter of economic  growth… There’s just three other things you need to know…

DAVID SPEERS:

He points to global uncertainty, Greece, Europe…

JOE HOCKEY:

Of course, yes. There’s three things you need to know. Firstly, they are spending nearly $1 billion  dealing with the asylum seeker issue, which is a reflection on their poor border protection policies.  Secondly, they are spending nearly $1 billion trying to fix their pink batt programme. And thirdly, the  Government claimed there was not going to be any new public servants dealing with the national  hospital plan, they’ve allocated half a billion dollars for new public servants.

DAVID SPEERS:

Alright. On that point, Joe Hockey, thank you for joining us.

JOE HOCKEY:

Thanks very much.
