Put safety first in family law, abandon flawed family court merger

The safety of children and adult survivors of family violence should not be put at risk by the abolition of a  stand-alone specialist family court.

In an Open Letter a diverse group of organisations are calling on the Attorney-General to abandon the  Government’s proposed family court merger and instead strengthen specialisation in family law and family  violence.

“Any reform should strengthen a system, not lead to the diminution of specialisation. If the Government’s  proposed reforms proceed, we will lose a stand-alone specialist superior family court,” says Mr Nassim Arrage,  CEO of Community Legal Centres Australia.

“Government commissioned inquiry after inquiry has recommended increasing specialisation in both family  law and family violence, including the recent Australian Law Reform Commission Review of the Family Law  System.  The safety of children and adult victims-survivors of family violence in the family law system must be a  Government priority and must come first,” says Ms Angela Lynch AM, Women’s Legal Services Australia  spokesperson.

“The proposed merger would further compound current issues with the family law system, leading to poorer  outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children and their families. Based on the experience of  Aboriginal Legal Services across the country, these reforms will lead to a range of unintended consequences  including a reduced number of specialist family law judges, poorer decisions and increased costs for litigants.  Most unfortunately, these reforms will disproportionately impact the most vulnerable including Aboriginal and  Torres Strait Islander children and families who need the most support,” says Ms Nerita Waight, Co-Chair,  National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Legal Services.

“We question the emphasis on achieving efficiencies in what is already a chronically under-funded system.  Instead, the emphasis should be on the reforms that can best deliver safety for children and adult  victims/survivors of family violence,” says Dr Merrindahl Andrew, Australian Women Against Violence Alliance  Program Manager.

“The proposed merger fails to alleviate the fundamental problems plaguing the system, including the risk of  victims of family violence falling through the cracks. We urge the Government to retain and properly resource  a specialist, stand alone family court.  Greater resourcing, funding and investment in the system is critical and  would make a tangible difference to the quality of justice clients experience,” says Law Council President,  Arthur Moses SC.

Signatories to the Open Letter include sexual, domestic and family violence service providers and peaks,  specialist family law and child protection legal assistance providers, academics and legal practitioners.  Signatories are also calling on the Government to consult on alternative models of structural, holistic reform to  benefit children, families and victims-survivors of family violence.

Open Letter

Concerns about proposed family court merger

11 November 2019

Dear Attorney-General,

We, the undersigned, are writing to you about the Government’s proposal to merge the Family  Court of Australia and the Federal Circuit Court of Australia into a single generalised court: the  Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia.

Any reform should strengthen a system, not lead to the diminution of specialisation. If the  Government’s proposed reforms proceed, we will lose a stand-alone specialist superior family  court.

In acknowledging the need to prioritise the safety of children and adult victims-survivors of family  violence in the family law system, government commissioned inquiry after inquiry has  recommended increasing specialisation in both family law and family violence, including the recent  Australian Law Reform Commission inquiry into the family law system.1  We believe this should  be a Government priority.

We understand and support having a single entry point to the family courts and common rules so  the family law system is easier for families to navigate. We understand this is a key reason why the  Government is seeking to reform the family courts.

However, there are different ways this can be achieved. And this can be done without abandoning  the benefits otherwise available to children and families from a properly resourced and specialised  court system.

The Family Court of Australia has said “common rules, forms and complementary case  management systems” … “can be achieved without legislative amendment”.2  The Federal Circuit  Court of Australia has acknowledged the importance of a single point of entry and common case  management system “whether or not the enabling legislative framework is in place”.3

Similarly, there are different models for reforming the family courts other than the model proposed  by the Government.

The New South Wales Bar Association has proposed keeping the stand-alone specialist superior  family court.4 Family Court Judges would be in Division 1 of the Family Court of Australia.  Federal Circuit Court judges who are hearing family law matters would move across to Division 2  of the Family Court of Australia.  In this way, federal judges hearing only family law matters would  be in a single specialist family court offering judicial, social science and other services.

We believe an increase in specialisation in family law and family violence will increase the safety  of children and adult victims-survivors of family violence.  This is particularly the case for groups  that are disproportionately impacted in the family law and family violence systems, including  Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.  The need for increased specialisation of courts to  improve decisions and outcomes for families is supported by the evidence of many inquiries.

We advocate for further discussion of the different options.

We prefer a model that retains a stand-alone specialist superior family court and increases family  law and family violence specialisation, such as the proposal by the New South Wales Bar  Association. The safety of children and adult victims-survivors of family violence requires  increased specialisation.  The proposed merger serves only to undermine that important need.

While we support just, quick and cheap access to justice and there is a role for increasing  efficiencies within our court systems, this must not come at the cost of the safety of children and  adult victims-survivors of family violence.  These two important imperatives are not mutually  exclusive, and one ought not be abandoned at the expense of the other.

Safety must come first in family law.

We would welcome further consultations on alternative models of structural, holistic reform to  benefit children, families and victims-survivors of family violence.

Action can also be taken now to further increase family violence specialisation in the family law  system through:  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Introducing effective ongoing court-based family violence risk assessment practices  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Early determination of family violence, and

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Increasing family violence competency of all professionals in the family law system
