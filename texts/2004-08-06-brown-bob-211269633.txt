High court rulings show detention  regime is wrong

Two High Court rulings today provided more evidence of why  Australia's immigration detention regime is inhumane and should be  overhauled, Greens Senator Bob Brown said.

"The court, in a majority ruling, upheld the lawfulness of indefinite  immigration detention for asylum seekers who cannot find a country to  provide refuge," Senator Brown said.



"In a second case, the majority of judges said that harsh conditions of  detention were no defence to a charge of escaping from immigration  detention."

The first case involved two detainees, from Palestine and Iraq, whose  asylum claims were rejected and who wanted to leave Australia but  who could not find a country to take them. The court said it was lawful  to keep them in detention until they could be deported.

The second case involved an Iranian man who escaped from Woomera  detention centre and sought to argue that inhumane conditions of  detention were a defence but the court rejected this.

In a dissenting judgement, Justice Michael Kirby said it was not  unrealistic to assume that the man had no effective remedies to 'repair  serious affronts to his human rights and dignity', and he should be  allowed to pursue his case in defence of his escape.

"Both these cases add further weight to the overwhelming evidence  that Australia's immigration detention regime needs to be overhauled,"  Senator Brown said.

"Current policy and practice offends our international obligations - to

ensure that detention is used as a last resort, is not a form of  punishment, nor designed to deter other asylum seekers. It also  offends basic human decency.

"The Greens will campaign in the federal election for a compassionate  immigration policy which includes an end to mandatory detention."
