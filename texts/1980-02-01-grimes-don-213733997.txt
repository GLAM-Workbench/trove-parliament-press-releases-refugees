COMPENSATION FOR COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES

The tragic death of A . B . C . reporter, Tony Joy c e , has highlighted  the poor provision the Commonwealth makes for its employees  killed or severely injured during the course of their work.

In the case of Tony J o y c e , there is the added shame that the

A.B.C. has been willing to send staff to areas of danger but  has not been willing to provide insurance for dangerous  assignments.

In recent days we have learned that Army reservists feel  forced to take out extra private insurance because of the  inadequacy of Commonwealth compensation payments.

The Commonwealth Government, since the Liberal Country Party  came to p o w e r , pays its employees in departments and statutory  authorities the lowest compensation rates in the country for  the bereaved, the widowed and the injured.

In September 1979 Senator Guilfoyle introduced the first  amendments to the Compensation A c t , raising the rates, since  1976. For five years all ex-employees of the Commonwealth  who had suffered as a result of Commonwealth service had  received only one cost of living adjustment. In 1979 the  Government gave 12% rises to people whose living costs in

that time had increased by 36%.

The agreed weekly compensation rate for years had been the  equivalent of 84% of the minimum w a g e , and it held that value  during the time of the Labor Government.  It has now dropped  to 72% of the minimum wage and is likely to continue to d r o p .

The lump sum benefit to widows was raised from $25,000 to only  $28,000, though to keep it on line with the cost of living

rises since 1976 it should have been set at $34,000.

The difficulty of obtaining justice has worsened because the  Government last year saw fit to remove the area of Commonwealth  compensation from Parliament. It will adjust compensation in  future by regulation only, so Parliamentary debate or amendment

cannot take place. Regulations must be either accepted or  rejected.

The losers are the compensation victims, frequently those doing  the heavy and dangerous work in munitions factories, Telecom,   and so on. The Commonwealth Government, the meanest compensation  payer in Australia,  pays i t s e m p l o y e e s only $90 a week, out

of which they must pay all their living and most medical expenses.

I applaud the persistence of groups of compensation victims who  have been organising to fight for their r ights.

However, until there is a national compensation scheme, with  benefits given as near as possible uniformly throughout Australia  to victims of work-related injury, inconsistent and unfair  treatment of ex-workers suffering physical and mental incapacity will continue.

There will be turmoil as is presently happening in Victoria  where the new legislation is considered regressive.  Victims  will suffer from the carelessness of doctors and lawyers,   harassment and neglect, until there is a national scheme. Their awards should be indexed as are Commonwealth superannuation  payments and social security pensions, and their claims to  humane treatment by the Government should be recognised.

LODGEMENT OF INCOME STATEMENTS BY UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFIT APPLICANTS

Over the past year my office and others have received complaints  that income statements are frequently not accepted by a CES  office after a certain time, e.g. 12 noon or 2 p.m.

Government Ministers and their officers have previously  related this practice to the need for income statements to  be lodged in time for cheques to be promptly processed.

The latest Government r e p l y , however, makes it clear that CES  officers who send people a w a y ,  telling them it is too late  to lodge income statements,  irrespective of the travel the  applicant has undertaken, are in the wrong.

Senator D u r a c k , speaking for the Minister for Employment  and Youth A f f a i r s ,  said:

"Refusal to accept income statements does not occur. They are accepted at any time that a CES office is open

to the p u b l i c ,  with the exception that they are not -

accepted prior to the due date of lodgement specified  on the income statement." (3.12.1979)

A CES office is entitled to feature notices showing  preferred hours of lodgement of income statements but it  is not entitled to refuse them so long as that office

is open.

I would be interested to hear whether this Government ruling  is being upheld in all CES offices.  If you are aware of

any CES office still refusing to accept statements after  a specified hour their attention should be drawn to  Senator Durack's statement. Any further difficulties  should be relayed to my office so that we can pursue the

matter with the Government.

AGENT ORANGE AND VIETNAM VETERANS/

The Labor Party has moved in both Houses for a judicial  inquiry into the effects of Agent Orange.and other herbicides  on Vietnam Veterans exposed to them during the period 1962-1970,  when these substances were used to destroy forests and crops

and drive people from their villages in Vietnam.

We also want investigated the possibility of effects on their  offspring and the general dangers of the substances in  general u s e . Â·

2,4,5 >T ,  a constituent of Agent Orange and Dioxin, a dangerous  contaminant, have long been known to have severe effects on  the foetus. In 1976 in Seveso in Lombardy, Italy, an explosion  released large amounts of dioxin in the area surrounding a  factory, causing illness and the evacuation of large ar e a s . The government, despite difficulties with religious beliefs,  provided for women affected to have abortions.

Evidence from Swedish medical teams in Vietnam points to a  high incidence of birth defects in areas exposed to Agent  Orange.

The government has initiated a statistical inquiry to  gather what data is available and this will be helpful^  but a wider inquiry is needed to gather evidence in Australia  and overseas.

A judicial inquiry should be held to protect witnesses from  the efforts of drug companies which produce the herbicides,   who in many inquiries in the U.S.A. used delaying legal .  . manoeuvres to prevent and postpone unfavourable decisions.

2,4,5,T was developed by the military in the U.S.A. as a  biological warfare weapon without any investigation of its  toxicity on animals. There is considerable disquiet in the  community at large about its continued use, and great concern  amongst Vietnam veterans.  .

To clear the a i r ,  to ensure justice is done and seen to be

done, arid to ensure the continued use of the herbicides is  not dangerous to the community, we must have a general and  independent inquiry. .

POSTPONEMENT OF UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFIT - IN WESTERN AUSTRALIA

The application of the work test and the harsher provisions  of the postponement of benefit section of the Social Services  Act enacted last November are already having distressing  consequences to the people least able to protect themselves.

My attention was drawn by the Trades and Labour Council Welfare  Unit of Perth to the situation in P ingelly,  W . A ., where out  of work aboriginal people have been instructed to complete  continuation forms giving the riames of farmers or other

employers whom they have approached to ask for work. It is a

miserable farce. There is no w o r k .  The farmers' sons are

4.

themselves looking for work. The farms are many miles apart.   There is no public transport and no fares assistance. The  circumstances are phsycrally impossible and personally  embarrassing to the unemployed people in the a r e a .

To make matters w o r s e , if they fail to produce enough names  of employers approached they have their benefit postponed.  This is another way of saying that the Department of Social  Security cuts off unemployment benefit from six to twelve  w e e k s , a loss of several hundred dollars, each time. *

They are thus caught in a cycle of d e b t ,  poor housing and

ill health. They are afraid to go into town for fear of

being picked up by police for unpaid debts, for they are so  often thrown into gaol for failing to pay their bills.  .

The total lack of departmental understanding of the situation  comes through in a letter from the Social Security Department  to a spokesman for the group:

"If you are having difficulties in your search for work or  in deciding the range or type of work you should be seeking,  you might find it helpful to discuss these problems. The  Department has a social work service at most offices, and if  you call and ask for help with a personal problem, a social  worker or welfare officer may be able to help you."

Pingelly is l60 km from the nearest CES office in the metropolitan  a r e a . This group of unemployed lacks transport and the department  has cut off their only income. It would be laughable if it were

not so tragic.

The Social Security Department sends field officers in all  directions hoping to cut down social security entitlements,  but it expects unemployed aboriginals to go |l60 km to discuss  problems with a social w o r k e r . They won't s'end out the social  worker but maintain a policy which keeps aboriginal families

at the lowest possible living standards.

What gives the Social Security Department the right to treat  Australian families in this way?

Firs t l y ,  the law enacted by the Fraser Government last y e a r .   Secondly, the discretion of the Director-General of Social  Services, who can declare himself dissatisfied with the  willingness of an unemployed aboriginal in a depressed area

to take work if offered, when inquires would confirm no work exists.

In the November issue of the Social Security Bulletin  I referred to the new postponement provisions as:

".. a perversion of two departments established to  find people work and enable them to live at subsistence  level until they can get a job now being used to hound

the workless and deprive the least settled, the least  literate and the least able to deal with bureaucracy of  any income for up to three months .. thereby driving

the unemployed into despair, debt..."

I take no pleasure in having foreseen the degradation which  would result from the Fraser Government's actions. I can  only hope that the evidence of misery, debt and prison t o '   which the Department has condemned this group of Australians  will lead to some reversal of punitive policies.

SCHOOL TO WORK TRANSITION SCHEME

Three months after the Government announced its 'comprehensive  transition policy' it gave some details on 22 February of  the first half of the $25 million to be spent in 1980. An analysis of the grants of $12.9 million show that they

are really an unsystematic topping up of the present  education system, with a heavy emphasis on careers officers  and vocational courses, already a part of the education system.

Exceptions are $64,000 to Western Australia for city  accommodation for country students, and $500 to the A.C.T.  to pay for a feasibility study of a possible program for  long-term unemployed youth.

They provide no additional jobs for young people who will  receive extra training and advice, be more job-focussed and  therefore have higher expectations. There is no guarantee  that it will not be 'transition from school to the unemployment  que u e '.

The latest CES figures for January 1980 show 205,873 juniors  registered for employment and only 7Â»053 job vacancies  registered with the CES - one for every 30 young people. If all those jobs were filled, nearly 200,000 of the young  would still be jobless.

The Government obviously hopes that training grants to  encourage students to stay around schools and colleges  will take the pressure off the unemployment figures and  save on unemployment benefit payments. I doubt if it will

do it for long. The training allowances are small and  inconsistent, paid only under a few schemes. ,

The money will be gladly accepted by schools and colleges,  though less gladly by States who have to match the grants. The educational institutions will be able to employ more  staff and try a few new courses, but though it does something

for training, it does nothing for unemployment.

Ross Gittins pointed out in the 'Sydney Morning Herald' that  the number of manpower programs was not a reliable guide to  the Government's commitment, for its enthusiasm for its own  schemes waxes and wanes.

Professor Peter Karmel, in his booklet 'Youth, Education and  Unemployment' has stated:

"The expansion of employment opportunities is the  responsibility of economic policy, not of education  or youth policy."

This has always been the view of the Labor Party. Our

policies in Government would be directed to providing  employment, without promising to eliminate the problem  entirely. It would not provide, as this Government does,  an annual announcement of whatever panacea they think will  divert attention from the appallingly high rate of  unemployment.

DIFFERENT VIEWS OF POVERTY

Several writers have identified three basically different  philosophies of poverty.

The first is the traditional or conservative view of the  poor as failures or misfits who have to be helped to adjust  to society’s institutions. There are strong overtones of ,  individual fault in this approach, the poor tend to be

categorised as 1  deserving* or 1undeserving’  and the emphasis  is on minimal services to help them make the necessary  adjustments.

The second approach, known as liberal or preventive, moves  from blaming the individual to blaming society for not  providing enough opportunities for the poor to succeed. This 'scholarship1  position is less judgmental than the

first and can lead to considerable effort to improve the  environment of the poor,  without making any structural  changes in society. Many people believe that this is the  stance taken in the recommendations of the Henderson Poverty  Enquiry.

The third view is that it is the economic and social organisation  of a materialistic,  competitive society that causes poverty.  Proponents of this ’radical'  view argue the need for fundamental  change in the systems of income, wealth and poverty distribution  in order to reduce inequity. Until, and unless this happens,  the poor will be with us and the strategies generated by the  other two approaches no more than a patch-up.

Few people will identify completely with, any one of these  three broad, views. On the contrary most are likely to find  points of agreement with. each. The value of stating them  so baldly is to highlight their basic features and hopefully

to stimulate thought and discussion.

Publicly,  at least, few people would espouse the conservative  view with its aura of self righteousness; except,  that is,  for the inevitable occasion where some poor person's  behaviour justifies all the traditional stereotypes of

fecklessness and sloth.

The liberal approach is attractive for many reasons:  there is concern and perhaps even empathy for the poor, there is  a definite sense of making an effort to improve their lot;  and yet there is no real threat to established positions. Many current welfare programs come under this heading - the

Disadvantaged Schools Program of the Schools Commission is  a clear example.

It takes courage or perhaps foolhardiness to stand up for  the radical view even when there is so much evidence to  support it. In a society which pays more attention to  welfare fraud, than tax evasion, where children of the

7.

professional classes still predominate amongst university  students, where Legal justice is more available to rich  than poor,  and the quality of health cure is dependent on  the patient's purchasing power,  it is hard to be satisfied  with this or that form of supplementary assistance to

solve the poverty problem.

It all boils down to political feasibility. Is the average  Australian voter prepared to believe that the social  institutions which haVe served him well are loaded against  the less affluent, less educated, less confident citizen?

Is the person who has saved and denied himself in order to  live more comfortably prepared to believe that someone else  did not ever have the chance to work,  let alone save?

The crucial question then becomes:  are we honest enough to look at the evidence for the radical view or will we  secure our positions by falling back on the traditional  view - that the poor have only themselves to blame?

There is only one answer to this question. It is time to  stop relying on piecemeal measures.  We need a plan to  create a more equal society by tackling poverty at its  source.  This demands public commitment to long term goals  within which all short term policies play a part.  Such a  program will not be instantly popular but for those who

believe in justice it is the only responsible course of  action. Ã¢ÂÂ
