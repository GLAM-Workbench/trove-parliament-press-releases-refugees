OFFER OF ASSISTANCE TO NAURU



I am pleased to announce that Australia has offered to send a team of senior Australian  officials to Nauru to discuss any additional needs that the Nauruan Government may have in  dealing with the pressures created through medical needs associated with the offshore  processing centre (OPC).

The team will work with authorities in Nauru to ensure that Nauru’s medical services  continue to be adequately equipped to deal with any increased demands as a result of care  properly provided by Nauru in accordance with our Memorandum of Understanding (MOU).

The Australian Government has also today reiterated to the Government of Nauru its  commitment to working cooperatively with Nauru to assist where appropriate with the  medical care of OPC residents, including hunger strikers.

We have also made clear our appreciation for the excellent professional healthcare assistance  that continues to be provided by Nauru to the International Organisation for Migration (IOM)  and by the IOM itself in caring for the health of those who were protesting.

Our commitment to continuing to work with Nauru and with the IOM, and our appreciation of  Nauru’s efforts, were expressed in discussions between senior Australian officials and the  President of Nauru, Rene Harris. Australian officials asked President Harris to identify  Nauru’s medical requirements.

The Australian Government believes strongly that it has fulfilled its obligations under the  MOU but has made clear that it recognises the strains being placed on Nauru hospital and will  consider sympathetically any reasonable requests for additional assistance.

We will continue to discuss this issue with the Government of Nauru.
