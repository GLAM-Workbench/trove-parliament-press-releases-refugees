Minister for Home Affairs  BORDER PROTECTION COMMAND INTERCEPTS VESSEL

(24 February 2010) Border Protection Command today successfully intercepted a suspected  irregular entry vessel.

ACV Ashmore Guardian, operating under the control of Border Protection Command,  intercepted the vessel at 10:45am (AEDST) near West Island, Ashmore Islands.

Initial indications suggest 43 passengers and 4 crew are on board the vessel.

People smuggling is a world-wide problem and Australia is committed to working closely  with our neighbours to combat it. The commitment of our neighbours, through bilateral  cooperation and the Bali Process on People Smuggling, Trafficking in Persons and Related  Transnational Crime, is critical to addressing this most serious issue.

Recent meetings with government officials in Indonesia and Malaysia have led to positive  steps forward in bilateral and regional cooperation to deter people smuggling. These positive  steps forward are being further developed with the second meeting of the Malaysia-Australia  Working Group on People Smuggling and Trafficking in Persons, which is currently  underway in Sydney.

Also, the Australian Federal Police continues to provide support to foreign law enforcement  agencies in their efforts to combat people smuggling activities in the region. These close  working relationships have resulted in a number of arrests and disruptions to people  smuggling ventures in countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and Sri Lanka.

The Australian Government remains vigilant and committed to protecting Australia’s  borders.

The group will be transferred to Christmas Island where they will undergo security, identity  and health checks. Their reasons for travel will also be established.
