Leader of the Opposition

Statement by Bill Hayden,  M.P.Â·

P l . ' W S

The Government.' s decision to suspend aid to Vietnam is  neither wise nor constructive.  It over-rides the view of  the Foreign Minister and ignores the expert advice of the  Department of Foreign Affairs. In fact, it seems to owe  more to the Prime Minister's antipathy towards his Foreign  Minister than- to a rational assessment of Australia's

international relations.  .  ..

The Government is justifiably angry at the allegedly  corrupt aspects of a system through which certain people  leave Vietnam and enter Australia by jumping the queue of  refugees and other potential immigrants with much higher  claims to settle here. .

This problem will not be resolved, however., by ,   suspending, aid. This action is far more likely to weaken  our influence with the Vietnamese Government than to strengthen  it. .

,  The most worrying aspect of developments in the Indo-China  Peninsula is the complete lack of response in most quarters .   to Vietnam's pleas for substantially increased, aid for  restoration and development after the decades of war. -

The result is that Vietnam has had to depend increasingly  on Soviet aid, with the growing risk that she will become  an absolute client State of the Soviet Union, despite her  preference that this should not happen.

The most sensible course of action consistent with .   Western interests is to support a substantial development '   aid program in support of Vietnam as an independent communist  State able to develop her own national identity as

Yugoslavia has done.

With that status she is far more likely to contribute  to regional stability and help to moderate big power tensions.

,  Australia’s action in cutting off aid will do nothing  for either of these objectives. It is an illogical, .   impulsive decision that should be reconsidered immediately.
