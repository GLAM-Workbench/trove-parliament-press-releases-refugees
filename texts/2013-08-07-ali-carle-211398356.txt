PRESENTER:

Who is this?

TONY ABBOTT:

Ali and Blakey, its Tony Abbott here.

PRESENTER:

Hello Tony, nice to hear from you.

TONY ABBOTT:

Ali and Blakey it’s great to be with you, thank you for having me and it is lovely to be in Adelaide.

PRESENTER:

So, a nice relaxed time for you at the moment?

TONY ABBOTT:

Yeah, it is pretty relaxed. I am hoping to go to the Barossa for a few wine tastings and have a good time.

PRESENTER:

We actually saw you and Kevin Rudd on the campaign trail. It was the first time you ran into each other  yesterday, opening the new Afghanistan exhibit at the War Memorial. Now, you guys were standing a metre  apart and much has been said that you didn’t even acknowledge each other. Do you guys really dislike each  other’s guts?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, it’s not true to say we didn’t acknowledge each other. We shook hands at least twice and Kevin very  kindly complimented me on my speech. I had a brief chat to Therese Rein. Look, it’s a bit like a footy match  you know, even if your best mate is on the other side you’re not going to be really warm with him before the  game. You might be pretty good mates after the game, but before the game there is obviously a certain  amount of tension. That is just the way it is.

PRESENTER:

So, you and the Prime Minister will just hit the town as soon as the result is known, is that how it will work?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I’m not sure that it will be quite as jolly as that, but there is inevitably a certain amount of respect at  the senior levels of politics because you don’t get to be Prime Minister of our country, you don’t get to be  the leader of a major political party, without having a certain amount of ability. But in the end it’s not about  Kevin, it’s not about me, it’s about our country. It’s about the voters, it’s about you the people and that is  why I keep saying if you elect us we will build a stronger economy, so that everyone can get ahead. We will  scrap the carbon tax, we will get the budget back under control, we will build the infrastructure of the future,  particularly here in Adelaide. We will put $500 million into improving the South Road just above the  Southern Express Way and we will stop the boats, because that is what people want us to do.

PRESENTER:

Now, you mentioned the word ability back there and I want to bring this up because this has got a lot of  play. One of your Liberal candidates for Greenway, Jaymes Diaz, you know where I’m going with this he  didn’t really get off to a flyer, have a listen…

JAYMES DIAZ:

We have a plan, we have a six point plan to make sure we do stop the boats.

PRESENTER:

Six point plan. Could you run through them for us?

JAYMES DIAZ:

Well, I can run through all the details of the points but look the main thing is…

PRESENTER:

Well, the six points?

PRESENTER:

Look, it didn’t go well for him. What do you feel like you when you have so much riding on this to see one  of your candidates flounder like that?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, the first thing is that all of us freeze up occasionally and one of Mr Rudd’s Minister’s, David Bradbury  had a melt down on radio yesterday as well. That’s the first point to make, the second point I make ok, he  may not have explained the policy very well on that particular instance but he will vote for policies that will

stop the boats whereas the Labor Member for Greenway will not vote for those policies. The Labor Member  for Greenway has been part of the government which started the boats.

PRESENTER:

But you understand Tony…

TONY ABBOTT:

That is the essential point.

PRESENTER:

But you understand at least Tony that people will look at that if you’re going to vote should you know what  those policies are especially if you want to promote and run that. I guess that is where everyone is coming  from.

TONY ABBOTT:

But he knows which side of politics has the record when it comes to stopping the boats and he is supporting  that side of politics whereas the Labor Member for Greenway has supported a Prime Minister who got the  boats started again. Who has no real answer to stopping the boats. Since, Mr Rudd has announced his so  called PNG solution we have had more than 1,700 illegal arrivals by boat and when I  last looked less than  100 had actually gone to PNG. The PNG Government has openly disagreed with Mr Rudd and said ‘No that  we are not going to keep everyone in PNG.’ So look, when it comes to stopping the boats one side is fair  dinkum, the Coalition and the other has a consistent record of failure.

PRESENTER:

Tony, have you sent flowers to Nick Xenophon yet because you might need him to pass some legislation  when you get into power? Have you been nice to him, have you at least had a coffee with him?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well Blakey I get on well with Nick Xenophon. Obviously I want people to vote for Liberal candidates but  nevertheless, I do get on well with Nick, I think he is a decent bloke. I think we will work constructively  together if we are in the new parliament together. Look, I thought he made a good point about the  governments advertising not being directed towards boat people it was directed towards vote people and this  is from a Prime Minister who said before the 2007 election campaign that taxpayer funded political  advertising was and I quote, ‘it is a cancer on our democracy and it shouldn’t happen within six months of  an election’ and then he went on to say that if it does happen it should have the consent of the Leader of the  Opposition. Well, funnily enough when Mr Rudd started to spend $30 million of your money on his re-election he didn’t ask me about first.

PRESENTER:

Well, Tony we can’t unfortunately get into much of a debate here  because of our time constraints but in one  word, one word before we let you go, can you confirm that the first debate  between you and the Prime  Minister will be a Channel Seven Facebook debate? Which is what they are saying at the moment?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, what I’m saying it should be at the National Press Club on Sunday night. And I say Mr Rudd let’s  have a national debate on Sunday night at the National Press Club.
