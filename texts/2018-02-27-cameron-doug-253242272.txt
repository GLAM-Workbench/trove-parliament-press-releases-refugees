E&OE TRANSCRIPT  DOORSTOP  PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA  TUESDAY 27 FEBRUARY 2018

SUBJECTIS: Coalitions secret agreement, vetting of potential migrants, Senate  estimates

SENATOR DOUG CAMERON, SHADOW MINISTER FOR HOUSING AND  HOMELESSNESS, SHADOW MINISTER FOR SKILLS, TAFE AND  APPRENTICESHIPS: I think it is clear that Malcolm Turnbull is still under the complete  control of the National Party and that this secret deal that has been done between  Malcolm Turnbull and the National Party should be made public.

There are newspaper reports in the past that say this deal is not just about  administrative issues. It's about significant policy issues, it's about how Malcolm  Turnbull would deal with marriage equality, how he would deal with a number of other  significant policy matters and that should not be locked in a safe in the Prime Minister's  office.

The public are entitled to know how much Malcolm Turnbull has sold his soul to the  National Party to gain leadership of the Coalition and the Prime Ministership.

JOURNALIST There are reports today that the Home Affairs Department is considering  a scheme whereby intelligence analysts would covertly investigate potential migrants  before they even get to Australia. Just wondering if you have seen those reports and  what's your initial reaction to that proposal?

CAMERON: I haven't seen those reports, but it wouldn't surprise me that this  government would use whatever dog whistle it can against potential refugees, potential

migrants to this country, to try and reach out to the worst elements in the National and

Liberal Party and in the community.

So nothing would surprise me what Peter Dutton would do, nothing would surprise me  how weak the Prime Minister would be in destroying things that he has stood up for in  the past to maintain his leadership.

JOURNALIST: Just in principle, is that a reform that you think we need?

CAMERON: Well I think that we need to get back to some stability in this country. The  only way you are going to get back to some stability where we are not dropping these  thought bubbles time and time again, where we stop attacking migrants in this country,  is through Malcolm Turnbull going to an election and we have an election in this country  that will provide an outcome that would provide a decent government, a government  that is focused on the key issues for Australian's. That is the standard of living, the  capacity to bargain effectively on the job, the capacity to have decent health and  education.

That's the issues that the public are concerned about and these continual dog whistles  from the right wing of the Coalition do this country no good either domestically or for its  standing internationally. We have got a Prime Minister who has got absolutely no  capacity to stand up and argue for decency, for good policy, because we have got a  secret agreement that stops him doing that.

JOURNALIST: Are there any particular lines of inquiry you will be pursuing in estimates  today?

CAMERON: Well my area of estimates - the ABCC, the ROC, the Fair Work  Ombudsman. All organisations that are being infiltrated by the Coalition with senior  people from the Coalition in key positions in those organisations running attacks against  the trade union movement, running attacks against unionists, and workers trying to get  out and get a decent pay rise and fight to save their wages and conditions.

These are issues that we will look at and we have also got the unresolved issue of  Senator Canavan and what his involvement was in the movement of the individual who  is the partner of Barnaby Joyce from one office to another, we will be pursuing that as  well.
