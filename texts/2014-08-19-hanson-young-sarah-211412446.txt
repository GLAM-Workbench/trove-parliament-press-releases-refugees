Offshore children must be freed

Releasing some children from mainland detention while leaving the majority locked up in the  horrendous conditions on Nauru and Christmas Island is unacceptable, the Australian Greens have  said.

"The Abbott government is destroying hundreds of vulnerable children by locking them up in  appalling conditions offshore," the Greens' immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young  said.

"Australians are becoming increasingly uncomfortable with the incarceration of refugee children.

"Any discussion of kids in detention cannot ignore the billions of dollars being spent on cruelty to  children on Christmas Island and Nauru.

"Recently we've seen the sad truth of life for children in these detention camps. Skyrocketing mental  health concerns, sexual abuse and children self harming are the daily experience of these children.

"What this shows is that children don't belong in detention, but the problem is that the majority of  children will remain incarcerated on Christmas Island and Nauru.

"The Abbott government should close the camps, save billions of dollars and end the unnecessary  cruelty. The Immigration Minister can and should do that today."
