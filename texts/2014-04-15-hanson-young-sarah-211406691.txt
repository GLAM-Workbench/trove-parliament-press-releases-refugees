Morrison preaching cruelty to Asia

The Immigration Minister’s request that our closest neighbours strengthen their response to  people seeking asylum is an embarrassing next step in the Abbott Government’s war on  refugees, the Australian Greens have said.

“Touring the region and advocating for crueller treatment of refugees is no way for Australia to  behave,” the Greens’ immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.

“Gone are the days when Scott Morrison was ‘shocked by the treatment that people receive in  Malaysia.’ Now he wants them to get tougher.

“By playing to the bigots, the Abbott Government has cynically perfected their faux compassion  and opportunistic, chest-thumping cruelty. They are now exporting that approach to the region  and damaging Australia’s reputation as they go.

“Rather than touring Asia and touting cruelty, the Abbott Government should be leading a  genuine regional solution that cares for refugees while saving lives at sea.

“Improving asylum processing in the region and boosting the number of refugees that Australia  takes will save money and stop the boats by giving people a safer way to reach protection.”
