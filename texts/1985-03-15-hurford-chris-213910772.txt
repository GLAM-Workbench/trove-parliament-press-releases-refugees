MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION  AND ETHNIC AFFAIRS

The Hon. CHRIS HURFORD, M.P.

MPS 15/85

NATIONAL POPULATION COUNCIL : SECOND MEETING

The National Population Council discussed today in   Sydney the migration program for 1985-86 in the l i g h t  of

progress thus f a r  with the 1984-85 program.

The program c e i l i n g  in 1984-85 was 74,000 but the

outcome was expected to be s l i g h t l y  lower according to

the Minister fo r Immigration and Ethnic A f f a i r s ,  Chris

Hurford, who chaired the meeting.

Mr. Hurford said the Government would be taking   decisions on the 1985-86 program sh ortly.

"As the Council recognises, decisions on the program   have to balance competing social and economic pressures.

"The Government w i l l  consider the capacity of the

economy to absorb the proposed i n t a k e , as well as

pressures fo r family reunion and in te r n a t io n a l

obligations under refugee and humanitarian programs."

The Council also considered:

. whether, in the l i g h t  of the controversy about

migration in 1984, action should be taken to

increase community awareness and understanding of   immigration and ethnic issues;

. d i f f i c u l t i e s  faced by migrants in ge ttin g adequate

access to community programs and services;

. a possible major evaluation and review in 1986 of

post a r r i v a l  programs and services fo r  migrants.

Mr. Hurford welcomed to the meeting Mr. P h ilip  Ruddock,   the Opposition spokesman on Immigration and Ethnic   A f f a i r s , who was present as an observer with the rig h t

to p a rt ic ip a te  in discussion.

"A bipartisan approach is most important in this

sensitive policy a r e a " , the Minister said.
