TPVs lock refugees into life of limbo

The TPV deal struck between the Coalition and the Palmer United Party will see thousands of  refugees doomed to a life of permanent limbo and many more families and children left to  languish in the offshore gulags on Nauru and Manus Island, the Australian Greens have said.

“This deal has seen Palmer being played by the ruthless Abbott government,” the Greens’  immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.

“Temporary Protection Visas leave refugees living in a permanent limbo without family reunion.

“Under these new rules, the road to permanent residency is long, extremely narrow and most  refugees will never make it.

“The bill introduced today is a shocking piece of legislation. TPVs are just one part of the far  reaching and indiscriminate cruelty it contains.

“Scrapping the Refugee Convention from Australian law is an appalling move that clearly shows  what this government thinks when it comes to protecting those in need.”
