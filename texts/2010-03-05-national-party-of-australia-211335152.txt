LABOR’S FAILED BORDER PROTECTION

Friday, 05 March 2010

Before the last election Kevin Rudd was talking tough on border protection promising  he would turn back the boats. Since Labor was elected, not one boat has been  turned back, with 86 arrivals, carrying almost 4000 people.

Kevin Rudd has failed to maintain the strong border protection regime he inherited  from the Coalition, The Nationals Member for Riverina, Kay Hull, has said.

“The latest boat brings this year’s tally to 18 boats and more than 950 people. That’s  as many boats and even more people that arrived in the last six years of the  Coalition Government,” Mrs. Hull said.

“Under Labor we have gone from an average of three illegal boat arrivals per year to  two boats every week!

“The arrival of yet another boat, as more tents go up on Christmas Island, is further  proof of the Government’s failure to honour their promise. For this Kevin Rudd must  take responsibility and acknowledge his inability to deliver.

“Australia’s border protection is in disarray and not even the Minister responsible is  willing to reveal how bad the situation has become,” Mrs. Hull said.
