As announced today by the Prime Minister,

my wife and I have been invited to attend the Queen's

Silver Jubilee Thanksgiving service in London on 7 June.

We have accepted the Lord Chamberlain's invitation to

attend the service and the Australian Goveirnment'  s  invitation to spend that week in London.

While in London I shall take the opportunity #  '

to renew acquaintances with Commonwealth Heads of Government

whom I have met at the 1973 and 1975 meetings.

On my way home, I intend to visit Brussels  for discussions with the European communities, Vienna

for discussions with the International Atomic Energy Ã¢ÂÂ

Agency and Damascus, where an Australian Embassy has

just been opened and where most Lebanese refugees proceed  in efforts to be reunited with their relatives in Australia.

CANBERRA.
