TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW - CHANNEL 10 MORNING NEWS WITH NATARSHA  BELLING

SUBJECT:  IMMIGRATION; CARBON PRICE.

E  & O E - PROOF ONLY



BELLING: Finance Minister, Senator Penny Wong. Good morning Senator. Thanks for your  time this morning.

WONG: Morning Tarsh.

BELLING: Firstly, this breaking story out of Canberra. What’s your reaction to Mr Crook’s  decision today. Surely this is an embarrassment for the Government.

WONG: Mr Crook’s vote wouldn’t even be an issue if Tony Abbott did something other than  what he always does, which is to wreck and oppose. Because Mr Abbott’s position here is  that he supports offshore processing, but he won’t allow amendments to the legislation  which would enable any government to put in place offshore processing. So he’s voting  against something he supports, because he’s so keen to just wreck and oppose.

BELLING: But Senator, this is, we’ve even seen this morning that this is being rejected on  the basis of humanitarian grounds. Obviously there are serious concerns with the way that  this is being proposed. This is embarrassing for the Federal Government.

WONG: On humanitarian grounds, what I’d say is this: we put in place a great many  protections in the Malaysia arrangement, protections even the High Commissioner for  Refugees has commented positively on. And I think Mr Abbott and the Opposition are not in  any position to lecture anyone on being humanitarian. I mean, they want to tow the boats  back, something we know is dangerous, that is advised against. That’s what they’re saying  they’ll do.

But in terms of the Government, we had a very important vote yesterday, as you know  Natarsha. We’re a minority government, but we got through the House of Representatives  an important reform, that’s about the clean energy jobs of tomorrow, and looking after the  interests of the next generation of Australians.

BELLING: You’ve just mentioned that Senator, that was my next question, regarding the  carbon tax. You say it’s good news for the Government, you’re obviously very happy with it.  But the bottom line is there is a lot of anger still out in the community about this. Why didn’t  you give Australians the chance to have their say on the carbon tax? Especially when the  Prime Minister promised there would be no carbon tax before she went to the election.

WONG: Well Tarsh, I don’t think its good news for the Government, I think it’s the right  thing for the country. And that’s what is important. And in terms of having our say, this has  been talked about in Australia for many, many years. 2006 was when, for example, major  businesses called on the then Prime Minister Howard to put in place a price on carbon.

We went to the 2007 election, as did John Howard, promising a price on carbon. We battled  to get it through the last parliament. You might have recalled I was part of that and we  weren’t able to get it through because of what happened inside the Liberal Party. We’re  pleased that this has got through the Parliament, or the House of Representatives, not  because it is good for the Government, but because it is the right thing for the country.

BELLING: So the Prime Minister was certainly thrilled yesterday, even embracing and  sharing a kiss with Kevin Rudd. Some critics have said that it was the Judas kiss. What are  your thoughts?

WONG: Some of those people are people in the Opposition who are prone to a whole heap  of very strong language these days. We heard Mr Abbott going on about things being  written in blood. Really, this sort of way of talking about politics I don’t think is what  Australians are interested in.

BELLING: A lot of love in the room. Thanks so much for joining us this morning Penny  Wong, joining us there from Canberra.

WONG: Good to be with you, Tarsh.
