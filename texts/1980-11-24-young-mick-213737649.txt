PRESS RELEASE

MICK YOUNG, MP, SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND ETHNIC AFFAIRS

There are two essential questions which have remained unanswered

by the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs.  What are the

objectives of the Government with the ever-increasing immigrant

intake and how do they intend to care for them once in Australia?

Mr Young was commenting on the proposal that the North Head

Quarantine Station in Sydney be turned into a refugee centre.

The Department of Administrative Services in co-operation with the

Department of Immigration, proposes to accommodate some 1,000

refugees a year in the centre.

It is typical of the Liberal Government to decide to bring more

than 100,000 immigrants to Australia without any help or consultation

with the States.

If they cannot even plan for accommodation for these people, how

will they find jobs for them? ?  "

The public is entitled to know whether or not there is any relationÂ­

ship between the immigrant intake and the number of jobs available.

The Australian people would also like to know, has the Government

any policy re. the future of the 400,000 unemployed in Australia.
