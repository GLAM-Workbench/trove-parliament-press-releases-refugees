E&OE……………………….…………………………………………………………………

JOHN SHAW:

Good morning, Tony. How are you?

TONY ABBOTT:

I’m good John, how’s yourself?

JOHN SHAW:

Well thank you. The charity bike ride you’re involved with, what’s that all about?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well John, this is the 14th annual Pollie Pedal bike ride. I’ve got Senator Guy Barnett and Josh Frydenberg  my parliamentary colleagues with me today. Over the years I’ve had a lot of MPs join me and we’ve raised  money for a lot of good causes, the Royal Flying Doctor Service, medical research at Westmead Hospital.  This year we’re raising money for indigenous health scholarships because if we’re going to improve  Aboriginal health indicators we’ve got to improve the services and the more Aboriginal people we can have  working in health the better. So, that’s what we’re doing.

JOHN SHAW:

So you rode from Dorrigo to Armidale yesterday and you’re off to Walcha today. You’re in a nice part of  the world.

TONY ABBOTT:

It’s a beautiful part of the world although I’ve got to say as we rode out of Dorrigo yesterday in a howling  sou’easter, the rain and the mist around our ears, I thought to myself it would be nice to be in a car with a  fuel-injected six cylinder under the bonnet.

JOHN SHAW:

You had a meeting in Armidale last night. How did that go?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think it went pretty well. I think there were a few cameras around so if there were any muck-ups, no doubt  they’ll be broadcast. I thought the meeting went ok, John. Quite a decent crowd. I think there were two or  three spare seats down in the front row. Apart from that, every seat was filled including some young people  from the coalition for action on climate change. So, it wasn’t all my way, you might say.

JOHN SHAW:

The latest Newspoll in The Australian newspaper yesterday shows if a federal election was held today you’d  be Prime Minister. Now, as Opposition Leader such a poll must be heartening; is the Opposition doing  something right or is the minority Gillard Government digging a hole for itself?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I try not to focus too much on polls, John. I try to look at the field evidence and certainly on this trip  the field evidence is that people are very unhappy with the Gillard Government, particularly the carbon tax.  They think that she should have been honest about it before the election. They don’t like the impact on the  cost of living, on the price of power, on the price of petrol and diesel and I think on this trip at least the  public say well good on you for getting out of your suit and your office and your white car and seeing a part  of Australia that’s a bit off the beaten political track for senior party leaders. So obviously it’s good to be  here, John, and I have to say that if I have more public meetings like last night I think it will be good for  politics generally and good for the Coalition.

JOHN SHAW:

Do you think the proposed carbon tax had a bearing on the result of the New South Wales election 11 days  ago?

TONY ABBOTT:

Of course it did, John. Barry O’Farrell made it front and centre of the campaign. The only person who thinks  it had no impact is the Prime Minister and she’s in denial and this is the problem. If the Prime Minister did  less spinning and more listening she’d be effective.

JOHN SHAW:

You’d have to be an interested bystander at the moment. Kevin Rudd, there’s some ructions there and Mark  Latham’s coming out this morning and said Julia Gillard should challenge Kevin Rudd if he’s got any  ambitions to take over the leadership again.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I think it’s really important that there be Cabinet discipline and Julia Gillard insists that she’s not  going to talk about what happened in Cabinet but she’s the only one it seems, and I think that the Prime  Minister does need to restore Cabinet discipline because an ill-disciplined Government is bad for people. I  mean, in the end it’s got to be about serving the people, not about rewriting history or making a big hero of  yourself in retrospect or saying one thing before the election and something different afterwards. I mean, in  the end it’s about a better job for the Australian people and that’s what they’re not getting from this badly

divided government and this Cabinet that’s obviously full of interpersonal poison.

JOHN SHAW:

The establishment of a detention centre in Tasmania; that’s certainly going to cause some concern?

TONY ABBOTT:

Ã¢ÂÂ¨Yeah and I think my colleague Scott Morrison made the good point that when the Government said it was  going to have an offshore processing centre who would have thought they meant Tasmania? I mean, before  the election the Prime Minister kept talking about East Timor as the solution to the boat people crisis but  since the election we’ve had five new onshore detention centres announced and the East Timor solution has  sunk without trace somewhere in the Timor Sea.

JOHN SHAW:

What’s the situation with Nauru?

TONY ABBOTT:

Nauru would welcome any call from the Australian Prime Minister. The centre that Australian taxpayers  built in Nauru is still there. It’s quite serviceable. Scott Morrison went to look at it during the election  campaign. He says that within a matter of weeks at most it could be once more receiving people and the  Government of Nauru is very happy to open it. So, if the Gillard Government is serious about third country  processing they really should pick up the phone to the President of Nauru straight away.

JOHN SHAW:

It seems strange. The facility’s there, the country wants to do what the Government needs being done and  yet they won’t do it?

TONY ABBOTT:

That’s right and the strongest possible signal you could send to the people smugglers that the game was up  would be to reopen the centre in Nauru.

JOHN SHAW:

They’re basically putting out the welcome mat by establishing a detention centre in Tasmania, aren’t they?

TONY ABBOTT:

Exactly right because the people smugglers say ‘hand over your $10,000 or your $15,000, we’ll get you to  Australia and once you’re there you’ll get permanent residency’, and of course by taking people from these  boats more or less directly to Tasmania or to South Australia or to outer metropolitan Perth or to the new  centre they’re building in Darwin or to Cape York, all these other places where they’re building centres - in  fact, basically anywhere where there’s a disused military camp is now in line for a detention centre - by  bringing people to Australia they’re vindicating the people smugglers’ claims.

JOHN SHAW:

Incredible, isn’t it? It really is. Prime Minister Julia Gillard recently called the Greens an extreme party. Do  you think she’s being fair dinkum in saying that or is she just appeasing some of the parts of the Labor Party

who are a bit concerned about the Government getting too close to the Greens?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well John, I think that’s a pretty shrewd observation implicit in your question and I think that it’s a very odd  Prime Minister who forms a government with the Greens and then calls them extreme. I think again, it’s a  Prime Minister who’s trying to have her cake and eat it too. It’s a Prime Minister who’s trying to be all  things to everyone but in the end people think she completely lacks conviction.

JOHN SHAW:

Alright, thanks Tony.

TONY ABBOTT:

John, I appreciate the chance to talk to you and look forward to talking to you again.

JOHN SHAW:

No, thank you very much. It’s certainly been a pleasure on this end and I also look forward to catching up  with you at a later date.

TONY ABBOTT:

Thanks so much.

JOHN SHAW:

Thank you.
