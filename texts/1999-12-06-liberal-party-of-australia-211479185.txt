Partial Transcript of Doorstop on East Timorese 
Leaving Safe Havens

Â

6 December 1999

Â

MINISTER RUDDOCK:

Â

Last night we arranged for the voluntary return of 
some 503 East Timorese to East Timor. This was in accordance with arrangements 
that we had put in place to evacuate numbers of people who were in the 
UN Compound in Dili and they were brought here on visas that were valid 
until the 8  th  of December and would have expired this week.

Â

We put in place the return arrangements in consultation 
with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees as well as the 
International Organisation for Migration. The departure of people from 
the Leeuwin Barracks in Western Australia, Puckapunyal in Victoria and 
East Hills occurred largely as planned.

Â

We are now going to make arrangements to consolidate 
the three safe haven sites into one. It will be necessary for people 
who are being accommodated within Australia to remain in one centre 
where we can best continue to provide for their needs.

Â

It is the case I think in relation to Leeuwin in Western 
Australia for instance, that the numbers of people are sufficiently 
small in total but to maintain a centre that can accommodate over 500 
people with less than 150 or so people in it would cost the Australian 
tax payers very large amounts of money. The estimates I have is that 
it will continue to maintain separate centres it would be of the order 
of one million dollars per month.

Â

Now I have indicated and I have a degree of disappointment 
that a number of well meaning people are suggesting to the East Timorese 
as they did with the Kosovars before, that the choice and location of 
Safe Haven is something for the individual to make. Obviously when you 
are making provision for services to meet peoples’ need for food, 
to cloth, house, render appropriate help, torture and trauma counselling, 
and meet other needs, you need to do it in the most effective and efficient 
way.

Â

There were a small number of people in Perth who were 
not well enough to travel and as I say, last evening, some well-meaning 
people discouraged the group that was to move, from doing so. I don’t 
think it was fair to the individuals involved to encourage them to think 
they would be able to stay on in Perth.

Â

I understand that there was a view that people should 
be moved as a whole. The reason they weren’t being moved together 
was that some people had recently had operations, very often associated 
with middle ear infections and other conditions of that character... 
where to put them on an aeroplane would in fact be quite deleterious 
to their health and for that reason it’s quite inappropriate to demand 
that you necessarily move a large group of people all at one time.

Â

REPORTER:

Â

People who have refused to go... have they had their 
freedoms taken away?

Â

MINISTER:

Â

In relation to what is happening, let me make it very 
clear. People were aware of the intention of the Department to make 
arrangements for the consolidation once the larger group had returned 
top East Timor. That information had been made available for some time 
and people had been counselled and had not expressed any concern.

Â

My principle concern in relation to this matter are 
the efforts of those who would claim they are well meaning and helpful.. 
.offering advice to people that shouldn’t move.

Â

Now it is the case that consolidation arrangements 
are such that the additional and supplementary benefits that we provide, 
will be provided at East Hills. They will not be provided at Leeuwin 
in Perth. So if people expect allowances to be paid, then they’ll 
go to where they are going to be paid. It’s not a matter of picking 
and choosing. It’s a matter of ... if people want as some of the Kosovars 
did.... to live in the community... those who want them to live in the 
community can support them.

Â

We will support them with taxpayers funds at East 
Hills.

Â

REPORTER:

Â

Will they be fed in Leeuwin?

Â

MINISTER:

Â

They’ll be fed.
