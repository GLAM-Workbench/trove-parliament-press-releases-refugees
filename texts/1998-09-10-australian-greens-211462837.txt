Greens 
Reject Zero-net Immigration

Â

Greens Victorian Senate Candidate 
Charmaine Clarke today launched the Australian Greens immigration and 
population policies in Melbourne with ethnic Green candidates.

Â

"The   Greens are putting forward a humanitarian and far 
sighted immigration policy that celebrates Australia's migrant identity," 
said Ms Clarke

Â

"In a year when immigration has been such a 
controversial issue the Greens are championing the rights of migrants. 
The Greens believe that the presence in Australia of people of many 
cultural backgrounds enriches our society.

Â

"Unlike One Nation and the Democrats the Greens 
reject zero-net migration as unjust and inequitable.

Â

"The Greens have a proud track record in the 
Senate of supporting non-discriminatory immigration and the rights of 
refuges and asylum seekers. In the Senate we opposed the two-year waiting 
period for social security benefits and support the repeal of this inhumane 
legislation.

Â

"After the first Australians, this country has 
been built on migrants," said Ms Clarke herself an indigenous Australian.

Â

The Policy is based on the goals 
of.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢Â   Non discrimination

Ã¢ÂÂ¢Â   Australia must honour its international refugee obligations

Ã¢ÂÂ¢Â   Australia should maintain a program of immigration 
based predominantly on family reunions.

The policy 
includes:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢Â   Support for the preferential category (spouses, dependent 
children and 'balance of family parents') of the Family Reunion program.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢Â   Reviewing the criteria for immigrants to ensure that 
potential immigrants are not unfairly discriminated against by, for 
instance, the requirement to be fluent in English.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢Â   Services for new migrants should include access to 
social security and English language classes and where appropriate post-trauma 
counselling.

- Greens Immigration Policy -

Â

Principles

Â

The Australian Greens recognise original and ongoing 
ownership of the Australian territory by indigenous peoples. The great 
majority of the nation's contemporary population is the result of immigration 
from countries of the Commonwealth and Europe, and, more recently, from 
Asia and countries of the Pacific.

Â

This policy considers contemporary immigration issues 
in the context of social and ecological sustainability.

Â

The Australian Greens believe that Australia's immigration 
policy must be set within a broader population policy and be based on 
respect for human rights.

Â

Australia's immigration policy must be non-discriminatory 
on the grounds of race, nationality, ethnic origin, religion, language, 
gender, disability, sexual preference, age or socio-economic background, 
and guided by humanitarian as well as ecological principles.

Â

The Australian Greens take a position that the presence 
in Australia of people of many cultural backgrounds enriches our society.

Â

The Australian Greens feel the necessity for a change 
in Australian consciousness with regard to the need for reduced consumption 
and improved technologies.

Â

Goals

Â

Australia has international obligations to accept 
refugees and it must honour these obligations.

Â

Australia should maintain a programme of voluntary 
immigration based predominantly on family reunions and other special 
humanitarian criteria.

Â

Short Term Targets

Â

The Australian Greens propose that:

Â

a) asylum seekers be given 
the fullest opportunity to establish their individual refugee status. 
This should not interfere with the rights of applicants off-shore who 
are equally anxious to settle in Australia;

Â

b) the conditions of asylum 
seekers be equi  table, that staff dealing with asylum seekers be 
trained in cross-cultural communication and that asylum seekers have 
full access to legal advice concerning their options;

Â

c) the preferential category (spouses, dependent 
children and 'balance of family parents') of the Family Reunion Programme 
be maintained and monitored;

Â

d) accommodation for immigrants deemed to be illegal 
should meet international standards and procedures for considering their 
eligibility should be improved and made more humane as stipulated by 
the international conventions we have ratified;

Â

e) criteria for eligibility should be reviewed to 
ensure that potential immigrants are not unfairly discriminated against 
by, for instance, the requirement to be fluent in English; and

Â

(f) services for new migrants should include access 
to social security, English language classes and appropriate programs 
to facilitate transition to Australia's multicultural society, with 
access to post-trauma counselling where needed.

- Greens Population Policy -

Â

Principles

Â

Neither the planet, nor any 
country, can sustain continued human population growth at the level 
of resource use of most Australians. Four Earths would be required for 
all human inhabitants to live at the level of most Australians. However, 
the   relationship between people and environments is 
a complex one, not reducible simply to carrying capacity, but mediated 
by economic, social, political, cultural and technological considerations. 
The Australian government should consult with the widest possible range 
of interest groups to arrive at a population policy which respects human 
rights.

Â

The basis for Australia's population policy, both 
domestic and global, must be ecological sustainability, intergenerational 
equity and social justice. A precautionary approach is required in order 
to take into account the consequences of human impact on the environment.

Â

In order to achieve a sustainable population, action 
must be taken on consumption levels and technology use as well as population 
size. We must generate less waste and implement technologies, such as 
those based on renewable energy, which are more environmentally benign.

Â

The consumption patterns of many in our comparatively 
wealthy country are contributing to global as well as to local environmental 
problems and we have a responsibility to current and future generations 
to ensure that we do not knowingly degrade their world. As Australians 
we also have a responsibility towards non-human species, many of which 
have already become extinct or endangered since European settlement. 
Government policies and taxation systems are tools which can be used 
to change consumption patterns over the medium to long term, and to 
protect and manage ecosystems vulnerable to human activity.

Â

Australia must contribute towards achieving a globally 
sustainable population. We should set an example by:

Â

a) managing our own population growth in accordance 
with more equitable consumption patterns in relation to the international 
context; and

b) redirecting the bulk of aid towards eradicating 
poverty and towards those programmes which empower women.

In attaining a sustainable population Australia must 
shift its involvement in a competitive world economy to a more cooperative, 
regional, self-sufficient economy based on equality and human rights.

Â

Goals

Â

An Australian population policy should consider the 
distribution of human settlements rather than just concentrate upon 
population size at the national level. The continuing de-settlement of 
rural areas must be considered in the light of ecological and social 
sustainability and efforts must be set in place to reverse it in those 
areas where settlement is ecologically benign. The ecological and social 
viability of areas expected to experience great growth needs to be safeguarded, 
and appropriate planning processes set in place. Human settlements should 
be designed and built to minimise environmental and maximise social 
well-being. Investing in the social well-being of the entire population 
should be the main aim of governments, so that there are publicly provided 
services of the highest possible standard. These services should include 
education, infrastructure, health, employment and income support.

Â

Short Term Targets

Â

The Australian Greens will work towards:

Â

a) implementing the Programme of Action agreed to 
by the International Conference on Population and Development in 1994 
by lifting the level of our contribution to programmes which empower 
women and increase their access to a wide range of safe family planning 
options in our overseas aid budget to 4% of the total aid budget;

b) legislation to ensure that Australian aid reaches 
0.7% by the year 2000; and

c) the direction of aid to those programmes which 
benefit the very poor and to those which increase women's control over 
their lives; and

d) ensuring that Australian family planning programmes, 
both domestically and overseas, deliver services in the context of reproductive 
health programmes which increase the power of girls and women to determine 
their own reproductive lives, and increase the understanding of men 
of their reproductive responsibilities
