would eventually replace  English, but rather,  in  the words of its organisÂ­ ers :

.  define Australia's  language needs and resourÂ­  ces and raise public  awareness of them;

.  ensure community partiÂ­ cipation in formulating  policies;

.  influence governments to  give language policies a  high priority; and

.  develop and co-ordinate  language program initiaÂ­ tives at Federal and State  levels.

A lot of emphasis was  placed on the teaching of  community languages in  Australian schools and

tertiary institutions, but  English instruction for  migrants and refugees was  a major theme also.

An interesting point  raised in one of the workÂ­

shops was that due to the  Government's new emphasis  on family reunion as guidÂ­ ing principle for AustraÂ­

lia's migration policy, a  lot of newcomers no longer  spend any time in migrant  hostels when they arrive  here. A consequence of  this is that they tend to  miss out on orientation

programs conducted there.  This includes 300 hours of  English instruction, as  recommended in the Gal-

bally Report.  It was felt  that this works to the  disadvantage of newly  arrived migrants,  and that

this should be taken up  elsewhere. One suggestion  was that English instrucÂ­ tion should take place at

the workplace along with  other on-the-job training.

Although this was objected  to by representatives from  the Employers' Federation,  it seems to be a proposiÂ­ tion worthy of further  examination.

”IN OTHER W O R D S ” From MICK YOUNG m . p . Shadow Minister for Immigration  and Ethnic Affairs

No. 2, May 1982

Editorial -NEW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION & ETHNIC AFFAIRS

As you will be aware,  on 7 May the fourth Fraser  Ministry was sworn in, and John Hodges became the  new Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. I view with some indignation the low profile that

has been given to the portfolio: it was moved from  number 17 to 26 and assigned to the most junior  Minister in the Cabinet. This is no doubt  indicative of the present Government's lack of

commitment to ethnic communities.

The former Minister, Mr Ian Macphee, had brought  to the portfolio a sensitive and compassionate  approach and I regret his departure from it. I  would be most surprised if the new Minister can  Ã¢ÂÂ¢  follow in his footsteps. As far as I can ascertain

2

Mr Hodges has never shown any great interest in  matters of concern to the ethnic communities,  his  service on the Liberal Party's backbench committee  on immigration notwithstanding. In his Queensland

electorate of Petrie he would have had little  contact with non-British migrants or refugees, and  he certainly has never shown any awareness of  their problems in Parliament.

However,  I do hope that the new Minister will do  everything he can to assist migrant communities  from now on. I will certainly do my utmost to see  that he understands the ramifications of his portÂ­

folio so that we can give the best possible  service to migrants and refugees.

IN PARLIAMENT ...

Two major issues relating to immigration were  debated in Parliament during the past month. One followed a report on demographic trends in  Australia tabled by the then Minister for

Immigration and Ethnic Affairs on 4 May; the other  concerned the review of the Australian Citizenship  Act proposed by the Minister on 6 May.

REVIEW OF CITIZENSHIP  ACT

A review of the current  Citizenship Act is long  overdue and I welcome  the Minister's

initiative in this reÂ­ gard. The Act contains  many anomalies,  disÂ­  crimination on the

grounds of sex and ethnic  origin,  and makes unÂ­ reasonable demands on  many who wish to become  Australian citizens.

Many people,  for example,   find it difficult to  understand that in this  great independent nation  of Australia, they have

7

temporary positions and  they will apparently be  rotated, for a short  period, among the Sydney

and surrounding areas  regional offices. It is  not yet clear what kind of

action the Department inÂ­ tends to take once these  studies have been completÂ­ ed, but I have asked the  Minister, Senator Chaney,

to keep me informed of  this. In the meantime, I  suggest that people make  use of those services  where they are available

so that the needs of non-  English speaking people  can be properly assessed.

MIGRATION REVIEW PANEL

My office has received a  number of inquiries reÂ­ garding the procedure for  applying to the Migration

Review Panel, which may  be another indication of  the DIEA's failure to exÂ­ tensively publicise and

inform people of their  rights. However, these  are the procedures to  follow: an applicant must  complete a "Request for  Review" and send it to  the Minister for ImmigraÂ­

tion and Ethnic Affairs

in Canberra. "Request for  Review" forms are availÂ­ able at DIEA regional  offices. The Minister  will pass this on to the

Panel, which will consider  the request and make all  necessary inquiries. The

applicant will not normalÂ­ ly be invited to meet the  Panel, but will be informÂ­ ed of its decision by

letter. It is important,   therefore, to put one's  case down comprehensively  and clearly on the initial  application.

NATIONAL LANGUAGE POLICY  CONFERENCE

About 250 people, mainly  from the NSW Public ServÂ­ ice, Ethnic Organisations  and educational instituÂ­  tions, attended this ConÂ­

ference in Sydney, 14-16  May. It was jointly hosÂ­ ted and organised by the  Ethnic Affairs Commission  of NSW, Ethnic Communities'  Council of NSWZand the  Department of Immigration

and Ethnic Affairs.

Contrary to press reports  the Conference's aim was  not to find a second  Australian language which

6

believes that there will  be some improvement in  staffing numbers,  but so  far the matter has not

been resolved.  I have  asked the Minister to  move speedily on this  because a lot of people

have been extremely disÂ­ appointed with the way  the Department has dealt  with them to date.

interests of women are  properly advanced. The  Department proposes to  establish a small commitÂ­

tee to ensure that these  matters are properly canÂ­ vassed. Mr Menadue adÂ­ mitted, however,  that "as

a result of the RCF  (Review of Commonwealth  Functions; i.e. the  "Razor Gang") decision we  do not have the same

focus that we had before."

WOMEN'S SERVICES FIRST TO  GO

As already mentioned,   following the "Razor  Gang" recommendations,   the DIEA lost 92 posiÂ­  tions. It is not yet  clear which of the  migrant services will be  most severely effected,

except for one area where  it is perfectly clear;  women's services. The  Department's one and only  women's services position  was among the first casuÂ­

alties. When asked how  the functions of the  women's unit are now  being conducted, Mr  Menadue replied that it

is now the responsibility  of relevant sections and  branches in the DepartÂ­ ment to ensure that the

MULTI-LINGUAL COUNTER  STAFF - A PILOT SCHEME

The Department of Social  Security is currently  conducting two little  publicised studies into  the needs of non-English  speaking clients. One of  those is already in proÂ­ gress and will end on 30  June, the other will run

for about three months  commencing in June.

The first project inÂ­  volves the use of interÂ­ preting services already  in existence, while the

second will use the  services of multi-lingual  counter staff. Five  people are currently  being trained for these

3

to swear allegiance to Her  Majesty Queen Elizabeth  II. The ALP has adopted a  policy of seeking that, in

the long term, Australia  should be a Republic.  Taking out citizenship  could become a lot more

attractive to people if  they could swear allegÂ­ iance to the Constitution  of Australia.

Furthermore, it is my firm  belief that we should not  try to insist that people

break off their links with  their homelands.  Thus,  the wording of the reÂ­ nunciation of these in the  present Oath of Allegiance  needs to be reviewed.

Discrimination contained  in the Act must also be  eliminated. All citizens  and intending citizens  should be treated as  equals. Australia has a  history of giving preferÂ­

ential treatment to  British migrants and once  collectively supported the  "White Australia" policy.  Few would wish us to reÂ­ turn to such a position,   but the present Act still  discriminates on the  grounds of ethnic origin.

Similarly, sex discrimÂ­ ination must go. For  example,  parentage  rather than mother or

fatherhood should be the  determining factor in a  child's right to  citizenship.

The Minister announced  this review of the  Citizenship Act in order  to give the major migrant

communities the  opportunity to discuss  matters relating to  Australian citizenship

and I would certainly  welcome such community  involvement. There are

a number of topics that  require extensive inÂ­  vestigation ,  among them  being the language reÂ­ quirement, whether the

right to vote should be  dependent upon citizenÂ­ ship, how many years of  permanent residence

should be required beÂ­ fore eligibility, how  flexible our deportation  policy ought to be, and  what alternatives one

could consider to the  present Oath of  Allegiance. I look forÂ­ ward to your suggestions

and comments on all  these matters.

DEMOGRAPHIC TRENDS IN  AUSTRALIA

This report was tabled in  the last week of the  parliamentary session,   which means that any  meaningful debate on the

implications of the data  presented was precluded. I object strongly to  numbers depicting populaÂ­ tion growth, the ageing  of the population, and  migrant intakes being

presented in isolation,  without at the same time  looking at policies to  deal with such trends,   without parliamentarians

and the community having  an opportunity to discuss  the long-term implicaÂ­ tions of the kind of data  presented in this report.  We do not seem to be

doing anything which  recognises that governÂ­ ments, to be successful,  must be able to work

according to plans laid  down by far-sighted  precedessors.

For instance, we cannot  presume,  as does this  report,  that if we conÂ­ tinue to take 120,000  migrants each year, we  will have a population of

20 million by the year  2001, because we do not  know what may happen in

our region during the  next few decades. The  approximately 60,000

Indo-Chinese refugees  taken by Australia in the  past came to us as a  result of great political  turmoil. We do not know  that similar experiences  elsewhere in the world  may not place greater

demands on us in the  future. In order to  provide the best possible  service for our migrant  communities, it would be  better if we faced the

fact that Australia will  remain a country which  will welcome a relatively  high migrant intake and  plan accordingly - not

from year to year, but  far-sightedly. We  should not just talk  about the numbers of  migrants and refugees,

but also about long-term  planning of the services  that will be available  and the way in which we  hope to overcome the  problems that will exist

in another 20 years from  now.

DIEA BESIEGED ON 19 APRIL printing is finalised.

The changes in the Migrant  Selection System I  referred to in the last  newsletter resulted in

significant increases in  applications for the  family reunion scheme to  the Department of ImmigraÂ­ tion and Ethnic Affairs.  Long queues were seen at  most regional offices and

the main counter in Sydney  had distributed some 2,000  application forms by lunch

time on the first day of  the new system's  operation.

With unbelievable lack of  foresight, the DIEA had  only 10,000 forms printed  and these were apparently

gone in a day, causing  justifiable anger and  frustration to those who  had waited. Electoral  offices of Members of '   Parliament, to whom forms  had been promised, did  not receive them. My own

Canberra office on that  day received numerous  complaints from electoral  secretaries who were

forced to turn many  anxious constitutents  away. The best we were  able to do was to  pursuade the Department to

issue some photocopied  forms until another

It is a great pity that  having had such fanfare  and such support in the  introduction of this new

scheme, there has been a  breakdown in the  mechanisms to deal with  the people making

inquiries.

The shortage of forms is  not the Department's only  problem at the moment.   Regional offices gained

substantial increases in  workload while at the  same time, in the wake of  the "Razor Gang" recomÂ­ mendations, they have had

a staff cut of almost 5%  (92 positions).  There is  no doubt in my mind that  this will have an adverse  effect on migrant

services generally. This  situation is now exacerÂ­  bated by the extra  demands placed on DIEA

staff since 19 April, beÂ­ cause staff resources are  now being drawn from  other parts of the  Department.  According to  Mr Menadue, Head of the

Department,  this matter  has been discussed with  the Public Service Board,  which has had before it

for some time now a reÂ­ quest for additional  staff. Mr Menadue
