Address to the Foreign Correspondents Association Wednesday, 5 December 2001

Has Australia's international image suffered as a result of the Government's policies towards asylum seekers?

Good afternoon.

My aim today is to provide an overview of the Government's migration program and to mark the place of immigration at the heart of Australia's identity as a compassionate, tolerant, strong and prosperous nation.

I also want to talk about our determination to stamp out people smuggling and to put the record straight on the Government's approach to those trying to enter Australia illegally.

The question you've asked me to address is whether Australia's international image has suffered as a result of the Government's policies towards asylum seekers?

I assume this question is based on reports in news media, both foreign and domestic, attempting to argue that Australia's approach to refugees and asylum seekers is somehow racially based and that Australia is heading down the path of isolationism or xenophobia.

Alternatively, it might be based on a misguided view that Australia no longer wishes to honour its refugees convention obligations - nothing could be further from the truth.

If people outside Australia perceive Australia's reputation to have suffered it is because the issues have not been well reported and I will return to that point later.

Australia's immigration program

Let's look at the facts. Australia has a population of more than 19 million people, of whom one in four were born overseas.

Before the Second World war, Australia had a population of just 7 million. The immigration program that started after the end of the war brought some 5.7 million new settlers to Australia in the half century following.

Today's immigration program has a profound influence on all aspects of our society and continues to make a crucial contribution to building a nation that has been successful economically, socially and internationally.

Australia is one of the few countries in the world to operate a formal, managed migration program. our program does not discriminate on the grounds of race, religion, colour or ethnicity.

It is a program that uses world class, state-of-the-art technology to facilitate entry to Australia while ensuring border integrity is maintained.

There are more than 200 ethnic groups in Australia. They have helped build a vibrant and culturally diverse Australia and through their overseas networks have made us highly competitive in the international market place.

Our migration and temporary entry programs are among the largest, the most orderly and most accessible in the world. our migration selection policies and criteria are transparent and objective.

In 1999-2000, about half of all settler arrivals were from Asia, the Middle East and Africa, while another 28 per cent were from Oceania.

The most rapid growth in the temporary entry categories has been from countries such as China and India with people coming to Australia as students or as business entrants.

Australia's history of immigration - and the very basis of our nation-building - is one of which we are justifiably proud.

Achievements

Let's look in more detail at our migration program.

This year's migration program of 93,000 includes 37,000 in the family stream and 45,500 people in the skill stream.

The skill stream has grown to comprise 54 per cent of the total program and, despite a competitive international environment, skilled and professional workers continue to migrate to Australia.

Ã¢ÂÂÃ¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»

Ã¢ÂÂÃ¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»

In terms of our long term temporary entry programs more than 146,000 student visas Ã¢ÂÂÃ¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»

were granted in the last program year, an increase of 23 per cent.

Students come from more than 150 different countries including China, India, Singapore, Zimbabwe, the US, Malaysia, Indonesia and Hong Kong. recent changes to our migration rules mean that many can now stay after completing their studies - hardly evidence of xenophobia and racism.

Ã¢ÂÂÃ¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»

The working holiday scheme has almost doubled to 75,000 visas annually encompassing people from countries including Japan, Korea, Malta, the Netherlands, Sweden, Norway and Hong Kong.

Ã¢ÂÂÃ¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»

Short term visitors also bring economic benefits. Ã¢ÂÂÃ¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»

More than 3.5 million visitors from around the world arrived in Australia in 2000-2001. in fact, Australia is only one of two western countries to be designated as an approved destination for tourists from China.

Ã¢ÂÂÃ¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»

All Australians have benefited from the permanent migration program. it is estimated that living standards in Australia rose by about $264 per head in 2000-2001 and that migrants will contribute a total net gain to the Commonwealth budget of $1.3 billion over the next four years.

Research shows that a migration program balancing family reunion with skilled entry is good for our society, good for our economy and good for the budget bottom line.

Ã¢ÂÂÃ¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»

The benefits of all these programs are shown on the charts displayed around the room. Ã¢ÂÂÃ¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»

Ã¢ÂÂÃ¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»

Clearly, we remain committed to an ongoing migration program of this type - where is the racism in that? Ã¢ÂÂÃ¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»

Refugee and humanitarian program

While the media largely focuses on Australia's approach to unauthorised arrivals by boat they rarely report the fact that Australia is a very active participant in global refugee settlement.

Ã¢ÂÂÃ¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»

These are the facts

Because we run a migration program that delivers significant economic benefits we can also afford to run one of the most generous humanitarian programs per capita in the world.

Ã¢ÂÂÃ¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»

Ã¢ÂÂÃ¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»

In the last program year under the refugee and humanitarian program, 13,733 people were given visas for Australia. Ã¢ÂÂÃ¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»

In recent years Australia has provided temporary safe haven to people from war-torn Kosovo and East Timor. Ã¢ÂÂÃ¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»

Australia is among the 12 largest donors of financial resources to the UNHCRs core budget, providing $14.3 million in 2001-2002. We have also indicated that an additional $14.3m will also be provided to special programs this year.

Ã¢ÂÂÃ¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»

We are contributing $29 million over four years to address the humanitarian needs of displaced Iraqis and Afghans both in countries of origin as well as in the Middle East and South West Asia.

Ã¢ÂÂÃ¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»

The fact is Australia is one of only ten or so countries in the world that operates a dedicated offshore resettlement program which accepts the world's most needy and desperate refugees.

I invite you to look at our record further.

Australia began resettling refugees back in the 1930s when we took 7000 German Jews. Since the Second World War we have taken 600,000 refugee and humanitarian settlers -about 10 per cent of our total migrant numbers.

However, helping those most in need is one thing. Allowing people smugglers to determine who gains resettlement is another - I will look at this in more detail later.

Last financial year 5,649 people arrived in Australia unlawfully. Of these, 4,141 arrived in 54 boats and the balance arrived by air.

The vast majority of those who arrived by boat were secondary movers - these are refugees who, although they had protection from persecution in one country, have left that protection to seek both a protection and a migration outcome in a second country of their choice, such as Australia.

It is not a forced movement. It is a movement of choice which often involves a deliberate decision to break the laws of many different countries, to use people smugglers and frequently, to bypass other opportunities to seek protection because the goal is to also achieve a destination of choice.

They target Australia for the same reason as legitimate immigrants - for a better life for themselves and their children.

This is an understandable objective but it is not the basis for receiving protection under the UNHCR convention.

In the Australian Government's view, the delivery of resettlement by UNHCR and the

continued capacity of resettlement countries to offer places relies on orderly management of available places.

Places are finite and constitute only a small proportion of the total refugee caseload in the world. Irregular migration is placing a severe strain on resettlement availability and delivery, and on continued community support for resettlement quotas.

Never-the-less, under Australia's resettlement program all refugees who are not secondary movers are provided with a comprehensive range of settlement support services ranging from accommodation and language training to torture and trauma counselling, and welfare benefits.

Our commitment to fight people smuggling is a commitment to preserve our resettlement program. It is a commitment to help support the international protection framework globally and to address refugee issues on the basis of need.

People smuggling

We cannot help everyone but what we must do and - despite the efforts of people smugglers - what we have done for many years, is help those most in need.

What we will not do is to give in to people who advocate open borders and as such support an industry dealing in human misery.

And believe me when I say that it is an industry - a very well organised and executed industry dealing in drugs, prostitution and the illegal movement of people around the globe.

People who advocate open borders advocate that our humanitarian efforts be dictated to by people smugglers - we cannot and I will not let this happen.

I have been to refugee camps in Africa and the Middle East teeming with people who have no option but resettlement.

People who do not have a choice of which country they might like to live in - people who do not enjoy the protection of a safe third country.

These people deserve our compassion, but our ability to help them is threatened by people who have other options.

Failure to address the abuses and misuses of the international protection system will see it unravelling under the strain of ever-increasing cost and flagging community support.

The UNHCR currently spends about 800 million U.S. dollars supporting 21.8 million refugees and people of concern.

Compare this with developed countries which are now spending something like 10 billion U.S. dollars assessing half a million asylum claims in Europe, North America and Australia that will result in only 50,000 people being found to be refugees.

Let me break this down - this means that the UNHCR has just over $37 to spend on each refugee, while developed countries are spending $20,000 processing each person entering

their borders illegally.

Australia is committed to meeting its protection obligations, and we will continue to provide settlement to those whom we assess as in most need.

We also want to see the global focus return to those who are most in need of protection instead of being diverted by people smugglers.

Australia has taken a comprehensive approach to the issues that underpin people smuggling. The attention in the media has largely been on our reception arrangements, but considerable effort is going to all aspects of the strategy.

You will recall I provided the media a paper in early September and again in October which sets out in great detail all the work we have been doing on this strategy.

I have included this paper in the kit you will receive today. Now let me outline briefly this three-pronged strategy.

Prevention

Australia has worked assiduously to counter people smuggling.

We are working with other governments and international organisations towards prevention of the problem by minimising the outflows from countries of origin and secondary outflows from countries of first asylum.

We are also working with other countries to disrupt people smugglers and intercept their customers en-route to their destination.

In origin countries we are working to support a focus on infrastructure development and sustainable returns.

International cooperation, including disruption

To disrupt the work of people smugglers Australia is cooperating with a number of countries including Cambodia, Indonesia, Turkey, Iran, Jordan, Pakistan and Syria.

While this cooperation varies from country to country it can include things like information exchange and training in fraud detection.

The Government strongly believes international cooperation is the key to ensuring the continued function of the international protection framework.

As announced last year the Government seeks reform of the UNHCR and its executive committee to ensure that greater attention is focused on the challenges currently facing the international protection framework.

I have discussed an international approach to the problem of illegal migration during visits to the Middle-East, Asia, Africa and Europe.

Only a few days ago I met with the Indonesian foreign minister and later this week I will be

travelling to the UK, Geneva and Spain, principally to attend the 50 th anniversary celebrations of the UN Convention for Refugees, which will include a reaffirmation of all states parties, including Australia, to the principles of the convention.

During the trip I will be having a number of bilateral meetings, which I expect will include discussions with Dr Ruud Lubbers, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.

Reception, including mandatory detention

Part of the third element of our approach, reception, is a policy of mandatory detention of all unauthorised arrivals while they are identified and any claims to enter and stay in Australia are assessed.

I would like to stress this point - we do not detain asylum seekers. we detain all those who arrive unlawfully whether they seek protection or not. Conversely, we do not detain asylum seekers who arrive lawfully - the majority of the asylum seeker population in Australia at any one time is free in the community.

Our mandatory detention policy for unauthorised arrivals ensures that we can speedily process any claims to remain in Australia and ensure people who have no grounds to remain in Australia remain available for removal once their processing is complete.

We are also able to protect the Australian community from the risks of communicable diseases and people of possible security concern.

Australia's detention centres have proved to be a long-running fascination for the media, including the overseas media, with journalists often complaining that there is lack of external scrutiny of these centres.

Let me take this opportunity to put the record straight.

This year there have been visits by the media to our detention centres at Woomera, Port Hedland, Curtin and Maribyrnong. In previous years there have been visits to Port Hedland and Woomera - in fact there have been visits to Port Hedland ever since it opened.

And it is clear from media reports that detainees regularly contact journalists.

Immigration detention is one of the most closely scrutinised government programs. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission and the Commonwealth Ombudsman regularly visit detention facilities to investigate complaints and conduct their own enquiries.

You will all be aware that HREOC has recently announced yet another enquiry into detention issues.

In February this year I also established the Immigration Detention Advisory Group which provides advice on the appropriateness and adequacy of service accommodation and facilities at the centres.

The Government works hard to protect the people in detention centres providing a range of services including recreation, health and educational facilities.

It seems to me that the media is often blinded by manipulative lobby groups and those people seeking to unwind Australia's detention arrangements.

People in detention are there because they have broken the law.

They are not averse to using the media for their own purposes - this includes making unfounded accusations about conditions and treatment.

It is unfortunate that often these claims are accepted as fact by a compliant media.

We see our detention capacity as critical to ensuring the integrity of our domestic asylum processes. there is increasing Nationality and Identity fraud and increasing global use of unauthorised arrival coupled with protection claims.

These are used as a means to by pass entry controls to let irregular migrants disappear into a community.

Legislation to prevent unauthorised arrivals

You will be well aware of the seven bills recently passed by Parliament aimed at making it more difficult for people to arrive illegally on our shores.

Since that date no unauthorised boat arrival has set foot on the Australian mainland.

The new legislation significantly boosts the fight against people smugglers and strengthens the integrity of Australia's borders.

It will help ensure the effective control and management of our borders and reinforce the sovereign right of Australia to determine who can enter the country and in what manner.

These changes signal both our determination to stamp out people smuggling and our commitment to ensure that people travelling unlawfully to Australia have access to effective procedures to determine their need for protection.

Foreign media coverage

Which brings me back to the specific question I was asked to address - has Australia's International image suffered as a result of the Government's policies towards asylum seekers?

If we have suffered at all it is not as a consequence of anything we have done but as a consequence of what has been reported.

Let me give a few recent examples.

The London Observer ran a story on 25 November claiming that white, middle class Australians were willing to harbour people The Observer claimed were refugees. [ See Illustration ]

Australia does not have a policy of detaining refugees. As I mentioned previously, we do

have a policy of detaining unauthorised arrivals.

Where people are found to be refugees they are immediately released from detention. Those in detention have either not had their status determined, are awaiting removal or are appealing the decision to refuse them protection - it is often those appeals that keep them in detention for extended periods.

The Financial Times said:

Australia needs to rethink its immigration policy…because it prevents the import of skilled workers needed for faster economic growth.[ See Illustration ]

I was stunned when I read this - Australia has allocated 45,500 places in its migration program to skilled migrants this year alone. Australia has had a skilled migration program for many, many years.

An article in the Dutch newspaper Algemeen Dagblad referred to the recent tragic drowning of more than three hundred people, saying the Royal Australian Navy fired over the boat, forcing it to turn back - and then it sank.[ See Illustration ]

The report is not only untrue it's an insult to the Navy and Australia. The vessel sank shortly after its departure from Indonesia and well before it came anywhere near Australia.

The London Independent said the Government rode to victory on a wave of xenophobia. [ See Illustration ]

Let me just make one simple point - how can a country made up of people from over 200 ethnic groups be accused of xenophobia.

In Malaysia, TV3 said Mr Howard won the election on a ticket of anti-Muslim sentiment and paranoia over Muslim refugees. [ See Illustration ]

Again, how can this be so from a country where the immigration program last year took over 5,000 people from Middle-Eastern countries, as well as immigrants from other parts of the world who would also have Muslims among them?

In South Africa, the Business Day said John Howard did not understand that the energy and ambition of migrants often had a positive impact on job creation. [ See Illustration ]

This is an extraordinarily naive accusation against any Australian Prime Minister over the last fifty years given the important emphasis that Australian Governments have placed on migration.

The Frankfurter Allgemeine suggested multiculturalism in Australia was dead. [ See Illustration ]

This is a ridiculous comment when you realise this year's migration program will see 93,000 visas granted to people from all over the world to allow them to live in Australia.

I could go on. there are more examples. But you probably have the point by now, which is

that many overseas media outlets have not checked facts, have misunderstood what they were reporting, and have not attempted to give the other side of the story.

In other words some media representatives have not bothered to contact anyone in my office or my Department or any number of other sources where factual information is available.

I would like to think that from today we will be able to work more cooperatively to ensure your audiences have access to all the facts.

Australia remains at the forefront of immigrant nations and we are an example to others of how to develop and implement a managed migration program which facilitates the entry of people into Australia while at the same time ensuring the integrity of our borders.

I look towards media representatives here today to ensure that you report these facts.
