"Australia has a well deserved reputation internationally  for its contribution to resettlement of Indo-Chinese  refugees in recent years. Further, Australia is well  placed to continue to play an important role in the

future resolution of this problem", the Minister for  Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Mr Stewart West, said  on his arrival back in Sydney today.

Mr West has been overseas since 1 August to view at  first hand refugee problems and to consult with other  major resettlement nations. From 1 August to 4 August,  he represented Australia at an international meeting in  Honolulu of those major resettlement countries. He

then visited Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand  for discussions relating to Indo-Chinese refugees. Whilst in Indonesia, he held discussions with the . Foreign Minister (Dr Mochtar) and other officials and

visited Galang Island refugee camps. In Malaysia he  met with the Acting prime Minister Musa Hatim, visited  Bidong Island refugee camp and had discussions with

officials. In Thailand, the Minister had discussions  with the Prime Minister, General Prem., and. .other  Ministers and officials. He also visited UNHCR-run  camps on the northern Thai-Lao border as well as

Khao-I-Dang.

"The ASEAN countries providing first refuge have  undertaken to do so for as long as resettlement  countries are prepared to continue resettlement".

"These arrangements were agreed to in Geneva in 1979,  following the large outflow of refugees which caused  the countries of first refuge to threaten to refuse entry  to further refugees", Mr West said.

"The major resettlement countries (US, Canada, Australia  and Japan) agreed in Honolulu to continue steady Ã¢ÂÂ    resettlement, whilst attempting to attract other  countries to be more active in resettlement",  Mr West

said.

"The UNHCR, also,  has been encouraged to accept an  expanded role in future policies and strategies to  help resolve the refugee problem. Major resettlement  countries were generally concerned that the scale -

and persistence of the problem was such that measures  other than resettlement needed to be pursued".

Mr West said that he was concerned that resettlement  alone could not provide a complete answer. He had -   taken the opportunity to explore the possibility of  alternative measures in his discussions with ASEAN

countries.

In particular, the measures considered were the  development of the orderly departure program to 'reduce  the incentive for illegal departures from Vietnam, the  development of policies designed to slow the departure  rate through deterrents, and the possibility of  encouraging and facilitating voluntary repatriation.

Mr West said he was reassured by the willingness of  ASEAN, countries to have these matters explored. However, he said the political position and antagonisms  of the countries in the region tendered to rule out Â·;,

negotiation by the parties directly involved. 'Â·

"Australia is a country which recognises the Government  of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam and, with a real  stake in the resolution of the refugee problem, could  initiate discussions designed to develop alternative  measures",  .Mr West said.

"The countries of first refuge acknowledged that Australia  could play a useful role in discussions. Indeed, the  Thai Government has suggested that the discussions with  Vietnam should also include the question of repatriation

of Khmers and Laotians".

Mr West said that the magnitude of the problem in  South East Asia was staggering. There were currently  some 200,000 refugees in camps,  and more than that  congregated along the Thai/Kampuchean border.  The  current rate of resettlement was barely keeping pace  with the rate of outflow and the natural increase in  the camps.

While there was little prospect of voluntary repatriation  to Vietnam, except for particular cases such as  unaccompanied minors,  there was a general view that  for many Kampuchean and Laotians, voluntary repatriation

from country of first refuge was the preferable  solution. Indeed, many of these people did not seek  resettlement. Furthermore,  it is quite possible that  any major increase in resettlement effort might in  itself promote a further outflow.

"While there have been some cases of voluntary  repatriation, these have now stopped. The difficulties  seem to be generally related to political considerations  which disregard the humanitarian concerns for those

displaced people, many of whom have been unable to -   live normal lives for years, some for up to 8 years", Mr West said. -
