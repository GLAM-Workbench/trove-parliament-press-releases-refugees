PHILIPPA TOLLEY: If we could start off with what is probably the issue in the Pacific  region that raises most difficulties at the moment, and that's Fiji. The election date of 2014 is  the one that the interim regime has stuck to for some time. The United States now has come  out and said that look, we'll work with that. How is Australia feeling about that election date?

RICHARD MARLES: I think that we don't accept what's been put forward by the Fiji  regime. Look we want to see Fiji return to a democracy as soon as we can, and a return to the  rule of law, but I think it's very important that Fiji make steps along that road at the earliest  opportunity. 2014 seems to be a long way out there in the future from our point of view. But  more to the point, we're not seeing the kind of expressions that we would like to see about a  genuine return to democracy in Fiji, and I think that's the issue of concern for us.

PHILIPPA TOLLEY: That hasn't changed for some time though you know, 2006 was when  the interim regime took power. There haven't been any signs of movement and all the efforts  on behalf of Australia and New Zealand haven't made any change there. What can you see as  an approach that will see some change and some sort of interaction?

RICHARD MARLES: Ultimately, we do need to see some movement from Fiji but I think  it is very important from the point of view of Australia that we make a statement against the  kind of regime that we're seeing now in Fiji. Perhaps to put it in a more positive way, that we  make a statement in favour of democracy and the rule of law in the region. Of course that's a  statement that the region itself has made, through the Pacific Island Forum, and I think that's  a very important statement. I think what we need to be saying as a region is that we do stand  for democratic government. We do stand for the rule of law, we are opposed to a coup  culture, and that that is not only a statement for all of us within the region but actually in a  way a statement by the region to the rest of the world about how things are done in the  Pacific. Now-

PHILIPPA TOLLEY: That statement has been out there for some time though, there hasn't  been any change and the Commodore has said, look, if you don't work with us maybe we  won't get round to elections in 2014. Isn't it better to say, okay, we'll work with you for 2014  rather than keeping on with something that hasn't resulted in any earlier declaration at this  stage?

RICHARD MARLES: I wouldn't accept the proposition that there's no value in what's in the  stance that's been taken and what's been done. I think it's an important statement for the  region to make of itself and the statement that the region makes to the rest of the world, I  think there is importance in that alone. And I think it is an important thing to say to Fiji as

well, that this is where the region stands. What would be of concern, in our view, is if we saw  any conduct which sought - which could be taken in any way as undermining the position  that the region had. Because I don't think that is going to result in any quicker return to  democracy in Fiji, and I don't think that's going to see any quicker return of the restoration of  human rights in Fiji. So I think it's not to say that, you know... we'd like to see things move  quicker in Fiji, there is no question of that; but it is very important that the stand that we take,  I think, is maintained.

PHILIPPA TOLLEY: Does there need to be any variation though to make sure that the  regime doesn't abandon that date and push things out further?

RICHARD MARLES: When you're talking about variations - let me go back a step. When  you're talking about variations, the question that has to be asked at every point is whether or  not any different course is going to give rise to any quicker return to democracy in Fiji. We're  not convinced that any of the propositions that are put forward in that regard are going to  yield a better result. And what is important is that we do maintain the stance that we've made,  and what is also important is that in whatever behaviour we engage in going forward, that  we're not seen to undermine, or give any comfort to the regime that undermines the statement  we made. It's a very important principle that the region has established, that it stands for  democracy and the rule of law, and I think that there is a great value in maintaining that.

PHILIPPA TOLLEY: You've mentioned the stand of the Pacific Island Forum. The  Commodore has moved to try and maybe divide the unity of the region and to focus more on  the Melanesian spearhead group and that group of Melanesian countries that may be slightly  more sympathetic to Fiji's point of view. We've had one major meeting where the  Chairmanship was going to be handed to Fiji, has been abandoned. Next week we now have  another summit, a special summit going to be held in the Solomons. Has Australia had  diplomatic input with its allies in the region?

RICHARD MARLES: On this trip, we've been to three Melanesian countries within the  region. The... what we understand from each of those countries is a - and sorry, they're  Vanuatu, the Solomon Islands and PNG - what we understand from each of those countries is  that they are anxious about what they're seeing in Fiji, that they share our concern that there  isn't any real movement in Fiji towards a return to democracy. The.. in fact if anything, there  have been some concerning developments in the last month or so which would seem to  indicate Fiji moving in a worse direction.

PHILIPPA TOLLEY: Which ones are you talking about?

RICHARD MARLES: In terms of Chaudhry, in terms of the developments with the Fiji  Times. Both of those don't give us a sense of confidence that this is a regime which is  seriously engaging in a move down a path towards an active electoral politics at some point  in the near future. They seem to be actions which in fact are not about electoral politics at all.  And the implications they have for human rights are a concern. Now I think the concern we  have is shared by the countries that we met. And of course they have a sense of wanting to  see a return of Fiji to the fold and to be honest that sentiment is shared by everyone, and it is

shared by Australia. But they understand that for Fiji to return to the fold in circumstances  other than a restoration of democracy would have profoundly negative effects for our region.

PHILIPPA TOLLEY: I understand though that there were meetings between these leaders  in New York when the.. last month, when the General Assembly was on, and the plan is to  hold a reconciliation ceremony and to discuss giving the Chairmanship of the MSG to Fiji.  Which will be giving exactly that message.

RICHARD MARLES: Well let's see how it all plays out. But I can only say what has been  said to us, and there is a definite concern on the part of each of the countries with whom we  met about the situation in Fiji. And I don't... There is no sense that we're picking up, that there  is any sense of being relaxed about the circumstances in Fiji. There is an enormous amount of  concern throughout Melanesia.

PHILIPPA TOLLEY: From some of those Melanesian countries.

RICHARD MARLES: Absolutely

PHILIPPA TOLLEY: They would then see though the sentiment has been expressed that  it's better to work with Fiji than to put them on the outside. Would Australia be concerned if  for example the Chairmanship of the MSG was handed to Fiji?

RICHARD MARLES: Ultimately that's of course a matter for the MSG, and I don't think  that I want to venture an opinion on.. I don't want to be telling the MSG what it should or  shouldn't do. But we would be.. the stance that the Forum has taken in relation to Fiji, I think,  is a really important statement for the region and I think it's important that the integrity of that  stance is maintained.

PHILIPPA TOLLEY: If the MSG does go forward and say the Chairmanship is given to  Fiji, would you think that'd be giving succour to Fiji and the Commodore's attempt to maybe  sideline the Forum and possibly divide the region, have a Melanesian/Polynesian split  developing?

RICHARD MARLES: It's very important that we maintain a unity within the Forum, and  that's probably the simplest way to answer that question. I absolutely think it's important that  we maintain the unity that we had around the position which we had in the Forum. All the  conversations and discussions that we've had in the last week suggest to me that the unity  we've had within the Forum, that we can be confident in expecting it to continue.

PHILIPPA TOLLEY:You don't think there's any threat to that?

RICHARD MARLES: No. What we're hearing from the Melanesian countries is one of  support for the position that we've maintained within the Forum. Now you know, what the  MSG does is ultimately a matter for the MSG, Australia is not a part of it, and we don't seek  to influence it, but we think that the important regional statement that has been made is that  which has been made by the Forum; and I can only say that in the conversations that I'd had  with those Melanesian countries which we had during the last week, there is support for the  position at the Forum.

PHILIPPA TOLLEY: In your tour around these various nations, what is the feedback  you've been getting about Australia's involvement in the region. Do people feel it's too much,  too heavy handed as a metropolitan power? Not enough? - for example your Prime Minister

wasn't at the Forum despite holding the Chairmanship.

RICHARD MARLES: I think there is an enormous amount of goodwill towards Australia  and New Zealand within the region. We were in Samoa for example, and the feeling of  goodwill in that country towards both Australia and New Zealand, and for that matter of  course the rest of the region about the contributions that we've made in the restoration of that

country after its really devastating tsunami is overwhelming. There is a deep affection, I  think. And I reckon that that characterises the relationship more than any other sense. And I  don't mean just with Samoa but throughout the region. With Papua New Guinea I think there  is a deep affection between Papua New Guineans and Australians and New Zealanders, as I

think there is in reverse. So I do think there is a very strong foundation in the relationship that  is had between Australia and the Pacific Island countries. And for what it's worth I would  make that observation in relation to New Zealand as well.

PHILIPPA TOLLEY: There has been criticism in the past though about Australia's  attention on the region, and maybe at times the focus has not been there, it's been seen more  important to focus on Asia and the rest. How significant is it and how much attention needs to  be put on what indeed is the backyard?

RICHARD MARLES: I think you characterise that exactly right in terms of it being our  neighbourhood. We will see trade deals done around the world, we'll see various conflicts in  the world, we'll see powers emerge and others fall. Whatever we see in the rest of the world  and however that goes, this will always be our neighbourhood. And that is one thing which

will be always constant in our relations going forward. And for that reason the Pacific is  fundamentally important to Australia's national interests and to our foreign relations. It's why  I was so keen to get out on a trip within the Pacific as soon as possible having been appointed  to this role - and of course as soon as possible having seen the formation of the Gillard  Government.

PHILIPPA TOLLEY: So will you be advocating the new government changes in any way  its interaction with the region?

RICHARD MARLES: I actually think that in terms of the significance of the region within  Government and foreign policy thinking, I think the significance is there. I guess where I  would agree in part with what you're saying is that I do think that the significance of the  region within the Australian public debate, within the media and within the community, its  profile certainly needs to be raised. For me that is a really important objective in my time in  this role - to try and raise the public consciousness within Australia of the significance of the

region to our foreign affairs and to our national interest.

PHILIPPA TOLLEY: And aid? That's going to remain on a steady course?

RICHARD MARLES: Yes. It will, and of course we have committed to... are committing  .5% of GDP to aid by 2015. That's going to see a really significant increase in the amount of  aid over the next few years. Over the next 4 to 5 years, roughly speaking, we're going to see  the Australian global aid budget almost double. Inevitably, one would imagine, that is going  to mean an increase within the Pacific. Although of course, the specifics of that will be a

matter for bilateral negotiations between our partners in the Pacific and one which is based on  need. But aid certainly has a significant role to play. Now in saying that I think it's also really  important that we have a sophisticated and intelligent approach to our aid, so that we're  absolutely getting the best bang for our buck within the region and so that there is a sense of  satisfaction I guess on the part of receiving countries about the use that aid is being put to  within their country. It will remain a very important part of our relationship. We're hoping to  hone it, improve it and have it give rise to a greater impact.

PHILIPPA TOLLEY:You were just talking about aid before we had that pause then.  Whatever the amount that's going in there, the criticism often is that it becomes boomerang  aid. You put in consultants, you pay your own people to be there, and then it comes back, and  when it comes away, actually not much has gone with the country and it's not always been  that successful. You talked about tinkering; are you going to look at refocusing? New  Zealand has changed its aid focus, there's some work to be done with what New Zealand's  chosen to fund and now, what Australia funds...

RICHARD MARLES: It's a very good question that you ask. You'd be aware that there was  a joint review by both PNG and Australia of the Development Cooperation Treaty with PNG  which of course is the largest recipient of aid within the region, and really one of the two big  recipients of aid that we provide. One of the conclusions that came out of that review was  related to the point that you've made, and the amount of technical assistance and the amount  of technical advisors, the proportion of that in terms of the total overall budget to the country.  And we are having a review of that issue specifically in relation to PNG. That review is in the  process of being completed but what I expect would come out of that is a decrease in the  amount of technical assistance that we provide as a proportion to the overall budget - and  therefore of course a reduction in the amount of technical advisors. It would be important to  say however, in making that point, that I do think that there is a place for technical advice and  technical assistance. To take PNG as the example, actually Australian technical advice - not  just Australian technical advice but technical advice funded by the Australian aid programme  - is in high demand from a range of those ministries. So often it's the request coming from  the PNG side. But particularly as they go into the LNG project which is such a big thing for  that country, they are looking for technical assistance in the lead-up to the implementation of  that project. And so it's going to be important to provide that through aid.

PHILIPPA TOLLEY: So that specifically quite technical project aside though, if you're  changing it away from technical help, from consultant support, where is the money going to  go? Into the Government, into grassroots, how are you going to refocus that?

RICHARD MARLES: If you look at the review that was done in relation to PNG there was  a view that the aid that we're providing PNG should be more focused. In other words at the  moment that to put in the negative way, that it's being spread too thin. In general terms that's  a proposition that we think has some validity. Again, the Government, both governments  actually are in the process of having a joint response to that review. So we are minded to be  thinking about how we can have our aid focused on some particular areas. Education is  obviously a key. For example in PNG, there are certain service delivery aid projects that

we've had, for example the provision of textbooks in relation to education which have had  some really positive outcomes. And I think, looking at those programmes that have been  successful and building upon them is a pretty important principle.

PHILIPPA TOLLEY: -quite a pragmatic approach -

RICHARD MARLES: I just think that it's an important principle to have regarding our aid  now. Obviously I'm talking about the situation in PNG and there is more work to go in  finalising our response to that review. But I think it was actually a really good exercise, I  think in drawing some lessons more generally about the way in which aid is provided in the

region.

PHILIPPA TOLLEY: Just finally, when it comes to immigration we've had the Pacific  Solution, that's been rode back on, obviously your current Prime Minister has approached  East Timor looking at some options. Are you likely to go back to Pacific countries again and  ask them to become involved in dealing with the problem of asylum seekers?

RICHARD MARLES: Our focus is on East Timor, is the short answer to that question.  We've made it clear that this is a large regional problem, that it needs a regional solution.  That we want a solution which does have the involvement of the UN and a solution which  involves a country which is a signatory to the Refugee Convention. Of course I understand  there are countries in the Pacific who are signatories to that convention as well, but East  Timor is where our effort's focused, and we are working with them quite closely. There is  obviously water to go under the bridge in terms of whether or not East Timor ultimately  agrees to having the processing centre there, but that's where the focus is at.
