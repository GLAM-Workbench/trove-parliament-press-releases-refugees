STATEMENT ON LYNCH COMMITTEE AND ITS IMPACT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SECURITY

The Minister for Social Security said today" that the

Government decisions arising from the Lynch Committee would

strengthen and streamline the administration of the Department of

Social Security. The Minister particularly drew attention to the

fact that the review did not affect payments to individuals and

subsidies to welfare services through the Department of Social

Security. This indicates the Government's concern that the review

should streamline administration. It was not aimed at individuals

but at the processes of government. The decisions had also been

carefully designed to avoid any adverse impact on areas which

service pension and benefit programs.

Several of the decisions of the Review arose from proposals

actually put forward by the Department and complemented the

strong views already held towards on-going reviews of management

to achieve improved efficiency. The decisions affecting the

Department of Social Security are:

. Handling of unemployment benefit claims is to be

streamlined by transferring the processing of forms

to Social Security from the Commonwealth Employment

Service.

. The various consultative and advisory committee

arrangements within the Department have been reviewed

and a number of changes will be put into effect

immediately. These changes are outlined in detail

below under the heading "New Consultative Committee

Arrangements for the Department of Social Security".

. The rate of expansion of regional offices by the

Department will be reduced and co-location arrangements

with the Commonwealth Employment Service will be extended.

ÃÂ±  pilot program of selective entitlement reviews, focussed

on clearly identified areas where thp risk of abuse is

greatest, will be undertaken. .

The Government has agreed that allowance payments made to

individuals under the Adult Migrant and Refugee Education

Program be transferred to the Department of Social

Security with the proviso that there be sufficient lead

time given for the development of a suitable computer based

system.

Certain internal operations of the Department are to be

reviewed with a view to streamlining them. These include

the Department's area management arrangements and its productivity

control system, which is used to measure work loads and assess

manpower requirements.

The Department is reviewing; in consultation with the Public

Service Board, the scope for streamlining administrative

arrangements relating to payment of pensions overseas.

There is also to be a review of the activities of the

Department's social work services and of functions of the

Social Welfare Division.

The operations of the Office of the Commissioner for

Employees'  Compensation are to be expanded in the ACT

and extended to the States, to take over the work done

in this area by other Government departments and authorities.

The Commissioner for Employees Compensation is responsible

for cases of compensation of Commonwealth Government

employees.

The Government has also decided to remove the option available

to Commonwealth Government employees to make compensation

appeals to the State Courts as well as to the Commonwealth

Employees Compensation Tribunal (CECT). The CECT jurisdiction

will be transferred to'a separate division of the Administrative

Appeals Tribunal.

"I am sure that the changes that have an effect on the Department

of Social Security will ensure more efficient provision of

services to the Department's clients", Senator Chaney said.

NEW CONSULTATIVE COMMITTEE ARRANGEMENTS

FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SECURITY

The Government has reviewed the various consultative and advisory

committee arrangements within the Department of Social Security

and a number of changes have been made.

While the number of committees has been reduced, there has been

a strong emphasis on streamlining committee operations and on

creating a closer link with the welfare community.

The new structure will ensure:

- a stronger link between the State Consultative

Committees on Social Welfare and the National Consultative

Council on Social Welfare; ,and

- strengthened contact between the committees and

the political and administrative levels of Government.

Senator Chaney said "I have been concerned at the difficulty in

maintaining a dialogue with the large number of consultative

groups which had been established. The new structure should

make-this easier".

Membership of all committees is being reviewed in light of the

Government's decisions -

(i) The Women's Welfare Issues Consultative Committee

will be abolished and its functions will be

incorporated into the National Consultative

Council on Social Welfare

(ii) Likewise, the Homeless Persons Advisory Committees will

be abolished as will the Australian Capital Territory and

No'rthdriv Territory Sub-Committees on Children' s Services.

The functions will be absorbed into the Consultative Committee

on Social Welfare that exist in each State and Territory.

Senator Chaney said "These changes will begin to be put into effect

immediately and will be finalised by 30 June -1981". Details of the

new National Consultative Council on Social Welfare and i ts.State

Committees are as follows:

NATIONAL CONSULTATIVE COUNCIL ON SOCIAL WELFARE

A 16 member National Consultative Council on Social Welfare will

take the place of the present Council and the Women's Welfare

Issues Consultative Committee. It will encompass the broad

field of social welfare and provide a stronger link with the

State and Territory Committees.

Membership will be reviewed to reflect the fields of health/

welfare, economics and the law, and special interest groups such

as women, disabled people, Aboriginals," ethnic communities, the

young and the aged. State and Territory Chairmen will continue .

to be full members and four national co-ordinating bodies

(Australian Council of Social Service, Australian Council on the

Ageing, Australian Council for Rehabilitation of Â·  Disabled and

the Australian Early Childhood Association) will be asked to provide

panels of names for the Minister's consideration.

Membership will be geographically distributed between States

and Territories to reflect the interests of those in remote areas,

the country and the cities.

It is envisaged that the Council will have certain sub-groups which

will facilitate its business. These may include an Executive

Committee, a Standing Committee of State and Territory Chairmen,

a Standing Committee on Women's issues and ad hoc Committees

created to report on specific issues.

STATE AND TERRITORY CONSULTATIVE COMMITTEES ON SOCIAL WELFARE.

The eight State and Territory Committees will be reviewed to

strengthen their role as links with the welfare community, the

National Consultative Council on Social Welfare, and the State

Offices of the Department. Most importantly, new Terms of Reference

for these Committees will give equal weight to examination of

service delivery issues and the consideration of major policy

concerns.

The Committees will comprise seven members and be restructured.

to incorporate members who can advise on the Homeless Persons

Program. In the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern

Territory, a member with children's services expertise will be

included to enable the work of the former Children's Services

Sub-Committee to be Continued.
