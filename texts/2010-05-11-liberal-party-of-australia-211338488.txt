Joe Hockey, MP  Shadow Treasurer



INTERVIEW WITH ABC PM - TUESDAY 11 MAY, 2010

11th May 2010

E&OE……………………….…………………………………………………………………

PRESENTER:

Is this a responsible Budget?

JOE HOCKEY:

Well, Kevin Rudd and Wayne Swan are asking Australians to trust them - to trust them that there will  be the biggest improvement in terms of trade in 60 years, to trust them that there will be a massive  increase in investment in mining despite a new $9 billion a year tax.

Now, the logic of the Budget is flawed because they’re saying that fewer people are going to smoke  with higher taxes on tobacco, but there’s going to be a massive increase in investment in mining with  a massive increase in taxes on mining.  It is illogical.  It took Wayne Swan 25 minutes to get the word  out ‘deficit’, $40 billion deficit this year, the Government is going to have to borrow $711 million a  week to pay for their deficits, they will never deliver a surplus…

PRESENTER:

Well they say they’re delivering a surplus in three years.  Could you do any better?

JOE HOCKEY:

They’ve never delivered a surplus, they never will deliver a surplus.

PRESENTER:

Never?

JOE HOCKEY:

They’re trying to claim credit for a surplus they have never delivered and they’re hoping to deliver in  three years’ time.



PRESENTER:

Is that because you’ll block the resource rent tax?

JOE HOCKEY:

We are totally opposed to a tax that puts a ball and chain around our fastest athlete.  You do not speed  up the field by handicapping your fastest athlete - what you do is you kill the goose that is laying the  golden egg.  It was the mining sector that helped to get us through the last downturn and now they  want to harm the mining sector during what could be the growth phase going forward.

PRESENTER:

You’ve already said you are going to oppose two of the government’s savings measures - one is the  resources tax the other is the private health insurance rebate.  Can you go to an election promising to  get the deficit down more quickly and would you have to implement [inaudible] spending cuts to do  that?

JOE HOCKEY:

Well, the expenditure is reckless.  Today Wayne Swan announced I think an extra 23 GP super  clinics.  Well, of the 36 they’ve already promised, only two are fully operational.

PRESENTER:

So you’re happy to see that promise go by the wayside?

JOE HOCKEY:

So they’re going and making more promises…we will make announcements about this in the not-too-distant future.  The skills training is simply a re-badge of existing programmes.  It is not new money.

PRESENTER:

So on the one hand you’re saying it’s not new money and on the other hand you’re saying it’s risky  spending.  I mean, which is it?

JOE HOCKEY:

No, I’m not saying that, I’m pointing out the flaws in the Budget.  They’re spending more than $1  billion addressing the problem of asylum seekers, they’re spending nearly $1 billion fixing the  problem of the pink batts.  Kevin Rudd promised that there would be no new bureaucracy for his  national health plan and he’s allocating $500 million to a new health bureaucracy.  The Government  can’t be believed on anything other than their commitment to spend a lot of money.

PRESENTER:

Can you, though, get the deficit down quicker, bring the Budget back into surplus quicker?

JOE HOCKEY:

Well, we’re going to have to because these guys haven’t got the courage to deliver real outcomes.   They’re lacking in courage, they’re lacking in ticker.  I’m confused tonight about whether they are  going ahead with an ETS or not.  I mean, they were committed - the greatest moral, social, economic  challenge of our time a few weeks ago, then they dumped the ETS, now they’re trying to rebirth it but  they don’t want to put it in the Budget.

PRESENTER:

Is there a political problem for you in this Budget - that the Treasurer says there’s not a lot of money  left in the kitty for election spending? Are you going to have to go to an election campaign with no  frills or low frills as well?

JOE HOCKEY:

Well, their Budget of getting back to a $1 billion surplus in three years assumes that they are not  going to make one single new major spending initiative between now and 2014.  Do you believe that?  I mean we’re going to have to take the hard decisions on savings measures, of course we are.

PRESENTER:

Now Joe Hockey, apparently you have to go to your next engagement but just one very quick  question.  You say that this Labor Government will never bring a Budget down that’s in surplus.   When would you do it?

JOE HOCKEY:

Well, when we deliver a surplus which we would want to be faster than when Labor would ever  deliver a surplus, we will deliver a real surplus not one based on false assumptions.

PRESENTER:

Joe Hockey, thanks very much for joining us.
