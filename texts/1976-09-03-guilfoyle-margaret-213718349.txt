(  Â£Â° BACKGROUND STATEMENT BY THE MINISTER FOR SOCIAL SECURITY, .  — "SENATOR MARGARET GUILFPYLE, ON GUARDIANSHIP OF TIMORESE CHILDREN The Minister for Social Security, Senator Margaret Guilfoyle,   said today that the issue of legal guardianship of some  Timorese children who arrived in Australia in August 1975 was

a complex matter and was receiving very careful consideration.

Senator Guilfoyle said that, after their arrival, it was  discovered that some of the children were not accompanied by  parents or legal guardians.

"They had arrived in Australia in the care of other Timorese  who had assumed responsibility for them," Senator Guilfoyle  said. |  .

"The legal position in Australia is that when such children  do not have resident status and lack a legal guardian, it is  possible for State welfare authorities to become responsible  for them under appropriate State legislation.

"On 28 May,, the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Mr Mackellar, announced that the Timorese refugees (including  unaccompanied children) could apply for resident status. Most of them did and now, in order to protect the welfare

of the unaccompanied children, my Department and the  Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs are counselling  them on the grant of resident status.

"When they become residents, the provisions of the Immigration  (Guardianship of Children) Act will apply to them, and I, as  Minister of State responsible, would become their legal  guardian. Then the principal child welfare officer of the

State in which they were resident would exercise guardianship  on my behalf as I have delegated my responsibilities under  this Act to those officers.

"Should the occasion- arise, the return of these children to  relatives in Timor would be considered. At the present time  they are not available for adoption and the costs of their  maintenance are being met by the Department of Social Security",

Senator Guilfoyle said.
