SKILLED AND FAMILY FAVOURED

Australia’s new migrant selection system will strongly  'favour skilled applicants and those with family in  'Australia, the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic  Affairs,  Mr Tan Macphee,  said today.

Mr Macphee gave the House of Representatives details of  new selection categories and criteria, following a  wide-ranging review of the previous system.

The new system will start from 19 April 1982.

f  .

i F i ve selection categories will cover the range of   applicants for permanent entry:

.  Family Reunion has been replaced by an extended Family Migration category;

.  General Eligibility has been abolished and two new i  categories introduced - the Labour Shortage and ‘  Business Migration category and the Independent Migration category;

.  .  the Special Eligibility category has been modified;

.  a separate category for Refugees and Special Humanitarian programs remains.

"The Government has revised the selection system so as to   meet two objectives - to reunite close family members and   to help satisfy Australia's demand for skilled workers," Mr Macphee said.  "At the same time,  we are retaining the   principles of a universal, non-discriminatory policy.

MIGRANT SELECTION SYSTEM MEDIA KIT (1-2)

"Apart from pepple with close family ties in Australia,  applications generally will not be accepted from people  whose occupations are not in demand.

"Self reliance is taken to be the key to the settlement  success of applicants for permanent residence.

"Within the Family Migration category, successful  applicants can be expected to attain self reliance quickly  with the assured support of relatives who have already  settled successfully.

"Within the Labour Shortage and Business Migration  category, successful applicants can be expected to attain  self reliance quickly using the skills and personal  qualities which are in demand and of benefit to Australia."

To allow for bigger proportions0 of skilled, business and  family migration within the immigration program, the  former General Eligibility category has been abolished.

Most applicants will now have to answer "Yes" to one of  two questions:

.  .  Have I close family ties with an Australian resident who can help me settle? OR

.  Have I a skill or personal quality that will benefit Australia?

"I want to make it clear that the skills and qualities we  will be seeking are those which are in demand in  Australia," Mr Macphee said.

"Family Migration will attract important concessions.

"The number of bonus points available for sponsorship has  been increased over NUMAS in the new Economic/Employment  Assessment.

"The period of residence required of sponsors has been  reduced in some cases.

"This does justice to the reasonable expectations of manyÂ·  thousands of Australian residents who themselves are  successful migrants.

.  "In return for these concessions the Government expects  that sponsors will accept greater responsibility in  helping their relatives settle."’  .

Mr Macphee said the effects of the new svstem would not be  felt until 1982-83. .  '

THE MAIN CHANGES

.  Numerical assessment will be confined to "economic/employment factors. Assessment of settlement  aspects will not be numerically weighted.

.Â· Greater labour-market emphasis will curtail migration of unskilled and semi-skilled migrants.

.:  The General Eligibility Category has been  abolished. Apart from people with close family ties in  Australia applications generally will not be accepted  from people whose occupations are not in demand.

.  There will be important concessions for family , migration in return for sponsors here in Austtralia  helping in settlement.

.  All working age parents (irrespective of the number  of children in Australia) will be treated equally under  the same sponsorship provisions and will not be subject to  Economic/Employment Assessment; their sponsors will have

to provide financial assistance and accommodation and  pre-arrange employment if the applicant is likely to enter  the work force.  Previously some working age parents were  subject to detailed assessment.

.  Non-dependent children and brother and sisters, previously classified as General Eligibility migrants,   will now be classified as Family migrants.  They will gain  concessions in return for their sponsors assuming greater  obligations.

.  Residence qualifications for sponsors have been reduced in some cases.

MEDIA KIT (2-2)

.  People with creative or sporting talents likely to improve the quality of life in Australia will be admitted  in small numbers;  previously they may have been refused  when failing to meet strict occupational demand criteria.

.  Weight will now be given to an applicant's ability to learn English.  In addition a language-related factor  (Ability to Communicate in proposed employment) will be  dropped from.the new Economic/Employment Assessment.

.  Sponsorship will be required, for all family  migration and sponsors will have to meet firm obligations  to gain concessions for some family members. The new  provisions overtake existing sponsorship schemes.

.  Assurances of Support will ’ 'eplaca maintenance guarantees and there will be tighter checks on sponsors'  capacity to meet their obligatios before a sponsorship  proceeds.

.  Fiance(e) provisions will be tightened. .  At present,  fiances are admitted as permanent residents. To  prevent abuse by people who do not marry after arrival;  fiance(e)s will now be admitted as temporary entrants and  granted permanent residence after marriage. .

.  Some"points will be given to people intending to settle in designated growth areas to be identified in  consultation between the Commonwealth and States.

.  An Independent Migration Category has been introduced to ensure that the emphasis on family migration  and labour-demand migration does not prevent the entry of  other people of obvious benefit to Australia. Numbers to  qualify under this category will be small.  .

FAMILY MIGRATION EMPHASIS

The new migrant selection system would facilitate the  reunion of family members by emphasising the closeness of  family ties, the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic  Affairs, Mr Ian Macphee, said today.

Close relatives would be admitted at the expense of  independent applicants previously admitted under general  eligibility criteria.

Residence qualifications for sponsors had been reduced in  some cases.

But all family migration would require sponsorship and  sponsors would have to demonstrate that they could meet  their obligations.

Family Migration would attract important concessions:

. there would be no age limits for children who are  part of a family unit;

. non-dependent children and brothers and sisters -previously included in the General Eligibility  category - have now been included in the Family  Migration Category. They will gain bonus points if

sponsors provided financial support and  accommodation and arranged employment in advance.

.  all working age parents (irrespective of the number of children in Australia) will not be required to  undergo Economic/Employment Assessment. Where they  intend entering the work force, accommodation,  financial support and a firm job offer will bfe  required; .  '  .

.. an applicant's ability to learn English will be given weight. In addition the other language  related factor (Ability to communicate in proposed  employment) will be dropped.

. Â·  bonus points for sponsorships would be increased, in recognition of the importance of family support.

"The cumulative effect of such concessions ensures that  much greater priority will be given to family reunion,"  Mr Macphee said.

"This does justiceio the reasonable expectations of many  thousands of Australian residents who are themselves  successful migrants.

"For all the acknowledged hurdles that new arrivals have  to overcome, the successes greatly outnumber the failures.

"Above all, immigration has changed Australia for the  better. Migrants seeking a better life, have made  Australia a better place to live."

LABOUR-MARKET EMPHASIS

"Australia's new migrant selection system will be more Ã¢ÂÂ  sensitive to current and foreseeable demands for labour,  the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Mr Ian Macphee, said today.

"Labour Shortage and Business Migration will comprise  applicants with occupations in demand in Australia,  employment nominees, business migrants and other  applicants who can provide assurance of excellent  settlement prospects.

"People admitted under this category will have skills or  characteristics of direct benefit to Australia. I want to  make it clear that the skills and qualities we will be  seeking are in demand in Australia.

"They are in scarce supply and we will be competing for  them with other technologically-advanced countries.

"Through the Employment Nomination Scheme we will continue  to encourage employers to look overseas when the skills  they need to maintain the momentum of their industry are  not available here or cannot be obtained through training.

"But employers will have to show they have made genuine  efforts to recruit locally - we will not be bringing  people here only to compete with Australians for scarce  jobs.

"The new system abolishes the General Eligibility  category, previously a source of many semi-skilled and  unskilled migrants. In future, apart from people with  close family ties in Australia, Â«applications generally  Will not be accepted from people whose occupations are not

in?demand in A u s t r a l i a Ã¢ÂÂ - -  .

TRANSITIONAL ARRANGEMENTS

The new migrant selection system will take effect from  19 April next year, the Minister for Immigration and  Ethnic Affairs, Mr Macphee,  said today.

The lead-time would allow for field testing of selection  criteria before numerical weightings were distribution to  selection factors.

It would also allow time for prospective applicants and  sponsors to clearly understand the new requirements.

"Prom tomorrow, further nominations under existing family  migration arrangements will only be accepted for the close  relatives in the new Family Migration category.

"The Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs will be  making the system widely known in Australia and overseas.

"Despite the new concessions, the numbers of people  wanting to come to Australia will continue to exceed the  numbers who will qualify for entry.

"I hope that news of a new system will not raise false  hopes among people who have been disappointed in the past,  whether as applicants or sponsors."
