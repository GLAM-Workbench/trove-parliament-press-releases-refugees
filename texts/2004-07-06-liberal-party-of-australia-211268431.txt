Media Centre  Afghan refugees arriving in Australia from Nauru

VPS 97/2004

A second group of refugees from the 146 Afghan refugees on Nauru will arrive in Australia  this evening.

Minister for Immigration, Senator Amanda Vanstone, said this group of arrivals brings to 70  the number of Afghan refugees resettled in Australia, following the Government's  commitment late last year to reassess the entire Afghan caseload on Nauru, in light of  updated information from the UNHCR about changed circumstances in Afghanistan.

'Of the 146 people reassessed by Australia to be in need of refugee protection, there are 55  children, 70 men and 2 1  women,' the Senator Vanstone said.

'The arrival of this group follows the arrival of 35 Afghan refugees from Nauru on the 29th of  June.

'In the second group of 35 arriving this evening, there are 15 children, 13 men and seven  women.

'They will be resettled in Sydney, Melbourne, regional Victoria, Adelaide, and the ACT. A  number of the arrivals have family members already residing in Australia.

'All of the refugees arriving this evening have been granted secondary movement visas. 18  refugees were granted five-year visas, the remaining 17 were granted three-year visas.

'These visas are available to people who have abandoned or by-passed effective protection in  a country of first asylum and travelled to another country to seek a preferred migration  option.

'Departmental officers are working with the remaining 76 Afghan refugees in the Australian  caseload on Nauru and it is expected most will be resettled to Australia in the coming weeks,'  Minister Vanstone said.

'Arrangements are being finalised to bring most of the remaining refugees to Australia,  possibly by charter flight in the week commencing 12 July.'
