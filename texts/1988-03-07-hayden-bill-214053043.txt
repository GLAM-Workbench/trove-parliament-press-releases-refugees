Aid for UN program  for re tu rn e e s in S ri Lanka

Australia would contribute $200 000 to a United Nations High Commissioner  for Refugees (UNHCR) Special Program of assistance for returnees in Sri  Lanka, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Mr Bill Hayden, M.P.,  announced today.

Under the guidance of the UNHCR, the program expects to assist the  voluntary return of 75 000 Sri Lankan Tamils from India and also the  resettlement of 5 000 displaced families in Sri Lanka in 1988.

The conflict in Sri Lanka has left hundreds of thousands of displaced people  from various ethnic origins and religions. It is estimated that there are  430 000 displaced people including 350 000 in the Jaffna district in Sri  Lanka. A further 135 000 Sri Lankan Tamils are currently living in India.

Mr Hayden said Australia's contribution would be used to establish transit  centres, provide for registration and medical screening, and for the issue of  relief packages of household kits and food supplies.

Australia’s support of the UN program for returnees in Sri Lanka forms part  of the Government's humanitarian aid program managed by the Australian  International Development Assistance Bureau (AIDAB).
