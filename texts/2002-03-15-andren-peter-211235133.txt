Telephone Survey Answer Found

The recent telephone poll of the Calare electorate was conducted by members of Swindbourne University looking into his re-election in 2001, according to Peter Andren, Member for Calare.

“The purpose of the survey was to find out the major issues that influenced the way people in Calare voted,” Mr Andren said.

“The information gathered will be used as part of a research paper into the Australian electorate and attitudes to asylum seekers.

“The survey has now been completed and the researchers apologise to the people of Calare for any inconvenience that it might have caused,” Mr Andren added.
