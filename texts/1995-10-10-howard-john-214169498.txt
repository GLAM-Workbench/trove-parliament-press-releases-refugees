JOURNALIST:

Mr Howard the Prime Minister has tried to equate the Liberal, the Coalition with the Republicans  in the States and the fact that the Pope wasn't willing to speak with them.

HOWARD:

I think Australians will be very disturbed that the Prime Minister has sought to involve His Holiness  in a political debate in Australia. It's desperate and most Australians will see it as quite  contemptible.

JOURNALIST:

He's hitting new lows is he?

HOWARD:

It is contemptible to try and involve His Holiness in domestic political debate in Australia. Most  Australians will be appalled at the Prime Minister's latest lurch into the politics o f desperation.

JOURNALIST:

Is there an equation between the Coalition and what the Republicans are doing? Is the Coalition  trying to push the workers down?

HOWARD:

The only political movement in Australia that has pushed the workers down is the Australian Labor  Party led by Paul Keating and this little exercise of trying to involve His Holiness will be rejected as  contemptible by Australians right across the spectrum.

JOURNALIST:

Do you think it will anger Catholics?

HOWARD:

It will anger all Australians and I can understand that. His Holiness should not be dragged in on  one side or other o f Australian politics. I think it is disrespectful and I think it will be seen as  contemptible by most Australians.
