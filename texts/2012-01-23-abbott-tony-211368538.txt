22 January 2012

TRANSCRIPT OF THE HON. TONY ABBOTT MHR   DOORSTOP INTERVIEW  FORESTVILLE, SYDNEY

Subjects: Prime Minister’s betrayal, Craig Thomson, poker machine reform, border protection

E&OE……………………….……………………………………………………………

TONY ABBOTT:

Yesterday, issues of trust for this Prime Minister just got worse and worse. This is a Prime Minister who  betrayed Kevin Rudd over the Prime Ministership, she betrayed the Australian people over the carbon tax.  Now, she’s betrayed Andrew Wilkie and everyone who supports him over pokies. Andrew Wilkie is not just  anyone. He is the person who gave this Prime Minister the keys to the Lodge and now he has been betrayed  by the person who he helped and this wasn’t just any old agreement. It was more like a contract than an  agreement. It was about as solemn a document as could be arrived at in our Parliament and now it’s been  torn up by this Prime Minister. Now if Kevin Rudd couldn’t trust her, if the Australian people couldn’t trust  her, if Andrew Wilkie couldn’t trust her, no-one ever again can or should trust this Prime Minister. No-one  can ever take anything this Prime Minister says seriously again.

Now the other point I want to make is that with Andrew Wilkie gone, the Prime Minister’s parliamentary  majority rests entirely on Craig Thomson. Now Craig Thomson is a man who is under numerous serious  investigations including criminal investigations in two states. One of these very serious investigations - the  Fair Work Australia investigation, has been going on for fully three years. Now this is a tainted Government  and a tainted Prime Minister, because her parliamentary position rests on a tainted Member of Parliament  and I call on the Prime Minister to say, does she have full confidence in Fair Work Australia’s investigation  of Craig Thomson as she claims to have full confidence in Craig Thomson himself?

QUESTION:

Do you have full confidence in the Fair Work Australia investigation?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well we know that very early on in this investigation, there was direct contact between the Prime Minister’s  office and Fair Work Australia. I think the Prime Minister has got to come clean and say exactly what  additional contact there has been between her office and Fair Work Australia. It’s very difficult to have  confidence in the integrity of our institutions, when an organisation like Fair Work Australia takes three  years to investigate a Member of Parliament who is absolutely critical to the future of the Prime Minister.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, do you support the Greens’ push for $1 maximum bets legislation that they’re going to introduce  into Parliament?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well look, any question about supporting the Greens is a question for the Prime Minister. The Greens are  her alliance partners in Government. Bob Brown is effectively the Deputy Prime Minister of our country and  really, if the Greens are looking for support, they should look to the Labor Party, they should look to the  Prime Minister.

QUESTION:

[inaudible] merits of the $1 maximum bets, what do you make of it?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, I just think this is a matter for the Greens to sort out with this Prime Minister. This Prime Minister has  made Bob Brown effectively the Deputy Prime Minister of our country and any question about supporting  the Greens really has got to be directed to the Prime Minister.

QUESTION:

[inaudible]

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, the interesting thing about these boats is that they are Indonesian flagged boats, Indonesian crewed  boats containing people who have been resident in Indonesia. So, if they have no business in Australia, then  they should be in Indonesia.

QUESTION:

So you will turn back the boats?

TONY ABBOTT:

It’s been our absolutely consistent position all along that to stop the boats, you need to do three things: first  you need to re-open Nauru, second you need to reintroduce Temporary Protection Visas and third, you need  to be prepared to turn boats around where it is safe to do so. Now, the former Government did it, the current  Government promised that it would be done, but I’m afraid that Prime Minister Rudd and Prime Minister  Gillard lacked the guts to do what they ought to know is necessary to protect our borders. Now, I want to  make this further point, I am a friend of Indonesia. I regard the relationship between Australia and Indonesia  as absolutely vital for the future of our two countries. That relationship has been trashed because Kevin  Rudd and Julia Gillard have been more interested in the Geneva relationship than they have been in the  Jakarta relationship.

QUESTION:

Will you be seeking Mr Wilkie’s help to call an early election?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look I respect Andrew Wilkie. I get along well with Andrew Wilkie. I don’t always agree with Andrew  Wilkie and let’s wait and see what happens in the Parliament when the Parliament comes back in a couple of  weeks time, but the fundamental point I make is that now that Andrew Wilkie is gone, this Government is

critically dependent upon the vote of one man and that man is Craig Thomson. It’s a tainted Government,  because it now relies on the vote of a tainted Member.

QUESTION:

[inaudible]

TONY ABBOTT:

I have lots of conversations with lots of Members of Parliament including independent Members of  Parliament and I just don’t comment on when they take place and what’s discussed.

QUESTION:

What is your position on some of the detail of Gillard’s plan - the one year trial, the $250...?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, this Prime Minister is making plans, making commitments one day, then tearing them up, changing  them and breaking them the next day. I think it’s very hard to take seriously anything that this Prime  Minister says. Let’s not forget that her agreement with Andrew Wilkie, wasn’t just any old agreement, it was  more like a contract than an agreement. It was drawn up as a legal document, rather than just a letter  between two politicians and if she hasn’t honoured that, why should anyone take her seriously on this?

QUESTION:

On the question of the boats, what measures will the Coalition Government take to enable this to happen -  will you have more ships? Will you buy more ships? Will you divert more ships? Will you setup a coast  guard or what?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, with Labor, which originally promised to setup a coast guard, what we’ve had is more of a coast guide  than a coast guard. What we’ve had from the Labor Party is the Australian Navy deployed to our northern  waters, essentially to find people smuggler vessels and bring them to Australia. Well, I think it’s more  important for the Navy to be in our northern waters to return people smugglers vessels to the country from  which they’ve come.

QUESTION:

What about the question. Are you going to take - what measures will you introduce to enable that to  happen? More ships?

TONY ABBOTT:

Obviously, in the end, as a government should we win the next election, we would consult with our  professional advisers. We would consult with senior Naval officers. So the fundamental point I make is that  the Navy has done it before, they can do it again. The Navy has the professionalism and the expertise to do  this, provided the Government has the strength of character and the determination to give us the appropriate  order.

QUESTION:

[inaudible] but is it your view that you will be a strong government and make them do [inaudible]?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, I know that professional military officers and men - they do their duty and their duty is to carry out  the orders that they’re given by the Government of the day.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, how likely is it that Navy personnel will be put at risk in terms of their safety turning boats  around?

TONY ABBOTT:

The best thing we can do to save lives on the open seas is to stop the boats and if we want to save life,  Indonesian life, Australian life, the life of people from other countries who are trying to get into Australia  via the back door - the best thing we can do to save lives at sea is to stop the boats and if we want to stop the  boats, we’ve got to be serious about turning them around where that can be done.

QUESTION:

What’s your position on Temporary Protection Visas (inaudible)?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think it’s very important that Temporary Protection Visas be reintroduced and this Government could  reintroduce them at the stroke of a pen, just as this Government should as we speak, be reopening the centre  at Nauru. They said they were going to do it before Christmas. If they had been serious, the centre at Nauru  could have been up and running before the Parliament goes back.

QUESTION:

The negotiations between Mr Morrison and Mr Bowen towards coming up with some sort of a deal…

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, as far as this Coalition is concerned, we have had a consistent position - a consistent position for  more than a decade. If you want to stop the boats, you need to reopen Nauru, reintroduce Temporary  Protection Visas and be prepared to turn boats around where you can. Now, we don’t do weak deals with  bad governments. We just don’t do that. We say what we think ought to be done and if people do what we  think is the right thing, we give them every support. If not, well I’m afraid they’re on their own.

QUESTION:

What’s the feeling that you’ve got in terms of TPVs? There’s a suggestion that you might actually make it  more difficult for [inaudible] to in terms of getting permanent residents and if so what support will be behind  that?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, as all of you would know, the problem with the influx of boat people is that basically that’s meant that  people who come in the back door, have been displacing people who are waiting to come in the front door.  Now, that is very, very unfair to people who want to do the right thing by Australia and that’s why it’s  important that we change the rules to try to ensure that people who do the right thing are not being  disadvantaged because of people who do the wrong thing.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, what do you make of the role of independents in the Federal Parliament given Andrew Wilkie  couldn’t really pull off what he set to achieve?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, in the end, the problem is the hung Parliament and a fundamentally dishonest Prime Minister. That’s  the problem that we’ve got and I think the Australian people more and more have come to the conclusion  that minority Government is an experiment that’s failed, that at least with this particular Government, a hung  Parliament produces dishonest Government and that’s why what we need now is not more deals, what we  need now is an opportunity for the people to decide what should happen to our country through an election.

QUESTION:

Are you moving for a no-confidence motion in Parliament?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well let’s wait and see what happens when the Parliament comes back, but the point I make is that in the  end, I think what the public of Australia want is not further parliamentary manoeuvring, what they want is a  new election so that they can sort out who are the fit and proper people to lead our country in these difficult  times. This is a very difficult year ahead. The international economic situation could hardly be more fragile.  This is a Government which time and time again, has demonstrated that it can’t be trusted with taxpayer’s  money, that it can’t be trusted to spend money competently and prudently. I think under these circumstances  it’s very important that the public have their chance to say who they trust with their future.

QUESTION:

How do you expect the Indonesians will react to your policy of towing back the boats and have you had any  discussions or has anyone from the Coalition had discussions with Indonesia about this already?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well again I make the point that people from the Coalition have good relations with the Indonesian Embassy  here in Canberra. We have good relations with the Indonesian Government in Jakarta. There are lots of  communications between members of the Coalition and the Indonesian Government. I don’t talk about them.  We have them when we need to have them, but the last thing I’m going to do is talk about the timing and the  content of discussions between Coalition people and the Indonesian Government. That’s why we are in so  much trouble, because the current Government is incapable of proper diplomacy. The current Government  can’t have a conversation with a foreign government without blabbing about it on national television.

QUESTION:

Would you…

TONY ABBOTT:

Final question thanks.

QUESTION:

Just one thing. Is it going to be your expectation that if you come to power that you will be able to turn back  most boats?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I just make the point that these are Indonesian flagged boats, with Indonesian crews on Indonesian  ports, with people who have been resident in Indonesia and if these boats have no place in Australia, they do  have a place in Indonesia.

Thanks very much.
