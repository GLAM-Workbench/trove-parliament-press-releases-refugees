SOCIAL SECURITY

The 1982-83 Budget is somewhat more generous to pensioners,   beneficiaries and low income earners than the past six Fraser  Budgets. However,  a close examination discloses that though there  is something for everyone, the benefits and concessions are spread

thinly,  and there are absolutely no guarantees that the increases  and concessions given in this Budget will not soon be overtaken  by rises in the cost of living.

Leaving aside its recently acquired housing responsibilities, social  security spending will increase this year to $11,471 million, and  will represent 28.2% of total budget outlays.

The major part of the increase is taken up by automatic six-monthly  indexation (which merely allows pensioners to catch up with past  cost of living increases) and by an enormous rise in unemployment  beneficiaries caused by the economic recession.

PENSIONS

The new. pension rates from 1 November 1982 will be $77.25 a week  for single pensioners and $128.80 for a pensioner couple.

The standard pension rate which was 24.5% of average weekly  earnings in 1975 is at present only 21.9. % of average weekly earnings.  When the pension is adjusted in November, it will still reach only  22% of average weekly earnings, a real decline in its value.

Free Area .  .

The pension 1  free area'  limits have been increased for the first time  since 1972. They have gone from $20 to $30 a week for a.single  pensioner and from $34.50 to $50 a week for a pensioner couple. This goes nowhere near redressing its reduction in real terms, and  because there are no proposals to index the free area limits beyond

$30 and $50, their value will decline further. Moreover, the $10  1  free area1  increase is so small that it will provide little work  incentive which is important to all pensioners.

Fringe Benefits

The increases in fringe benefit levels from $40 a week to $56 for  a single pensioner and from $68 to $90 for a married couple are  equally welcome. However, because there are no indexation  provisions for these limits, the system remains administratively  difficult.  Pensioners will be granted fringe benefits only to

find them cancelled because there has been a cost of living increase  to superannuation or a higher interest rate on money invested.

The withdrawal of the pensioner health card in those circumstances  creates uncertainty and panic, and often real income losses as  other fringe benefits disappear. The $2 charge for pharmaceuticals  to pensioners without health cards will probably cause even more  administrative problems and resentment.

Pensioners and Tax

From 1 November 1982 tax threshold will be increased from $4,195 to  $4,595 and pensioners will receive a pension rebate of $250 a year.  This will ensure that pensioners with small investment incomes or  bank interest of below $16 a week in 1982-83 will not pay tax.

. . 2 . .

- 2-

Â£>

This is just over half the free area of $30 a week,  so that in  this financial year many pensioners receiving the full pension will  still be paying tax.

It should also be noticed that as the new tax threshold applies for  only two-thirds of the coming year, the pensioner rebate will be  only $167 (not $250) in 1982-83.

There are no sweeping proposals as there were in the last Budget to  tighten legislation against pensioners with assets. Senator Chaney  has now withdrawn all threats to pensioners' cheque accounts. Many pensioners however are anxious about the Government's announced  policy to introduce from 1 January 1983 a general tax on all cheque

(or like) payment instruments. The details are uncertain until  the legislation is introduced.

Supplementary Assistance

Supplementary (rent) assistance, paid only to the poorest pensioners -  those with almost no other income and paying rent in the private market-  will rise on 1 November 1982 from $8 to $10 a week.

This $2 increase which will cost $24 million in a full year (only  $16.7m. in 1982-83) is a derisory amount compared with the new  harid-outs to home owners.

Last year 451,000 pensioners received supplementary assistance, of  whom 267,000 did not own their own home and had no income apart from  their pensions. While they are given a mere $2 a week extra, rentals  at the bottom end of the market are rising at an annual rate of more

than $10 a week.

It should have been increased to at least $15 a week if it were to take  account of current rent levels.

A further glaring discrimination is the refusal to pay supplementary  assistance to unemployed people paying rent. They face the  same costs as pensioners in private rental accommodation,  but are  given no rent relief either by the Department of Social Security or  State housing authorities.

All long-term unemployment beneficiaries (eg, over 12 weeks) should be  receiving supplementary assistance on the same terms and at the same  rates as other pensioners.

UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFICIARIES

Over 18 without dependants

Unemployment benefits will be raised from 1 November 1982 from $58.10  a week to $64.40 a week, taking it to half the rate of an unemployed  pensioner couple ($128.80).

This item of relative generosity has been forced on the Department by  the absurd effect of their previous policy of having the single rate  so far below half the married rate that it paid single people to  claim de facto relationships so that they could take advantage of  both the higher rate and the six-monthly indexation rises. The

Government has given no guarantees that it will index this amount so  that in May 1983 it will revert to the same ridiculous situation.

- 3-

The November increase for the unemployed without dependants will still  be $12.85 a week below the single pension rate - and they fall still,  further behind when pensioners receive a May increase and they do not.

16-17 year old unemployed

For the. first time in 7 years the unemployment benefit for the under-  18 unemployed has been increased, but by only a paltry $4 - from  $36 to $40 a week - which will in a very short time be swallowed up  by inflation, including new sales taxes.  It can fairly be called

insulting.

It still represents a figure $37.25 a week below, the single pension  rate and less than half the poverty line.

There is no recognition that many young people must live away from  home for family reasons, or to look for work. Nothing in this Budget  explains how a 16 or 17 year old is expected to live on just over  $5 a day.

For them, a living-away-from-home supplement to take their unemployment  benefit up to the over-18 single rate is a matter of necessity.

Income limits for unemployment, beneficiaries

These have been increased from $3 a week for the under 18s and $6 a  week for the over 18 unemployed to a standard $10. a week. They  would now be $20 if they had been indexed since their last rise in  1969. Between $10 and $60 their benefit is reduced on a 50% basis

and after $60 is earned, they lose $1 for each $1, earned.

There is still an. unwarranted discimination between pensioners and  unemployed beneficiaries, with the free areas, for pensioners rising  (from $20 to $30 a week), more than for the unemployed (from $3 and  $6 to $10 a week).

It costs the Government very little to increase the unemployment  benefit 1  free area1.  This small increase is another grudging and  inadequate concession- to the hard-pressed unemployed...

Taxation of spouse and childrens' allowances for the unemployed

No pensioners pay tax on spouse and childrens' allowances, but the  unemployed are taxed on those allowances. If they have more than  three children, they are taxed only because they are paid  additional amounts for children., .  .

It is a petty and outrageous discrimination and pressure should be  brought on the Government to remove it.  .

Unemployment benefit, pay-out

In the past, six years on only one occasion has the Government overÂ­ estimated its annual payment on unemployment benefits. It has  generally under-estimated by over $100 million.

There has undoubtedly been an under-estimate for 1982-83 which has  stated that $1,567 million will be spent on unemployment benefits.   The average number of beneficiaries over the year is estimated to  be 395,000.

. Â·. 4 Â· Â·

- 4-

Yet, in July 1982, the first month of the 1982-83 financial year,   the number of unemployment beneficiaries went over 400,000 - to  405,000. This is 91,000 higher than the July 1981 figure of  313,700.

The numbers on unemployment benefit have risen steadily since last  November with the past six months showing the highest ever recorded  totals of beneficiaries. With the gloomy economic outlook,  unemployment is expected to keep on climbing in the foreseeable future,

and increases in the rates of benefit have been announced.

In these circumstances, it seems that the Government has under- .   estimated the pay-out by as much as $300 million and the real  figure may be closer to $1,870 million.

This is undoubtedly a repeat of the usual confidence trick of  pretending that the deficit is lower than the true figures and then  claiming to be taken by surprise when unemployment goes higher and  higher.

No access to fringe benefits;

The Government will grant neither supplementary assistance nor fringe  benefits to the unemployed. '

They have only the health care card under the Disadvantaged Persons  Health Care System. This now entitles them, in addition to free  medical care and hospital care in standard wards $2 for each  prescription instead of $4.

When one considers their below-poverty line incomes and other  discrimination, it is a particular meanness to prevent the  unemployed having a pensioner health benefit card on the same terms  as pensioners. .

The Commonwealth gives them no other fringe benefits and only some  States give a few concessions to the unemployed. Generally, when it  comes to concessions for hearing aids, rates, transport, motor  registration, fuel bills and so on, the unemployed are non-persons.

PAYMENTS FOR CHILDREN

Family Allowances:

This is the only increase in family allowances for the first two  children since August 1976. It will apply from 1 November 1982 (though  the 1981 increases did not come into force until 1 January 1982) .

It raises the payments for dependent children by 50% - raising the  monthly payment for the first child from $15.20 to $22.80 and for  the second child from $21.70 to $32.55.

These will help the 74% of families who received nothing in the last  Budget which gave increases only where there were three children or  more.  .

Neither the 1981 nor 1982 increases restore the real value of the 1976  family allowances, as is. evidenced from the following table:-

5 30.35 45.55 45.55 54.00 Ã¢ÂÂ  8.45

Thus, a family with five children loses $33.20 a month (or $398.40 a year)  because of the Government's failure to index family allowances...

The total expenditure shortfall in family allowances in 1982-83, compared  with their indexation, is $396 million. .

The Prime Minister called family allowances 1  the single most important  reform in the Australian welfare system since taxation'  when he  introduced them. Since then, he has allowed that reform to wither away  so that real assistance for children has actually fallen since 1975-76.

Family Income Supplement .

From May 1983 a tax-free Family Income Supplement (FIS) will be  payable for low income families, apart from pensioners and beneficiaries,  at up to $10 per week for each dependant child.

This provision at last gives special recognition to the needs of low  income families in the workforce - a policy which the ALP has been  advocating for some years. Previously, it was possible for a low  income family with several children to receive less in wages than it  would on benefit, taking into account the additional assistance payable

to beneficiaries with children. Many families experienced acute  poverty as a result. Their situation will now be considerably improved.

Unfortunately, the Government has chosen to extend assistance in a  restrictive a manner as possible. The maximum FIS payment of $10 per  week per child will be reduced by 50 cents for each $1 of income in  excess of the limit for a disadvantaged persons health care card:

this will be Only $184 per week in November. Hence eligibility will  be exhausted at the following incomes: .

By contrast, average weekly earnings for males stood at $330 a week in  June 1982, and will be even higher when the scheme is introduced in  May 19 8 3.. -Only 5% of full-time male employees currently earn less  than about $220 a week. Of course female earnings are lower., but most

female family heads tend to receive sole parent's benefit.

- 6-

The confisticatory rate at which Family Income Supplement is withdrawn  with higher incomes will thus severly restrict the number of families  who benefit from it. As one illustration of this, the estimated  full-year cost ($30M.)  is only lh% of the cost of extending a similar  benefit to all potentially eligible families if it were free of any

income test.

A further problem with the restrictive FIS income test is that it leaves little scope for low income families to improve their positions. A wife taking part-time or casual work,  for example,  could find that each dollar she earns reduces FIS by 50 cents and reduces her

husband's spouse rebate by 25 cents. The net gain of 25 cents may not even compensate for the. costs of travelling to work, childcare, and the like.

Another reason for the apparently low cost of the FIS is the  likelihood that many poor families will not apply for the benefit -  whether through lack of. knowledge or fear of bureaucratic intrusiveness.  Only a FIS which extends more widely, with more liberal income limits,   will generate the broad support necessary to encourage the fullest  possible take-up. .

Allowances for pensioners' children

The Fraser Government has ignored the advice of the National  Consultative Council on Social Welfare, which recommended that the  allowances for children of pensioners and beneficiaries should be  indexed.  It has given no increase at all in 1982-83.

It has given only one increase since it came to Government ($2.50 a week  in November 1980). If its value had been indexed.from the 1975 level  of $7.50 a week, it would now be $14.10 a week, that is, $4.10 a week  higher.  .  '  Ã¢ÂÂ

The Fraser Government.is this year saving $130 million at the  expense of 246,000 pensioner and unemployed families caring for 445,000  children. .  .

It is another example in this Budget of the poorest families getting  the least.  .  .

Handicapped Children's Allowance

The Handicapped Children's Allowance, introduced in 1975 by the Labor  Government, will be increased from $73 a month to $85 a month.  There  was no increase last year, and this increase is about $5 a month less  than it would have been with indexation.

Orphan's Pension .

This pension is paid on behalf of just over 4,000 children. It was  last raised to $5,5.70 a month in November 1980.

The Government has given.them no increase again this year, though there  has been a 21% increase in the CPI in the past two years which should have  taken the payment to $68 per month for each orphan child. It is a  very small outlay and as the cost of caring for orphan children in

institutions is enormous,  the Government is very short-sighted in  deciding to freeze this payment.  .

SERVICES

Children's Services

There.has been some welcome improvement in the allocation for children's  services in 1982-83. Although the block grant to States for pre-sChbols  has been frozen at $33 million for several years,  funds for children's  services have increased to $70 million.

The future directions in spending follow closely the recommendations of  the Spender Report.  As he recommended:- .

.  $5 million will be made available for high priority needs for new services;

.  increased expenditure will go to family day care services  which are considered a more economical use of children's  services funds; and

.  $200,000 will fund a pilot scheme to subsidise children in commercial child care centres.

A new fee rebating system for economically needy users to be known as  the Special Economic Need Subsidy will be introduced,  and Supplementary  Services Grants will be made to assist children with particular  development and cultural needs.

Child care organisations are totally opposed to funds, going to commercial  centres as they see a real danger of funds increasingly going to  profit-making centres Which generally have lower quality child care,  while only the poorest parents will be able to have their children ih

Government-subsidised community child care centres. :  .

Family Support Services ,

Family support services money appears to have been frozen at last  year's levels and unless the Government can be persuaded to release  more funds, valuable community services will fold up. it underlines  the problems Of leaving community support organisations at the mercy

of the child care budget instead of it being part of ah integrated  community development program. .

Youth Services Scheme

Additional funds of $500,000 are being made available for the youth  services scheme - which basically covers emergency accommodation -  to absorb increased costs in 1982-83, pending its final evaluation.  This will presumably take into account the report of the Senate

Standing Committee on Homeless Youth which includes a recommendation  that more flexible housing policies be implemented to provide suitable  medium to long-term accommodation. .

AID TO DISABLED PEOPLE '  '  Ã¢ÂÂ   Â·

Grants to eligible organisations for capital and current costs under  the Handicapped Persons Assistance Act will rise from $61.8 million  in 1981-82 to $74.1 million in 1982-83.

There have also been a number of changes in direct payments to  individuals which will result in marginal improvements to their  income position. These measures include a $10 increase in the  '.free area'; a rise of $2 in the incentive allowance; the granting

- 8-

of health care cards (because it's cheaper than giving pensioner  health cards) for 12 months to invalid persons venturing into the  workforce; the introduction of a standardised Rehabilitation  Allowance with invalid pension rates and conditions for all

rehabilitees, and the bringing of pensioners in activity therapy  and training programs into line with employees in sheltered workshops.

Mobility Allowance

The Government's main initiative in respect of disabled people is  the mobility allowance which will not be introduced until April 1983  and so will cost less than $5 million in 1982-83.

It is expected to cost $18.2 million in a full year and this will be a  payment of $10 a week to people who are not only unable to use public  transport, but also working or training for 23 hours a week. Recipients forfeit their sales tax exemption on a new car. It  remains to be seen how many disabled people will actually benefit from

the Mobility Allowance, which,  incidentally, was not high on their own  priority list. Ã¢ÂÂ   .

Independent living/self help .

The only direct contribution to the cause of independent living and  self help, is the $100,000 funding for a pilot study for attendant  care. There is no specific funding for the self help movement as such.

The Program of Aids for Disabled People (PADP) received a total  allocation of $3.6 million (including $469,000 for administration)  compared with a total of $2.1 million in 1981-82. Since the PADP  scheme was established 2 years ago, it has been plagued with problems  arising from inadequate financing.  It appears that nothing is going  to change this year.

AGED PERSONS HOUSING

The allocation for aged housing under the Aged or Disabled Persons  Homes Act and the Aged or Disabled Persons Hostels Act has had.a  nominal increase to $83 million in 1982-83. It is very close in real  terms to allocations of previous years (e.g. $55 million in 1978-79;

$62 million in 1979-80). ,  .

The Government has given up its unsuccessful programs which promised  building programs of $225 million in 3 years, which were never  achieved, and has reverted to a more realistic yearly allocation.  It  remains: to be seen whether in this way they will be better able to  spend their Budget allocation.

HOMELESS PERSONS ASSISTANCE

In 1982-83 the Government will be into the second year of the three-  year homeless persons program announced at the time of the 1980  elections. Â·

The allocation of $4.1 million includes a $3 million capital funding  program for homeless persons, with special provision for young people,  to assist in meeting crisis accommodation needs.

There is obviously some problem in overlap of objectives and provision  of facilities between this program and the Youth Services Program  funded by the Office of Child Care.  .

. .9 . .

OTHER SERVICES FOR THE AGED

The personal care subsidy which helps meet costs associated with  special attention for the frail aged in hostels, has been increased  from $20 to $30 a week, a rise well overdue.  (Estimated $35 million  in 1982-83) .

The subsidy for meals on wheels under the Delivered Meals Subsidy  Act has risen 10 cents to 50 cents for an ordinary meal and  5'5 cents for one with a Vitamin C supplement (Estimate $5.6 million  in 1982-83). .

Payments under the States Grants (Home Care) Act will rise for .senior  citizens'centres if matched by States on a $2: $1 basis , and for welfare  officers and home care services if matched by the States on a  $ 1:$ 1 basis, (Estimate: $24.6 million).

EMERGENCY RELIEF

This has again, as in the previous two Budgets, been frozen at  $500,00.0. This is in spite of overwhelming evidence that more than  double the number of poor people are seeking help at times of  crisis, while the voluntary agencies have fewer resources with which

to help them.

Because this Budget has given little help to the poorest pensioners and  beneficiaries who are the most frequent .clients of aid agencies, the  need for emergency relief is unlikely to diminish. Â·

The Labor Party has made a firm commitment to .increase the emergency  relief allocation by $2 million.

ADMINISTRATION '  .

There will be an estimated staff increase in the Department of Social  Seucrity of 1,052 in 1982-83, bringing up the average employment  figures in the Department to 13,027, The additional appropriation for  salaries in 1982-83 is $14.8 million.

oOo

VETERANS'  AFFAIRS

Vietnam veterans have been ignored and older ex-service organisations  placated in the Budget,  in line with Senator Messner1s recent statements  warning that the general veterans'  community should not suffer  because of over-concentration on the claims .of Vietnam veterans.

Nevertheless, some measures advocated by the ALP in federal Parliament  have been adopted.

The .100% disability pension for pulmonary tuberculosis sufferers will be  restored to those veterans getting it before 2 November 1978 and the  service pension will be extended to Commonwealth and Allied ex-merchant  mariners from February next year, thus rectifying glaring inequities

that have been subject to vigorous lobbying.

The disability pension will be disregarded in applying the income test  for the service pension and fringe benefits,  while repatriation benefits

1 A

- 10-

will be extended to World War II veterans currently getting not less  than 50% disability allowance plus a service pension.

Benefits will also be extended to members of designated peacekeeping  or monitoring forces serving before November last year, who were not  previously covered.

The maximum funeral benefit will go up from $400 to $500, with an  easing of eligibility criteria.  .

The measures announced only touch the surface of veterans' needs. No relief is in sight for the wives of TPIs; there is no easing of  eligiblity provisions for Defence Service Homes; no proposals are  advanced to reduce delays in the hearings of appeals,and there is no

intention to extend benefits to allied ex-servicemen or to provide  equality of treatment for Australian veterans of all wars, all of  which were put forward and adopted as ALP policy at the recent  National Conference.

HEALTH (material supplied by Dr. Neal Blewett, Shadow Minister for Health)

Pharmaceutical Benefit Changes

1. The patient contribution for pharmaceutical presciptions will be raised from the present $3.20 per item to $4 per item on 1 January 1983. Â·

(a) This represents a rise of 25%; .  >

(b) It follows too a rise of 16% in the patient contribution  in the 1981 Budget; and

(c) In the 8 years of the Fraser Government the patient  contribution will have been raised from $1.50 to $4, a rise of 167% - nearly twice the rate of inflation in  that period.

This rise is a classic example of the user pay principle making the  sick pay for their medication. It will pose considerable strains on .   families with sick children,  on people requiring multiple prescriptions,   and on people requiring regular medication for chronic conditions.

2. A two tiered system of subsidy has been developed to mitigate the impact  of this patient contribution.

(a) All holders of pensioner health benefit cards and health  benefit card holders and their dependants will continue  to receive their prescriptions free of change. .

The numbers of such holders will be somewhat increased as  a result of raising the fringe benefit levels from $40  a week for single pensioners and $68 a week for a couple,  to $54 a week and $90 a week respectively.

(b) All other social security pensioners,  sickness beneficiaries  and veteran pensioners who do not hold a pensioner health  benefit card or health benefit card and all health care card  holders and their dependants will only be required to pay

$2 for each prescription item, i.e. a concessional .   deduction of $2 per item.

The basic unfairness of this concessional scheme relates to  health care card holders (many of them unemployment  beneficiaries).  All the income requirements for the . .11. .

- 11-

pensioner health benefit card it is unfair to treat  their recipients differently for pharmaceutical benefits.   In addition the introduction of a concessional tier  makes the system more complex and cumbersome.

HOSPITAL FUNDING

Health grants to the States for public hospitals,  community health  services and school dental services are now separated from the  health budget, but they are still identifiable.

1982-83 marks the second stage of the new hospital funding arrangements.   Last year, Commonwealth funding allowed for the States recovering only  60% of the Commonwealth's assessment of their capacity to raise  additional hospital revenue. This year the States will have to raise  the full 100% of the assessed capacity to raise additional hospital  revenue.  This year the States will have to raise the full 100%  of the assessed capacity to raise additional hospital revenue. This  means a massive cut in hospital funding for the States. (See table below).

Queensland is the State most severely penalised because of its continuing  free hospital system, while Tasmania and South Australia, where Labor  Governments made long term agreements with the Whitlam Government,  seem best protected. .

HOUSING .  .

(material supplied by Tom Ureh,  Labor Spokesman on Urban and Regional Affairs)

The 1982-83 budget fails to provide the housing sector with the  stability it requires to achieve ah adequate supply of housing  to meet social needs,  contribute to employment growth and assist  economic recovery. Housing inequalities will be widened. Housing finance will be dearer and more volatile. Rents will

rise. Housing insecurity will increase.

The tighter money supply target for 1982-83, and the open-ended  provision of home loan interest rebates,  signal a further lift  in housing interest rates Within a shift to further deregulation  of the financial system.

Home loan interest rebates

The home loan interest rebates for first home buyers announced  in March 1982, and the rebates announced in the budget, are   1 O

-3 2-

estimated to cost in a full year $415m. We cannot be confident  that this estimated loss to revenue is accurately costed. i  have grave concerns about the equity and effectiveness of the  rebates.  Any person buying a home to live in can obtain a rebate  of 30 cents in the dollar on their interest payments over a rate  of 10 per cent on loans up to $60,000, no matter what their income  or the source of the loan. The rebates will give a handout to  many who do not need assistance at the expense of taxpayers in'

general. The rebates will encourage the growth of fringe lending  institutions charging exorbitant interest rates to people desperate  for a home who have been rejected by banks and building societies.  Many people will be put at risk. The finance companies and  usurers will profit. The housing finance sector will be

destabilised. .  Â·

Pensioners and unemployed families paying off a mortgage, but  not paying tax, are ineligible for the rebate.  As they do not  pay rent,  they will not receive supplementary assistance. They  get nothing. .

Home ownership access

In the context of high and rising interest rates, the rebates will .   not provide sufficient security to home buyers and will not, by Â· . themselves, expand access to home ownership. The grants of V

$2,500 to $3,500 provided through the $147m. allocated for the Deposit;  Assistance Scheme will not meaningfully reduce the deposit gap .  > of over $25,000 faced by first home seekers. There is no  guarantee of additional housing funds. The $300m. released .  ;

from Statutory Reserve Deposits>  and the $400m. requested from  banks themselves, may not be forthcoming, and there is no ‘

condition that the funds be provided at affordable interest ;

rates. .  :

Public housing .

With volatility in the private sector, falling home construction  levels and under-used capacity in the housing industry, the  public sector should be playing a more active, stabilising role -  especially at a time of massive neglect of low-income housing

needs.  Commonwealth net advances in constant prices for housing  in the states and territories in 1982-83 are less than one third  the amount provided in 1974-75.

The cumulative real reduction in public housing funds over that eight  year period is a staggering $3,740 million. Maintenance of  public housing funds at 1974-75 levels would have meant an  additional 75,000 dwellings. There would not now be 100,000
