Two groups of boat people reported off north-west Customs Coastwatch this afternoon reported two groups of boat people in isolated locations off north-west Australia, the Minister for Justice and Customs, Senator Amanda Vanstone, said today.

At ASHMORE ISLANDS, about 18 people were sighted on land during a scheduled Coastwatch Dash-8 surveillance flight.

A traditional Indonesian motorised vessel was also sighted on a nearby beach.

Coastwatch has tasked the NavyÃÂ­s HMAS Ipswich, which is patrolling in the area, to interview the people.

At CHRISTMAS ISLAND, an Indonesian motorised vessel with an estimated 30 people on board has been sighted a few kilometres offshore.

Reports say that the vessel is unlikely to reach shore for some hours because of high seas.

The vessel was sighted by an Australian trading vessel, which was in the area. The information was then relayed to the Australian Federal Police at Christmas Island and in turn to Coastwatch.

Arrangements to transfer the people to the mainland will be made in conjunction with the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs.
