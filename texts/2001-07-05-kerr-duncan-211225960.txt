Marriages Of True Minds? - Trends Of Resistance And Consistency In Administrative Law Reform Duncan Kerr - Shadow Minister for Justice and Customs

Address - Australian Institute Of Administrative Law Forum, Canberra - 5 July 2001

Check Against Delivery

I would like to thank the Australian Institute of Administrative Law for inviting me to speak at this conference. It is always a pleasure to participate in fora of this kind, which facilitate informed and constructive debate across disciplinary, professional and public-private sectorial divides. Arguably such debate is especially important in relation to questions of administrative law reform, as this area of law, perhaps more than any other, cuts across those divides in practical and powerful ways.

In my recent book Elect the Ambassador! Building Democracy in a Globalised World, I detail and analyse some of the dramatic social and economic changes experienced in Australia during my time as a member of the Federal Parliament, which began in the mid-1980s. These changes have altered our society and its democratic processes irrevocably.

During that same period, and of course stretching back somewhat longer, there has been no less significant change to Australia's democratic processes, effected by changes to the structure and content of the system of administrative law review in Australia, at both Commonwealth and State/Territory level. We have come a long way since the groundbreaking impacts of the Kerr, Bland and Ellicott Committees. Major highlights have included the introduction of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth), the introduction of Freedom of Information legislation in all jurisdictions except the Northern Territory, and the introduction and evolution of tribunals with general merit review jurisdiction akin to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The important investigatory roles in the administrative law system that are played in each Australian jurisdiction by agencies such as the offices of the Ombudsman, and by human rights and anti-corruption agencies, have also evolved greatly since the mid-1980s.

The net result of these changes is that Australia has developed a system of administrative law that is widely acknowledged as a world leader. Indeed it is understood that the soon to be released UK Leggatt

Report on Tribunals draws heavily on the Australian experience, as too did South Africa in the far-reaching reforms it introduced to its own administrative justice system.

There is, of course, always room for improvement in any system. And even the most talented and successful wunderkind needs guidance. That is why the last Labor government in Australia gave serious attention to reviewing our maturing administrative law system to improve its performance. In my then capacity as Minister for Justice, I asked the Administrative Review Council to undertake an inquiry into the effectiveness of Commonwealth review tribunals. The result was the Better Decisions report of 1995, a work whose recommendations still have not been implemented, but which stands as an important resource for law reform in this important area.

I will not dwell on too many historical details today. Rather, I shall keep to the brief set for me by the organisers of this conference. Namely - should the future design of the Australian administrative law system be a local jurisdictional matter, with each parliament and government free to adopt its own model? Or should there be national minimum standards?

I will not keep you in suspense but will answer this question upfront. It is my view that, subject to constitutional limitations, there should be greater commonality on administrative law principles across the country. This is not to say, of course, that there should be complete uniformity. We are all familiar with the importance in our Federal system of allowing reasonable and appropriate differences to exist between Commonwealth, State and Territory legal schemes, and of the benefits of constructive and spirited negotiations between the senior law officers of various jurisdictions in relation to those differences.

With that important caveat, it is nonetheless clear that our administrative law system would benefit from greater convergence - both in principle and in practice - across jurisdictions. This is not least because of the significant growth in recent years in national scheme laws -across the broadest range of subject matter, from road transport; to agricultural marketing; to welfare; to labelling; to gene technology and so on. These laws increasingly affect the lives of the widest range of Australians, in a wide variety of ways. It is clearly desirable that there be maximum consistency across our nation in terms of legal redress associated with government decision-making in implementing this large, and growing, web of laws.

The central impediment to national consistency in Australian administrative law systems has been constitutional. Constitutional arrangements at State, Territory and Commonwealth level have had a particularly pronounced differential effect on the workings of administrative law tribunals. Two key points of difference are: differences in jurisdiction; and differences in judicial leadership. I will now outline these points of difference; for more detailed exposition, see the analysis offered by Robin Creyke in her paper delivered at the ANU's Public Law Weekend last November.

The first constitutionally based point of jurisdictional difference results from the absence of a formal limitation of separation of powers at State and Territory level. As Creyke notes, this 'has freed State and Territories to grant jurisdiction to tribunals in a manner which is not possible in the Commonwealth. The result has been the creation of tribunals with a truly polyglot jurisdiction.'

The growth of this polyglot - or, as Creyke terms it, 'Christmas pudding' -jurisdiction has meant that we now see executive, legislative and judicial powers being exercised by the generalist administrative tribunals at State and Territory level. This has been particularly the case in New South Wales and Victoria and, to a somewhat lesser extent, in the Australian Capital Territory. Creyke identifies a growing

cultural shift in consequence in the manner of operation of State and Territory tribunals, as cross-membership of panels is encouraged, especially across the administrative/civil divide. She argues this will lead increasingly to 'cross-fertilisation of practices which will inevitably tend towards the quasi-judicial mode of procedure.'

This is in distinct contrast to both the Commonwealth model that served as the foundational blueprint for these State and Territory bodies (ie the AAT) and, to a more dramatic extent, its proposed replacement (the ART) - which the Coalition intends to place firmly at the administrative, rather than judicial, extreme of potential models for administrative review bodies.

The second relevant point of jurisdictional difference is not disconnected from the first. It relates to the judicial leadership of tribunals. At State level - following on from the groundbreaking example set at Commonwealth level in relation to the AAT - there has been a strong preference for judicial appointments to the senior positions in administrative tribunals, including to their presidency. Again, this has been the case most especially in New South Wales and Victoria, where there has been a close, mutually beneficial and - again - cross-fertilising professional relationship between the courts and the administrative tribunals. This has had a valuable practical effect on the quality of tribunal decision-making, on the public reputation of the tribunals, and on the internal culture of the tribunals.

Yet at Commonwealth level the Coalition government now proposes to reject these potential benefits, as the president of its proposed ART will not be a judicial appointment. Incredibly, the Coalition government has not even proposed that the president be a legal practitioner of any standing or have any experience in the area of administrative review. This proposal runs counter to both the letter and spirit of the recommendation in the Better Decisions report that the head of such a body 'have high legal skills, high level experience in decision-making and dispute resolution, and an ability to determine authoritatively any decision from the diverse range of matters that would come before the tribunal', qualities that 'would ordinarily (but not necessarily) be found in a person who is a judge, or who has legal skills broadly equivalent to a judge.'

Of course, since the trilogy of High Court Decisions - Grollo, Kable and Wilson - there must be doubts as to the constitutionality of appointing a judge as head of any Commonwealth tribunal, including the proposed ART, especially if they are more closely allied to the executive and subject to Ministerial directions, even if only relating to procedure. These doubts should not be overstated, however, as this potential impediment to judicial appointment in the ART context is clearly not absolute. The Coalition's position on this issue arguably is yet another example of its unwillingness to approach law reform with a more open and creative mind, in order to develop the best possible legal structures and institutions that deliver the highest quality justice to Australians.

This criticism is not opportunistic political point-scoring on my part. The Shadow Attorney-General and the Opposition have consistently challenged the Coalition's ART proposal. This is not because we are opposed in principle to reforming the Commonwealth's tribunal system by bringing the specialist tribunals under 'one umbrella.' Rather, it is because the Coalition's specific reform proposal does not appropriately implement the important recommendations of the Administrative Review Tribunal as stated in the Better Decisions report, and as a consequence the Coalition's proposal poses a serious threat both to the quality and independence of the administrative decision-making process.

I have spent some time today outlining some impediments to greater uniformity between administrative law systems in Australia. These are substantial impediments deriving from important constitutional

checks and balances that are integral to Australian democracy. Like many such impediments, however, these impediments are neither absolute nor entirely immutable. They present some opportunities for constructive law reform.

These impediments aside, it must not be forgotten that there has nonetheless been a very successful marriage of Commonwealth, State and Territory minds in the area of direction-setting in administrative law.

As one important example of this, the States have tended - albeit belatedly and then with regional variations that do deserve some mention here - to adopt the Commonwealth's generalist administrative tribunal model. That model was picked up first in Victoria with its AAT, then in the ACT and in South Australia. In South Australia the regional variation was to make the administrative appeals body a division of a court - the District Court in that State - partly as a cost-saving measure and partly so that it was not such a threat to the judiciary and judicial culture. Subsequently NSW and Victoria, set up their ADT and VCAT respectively, with a combination of civil and administrative jurisdiction as the major departure from the Commonwealth model. In Tasmania at present there is a proposal to put the merits review jurisdiction in the Tasmanian Magistrates Court. I understand that Western Australia is also looking at this issue (Michael Barker QC has been asked to put together a proposal by June/July), following on from the proposal by the WALRC for a WACAT, which would be similar in structure and functions to the ADT and the VCAT.

Significantly, the following essential elements of Commonwealth administrative review tribunals are also core elements of the merits review tribunals at State level. In summary (a fuller account is given by John McMillan in the book of papers celebrating twenty years of the AAT):

they conduct de novo merits review (the meaning that has accrued to those terms being as developed by the Commonwealth AAT); Ã¢ÂÂÃ¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»

they have wide jurisdiction; Ã¢ÂÂÃ¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â» they are not intended to be court-substitute bodies (at least in their administrative jurisdictions), and hence are not bound by rules of evidence, operate informally and to an extent in an inquisitorial fashion; and

Ã¢ÂÂÃ¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»

they are relatively cheap and accessible. Ã¢ÂÂÃ¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»

A further important example of Commonwealth/State convergence on administrative law matters is that the States have all now adopted the Commonwealth's Ombudsman model - again, with variations that deserve mention. Both Queensland and Western Australia have Parliamentary Commissioners rather than Ombudsman as their officials, and the greater closeness of the officials in those States to the Parliament changes the nature of the body to an extent. Once again, however, there are core notions in the legislation setting up all the offices. Hence the Ombudsman's principal function is investigation and recommendation - it is not adjudicative. The core principles against which the efficacy of administrative action is tested by the Ombudsman are common to all jurisdictions; although the breadth of the Ombudsman's powers is somewhat different. Again, these differences lie at the margins. For example, some Ombudsmen lack the power to consider policing matters; some cannot investigate FOI matters; some cannot investigate decisions by Ministers.

The fact that every jurisdiction has adopted the office is indicative both of the success of this mode of administrative redress and of its importance in contributing to greater national consistency in

administrative law procedure.

It should be noted, however, that a divergence may be developing at present between Commonwealth and State approaches as the office of the Commonwealth Ombudsman displays an increased focus on own motion and systemic reviews - as being of greater overall benefit for the limited resources available to that office, than investigations of individual complaints. This potential divergence may of course in time lead to a reconvergence, as the trend could be picked up and run with at State level.

Another area in which trends of Commonwealth/State divergence and reconvergence might develop in the future relates to the extent to which Ombudsmen will scrutinise actions taken by private sector bodies performing government functions under contracted-out arrangements (as does, for example, the Parliamentary Commissioner in the United Kingdom).

A second untested area and zone of possible Commonwealth/State divergence and reconvergence relates to the extent in which Ombudsman may begin to take explicit account of rights jurisprudence drawn from domestic and international law sources. Arguably we are beginning to see this latter development in an implicit sense- two important recent examples being the Commonwealth Ombudsman's March 2001 reports of own motion investigations into the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs' Immigration Centres and into Immigration Detainees held in State Correctional Facilities. Both reports raise some important concerns about the human rights dimensions of the Howard government's management of the mandatory detention regime, highlighting problematic aspects of detaining asylum seekers in prisons or prison-like conditions.

Today I have provided a broad-brush overview in an attempt to highlight two opposing trends in the development of administrative law. One is the 'trend of resistance' which operates against national uniformity, resistance occasioned largely by constitutional (but also political) impediments to harmonisation of approaches at Commonwealth, State and Territory levels. The other is the 'trend of consistency' which has seen successful Commonwealth initiatives such as the Ombudsman model and many key aspects of the generalist tribunal model copied at State and Territory level. FOI legislation is of course another example of this trend of successful State and Territory adoption of the Commonwealth model.

These opposing trends are in constant tension - and play themselves out in more complex ways in application to different aspects of administrative law, that I have not discussed today - for example, in relation to administrative law remedies, and in relation to standing.

I have already indicated my general preference, subject to constitutional limitations, for outcomes in administrative law reform inclining towards the victory of consistency over divergence. I have not attempted, however, to be too prescriptive here about the content of those outcomes. Good law reform -and indeed responsible political representation - depends upon effective consultation as much as upon imposition of pre-existing ideological preference. It also depends upon an ability and willingness to see the big picture: to understand where we might be heading as a society, to discuss and determine where we should be heading, to discern what is the best way to get there, and to negotiate compromises and difficulties along the way. This is how we bring about law reform that enhances - rather than undermines - our democracy. Authorised by Geoff Walsh, 19 National Circuit, Barton ACT 2600.
