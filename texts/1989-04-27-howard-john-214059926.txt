TOWARDS 2000: AUSTRALIA/ASIA RELATIONS

As I deliver this lecture the United States' Vice-PreSident  is a guest of Australia; the entire world looks with  apprehension at the political scene in Japan; and those who  care about the security of our region can only gasp with  astonishment at the level of irresponsibility achieved by  the New Zealand Prime Minister at Yale University.

His speech was nothing more than a cheap political .  denunciation of the American alliance inspired by a sliding  domestic political situation. Its consequences are far  reaching for the people of New Zealand. Ultimately, of

course, he must account for that before the bar of  New Zealand public opinion.

The Lange speech contains some expansive assumptions about  the Australia/New Zealand defence relationship which raise  legitimate questions as to whether prior consultation with  the Australian government took place.

I mention these issues to emphasise that our relations with  the Asian region are heavily influenced by two nations which  project immense power in that region, namely, Japan and the  United States.

It is also a fact that there is now greater hope for world  stability. The warmer relations between the United States  and the Soviet Union must encourage us all.

In feeling encouraged we must not forget that United States  strength, military preparedness and strategic resolution  played a major role in bringing the Soviets to the  bargaining table. Western unity has also been crucial in

this process.

Tonight the main focus of my speech will be Australia's  relations with the Asian region but I must stress at the  outset that I will not be giving an exhaustive rundown of  how I see our relations with each individual country for

time does not permit that detail.

I will, instead, look at the broader canvass of our  relations with Asia and how we can best place ourselves to  take advantage of the opportunities and challenges the short  to medium-term future presents.  .

As with all relationships, hard-headed self-interest will  dominate Australia's approach to the Asian region. We must  likewise expect the nations of that region to be influenced  by similar considerations.

The relationship should not be trivialised. A prime recent  I example of that trivialisation was the taudry attempt by the  | Prime Minister to promote at every opportunity in Australia  .  and overseas the so-called Asian immigration debate as a  I1 -  major issue in our relations with countries in the Asian

region.

2

As recently as last November the Prime Minister told a  conference:

"The so-called immigration debate has done more damage  to Australia's image and influence in Asia than any  single event in recent times."

Unfortunately for the Prime Minister, but fortunately for  Australia, Mr Hawke was shot in the back by one of his own  troops, Senator Ray, who in Hong Kong in February bluntly  repudiated the extravagant misleading claims of the

Prime Minister.

Thankfully these prime ministerial ramblings appear to have  ceased.

Our relations with Asia are diverse. They require mature,  sober analysis. They will be enhanced by a careful taking  of the long view but will be diminished by trivial and  emotionally charged point scoring for domestic political  purposes.

Coalition governments have sought to pursue a concerted  policy towards.Asia in the context of Australia's global  interests as a middle power member of the Western Alliance.

Ever since Australia began to develop distinctly independent  capacities in foreign policy, Asia has been seen as an area  of critical importance.

There are particularly strong reasons why Australia must now  pay even closer attention to developments in Asia and their  political and economic implications for us.

A major reason is, of course, the Asian region's dynamic  economic performance. In the quarter century that began in  1960:

.  Asia's economies grew at an average real rate of 6% per  year compared with 3% for the United States and the  European Community '

.  Asia's share of gross world product more than tripled  from 1967 to 1987 from 6% to 20%. Its share of  manufactured exports went from 8% to 18% and its share  of imports of all kinds from 12% to 17%.

The relevance to Australia for this region of dynamic  economic growth is clear - our trade with Asia has grown.in  importance to the point where over 50% of our exports are  directed to the region while it supplies 40% of our imports.

A second major reason for Australia to review and expand its  relations with Asia is that the region is experiencing a  series of important changes in the distribution of economic  and political power which require our close attention.

3

These important developments include:

.  the evolution of the United States/Japan relationship

.  the long term regional economic and political  implications of China's reform programme

.  the implications for the regional strategic balance of  President Gorbachev's political initiatives and

.  the important changes that have occurred in areas of  regional tension and conflict such as the Korean  peninsula, Indo-China andzthe Philippines,

Some of these developments offer prospects for increased  cooperation and stability in the region.  Others remain  potential conflict areas that will continue to pose dangers  to regional stability and will therefore need careful  assessment by Australia.

Before I address these issues, I would like to state  unequivocally that it was past Liberal/National Party  governments that were largely responsible for developing the  framework of Australia's post war relations with Asia.

It is relevant to bear in mind the record of successive  Liberal governments in the post war period because the broad  principles and objectives pursued then remain, to a  considerable degree, valid now.

Before World War II Asia was seldom the central focus of our  external concerns. Australia inevitably looked at Asia  through the prism of the colonial powers, including, most  importantly, the British empire with its network of colonies  and its assumed impregnable Singapore base.

Up until the end of the 1930s we had no independent  diplomatic service to gather information directly and  Australians at large had little contact with Asia or its  peoples. :

While war and post-war Labor governments took some of the  first steps in Australia's orientation towards Asia, the _ Ã¢ÂÂ    foundations of Australia's policies towards Asia were laid  largely by coalition governments pursuing a series of  constructive policies.

Liberal governments from 1949 sought to base policies  towards Asia, and the world in general, on a sound alliance  relationship with the United States. The ANZUS.Treaty of  1951 gave Australia a basis for confidence in building  networks of relationships with Asia.

Liberal governments went on to encourage constructive  Western involvement in regional security by supporting:

4

.  the US/Japan Security Treaty of 1951

.  the Manila Treaty of 1954 which sponsored the now.  defunct SEATO and

.  the Five Power Defence Arrangements of 1971 i

which continue to provide a valued basis for cooperation  between Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia and Singapore long  after Britain refocussed her attention towards the Atlantic  and Europe.

Liberal governments backed-up Australia's commitments to  allies and neighbouring states in Asia by defence  assistance:

.  we supported the United Nation forces to defend South  Korea and thus helped pave the way for that country's  spectacular economic development

.  we supported the emergence of Malaysia as an independent  multi-racial democratic state by helping to defeat the  communist insurgency

. we assisted Malaysia during its "confrontation", thereby  contributing to the prospects of political stability in  Southeast Asia and

. we made a major commitment to the ultimately  unsuccessful allied effort in Vietnam.

Other important policies were initiated by past Liberal  governments.

We made a major effort to promote economic development in  Asia through the Colombo Plan, proposed by Sir Percy Spender-  in January 1950. .

That plan sponsored a series of bilateral aid programmes  that matched the specific needs of developing Asian  countries with the capacities of Western donors. Numerous  Australian technical experts served throughout Asia  developing invaluable professional and personal contacts.

We moved to materially assist Asian countries by developing  an extensive student programme.

That programme made a major contribution to developing  Australians' awareness of Asia and its people. The students  were widely welcomed and accepted here and thousands of - Â­ Australians were able for the first time to develop direct

personal contacts with people from Asia. i " '

We also moved to revise attitudes towards Asia by a process  /  of progressive, careful liberalisation of our immigration  policy.

5

In the late 1970s it was the Liberal/National Party  government that made a substantial contribution to  Australia/Asia relations by responding actively to the  Indo-China refugee crisis.

We helped alleviate the serious regional political and  humanitarian problems from that crisis by closely  cooperating with the ASEAN states in achieving an  international response to the crisis.

Within Australia itself an expansion of interest in Asia was  evident in a variety of ways.

Tourism from Australia to Asia expanded greatly and the  study of Asia in Australian schools and universities grew  extensively, aided by the Menzies government's substantial  expansion of tertiary education in the late 1950s.

These wide ranging initiatives clearly show Liberal  governments have pursued flexible and innovative policies  towards Asia. .  -

They have been based on a desire both to:

.  maintain and bolster traditional associations and

.  forge new relationships with the countries of Asia.

The next Liberal/National Party government will continue to  build on that record.

I turn now to some current trends in North Asia.

North Asia -

The two major developments affecting the countries of North :   Asia in recent years have been the continued expansion of  their economies and the changing politico/strategic  environment of the region.  .

The two processes are intimately linked.

The economic dynamism of the region has assisted in the  consolidation of greater political stability within these  States which, in turn has created a political environment  conducive to further economic development.

At the same time, the increasing importance of Northeast  Asia in the international economy has heightened the  interest in it of major powers - notably the Soviet Union -  and has thus enhanced its political/strategic significance.

The countries of North Asia provide the economic dynamism  for the Asia/Pacific region and the responsibility for the  emergence of this region as one of. the great centres of the  international economy.  .

6

It is worth remembering that the total GNP of Japan, the  Republic of Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong stood at over  $US2 trillion in 19871 Ã¢ÂÂ

The Japanese economy, of course, provides the key to this  dynamism. In 1986 its GNP was SUS1.9 trillion with a  balance of payments surplus of $US98.7 billion. In other  words, Japan is one of the two dominant global economies

accounting for 10% of total world economic output as well as  being the world's largest creditor nation.

As a result, it now plays an increasingly important role in  the management of the international economy.

At the same time, the People's Republic of China has engaged  in an active policy of economic modernisation since 1979,  which has enabled it to achieve annual growth rates greater  than those of other centrally planned economies. Its GNP

growth last year increased by 8%.

The major problem for the economies of these North-east  Asian states is the emergence of trade protection sentiments  in the European Community and the United States which has, I  believe, largely arisen in response to their own single  minded pursuit of export-led economic growth.

As we end the 1980s, the United States' economy is in a more  vulnerable position than at any time since before the Second  World War.

Throughout this decade there has been a serious blowout of  the US budget. The budget deficit has averaged 4.8% of GNP  compared with only 1.1% for the thirty years between 1951  and 1982.

This economic vulnerability - and I hasten to add that I ~  believe it can be redressed by adequate fiscal policies -  nonetheless must have an impact on US ability and  willingness - to meet.its strategic responsibilities.

A further economic development of this past decade has been  the moves towards greater integration and interdependence of  the economies of Asia. ÃÂ

Japan has played the central role in this process.  Through  policies such as increased direct investment in the Asian  region, increased flows of aid and the official  encouragement of Japanese tourism, it has provided the  region with new sources of economic growth.

At the same time, structural change in the Japanese economy  has been accompanied by the movement of the Newly  Industrialised Countries into those areas of trade and  industrial production previously dominated by Japan; while

the ASEAN countries and the PRC are beginning to replace the  NICs as the exporters of labour-intensive products.

7

In addition to its greater interdependence with the Japanese  economy, the PRC also stands to benefit from the return of  Hong Kong in 1997 and from its own increased economic"  relations with Taiwan.

These developments can only strengthen the process of  economic modernisation within the PRC and enhance the  importance of the Chinese economy within the Asian region.

North Asia, however, remains a region of political and  strategic uncertainty where both the United States and the  Soviet Union have strategic interests but where the  stability provided by major alliance systems such as NATO  and the Warsaw Pact in Europe is notably absent.

Certain political developments over the last few years  hold out the possibility of a reduction in tensions.

The Soviet Union has launched a series of diplomatic probes  which appear to signal its willingness to seek political  solutions to its disputes with several states in the region.

These overtures have been supplemented by some positive  concrete measures such as the withdrawal of Soviet troops  from Afghanistan.

The process of normalisation of Soviet/Chinese relations has  gathered some pace.

Some progress has been made containing tensions within the  Korean peninsula and the Seoul Olympics took place without  disruption.

The PRC recognises that its ability to pursue domestic  economic modernisation requires a stable political and  strategic environment in the region. .

It is attempting to achieve this through the adoption of a  broad based policy of -peaceful co-existence involving the  reduction of tensions with all its former rivals and  enemies.

This policy is reinforced by China's anxiety not to be left  behind in any normalisation of relations between the United  States and the Soviet Union.

At the same time, I believe the PRC will emerge as a major  regional - indeed global - power early into the next century  as its policies of economic modernisation gather momentum.

This will have important implications for the regional power  balance. It is worth noting that the PRC is already a  nuclear weapons power; indeed - the only Asian regional  nuclear power if the US and USSR are excluded.

As I have already noted, Japan is now the major economic  power in the region. It is in the process of assuming a  greater political role in the region commensurate with its  economic power.

8

As part of its strategy for assuming a larger political  role, we have seen Japan seek greater influence within such  multilateral organisations as the IMF, the World Bank and  the Asian Development Bank and to recycle its US dollar

surpluses in the form of soft loans to the ASEAN and South  Pacific states.

I believe that the alliance relationship with the United  States will remain fundamental to Japan for the foreseeable  future.  .

It is this relationship that is, after all, the ultimate  guarantee of Japans security and which has provided it with  the opportunity over the past three decades to devote its  energies to economic growth.

Nonetheless, it is apparent that this relationship is  currently undergoing a period of some re-adjustment to  accommodate the new power relativity between Japan and the  United States.

However, domestic economic and political considerations will .   inevitably require more heavy reliance by states in the  region.

The Guam doctrine will remain alive and well.

Meanwhile, other states in the region are moving to increase  their roles and influence, notably Japan, the PRC and the  Soviet Union.

As a result of these developments, I believe that it is  highly likely that in the course of the early part of the  new century a multipolar balance of power will emerge in the  region as Northeast Asia becomes a major political as well ^  as economic centre in the international system. "

With the emergence of' such a system, the major players in  the region might well; place greater emphasis on political  negotiation rather than military confrontation.  This in  turn would reflect the greater importance accorded to  economic issues in their respective foreign policies and the  greater economic interdependence within the region.

Southeast Asia

Southeast Asia continues to face a complex set of problems  and challenges.

Economically as a whole, ASEAN has established a record of  growth - striking in comparison with the communist economies  which lag far behindÂ·

They are economic basket cases by comparison with their  ASEAN neighbours.

9

There are, of course, few bilateral relations involving  Australia which are as important as our relationship with  Indonesia.  ,

Despite some recent improvements and the recent visit by  Foreign Minister Alatas to Australia, Australia/Indonesia 4 relations will continue to require careful management.

The next coalition government will consult with Jakarta and  Port Moresby on the establishment of regular trilateral  ministerial talks as a means for developing cooperation on  questions of common concern and resolving bilateral or  trilateral issues. .

Both sides must learn to understand each other better and  work actively for long-term progress and substance to the  relationship. Each has a responsibility to promote a better  and deeper understanding of each other's culture and values.

Politically the ASEAN region faces ongoing and complex  sources of conflict which are being affected strongly by  changing relationships among the major powers. .

While developments in major power relations appear to be  having a positive impact on prospects for a settlement in  Cambodia, the future of that country, still remains highly  uncertain.

ASEAN members have consistently been aware that their  economic prospects depend on the maintenance of a favourable  international environment in which their exports can gain

market access.

It is for this reason that ASEAN has conducted regular joint  dialogues with its major trading partners, notably Japan,  the US and the EEC. While the ASEAN states' economic -performance has been favourable, they have felt the impact  of recent tensions in' international trade relations.

They have recently had the disconcerting - and for them,  new - experience of some conflict in their economic .   relations with the United States and have acted vigorously  and vociferously to US trade protection measures introduced

into the US Congress.

These areas of discord have illustrated the fact that  relationships involving international and regional security  with a major power is not in itself an effective guarantee  against clashes of interest in trade and economic relations,   when that major power is itself under international economic "

pressure.

Despite these ongoing difficulties, the ASEAN economies are  generally performing strongly.

I think it is important to underline the fact that this is  in strong contrast to the continuing debilitation of the  region's socialist economies of Indo China and in Burma.

10

Vietnam, the second largest country in the region, seems  intent on remaining a spectator to the continued progress of  the non-communist regional economies. Despite Vietnam's  tentative efforts at economic reform, it remains firmly tied  to the Soviet bloc in a dependency relationship with a  divided leadership on the key issue of economic reform.

I turn now to security issues within Southeast Asia.

The recent trends towards detente between the major powers  obviously gives rise to some optimism that regional  conflicts in the region may be negotiated as a by-product of  this dialogue.

Nonetheless, I remain sceptical in relation to the conflict  over Cambodia.

My major concern is the possibility that the Khmer Rouge  could be returned to power.  I will return to this in more  detail in a short while.

Further focus of attention and concern in regional security  is the situation in the Philippines.

Since coming to power in 1986 the Aquino Government has made  substantial progress in rebuilding political democratic  institutions, restoring civil liberties and promoting  economic recovery.

The Philippines, however,  continues to confront two major  issues which have enormous implications for the ASEAN  region, and not the least for Australia.

While communism has been a declining force in the other  ASEAN countries, indeed where it is now of only marginal  significance, the insurgency in thei Philippines has actually  been expanding.

Whereas in February 1986, the strength of the New People's  Army was estimated at 22,000 in 1988 the estimate was  between 24,000 and 26,000.

The NPA appears to be operating effectively in a  decentralised way. The Armed Forces Chief of Staff, General  Renato de Villa, has claimed that the Communist Party has a  six year plan to bring the country to a strategic stalemate.

The insurgency in the Philippines is a major national and  regional problem.

The continuing challenge of the NPA is forcing the  Philippines Government to spend heavily to oppose it -  President Aquino proposes to spend 10% of the 1989 budget to

equip the armed forces, a 43% increase over the previous  year.

This ongoing commitment imposes further strain on the  Philippines economy. It also, of course, places great  pressure on the newly established structure of  Constitutional government.

11

The future of the US bases is also an issue of critical  importance.

The recent agreement between the Philippines and the United  States has provided for mutually satisfactory terms for the  bases' presence until 1991 but a further agreement is needed  when the current 25 year treaty runs out in that year.

The US presence is an important contribution to the overall  security of the Southeast Asia/Pacific region and its  removal would be a major setback to regional security.

The importance of the US presence is reinforced by the  Soviet's expanded pressure in the region through their use  of Cam Rahn Bay.

Of course, the issue of the bases' future after 1991 is a  matter to be decided by the two governments concerned. I  would simply add my voice in support of a continued US  presence as strongly in the interest of the preservation of

security in the ASEAN region at a time of continuing  potential for major power competition for influence in the  region.

Australia and Asia

The process of economic and political change underway in  both North and Southeast Asia poses significant challenges  and opportunities for Australia.

The process of economic growth and structural change in Asia  is of critical importance for us at a time when we need  expanding export opportunities and when we face the dangers  of the growth of regional trading blocs in Europe and North  America which can so easily restrict Australia's trading  prospects. ....

Politically, the Asian region is currently subject to  important shifts in dispositions of power and influence:

.  the US faces economic constraints

.  Japan is enhancing its regional political role and

.  changes in the Soviet and Chinese policies both  increase bases for accommodation between them and  increase their long term interest in the region.

This climate may see a reduction in some areas of tension  such as Cambodia but the Asian region will continue to be  the focus of intense major power interest and a series of  internal and interstate problems that will challenge  regional security and stability.

It is imperative that Australia now broaden its ties with  the countries of the region and, in particular, further  develop its political relationship with them.

12

There is no formula which can be set out that will provide a  complete prescription for Australia's Asian policies.

A number of important factors which affect the context of  those policies are themselves subject to uncertainty. For  example:

.  the course of Soviet policy and the continuation of  Gorbachev's reforms cannot be taken for granted and  Gorbachev's own tenure in office is by no means a  foregone conclusion and

.  the way in which the US will be able to deal with its  budget and trade deficit problems with the new  Administration is still not yet fully clear.

Nonetheless, a number of points can be made about the  Liberal policy approach to Asia and these draw on my Party's  constructive record.

Coalition governments have consistently emphasised three key  components in Australia's policy towards Asia:

.  First, the pursuit of a constructive regional role to  preserve security and promote conflict resolution from  the standpoint of a committed ally of the United States  and of Western interests.

.  Second, the development of wide economic relationships  in an innovative and pragmatic way.

.  Third, the construction of substantial contacts and  associations with Asia through education, immigration  and assistance to refugees.

These broad areas of emphasis remain valid in the dynamic  Asian region today.

We will have to play a larger role - political, economic and  defence - in the Western alliance system in the region as  that system responds to the changes I have outlined in the  Asia/Pacific region.

We will have to continue to promote regional security in  Southeast Asia. ASEAN, which is now entering its third  decade, continues to provide a crucial contribution to  regional stability.

Australia has a wide range of bilateral and multilateral  contacts with ASEAN and it is very much in our interests  that the association is able to maintain its sense of  identity and cohesion.

Australia can assist ASEAN by continuing to support actively  efforts to ease sources of conflict in Southeast Asia.

A decisive resolution of the Cambodian conflict is a key  requirement for enhanced regional security. .

13

The central policy aims pursued by Liberal governments in  our response to the Vietnamese invasion I believe remain  valid.

A decisive Vietnamese withdrawal must occur - and in this  regard I welcome the September deadline announced by the  Vietnamese Government - but this cannot be followed by a  return to power of the Khmer Rouge.

Australia is not a principal actor in this conflict but we  are in a position to assist Cambodia after a Vietnamese  withdrawal is achieved. .

I believe that Australian economic assistance could make a  valuable contribution towards Cambodia's rehabilitation.

The Philippines faces a series of social, economic and  political challenges which the Aquino government is trying  to meet. .

Economic assistance is obviously not the Philippines' sole  requirement but its prospects would clearly be enhanced by  the proposed international aid programme which would bring  together a number of concerned states including the United

States and Japan.  Economic reform and restructuring in the  Philippines obviously requires a substantial capital base.  The proposed international aid programme deserves Australian  support.

The changes produced from the economies of North and .   Southeast Asia by the process of regional integration ;  present us with both challenges and opportunities.

Japan remains the key to our long term economic relationship  with the region. In 1986-87 two way trade totalled ~  $A17 billion and it is likely that Japan will become our  largest growth market accounting for nearly a quarter of

export growth over the next five years.

The opportunities for us consist of: .

. the diversification of exports away from our reliance on  wheat, wool and coal and towards semi manufactured and  manufactured items such as some electronic and  scientific equipment and services such as education and

banking

.  the further expansion of the domestic tourist industry  associated with the rapid increase in Japanese tourism.  (Presently Australia is the fastest growing destination  in the world for Japanese tourists) and

. the rapid growth in Japanese investment in Australia which stood at $A3 billion in 1987. However, almost all  of this investment has been in real estate (57%) and in  tourism (40%) with very little going into manufacturing.   A major priority should be to ensure that an increasing

share of this investment is directed towards  manufacturing industry in order to maximise the benefit  to our economy.

14

The challenges for us are:

.  Australia will face intense competition from the Uftited  States and the nations of the European Community as the  latter intensify their marketing strategies in the  Asia/Pacific region. To meet such competition we will  have to develop a coherent commercial strategy towards

the region which takes account of the increasing  integration of the regional economies and emphasises the  importance of the joint ventures and increased  Australian investment in the region.

.  Increased levels of Australian investment in our region  is one important key to a close, stable, economic  relationship over the long term. .

Australia's record to date has been mixed with  increasing high levels of investment in the economies of  North Asia but a declining level in the ASEAN economies.  Levels of Australian investment in the economies of the  ASEAN states actually declined by almost half from

1982-87 from $A2.2 billion to $A1.4 billion. The rate  of decline is even greater if the changes in the  Australian dollar exchange rate over this period are  taken into account.

In 1987 Australian investment in ASEAN was only slightly  greater than that of one middle ranking West European  economy - the Netherlands. This de facto disinvestment  in the ASEAN region by Australian private enterprise is  of concern. In the first place economic relations

can serve to reinforce and strengthen political and '   security relations: our security commitment to the  region reflected by our membership of the Five Power  Agreement could only be enhanced by increased economic

involvement reflected in increased investment in the  region.

Secondly, the economies of Asia, including those of  ASEAN are undergoing a process of greater regional  integration. It is therefore important for us to  develop solid economic ties with all of these economies

in order to get in "on the ground" of such integration.  Without such an approach it is possible that we might  lose out in investment opportunities in ASEAN to Japan  and to the European Community.

.  This process of regional economic integration poses its  own set of problems for Australia. The possibility < _   exists that the greater degree of interdependence " between the economies of the region could undermine  Australia's commodity exports to the region.  For  example, China could become a major competitor in the

supply of coal to Japan - presently our most important  coal market.

15

To resolve this issue I believe Australia needs to  develop a regional economic strategy which takes account  of the growing economic interdependence between the  states of the region and which complements its bilateral

strategies.  As part of this strategy we need to  actively promote our non commodity exports to the  region, particularly services.

In developing a concerted export strategy towards the  region, we need to continue to support free trade within  the international and regional economies. Despite the  measures to open markets in Japan and lately in Korea

and Taiwan, we cannot assume that these States view  international free trade in the same way as we do.

These countries' economic growth is dependent on  capturing overseas markets for their manufactures while  at the same time protecting their domestic market from  external competition. They regard market opening as the  removal of restrictions on a case by case basis. In  other words, Japan, Taiwan and Korea regard a free  market as being composed of those elements which are

specifically committed while the West regards it as the  absence of specific prohibitions. This difference in  view means that Australia cannot take a commitment to  free trade for granted and that we must continue to  negotiate market opening arrangements with these states

for the foreseeable future.

An active Australian involvement in the Asian economies  clearly must be based on, and accompanied by, continued  interaction between Australians and people from Asia and  concerted efforts to expand the knowledge of Asia within

Australia. The expansion of the range of education  services on both scholarship and full fee basis will  continue this long term and valuable way of promoting  contacts.

I also believe that we need to ensure a greater  promotion of the study of Asian societies and languages  in Australia. Indeed, a recent statement from the  Government noted that in the area of languages only 2%

of students doing the HSC last year took an Asian  language - a fall from 3.5% in 1983. I was appalled to  hear that last year there were only 200 students who  studied Indonesian in the final year of school

throughout Australia. The economic importance of our  region surely compels more substantial efforts in this  area.

The new Soviet strategy for the Asia/Pacific region  poses a long term political challenge to Australia. It  is in our interests to respond to Soviet proposals in a  manner which safeguards and enhances long term Western  political and strategic interests in the region.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ i

16

These represent substantial diplomatic and trade  challenges - but if we grasp them and succeed, we will  assure for ourselves a prosperous, peaceful and cooperative  future into the next century. ~
