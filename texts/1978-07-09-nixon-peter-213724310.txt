AUSTRALIAN CIVIL COASTAL SURVEILLANCE

The Federal Government has decided on a major new program

to upgrade Australia's civil coastal surveillance and enforcement

capabilities.  Announcing this today, the Minister for Transport,

Mr Peter Nixon, said the new program follows Government consideration

cf a detailed report on civil coastal surveillance needs, prepared

by a special committee of permanent heads.

"The changes reflect the Government's concern over

increased evidence of smuggling, unauthorised landings, quarantine

breaches and other illegal activities along Australia's northern

coastline," Mr Nixon said.

"They also take account of the need to enforce Australia’s

fishery laws when the 200 nautical mile Australian Fishing Zone

(AFZ) is proclaimed.

.  "The Government's approach to the surveillance problem

seeks to achieve maximum practical effectiveness at reasonable

cost."

Mr Nixon said the new program involved:

.1  Introduction of daily air searches of northern

coastal areas between Geraldton and Cairns by

Ã¢ÂÂ   civil aircraft on charter to the Commonwealth. Ã¢ÂÂ  Â· Â· Â· Â· Â· . f

. .  Extension of aerial surveillance by RAAF Long-Range

Maritime Patrol aircraft to cover the 200 nautical

mile fishing zone and to meet other special

requirements.  *

.  An increase from seven to nine in the number of RAN

patrol boats directly available for civil

surveillance and enforcement.

.  The use of three specialised radar-equipped

aircraft to be chartered for special customs

response and the re-deployment of two customs

.  launches to Geraldton and Port Hedland, with the

Ã¢ÂÂ   .  retention of a third launch at Broome.  '

.  The appointment of the Minister for Transport as

the Government spokesman on the nature and adequacy

of civil coastal surveillance matters and the

improvement of surveillance management.

.  .  Improvements in surveillance and intelligence '

collection which would improve and extend existing

x  voluntary reporting systems and. encourage wider

general public reporting.

.  .  Continuation of existing surveillance activities

specifically directed to the detection of Indo-

.  Chinese refugee boats.

"The impact of the new program can be seen in the fact

that there will be a total of about 27,000 military and civil

aircraft flying hours dedicated to civil surveillance in 1978-79

compared with some A,200 military and 400 civil charter hours

flown in 1977-78," said Mr Nixon. Â·  Â· Â·  Â·  7 .  . .  :  .,

"The program to be introduced will involve additional

expenditure of about $5 million a year for chartering civil

aircraft. As well as this, greater use will be made of existing

Defence Force resources,  the cost of which will be absorbed in

the Defence budget.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢'Moreover,  the Government intends to consult with State

Governments on ways in which they may be able to supplement the

Commonwealth's program and co-operate in its implementation by

providing equipment, facilities or other assistance which would

effectively aid the total effort.

"The Government's objective has been to introduce a

surveillance and enforcement capability which combines deterrence

of breaches of customs,  health, immigration, fisheries and other

relevant laws with the highest practicable protection of national

quarantine interests." .

/  Mr Nixon said the Department of Transport would

continue to co-ordinate civil surveillance operations in close

consultation with other Commonwealth departments.  In line with

the upgraded surveillance program the Department of Transport’s

Marine Operations Centre - which co-ordinated surveillance Â·

activities in the past - would be strengthened and renamed

the "Australian Coastal Surveillance Centre*1 . 1

A special telephone service has been installed in the

surveillance centre so members of the public can report free of

charge matters of interest such as unusual or suspicious 1  .

activities of aircraft or vessels.  An easily remembered

telephone.number has been allocated for this purpose - Canberra

47 6666. '  Â·  .

Ã¢ÂÂ¢'The Government is aware that unauthorised landings

pose a risk of introducing a wide range of exotic diseases,

some of which could have grave economic consequences," .

Mr Nixon said. '  .

"While effective quarantine controls are maintained

at all established ports of entry,  special quarantine measures

are required for Australia's sparsely populated northern '

coastline where unauthorised landings may occur. Regular

aerial surveillance for.' the area concerned is regarded as the .

most practical basis for an adequate system of quarantine

control

"From the point of view of narcotics and other forms of

smuggling, the investigation of suspicious sightings and the

arrest of offenders is a specialist activity handled by the

Bureau of Customs.. But theÂ·detection of smugglers in remote

areas also requires the support of an effective surveillance

system. .  Â·

"The Government's program takes account of these needs

by providing three specially-tasked charter aircraft for use by

Customs and the repositioning of specialist Customs launches to

high risk areas." .

Mr Nixon said that with the introduction of the 200

nautical mile Fishing Zone, a new system of licensing would be

introduced which would provide a significant level of control

and at the same time hold physical surveillance effort at '7  .

acceptable levels. '

"Licensed foreign fishing vessels will have to report

their position at specified intervals,  display effective means

of identification and call at Australian ports for inspection,"

he said.

"The main thrust of. fisheries surveillance can thus

be concentrated on the detection and apprehension of unlicensed

foreign intruders." .

The new program would allow for effective regular

monitoring of the Australian Fishing Zone and would provide

additional RAN patrol boats to carry out enforcement activities

and spot checks for compliance by licensed foreign boats with

Australian requirements.

"Special emphasis will be given to intelligence collection

and analysis so that expensive surveillance vehicles can be used

to the best possible effect," said Mr Nixon. .

"The new program is designed to be sufficiently flexible

to allow surveillance and enforcement measures to be varied quickly

to meet changing circumstances.

"In deciding on the present program the Government .

has taken into account the considerations raised in the "Report

on Surveillance and Reaction" by the Government Members' Foreign .  '  J

Affairs and Defence Committee.

"The Governement has reserved for the. future the possible ‘ Â· Ã¢ÂÂ   Ã¢ÂÂ   . . T

acquisition of any additional specialised surveillance equipment

pending the accumulation of practical experience in the increased

surveillance program. For this reason the measures adopted at

this stage have been designed to provide a high degree of

flexibility without commitments to capital expenditure."

.  Mr Nixon said that although the new program would be

monitored continuously it would be subject to a major review by

the Government within two years.

"Many submissions have been received by the Government

relating to Australian surveillance needs. Most of these,

however,  have been based on assumptions of future needs which -

in the light of experience - may prove to be invalid," he said.

"In addition most of these schemes would require large-

scale capital investment. In this context the concept of a

separate coast guard system has been examined, and rejected for

the time being as a costly, duplication of existing and -available resources.

"The package of measures I have outlined today represents

a realistic and positive response to Australia's coastal

surveillance needs in the light of recent experiences."
