LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION  THE HON. TONY ABBOTT MHR  FEDERAL MEMBER FOR WARRINGAH

18 August 2010

TRANSCRIPT OF THE HON. TONY ABBOTT MHR   THE PEOPLE’S FORUM  THE BRONCOS LEAGUES CLUB, BRISBANE

E&OE……………………….………………………………………………………………………



TONY ABBOTT:

Ok, well, I’m going to come down again if I may because I think that’s a better way to handle this. This is an  exchange, it’s not a lecture. This is your opportunity to ask me what’s on your mind and this is the kind of  thing that I’ve done often enough in my electorate and I want to thank the Courier Mail and Sky for giving  me the opportunity and the Prime Minister the opportunity to do something like this here in Brisbane. We  had a good discussion in western Sydney last week and I think it’s only right and fair that we have the same  kind of discussion here in Brisbane.

Elections are very important but in the end they’re not about who becomes Prime Minister, they’re not about  which party gets into government, they’re about you, they’re about your family and they’re about our future  and that’s the issue. Who is going to give the best deal for you and your family, who is going to best secure  the future of our great country? Now, I’m asking for your support in this election to change the government.  Not because I think that Julia Gillard Kevin Rudd or the rest of them are bad people, they’re not. But I think  they’ve been a bad government. They’ve broken promises, they’ve wasted money and this mining tax,  which would be very, very damaging here in Queensland, shows that they don’t really know how to run an  economy.

It’s been a very negative campaign so far, I’m afraid to say and the reason why it’s been so negative is  because the Government doesn’t really have a record to run on. The Government’s record is record debt,  record deficit, record boats and sadly, getting rid of an elected Prime Minister in record time. Now, I didn’t  think that Kevin Rudd was a very good Prime Minister but he was elected by you, the people, just three  years ago and I think he deserves to face the people’s judgement. I didn’t think he should be executed by the  faceless men of the Labor factions.

But the question for you is, will the Coalition be better? So my commitment is that starting from day one, we  will end the waste by, for instance, giving the school infrastructure money to school communities who’ll  spend it wisely rather than just giving it to the educational bureaucrats who’ve wasted a lot of it. We will  tackle debt and deficit and we’ve announced today that the Coalition will spend $11.5 billion less over the  forward estimates period and that in 2013-14 government debt will be $30 billion lower under us than it will  be under the Labor Party. We will stop these big new taxes because you do not deserve to have your mining  industry clobbered by a big new tax. You don’t deserve to have you power bills go up because of the carbon  tax that Labor will impose if it get re-elected and we will stop the boats, not because it’s the only important  issue, there are many important issues but a sovereign, independent country has got to control its borders.  The Coalition did it before and we can do it, and will do it, again. But that’s not all we’ll do.

2

In the first term of a Coalition government there will be a fair dinkum paid parental leave scheme, an  overdue social reform, a visionary economic reform. We’ll give seniors who want to stay in employment a  fair go and most importantly, we’ll try to ensure that young people, including indigenous young people,  don’t get stuck in intergenerational unemployment. We’ll give them commitment payments if they take jobs  and stay there. We’ll give them relocation allowances to go to the places where there is work because I want  to build a better society. I want to move from a welfare state to an opportunities society.

Now, I know health is always important here in Queensland. There is no magic wand but if we had  community boards running our hospitals and not the faceless bureaucrats, they would run better. Doctors  and nurses would get a fair go for a change. So it will be better under a Coalition government. Not perfect  because nothing is ever perfect in this veil of tears but it will be better and that’s why I’m asking for your  support. We are a great people but we’ve been let down by our Government and I am now running the race  of my life to try to give this great country the better government that it deserves. So that’s probably enough  from me. Thank you for being patient. This is your forum so over to you for your questions.

DAVID SPEERS:

Thank you and just a reminder when you do ask your question, just tell us your name and what you do and  fire away.

QUESTION:

Hello Mr Abbott. My name is Tammy and I work in human resources. The current cost of living in Australia  is amongst some of the highest in the developed world. How will you go about making housing and the cost  of living more affordable?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, you’re right, the cost of living has gone up enormously. You mention housing and rents have gone up  by 17 per cent on average around Australia over the last three years and electricity has gone up by 34 per  cent around Australia over the last three years. There is no magic wand, I’ve got to say. I’d like to be able to  come in and tell you that I could make all of that that pain disappear. But the best thing we can do is try to  avoid making it worse by putting big new taxes on things. If there is a carbon tax, your electricity prices will  go through the roof. If debt and deficit continues to spiral, that puts upward pressure on interest rates. On  housing, the best thing we can try to do there is to try to keep interest rates low, to try to keep wages high  and to try to ensure that the state governments follow reasonable land release policies without putting too  many hidden taxes and charges on land. Now, that’s what we’ll try to do. As I said, there’s no magic bullet  here but good economic management is the key to a better outcome for the Australian public.

DAVID SPEERS:

Just on that, nothing particular that you’ll do on cost of living.

TONY ABBOTT:

Everything that we do is designed to help reduce cost of living pressures but there is no across the board bit  of magic that is going to dramatically reduce our cost of living.

QUESTION:

Hi. My name’s Rachel and I’m a student. People have said that by lowering the immigration rate the  economy will suffer. I was just thinking that maybe a solution that could be possible would be to ban  abortion and save lives of innocent babies and therefore build a new generation instead of just having  nobody to carry on.

TONY ABBOTT:

Ok, well look, you know, I want to see Australians have more kids. I really do. I mean, Peter Costello said it  well. He said have one for the mother, one for the father, one for the country. Good advice and the  interesting thing is that since that bit of advice the birth rate has edged up. Back then I think the birth rate  was something like 1.7. It’s now getting back up close to 2, which is good and policies like the Baby Bonus  have certainly helped there and my paid parental leave scheme, I think, almost certainly will help boost the  birth rate. So, very important, I think, that we support Australian families that have kids. We want to make  sure that families with kids get a fair deal.

As for immigration, well, I’m in favour of immigration but it's got to be sustainable. And the problem is that  we had 301,000 immigrants in 2008. We had 277,000 immigrants in 2009 and that is just not sustainable. So  we'll be cutting, by at least 100,000, on the immigration figure from 2009. It will be a maximum of 170,000  under the Coalition. So, I would like to see people who have a contribution to make welcomed in this  country but we certainly don't want to bring people in from overseas who are going to get caught in the same  traffic jams, get stuck with the same inadequate services and the same crumbling infrastructure that the rest  of us are stuck with at the moment. We’ve got to make it sustainable. That's what my objective is.

DAVID SPEERS:

I think the question though was about banning abortion.

TONY ABBOTT:

It may have been, David, you’ll notice…

DAVID SPEERS:

You didn't answer it.

TONY ABBOTT:

That’s not my policy. I wouldn't do it, I just wouldn't.

QUESTION:

Hello Mr Abbott. My name is Ron Mitchell. I'm a retired person. Mr Abbott, I'm quite concerned. You seem  to have avoided some of the bigger issues of the campaign. You've avoided an economic debate with Julia  Gillard. You didn't appear at your own broadband announcement and you weren't there for the release of  your costings this afternoon. If you have dodged these issues as Opposition Leader, what confidence can I  have that you could deal with them as Prime Minister, or is Malcolm Fraser right, that you are not ready for  government?

TONY ABBOTT:

You sound like someone who has made up his mind, Ron and you're entitled to make up your mind.

QUESTION:

I wouldn’t rely on that.

TONY ABBOTT:

4

Alright, well let’s see if I can persuade you, let’s see if I can persuade you. Look, Ron, I trust my Shadow  Ministers. I trust my Shadow Treasurer. I trust my Shadow Minister for Finance to release a costings  document. You know, when Treasurer Wayne Swan released the pre-election financial outlook document,  Julia Gillard was nowhere to be seen. So, if she wasn't there when Wayne Swan makes costings  announcements, why is it somehow a problem if I'm here talking to you rather than in Melbourne to hold  people's hands?

The other point I’d make is at least I know who my Minister for Finance would be if there was a Coalition  government. The Prime Minister, unfortunately, can't tell you who her Finance Minister will be post-election. She can’t tell you who her Defence Minister would be post-election and she can't tell you who her  Foreign Minister will be post-election, although there may well have been a deal with Kevin. Although  Kevin's not actually answering any questions. He's just making pronouncements and then leaping into the  car before any questions are put to him.

On the subject of an economic debate, I debate the economy every day, Ron. I debate the economy every  day. I gave the Prime Minister a chance last night to come to the ABC studios in Sydney and debate me.  You know what she was doing? She was sitting in a plane on the tarmac at Sydney Airport. She flew from  Queensland down to Sydney, presumably because she wanted to debate me. She must've got cold feet.  Something must've happened because she never left the airport and then she took off for Perth later on. But I  gave her that chance. I think tonight my job is to talk to you. We have lots of occasions in Parliament and in  campaigns for politicians to shout at each other, for journalists to question politicians. Tonight I think is a  rare opportunity for the public to have their say and I didn't want to cut down the public's time to question  me just so that Julia and I could shout at each other on a stage, the way we do in the Parliament.

QUESTION:

Hi Mr Abbott. My name’s Liz Johnston. I'm a communications technician. I’d like to know if you intend to  keep the initiative to have one computer per one child by next year in every school?

TONY ABBOTT:

Liz, I’m going to be a disappointment because no, we are not going to continue the Prime Minister's  Computers in Schools Programmes. Not because we don't think computers are a good thing, of course  they’re a good thing. Not because we don't think that school kids should have access to computers, of course  they should have access to computers but this has been a very inefficient, badly run programme. It's way  behind schedule and it’s way over cost. It's running two years behind schedule and it was supposed to cost  $1 billion. It's now costing $2 billion. We think that rather than just give schools computers, whether they  want them or not, we should give schools the opportunity to tell us what technological assistance they need  so we've made available $150 million that will be a more flexible and I hope a more accommodating  programme than simply the Computers in Schools Programme.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott. Lin Frame is my name. In 2008 the Productivity Commission said that drought subsidies to  farmers weren't being applied evenly across Australia. When it was put to Tony Burke, he didn't want to do  anything about it. Are you prepared to investigate this situation and adjust it?

TONY ABBOTT:

Yeah, look, the short answer is yes. Look, Tony Burke's problem is that he has been a part-time Minister for  Agriculture. For much of his time, he has been a Minister for Population, effectively he has been the de facto  Immigration Minister. We think, the Coalition thinks that agriculture is so important to our future, so  important to our economy, so important to regional and rural Australia, that you've got to have a full-time  Minister for Agriculture. Now, look, I am always happy to look at better ways of providing drought

5

subsidies. We've got support for country Australia in our DNA, in the marrow of our bones. There will be  quite a number of farmers around the Cabinet table should the Coalition win government and you can be  very confident that the last thing we would do is muck up drought assistance.

QUESTION:

Hello Mr Abbott. My name is Sarah. I'm a science communicator. Mixed racial marriage used to be  considered immoral and was illegal in some countries. Do you see the parallel between this and your stance  on gay marriage, which 30 countries in the world now consider a basic right?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, I don't think there's a parallel and I can fully understand why gay people feel that they've been ripped  off over the years, because there has certainly been lots of discrimination against gay people over the years  and I am as strong as anyone to want to see everyone given the rights and the dignity that every single  human being regardless of race, religion, colour, creed, nationality, gender, sexuality should be accorded.  But I do think, I’m sorry, I will be a disappointment, I do think that marriage by definition is between a man  and a woman. That's not to say that men and women who are married love each other more than other  people in other sorts of relationships, but I just think that the marriage relationship is between a man and a  woman.

QUESTION:

Hi Mr Abbott, my name is Sonya, I’m a HR admin officer. My question is where do you plan on making the  $25 million (sic) budget cuts as stated in The Daily Telegraph on the 21st of July of this year?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, we’ve released a long list of expenditure reductions and it is a very long list and it came out today  from Joe Hockey and Andrew Robb, but just to give you a couple of examples, we won’t go ahead with the  cash for clunkers policy. That's kind of like pink batts on wheels. The trouble with the cash for clunkers  policy is that it will put out of business a lot of good decent Aussie mechanics who are working on old cars  and it will cause a spike in sales of foreign cars because there's only two out of, I think, 900 cars on that list  that qualify that are made in Australia. So, that's one saving that we'll make. We are going to slim down the  size of the Commonwealth public service. There are 20,000 more people on the Commonwealth payroll now  than there were in 2007 and I don't think the Commonwealth Government services are that much better now  than they were in 2007. So, we'll have a 12,000 person reduction in Commonwealth employment which  we’ll achieve by natural attrition and look, if we can stop the boats and I believe we can, there's about $1  billion that we can save that would otherwise be spent on Christmas Island and building massive new  accommodation for boat people at places like Curtin Air Base, so they're a couple of examples of the kind of  savings measures that we're looking at.

QUESTION:

Hello Mr Abbott, my name is Phillip, recently retired. Now, I’ve got a two part question for you. Why do  the Liberal Party keep pushing the boat people issue? 3,000 people coming into this country. We have in this  country about 750,000 country people that are treated as second class citizens. We're spending a lot of  money on these boat people. Out of that 750,000, I'm talking about the Aboriginal people here, there are  probably between 20 and 50,000 of them don't even speak English.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, Phillip, I appreciate the question on Indigenous disadvantage and I’ll deal with that in a second, but on  the boat people, I have no desire to talk about boat people and I wouldn’t talk about boat people, except for

6

the fact that the boats keep coming. I mean, that's the problem, Phillip. I know you will say there are people  who are here illegally in this country, who don't come by boat and you're absolutely right, but there is a  world of difference between someone who comes to this country safely with documentation, by air and  someone who comes to this country unsafely without documentation by boat. I think people are right to feel  that we are not doing ourselves justice when people can just rock up on our shores from anywhere and when  they feel that people smugglers have taken over a component of our immigration programme, so that's why I  talk about it. I didn’t talk about it when the boats weren’t coming and I only started talking about it again  when the policy changed and the boats started coming again.

As for Indigenous disadvantage, I take this very seriously and I reckon that the gutsiest, the most visionary,  the most imaginative policy thinker in our country at this time and has been for at least a decade is Noel  Pearson. I have tried, not just to read Noel’s stuff but to, kind of, live the reforms that he wants to see. I  spent three weeks as a teacher's aide up at Cowan in Cape York in 2008 and last year I spent 10 days in  Aurukun as an assistant truancy officer to understand better what's happening in remote Indigenous places  and there are good things happening, there are bad things happening, but what we've got to do is give back  to Aboriginal people the right to take responsibility and the payments that I announced yesterday, the  relocation payments, the commitment bonuses for young people who take jobs and keep them, they are  designed with Aboriginal people in mind. Noel Pearson is the inspiration for those policies. Again, I don't  pretend that there is a magic wand or a silver bullet, but we’ve got to do better and certainly any government  that I lead would never cease from trying to do a better deal for the first Australians.

QUESTION:

Hello Mr Abbott, my name is Claire and I'm a small business owner. It's important to me that I have  information on all the political parties' policies when I go to vote, so I'm wondering why, considering that  the Greens are no longer a minor party, why Bob Brown has been refused at leader’s debates?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, look, he’s not going to be the Prime Minister, although depending upon the contents of the secret  preference deal between the Greens and the ALP, he may well be an unofficial Cabinet minister in the  government should the Labor Party be re-elected. Look, Bob's not in the leaders' debates because he doesn't  lead a major party. Simple as that.

QUESTION:

Good evening, Mr Abbott. My name is Shaun. I’m an apprentice plumber. My question to you is, what are  you going to do for the apprentices that are struggling for work?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, Shaun, we will try to make sure there is as much work around as possible and that means trying to  keep taxes low, trying to keep the workplace reasonably employment friendly. It means trying to keep  interest rates low so that businesses can flourish. So, the best guarantee of maximising work for everyone,  including apprentices, is to keep the economy as strong as we possibly can. When it comes to apprentices,  I’d like to see more skilled workers and the policy that we've announced is that we would have 30 Australian  technical colleges open over the next four years. These technical colleges won't be same as Labor's trade  training centres. Labor's trade training centres are essentially sheds down the back of the school with a lathe  in them. They just don’t work. Our Australian technical colleges will have their own premises, their own  dedicated trades training teachers, and they'll have strong links with local business. So I think that’s the best  way of ensuring that more kids at school who are interested in a trade get the start they deserve.

QUESTION:

Hello, Mr Abbott. My name is Bianca and I'm a uni student. I'm leaving university at the end of this year  and I’m leaving with a $36,000 HECS debt and going into a workforce in a time of economic downturn.  What is your government going to do to guarantee that I can get a job and pay that HECS debt back?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, if you don’t get a job, you won't have to pay it back until you do get a job, but I want to try to ensure,  obviously, that we maximise employment, and Bianca, in much the same way that I answered the previous  question, I want to try to and keep taxes low, interest rates low and business buoyant. That’s what I want to  do. I did, actually, I have a policy which I think I can share with this room. It's only a pilot policy, at this  stage, but volunteering is an important part of the Australian tradition. Many of our best loved community  organisations depend on volunteers. The country fire services, the state emergency services, the surf  lifesaving movement, depends on volunteers. As a pilot, we are going to introduce a scheme whereby uni  students who give considerable time to these great volunteer organisations will get a credit against their  HECS debt. So, it’s not going to be for everyone and it will start off small, but that is an idea that came out  of the 2020 Summit. It's not one that's been progressed at all by the current government, but it's one I would  like to see at least tried and we will try it if we get if we get elected on Saturday.

QUESTION:

Hi, Ricky Garbert, public servant. If I was going to vote the Coalition as my first preference, who should I  vote as my second preference and why?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, if you vote for the Coalition as number one, you second preferences probably don't matter that much,  but look, I don't presume to tell you. I want you to vote for the coalition number one and you then number  your ballot paper for the rest as you see fit.

QUESTION:

Hello Mr Abbott and I’m a Commonwealth public servant, hopefully not one to be affected by the loss of  12,000 jobs you just mentioned, but back to my question. I know you're not a believer human induced  climate change, but could I test you on peak oil? Do you acknowledge that the world is facing a future of oil  depletion and if so, how would you begin to prepare Australia for the major threat this poses to the way we  live our lives?

TONY ABBOTT:

Ok, well, you know, the interesting thing about oil reserves is that they're always being expanded. I mean, at  any one time, people think we have say 20 or 30 years of oil reserves. 20 or 30 years later, people still think  we have 20, 30, 40 or 50 years of oil reserves, as the case may be and the reason for that is because as the  technology changes, more reserves become accessible, and as the price changes, reserves that weren't really  accessible become more accessible. So, look, I know about the concept of peak oil. I don’t claim to be the  world’s greatest expert in it, but I’m sceptical as to its value as a tool for policy makers because at the right  price, we’ve got a lot more reserves than we currently think. With better technology, we’ve got a lot more  reserves than we currently think.

DAVID SPEERS:

So, are you saying, Tony Abbott, that oil is a limitless resource?

8

TONY ABBOTT:

I’m not saying that it's limitless. But it's not nearly as finite as we would think if we had looked at the kind  of studies that were done a generation ago or even now.

QUESTION:

Hi Tony, my name’s Simon, I’m an airline services coordinator. My question is because there is a lot of  confusion and media coverage about it, but I really want to know if you actually have hung up your shovel  in this area of WorkChoices. Is it a dead and buried thing or is it something you will resurrect?

TONY ABBOTT:

Ok, Simon, very fair question. Very fair question and look, just about every Labor advertisement and by  God there've been a lot of them, I mean, this makes me believe in the ABC, I've got to say, David. It's the  only channel that hasn’t had the lying advertisements from the Labor Party about WorkChoices.

DAVID SPEERS:

From the Coalition, too…

TONY ABBOTT:

Yeah, but look, I mean they really are telling lies here. As far as I am concerned, the lesson is absolutely,  totally learnt. It’s gone forever. Under any name, gone. Just gone.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, my name is Heather and I'm into unit management and my question to you is, it's been  acknowledged many times by both parties that the cost of living has gone up considerably and will probably  continue to go up in the future. The pension rise that has just been received by the pensioners has done  nothing to avoid the constant struggle that nearly all pensioners face. I'd like an answer on what policies are  going to be implemented to give pensioners some sort of hope for the future.

TONY ABBOTT:

Ok, well Heather, I don’t think I can entirely accept that pension rise has done nothing. I mean, it was quite  a substantial rise and is it did happen in significant measure because the Coalition pushed for it, and I think  that it's got to make a difference when you get substantial increases. Now, I am not proposing any additional  benefits for pensioners over and above the kind of benefits that are already built into the system. I just say  that the best way to help pensioners is to ensure that over time, we have a stronger economy, a stronger  Budget so that we can, out of a strong budgetary position, provide more benefits for pensioners. The one  thing that I think would really clobber pensioners is if there were big new consumer taxes. I mean,  pensioners are probably the most vulnerable people when it comes to things like higher prices for gas,  electricity, higher government chargers and so on, so look, I know it's cold comfort but I think the best thing  that can I do for the pensioners of Australia right now is to stop the emissions trading scheme, stop the  carbon tax, because that would do terrible things to the bills that pensioners face.

QUESTION:

Hi, my name is Chris, I’m a mum, I have a small business and I can see the advantages in both the Coalition  and the Labor Party, but what I am wondering about is what the Coalition is going to offer for high income  who are high taxpayers, have no kids, don't own property. What do you offer them?

9

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, look, Chris, you know, government can't neglect any of its citizens, but I think of all of our citizens,  they are probably the people who are best placed to look after themselves. They probably need least help  from government, so I think the best thing we can do for people who are self starters, who have done well,  who don't have that many pressing, immediate responsibilities and obligations is not to put heavy burdens on  them and I'm not planning any additional benefits for them. I'm just saying that I will try to enable them to  get on with their lives and hopefully by earning more and being entrepreneurial, you’ll boost the economy  and that means more jobs for other people who aren’t as free, if you like, as the group that you mentioned  and more tax revenue that will enable government to do all the things that it has to do for the community at  large.

DAVID SPEERS:

Can I just pick up on that, Tony Abbott, before we get to the next question? You talked about again tonight  moving from a welfare state to an opportunity society. Why not cut out some of that middle class welfare? I  mean the education rebate, your paid parental leave scheme. You could cut a lot of taxes if you got rid of  those things?

TONY ABBOTT:

Yeah, I think the argument always is what is middle class welfare? Because who is rich is very much in the  eye of the beholder. I mean, almost no one will admit to being rich and yet it doesn’t matter what my income  is, the guy who’s earning $10,000 a year more than me almost certainly is rich, you know. I mean, that’s the  trouble when we start bandying around terms like middle class welfare. For instance, is Medicare middle  class welfare? I mean, Medicare goes to the Packer family just as much as it goes to the welfare family. I  mean, is free public education middle class welfare? Are roads that don’t have tolls on them middle class  welfare? Well, by some definitions they are and yet I don’t think we should cut that out at all. When we’re  talking about the Education Tax Rebate you’ve to be in receipt of Family Tax Benefit to qualify and sure,  depending upon the size of your family, you can have an income over $100,000. But if you’ve got three or  four kids and you’ve got a big mortgage $100,000 ain’t rich. So look, I’m not proposing to cut any benefits.  I’m proposing to try to make government tighten its belt so that we do not have to force the people to tighten  their belts.

QUESTION:

My name is William King and I’m a retired plumber businessman. I’m just, a question here. Tony, if you  win the election and become Prime Minister. A couple of years ago under Labor, under Labor we had a  recession and the Labor Party gave us a stimulation package to keep the country moving therefore out of  recession. You opposed this package. Ok. In the near future with some countries in Europe going broke we  have a 50-50 chance of going into recession ourselves. What would you bring, what would you bring into  stimulation package like the one Labor has or would you have choices like as you feel you have, if you  become Prime Minister, if you feel you have a mandate from the Australian people from this election to go  back, would you be able to go back on your word and bring in WorkChoices? Or something similar to that?

TONY ABBOTT:

Ok well look, I think we’ve dealt with WorkChoice and the answer is no we wouldn’t bring it back. But  look, on the question of the stimulus payments I think there is a lot of mythology here about what the  Coalition did and didn’t do. There were two stimulus packages. The first was in late 2008 when we really  were in a crisis because the banks were very shaky and a wave of fear and loathing swept the world’s  financial markets. It was a very dangerous situation. So the first stimulus package, about $10 billion, was  fully supported by the Coalition. That wave of fear and panic passed and the banks were largely stabilised  by a range of measures taken by governments around the world, including the Australian Government.

10



Notwithstanding that the crisis had passed in February the Government proposed a further stimulus package,  in February ‘09 and that was the $42 billion package that involved pink batts, remember the pink batts? It  involved the school halls. Now, for the Government to say that that package saved us from recession when  we know how the pink batts programme has worked out. We know the waste and the fires and tragically the  deaths and as for the school hall package, for a recession that lasted, or for a crisis that lasted a couple of  months the school hall programme is dragging on for four years. The school hall programme lasts longer  than the First World War to deal with a crisis that in its acute phase lasted about six to eight weeks. So look,  we didn’t support that. We didn’t support it and we were right not to support it because we knew that  rushing out programmes like this was not going to work. That it would result in terrible waste at the very  least. So I make no apologies for not supporting the second stimulus package, for saying that the second  stimulus package was too much too soon, for wanting a much smaller second stimulus package. My problem  with the Government’s economic management here is that by spending too much, by wasting too much  they’ve weakened us. So if we do, and I hope we don’t, but if we do find ourselves in further economically  tumultuous times in a year or two’s time we will be much weaker to deal with it than we were back in 2008.

DAVID SPEERS:

But Tony Abbott, our debt position is a lot lower than the rest of the world and the question from William is  if we have a need for another stimulus package will you do it?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I will do what I think is reasonably necessary to protect the Australian economy and to protect  Australian jobs.

DAVID SPEERS:

Even if that means more debt?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, the point is that you can only do what you can. I mean, you can’t spend what you haven’t got and if  spending was some kind of a magic wand, David, why is the United States which had a comparable spend to  ours in deep recession? Why are the British who also had a large stimulus package still in deep recession?  Spending is no magic answer. You know, everyone out there with a household budget knows that spending  makes you feel good. But you can’t just spend your way out of trouble. Keep spending, you get into trouble  and in this respect, the government is not that much different from households. You can only give what  you’ve got and the Australian government has a lot less to give now because it has spent more than it  should’ve spent in stimulus money which was unnecessary.

QUESTION:

Hi Mr Abbott. I’m Billy, I’m a student and my question for you is do you worry about your media persona  and agenda is transparent to the Australian people? And furthermore, that your paternalistic use of Aussie  slang words like fair dinkum could be insulting the intelligence of the public, a public who holds your future  in their hands?

TONY ABBOTT:

Billy, I am a politician. I worry every day about my public image. Of course I worry about it, but look in the  end you’re never going to keep everyone happy all the time and I guess I’ve been around for a long time in  politically good and politically not so good circumstances and I leave it to you to make your judgment of  me.

QUESTION:

Damien Draper, landscaper. I have a tax question for you, Tony. Will you rule out increasing the GST if you  become Prime Minister of Australia?

TONY ABBOTT:

Yes I will.

QUESTION:

Hello Mr Abbott. My name’s Kerry, I’m a carer. I want to speak about veterans pensions. We are sending  our soldiers overseas. Why don’t the veterans’ pension get linked [inaudible] prior to the age of 55. The CPI  doesn’t match [inaudible], so if you’re younger you go backwards. Our young soldiers are coming home  wounded, unable to work and they’re going broke.

TONY ABBOTT:

Ok, Kerry, very good question. Very good question and look, you make a very good point. Implicit in that  question, people who put their lives on the line for our country deserve a fair go. They deserve the best  possible go from the rest of us because they, in a sense, take the ultimate risk on behalf of the rest of us. So I  am absolutely with you when it comes to giving our ex-service personnel a fair deal. Now, I’m afraid that  when it comes to the DFRB, the Defence Force Retirement Benefit, the former Government in which I  served disappointed people. The current Government promised to index those pensions to male total average  weekly earnings or CPI, whichever was the greater, and has broken that promise. I have recently promised  that at least for veterans over 55 we would index the pension to MATAWE or CPI, whichever is the greater.  So we are moving in the direction that you seek.

QUESTION:

But our soldiers that are going over that are being injured are under 55. It’s our young boys, it’s not our  Warrant Officers, it’s not our Lieutenants, it’s not our Captains or our Colonels. It’s the young diggers.

TONY ABBOTT:

I accept that and in the modern army as far as is humanly possible they rehabilitate those guys that get  injured, get wounded and they try to keep them in the services.

QUESTION:

Hi Tony, my name’s Dennis. I’m a telecommunications technician. What incentive is there for self-funded  retirees to vote for you?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, because we’ve always done a very good deal for self-funded retirees in the past. We deeply respect  people who make the effort to put money aside for their future. We want to foster that spirit of independence  and self-reliance and the last thing that we would want to do is rip you off. Having said that, you can do a lot  more as a government with a surplus of $20 billion than you can with a deficit of $57 billion. That’s why the  first thing we’ve got to do is get debt and deficit under control. Once we’ve got debt and deficit under  control and I spoke earlier about how that would happen more quickly under us, then we will be in a  position to do more. The one benefit that I probably should mention, that we are talking about this election,  is indexing the threshold for the Commonwealth Seniors Health Card. Not perhaps like giving you an extra

12

$1000 a week in your pocket but nevertheless, it is a concession that seniors have been seeking. It was an  anomaly and it’s something that we are pledged to do should we win the election.

QUESTION:

Hello Tony. My name’s Hannah Goodicson. I’m a doctor working in mental health and I’ve got a two part  question. To start with, given that your former boss, John Hewson has characterised your approach to  politics as whatever it takes and confrontational, that your economic decisions are neither planned nor  thought through in a holistic way, what evidence do we have when you say you’re going to make large cuts  to public spending, but you also claim that you want to improve our standard of living, how can we actually  expect that to be the case, given the current situation with our health system, is there going to be more  money for health in general or is the money going to mental health going to come out of something else?  And further, given that the colleagues that you’ve worked with for such a long time have so little confidence  in your ability to make sensible economic decisions, what confidence can we as a community have in you as  a potential leader?

TONY ABBOTT:

Ok, well you know, John Hewson is even more critical of Julia Gillard. So it you’re going to set him up as  an expert on me, set him up as an expert more generally.

QUESTION:

But I’m asking you.

TONY ABBOTT:

Ok,  but I just make the point, I think I’m entitled to make the point that John Hewson thinks that a Coalition  government, even under his former staffer, would be much better than a continuation of the current  Government. So I think I’m entitled to say that. Look…

QUESTION:

Has the Liberal government [sic] actually done any numbers on what our current debt would be, had the  Liberal Party been in power or are the comments that you’ve made simply political rhetoric?

TONY ABBOTT:

We would have pursued different policies. We would have spent less and therefore we would have needed to  borrow less. Now, because we aren’t in government, we’re in Opposition, we did not at every point in the  last three years put forward policy detailed to the last dotted ‘i’ and crossed ‘t’. But certainly if we’d spent  $20 billion, for argument’s sake, rather than $40 billion in the second stimulus package, you would have 20  billion bucks off the debt which isn’t a bad place to start.

Now, on health, we are not cutting health spending but we are redirecting health spending. There’s a lot of  health spending which the Government proposes which I think is basically about building better  bureaucracies rather than building better services and we’re not going to go ahead with the new  bureaucracies that are planned under the Government’s hospitals proposal and we are going to redirect  money into what we think are more urgent services, more beds.

Now, where mental health is concerned, I didn’t just dream up a policy. Peter Dutton and my staff went to  Pat McGorry, current Australian of the Year. No better expert on mental health, no more committed  Australian when it comes to a good deal for people with mental health issues and our policy is essentially  the policy that Pat McGorry recommended. $1.5 billion more. We’ll have an extra 20 EPIC centres, Early

13

Psychosis Intervention Centres. We’ll have an extra 60 headspace centres, these are for young people with  mental health problems and Pat says that he’d like more. Of course, he’d like more. I’d like more, because  health policy is always a work in progress but it’s vastly better than what the Government’s got on offer.

QUESTION:

Hi Tony. My name’s Mark Renny. I’m going to ask you about the broadband network that you’ve opposed.  In 2010, most people do have a computer, they use a computer. They use it for social networking, business  and a lot of other things. Do you really think that our network at the moment is up to it and what are you  going to do to make sure that it does cope with the growing use that it’s going to get in the next 20 years?

TONY ABBOTT:

I don’t say that our network is perfect but I’m not sure, in fact I am certain, that spending $43 billion on just  one technology is not the way to go. For instance we can spend $43 billion, $5,000 per household, building  fibre to the home but what about all those people that use their computers away from their home? Why  should they be chained to a fibre cable? I mean, how old fashioned is that, to say that you’ve got to be  plugged into a wall somewhere if you want to get access to fast broadband services? Now, we think that you  can do just as well for a lot less and that’s what our policy proposes. It’s not a cheapskate policy. It’s still  going to cost $6 billion so it’s very expensive but what we’re spending is roughly in line with what’s been  spent by countries like New Zealand and South Korea, that all the experts say have a very good broadband  plan. We want to see competitive markets here, not just government monopoly because we believe, based on  the evidence, that comparative markets nearly always give you a better outcome than government monopoly  and the other thing that I just want to leave you with is this, the Government is boasting about how fantastic  their broadband vision is, what about this internet filter? I mean, come on. I mean, these are the people who  say they believe in broadband, they believe in online services and they want to whack a filter on everything.  I mean, how much is that going to slow down the internet?

DAVID SPEERS:

Just picking up on Mark’s question though, Tony Abbott. Do you acknowledge that there are things that you  can do with fibre optics at home, at work, at the doctor’s, that you can’t do with wireless?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, you can’t at the moment. Now, that doesn’t mean that you’re not going to be able to in the future. I’m  not against fibre. I really am not against fibre and there will be more fibre under our system but I don’t think  we should put all our eggs in the high-speed fibre basket which is what the Government’s doing.

QUESTION:

Thank you. Good evening Tony. My name’s Barry. I’m an education manager. The international education  industry in Australia is worth $18.6 billion. So far in 2010 Austrade figures are showing a decline in student  numbers in both the [inaudible] sector down 20 per cent and the school sector down 12 per cent. These  declines in student numbers, I believe, will flow onto the vocational sector and the higher education sector  and I believe that they’re largely as a result of federal policy on immigration and student visa conditions.  I’m keen to know what the Coalition government would do to reverse this trend and support the third largest  earner for Australia.

TONY ABBOTT:

Ok, Barry, look, you make a good point. Education has become a very significant export industry over the  last decade or so. Very significant and I support Australian exports. I support high quality educational  institutions, of course I support that. I think the problem though is that some of our educational institutions

14

were effectively selling an immigration product rather than an educational product and that was wrong. That  was a bit of a rort to be honest and the Government, to its credit, has begun a bit of a crackdown there and  we certainly support that crackdown. So I accept what you’ve said to me that in the short term we are likely  to see significantly fewer educational exports. But I think this is necessary in order to put the industry on a  long term more sustainable basis.

QUESTION:

Thank you for that. I guess I was just particularly wanting to focus in on obviously the two sectors, the  [inaudible] school sector. We certainly are very supportive of the mainstream, dodgy colleges in existence  but as I say certainly some of those colleges that are attracting junior people here, there’s obviously a lot of  flow-on affects into that vocational sector and I don’t think it’s the government policy that’s actually been  designed to affect that, but the unfortunate reality is that it that it has affected that sector.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, Barry, one of the things that I have learnt in my nine years as a Minister in what I think was quite an  effective government is that you always have to consult with people before you change policy. I mean,  where peoples’ lives and peoples’ businesses are at risk you’ve got to talk to them first. Now, that doesn’t  mean that you’re going to be able to do everything that they want. Often you’re going to disappoint them.  But nevertheless you’ve got to talk to them first so that what you do does the least damage in a good cause  and so that as far as is possible you don’t have unintended consequences from what you do. When I was a  Minister in a government I always tried to talk first and decide later, rather than decide and discover I’d  completely stuffed things up because I thought I knew everything and I think that’s one of the real problems  in government. People making decisions on the basis of inadequate information that they could have got had  they been more diligent before they made the decision.

QUESTION:

Hello Tony, my name is Mavis Edwards and I’m retired but I work as a volunteer for Parkinson's  Queensland. I’m wondering what’s going to happen with medical research because it’s in very dire straits,  really.

TONY ABBOTT:

Sure, Mavis. Look, it’s a very important subject and you know one of the great things about Australia is that  medical research is one of those fields in which we lead the world. We punch well and truly above our  weight when it comes to medical research. We’ve got about 1 per cent of the world’s population but  something like 3 or 4 per cent of the serious medical research, the refereed medical journal articles come out  of Australia. So we really do extremely well. When I was the Health Minister I doubled health and medical  research funding. That was on top of an earlier doubling when Michael Wooldridge was the Health Minister.  Because of the fiscal position it’s a lot harder to be generous now than it was then but we have promised an  additional $150 million over and above what’s already pledged to health and medical research as part of this  election campaign.

QUESTION:

Good evening Mr Abbott. My name is Max Roby. I’m a small business owner and an employer. For many  years successive government have encouraged individuals to make provision for their retirement by both the  employer’s superannuation guarantee contribution and also allowing additional personal contributions. Until  last year this was $100,000 but has now been reduced to $50,000 or $25,000 dependent upon age. Removing  the ability or incentive to make substantial superannuation contributions in the later years of your working  life and the ability to save because other family commitments are diminished is a disincentive to provide for  financial independence in retirement. Will the Coalition government make any changes to the super rules,

15

including changing the employer guarantee contribution rates, the additional personal contribution limits or  penalty taxes on excess contributions?

TONY ABBOTT:

Ok, well look, you’re right to be a bit annoyed because prior to the last election Kevin Rudd said that there  would be no changes to the superannuation laws. Not one jot, not one tittle he said would be changed and of  course there have been a lot of changes to the superannuation regime under this Government. Now, we  opposed those changes but thus far we haven’t promised to reverse them. Again, because of the difficult  fiscal position that the Commonwealth finds itself in. As for the superannuation guarantee we support the  existing system because we think it’s an important part of a) helping people to provide for their retirement  and b) boosting national savings. But we don’t support the increase in the superannuation guarantee levy  that’s been proposed by the current Government. The current Government I think has been less than straight  with people on this. The Government says that the increased super contributions are being paid for by the  mining tax. Wrong. Wrong. About $700 million is coming out of the mining tax for low income people for  their superannuation but the $20 billion a year that would go into super, if the guarantee levy went up to 12  per cent, that would come out of workers’ pockets or it would come out of business pockets and I don’t say  that it should never happen, but I don’t think that now is the right time to do it and we are opposing it.

QUESTION:

Good evening Mr Abbott. Wayne, public sector manager. Another health question.

TONY ABBOTT:

Sure.

QUESTION:

Much has been reported about the need to train more health professionals across an extensive range of  health-related vocations. What statement would you make to voters that will convince them you’ll address  this issue?

TONY ABBOTT:

Ok, well Wayne look, when I was the Health Minister I dramatically increased the number of medical and  other health places. When I was the Health Minister the number of medical student places went up from  2,000 to 3,000 and there was a comparable percentage increase in the number of nursing places. You know,  under the former Government, nine new medical schools were opened around Australia. So we’ve got the  runs on the board, we’ve got the runs on the board. We believe in a better health system. The only way to  have a better health system for an ageing population is to have more health professionals and we put the  educational institutions in place to do just that.

DAVID SPEERS:

Thanks very much Wayne. We’ve done well. I think 27 questions from drought relief to gay marriage and…

TONY ABBOTT:

Do I get a brief summation?

DAVID SPEERS:

16

You do and even politician slang got in there as well. I’ll invite you now to make some closing remarks,  Tony Abbott.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, that’s right. It was much better than Question Time in Parliament, wasn’t it David? Because…

DAVID SPEERS:

It certainly was, sitting here.

TONY ABBOTT:

…the questions were good. At least the answers were brief. There were no 11 minute answers which  Queensland’s favourite Labor leader Kevin Rudd gave on one occasion in Parliament.

Look, very briefly can I just say thank you to all of you. I think that our political process is much enhanced  by gatherings like this. I think we’ve had a candid exchange. Some of you, obviously, don’t think that much  of me. That’s your right and I’ve had a chance to do my best, to put my best foot forward to you.

This campaign has got just two days to go and I am going to campaign continuously over the next two days  because I know that the Australian public do not lightly change the government. I know that you do not  lightly entrust the Prime Ministership to someone else. You need to know that I want it and I do and you  need to know that I will work for it, and I will. So starting at 7am tomorrow morning, it's a continuous  campaign, right through until Friday night, because I want to meet as many Australians as I possibly can. I  want the Australian people to know that I am ready to govern. That's what I intend to demonstrate over the  next 72 hours.

[ends]
