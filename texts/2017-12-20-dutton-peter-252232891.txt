E&EO…………………………………………………………………………………………..

KIM LANDERS:

Peter Dutton is the incoming Minister for Home Affairs and I spoke to him a short  time ago. Minister good morning.

PETER DUTTON:

Good morning Kim.

KIM LANDERS:

Is this ministerial reshuffle the reset the Government needs?

PETER DUTTON:

I think the Government's had a very positive conclusion to the year. I think the wins  in the two by-elections have been important. I think that fact that Mr Shorten really  copped a shellacking out of Bennelong is something that's rattled the Labor Party.  So the reshuffle adds to the momentum that the Government's got and there's a lot  that we want to do, not only in the national security space, but obviously in terms of  our economic message - helping families and jobs - and we very importantly want to  try and help families with their energy costs which is a big issue for families and  small businesses.

So there's a lot of good that comes out of the reshuffle and I'm very pleased that the  new Home Affairs portfolio is being created as part of that.

You're not worried that friction in the National Party ranks over the ministerial  reshuffle might be a distraction for the Government?

PETER DUTTON:

No. Look, I think there are always people that miss out within reshuffles, always  people that are promoted unexpectedly and in the end the Prime Minister and the  Deputy Prime Minister make decisions about who they believe will be best able to  deal with the issues that are important to the Government, important to the  Australian people and...

KIM LANDERS:

…because I'm wondering, I'm wondering you know, some of the Nats went rogue  recently over a banking Royal Commission; there have been some that have  criticised Malcolm Turnbull's leadership. Is there a lack of discipline in the Party?

PETER DUTTON:

No there's not. I think the Government is very focused, as I say, on those three very  important priorities; in my case Home Affairs - bringing together the agencies that  will serve Australia well, to keep Australians as safe as humanly possible. There's a  big organised crime piece that we need to invest more in.

So there's a lot of work that you'll see rolling out in 2018, not only in this portfolio, as  I say, but within the economic portfolios as well.

KIM LANDERS:

Just one other question about party matters though. There's a report in The  Australian newspaper that senior members of the LNP, including the former  Queensland Premier, Campbell Newman, have been asked to consider resigning  because they've been openly criticising the party.

As a senior Queensland member, do you support that?

PETER DUTTON:

I leave any of those party issues to the organisations, whether it's in Queensland or  elsewhere, it's an issue for the organisation.

But I think, you know, the focus for us today is on making sure that we can explain to  Australians the virtue in setting up, in my case, the Home Affairs portfolio because by  bringing together our intelligence, law enforcement and border agencies we deal with  the reality of the threat in the terror space, within the organised crime space, but  across Government otherwise...

…sorry to interrupt. When we spoke about your new portfolio in July, I was asking  how this shakeup, how much it was going to cost. You didn't have an estimate then;  it was in the very early days. Do you have an idea now about how much it's costing,  bringing this all together?

PETER DUTTON:

Well Kim, I think what's important is that the agencies, at the moment, retain their  autonomy. So the Australian Federal Police, ASIO, etc, will still be autonomous, but  they will come within the Home Affairs portfolio. So there'll be greater strategic join-up.

There will be minimal costs around the usual sorts of changes when you have a  change of department, but it will be insignificant compared to the amount that we're  investing in keeping Australians safe and the fact that we've had, now, the 81st  person since 2014 charged with a terror related offence, I think says to Australians  that we face a very real risk - as people do in the United Kingdom, or the United  States, or Canada, or in any other Western democracy…

KIM LANDERS:

…so let me ask you, sorry, let me ask you about that case.

PETER DUTTON:

Sure.

KIM LANDERS:

You'll be in charge of federal police and intelligence agencies. A 25-year-old Sydney  man has become the first Australian charged with foreign incursion offences for  allegedly fighting in Syria in 2015. You've been briefed on that?

PETER DUTTON:

I have, yes.

KIM LANDERS:

What are you able to tell us?

PETER DUTTON:

Well, it's obviously a matter that now is before the courts, but there's been a long-run  investigation and there was an offence created that said if people went to a  proscribed area - that is, if they went to an area within that warzone that had been  proscribed under the Act - then they'd committed an offence and obviously, this is a

matter that was alleged to have taken place in 2015 and this 25-year old has been  charged. So again, I think it demonstrates the work of ASIO, the Australian Federal  Police, New South Wales Police, in this case, but there is a very close collaboration  and I am hoping under the Home Affairs portfolio that we can bring those agencies  even closer together because the fact is, as we saw only a few months ago, people  are trying to bring down airplanes, they're trying to disrupt places of mass-gathering,  and over this Christmas-new year break, we want to do everything within in our  power to keep Australians safe and secure.

The Prime Minister in setting up this portfolio has given me that responsibility.

KIM LANDERS:

One of those agencies, Australian Border Force, the boss, Roman Quaedvlieg has  been on leave for some months. He is under investigation. Do you expect him to  return to that job?

PETER DUTTON:

Well it’s an issue for the proper independent authority that is investigating that matter  at the moment, so I don't seek to pre-empt that one way or the other. It's an issue for  ACLEI and we will wait and see what their recommendation is and the Government  will respond accordingly.

But I mean the focus for the Australian Border Force over the break is to get people  quickly through airports, to deal with the one per cent of people that we have a  concern with at the airports and still allow people easy travel both in and out of  Australia as they travel both domestically and internationally.

There's a lot of great work that ABF has done over the course of the last 12 months  and I should take the opportunity to say thank you to all of those officers across all of  the agencies that will work when we are all on holidays over Christmas. These  people will be working around the clock to keep us safe and we are happy to focus  on that.

KIM LANDERS:

Okay. On the immigration side of your portfolio; last week it was confirmed just over  200 refugees from Manus Island and Nauru had been approved to be resettled in the  US. When will they be flying to the States?

PETER DUTTON:

Over the coming weeks and obviously months, beyond that, there will be others that  will be able to leave Manus and Nauru and go to the United States...

KIM LANDERS:

…do you know when that next group might be approved?

PETER DUTTON:

Well they'll be uplifted within, I believe, within the next few weeks - but that's an  issue for the United States - obviously they've got all of the logistics to work out.

So, I think the important thing here Kim is that, as I've said before, I didn't put people  on Manus or Nauru. I want to get people off and we're doing that as quickly as  possible and the United States deal that was brokered by the Prime Minister and the  then-President Obama when he was in Office is going to pay dividends, and it will  help us take people off Manus as quickly as possible and that's certainly the  Government's desire.

KIM LANDERS:

Minister, thank you very much for speaking with AM.

PETER DUTTON:

Thanks Kim, have a great Christmas. Thank you.
