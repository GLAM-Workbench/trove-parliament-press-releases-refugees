ABC Mornings Tasmania   With Leon Compton  Tuesday 11 June



Subjects: Leadership, Macquarie Harbour Aquaculture Hub



LEON COMPTON: Senior ALP figures acknowledge the talk around leadership of the  federal party is happening at the moment, but will there be a change? At least three of the  four Tasmanian ALP members in the Lower House hold their seats by less than the  predicted margin for defeat in the September federal election. Is the removal of Julia  Gillard the answer? It's a question a lot of people asking this morning.    Sid Sidebottom is the Parliamentary Secretary for Fisheries and Forestry, and also  the Federal Member for Braddon. He is one of those people whose margin for victory at  the last election sits inside the margin for projected defeat now. Sid Sidebottom, good  morning to you.  SID SIDEBOTTOM: Good morning Leon, lovely day on the Coast.  LEON COMPTON: What conversations are being had about the leadership at the  moment? Paul Howes, Craig Emerson say they're happening, what are you hearing?  SID SIDEBOTTOM: Well I'm not hearing anything except through the media, certainly no  one's discussing anything with me, and most people that I know are going about their  business as they should and, you know, a lot of this chatter that's going on gets replicated  in the media so it sounds like an avalanche.  LEON COMPTON: It's chatter that's now coming from members of your own party of  course, Craig Emerson says that conversations about leadership are being had.  SID SIDEBOTTOM: Well, I don't know what conversations Craig is privy to, I know that  there is a rump that have never been satisfied with the decisions - three decisions that  we've had, and they continue. But what you hear in the media, Leon, is a Labor source, a  female Labor MP, unnamed said this, someone said that, so this gets replicated  throughout all the syndicates, we don't have that many in the end, and it just sounds like  an avalanche.   Most of the members that I know are going about their business. That's what we're  paid to do, that's what we should be doing and we have a good story to tell Leon and that's  what I'll be doing.  LEON COMPTON: The story that you're telling at the moment sees you at seven and a  half per cent margin, holding your seat from victory at the last election, facing defeat at this  one. You're comfortable with that?  SID SIDEBOTTOM: Well, I mean - you know, I can only deal with what I'm dealing with at  the moment. And you know, polls predict one thing, you know - reality is another and, you  know, I'm paid to do a job, I'm doing that job. And particularly in Braddon, and Tasmania  more generally, the Labor Party has invested a great deal and we have terrific policies that  [indistinct] play out to the benefit of Tasmania whether it's the NBN, the NDIS, or whether  it's our education reforms, just to name three.

And also on top of that we've brought this country through a very difficult period  internationally and financially. Now those challenges still exist to a great extent. So that is  a good record, so the chatter goes on. You know, when I really try to pinpoint what it is that  people are upset about, you know, after you have a discussion beyond 30 seconds they  can't tell you.  LEON COMPTON: Isn't part of the issue that they don't feel within the party itself that Julia  Gillard is capable of making the arguments for the achievements that you have pointed to  there?  SID SIDEBOTTOM: Well, there are a lot of ways of communicating, and it's important that,  you know, you be able to get clear air to be able to communicate things. Now, we've had a  campaign, and no one can deny this, the campaign by News Limited has been  extraordinary in this country. And of course it syndicates right throughout the media cycle.  So that's one of the issues we've dealt with and if anyone says that's an unbiased  approach by News Limited, then I'll fly.   And the other thing is that we've also got a negative, very negative, Opposition. So  we have things going on, and when you try to advance through a difficult parliamentary  system at the moment with the minority, when you try to advance things for the betterment  of the country and good policy, such as - unfortunately the asylum seeker issue, and the  Malaysia solution, these are knocked back as well. So…  LEON COMPTON: Mr Sidebottom you're facing the prospect of losing your job on 14  September this year, why aren't you talking about changing leadership when the  suggestions are that Kevin Rudd will give you a better chance of victory?  SID SIDEBOTTOM: Well again, who's making the suggestions? Are they realistic? And  what is the reality? The reality for me is we have a good record, we have a good story to  tell and we have good policies. What has Tony Abbott got? What's the alternative got? No  one's discussing it, you're not discussing it, I notice we get very little discussion on a  number of programs about what the Opposition stand for and what they're going do, Leon.   So I can only deal with the realities of what I've got and what we'll be doing.  Changing leaders is not going to change that.  LEON COMPTON: Well, it's because I think many in the community at the moment are  looking at a party walking towards defeat and wonder if they will do something to reduce  the scale of that defeat.  SID SIDEBOTTOM: Well, let's get into the campaign proper. Let's have a proper debate  about policy and about our record and let the media concentrate on that instead of the  chatter from a small group of people which gets amplified and replicated and then  becomes an avalanche in the media, and start making the Opposition, who appear to be -  are going to become the alternative government or the Government, then ask them what  their policies are. Malcolm Turnbull, last night at Q+A, I mean, his performance on the  asylum seeker issue and turning back the boats tells you exactly what they're really like,  and do it again with NBN, do it again with education, do it again with other policies in  relation to social policies, and you'll start to see the realities, and Australians will have a  choice.  LEON COMPTON: Do you feel that your seat would be safer if Kevin Rudd were the  leader of the ALP?  SID SIDEBOTTOM: I'm sorry, is my seat safer with…?  LEON COMPTON: Do you feel that you would be in with a better chance of retaining your  seat if Kevin Rudd were installed as leader of the ALP?  SID SIDEBOTTOM: Look, I don't have people rushing up to me saying Sid, we're going to  vote for you if Kevin Rudd becomes leader. That's just nonsense. People want a proper  political debate in this country and I only wish we could have this and if the media could

aid this by actually discussing real issues instead of just replicating chatter which is  brought out by News Limited and everyone else runs off.  LEON COMPTON: Do you think the ALP can win the coming election with Julia Gillard as  leader?  SID SIDEBOTTOM: Yes, we can win the next election, and we have the policies to do that,  and I only wish we could debate that instead of all this nonsense [indistinct].  LEON COMPTON: Why is it that when people are polled it seems that they are so far from  agreeing with you in those sentiments?  SID SIDEBOTTOM: Look, I don't know how the polls are conducted, Leon, and I think if  things are replicated in the media like they are, then they think this is all the Labor Party is  on about. I am in that Caucus, and I'm telling you the caucus and the great majority want  to get on with this, and I'm asking people in the Caucus if they've got nothing positive to  say, then maintain a noble silence like the Buddha suggested.  LEON COMPTON: Craig Emerson says there are conversations going on at the moment  but nothing is changing. You're saying you're in the Caucus, but you're not hearing any of  that.  SID SIDEBOTTOM: I hear the same chatter from the same people, Leon. That's what I'm  trying to say, and the majority of the Caucus are going about their business. Nothing helps  unity more than people consolidating and solidifying and acting as one. All I'm asking -  these people that appear to be disappointed with where we're at, to actually get on with  their jobs and button their lips.  LEON COMPTON: How do you resolve this issue?  SID SIDEBOTTOM: People doing their job and buttoning their lips. And, I mean, today I'm  announcing a major, major investment in Tasmania's economy, and yet you and I have  been discussing for the last five minutes about the possibility of changing the leadership  because of the chatter of a few individuals.  LEON COMPTON: We're discussing that because it's an issue where people wonder what  the ALP might do next. You've already changed the leader of your party once. There has  been the Simon Crean failed attempt earlier in this year, and people are asking  themselves, well, is this a credible party for running what is a billion - multi-billion dollar  economy?  SID SIDEBOTTOM: Well, again, I'm saying to you, it's the same rump demonstrating their  disappointment each time, and every time the media run off with it, replicate it, then make -  amplify it, and then it becomes an avalanche, and using that…  LEON COMPTON: You say it's News Limited…  SID SIDEBOTTOM: …[indistinct] the main thing going on, Leon.  LEON COMPTON: You say it's News Limited running this, but you would also be aware  that Fairfax polling suggests similar things, that Antony Green, in a recent analysis of  Tasmania and where it's heading, has made some pretty damning assessments of the  future of the Labor Party in Tasmania, the way that the polls are indicated at the moment.  SID SIDEBOTTOM: Leon, if you replicate and amplify it often enough, then that's what  people think that's all we do, and of course they will react to that. I'm saying to you we've  got many good Caucus people going about their business, and I would ask those that if  they're dissatisfied with whom their choice of the leader should be, then get on with your  job, button your lips, right, and do what is right for this country, and that is first and  foremost talk about the things we've done, we're going to do, and then I ask everyone else  to ask the Opposition what are you going to do? And nobody is asking.  LEON COMPTON: Sid Sidebottom, you had Kevin Rudd down for a quiz night earlier in  the year. Would Julia Gillard have got the same response from the crowd as Kevin Rudd if  she had been attending the quiz, rather than him?

Transcript             Page 4

SID SIDEBOTTOM: Well, I'm sure she would've. It's just a bit hard to get the Prime  Minister to come and do my quiz.  LEON COMPTON: The popularity of Kevin Rudd that you saw that night, you don't think  might suggest that he's better received in your electorate than others?  SID SIDEBOTTOM: Oh, Leon, seriously, I just - I mean, you know, if I could've had the  Prime Minister there we would've, and we would've had a full house and had a really  successful night like we did with Kevin.  LEON COMPTON: On ABC local radio around Tasmania, Sid Sidebottom's our guest this  morning, Parliamentary Secretary for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and the Federal  Member for Braddon. Sid Sidebottom, today $7 million for - as part of a doubling of fish  farming on the West Coast of Tasmania. How many jobs come with that?  SID SIDEBOTTOM: Well, terrific to be able to discuss it, Leon. Look, be about 100 jobs in  the construction sites and at least 160 to 200 jobs when it gets underway by about 2016.  So it's fantastic news, and it's an industry that can really grow. And the other great thing  about it, of course, is that, apart from its real importance to Tasmania and its economy, is it  adds to the diversification of the economy of the West Coast, so looking at mining, looking  at tourism, and now aquaculture. So very, very important.  LEON COMPTON: Will there be processing of those fish on the West Coast as part of this  expansion?  SID SIDEBOTTOM: Well, again, it's to be determined by the proponents, but of course  processing already takes place on the North West Coast, so there may be transportation  up to the North West as well.  LEON COMPTON: Appreciate you talking with us this morning.  SID SIDEBOTTOM: Oh, I'm really glad I could talk about the fantastic announcement of  $7.1 million.  LEON COMPTON: I think it's interesting that you think that people aren't at the moment  studying the way that your party's handling the leadership and your own capacity to get  clean air to talk about the policy achievements that you want to point to.  SID SIDEBOTTOM: Well, I'm sure you'll be able to help to do that then, Leon.  LEON COMPTON: I don't think it's our job. It's our job to look at you and how you're  handling your business in the lead-up to our federal election. Don't you think that's fair?  SID SIDEBOTTOM: Well, you can commentate as much as you like on that, Leon. I'm just  going about my business, and I ask that the media also put the Opposition on trial and  start discussing matters of substance.  LEON COMPTON: You're a man who's facing the prospect of packing your bags after this  election, and you don't seem to think that talking about the leadership and a possible  change there to somebody who, polls indicate, may be more popular and give you a  chance, is a conversation worth having?  SID SIDEBOTTOM: Well, we've just had, you know, 10 or 15 minutes of it, Leon. I'm just  saying to you I've got a job to do, and that's what I'll be doing.  LEON COMPTON: Good to talk to you this morning.  SID SIDEBOTTOM: Bye.
