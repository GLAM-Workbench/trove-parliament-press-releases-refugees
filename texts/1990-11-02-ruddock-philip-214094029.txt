AUSTRALIA 2000 PUBLIC MEETING  A GREAT SUCCESS!

"Creating a More Productive Economy" was the theme of the first  Australia 2000 public meeting hosted by local Federal Member for  Dundas, Philip Ruddock. Guest speaker was Senator Jim Short,  Shadow Minister for Finance and Liberal Senator for Victoria.

The meeting was held at Eastwood Senior Citizens Centre, on  Tuesday evening, 30th October, beginning at 7.30pm.

The purpose of the evening, as outlined by Chairman, John

Hartigan, a local Epping resident and Dundas Federal Conference  President, was for the two Shadow Ministers present to soak up  the views of local residents on the topic and together discuss

realistic solutions to the problems raised.

Philip Ruddock is Shadow Minister for Immigration and Senator  Short is Shadow Minister for Finance.

The principle outcomes of the meeting were as follows: :

FEDERAL AND STATE RELATIONS:

As has been reported in the media recently, there is much concern  about the apparent overlap between Federal and State Governments.   Much duplication and overlap between Federal and State Government  departments exists.

Senator Short, who, in addition to his role as Shadow Minister  for Finance, also assists the Opposition Leader on Commonwealth  and State Relations, agreed that there is great scope for getting  rid of duplication and unnecessary bureaucracy. Smaller  government and public service would result in a better and more  efficient economy, relying more on competition, productivity and  market forces.

Also of concern to the participants of the meeting was the

current fiscal imbalance between the Federal and State

Governments.

.  .  ./2

The Coalition are currently looking closely at how fiscal  equalisation could be met, whereby the States have access to the  proportionate amount of taxes required to fulfill their state

expenditure responsibilities.

MANAGEMENT:

Rigid union structures, heavy regulation and disputation  restricts productivity. To free up this process we need to  encourage greater communication and participation between  employers and employees.  We need to encourage privatisation in

industry where appropriate.

The fundamental flaw in the current system is that workers are  not able to share in in the benefits of their work output. If  there is an incentive to work harder, productivity is sure to  improve.

"In this way, Australia would get a second job, and the wheels  of the economy would again begin to turn", Philip Ruddock

commented.

The Coalition have a Micro Economic Reform policy which

encourages greater productivity. This is essential if we are to  survive economically.

ETHICS OF FEDERAL AND STATE PARLIAMENTS:

Concern was expressed by participants about the level of

behaviour by parliamentarians at both the Federal and: State  levels. It was suggested that the Members of Parliament improve  their behaviour and their standard of ethics in order that they  may again demand the public respect required to get on with

running the country.

Senator Short agreed that the behaviour and ethical standards of  parliament must be improved. John Hewson, when he first became  Opposition Leader made an undertaking that he was committed to  raising the standards of parliamentary ethics and performance.  Televising the proceedings in the House of Representatives would  also go far to ensure that parliament was indeed the "people's  house."

Other matters considered at the Australia 2000 meeting held on  Tuesday night were:

* The proposed OTC and TELECOM merger * Wheat sales and excess * The Waterfront * Community Consultation * Hardwood forests

'  advertisements. It was a very stimulating evening of discussion,  which I hope will continue as we hold further meetings.  It is  a very positive step to further open up the lines of

communication between me and my constituents", Philip Ruddock  commented.

REPORT ON AUSTRALIA 2000

"CREATING A MORE PRODUCTIVE ECONOMY"

MEETING HELD IN THE DUNDAS ELECTORATE

EASTWOOD SENIOR CITIZENS HALL, EASTWOOD

Tuesday, 30th October, 1990

INTRODUCTION:

"Creating a More Productive Economy" was the theme of the first  Australia 2000 public meeting hosted by local Federal Member for  Dunda", Philip Ruddock.  Guest speaker was Senator Jim Short,  Shadow Minister for Finance and Liberal Senator for Victoria.

The meeting was held at Eastwood Senior Citizens Centre,  on  Tuesday evening,. 30th October, beginning at 7.30pm.

The purpose of the evening, as outlined by Chairman, John

Hartigan, a local Epping resident and Dundas Federal Conference  President, was for the two Shadow Ministers present to soak up  the views of local residents on the topic and together discuss  realistic solutions to the problems raised.

Philip Ruddock is Shadow Minister for Immigration and Senator  Short is Shadow Minister for Finance.

The main outcomes of the meeting, in the order in which they were  discussed, follow.

OTC AND TELECOM:

The merging of OTC and Telecom was deemed a mistake. Senator  Short called it a "MONSTERCOM".  The Liberal Federal Coalition  are opposed to the merger of Telecom and OTC and instead

recommend that Telecom, OTC and Aussat be privatised. In this  way all three companies would be far more efficient and cost  effective. The Coalition would also remove restraints to  competition, which would mean better service and cheaper rates.

2

WHEAT SALES:

The main problem facing the rural sector is the problem of the  subsidy war. Rural industries, in particular wheat sales are  suffering badly due to the heavily subsidised wheat from the  United States. The rural industries are being slaughtered by

inflation. Again the solution is to encourage greater cost  efficiency. It would also depend on the overseas markets and the  supply and demand.

THE WATERFRONT:

There is currently a no win situation on the waterfront, and the  Government is getting nowhere in waterfront reform. The role of  the unions in restraining productivity on the waterfront needs

to be redressed in order to create a more productive economy on  the waterfront.

One lady commented that in a recent visit to Japan, for the first  time ever she felt ashamed to be an Australian. This must not  go on. It was pointed out by Senator Short that privatisation  of the waterfront would lessen the role of the unions and would  encourage far greater productivity.

"The evening was a great success, with many people attending in  response to our recent letterbox drop and newspaper

advertisements. It was a very stimulating evening of discussion,  which I hope will, continue as we hold further meetings. It is  a very positive step to further open up the lines of

communication between me and my valued constituents", Philip  Ruddock commented.

FEDERAL STATE RELATIONS:

It was pointed out that the Labor Government have increased the  number of Federal Public Servants in areas previously containing  only a few. This exemplifies the obvious waste through

duplication and overlap, in having employees at both Federal and  State levels.

Such areas which have experienced growth in employment at the  Federal level include education and health.  Both of these areas  are well covered by State departments.

Senator Short agreed that there is a lot of scope for getting rid  of duplication and unnecessary bureacracy.  Smaller government  and public service would result in a better and more efficient  economy, relying more on competition, productivity and market

forces.

MANAGEMENT:

Rigid union structures and disputation restricts productivity.   To free up this process we need to encourage greater workforce  and employee participation and communication.  Negotiation and  communication between employers and employees is currently

inhibited by the union structure and heavy regulation. We need  to encourage communication and participation within the  privatisation programme where appropriate.

A fundamental flaw in the current system is that workers are not  ’  able to share in the benefits of their work/produce. If there  is an incentive to produce, such as sharing in the benefits,  productivity is sure to improve.

In this way, as Philip Ruddock commented, "Australia would get  a second job, and the wheels of the economy would again begin to  turn."

The Coalition have a comprehensive Micro Economic Reform Policy  which encourages greater productivity.  This is essential if we  are to survive economically.

ETHICS OF FEDERAL AND STATE PARLIAMENTS:

Concern has been directed at the current level of behaviour in  both State and Federal Parliaments. It was stated by a member  of the community that he was disgusted with the current low level  of eth_cs displayed by Australian politicians.

Senator Short answered by saying that he agreed with the

gentleman, and pointed out that Dr John Hewson had made an

undertaking at the very beginning of his appointnment as

Opposition Leader that he was committed to raising the standards  of parliamentary ethics and performance. Philip Ruddock also  added that televising the proceedings in the House of

Representatives would certainly be a step in the right direction  in helping to raise the behavioural standards of Members of the  House of Representatives.  The Senate proceedings are already  being televised.

IMMIGRATION:

Immigration in Australia is a very sensitive issue. Philip  Ruddock, Shadow Minister for Immigration and our local Federal  Member, stated clearly at the outset of this section of

discussion that he was happy to answer any questions people had  on immigration. He made the point that immigration has a great  deal to do with the topic "Creating a More Productive Economy" -  if we manage our immigration programme well, we are bound to be  able to contribute more effectively to the overall productivity  of this country.

Also covered was the current fiscal imbalance which is currently  a cause of extensive discussion bewtween Federal and State  governments.  The Federal Coalition are currently looking very  closely at such questions as whether "tied grants", from Federal  to State are necessary, and how fiscal equalisation could be  realistically m e t .

COMMUNITY CONSULTATION:

Another member of the meeting said that she wished Dr John Hews on  *  to know that the community needs to be consulted.  Philip Ruddock  gave an assurance that all comments made at this meeting and the  meetings to follow would be forwarded, in a the form of a report,

to the Opposition Leader for consideration and implementation  where appropriate.

Another purpose of the Australia 2000 initiative is for the  Members to have a more broadbased understanding of what the  communty thinks. This is the most effective way of doing just  that.

So often, the Federal Member is not consulted unless a

constituent has a major problem involving the Federal Government,  and their need for their local Member's intervention. These  public meetings are directed also at those who may not

necessarily have large problems needing the assistance of the  Federal Member but also those who have been observing the state  of our nation and have formed opinions on what should be done  about it. It is through meetings such as this that such people  are able to both give their opinions and solutions to the

nation's problems, and also to get a feel for how other members  of their local area feel. It is also an opportunity to decide,  together, what can be done to change it.

"The Australia 2000 meetings, to be held over the next 12 months  or so, are an opportunity for all constituents concerned about  the future of this country, as I am, to express their views and  together, we can seek realistic and workable solutions. This  meeting was the first step in that process", Philip Ruddock said.

HARDWOOn FORESTS & SHORT TERM GOALS:

The question arose: why do we not plant hardwood forests? We  live in a country which demands short term solutions.  Hardwood  is a long term investment, and with interest rates the way they  are, no one is prepared to make such a long term commitment.

In wanting to create a more productive economy, all but could  only agree that there was greater need for commitment to long  term goals. The Australia 2000 idea, wanting to look beyond the  next election towards the Year 2000 was also indicative of the  Coalition's desire to have more long term objectives.

.  .  ./4

The main consideration when considering immigration in the  context of creating a more productive economy is that we need  people who will be able to significantly contribute to our  country, in order that we may reach the goal of greater

productivity and all the benefits associated with it. We need the  best people to make the best country.

We need people from other countries who will be more highly  skilled, educated and preferably younger.  In each immigration  category - concessional, family reunion, employer nomination and  independent entry, (except refugee and special humanitarian  ’  circumstances), such attributes would be looked on more

favourably under a Coalition Government.  Each application would  be assessed thoroughly on a case by case basis, through the  points system, keeping within the limits of the numbers set down  in the immigration programme. One would also need to consider  the implications of immigration in terms of its effects on

infrastructure and on the health and welfare systems.

Spouse entry is another area of concern.  It appears that there  has been a significant increase in the number of spouse entry  permits, and one wonders whether some come purely for immigration  reasons, rather than the marriage relationship.  This programme  would need to be more carefully monitored in order that

Immigration entry is not manipulated. .

In terms of compassionate cases, the Coalition has an ongoing  commitment to those who are in real and desperate need. They  would be watchful, however, of those trying to manipulate the  system.

UNITED NATIONS CONVENTION ON THE RIGHTS OF THE CHILD:

Concern was expressed about the Convention and the fact that it  had been supported by the Government and Opposition without  consulting the Australian Public.

Philip Ruddock said that under this Convention, children who were  abused or exploited, such as in the case of children in war for  example, would be protected.

It does not mean that parents would lose their rights, but rather  to protect children from abuse. Parents still have the rights  and responsibilities of raising their children in a responsible  framework, such as that prevalent in the Australian society and  culture.

But there is a need for us to accept minimum standards, for those  special circumstances where children need to be protected by the  state.  The Coalition supports ratification, but with some  reservations.

.  .  ./6

ESSO/MOBIL, PETROL PRICING & THE PETROL STRIKES:

Industrial relations are breaking down in this country. The  recent petrol stikes, yet another spate of union interruption  again indicates the need for change to the industrial relations  policy. Senator Short said that there should be far greater  reliance on the processes of the law in order that there would  be far tougher penalties for the interruption of services so  vital for the productivity of our country from day to day.

It has also been suggested that, through less voluntary unionism  ’  and less reliance on unions, such negotiations would be

obtainable without strikes or disputations.  In the most recent  series of strikes, John Howard commented that the issue at hand  was one that could have been resolved across the negotiation  table.

In terms of petrol pricing, the point was raised that Australia  is 70% self sufficient in oil, and yet our prices are still

reliant on overseas pricing trends - why is this so? Senator  Short replied by saying that oil pricing is an area determined  by the market system. If Australia were to have significantly  lower prices for their oil, they would not receive their desired  profit return.

Also, the net impact on the economy of having lower oil prices  would be unknown.  It would certainly be detrimental in the long  term and we would not maintain our oil sufficiency.

WHEAT EXCESS:

A  suggestion as to what to do with our excess wheat was put

forward. We should do as the New Zealanders do and make the

excess wheat into alcohol to mix with our petrol to make our  petrol go further.  A member of the meeting said that we should  keep a clear and realistic perspective on the oil industry.

He also said that we should concentrate not on the things we  cannot do but on the things that we can do in Australia.

This gentleman suggested many of the inventions that we see on  "Beyond 2000" as ways to build a more productive economy.

Philip Ruddock replied by saying that unfortunately due to such  factors as high interest rates and the current problems faced by  small business and manufacturing, people are not willing to take  up new ideas, and new inventions. We have a short term vision  and a current economy which does not encourage growth and

diversity. Such an example is the introduction of the electric  car. The electric car is ready for manufacturing, and yet no one  will take up the challenge. Manufacturers cannot afford the  outlay or the risk.

CREDIT CREATION:

The question was asked: why do we have such crippling interest  rates if the banks are able to create credit and money at no

cost? Why can't we have an interest free society? This is all  tied in with our massive national debt and the reason why

Australia is in such a crisis situation economically. Why not  do as was suggested in "The Story of the Commonwealth Bank?"

Senator Short replied that money is a commodity and must be  bought at a price.  Interest serves as that price.  If we were  ’to have an interest rate free society, it would create a

situation where all money would be under the control of a

government dictate - as opposed to market determination, which  is what the Coalition favours.

The power of the government, in the situation where all the  decision making were to be handed over to them, would thus be  increased, and the credit creation would be entirely the

responsibility of this government dictate. You cannot have an  interest rate free society - no one else operates under such a  system. It is unrealistic.  Senator Short and the questioner  agreed to disagree.

The massive overseas debt in the future of this country depends  on two things: the creation of wealth (through natural resources  and the like) and on productivity. This is the essence of the  economic future of this country.

FOREIGN OWNERSHIP & REAL ESTATE:

According two another gentleman at the meeting, there is a  greater volume of money going into real estate, by overseas  investors. It was suggested that we should tighten up the flow  of money into and out of the country in order to get back on the  track to recovery. It was stated also that we are becoming an

"enslaved people" - slaves to foreign ownership.

Philip Ruddock replied by saying that the Department of

Immigration had investigated cases in which it was suspected that  the money from the real estate was going overseas. Six cases  have been reported correctly and have been stopped. Any further  cases for investigation are welcome.

SOCIAL AND FAMILY ISSUES:

It was mentioned that we had not discussed the people behind the  economics. Both Senator Short and Philip Ruddock assured those  in attendance that there would be future meetings in 1991

covering the following topics:

* "Building a Better Society" (January - March) * "Improving and Protecting our Environment" (April -June) .  .  ./8

8

* "Australia and the World" (July - August)

The breakdown of the family unit was discussed briefly as one of  the major factors of the breakdown of society. This will be  discussed in future meetings.

THERE IS HOPE:

The very appropriate closing remarks came from a younger member  of the audience who said that there is HOPE for our country, our  economic future, our moral and spiritual values. Ã¢ÂÂ

Senator Short concluded his remarks by saying that yes we do have  undeniable problems, but there are SOLUTIONS and we need to  participate in bringing about change together. It is no use  blaming the Government or blaming the unions, we need to work

together to ensure that our children and our children's children  can look forward to a brighter and more productive future in  Australia.
