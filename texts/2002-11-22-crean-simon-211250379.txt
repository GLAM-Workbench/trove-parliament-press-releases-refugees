LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION

SPEECH BY THE LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION THE HON SIMON CREAN MP FABIAN SOCIETY MELBOURNE FRIDAY 22 NOVEMBER 2002

The Fabian Society and the Labor tradition

Thank you for the invitation to address the Fabian Society.

In the last 12 months we have seen just about every Shadow Minister address the Fabian Society. To my recollection this is a dramatic change. Labor Shadows used to be more often seen addressing CEDA or the Sydney Institute or the BCA.  This is  a  great  development  because  it’s  about  getting  the  party  members  and supporters involved again in policy development - which is one of the goals of the party reforms I have made.  It’s about reconnecting with our base and good Labor ideas.

Over the next couple of weeks we will be celebrating the thirtieth anniversary of the election of the Whitlam Government.  The Fabian Society was heavily involved in  the  development  of  Gough’s  great  reform  program,  which  changed  Australia forever.   Race  Matthews  in  particular  had  a  central  role  and  served  in  Gough’s caucus.  So as we celebrate our victory in 1972, we celebrate the contribution of people like Race and the many, many other Fabians who worked so hard to make it happen.

As  everyone  knows,  the  Fabians  are  named  after  the  Roman  General,  Quintus Fabius Maximus, who led Rome in its war with the Carthaginian General, Hannibal. His nickname was derived from the Latin word for delaying - ‘Cunctator’ - not the sort of name you want to try to pronounce after a few beer or glasses of wine at a dinner like this.

Despite this, the story of Fabius - I’ll call him that, not his nickname - is perhaps instructive.   During  his  struggle  against  Hannibal,  Fabius  was  always  being criticised for not rushing into battle at every opportunity.  He’d seen his generals destroyed time after time by his opponents when they’d adopted a hairy-chested approach and attacked without thinking first.  Fabius believed in a more strategic approach.  He was resistant to the quick fix and rightly ignored the critics of his

day.   But  he  was  determined  to  win.  He  had  one  policy  -  defeat  Hannibal  and save Rome.  Nothing would shift him from it.  He won.

There’s  a  lesson  for  Labor  today.   Just  as  Fabius  defeated  Hannibal,  who  was considered  invincible  in  his  day,  we  will  defeat  Howard  -  or  Costello,  should  he ever replace him - and save Australia from their right-wing agenda.  We will do this by fighting our opponents on our issues, in our way.  We will not be shifted.

Our first twelve months.

It’s been a tough 12 months in opposition.  Opposition is always hard, especially after 3 consecutive defeats.  And it’s even tougher when the domestic agenda is crowded out by security issues.

Let’s look at the last twelve months.  There have been two distinct phases.

The first was marked by the election of a Shadow Ministry full of new talent; the kids  overboard  affair;  the  attempt  by  the  Prime  Minister  to  embarrass  Justice Kirby; the Hollingworth fiasco; and Labor’s successful criticism of a federal budget that  attacked  the  most  vulnerable  people  in  our  society.   Those  measures  still haven’t passed the Senate thanks to our principled stand.

The first half of the year was also marked by important new Labor commitments: Ã¢ÂÂ¢ A population policy for Australia; Ã¢ÂÂ¢ A more compassionate approach to asylum seekers; Ã¢ÂÂ¢ On a commissioner to protect our children from child sex abuse; Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Four year fixed terms for the parliament and an independent speaker; Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Paid maternity leave; Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Giving every Australian the chance to own assets; Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Community Safety Zones to tackle crime; Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Engagement with Asia; Ã¢ÂÂ¢ And a visit to China to lay the basis for a new partnership with China - an

old friend of Australia and Labor.

The second half of the year started with internal party reform.  This reform was essential  to  tackling  branch  stacking  and  creating  a  more  inclusive,  open  and democratic  party.   It  involved  tough  decisions  and  shifted  much  of  the  public’s focus onto our internal processes.  It was difficult for us but we simply had to do it.  The Party’s failure to make these reforms much earlier contributed significantly to the poor outcome in Cunningham.

Then the Bali bombing took place, and turned the electorate’s focus again back to security issues.  This political environment clearly suits incumbents.

Despite this, we have continued to put out policies: Ã¢ÂÂ¢ On manufacturing; Ã¢ÂÂ¢ On innovation in industry; Ã¢ÂÂ¢ On improving superannuation;

3

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ And on improving corporate governance standards.

The  way  forward  for  Labor  is  to  engage  with  the  electorate  with  constructive proposals  for  national  security  and  to  have  a  strong  domestic  agenda  which identifies  the  problems  people  are  facing,  the  pressures  they  under  and  the solutions to them.

You get my drift.

I don’t want us to just oppose; I want us to propose - with a message that will resonate with the Australian people.

It  resonated  in  the  first  half  of  this  year,  and  when  we  get  clear  air  to  focus people’s minds on the domestic agenda, it will again.

My values and beliefs.

We  need  to  have  a  strong  position  on  security  issues  because  they  are  so important, and I will come back to them later in my speech.

But I want to deal now with the next couple of years in the lead up to the next election.

I also want to deal with the values and beliefs that underpin my leadership of the Labor Party.

Three  things  differentiate  us  from  our  opponents:  tolerance,  fairness  and opportunity for all, not just the lucky few.

A strong economy for a fair society…

The major debate between left and right today isn’t so much about how we create wealth, it’s about how we distribute it.

That’s  why  in  the  1980s  as  leader  of  the  trade  union  movement  I  supported reforms to create a stronger Australian economy - not as an end in itself, but to create more wealth for everyone to share, not just the lucky few.

Those reforms led to the introduction of superannuation for everyone.  They lifted the  real  disposable  incomes  of  low  to  middle  income  earners.   They  created  a more diversified economy through better trade and industry policies and created jobs.

I want a strong economy, but I want it for a fair society.

A sustainable economy…

I don’t just want a stronger economy, I want a sustainable economy as well.

As  Shadow  Treasurer  I  recognised  that  environmental  sustainability  was  a mainstream economic issue.  I recognised that growth must be economically and environmentally sustainable, and that issues like land and water management and greenhouse emissions can no longer be treated as sideshows.

Our continent is fragile.  We are its custodians.  And we have a responsibility to future  generations  to  preserve  our  environment  as  much  as  we  have  a responsibility to create future economic prosperity.

I  will  use  COAG  in  a  new  way.   Through  a  heads  of  government  and  whole  of governments approach COAG will find a solution to the salinity and land clearing crises, will improve water and drought management, and will curtail greenhouse emissions.  I am committed to ending the buckpassing that is preventing Australia from  solving  these  problems.   That’s  why  a  new  commitment  to  national cooperation is essential.

We can’t just deal with issues of sustainability as a nation.  They require a global response.  That’s why I will ratify the Kyoto Protocol.  It’s the best international framework to achieve such a solution and it’s in our interests to sign it.

It’s good for the environment, it’s good for Australia and it’s good for jobs.

Australia must have a seat at the table in the creation of a sustainable planet.

By  not  ratifying  the  Protocol,  John  Howard  is  also  denying  Australian  industries access to the emerging market for tradeable credits.

It’s  absurd  that  a  party  supposedly  so  committed  to  the  free  market  is  dealing Australia out of this market.

Six years of Howard has changed Australia - for the worse…

John Howard has no agenda to implement important reforms such as these.

His speech on Wednesday night was meant to outline a third-term agenda, but all that it demonstrated was that he has run out of puff.

It  was  pathetic.   It  contained  no  new  policies  and  no  long-term  strategies  to change  Australia  for  the  better.   Just  ten  committees,  taskforces,  trials  and reviews.

5

Under  his  leadership  Australia  will  continue  to  become  a  country  we  won’t recognise  just  a  few  years  from  now.   It  will  be  a  less  tolerant  nation,  a  more divided nation, and a nation less engaged with our region.

Just look at the changes for the worse that we’ve seen in the last six years.

Families are under increasing financial pressure, and no wonder.

Under this government we’re paying more tax than ever before.

The  Australian  people  now  know  one  crucial  thing  about  this  government;  they are the party of high taxes.

Peter Costello never saw a new tax he didn’t like.

Consumer credit and household debt are at record levels.

Australians now owe twice what they owed in 1996.

Young people can’t afford to buy a home any more.

The Howard Government’s housing bubble is pricing too many Australians out of the housing market.

Buying a home is now taking an extra 14 months of average wages.

Health costs have gone through the roof and bulk billing is disappearing.

It’s  no  wonder  people  are  putting  off  starting  a  family  and  are  being  forced  to work longer hours to make ends meet.

It’s  ironic  that  the  country  that  pioneered  the  8-hour  day  now  has  the  second longest working hours of any country in the world - behind only South Korea.

Middle-income jobs are disappearing.

Over the past three years, the Government has created only 700 jobs that earn average wages.

Retirement incomes have stagnated.

The superannuation agenda has not been advanced at all in the last six years.

Job security is being destroyed by the Coalition’s industrial relations changes.

And  if  you  lose  your  job,  they  won’t  guarantee  you  100  percent  of  your entitlements, unless you work for John Howard’s brother, Stan.

Inequality is increasing.

6

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ While the banks are making record profits ($10.5 billion this year), ordinary people are paying record transaction fees (up by $804 million to $7.1 billion this year).

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ While farmers are waiting for decent phone coverage, Ziggy Switkowski is getting his own personal phone tower.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ While public schools are being starved, private schools are getting millions more and still putting up their fees - by an average of 8 percent this year alone.

It’s clear: this is a government of the wealthy, by the wealthy, for the wealthy.

Peter Costello tells us we’ve never been richer.  That might be the view from the Melbourne  Club,  but  it’s  not  the  view  from  the  kitchen  table  of  ordinary Australians.

John Howard wants to talk almost exclusively about security and migration issues for one reason.  By asking us to get mad at each other and at other nations he thinks  we’ll  stop  looking  at  him  and  asking,  why  are  our  taxes  are  the  highest they’ve ever been?  Why are we paying massive fees to the banks while they are recording record profits?  Why are we working longer hours when there’s so much unemployment?  Why can’t young people afford to buy a family home?  Why can’t we do something about the state of our rivers and our soils?

A big difference between Labor and Liberal is this: Whilst we’re both committed to fighting the war on terrorism, only Labor has a plan for the future of the country.

A better vision for Australia.

John Howard has changed Australia - for the worse.

I want to change it for the better

I want the economy to work for all of the people all of the time.  Not just a few of the people all of the time.

How do we use the stronger economy to create the fair society?

The disappearing middle…

I  want  to  address  the  problem  of  disappearing  middle  by  targeting  tax  cuts  at them through a system of tax credits.

Done properly it can address welfare to work problems and the costs associated with raising a family.

7

I  want  more  family-friendly  policies  so  that  people  are  not  forced  to  make  the choice between being a good parent and being a good employee.  They can be both.

John  Howard  makes  a  lot  of  noises  about  paid  maternity  leave,  but  he  has  no intention of doing anything about it.

We have already announced our commitment to paid maternity leave.  But if we are  to  seriously  face  up  to  the  challenge  of  balancing  work  and  family  life,  we must also improve childcare, improve kindergartens and early childhood education and improve workplace flexibility.

More affordable housing…

I want to rekindle the Australian dream of home ownership for everyone.

By  using  the  Commonwealth  State  Housing  Agreement  negotiations  with  the states  and  local  government  we  can  implement  new  policies  to  make  housing more affordable.  Policies like those we have already floated:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Encouraging  superannuation  funds  to  invest  in  affordable  housing  for average-income earning families.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Matched  Savings  Accounts  that  match,  dollar-for-dollar,  the  savings  that low income earners make towards saving for a house.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ And Nest  Egg  Accounts  that  provide  a  lump  sum  for  children  from  low-income families to give them capital that they can put to their education, starting a business or saving for a home when they turn 18.

And we can also implement policies that will improve the liveability and security of our  communities  through  ideas  like  community  safety  zones  and  better  cities programs.

Taking superannuation forward again…

I want to further improve our superannuation system as our population ages and there is an increasing tendency to retire earlier.

Labor spread superannuation to the whole of the workforce and we will improve it for the whole workforce.

Improving our public health system…

I want to improve our public health system.

Bulk billing is in freefall - down from 80 percent in 1996 to 71.2 percent today.

Without bulk billing there is no Medicare.

John  Howard  once  said  he  wanted  stab  Medicare  through  the  heart.   Now  it’s death by a thousand cuts.

When she visited Australia in 1996 as the First Lady, Hillary Clinton said something at the Opera House that we should never forget: "hang on to your Medicare; it's the best scheme I have ever seen.”

We  will  not  only  hang  on  to  it,  we  will  restore  bulk  billing  and  strengthen Medicare.

The key is education.

Underpinning  all  of  these  initiatives  has  to  be  a  national  recommitment  to education and skill development.

Education and skills are the great liberators of individuals and the great civilisers of societies.

They  lay  the  basis  of  greater  tolerance  and  compassion  -  two  values  seriously lacking in the ranks of the Howard Government.

My objective is to see every child achieve the equivalent of a year-12 qualification.

We need to be innovative in how we achieve it and much more responsive to our children’s needs and problems.

Our children must be given a choice between a job, a university or TAFE place or some other form of structured training.  Unemployment must not be an option.

Gough Whitlam talked about his ambition 30 years ago to ensure that every child had a desk with a lamp on it.  Today my objective is to  equip that desk with a lamp and a computer.

It’s not just about helping young people.

That’s  why  I  am  committed  to  making  lifelong  learning  a  reality  for  everyone through ideas such as learning accounts.

Access for all to the benefits of the information age must be our objective.  It is the bridge to the future.

To  do  this  we  must  upgrade  our  telecommunications  infrastructure  and  connect the nation.

9

It’s a key reason for keeping Telstra in public ownership.

But enormous potential also exists in our other significant public institutions - our schools,  TAFE  colleges,  tertiary  institutions,  post  offices,  libraries  and  our  ABC. Through broadband and fast speed Internet connections we can use them to the benefit of the whole community and expand lifelong learning opportunities even further.

The  Liberals  have  spent  the  last  six  years  opening  doors  for  the  favoured  few, slamming them in the face of those without money and privilege.

They did it by under-investing in our public schools.  They want to do it again with their proposal to deregulate university fees.

My  leadership  will  be  dedicated  to  unlocking  the  doors  to  new  skills  and knowledge so we can give every Australian the opportunities they need.

We  know  that  quality  early  childhood  education  significantly  increases opportunities later in life.

That means our investment in people must start at birth and continue throughout their life.

National Security.

The Australian people are currently preoccupied with the threat of terrorism.

Labor  has  adopted  a  responsible  approach  to  national  security  and  we  will continue to do so.

I’ve welcomed the decision to return the SAS to Australia and  concentrate more effectively on our region.

I’ve been calling for that since the Bali Bombing.

But  for  all  the  credit  the  Government  has  got  -  and  I’m  prepared  to  give  them credit where  it’s  due  -  they  have  no plan.  They’ve  been  too reactive.  They’ve played partisan political games.  And I don’t think they’ve always put Australia’s interests first.

It was on display again yesterday when the Prime Minister equivocated over the provocative statements about Muslim women and the clothes they wear.  National leaders  have  responsibilities  to  respond  to  these  statements  immediately  and unequivocally;  to  speak  up  for  the  nation  and  the  need  to  tolerance;  not  to promote division, blame or scapegoating.  His equivocation at the time of the rise of Hansonism showed what damage that was caused to the social fabric of the nation by poor leadership of this kind.

10

Labor will continue to put forward constructive initiatives.

If we are to genuinely secure our borders there are a number of other things we must do.

We need a more independent foreign policy that puts Australia’s interests first and make a stronger commitment to ensuring that international law and diplomacy is upheld within the UN system.

This Government uses the UN only when it suits it.

Labor  has  a  fundamental  commitment  to  promoting  Australia’s  role  as  a  good international citizen.

We have always held this view and it is even more important now in this time of international uncertainty.

We need a UN-based solution to the Iraq crisis.

We need a new national security policy to coordinate our security and intelligence effort.

And  we  need  an  Australian  Coast  Guard  -  a  cop  on  the  beat  -  to  defend  our coastline from drugs and guns and people smugglers.

Conclusion.

At this time of national pain, we’re all rightly reassessing what’s important to us.

That’s what Curtin and Chifley did during the Second World War.

This war of course isn’t as intensive as the Second World War, but the principle is the same: we have to win the war and win the peace.

Let’s not forget what we’re defending.

We’re  defending  great  Australian  values  like  tolerance,  fairness  and  opportunity for all.

Those are the values I will defend.

And  over  the  next  year  Labor  will  be  releasing  new  policies  to  give  new  life  to these values.

Thank you.
