RUDD GOVERNMENT CONFESSES TO NATIONAL SECURITY BREACH

Mr Michael Keenan MP

Shadow Minister for Justice and Customs

Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Chris Evans admitted the Government chartered an aircraft to

knowingly bring four asylum seekers deemed to be a threat to national security from Indonesia to Australia.

Shadow Minister for Justice and Customs Michael Keenan said this is an outrageous breach of national security.

“It is the Government’s responsibility to protect our borders - not only have they failed to protect our borders, they

knowingly brought people deemed to be a national security threat from a third country into Australia,” said Mr

Keenan.

“They have betrayed the trust of the Australian people, and threatened the integrity of our border protection

system.”

“The Rudd Government must explain why they would act in such a reckless manner with regard to a national

security matter.”
