DOWNER CONTRIBUTION TO HUMANITARIAN RELIEF EFFORT FOR IRAQ OBSCENE

For a country that is a present only one of three states planning to deploy combat  troops against Iraq within the next month, the Howard Government’s decision to  allocate US $5 million to the massive humanitarian cost that will arise from such a  war is simply obscene.

The UN has calculated that a war in Iraq would result in:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ 100,000 civilians requiring immediate emergency assistance;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Between 4.2 and 7.2 million internally displaced persons; and

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Between 900,000 and 1.4 million refugees.

Furthermore, the United Nations’ Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian  Affairs has released two donor alerts Iraq already - one in early December last year  and the other in mid-February. These donor alerts are to cover the immediate  upfront costs of deploying food, shelter, medical assistance and other emergency  relief in the initial stages of a war alone.

I’m advised that the total request for this initial emergency fund is approximately  AUD $300 million.

So the Howard Government, as one of only three signed up “military” members of  the “Coalition of the Willing,” has decided to contribute less than 3% of the UN’s  initial emergency humanitarian fund for Iraq.

The Howard Government seems to be an enthusiastic contributor to the war - but a  non-enthusiastic contributor to the peace.
