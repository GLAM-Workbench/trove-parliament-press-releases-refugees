Beenleigh Address - Saturday, 21/03/98

Â

Ladies and Gentlemen,

Â

I congratulate you, 
each and every one of you, for taking the time to come and listen to 
what I have to say.

Â

That is what I actually 
say, in full and in context, rather than the edited or selectively reported 
version, or even worse, the intentionally taken out of context version 
which is meant to change the real meaning of what I say, and the real 
meaning of what One Nation and I stand for.

Â

It is most important 
in today's Australia to make a particular point of making ourselves 
heard, and of making our points understood.

Â

We must use what is 
left of our freedom of speech.

Â

The little that as yet 
has not been taken away by the politically correct minorities and those 
in government who serve their whims.

Â

By being here now   you are exercising 
the rights of freedom of speech we have always taken for granted. It 
is only recently we have begun to realise just how under threat those 
rights are.

Â

I recall the saying, 
"the price of freedom is eternal vigilance."

Â

In the case of our freedom 
of speech, we have not been vigilant.

Â

We have allowed minority 
interests to invade and defeat the rights of the majority and, as a 
result, we, the once happy go lucky, she'll be right mate, Australians, 
who would just about say anything, have found ourselves heavily censored 
and in many cases unsure what we are allowed to say.

Â

Be assured, she won't 
be right mate, it is up to us to make the difference, it is not going 
to just happen, it must be made to happen.

Â

Once   we called ourselves the lucky country, but I remember once 
hearing, "yes we are lucky and the harder we work the luckier we 
get".

Â

If you've had enough, 
now is the time, for there is a lot of work to be done if we are to 
once again be that lucky country.

Â

Fellow Australians,

Â

Have no doubt, we are 
in trouble. There is no simpler or more accurate way of saying it.

Â

We are in trouble.

Â

When I say we, I mean 
all of us.

Â

You, me and even the 
people who ignorantly or selfishly oppose what we stand for will eventually 
all fall victim to the anarchy and social chaos to which our so called 
leaders have either shut their eyes, or carefully arranged and managed.

Â

Worse than just us, 
it will be our children and the generations that follow who will bear 
the real brunt of ongoing decision making by people with questionable 
motives,

Â

Liberal and Labor always 
maintain the country is on track, but the question is, whose track is 
it and where is this track really taking us'?

Â

When governments tell you they are proud of their  record, just 
consider these simple facts.

Â

Rising unemployment, 
rising foreign ownership, rising foreign debt  ,  rising crime, rising substance abuse, 
rising family breakdown and rising taxes.

Â

Is this a record to 
be proud of?

Â

But of course to this 
I must add,

Â

A failing education 
system, a failing health system and second generation welfare.

Â

It has been said that 
we live in uncertain times.

Â

Let mc assure you there 
is in fact a great deal of certainty attached to much of what lays ahead 
and usually certainty provides an element of security but in this case 
the certainty of which I speak is all bad news.

Â

We can be certain the 
real affects of the Asian crash have not yet really touched our shores. 
Apart from the job losses that are mostly yet to occur because we so 
closely and almost exclusively aligned ourselves with Asia,

Â

there is a very real 
concern hundreds of thousand of Asian refugees will head south to Australia.

On the 19th of February, 
the 4BC network ran a report that Australia may face a wave of Indonesian 
refugees as a result of the region's economic crisis.

Â

From the same report, 
I quote former Australian diplomat, Kerry Collinson,

Â

"the threat from 
Indonesia is not a military one, it is a refugee one".

Â

Or this report from 
Melbourne's 3AW in an interview with Dr Magnus Clarke from Deakin University 
on the 24th of February,

Â

“what is happening 
in Indonesia is very important, Defence Chief of Staff, General John 
Baker started talking about risks to Australia, the Indonesian economy 
is falling apart, riots, civil disturbances, particularly against Chinese.

Â

It's not a Nation, but an Empire.

Â

A flood of refugees looking for a home".

Â

While it is taboo to say this, the fact is our immigration policies 
have, in combination with our policies of multiculturalism, divided 
us into different kinds of Australians wit h many not considering 
themselves to be Australians at all.

Â

They have simply transplanted 
their way of life to Australia.

They have no loyalty 
to this country. To them, it is just another place to live. To us, and 
to the future of this nation, that is a problem.

Â

Our government's inappropriate 
immigration policies have also assisted the growth in unemployment. 
A fact even the Prime Minister and the Minister for Immigration have 
finally admitted.

Â

Worse still is the question 
of imported crimes such as home invasion or, as disclosed by the National 
Crime Authority, the fact that 96% of heroin trafficking is the work 
of Asian gangs.

Â

Recently there was the 
brutal and unprovoked knifing of a young man by Asian gang members in 
George Street Sydney. This young Australian was stabbed fourteen times 
and it is reported there were some forty Asian gang members involved 
in   this 
vicious attack which occurred because this eighteen year old Australian 
came to the aid of his friend who had accidentally bumped into one of 
the gang members as he walked down the street.

Â

Lets not fool ourselves 
in Queensland that we are isolated from these attacks and that this 
is just a problem for New South Wales, Queensland's turn is coming.

Â

Are we expected to just accept this type of beh aviour as an 
unfortunate and violent consequence of aspects of our immigration policy?

Â

Already in Brisbane 
similar attacks are not uncommon. The most well known one recently being 
the murder of a young American Sailor   who was also the victim of a vicious knife attack.

Â

Is it just bad luck, 
or is it bad policy and bad management?

Â

The multiculturalists 
would say these are isolated incidents not at all typical and an attempt 
at scapegoating,

Â

If you believe that, 
just pick up almost any metropolitan Newspaper on any day and you will 
find what is happening to our country staring out at you page after 
page.

Â

These violent multicultural 
problems are currently more obvious in New South Wales, but remember 
Queensland's turn is coming.

Â

It would be remiss of 
me if I   
were not to mention the importation of infectious diseases through immigration.

Â

The following figures 
just like all the facts mentioned by me here are not my facts,

Â

they are not something 
I dreamed up to suit my stand, they are from the demography papers of 
Monash University, 'People and Places' and the 'Australian Medical Journal'.

Â

Until about 15 - 20 
years ago, hepatitis B which is 100 times more contagious than AIDS 
was virtually non-existent in Australia.

Â

Today there are three 
hundred thousand carriers, thirty thousand new infections every year 
and an annual   death toll of twelve hundred.

Â

Hepatitis B just on 
its own takes one hundred million dollars per year out of our health 
budget.

Â

There is no doubt over 
the ethnic origin of some 90% of the carriers and no doubt as to why 
this disease is now out of control and yet if you speak of this it is 
said you are a racist.

Â

When it was suggested 
the government should not allow entry of people with such infectious 
diseases they responded that it was discriminatory to not allow these 
infected individuals entry to our country.

Â

I put to you that rather 
than discriminate against seriously infected foreigners, our own government 
chose to discriminate against its own citizens and endanger all Australians.

Â

To add insult to injury, 
they further endangered us by not embarking on a drive for immunisation 
to protect us because to do so would have meant disclosing what they   had exposed 
us to and that kind of truth is of course not politically correct.

Â

If you were one of the 
people in South Australia currently on a 2 year waiting list to see 
a dentist to simply get a filling, you might be excused for wondering 
how much better off you would be if so much of our health budget wasn't 
needed to deal with imported problems.

Â

Then of course there 
is tuberculosis. Something we had eliminated from Australia.

Â

However, a study of 2290 inner city Sydney schoolchildren aged between 
12 and 14 discovered a frightening 27% of those born overseas were carrying 
tuberculosis.

Â

They, successive governments, both Liberal and Labor have failed to 
address the needs of Aust ralians and instead spent their energies 
on being citizens of the world.

Â

They are all guilty,

Â

Their policies so similar 
you would swear they take their instructions from the same people.

Â

Perhaps it is the United   Nations that 
dictates policies with the Australian government of the day little more 
than the administrators.

Â

Is the state of our country such that we can feel secure those supposedly 
in charge are working for us?

Â

The decision is yours, are our politicians working for us, or for 
themselves and  international interests?

Â

I mentioned unemployment.

Â

It was disclosed last 
week by the Australian Bureau of Statistics that the real figure for 
unemployment in Australia is 19%,

Â

not 8.5%: 19%.

Â

That's two million Australians 
out of work,

Â

not seven or eight hundred 
thousand: two million.

Â

I have spoken of the 
true level of unemployment on many occasions, now the government's deceit 
on this issue has been exposed by one of their own departments.

Â

The great sell-off of 
Australia continues and because the government will not disclose what 
foreigners are actually buying, how much of Australian business is actually 
still owned by Australians is extremely hard to determine but it is 
estimated we are the most foreign owned developed country in the world.

Â

We all know these companies 
but did you know they are no longer Australian owned,

Â

Arnotts, Franklins, 
Speedo, Aeroplane Jelly, Birdseye, Billy Tea, Orlando Wines, Tooheys, 
Four X, Four and Twenty Pies and Ampol to name but a few and would you 
believe, 'It's moments like these", even minties is now foreign 
owned.

Â

When the government 
tells you of the tremendous benefits of foreign investment, in particular, 
jobs for Australians, just remember the real story.

Â

The vast majority of 
foreign investment buys up existing successful Australian enterprises 
and then more often than not, downsizes die workforce.

Â

Are you aware even the 
labelling on our shopping shelves is extremely deceptive when it comes 
to ownership and product origin?

Â

The label may say, Made 
in Australia or Product of Australia or Australian owned but the fact 
is in many cases the products are imported and simply packaged in Australia.

Â

For example, orange 
juice concentrate from Brazil is mixed with Australian water and packaged 
as product of Australia.

Â

Imported pork is put 
in brine in Australia and packaged as product of Australia and nuts 
imported from India appear in packets emblazoned with the Australian 
flag.

Â

The Coalition promised 
their policies would reduce Australia's foreign debt yet last week the 
figure hit an all time record of two hundred and twenty two billion.

Â

The fact is that since 
the Libcrals came to power our foreign debt has risen $28 billion.

Â

Crime is on the rise 
everywhere. Over the last 10 years in Queensland,

Â

Rape mid attempted rape 
has increased 150%.

Â

Armed robbery has increased 
220%,

Â

Serious assault has increased 240%.

Â

Unarmed robbery has increased 260%.

Â

Extortion, a particularly popular pursuit with certain ethnic criminals, 
has increased 500%.

Â

In NSW, their own Police Comm issioner has spoken out on the 
subject   
of ethnic related crime and then been soundly vilified for simply speaking 
the truth.

Â

In recent times, 2 of 
their off duty policemen have been viciously stabbed to death and another 
seriously injured.

Â

If even the police aren't 
safe on Australian streets, what hope do the rest of us have.

Â

In the case of substance 
abuse our problems grow daily.

Â

Through Western Australia 
alone it is estimated by the National Crime Authority that 1.4 billion 
dollars worth of illegal drugs enter Australia.

Â

We all know of the problems 
of places like Cabramatta and that you can now get a shot of heroin 
for about the same price as a packet of cigarettes. Remember, Queensland's 
turn is coming.

Â

In the case of drug 
importation the federal police and customs are so under resourced they 
can only search 3 in every 100 containers coming into Australia.

Â

As rents, rates, food and other living costs continue to rise, many 
PAYE taxpayers are trapped in poor paying jobs with little relief or 
even a reasonable element of job security.

Â

Meanwhile, multinationals with government help screw our farmers into 
the  ground to reduce costs and maximise profits but without then 
passing any savings on to the Australian consumer.

Â

Late last year the government 
dropped the tariff on imported sugar and effectively took an average 
of $3000 out of the pocket of every sugarcane grower and just gave what 
amounted to millions of dollars to the multinational softdrink and confectionary 
manufacturers.

Â

Australia's main competitor 
in sugar is Thailand, and they have a tariff of 104%.

Â

Thailand protects their 
sugar industry, but our government just looks after the big business 
of the multinationals.

Â

Is that the government's 
idea of a level playing field?

Â

Are any of you paying 
less for your softdrink? Are any of you seeing the price of Mars bars 
slashed?

Â

To make matters worse, 
the taxation department admits multinationals pay little or no tax. 
They take their profits and leave the average Aussie to foot the bill.

Â

The fact is the government's 
attack on the rural sector isn't restricted to sugar.

Â

Talk to anyone in the 
timber industry or citrus or grain or pork, in fact it is hard to find 
a group the government hasn't brought to their knees.

Â

In the case of the chicken 
industry, the government is letting in cooked chicken meat from Thailand.

Â

In fact the Thais are 
doing pretty well out of our government.

Â

They are helping to 
protect their sugar industry, giving their chicken industry a hand and 
all of this on top of us swapping a billion dollars with them to help 
them through their financial problems.

Â

And with chicken, there is a very  real chance a chicken disease, 
called Newcastle disease, will be imported along with the meat.

Â

In Thailand, this disease 
is rampant but we don't have it, yet.

Â

The chicken industry 
currently employs 17,000 Australians directly and another 45,000 indirectly. 
If this disease gets in it will not only do serious damage to our chicken 
industry by killing millions of chickens but it will also kill off a 
lot of our native birdlife.

Â

Ladies and Gentlemen,

Â

There is a saying,

Â

"If they destroy 
the cities, the country will rc-build them but if they destroy the country, 
the cities will starve."

Â

We must not keep pushing 
families off the land. We must never allow ourselves to be reliant on 
imported food.

Â

You've heard of the 
level playing field, of economic rationalism and successive governments' 
pursuit of free trade.

Â

In fact for the last 
20 years or so we've had free trade forced down our throats like a cure 
for all our ills.

Â

However the effect of 
these policies on Australian manufacturing has been absolutely devastating 
and led to hundreds of thousands of job losses.

Â

The textile clothing 
and footwear industry is a case in point. Remember Berlei or Gloweave 
or Coats Paton, they're all gone.

Â

Twenty years ago the 
TCF industry just in Geelong alone employed over fifteen thousand people, 
today, less than three thousand of those jobs remain.

Â

Then of course we have 
the treacherous closures by the supposedly big Australian, BHP.

Â

All these jobs and countless 
thousands more were exported to foreign lands and now feed the families 
of foreign workforces while our own kids wonder if the dole is the only 
future they have.

Â

I cannot get away without 
mentioning the disgraceful and continual attempts to help Indonesia 
while so many of our own people go without.

Â

Here we have a country 
run by one of the cruelest dictators in the world.

Â

A man who has been President 
for over 30 years and personally pocketed what has been estimated to 
be between ten and twenty billion dollars.

Â

A man who ordered the 
invasion of East Timor and presided over the systematic murder of what 
Amnesty International has estimated to be over three hundred thousand 
East Timorese.

Â

Does anyone doubt Indonesia 
has one of the most corrupt and bloodthirsty regimes in the world and 
yet our government are falling all over themselves to give them billions 
of dollars.

Â

Indonesia is a country that can afford to keep six battalions of troops 
on East Timor and recently purchased over six hundred million dollars 
worth of state of the art fighter planes and six submarines while our 
own Australian Army hasn't even got enough  ammunition to practice 
with.

Â

The government can find 
the money to help the likes of Suharto but they can't fix our hospitals 
or our schools or stop our kids from committing suicide.

Â

I say let Suharto put 
his own hand in his own pocket and bail his own country out.

Â

I must speak of the stupidity of the Native title debate.

Â

The bottom line is you either believe in land rights or you don't.

Â

Personally, I don't, because the whole notion of land rights divides 
us as a people.

Â

We must be treated equally.

Â

We  are all entitled to a helping hand but as individuals in 
need, not on the basis of race.

Â

The land belongs to 
all Australians not a few who claim they were unfairly conquered and 
want the return of their land.

Â

The activist Aboriginals 
lose all credibility with land claims such as Bondi Beach or more recently 
the one lodged over Federal Parliament House.

Â

Up to 79% of Australia 
is potentially subject to land claims by less than   2% of the population.

Â

So far two claims have 
been settled at the cost of ninety million dollars.

Â

We cannot afford this 
inequity which just feeds solicitors, barristers and QCs at the taxpayers 
expense.

Â

My Grandparents were 
English and Irish but I do not claim to be English or Irish and yet 
in reality I have more English and Irish blood in me than most who claim 
to be Aboriginal have Aboriginal blood in them.

Â

The Aboriginal cause 
has been seriously damaged by people who are not really Aboriginal, 
many are just parasites living off the Aboriginal industry which has 
cost the taxpayers of Australia over thirty billion dollars during the 
last 16 years.

Â

Despite these incredible 
costs, the real Aboriginal people are no better off'.

Â

The land claims are 
wrong.

Â

We have been made to 
feel guilty by incessant PR campaigns with little basis in truth and 
the fact is we will only be able to all live together as Australians 
when we are all treated equally and assisted on the basis of need not 
race.

Â

No one group in society 
has a monopoly on being poor or hungry or unemployed.

Â

Yet there arc many financial 
advantages to claiming Aboriginality and this has caused great resentment 
in the community, especially among non-Aboriginals who arc very disadvantaged.

Â

I say again we must 
all be treated equally and the same, in particular in the eyes of the 
law.

Â

Society's helping hand 
must be extended to all in genuine need, but because of genuine need, 
not a presumed need on the basis of race.

Â

It is the government 
that   has racist policies, not me, and they are clearly in print 
for all to see.

Â

I call for equality 
for all Australians.

Â

one of the most important 
issues to emerge recently has been the Multilateral Agreement on Investment.

Â

An international treaty 
currently being negotiated by our government.

Â

The MAI as it is known, if signed in its current form , will 
give away what little economic protection we have left and open our 
doors to unchecked raping and pillaging by multinationals.

Â

This treaty is the ultimate 
in free trade.

Â

It is economic rationalism 
taken to the enth degree and a pox on ordinary Australians.

Â

Please keep your eye 
on the MAI.

Â

It must be stopped.

Â

When I started I said 
we were in trouble.

Â

I say again, all of 
us, we Australians, are in trouble but it can all be changed by the 
will of the people.

Â

It will not be an easy 
fight.

Â

It will not be a quick 
fight.

Â

But it is a fight we 
must win because it should   be clear we are where we are now because 
of the devastating policies of Liberal and Labor and unless we change 
direction, their foolishness and International agenda will leave us 
in a country we don't own.

Â

We will be surrounded 
by people we don't know and cannot communicate with and if our kids 
are lucky they might have jobs in a foreign owned sweatshop or turning 
down beds in a foreign owned hotel.

Â

Australia as we know 
it, and all the good   things about it, will disappear as we 
import and inherit more and more of the problems of the other countries 
of the world.

Â

When Australia is gone and some Asianiscd continent stands in its 
place, how will we face the memory of those who sacrificed their lives 
to preserve the future of our nation and its people?

Â

Fellow Australians,

Â

We must take a stand.

Â

We must draw a line  in the sand and shout out loud, "enough 
is enough".

Â

We must take a more 
nationalistic approach and start to look after our own first and foremost.

Â

Immigration has brought 
some wonderful people to Australia.

Â

People who came here 
for a better way of life and worked hard to make sure they had that 
better way of life for themselves and their children.

Â

But mass immigration 
has now gone off the rails and must be stopped. We must initiate a policy 
of zero nett gain.

Â

That is to only replace 
the thirty thousand or so who leave our shores each year and to stabilise 
our population until we can get unemployment under control.

Â

I mean really under 
control, not just hide the true figures as governments have done for 
years.

Â

One Nation would implement such a policy.

Â

We can be and must be 
more selective as to who we allow to immigrate to Australia.

Â

We must discriminate 
in the interests of the people who are here. They must be our priority, 
not the unlucky from somewhere else.

Â

We should screen migrants 
carefully for their ability to assimilate, for the skills they bring, 
the money they bring, the employment they, with their investment, may 
create.

Â

In particular we must 
protect ourselves from further importation of disease.

Â

We have a lot to offer 
in Australia and above all we must make certain our country doesn't 
just become like all the other places people are desperately trying 
to leave.

Â

One Nation would put 
an end to the funding of multiculturalism.

Â

This policy is divisive 
and costs billions of dollars that could otherwise be spent on issues 
such as crime, health and education.

Â

We welcome people, whoever 
they are, and wherever they come from, but we expect them to be good 
law abiding and loyal citizens who appreciate the value of their new 
opportunity in Australia and show their appreciation by giving this 
country their undivided loyalty.

Â

If they don't want to 
be Australian and simply want to live their old way of life with   all its old 
problems in this land, then they shouldn't come.

Â

People who want to live 
here and use this country without wanting to truly be Australian and 
take the same passionate responsibilities the rest of us take are no 
good to us,

Â

We do not ask anyone 
to forget where they are from, only that they remember where they are 
now.

Â

We must abandon multiculturalism.

Â

Australians are people 
from everywhere but in the end it is Australians we must be and that 
is in everyone's interest.

Â

I say again, we must 
not allow this country to continue on the path to being like all the 
countries people want to leave.

Â

We must crack down on 
crime of all types and give our police the power and respect they need 
to deal with the problems on the streets.

Â

The streets must once 
again belong to the innocent not the guilty.

Â

We must make sure criminals 
are treated like criminals and that victims rights are acknowledged 
and upheld.

Â

We must pay particular 
attention to drugs and gangs and not tolerate their existence.

Â

We cannot be too tough 
when it comes to eradicating drugs or the horror of gangs from Australian 
society.

Â

It is One Nation policy 
to negotiate treaties with other countries so when a non-Australian 
citizen commits an offence that carries a prison sentence,

Â

we will catch them, 
try them and sentence them but then we send them back to do their time 
in a gaol in their own country.

Â

As it costs between 
forty and sixty thousand dollars a year to keep a prisoner in the relative 
luxury of our gaols, even if we have to pay for their imprisonment, 
most of the time we will still come out ahead.

Â

One Nation will make  other countries criminals another of Australia's 
export successes.

Â

Our unemployment problem 
will not be solved by pushing everyone into further education.

Â

All further education 
has done in the competitive job market is take the jobs of the less 
educated and give them to the more educated.

Â

We have university graduates taking jobs that used to be the property 
of high school graduates.

Â

Unemployment cannot be fixed with education, training or the dole; 
it can only   be fixed through real long-term job creation.

Â

On the 13th of August 
last year I announced One Nation's policy of re-industrialisation.

Â

Despite being released 
to the whole of the national press, this announcement did not rate a 
single mention anywhere in Australia.

Â

One Nation will re-industrialise 
Australia not just because of the need for us to once again build self-reliance 
as a nation but because it is the only way to create a diversity of 
skilled, semi-skilled and unskilled jobs that will be real and permanent.

Â

We will revitalise apprenticeships 
and make these opportunities available once again to fifteen and sixteen 
year olds so we will give them a chance and our country its own home 
grown supply of tradespersons.

Â

One nation will restore 
tariff protection and stop the export of Australian jobs.

Â

One Nation will also 
return respect and appropriate funding to our defence forces and give 
those brave young   Australian men and woman the tools and colleagues they need 
to ensure our nation's defence.

Â

One Nation will create 
a truly peoples' bank to assist with the finances required for the re-building 
of our nation, particularly the rural sector.

Â

We will help keep the 
man on the land by providing the incentives to carry on the farming 
traditions that filled the early years of our nation's development.

Â

One Nation will overhaul 
our tax system, reduce the burden on PAYE taxpayers, force multinationals 
to pay their share of tax and we will not introduce a GST.

Â

One Nation will bring 
an end to most of the billions of dollars wasted on the gifts our government 
calls foreign aid and re-prioritise this money to the benefit of our 
own people.

Â

One Nation will abolish 
native title and remove all government policies that advantage people 
by virtue of their race.

Â

One Nation will abolish 
ATSIC, and see that Aboriginal Australians get the help they need without 
the Aboriginal Mafia who act as middlemen and just rip off those who 
are truly in need.

Â

Under One Nation policy, 
all Australians will be treated equally.

Â

Under One Nation policy 
we will trade with the world and be successful because of the quality 
and value of our products not through trade agreements that sell us 
short.

Â

Fellow Australians,

Â

For too long we have 
undervalued ourselves and our country.

Â

We have given away much 
for a fraction of its true value and failed to support our own business 
and our own people.

Â

Even our own inventors have been forced overseas through lack of government 
vision.

Â

One People,

Â

One Flag,

Â

One Set of Rules,

Â

One Nation.

Â

Fellow Australians,

Â

At the next election you will finally truly have a choice.

Â

For your  own sake and the sake of your children and the generations 
that follow,

Â

use that choice,

Â

make a change.

Â

The decision is yours.

Â

Thank you for listening.

Â

Â
