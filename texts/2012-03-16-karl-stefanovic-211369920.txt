E&OE……………………….…………………………………………………………………

KARL STEFANOVIC:

Tony, good morning to you. Have you got a problem with David Gonski?

TONY ABBOTT:

No, I don’t. My argument is not with David Gonski, my argument is with the Government, Karl. The  Government has been incompetent in managing the selection process and it has been untruthful about what’s  been happening.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

Can this be managed from here on? Because Peter Costello, clearly, is not a happy camper. Have they done  the wrong thing?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, Peter Costello created the Future Fund. Kevin Rudd put him on the fund but, let’s face it, the fund is  only there because of the surpluses that Peter Costello consistently piled up - every cent, every dollar in that  Future Fund was put there by Peter Costello. Of course he would have been a good candidate. He was the  recommendation of Gonski. The Government has appointed to chair the Future Fund someone who said he  wasn’t the best candidate for the job.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

So, if you come into power do you get rid of Gonski and put Peter Costello in charge?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I’m not, as I said, against David Gonski who is a highly reputable, highly capable businessman.  Gonski is well qualified to chair the board. The problem is not Gonski. The problem is an incompetent and  dishonest Government and we have seen more evidence of their incompetence and dishonesty in the way  they have handled this.

KARL STEFANOVIC:



You can’t have your cake and eat it too, though. I mean, Gonski is either qualified or he isn’t. You have just  said he is qualified.

TONY ABBOTT:

Yes, but he wasn’t the recommended candidate. The recommended candidate was Peter Costello and the  Government rejected Peter Costello - not because they are interested in economic management, but because  they’re obsessed with political management.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

Alright, let’s move on. Indonesia’s Foreign Minister has blasted your plan to turn asylum seeker boats back  to Indonesia. He says that pushing the problem from one country to another won’t work and the countries  need to work together. It is a fairly big blow, isn’t it?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I think you’re rather overstating the Indonesian Foreign Minister’s words. But, Karl, we have turned  the boats around before, we can turn them around again. Let’s not forget these are Indonesian flagged,  Indonesian crewed, Indonesian home-ported vessels that are coming from Indonesia. Of course they can go  back to Indonesia. They have done it before, they can do it again.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

So, if you win government you will still pursue your plan to turn boats around mid-ocean and send them  back to Indonesia?

TONY ABBOTT:

Absolutely we will, Karl.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

Alright. Labor has played down Clive Palmer’s threatened challenge to the carbon tax in the High Court. Do  you believe there are constitutional problems with the carbon tax?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, my problem with the carbon tax is that it is unethical to say one thing before an election and do the  opposite afterwards. Let’s see what the lawyers think about its constitutionality. I think it is a fundamental  breach of political ethics, a fundamental breach of honesty for the Prime Minister to say “there will be no  carbon tax under the government I lead” to win votes and then put a carbon tax in to keep the Greens happy  and stay in office. Now, it is the ethical problems as much as the constitutional problems that I think are the  real difficulty with the carbon tax.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

Julia Gillard had this to say about your relationship with Clive Palmer yesterday:

JULIA GILLARD:

We’ve learned over the last 24 hours that Clive Palmer tells Tony Abbott what to do, that’s because Tony  Abbott is in politics to look after the billionaires.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

Tony, are you Clive Palmer’s toy boy?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, Karl, this is just more cheap smear from the dirty tricks department of the Government. I mean, I  think it is really pathetic behaviour from a desperate Prime Minister and, you know, her words attack  billionaires but her policies attack families. That’s what I am doing - I am standing up for the families of  Australia.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

Tony, you haven’t answered the question. Are you Clive Palmer’s toy boy?

TONY ABBOTT:

He couldn’t afford me, Karl! I’m standing up for the families of Australia - against the carbon tax, against  the private health insurance means test, against the schools hit-list and all the other things that this  government is doing to the families of Australia.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

I suppose everyone’s got a price at some point. Let’s talk about your youngest daughter Bridget who, thank  God, looks like her beautiful mother. She’s the new face of BMW’s Sydney racing carnival. Now, she is  fantastic, she needs to go into politics, this woman. She’s got an honest face. Also she is saying that her dad  needs to wax his chest for charity. Are you willing to do that, Tony Abbott? Make a commitment.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, Karl, I carefully listened to Ben’s interview with Bridget yesterday and Ben put it to Bridgie that I  should do that and Bridgie manfully stood up for me and, you know, I warned Bridgie against boys like Ben  and this is just more argument for Bridgie not to talk to Ben.

KARL STEFANOVIC:

Solid advice from dad. Thank you, Tony. Have a great weekend, mate. Talk to you soon.

TONY ABBOTT:

And you, too. See you.
