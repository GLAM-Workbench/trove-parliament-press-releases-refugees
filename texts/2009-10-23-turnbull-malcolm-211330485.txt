Fri, 23rd October 2009   TURNBULL INTERVIEW WITH MARIUS BENSON (ABC NEWSRADIO) -  AUSTRALIA’S POPULATION, BORDER PROTECTION, ASYLUM SEEKERS, JOHN  HOWARD

The Hon Malcolm Turnbull MP   Leader of the Opposition

E&OE

MARIUS BENSON:

Malcolm Turnbull, good morning.

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Good morning. Good to be with you.

MARIUS BENSON:

35 million people by 2050. Do you share Kevin Rudd’s enthusiasm for an Australia that big?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Australia is going to continue growing and I do welcome a larger population but so long as  we have the infrastructure to enable us all to live here in a sustainable way. And the great  thing that is missing from Mr Rudd’s enthusiasm is any coherent long term plans for water.  He has completely fumbled and bumbled with the enormous opportunity we left him for the  management of interstate water with the Howard Government’s National Plan for Water  Security. He has failed to take up that challenge and, of course, as far as infrastructure is  concerned, we are seeing tens of billions of dollars being spent ineffectively. Where is the  long term planning for mass transit, for urban transport infrastructure that is absolutely vital?  If Sydney is going to be a city with twice the population it will be impossible to live in unless  there is a coherent long term plan. Now, historically that has always been the role of state  governments, but Mr Rudd, despite all of his rhetoric of working closely with state  governments and despite the fact that he said there was going to be a great windfall because  they were all in the Labor Party, we have seen around Australia very little evidence for any  effective cooperation or any effective planning.

MARIUS BENSON:

But get it right and you think a number like 35 million is realistic? To have seven million in  Sydney, seven million in Melbourne, four million in Brisbane. There is an argument that this  looks like a big country but really it’s just a small country spread over a large area - it is too  many.

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Well it is all critically a question of planning. The biggest resource challenge we have in  terms of population in Australia is water scarcity. We are a very dry continent and likely to  get drier and we are, certainly if you look at southern Australia and you look at the southern  part of the Murray-Darling Basin, the inflows at the moment are dramatically lower than long  term averages. So water planning is absolutely vital. Now if you just take that example of

water, when we were in Government we had a vision, not simply for the Federal Government  taking over interstate water and we legislated for that, but we also set aside ten billion dollars  to replumb rural Australia so that we would have irrigation farming being conducted not with  water being transported through leaky open channels but through pipes so that we could  produce more food and fibre with less water.

What has Mr Rudd done in the two years he has been in government? Precious little. There  has been virtually nothing invested in replumbing rural Australia. Money has been spent on  buying back water rights which, for the most part, has been very ineffective as the  Productivity Commission has noted and, of course, the consequence is that it actually reduces  our agricultural capacity. So he was left a great set of tools and a large amount of money to  get on with that visionary job of replumbing rural Australia and using our water wisely, and  he has failed to do it.

MARIUS BENSON:

Okay. Can I ask you about asylum seekers, which has obviously been the big topic through  the week in Parliament? Tough but humane is Kevin Rudd’s mantra on that. Does that  essentially sum up how you would read the Australian electorate’s hopes and expectations for  dealing with this issue?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Well I think what the Australian electorate expect governments to do and what every  government should seek to do is pursue two goals. First is to ensure that our borders are  secure, that as far as practicable there is no people smuggling and no unauthorised maritime  arrivals of asylum seekers. We have a very generous humanitarian program. We take a lot of  refugees in from around the world and obviously we do not want to outsource our refugee  program to the people smugglers. If I could just go on Marius, the second goal of equal  importance is to respond to the needs of refugees in a generous and humane way in  accordance with our obligations under the United Nations convention on refugees. So we’ve  got to pursue both policies but we’ve got to do so in a way that is effective.

Now at the moment the simple fact of the matter is that the Prime Minister is in denial. He is  refusing to recognise that the changes he made as he unpicked the policy framework of the  previous government have sent a signal to people smugglers that Australia is a soft target.  They have assiduously marketed that to their potential customers. This was predicted by the  Federal Police, it was predicted by the Indonesians, it was predicted by the International  Organisation for Migration, and as a consequence we are seeing now resurgence in people  smuggling and 43 boats over the period since August last year and 2,000 people.

MARIUS BENSON:

And you say that’s the result of unstitching the policies of the previous Howard Government  but you don’t want to restitch those. You’re not quite sure what you want to do on this.

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Well Marius, look, that isn’t correct. The focus has to be on the Government. I mean we have  a big debate going on here. Now Mr Rudd is trying to turn it into a hysterical debate. As I  said in the Parliament this week, we must speak about this issue in a calm and measured way.

I will not tolerate any criticism of asylum seekers. I recognise these are people often living in  desperate situations who perfectly understandably want to come to Australia. But so do  another 11 million refugees around the world. So let’s not forget that. There are millions of  refugees around the world who would want to come to Australia. So the push factors are  always very strong.

What Mr Rudd is saying is that none of the changes he has made to domestic policy have had  any impact on this increase in refugees. He says it’s all a coincidence. So we have said,  alright, let’s have a calm and measured debate about the policy and the design of it. Let’s  have an independent inquiry which can get the benefit of the advice from the AFP, the advice  from the UNHCR and any other relevant agency, security and otherwise, so that the  Australian people can be informed. And if Mr Rudd doesn’t approve of the policies of the  previous government then we should look at what other policies can be put in place because  the one thing that is clear is that if the objective of his policy is to stop unauthorised arrivals  of asylum seekers courtesy of the people smuggling trade, then his policy has failed and he  has to recognise that.

MARIUS BENSON:

You talked about keeping Australia’s borders secure. Do you believe they’re insecure at the  moment? Do you believe the way of interdicting and then dealing with people who come to  Australian waters is inadequate?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Well, Marius, again you’ve got to judge policies by their outcomes. If the object of the policy  is to stop people smuggling - and Mr Rudd routinely talks about people smugglers as the  vilest of the vile and the lowest of the low and all of these things - if you want to stop people  smuggling, if you want to have no unauthorised arrivals of asylum seekers, if that’s your  objective and you get in the last little over a year, the last 14 months you’ve had 43 boats and  over 2,000 arrivals, then plainly your policy is not working.

So the question for Mr Rudd to answer is - what is the objective of his policy? If his policy  objective is to stop the people smuggling trade then his policy has failed. Now he says the  changes he made have had no impact on that at all; it is a complete coincidence. We beg to  differ, so do most other people, but let’s have an informed policy debate, let’s have that  independent inquiry and examine exactly what the causes of this change are.

MARIUS BENSON:

Just a very quick, final question on an entirely different topic because it was suggested  recently that John Howard might be asked to head the rugby league administration in  Australia and now it’s been reported this morning that that’s been scuttled by Anthony  Albanese, the Labor minister stepping in. Your thoughts on that.

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Well John Howard is a very capable man. That’s an understatement, isn’t it? I mean running  Australian for eleven and a half years and leaving the country in such a sound financial  position as he did, he is one of the great achievers in terms of management, if you like, in our

time. So he would be well qualified to take on any challenge, any job, including one with the  rugby league.

If it is true - and I don’t know whether it is - that the Labor Party have sought to scuttle that  out of sheer vindictiveness then that would, I think, say a lot about the Labor Party. But  really, let’s let Mr Albanese defend it. It may be that the criticisms of him are unfounded.

MARIUS BENSON:

Malcolm Turnbull, thank you very much.
