Mental health crisis on Christmas Island demands urgent action

The Abbott government must send a team of mental health experts to Christmas Island to  assess the crisis situation in the detention centre that is pushing staff and refugees to attempt  suicide, the Australian Greens have said.

"The horrific conditions on Christmas Island are clearly taking their toll on refugees and the  centre staff,” Senator Hanson-Young said.

"The fact that Australian workers are being driven to this extreme action is distressing.

"These attempts by people to take their own lives on Christmas Island are not moral blackmail,  as the Prime Minister has previously said. They are the result of the government’s cruel and  inhumane refugee policies.

"If staff are being pushed to this point, it’s hard to imagine the trauma that refugee children are  suffering locked up inside.

"When a refugee is on 24-hour suicide watch, like so many on Christmas Island are, the security  staff have to be within arm’s length of the person at all times. That puts extreme pressure on  the staff and the refugees.

"The Abbott government must send a team of mental health experts to assess the crisis on  Christmas Island. It's clear the situation on the Island is toxic and cannot be allowed to continue  unchanged."
