SOCIAL SECURITY BULLETIN JANUARY 1983 Senator Don Grimes  Shadow Minister for Social Security  and Veterans' Affairs  Parliament House, Canberra. A.C.T. 2600 Phone: (062) 72 6157  (003) 31 5714 * ÃÂ PENSIONS SLIP BACK ' A . B . S . figures issued on 6 January 1983 show that in the year ending  August 1982 - . Average weekly earnings (male) rose by 15.9% . Average weekly earnings (female) rose by 12.5% But between August 1981 and August 1982 - . Standard pensions rose by only 10.9% This is just one indication of the backwards drift in pension r a t e s . The latest available figure (September 1982) shows the pension as  22.2% of average weekly e a r n i n g s , an appreciable drop from the 24.5%  of a.w.e. which it represented in September 1978. The poverty line for November 1982 was estimated at $84.10 a week, so  that the pension is $6.85 a week below the austere poverty level. While the pension drops, prices rise. One of the most notorious of the  added charges is the average 6% rise in petrol prices authorised by  the Fraser Government from 1 J a n u a r y . This and other price rises occurring now will not show up in the  consumer price index before March 1983. Pensioners will be paying  extra but will not receive indexed increases until the November 1983  adjustment. An estimate of what the Government is saving is to be found in the  answer to the following Question received this month: "Senate Question N o . 2745 - asked on 18 August 1982: Senator G r i m e s : What is the estimated additional cost in 1982-83 of paying pension and benefit increases based on  the March Consumer Price Index (CPI) for the May increase  and the September CPI for the November increase. Senator C h a n e y : The pension and benefit increases in November 1982 were based on the movement in the Consumer Price Index between the December Quarter 1981 and the June Quarter 1982 and the May 1983 increases will be based on the CPI movement between the June and December Quarters of 1982. If these increases were to be based on the CPI movement from the December Quarter 1981 to the September Quarter 1982 and from the September Quarter 1982 to the March Quarter 1982 respectively, the estimated additional cost for automatically indexed pensions and benefits in 1982-83 would be of the order of $170 m i l l i o n ." Labor Party policy has been consistent in its intention to raise  pensions to 25% of average weekly earnings. Paying indexation increases on the previous quarter's CPI could be  a step on the road to reaching the promised 25%. . .  2 .  . -2- ÃÂ *  Â· MEDICAL RECOMMENDATIONS CAN BE PASSED BACK A  recent change on suggested treatment by doctors examining invalid  pension claimants is worth r e p o r t i n g . I had learned that sue .  specialists sometimes reported that a patient  could be helped by certain treatment, but that this information was  never passed back to the patient's treating doctor, so that valuable  suggestions remained locked up in files instead of being forwarded on  to assist the p a t e i e n t . I raised the matter with Senator Chaney who took it up with the  Department of Health. It has now been agreed that the Senior Medical Officers in all  Divisional Offices should pass on to a claimant's treating doctors  details of any recommendations made in reports given to specialists  or other examining medical officers which indicate that the claimant's  condition might be improved if his treatment were changed or modified. This procedure is now to be put into effect in respect of claimants for  invalid pension, sickness benefits and the handicapped c h i l d ’s a l l o w a n c e . FAMILIES OUTSIDE FAMILY INCOME SUPPLEMENT LIMITS The following table relates the incomes of working families with  dependent children to the poverty line and identifies those  eligible for the Family Income Supplement when it comes into effect  on 1 May 1983. It should be noted that the minimum average weekly award wage (male)  was $231.99 a week in September 1982. This will have risen before  the wage freeze to more than $240 a week, so it will be seen that it  is mainly low award and under-award workers who can claim the F.I.S. Of serious concern are the working families just outside the Family  Income Supplement levels. They will not only miss out on $10 a week  for each child. Because they miss out on the health care card, they  will have to pay at least $12.50 a week in private health insurance,   and prescriptions will cost them $4 instead of $2 e a c h . Furthermore, because the Government has ordered a wage freeze -  effectively a wage cut - these same families will pay higher charges  and prices this year on last year's i n c o m e . The Fraser Government consistently refuses to recognise the problems  of struggling families. To the conservatives, families are either  poor - in which case they are designated as worthy to receive health  cards and extra child payments - or well able to pay for health care,  child care and higher prices. But let them try to pay rent/mortgage,   food, clothing, transport, health insurance and other needs for six  people on a weekly income of $265 a week! Australian families trying  to raise children without the smell of poverty deserve a better deal. .  .  3 .  .

PENSIONS SLIP BACK '

A . B . S . figures issued on 6 January 1983 show that in the year ending

August 1982 -

. Average weekly earnings (male) rose by 15.9%

. Average weekly earnings (female) rose by 12.5%

But between August 1981 and August 1982 -

. Standard pensions rose by only 10.9%

This is just one indication of the backwards drift in pension r a t e s .

The latest available figure (September 1982) shows the pension as  22.2% of average weekly e a r n i n g s , an appreciable drop from the 24.5%  of a.w.e. which it represented in September 1978.

The poverty line for November 1982 was estimated at $84.10 a week, so

that the pension is $6.85 a week below the austere poverty level.

While the pension drops, prices rise. One of the most notorious of the

added charges is the average 6% rise in petrol prices authorised by  the Fraser Government from 1 J a n u a r y .

This and other price rises occurring now will not show up in the

consumer price index before March 1983. Pensioners will be paying  extra but will not receive indexed increases until the November 1983  adjustment.

An estimate of what the Government is saving is to be found in the

answer to the following Question received this month:

"Senate Question N o . 2745 - asked on 18 August 1982:

Senator G r i m e s : What is the estimated additional cost in 1982-83 of paying pension and benefit increases based on  the March Consumer Price Index (CPI) for the May increase  and the September CPI for the November increase.

Senator C h a n e y : The pension and benefit increases in November 1982 were based on the movement in the Consumer Price Index between the December Quarter 1981 and the June Quarter 1982 and the May 1983 increases will be based

on the CPI movement between the June and December Quarters of 1982. If these increases were to be based on the CPI

movement from the December Quarter 1981 to the September Quarter 1982 and from the September Quarter 1982 to the March Quarter 1982 respectively, the estimated additional cost for automatically indexed pensions and benefits in 1982-83 would

be of the order of $170 m i l l i o n ."

Labor Party policy has been consistent in its intention to raise  pensions to 25% of average weekly earnings.

Paying indexation increases on the previous quarter's CPI could be  a step on the road to reaching the promised 25%.

MEDICAL RECOMMENDATIONS CAN BE PASSED BACK

A  recent change on suggested treatment by doctors examining invalid  pension claimants is worth r e p o r t i n g .

I had learned that sue .  specialists sometimes reported that a patient  could be helped by certain treatment, but that this information was  never passed back to the patient's treating doctor, so that valuable  suggestions remained locked up in files instead of being forwarded on  to assist the p a t e i e n t .

I raised the matter with Senator Chaney who took it up with the

Department of Health.

It has now been agreed that the Senior Medical Officers in all

Divisional Offices should pass on to a claimant's treating doctors  details of any recommendations made in reports given to specialists  or other examining medical officers which indicate that the claimant's  condition might be improved if his treatment were changed or modified.

This procedure is now to be put into effect in respect of claimants for

invalid pension, sickness benefits and the handicapped c h i l d ’s a l l o w a n c e .

FAMILIES OUTSIDE FAMILY INCOME SUPPLEMENT LIMITS

The following table relates the incomes of working families with  dependent children to the poverty line and identifies those  eligible for the Family Income Supplement when it comes into effect  on 1 May 1983.

It should be noted that the minimum average weekly award wage (male)  was $231.99 a week in September 1982. This will have risen before

the wage freeze to more than $240 a week, so it will be seen that it

is mainly low award and under-award workers who can claim the F.I.S.

Of serious concern are the working families just outside the Family  Income Supplement levels. They will not only miss out on $10 a week

for each child. Because they miss out on the health care card, they

will have to pay at least $12.50 a week in private health insurance,

and prescriptions will cost them $4 instead of $2 e a c h .

Furthermore, because the Government has ordered a wage freeze -  effectively a wage cut - these same families will pay higher charges  and prices this year on last year's i n c o m e .

The Fraser Government consistently refuses to recognise the problems  of struggling families. To the conservatives, families are either  poor - in which case they are designated as worthy to receive health

cards and extra child payments - or well able to pay for health care,

child care and higher prices. But let them try to pay rent/mortgage,

food, clothing, transport, health insurance and other needs for six  people on a weekly income of $265 a week! Australian families trying

to raise children without the smell of poverty deserve a better deal.
