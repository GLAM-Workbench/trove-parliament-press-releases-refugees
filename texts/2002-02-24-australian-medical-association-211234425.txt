TIME FOR 
GOVERNMENT TO SET OUT ITS THIRD TERM HEALTH AGENDA - AMA FEDERAL COUNCIL  Â   
Â  
  Following the AMA Federal 
Council's first meeting of the year, which concluded at the weekend, 
the AMA's Federal President, Dr Kerryn Phelps, said today it is time 
the Government set out its third term health policy agenda.  Â   
Â  
  The AMA Federal Council 
is the peak policy forum representing the interests of more than 27,000 
doctors - GPs, specialists, salaried doctors and doctors-in-training 
- and their patients.  Â   
Â  
  "If the new Health 
Minister's negative response last week to the AMA's GP workforce survey 
is any indication, community health needs are not on the Government's 
priority list," Dr Phelps said.  Â   
Â  
  "Patients in rural 
Australia are missing out on access to quality GP services as a result 
of shortages in suburban and rural areas.   Â   
Â  
  "Many patients and 
whole communities will in the future miss out on the general practice 
care that they need and which others in Australia take for granted.  Â   
Â  
  "In fact, as our 
survey shows, towns, suburbs and regions are suffering from that GP 
shortage now.  Â   
Â  
  "The national shortage 
of doctors is just one problem facing our health system.  Â   
Â  
  "The AMA has set 
a clear agenda for the future of health policy in Australia.  Â   
Â  
  "It supports the 
needs of patients and doctors, and it should have the support of Government," 
Dr Phelps said.  Â   
Â  
  High priority issues agreed 
by the AMA Federal Council include:  Â

Ã¢ÂÂ¢Â   Fragmentation 
of patient care

Â

A    consequence of the break-up of GP funding and 
a massive increase in red tape.

Â

The AMA calls on the Government to examine 
every dollar the Health Department is spending on general practice and 
ensure it is going onto the rebates for those patients most in need, 
instead of the Government putting money into ad hoc schemes for the 
short term.  Â   
Ã¢ÂÂ¢Â   GP training  Â  
  The fall in applications 
for GP training positions, particularly for rural training positions, 
is a consequence of uncertainty and inflexibility in the system. Young 
doctors are concerned that if they accept rural training places, they 
will never be able to practise elsewhere. The new GP training system 
appears fragmented, rigid and the very opposite of 'doctor friendly'.  Â   
Ã¢ÂÂ¢Â   Pharmaceutical Benefits 
Scheme

Â

The AMA recognises the costs of the scheme 
are growing and potentially could blow out. The answer is a more careful 
approach to the screening and determination of the drugs that should 
be listed, provision of timely information for doctors on prescribing 
of new medications, and ensuring that the eligibility of patients for 
the lowest cost drugs is based on real need.

Â

Ã¢ÂÂ¢Â   Complementary 
Medicine

Â

The Government must adopt a scientific approach 
to complementary medicine. The AMA recognises that more and more Australians, 
including a growing number of doctors, are taking an active interest 
in complementary medicine. The Government must offer doctors and patients 
a scientific, analytical approach to complementary medicines and the 
claims of complementary medical practitioners.

Â

Ã¢ÂÂ¢Â   Health 
expenditure

Â

The AMA calls for an audit of health expenditure 
under former Health Minister, Dr Michael Wooldridge. This follows revelations 
in Senate Estimates hearings that money had been transferred from specialist 
outreach programs and an asthma program in order to provide funding 
for the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP) to 
move its headquarters from Melbourne to Canberra.

Â

Â

Dr Phelps said funding commitments must be 
based on public need and getting the best value for the money with an 
increasingly tight health budget.   Â   
Â  
  "There needs to be 
a careful audit to assess the justification for the RACGP funding, whether 
it was in the public interest, and whether it is still justified," 
Dr Phelps said.

Â

Ã¢ÂÂ¢Â   The removal 
of asylum seekers from Manus Island

Â

The AMA backs the call from the College of 
Physicians to move asylum seekers from Manus Island, PNG. Keeping asylum 
seekers in a known malaria prone area is against all the principles 
of good public health.

Â

Â

Dr Phelps said the AMA will seeking further 
meetings with the Minister for Health and Ageing to discuss these high 
priority issues.  Â
