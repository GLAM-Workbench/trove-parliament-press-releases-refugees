E&OE

Subjects: carbon tax, foreign land ownership, Greens in the Senate, WorkChoices, Peter  Reith.



MADONNA KING: To the hallowed halls of Canberra now with the Gillard  Government Minister Dr Craig Emerson. Good  morning; good to see you again.

CRAIG EMERSON: Yes, and good morning to you, Madonna, and to

George.

KING: And to Deputy Opposition Leader in the Senate,

George Brandis. Good morning.

GEORGE BRANDIS: Good morning Madonna. Good morning Craig.

KING: Good to be in sunny Queensland?

BRANDIS: Yes, it is - not all that sunny today.

EMERSON: Who authorised this rain? What's going on? We

escape the frost and …

KING: Well compared to Canberra…

EMERSON: That's right. I'll take the rain any time.

KING: And I was talking to Lindy Burns who's the Drive

presenter on 774 yesterday, and a fog had descended  on Melbourne where you looked out and you couldn't  see the next building.

EMERSON: Yes, well that sounds like Melbourne.

KING: So what's a bit of rain?

EMERSON: But it will be all clear within an hour; then it will be hot

and dry, and then it will rain, and then they'll have a  frost late this afternoon.

KING: Yeah, I was going to say, that's all before lunchtime.

Look. I want to go to several issues and I want to talk  about foreign ownership because my listeners have  asked several questions on that. But first, this morning  we've been talking about the carbon tax. And I want to  address just some of those questions.

Can I start with a question Greg had that I couldn't

answer. Who is going to actually administer the carbon  tax, Craig Emerson?

EMERSON: The Commonwealth will administer it, and it applies to

the 1,000 top emitters, and then the revenue from that  will be used as a combination for both compensating



Page:  3





households, and supporting businesses that are trade  exposed.

KING: But is it a particular department of the Government that

will administer it?

EMERSON: Look, I won't make a guess. Yeah, I think it would be

Treasury. But I don't want to be held to that.

KING: It … will it include extra public servants?

EMERSON: I can't say that there would be zero extra public

servants. Again, I haven't seen any numbers on that  but it wouldn't surprise me if there were more. But I just  haven't seen their numbers.

KING: They were Greg's questions. Scotty phoned in a little

while ago and said why did the Government go for the  big stick approach; that is, punishing the top  companies rather than a carrot approach of saying  Ã¢ÂÂlet's reduce their tax if they drastically reduce their  carbon emissionsÃ¢ÂÂ.

EMERSON: Well that's exactly what happens: that they pay for a

permit. And if they actually reduce their emissions then  they need fewer permits. So it actually is a carrot  approach. So you apply an impost, if you like, and then  if they in a sense do the right thing - that is what is  being sought of them -  then they pay less.

KING: All right. Noel says what will happen if Greenpeace or

Get-up buy all the permits?

EMERSON: Well they will be very wealthy outfits if they've got that

much money to buy all the permits.



Page:  4





KING: How much is a permit?

EMERSON: Well that's still to be determined. It's going to be a

fixed-price permit for the first three years or so, and  then after that it's a market-based permit, so it's set in  an open market.

KING: Senator George Brandis, can I bring you in here? And

Julia Gillard has signalled that in the next couple of  weeks we will know more of these details.

What is the detail that is most important to you to find

out?

BRANDIS: I think most people are most interested, I suppose, in

the price per tonne that the Government will set. But I  mean you know our position, as you know, Madonna,  is very simple. We opposed the carbon tax outright. I'm  a little surprised - well I'm a little concerned - that Craig  is one of the senior economic Ministers in the  government and was unable to answer the questions,  including who would even administer this tax, that were  put to him by your listeners.

But I mean the Coalition's position on this couldn't be

simpler. We think it's a thoroughly bad idea. It's a big  new tax dressed up as a reform. It's not a reform at all.  And if we were to be elected we will repeal it.

KING: You will repeal it.

BRANDIS: No doubt at all.

KING: Will you be able to do that? How difficult will it be?



Page:  5





BRANDIS: Well, we will make the carbon tax the issue at the next

election. And if we were to be elected promising to r …  asking people to vote for us on the promise that we  would repeal the carbon tax, we would expect the  Labor Party to respect our mandate to do so.

KING: Dr Craig Emerson, this issue it seems is really hurting

the popularity of the Prime Minister at the very least. Is  there a point where the Government says Ã¢ÂÂlook, we're  not taking the voters with us on this issueÃ¢ÂÂ. That Ã¢ÂÂwe do  need to sit around the cabinet table and reconsiderÃ¢ÂÂ?

EMERSON: No, and the reason … I say that is that this is not

something we're doing just for the heck of it; we're  doing it for the long-term future of this country. It is an  important reform. And mostly, reforms that have been  important in locking in future prosperity in this country  have been unpopular at the time …

KING: But is it worth losing government over?

EMERSON: … and governments have pressed ahead with them.

The Hawke Government did. The Keating Government  did.

KING: All right, but…

EMERSON: Even in some areas the Howard Government did.

KING: … but is it worth losing government over?

EMERSON: Well, Julia Gillard is not for turning on something like

this. We have been trying to put a price on carbon for a  very long time, and you might recall that Kevin Rudd as



Page:  6





Prime Minister sought to do so and then a whole lot of  pressure came on. And then he desisted.

We are persisting.

KING: All right. A couple of questions out of that, if I may. You

said Ã¢ÂÂwe've been trying to do this for a long timeÃ¢ÂÂ.  Talking to my listeners, one of the things that stuck  them is -   that's got them annoyed, some of them;  some of them are very supportive of it - is the fact that  they believed Julia Gillard saying there will be no  carbon tax.

EMERSON: A carbon tax is one way of putting a price on carbon.

And this is a fixed price, if it's a carbon tax. The  emissions trading scheme known as the ETS is  something not only that Labor has sought to implement  last time - made no secret of it, put it to the Senate  twice and it actually got blocked by a combination of  the Coalition and the Greens. But John Howard before  us took to the 2007 election, and even before that, the  necessity of an emissions trading scheme, putting a  price on carbon. And George fully supported it then.

KING: Well…

BRANDIS: Well, look I … can I come in on this discussion please,

Madonna? Look, Craig, I think that the debate has  moved on. And, you know, talking about what might  have happened in 2006 or 2007 or even in 2009, I  don't think people are very interested in that…

KING: Except for … can I just pull you up there, Senator

Brandis, because every time I raise the asylum-seeker  issue you hark back to 2005, 2006.



Page:  7





EMERSON: To 2001!

BRANDIS: No, but for a different reason: to demonstrate by the

clear statistical evidence that the policy suite we had in  place at that time was correct because it works.

That's the only reason. Now … but coming back to this

debate about the carbon tax.  What people now know,  which they didn't know then, was that according to the  Treasury's own modelling, the average household will  be at least $863 a year worse off. What they now know  …

EMERSON: YouÃ¢ÂÂre making that up.

BRANDIS: … which… no, it's what the Treasury modelling said,

what the Treasury paper said…

EMERSON: It depends upon the price, and the price has not been

set. You know that George. Don't try to mislead the  listeners.

BRANDIS: … but the Treasury paper took a mid-range price and

on the … as the most likely price,  and on the basis of  that, computed that the average household would start  $863 a year behind.

Now, if I may just go on.  A couple of weeks ago Mr

Combet, the Minister for Climate Change, was asked  not once, not twice, but three times Ã¢ÂÂwill most  households be better off or worse offÃ¢ÂÂ. And he was  unable to give an assurance they wouldn't be worse  off.

KING: All right. Now, there is some dispute over those figures.



Page:  8





The Climate Institute analysis says $250 worse off.

Another government analysis I know says $750 worse  off. Doesn't it depend on how much, how many people  and how much compensation people receive?

BRANDIS: Well, of course.  There are lots of variables. That's why

we want to know the details which the Government  hasn't been able to provide.

But, can I just make this point? It's a point Tony Abbott

made on the weekend: compensation is what you give  to people for injuring them. Why injure them in the first  place? For no good.

KING: Are you injuring your party's own chances of re-

election, Craig Emerson, by doing this?

EMERSON: Our interest is the national interest and we will press

ahead in the national interest. George conveniently  omitted from his reporting of Treasury analysis any  compensation. And, as I said before, that process …

BRANDIS: But you won't know what the compensation is.

EMERSON: …of course we will. When it's announced, you will

know and you'll criticise and condemn it ...

KING: All right.

EMERSON: There are some things that are certain in life. But in

terms of recent history, the reason it's relevant is that  Tony Abbott urged Malcolm Turnbull, as Leader of the  Opposition, to support the Government's Emissions  Trading Scheme.



Page:  9





KING: Okay, all right. I think we're going to leave this until a

couple of weeks time when we've got these details and  I would love if there was one special Inside Canberra  when we could get people to actually call and ask you  questions on this issue, because it's certainly cut  through…

EMERSON: Sounds like a good opportunity…

KING: Yeah.

EMERSON: … and I'd be very happy to do it.

BRANDIS: Well, I hope most of those questions are at Craig,

because any questions to me will rec… will elicit only  one answer:  vote for us and we'll repeal this

pernicious new tax.

KING: All right, well let's go to foreign ownership now,

because this is an issue that has been surfacing all  week. And I'll start with you George Brandis. Should  we have a full public register of who and what foreign  interests own what land in Australia?

BRANDIS: Well, I think there is a big issue about rural land and

foreign ownership of rural land, and for that reason a  few weeks ago the Coalition's agriculture spokesman,  Mr John Cobb, moved in the House of Representatives  for an audit of foreign ownership of rural land across  Australia. Now, the problem is, of course, Madonna,  that the registrars - the registries of title - are all run by  the state and territory governments, so it requires the  cooperation of the state and territory government.

But, you know, I think there's something to be said for -

and, you know, this is, this is one proposal, among



Page:  10





many - but there is something to be said for the states  and the territories cooperatively…

KING: All right.

BRANDIS: … requiring that the owner of particularly rural land to

identify on the Certificate of Title, whether they are a  foreign-controlled entity.

KING: All right, and indeed, that happens in Queensland.

BRANDIS: Yeah.

KING: But can I ask you George Brandis …  my question was

do you support a full public register of who in foreign …   what foreign interests own what land here in Australia?

BRANDIS: Well we … what we have asked…

KING: For instance, an audit. You've gone through that.

BRANDIS: For … is that … well, that's our position. I mean that is

our position: that there should be an audit of foreign  ownership …

KING: A public…

BRANDIS: …of rural land.

KING: Okay. Craig Emerson?

EMERSON: And Prime Minister Gillard has asked Assistant

Treasurer Bill Shorten and Agriculture Minister Joe  Ludwig to work with our statistical authorities in



Page:  11





seeking to collect the information on this. And once  we've got the basic information, we can make the next  set of decisions. But I think there's no problem with the  Australian public knowing who owns land.

KING: Well indeed, there's no problem…

EMERSON: The information is not a problem…

MADONNA KING: Yeah.

EMERSON: …as far as I'm concerned.

KING: Well information is a good thing, isn't it?

EMERSON: Yeah, usually it's a good thing.

KING: But even from a political point of view, do you think it's

… do you think it's a good thing, or a worrying thing, for  example, that these Chinese companies, for example,  with majority Chinese Government interests, are  buying up dozens of farms? Or that the UK and US can  express interest in our water licences? Other countries  can secure farms for milk supplies in future

generations, without even you having access to that  information?

EMERSON: Well, again, I'm quite positive about more information,

rather than less. But if we look at the history of  Australian agriculture, it's a history of foreign  ownership, starting with the UK. One of the biggest  investors in Australian agriculture has been the United  States of America.



Page:  12





KING: But no-one's saying that foreign ownership is a bad

thing, I think. It's whether we have knowledge of what  that foreign ownership involves.

EMERSON: Sure, … and I'm not passing judgement here. But you

use the phraseology “Chinese ownership of land”.  Well, look, foreign ownership is foreign ownership. If  it's by a government-owned corporation…

KING: Yes.

EMERSON: … then that has to be approved by the Foreign

Investment Review Board.

KING: If it's worth more than $200 million.

EMERSON: No, the $231 million threshold is for any acquisition of

land or other assets by a foreign corporation. If it's a  government-owned corporation, then it has to be  approved by the Foreign Investment Review Board.

BRANDIS: I think Madonna, as well, that land is a little different

from other categories of foreign investment. And I think  there - you know, there is - there are stronger  arguments to be made in the case of land, particularly  rural land, than there are in the case of other

categories of foreign investments as well. And although  Craig's right that there's always been  very, very heavy  foreign investment in Australian agriculture, I don't  think we want to see, and the Coalition certainly  doesn't want to see, a situation in which bit by bit all of  the rural land in Australia is owned by foreigners.

KING: That's Senator George Brandis with Dr Craig Emerson

as we go Inside Canberra this morning. A slightly  related issue: Tony Windsor is saying in The Australian



Page:  13





this morning that there's a collision coming between  the farm sector and the mining sector on sensitive  land, and it's certainly something I've picked up here in  South-East Queensland.

He's referring to mining projects. In Queensland it's

very much coal seam gas. Do either of your parties  federally have a view on just the mushrooming-up of  these permits for coal seam gas in Queensland and  how they should be dealt with?

EMERSON: Well, obviously, I'm going to say that it needs to be

handled sensitively. But the coal seam methane  industry is a great industry for Australia and working  with rural landholders is the way to do this. Often, it's  that the coal seam methane explorers just want to  have a look at what's underneath. And if there is  development, it's not a matter of quarantining and  ripping up the land. It's usually, and I would expect,   working with the rural landholders to keep the land in  production.

BRANDIS: I largely have the same approach to that, Madonna,

and that has been the approach of the State

Opposition here in Queensland as well. It's essentially  a land use issue in which there are different claimants.  There are the coal seam … the people who want to  develop the coal seam gas industry, and there are the  rural landowners. And, you know, they do come into  conflict, potentially, and …

KING: But there's also an environment issue. People are

saying the pollution of water …

BRANDIS: And … well, that's … there is an environmental issue

as well. But, frankly, I'm more concerned with the more



Page:  14





immediate interests of the people whose livelihoods  are at stake: the rural landowners.

Now, the Coalition supports, and the LNP supports, the

coal seam gas industry.

KING: Very strongly.

BRANDIS: Very strongly. But I think it's acknowledged by all the

stakeholders that their development of that industry  has to pay sufficient and appropriate regard for the  interests of the rural landowners.

EMERSON: And I agree with that. I imagine, though, Madonna, that

maybe people have in mind that the land all gets  ripped up like an open cut mine…

KING: No, no, no, they don't. No, no, no, they don't.

EMERSON: … or is it just the water issue - mainly, the water issue?

KING: They just don't like the idea that a permit … that they

don't have to get permission to get a permit to go onto  their land for exploration. And they're saying, Ã¢ÂÂit's our  land. We want to be, you know, once mining starts,  there can be compensation and a deal.Ã¢ÂÂ

EMERSON: Sure. Yeah.

KING: But they're saying, you know, you get a knock on the

door and saying we're going to do this. So it's more  about the rights of land-holders, I gather.



Page:  15





EMERSON: Yeah. And without wanting to pass the buck, those

sorts of approvals, I understand, are at the State  Government level.

KING: They are.

Eleven minutes to ten. Briefly now, to the power of the

Greens. It is going to be enhanced quite strongly in the  Senate very, very shortly. And I'm just wondering  [about] the biggest change you expect to see from that.  And if I can start with you, Senator George Brandis.

BRANDIS: The biggest change undoubtedly is that the Senate will

cease to operate as a house of review. Until tomorrow,  30 June, we have had a situation in which no party  controls the Senate. After Friday, and between Friday  and, you know, whenever the next federal election is,  the Labor-Greens alliance will have an absolute  majority of votes in the Senate and there will be no  brakes on them.

KING: Okay. So is this a good thing, Craig Emerson? It

provides some stability. And stuff you want to get  through, you'll be able to get through. Or are you going  to be tied up with positions that you have to negotiate  with the Greens?

EMERSON: Well, we'll have to negotiate with the Greens. We'll

have to negotiate with the Coalition.

BRANDIS: That's not [indistinct]…

EMERSON: And some matters will be settled with the Coalition and

other matters will be settled with the Greens.



Page:  16





BRANDIS: Look, look, look ...

EMERSON: Could I just finish mine? You've had your go. The idea

that it's no longer a house of review: we do recall  WorkChoices got through the Senate when the  Coalition had absolute control of the Senate. There  was no check at all on the Coalition between 2004 and  2007. They introduced WorkChoices without saying a  word before the election.

BRANDIS: Well, we're going …

EMERSON: So no lectures from you, George, about controlling the

Senate. You controlled the Senate and you, the  Coalition, abused it by passing WorkChoices.

BRANDIS: Well, we … we…

KING: Isn't that a good point, Senator George Brandis?

BRANDIS: We … yes, a very good point. We did the wrong thing.

We introduced WorkChoices without a mandate. But I  tell you what we didn't say. We didn't say, six days  before the 2004 election, Ã¢ÂÂthere will be no WorkChoices  under any government I leadÃ¢ÂÂ.

EMERSON: And it's on its way back.

BRANDIS: This Prime Minister said Ã¢ÂÂthere will be no carbon tax

under any government I leadÃ¢ÂÂ. So the one thing on any  reasonable view of democratic values, this  Government is not entitled to do is use the Senate  majority that they have got with the Greens to force a  carbon tax on an unwilling people.



Page:  17





EMERSON: [indistinct] Senate majority with the Greens.

KING: But isn't that a democracy, though?

BRANDIS: It's a democracy when governments are elected and

they keep their promises.

EMERSON: George …

BRANDIS: When a government goes to an election on a platform

of not introducing a carbon tax, it is anti-democratic for  them to introduce a carbon tax.

EMERSON: And I think that there needs to be a little passing

respect for the will of the people.

BRANDIS: Exactly.

EMERSON: The people who …

BRANDIS: Who voted against a carbon tax.

EMERSON: …elected this Senate.

KING: All right. Okay.

EMERSON: And you're going to have to get over it, George.

KING: No, no, no, I want to move on, if that's okay George?

BRANDIS: Well, I think I should be entitled to make …



Page:  18





EMERSON: I make a 10-second statement and he needs a two-

minute rebuttal.

BRANDIS: Hang on. Please don't think that there is an arm's

length relationship between the Labor Party and the  Greens. There is a formal written document of alliance.

KING: Okay. Do you want to respond to that, Craig Emerson,

very briefly?

EMERSON: Yes. WorkChoices is coming back because Peter Reith

said it is.

BRANDIS: I'm sorry.

KING: All right.

EMERSON: And he's working with Josh Frydenberg and Jamie

Briggs.

KING: Okay. Okay.

EMERSON: And that's what would happen under Tony Abbott.

MADONNA KING: And I want to get to IR and WorkChoices in just a

moment. Before that, just to finish the Greens issue, if  you were to describe Senator Bob Brown, the Leader  of the Greens, what word would you use, Craig  Emerson?

EMERSON: Articulate.

BRANDIS: Pre-industrial.



Page:  19





KING: Okay. All right. And perhaps you want to join that

discussion this morning, too. Articulate and pre-industrial, from Senator George Brandis.

Now, Senator George Brandis, I do want to address

this IR issue just raised by Craig Emerson.

BRANDIS: Sure.

KING: Big business in the SMH this morning are calling for

changes to IR. This is after Peter Reith criticised Tony  Abbott for being too scared to go after reforms. Is he?

BRANDIS: Is what, sorry?

KING: Tony Abbott too scared to go after big reforms in IR?

BRANDIS: We … our position is that there will not be major

changes to the industrial relations structure of the  country.

KING: But that's not the question I'm asking you. I'm asking

you…

BRANDIS: No, no, Tony Abbott's not too scared. But what we are

wary of is the sort of dishonesty we just heard from  Craig who said, quote, “WorkChoices is coming back”,  unquote, with no reason to say so. We have given an  iron-clad commitment that WorkChoices is not coming  back. And the problem we have is that if the Liberal  Party were to make even the most minimal changes to  industrial relations laws, the trade union movement and  Labor politicians like Craig will begin a lying campaign.  They're saying WorkChoices is coming back. Now …



Page:  20





KING: But isn't Tony Abbott signalling that? He says he'll

have an IR policy in place before the next election.

BRANDIS: Well, we will have. And, of course, we will have policies

across the whole range.

KING: So, are you saying it won't change?

BRANDIS: There will be no significant changes made to the

industrial relations laws by the Coalition.

KING: Does that settle that for you, Dr Craig Emerson?

EMERSON: Not at all.

BRANDIS: No, of course not.

EMERSON: The terminology “iron-clad commitment” in fact was

used by Tony Abbott when he said he wouldn't tamper  with the Medicare safety net. He said it was a rock-solid, iron-clad commitment.

KING: Okay.

EMERSON: Straight after the election, he tampered with it.

KING: Well, back to you, George Brandis.

BRANDIS: There you go again, Craig.

KING: On this, where do you think the Government's IR policy

is not working; that you would want to significantly  change?



Page:  21





BRANDIS: Well, we don't want to significantly change it.

EMERSON: Well, hold on. Peter Reith …

KING: Well, some people in …

BRANDIS: But Peter Reith is … Peter Reith, Craig, has not been a

Member of Parliament for 10 years. Peter Reith is a  retired gentleman …

KING: He almost became president of the party.

BRANDIS: … who last weekend failed to become the federal

president of the Liberal Party. He's entitled to his  views.

EMERSON: That's right.

BRANDIS: There is a variety of views. But I'm telling you what the

policy of the Coalition is.

EMERSON: Could I respond? Could I respond?

KING: No, Craig Emerson. But, George Brandis, do you

concede there is a feeling in the party or the party is  split over this issue…

BRANDIS: No, I don't think the …

KING: … on whether it should go further on IR or not?

BRANDIS: I don't think the party is split at all. In a party room of

about 100 people, there will be a variety of views on a



Page:  22





whole pile of issues. That's not the question. The  question is what is our policy.

KING: Craig Emerson?

CRAIG EMERSON: Peter Reith said in an opinion piece yesterday that

three weeks ago, not 10 years ago, that he and Tony  Abbott came to an agreement that if he, Peter Reith,  became party president, he would not say anything  publicly about industrial relations, but that they would  re-visit…

BRANDIS: That's a lie.

EMERSON: … the industrial relations issue.

BRANDIS: That's a lie. You said that on Sky News yesterday.

EMERSON: It was in the opinion piece.

BRANDIS: And after you said that on Sky News yesterday, I re-

read the opinion piece. He did not say that. And what  you have just said, Craig, it's so sad for me to say …

KING: What was he saying then?

BRANDIS: … is a lie. What he wrote in the opinion piece is that he

gave Tony Abbott an assurance that if he became  party president he would not be speaking in public  about industrial relations. Not that there was some deal  between them or that there had been anything done  quiet, but merely …

EMERSON: That he would continue to pursue it.



Page:  23





BRANDIS: … but merely that he gave Tony Abbott an assurance.

EMERSON: That he would continue to pursue it.

BRANDIS: To say that a statement that he gave somebody a

private assurance in a deal is a lie.

KING: Did he give a kind of assurance? Did he say that?

EMERSON: It does exactly sound like a deal to me.

KING: Did he say that he'd given a private assurance?

BRANDIS: That in the event that he became president of the

Liberal Party, he would not speak publicly about  industrial relations, and that's all he said.

EMERSON: But that he would continue to pursue it.

KING: But doesn't that raise the idea that there is a

disagreement?

EMERSON: Exactly.

BRANDIS: But it's a [indistinct]…

EMERSON: Thanks for calling me a liar, George. Just re-read the

piece.

BRANDIS: Just …I'm up …just  … you just need to [indistinct] ..

EMERSON: Well, mate, I know you're trying to stop me, but…



Page:  24





KING: We'll let people  … we'll let…

EMERSON: … I do resent being called a liar three times …

BRANDIS: Well, you just  … well…

EMERSON: … when I'm simply replicating what happened in an

opinion piece.

KING: All right.

BRANDIS: Look, look, look, Mr … it's an academic argument

because Mr Reith failed to become president of the  Liberal Party and we re-elected Mr  …

KING: He still got a lot of support. He only lost by one vote.

EMERSON: That's right.

BRANDIS: But he lost. I mean, we only have this election once a

year. He's not the president.

KING: All right. George Brandis, you've had your say. Craig

Emerson?

EMERSON: It's not academic because Tony Abbott agreed to keep

his head down on industrial relations but actually wants  to pursue industrial relations changes to bring back the  worst elements of WorkChoices.

BRANDIS: That's a lie. That's another lie.

EMERSON: We all know that.



Page:  25





BRANDIS: You've got to stop telling lies, Craig.

KING: Well, you've made that point, Senator George Brandis.

EMERSON: Yeah, you called me a liar about six times, George.

BRANDIS: Well, stop telling lies.

EMERSON: Yeah, well …

KING: Do you want to call George Brandis something before

we stop?

EMERSON: Off-air probably would be better.

KING: [Laughs] And I think we do need to leave it there. Can

we shake hands? We usually try and end on  something nice.

BRANDIS: Just stick to the truth and we'll get on fine.

EMERSON: George, don't be a hypocrite.

KING: Richard Fidler, are you able to actually…

RICHARD FIDLER: I've just walked in. I don't know.

EMERSON: HowÃ¢ÂÂs your poofle valve?

FIDLER: Cakes and tea - yeah. I don't know.

KING: Cakes and tea.

EMERSON: IÃ¢ÂÂm just going to examine your poofle valve.

No, it's all right. Does that hurt?

FIDLER: I'm being assaulted by a federal politician

here.

KING: Senator - every Wednesday. Senator George

Brandis, thank you for your time.

BRANDIS: Thanks, Madonna.

KING: Dr Craig Emerson, thank you.

EMERSON: Thanks, Madonna.
