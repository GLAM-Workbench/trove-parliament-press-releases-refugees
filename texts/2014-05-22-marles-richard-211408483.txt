THE HON RICHARD MARLES MP  SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND  BORDER PROTECTION  MEMBER FOR CORIO

MEDIA RELEASE

GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO COME CLEAN ON CAMBODIA DEAL



Shadow Minister for Immigration and Border Protection Richard Marles has called  on the Abbott Government to come clean on the details of a refugee  resettlement arrangement it appears to be negotiating with Cambodia.



The only information we have so far is coming from the Cambodian Prime  Minister.



It is completely unacceptable that the Immigration Minister Scott Morrison  continues to keep the Australian public in the dark about his proposed  arrangement to resettle asylum seekers in Cambodia.



Labor is calling on Mr Morrison to provide immediate and comprehensive  information about the proposal including detailing what safeguards will be in  place to ensure the safety of people resettled.



The Immigration Minister must also explain why he believes Cambodia is an  acceptable location for resettlement when he so fervently denounced Labor’s  Malaysia solution.



Labor has serious concerns about Mr Morrison’s capacity to manage another  regional arrangement given his disastrous handling of the Manus Island facility.



It is 22 days since the deadline for releasing the report into the events of 16-18  February at Manus Island that resulted in the death of Reza Berati have passed  and we still know nothing about what occurred.



Mr Morrison needs to release the report into Manus Island and satisfy the  Australian public he is capable of managing such an important arrangement  before striking a new one.
