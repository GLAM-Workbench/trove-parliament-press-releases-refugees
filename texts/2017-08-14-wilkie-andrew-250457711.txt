Bill of Rights introduced into Parliament





The Independent Member for Denison, Andrew Wilkie, will today introduce legislation in  the Federal Parliament that would enshrine a Bill of Rights in Australian law.

WHEN: Approximately 10:25am TODAY 14 August  WHERE: House of Representatives (watch live at  http://www.aph.gov.au/News_and_Events/Watch_Parliament)

The bill is modelled closely on previous legislative attempts to introduce a Bill of Rights,  including most recently the Australian Bill of Rights Bill 2001.

“A federal Bill of Rights is necessary to ensure that the Federal and state governments  respect human rights and that power-hungry politicians don’t infringe those rights,” Mr  Wilkie said.

“Many members of the community agree that we need a Bill of Rights. The Australian  Human Rights Commission, the Human Rights Law Centre, the National Aboriginal and  Torres Strait Islander Legal Services and the Refugee Council of Australia have all supported  a Bill of Rights at some point.

“The Bill of Rights would prevail over any Commonwealth, State or Territory law that  infringes on the rights and freedoms that it outlines. It would also allow individuals who feel  that their rights have been infringed upon to object to the Human Rights Commission and  seek a solution through the courts.

“I call on the Government and the Opposition to support this bill and bring Australia into line  with other countries.”
