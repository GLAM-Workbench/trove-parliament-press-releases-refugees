LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION  THE HON. TONY ABBOTT MHR  FEDERAL MEMBER FOR WARRINGAH

31 January 2012

TRANSCRIPT OF THE HON. TONY ABBOTT MHR   Q&A SESSION - THE NATIONAL PRESS CLUB OF AUSTRALIA,  CANBERRA

E&OE……………………….……………………………………………………………

QUESTION:

Mark Riley, Seven Network. Mr Abbott, thanks very much for your address. I just want to take to your part  of it… take you to a part of it where you talk about the Medicare-funded dentistry at $4 billion a year being  an aspiration and not a commitment. People, I think, at the moment are finding it hard to believe government  commitments. How can they believe in aspiration of $4 billion a year? It doesn't just mean it’s unaffordable  or is this a new way of ensuring that you can't be held accountable for breaking a promise, you just don't  make it in the first place? But one promise that you have held there is the paid parental leave scheme in  saying that you're going to lower taxes and that business is doing it so tough. Why is it the right time for  business to be hit with a $2.7 billion new tax?

TONY ABBOTT:

Thank you Mark for that question and it is good to see that the tough questions are being asked here at the  Press Club, particularly by you, Mark. Look, I think it is very important that people understand that we put  in the hard yards to deliver a stronger economy for a reason, for a reason. Governments don't try to go into  surplus because they like seeing money in the Reserve Bank. Governments go into surplus because it then  enables them to give better services to the Australian people, including tax cuts.

Now, I think this is very important. In the end, we are in government to deliver a better life to the Australian  people and paid parental leave will be better for the Australian people. It will demonstrate, apart from  anything else, that the Coalition finally gets it when it comes to the rights and aspirations of women in the  work force. Better disability services are important, very important, if we are going to give to vulnerable  Australians the better life that they need and, yes, a better dental service is important too, very important. It  has been important to me for a very long time, particularly since my time as Health Minister, when I was  able to make a start in this direction.

Now, the important thing to remember is that we can only have these better services if we get the economy  right, if we get the fiscal situation under control. But there’s got to be a light at the end of the tunnel and that  is what I want the Australian people to understand - that there will be a light at the end of the tunnel. I think  the next few years are going to be very tough. I think this is going to be a very tough year for our economy. I  think getting the fiscal position under control is going to be very difficult but we aren't just doing it because  we are bean counters, we're doing it because we're patriots and we want to build a better Australia.





QUESTION:

Mark Simkin, ABC News.  Mr Abbott, you're an Opposition Leader that is sometimes criticised for  opposing. This speech was billed as a positive vision but you still have managed to call the Government  lazy, deceptive, complacent and…..

TONY ABBOTT:

….and you’re disputing that, are you?

QUESTION:

I’m simply trying to reconcile the motivation for the speech. Do you see the need for some sort of political  reinvention, some sort of Tony 2.0 or do you see this year as, looking at the polls, more of the same?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, I’m certainly not going to be a commentator on the polls because there are lots of people in this room  who are employed to be commentators on the polls. I certainly think that the Coalition has been very good at  demonstrating to the Australian people that this is the worst Government in living memory. We even had a  situation the other day when Robert Manne, no friend of the Coalition, no kind of knee-jerk conservative  described the current Prime Minister as the least impressive incumbent since Billy McMahon. So, we do  have a seriously deficient Government. What I want to do today is to encourage people to believe that it  doesn't have to be this bad. That if they change the Government, they won't just be changing from one bunch  of squalid fixes to another, but they will be changing to a government which is competent, which is adult,  which is principled which is inspired by high ideals and which has good experience so that you can trust us  to practically competently deliver the things that people expect of a decent Australian Government.

QUESTION:

Laura Tingle from the Financial Review Mr Abbott. You’ve quoted Abraham Lincoln in your speech,  saying that he knew in the marrow of his bones that government should do for people what they can't do for  themselves and no more. You’ve also talked about an ambition to permanently reduce the size of  government. Just doing a rough calculation of spending cuts and new spending commitments, you're talking  about cutting spending by about $12 billion and increasing spending by about $10 billion. My question to  you is; when you say you want to permanently reduce the size of government, are you talking about a  profound change in the role of government in Australian society or are you talking about just getting rd of  waste? And when you talk about more tax cuts, are you talking about more personal income tax cuts beyond  cutting the carbon tax and mining tax?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well look, I believe, as all members of the Liberal National Coalition do, in smaller government, lower  taxes and greater freedom - that’s just part of our DNA. Now, I also accept, as all members of the Coalition  do, there is an important role for government but government should be slow to get involved in new areas,  unless it is convinced, first, that there is a real problem, and second, that there is a real problem that  government action can realistically, practically, feasibly improve.

Now, one of the reasons why I am dead against the carbon tax is that it will involve a permanent one percent  increase in the size of government. Now, I think there are much better ways of tackling emissions, much  better ways of tackling climate issues than permanently increasing the size of government. Ditto the mining  tax - the mining tax will permanently increase the size of government.

So I think government should be as big as it needs to be to realistically address problems that only  government can solve, but no bigger than that and that’s the sensible, pragmatic, small ‘c’ conservative  approach that I want to bring to the problems of Australian Government.

QUESTION:

The second half was just about more tax cuts beyond mining tax and carbon tax?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, the point about more tax cuts is that you have got to be able to pay for them and that means that the  budget has got to be in a vastly better position than it is in now. I mean at the moment, the Government is  still borrowing $100 million every single day and borrowing for tax cuts strikes me as a very poor piece of  public policy.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, Phillip Hudson from the Herald Sun. In your speech you devoted a section to economic  management where you talk about taking pressure off households and you say that you want there to be less  upward pressure on interest rates. I’m wanting to clarify, are you pledging that interest rates under an Abbott  government will be lower than they are under a Gillard Government and is that a promise, an aspiration or a  guarantee?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I can certainly promise that spending under an Abbott government will be less and that means that  borrowing should be less and that means that there should be less upward pressure on interest rates.  Obviously interest rates at any one time are a function of market forces, but it is not a market which is  uninfluenced by government, and if government is out there borrowing big time, as the current Government  is, that obviously means that there is less money available to private businesses, less money available to  home buyers.

QUESTION:

G’day Mr Abbott. Welcome back to the Press Club.

TONY ABBOTT:

Thank you for having me Phil.

QUESTION:

Just back on tax cuts, you said in your speech by the end of your first term you wanted more tax cuts in  prospect and then just what you told Laura, that you’re going to have to pay for them. Are you saying that  those tax cuts you have promised people, in the absence of a carbon tax, will have to wait until the budget is  back in surplus? Whereas the Government is saying they’re going to introduce them from May this year.  You’re not going to introduce them….minus the carbon tax, until you’ve got a surplus budget?

TONY ABBOTT:

We will deliver tax cuts without a carbon tax. The precise timing and the precise quantum is something that  we will announce in good time before the next election.



QUESTION:

Hi Mr Abbott, Matthew Franklin from The Australian. You're not in government but you are one of the  nation's political leaders. You have refused to deal with or been unable to find a deal with the Government  over the issue of boat people. My question to you is; given that the Labor Government has bent over  backwards to compromise its own policy to try and find common ground with you, doesn't your refusal to do  so simply confirm Julia Gillard's claim that you are Dr No and that you feel you have no responsibility to the  national interest in this issue?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, Matt, I just reject your statement that the Government has bent over backwards to accommodate the  Coalition. This is completely wrong, completely, utterly and absolutely wrong. Wayne Swan said, just  before Christmas, that the Government would never, never, introduce temporary protection visas - and they  are a critical element of our plan. If the Government had been serious about reintroducing the Nauru  detention centre, they would have been over there before Christmas talking to the Nauruan Government.  They weren't, instead, they have plucked an utterly fanciful figure out of the air for the cost of rebuilding the  centre - rebuilding the centre is going to cost a tiny fraction of the $1.5 billion plus that the Government is  saying - the Government seriously expects us to believe that it is going to cost more to rebuild and run a  processing centre on Nauru than it would to build the Fiona Stanley Hospital in Perth. I mean, it is just  completely, utterly, implausible. So look, they are not serious at all. They were never serious. They were just  going through this charade of trying to involve the Opposition in their problem, of trying to fit up, if you  like, the Opposition with a failure which is absolutely and utterly of their own making.

Now, the point I make in conclusion is that it is the responsibility of the Opposition to support good policy.  It is not the responsibility of the Opposition to support bad policy from a bad Government and the Malaysia  people swap is bad policy and it will never be supported by this Coalition.

QUESTION:

Chris Johnson from The Canberra Times, Mr Abbott. You touched briefly in your speech on foreign policy,  particularly you said that you want to avoid the big talk without the actions to match and that you wanted a  foreign policy that would have a Jakarta focus, not a Geneva one. Does that mean that any government that  you lead will downgrade Australia's participation in some of the larger multilateral [inaudible] that we are  currently a part of?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, you shouldn't assume that focusing on our region and areas where we can make a difference will mean  a downgrade in our participation in international organisations because sometimes, sometimes participation  in those international organisations strengthens our regional clout, it doesn't reduce our regional clout. But  I’ve got to make this basic point, that in the end, everything we do will be guided by our interests and our  values and the problem with some of the international organisations is that for all their good intentions, for  all the worthy sentiments that they espouse, they aren't really that good at promoting the deep and lasting  values of our people, our culture and our civilisation.

QUESTION:

Paul Bongiorno, Ten News, Mr Abbott. There’s no doubt that the optics of minority governments are  disconcerting for the Australian electorate, if you can believe all the published opinion polls.  But just  getting away from optics and perceptions, how do we condemn a Government for being incompetent when it  has AAA credit ratings by all three rating agencies, when interest rate are 4.25 percent now, compared to  6.75 per cent when the Howard Government lost office and the Government points out that that is a $3,000 a  year saving for people on an average mortgage of $300,000? By these yardsticks, and maybe there are

others, the Government is politically incompetent, I would happily concede, but economically, it is  delivering.

TONY ABBOTT:

Paul, my response is that no competent Government would have been responsible for the pink batts  programme. No competent Government would have rushed out with the school hall programme. No  competent Government would have dreamt up the National Broadband Network on the back of a coaster in a  VIP aircraft because the Prime Minister wouldn't take the time to see the Minister to have a proper  discussion. I mean, really and truly this Government is almost a poster child for ineptitude and failure of  process and if our economic position is strong, and relatively speaking it still is, it owes everything to the  reforms of its predecessors and nothing to the spending spree of the current Government.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, Shane Wright from The West Australian and a declaration of interest. I am a P&F treasurer here  in Canberra and I am asking you about the education refund proposal that you’ve got and you’ve mentioned  in your speech about the iron law of economics. If you, under your proposal to allow people to claim school  fees, aren't you just telling two million households who get Family Tax Benefit A and their schools, that it is  alright to raise fees because the Federal Government will pay for that? Isn't it an inflationary problem that  you are going to create by allowing people to claim school fees?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I’m not against aspiration. I think aspiration is very important. I think one of the real problems with  the current Government is that everyone who tries to get ahead suddenly becomes a target. Private health  insurance, earning more than $100,000 or $150,000, you're a target. Child care user, earning more than a  certain amount, you're a target. I think this is a Government which needs to understand that encouraging  people and institutions to change for the better is a good thing, not a bad thing.

Now, I know that a lot of people pay school fees - sometimes they're the fees that are necessarily incurred if  you go to an independent school, sometimes they're the voluntary fees that you incur at a state school, but  one way or another they're a cost and I think that it’s right to give people some help to deal with the costs of  giving their kids the best possible start in life.

QUESTION:

Paul Osborne, from Australian Associated Press, thanks for coming back Mr Abbott.

TONY ABBOTT:

Thank you Paul.

QUESTION:

The Shadow Cabinet is due to meet, I believe, on Thursday. One of the issues may be industry policy which  has been the subject of some, sort of, backroom chat and some media stories over the past few months. Just  wanting to get your view on why do you see that industry assistance is something that needs cutting in order  to balance the budget and, when there is….seems to be some evidence that it supports many direct and  indirect jobs in manufacturing, particularly in the car industry?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well look, I’m a big supporter of the car industry. I think it would be a tragedy for Australia if we didn't  have a car industry. I think a car industry is one of the signs that we remain a first world economy. So, I

want to see the car industry flourish. All the Coalition has done is say that the automotive transformation  scheme should have the same quantum of funding now as the Howard Government believed it should have,  that the $500 that the current Government put in that scheme, as part of its panicky overreaction to the first  global financial crisis, is not necessary.

So, I am in favour of car industry support, I just think it needs to be based on long-term rational decision-making, not on panicky overreactions to short-term events. I should make two final points about car industry  support. The only political party in this country that has reneged on clear commitments to the car industry is  the Labor Party, which has reneged on $1.4 billion of pledged assistance and the best thing you can do for  the car industry is not to have a carbon tax, because a carbon tax will add more than $400 to the price of  every car produced in Australia and, obviously, that gives foreign cars a big advantage over the locally  produced model.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, Kieran Gilbert from Sky News. I did have a question on costings, but I’ve got an email from a  parent, a viewer who is a father of a kid with disability, cerebral palsy, and he asked me to ask you a  question, so I thought this was a better question than I had. He says, can you please ask Mr Abbott why he's  putting the National Disability Insurance Scheme on the backburner, describing it as an aspirational policy  until the budget is back in the black? He says that you're contradicting your own words, that society is  judged on how it treats its most vulnerable. He is worried that if it is on the backburner, that that would  simply torpedo the proposal. What do you say to him and people like him?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, there is a process which the current Government has announced and which the Coalition supports.  There is a scoping study currently under way. There are various studies and work being undertaken by the  Council of Australian Governments because this does have to involve both the states and the  Commonwealth and let's wait and see what comes out of that process. I think this is an important and  necessary reform. I think it really is a test of our quality as a society what we can do, more and better, for  people with disabilities, but we do have to accept that, in the end, everything has got to be paid for and it  would be so much easier to pay for important and necessary reforms, like disability insurance, if we didn't  have the waste and extravagance which we have seen almost every day from the current Government.

MICHELLE GRATTAN:

Michelle Grattan from The Age. Mr Abbott, can I take you back to indigenous affairs. Do you see any  realistic chance of getting agreement on the wording of a referendum to recognise indigenous people to be  put either before the election or at this next election? If you don't, would you commit to, as prime minister,  restarting the process to put such a referendum?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well Michelle, first point I want to make is that I think it would be better if any such referendum could be a  stand alone vote. I think that the question of indigenous recognition, anything to do with the long-term  reconciliation of Australian-to-Australian is best pursued outside the partisan ranker of an election campaign  - so that is the first point I want to make.

The second point I want to make is that the Coalition is a long time, long-term supporter of indigenous  recognition - it is often forgotten that that was part of the preamble that was put to the people in 1999 along  with the constitutional question…. along with the Republic question - and then in 2007, in one of the last  significant commitments he made before the election campaign, John Howard committed us to this back  then. So look, we are long-term supporters of this.

I would like to think that any question that was put to the people would be a unifying moment rather than a  divisive issue in our national life. I think the aspiration would have to be the kind of coming together that we  saw over the 1967 referendum question and my fear, at the moment, is that the recommendations that we  have got from the committee rather overreach.

Now, we have indicated a desire to take this process forward, but to do so in a way that is likely to gain  overwhelming consensus support and George Brandis and myself, Senator Scullion and myself will be  happy to engage with the Government, will be happy to engage with indigenous people, will be happy to do  what we can to try and make this happen, but the worst thing that we could do right now would be to put a  referendum forward on such a sensitive subject and have it fail.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, Richard Davis from SBS TV News. I wanted to ask you an introspective question and at the risk  of it sounding like a job interview…

TONY ABBOTT:

….do I look like an introvert Richard?

QUESTION:

Not at all, no. As a politician, what do you think is your greatest strength and what do you think is your  greatest weakness?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, my first boss in politics was John Hewson and John Hewson had a phrase, he said "don't practice  open heart surgery on yourself in public”. So, I am going to take the Hewson advice on that and decline.  Lane, I think you're the lucky last, aren't you?

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, Lane Calcutt from the Nine Network. Given that Andrew Wilkie has indicated he would only  support a no confidence motion on matters of, I think he said serious misconduct. I’m just wondering if you  have spoken to him about that, as to what he thinks constitutes that. Do you think there are at the moment  grounds to move one and will you move one next week?

TONY ABBOTT:

Lane, the short answer is no, I haven't specifically raised this with Andrew Wilkie. I have a good dialogue  with Andrew Wilkie. I think he's a decent human being. I think he's an honourable man, by his own lights,  and I applaud the way he's stood up for the things he believes in over the last couple of weeks. Look, I  would never lightly move a motion of no confidence in the Government. My fundamental objective is not to  win votes in the Parliament, it is to deliver a better government to our country and my problem with a no  confidence motion in the near future is that Julia Gillard is firewalled by the presence in the parliament of a  certain Craig Thomson, Member for Dobell.

Now, I just want to dwell on this for a moment, because there are very serious allegations against Mr  Thomson. The 70,000 lowly paid workers of the Health Services Union really do deserve to be treated with  more respect than I think our system has currently treated them. The Fair Work Australia investigation has  now been going for three long years. Now, the Fitzgerald Royal Commission in Queensland went for, I  think, well under three years, the Wood Royal Commission in New South Wales, again, well under three  years, the Cole Royal Commission into the building industry, just 18 months;  I fail to see why this  investigation is taking so long. I fail to see why there has apparently been such lack of cooperation between

Fair Work Australia and the New South Wales and Victorian police and I just make the point that, as things  stand, as things stand, this looks like an institutional go slow to help the Government.

Now, I think that is not a very happy judgement to pass on important institutions and I think while Mr  Thomson stays in the parliament, it is highly unlikely that the numbers would be there for a successful no  confidence motion.
