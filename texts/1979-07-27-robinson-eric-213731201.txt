OPENING ADDRESS TO THE LAWASIA INSTITUTE SEMINAR  SYDNEY - 27 JULY 1979

Mr Chairman

Thank you for your invitation to officially open your Seminar.

In today's world, trade and overseas investment assume a critical

role in international' development. Almost instant communication

has brought countries much closer together and speeded up the

process of inter-dependence. It is particularly so within the

region in which our two countries are located.

While your discussions will be orientated towards legal aspects

of commerce between Australia and the Philippines I am sure you

will appreciate that any such bilateral arrangements must

recognise, and be consistent, with, our wider involvement in the

South East Asia-Pacific region and the world economy,

Australia and the Philippines share major objectives of peace

and progress in our common region. As a major regional country

sharing Australia's market oriented economic philosophy, as an

increasingly significant trading partner, and as a member of

ASEAN, the Philippines has come to occupy an important place

in Australia's policies towards the region.

The visit of the Prime Minister, Mr Fraser, to the Philippines

last May and the talks he undertook with President Marcos make

it very clear that, as members of the same region we have joint

desire and determination to work together.

We are seeking to strengthen links with the ASEAN countries and

with ASEAN itself. The invasion of Kampuchea and the refugee

crisis haye focussed attention on immediate common concerns in

the region.

These concerns respect for sovereign independence and for

stability - have been recently re-emphasised by the ASEAN

Foreign Ministers in Bali and endorsed there by my colleague,

the Australian Foreign Minister.

The recently concluded bilateral nuclear safeguards agreement

opens the way for negotiations for the supply of Australian

uranium to the Philippines and demonstrates that we intend to

cooperate closely on energy matters.

The growing cooperation between Australia and the Philippines

is further highlighted in the recent signing of a double taxation

agreement and the ratification of the 1975 Trade Agreement.

Over the past five years bilateral trade between our two

countries has increased noticeably. The trade imbalance has

decreased largely as a result of a rapid growth in Philippine

exports to Australia.  This growth exceeds the average of that

of other Australian imports. It has been noticeable even in

areas of some sensitivity for Australian industries.

Over the years we have taken a number of initiatives to encourage

the expansion .of trade.

For example, there is a well-established system of according

developing countries preferential tariff rates, on a range of

products which helps them overcome some of the disabilities in

competing with developed countries for a share of the Australian

market. We have made special efforts to help ASEAN countries

through such measures as the Trade Fair held in Sydney last year.

These policies have worked together with initiatives taken by

the developing countries of Asia to find market outlets for a

broadening range and increasing volume of exports.

Their success is reflected in the growth of imports into

Australia.

There is, however, one issue which could jeopardise our joint

efforts to increase trade in this region and indeed international!

That is inflation; inflation is our greatest enemy - by ours I

refer not only to Australia but to all nations with whom we

live and trade.

High rates of inflation are a significant element in the slower

growth in the volume of international trade and in market

opportunities for all countries,  particuarly developing ones.

It is therefore essential for all countries to pursue fiscal

and monetary policies which are designed to bring inflation

under control.

We are totally committed to anti-inflationary policies and like

to see our trading partners have a similar approach.

Our policies are being successful and we do not intend to

1  fritter1  away the very real gains we have made.

We will continue to pursue policies whose overall objective is

to control inflation in this country.

We also believe that economic recovery in Australia will only

be achieved by placing more of our resources in the hands of

private individuals and businessmen.

In the past too many of Australia's resources have been

appropriated by Governments.

This has deprived private enterprise of the means of undertaking

the types of activities which can greatly contribute to our Â·

future prosperity.

Successive Australian Governments have found it relatively easy

to expand expenditure but rather more difficult to control it.

That is not for the want of resolution on our part. Far from it.

It is a reflection of the realities of the inflexibility of

some community attitudes,  institutional arrangements and

sectional interests.

4

C:

None the less we have sought to establish whether all programs

and activities are still required or whether they could not be

more efficiently carried out in some other way or at less cost

to the budget and to the taxpayer.

We will continue with this approach.

These reviews have not always won us friends but it is the only

w a y ,  in the long run,  of limiting the burden of the Government's

call on resources, in particular, taxation.

This we believe, will restore confidence in the private sector

and provide access to,resources which should provide the

necessary incentive to invest and adjust to changing economic

situations.

It is the Government's firm intention therefore to continue to

maintain maximum restraint of budget expenditures.

This will hasten domestic economic recovery and help resist the

continuing pressure of inflation.

I have referred to the need to deal with inflation and the

necessity to further restrict Government expenditure because

I believe that these policies are essential if we are to

establish a sound and reliable basis for our trade and

commercial dealings with other countries - especially those

within our region.

One of the major issues to be discussed by you is trade

liberalisation.

It was encouraging to see some progress in lowering tariffs on

manufactured goods in the recent Multilateral Trade Negotations.

It was however, disappointing to see the lack of any real

progress in liberalising trade in agricultural products.

As a trading nation, we seek to secure the benefits of

international specialisation and comparative advantage.

We do not seek to retreat into protectionism. Quite the

reverse; we are committed to greater trade liberalisation.

We have encouraged and will continue to encourage industry to

adjust to the rapidly changing international situation.

We cannot, however, expect industry to adjust overnight. Our

manufacturing sector has been under pressure for some years.

To some extent that is a legacy of past policy decisions. '

But we have to look to the future.

These considerations are highly relevant to the future

development of the South East Asian-Pacific region. There

seems no doubt that the remainder of this century will see a

tremendous upsurge in production, trade and living standards

in that region. ,  Â·

I believe Australia has an extremely important role in the Ã¢ÂÂ

region as a stable, reliable and secure supplier of basic

materials and energy resources and as a growing market.

In addition, I hope that with increased specialisation there

would be scope for greater trade in manufactured products and

in other commercial areas such as consultancy, finance and

tourism.

Developments of this kind will depend importantly on the efforts

each of us makes in our countries. 1

Australia of course, shares certain developing country

characteristics being a major commodity producer and a net

capital and technology importer.

6

We are aware of the Philippines' need for overseas investment.

From its own experience, Australia is acutely aware of' the

significant contribution to economic growth that direct overseas

investment can make, particularly when accompanied by technical

know-how and technical skills.

Just as we favour significant local equity and joint ventures

with overseas participants, we would like to see similar

arrangements with Australian capital in the Philippines.

The trade pattern emerging is for Australia to rely increasingly

on developing countries, including ASEAN, for the products of

labour-intensive industries and for a growing reliance by

developing countries on Australia's medium-sized higher

technology industries.

At the same time, the technological and managerial experience

of Australia, particularly in medium-sized industry, offers

prospects for future joint venture partnerships with ASEAN

enterprises.

The future ASEAN-Australia commercial relationship however will

be influenced by the development of bilateral relations between

our Governments and the development of intra-ASEAN arrangements.

Unfortunately Governments have been expected to assume a

dominant role in day to day commercial dealings to 'better

organise and regulate1  their economies.

Assumption of such a dominant position has inevitably placed

.  Governments under increasing pressure to provide ready-made

solutions for the economic ills of our societies. '

It also results in more legislation, more legal counsel, more

advisers, more consultants, and unfortunately very often,  more  confusion. - -

It is therefore not surprising that those engaged in commerce

should make a plea .for less regulation, greater simplification

>x of codes of commercial behaviour and less Government intervention.

I have no doubt that this issue will be considered by you

today.

Mr Chairman,

The Philippines and Australia have many common concerns and

common interests and no doubt a common appreciation of the

challenges that are before us.

We live in a dynamic region. One with a tremendous potential

for growth and influence on the world scene.

Mutual understanding and co-operation will continue to further

all our interests including those of a commercial nature.

Perhaps in this way we can facilitate our dealings with less .

regulation and legal complexity so that there can be a freer

exchange of ideas, initiatives,  information, trade and finance.

I hope your endeavours today can help bring this about.

I wish you every success and hope that this is a forerunner to

many more similar interchanges.

I have no doubt that they can only promote greater understanding

in our commercial relationships. .

If we work together we can surmount any difficulties which exist.

The relationship, therefore, which we wish to develop with the

Philippines is only one .which can benefit our two countries

and is also one which will be in the interest of the region

within which we live and trade.

It therefore gives me great pleasure to declare your Seminar

officially open.
