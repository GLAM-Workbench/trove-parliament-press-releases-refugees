TRANSCRIPT OF THE HON. TONY ABBOTT MHR,  INTERVIEW WITH GARY HARDGRAVE,  RADIO 4BC, BRISBANE

Subjects: Border protection.

[Greetings omitted]

TONY ABBOTT:

We certainly had a good briefing from the officials about what they think the current situation is in respect  of people smuggling. But in the end we canÃ¢ÂÂt save the country from opposition, the Prime Minister has to  declare what her new policy on people smuggling and boat people is because since the High Court case last  week and since the Solicitor-General opinion on the weekend the Government officially has no policy. So  we need to know what the GovernmentÃ¢ÂÂs policy is and then we can respond to it but the ball is firmly and  fairly and squarely in the Prime MinisterÃ¢ÂÂs court.

GARY HARDGRAVE:

Ok, but the other day you made the offer to help her out of this mess. YouÃ¢ÂÂve had the briefing with the  officials, so is there some advance on all of this or has it just simply been a nice business class trip for  Andrew Metcalfe and his crew out of Canberra to Brisbane today?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I donÃ¢ÂÂt know how Andrew and other senior public servants got here from Canberra but, look, it was  good to talk to them and we had a very candid and a very well-informed briefing from them but in the end  itÃ¢ÂÂs the Prime Minister and the Minister who set the policy, itÃ¢ÂÂs not the officials, and what the Government  needs to say is what it proposes to do, what legislation, if any, it wants. Now, then we have a chance to  respond and the point IÃ¢ÂÂve been making Gary is that it is important that we have a border protection policy in  place. The Coalition has a clear policy on this. ItÃ¢ÂÂs Nauru, itÃ¢ÂÂs temporary protection visas and itÃ¢ÂÂs turning  boats around where that can be done safely. The Government has no policy on this and theyÃ¢ÂÂve got to tell us  what their new policy is.

Now, if they still want to bring about third country offshore processing weÃ¢ÂÂre happy to be constructive and  cooperative although I stress that we donÃ¢ÂÂt like the Malaysia deal. WeÃ¢ÂÂve never liked the Malaysia deal and  if thatÃ¢ÂÂs what the Prime Minister wants to persist with sheÃ¢ÂÂd better tell us.

Well Tony, I donÃ¢ÂÂt know how practised you are in international diplomacy, IÃ¢ÂÂve got a fair idea youÃ¢ÂÂd know a  little bit about it but the President of Nauru is at the South Pacific Forum, you know, everybodyÃ¢ÂÂs there. The  President of Nauru has been asked directly about whether Nauru is ready for this. Is he going to bump our  Prime Minister and ask her, and hereÃ¢ÂÂs what he had to say today apparently.

MARCUS STEPHEN:



It would be rude of me if I raised it with her. It’s not the right thing to do. If Australia wants  to raise it it’s up to Australia and if not then I’m not going to raise it. Put it this way, I do  understand that your executive government will know what’s best for Australia. I don’t want  to involve myself with what’s best for Australia.

GARY HARDGRAVE:

I guess heÃ¢ÂÂs just being diplomatic, saying heÃ¢ÂÂs not going to go and front Julia Gillard and say, “hey, IÃ¢ÂÂm  ready to process people in Nauru; youÃ¢ÂÂve got to raise it first.”

TONY ABBOTT:

And look, he wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt want to look like Nauru are desperate for this centre and when I was there with Scott  Morrison a few months ago the President, the Foreign Minister and other members of the Nauruan  Government made it crystal clear that if Australia would like to reopen a detention centre they would be  only too happy to help but Nauru was in good shape, they didnÃ¢ÂÂt need it, but they would certainly offer to  have one if we requested it. So I think the ball is in the Prime MinisterÃ¢ÂÂs court in this issue as well. IÃ¢ÂÂve been  saying for months, if not years, that the Prime Minister should pick up the phone to the President of Nauru.  She should, and if she wants to pick up the phone to me IÃ¢ÂÂd gladly take the call.

GARY HARDGRAVE:

I mean, theyÃ¢ÂÂre very rehearsed lines now because you have been saying it for a heck of a long time and it  just - the thing that struck me the other day Tony was when the Prime Minister said, Ã¢ÂÂoh, weÃ¢ÂÂre not going to  follow Mr AbbottÃ¢ÂÂs narrow agendaÃ¢ÂÂ, but sheÃ¢ÂÂs got a narrow agenda of her own.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well she doesnÃ¢ÂÂt have an agenda. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs the problem. I mean, if she had an agenda, fine, but the agenda that  she had has been ruled out, she said, by the High Court. Now, sheÃ¢ÂÂs got to come up with something to  replace that agenda and as I said, IÃ¢ÂÂm happy to be constructive and cooperative provided sheÃ¢ÂÂs not asking us  to support something which we think is against the national interest.

GARY HARDGRAVE:

Well, either way, it seems the ball, as you say, is in her court. ThereÃ¢ÂÂs spotlight on you but you reject the fact  youÃ¢ÂÂve got to be the one getting the Prime Minister out of this mess.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I am happy to support what I think will be effective border protection policies. I am happy to support  the Prime Minister in her attempt to restore effective offshore processing but itÃ¢ÂÂs got to be something which  is, in my judgment, consistent with the national interest and weÃ¢ÂÂve got to have border protection policies.  Unfortunately this Government has no policies. So itÃ¢ÂÂs really up to the Government to say what its new  policy is and then weÃ¢ÂÂve got something to respond to.

GARY HARDGRAVE:

Strong feedback at the Caboolture forum Wyatt Roy ran last night?

TONY ABBOTT:

Yes, yes. This is a very, very vexed question. Now, the forum as far as I was concerned was more about the  carbon tax and that was obviously a big topic last night but a lot of people also raised border protection and  there was a lot of anger at the way the Government has lost control of our borders. Again, as I keep saying,  Gary, John Howard found a problem and created a solution. Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard found a solution  and created a problem and this is why I think the public are so angry with them, because they were not big  enough to leave well enough alone here.

GARY HARDGRAVE:

Alright Tony Abbott, good to talk with you. Travel safe. Thanks for your time.

TONY ABBOTT:

Thanks Gary.
