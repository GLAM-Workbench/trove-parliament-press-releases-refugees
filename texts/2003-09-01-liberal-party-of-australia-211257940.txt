Philip Ruddock MP  MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND MULTICULTURAL AND INDIGENOUS AFFAIRS

Support from Bob Carr Welcomed

MPS 59/2003

Divisions with the Labor Party over policy on unauthorised boat arrivals were becoming clear the Minister for Immigration  and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Philip Ruddock said today.

The comments from NSW Premier Bob Carr that Australia's policy on boat arrivals had not hurt relations with countries in the  region demonstrate the problems facing federal Labor.

Labor has moved to unwind mandatory detention and walk away from border protection measures that it had earlier  supported.

In the coming months, the ALP at a federal level, will be able to demonstrate where it stands on border protection and the  integrity of Australia's planned migration programs.

A number of key issues will be addressed in the Parliament, giving the electorate a chance to assess whether Labor is serious  about border protection and enhancing Australia's ability to remove failed asylum seekers in a reasonable time.
