INTERVIEW WITH CLIVE PALMER

KATHRYN ROBINSON: Speculation is growing that the Australian Motoring  Enthusiasts is going to expel Ricky Muir some time this week. When are you going to  recruit him to the Palmer United Party?

CLIVE PALMER: We hadn't thought about that. Of course, that's just a press beat-up.  The Australian executive of the Australian Motoring Party is the only person that can  expel Mr Muir. These people themselves have been thrown out of the party and are  just a dissident group and a dissident branch, same as though as if the Coogee branch  of the Liberal Party expelled Tony Abbott. That would be a big story, wouldn't it?

KATHRYN ROBINSON: It would, but can you really say and honestly say that you  haven't thought about it? Because if you did recruit him, you would have five  members. You'd get legitimate party status, and then a whole lot more funds would  come your way. And that's what you've been badgering Tony Abbott for.

CLIVE PALMER: No, we're not in politics for funds or for money. That's not  something we want. All we've said all to Mr Abbott, and the press has beat it up, is  that we have three or four senators that have to consider the weight of legislation from  the entire House of Representatives, all the ministries, the whole Government, and if  they have to read every bill, line by line, it'll slow the process down. We're suggesting  that shouldn't happen. We're suggesting we want an orderly process, we want good  Government. We don't want a Parliament like we had last time. So please, give us  some resources so these people don't have to read all the bills themselves.

LAUREN WILSON: Mr Palmer-

CLIVE PALMER: I thought that's in Mr Abbott's interests.

LAUREN WILSON: Your deal with Ricky Muir - is it a deal with Ricky Muir or is it  a deal with the Motoring Enthusiasts Party? And don't the public have a right to see  it?



CLIVE PALMER: Well, it's a deal with the party, I guess, and also with Mr Muir.  They've both endorsed it. Um, but I don’t think the public have a right to-

PAUL BONGIORNO: So did you negotiate with - did you negotiate with Ricky Muir  himself, or did you negotiate with the federal executive up in Queensland, of the  party?

CLIVE PALMER: You know, he's a hard negotiator, that Ricky Muir. He decided  that he wanted to get more senators supporting the motorists’ policies. He badgered  our senators time and time again to support the motorists’ policies. There wasn’t  much I could do about it. He convinced them. So we thought we should all support  him.



LAUREN WILSON: What does Mr Muir get in return? Does - is he allowed to travel  on your jet? Does he get additional resources from you?

CLIVE PALMER: He doesn't get anything from me, other than the rights to be able to  - that we're all supporting his policies. I'm not even in the Senate. I may not even be in  Parliament. I'm just a normal party member trying to do my best for Australia.

PAUL BONGIORNO: Well, Dio Wang, your Senate candidate over in WA - you  tweeted this week that you thought the recount was undemocratic. How is it  undemocratic?

CLIVE PALMER: Well, I can only comment, Paul, in relation to what's happened to  me in Fairfax - that's my personal experience. I've won the first count, I won the  second count, and AEC - the senior AEC officer made a determination on all those  ballots who they should go for. Now they're doing a third count with me, they’ve sent  all the ballots to Brisbane, they’ve got a different AEC officer deciding whether the  first AEC officer was right in his determinations.

PAUL BONGIORNO: Yeah, but can we-

CLIVE PALMER: I think it should be what the people say in Australia. They’ve got  the right, not the AEC officer.

PAUL BONGIORNO: Well, coming to Western Australia. Your candidate there got  almost 5% of the primary vote, whereas the Greens' Senator got almost 10%. It's  hardly - the system itself, even though it's preferential, does look like it needs reform.  Would you support some sort of reform?

CLIVE PALMER: Of course, that's not true. When the National Party preferences -  our guy got more than 9%. It's just like the National Party across Australia - they got a  total vote of 4%. We got 5.6%.

PAUL BONGIORNO: No, I accept - yeah, I accept the preferential system, but don't  we have the micro-parties gaming the system? That's hardly transparently democratic,  is it?



CLIVE PALMER: Well it just really means that, if you've won the election, you don't  want other people to compete with, you don't want normal Australians to compete,  you can legislate to exclude them. I don't think that's democracy, to be honest with  you. You can't really complain about the system after you've lost the election. And as  I said before, we got 5% - 5.6% across Australia. The National Party got 4%, but  Warren Truss is Deputy Prime Minister. What's the justice in that?

LAUREN WILSON: If you do succeed in your bid for the seat of Fairfax, you've  claimed when you get to Parliament, you won't be claiming any entitlements. Do you  think that the system, as it currently stands, enables rorts, and would you support calls  to change it?

CLIVE PALMER: I think we should do what we do in the United States Senate - they  give every Senator a gross amount for his entitlements, and it's up to him how he  spends it. That saves the taxpayer a lot of money because it eliminates all the finance  gurus, all the investigations by the AEFP, holding up the courts with cases like the  Slipper case and things like that. They're all trivial things. They take the distraction  off what the national agenda should be - the economy and serious things which affect  people's lives. So, we don't want to deal with trivia. We don't want our media running  around about trivia. We want them to concentrate on the serious issues.

LAUREN WILSON: Tony Abbott has said this week that he believes the minor  parties will support his mandate. Will you support the mandate that the Prime  Minister claims he has?

CLIVE PALMER: Well, I don't know what a mandate is. I know what the result is,  and the Australian people have voted to give us the balance of power. It's an awesome  responsibility, and one we respect a lot. And of course, when a bill is presented to  you, we'll have to look at it. You could have a bill that says something and does  something else. So, we really can't say what our position is until we see the bill. And  to determine that position, we'll need some help and support, like they do, in drafting  the bill.

PAUL BONGIORNO: So you don't think this mandate argument has much weight?

CLIVE PALMER: Zero.

KATHRYN ROBINSON: So, can we assume that, if you've been on the record  before, but it seems somewhat that you might be backing away from it now, that you  would support the repeal of the carbon and the mining tax?

CLIVE PALMER: Well, we can't take anything for granted with us. We have to see  what's in the bill. We've said that our policy, in relation to the mining tax, was to - is  to get rid of it. In relation to the carbon tax, we've said that we want it abolished from  the day it was introduced. Because if it's a bad tax, it's always been a bad tax. And I  don't know whether that's Liberal Party policy. I don't think it is.

LAUREN WILSON: So there's no ambiguity there - you will allow for the repeal of  both taxes?

CLIVE PALMER: There's an ambiguity, because we think it should be repealed from  the date of introduction and the Liberal Party policy seems to be only to repeal it and  not worry about the injustices that happened over the last year or two. So we'd want to  get clarification on that, we’d want to get some advice, talk to people and have a  friendly discussion with Mr Abbott.

PAUL BONGIORNO: So if that doesn't happen, which by the way does look like  people who are by - in definition polluters being reimbursed for the carbon tax they've  paid, I don't think that would be very politically saleable, would it?

CLIVE PALMER: I don't know. It's really, at the end of the day, you've got to think  about the consumers, the people that have paid higher electricity prices in NSW,

Victoria and other states, and you've got to say about the future, whether that's  justifiable. You've got to ensure, if they get rid of the carbon tax, for example, that  electricity prices will come down, and it won't just be an excuse when they've brought  the prices up. That causes the carbon taxes to continue to gouge poor pensioners that  live in Australia that can't afford to pay electricity prices.

LAUREN WILSON: Do you support-

CLIVE PALMER: There's got to be some help for them.

LAUREN WILSON: Do you support Tony Abbott's direct action policy to curb  emissions?

CLIVE PALMER: Well, I don't know what it is. You read the Liberal Party policy,  and it talks in clichÃÂ©s and very general. We want to see specific details.

KATHRYN ROBINSON: What about Anthony Albanese's idea today that's been  reported in the papers of cutting the carbon tax to 0% for an immediate transfer to the  ETS. Would you support something like that, Mr Palmer?

CLIVE PALMER: I don't know. I'd have to consider it, you know? That's why we  need more support and resources. We just haven't got the resources that Mr Abbott's  got and Mr Albanese's got, yet we're expected to make decisions on things that are  most important to the Australian public. And we just need more help.

KATHRYN ROBINSON: So what would you say to people listening to this interview  right now, if you were to be asked what does the Palmer United Party stand for?

CLIVE PALMER: Well, it's pretty clear, if you go to our website - our policies are  quite there in much more detail than the Liberal Party and the Labor Party, but of  course not many journalists have gone there to read them. But we've had 7 million  hits on our website. So a lot of Australians are interested about policy, about new  ideas, and of course the last election was bereft of any policy or new ideas. There  were photo opportunities with the Prime Minister, but he didn't answer any questions.

KATHRYN ROBINSON: So what's your policy on asylum seekers, say?

CLIVE PALMER: Well, our policy on asylum seekers is to allow asylum seekers to  fly to our airports rather than pay $20,000 in a people smuggler to come in on a $400  ticket. As soon as they arrive, to have a hearing for a couple of hours to see if they can  prove they've got right of entry. And if they're not genuine refugees, to send them  back on the very next flight. And that's what happens in the United States when  people flying from Cuba to Miami. They’re given a hearing. It’s - the onus is on them  to prove whether or not they've got a legal right of entry. And if they haven't, they're  returned to their country of departure.

LAUREN WILSON: Who funds the flights over?

CLIVE PALMER: In America, they're funded by the person. And they can't board the  flight unless they've got a return ticket.



LAUREN WILSON: And what about on-

CLIVE PALMER: That saves a lot of money.

LAUREN WILSON: What about on foreign investment - the Government is wanting  to lower the threshold to trigger an inquiry by the Foreign Investment Review Board.  Would you support lowering that to $15 million?

CLIVE PALMER: Well, if you did that in the United States - the United States  citizens can invest in Australia up to $1 billion without any supervision whatsoever. I  think you've got to look at an equitable situation. You can't discriminate against  countries. But there is a strong case to say that state-owned companies are a different  category. They can come over here as state-owned companies, have a dispute with an  Australian company, and go on the courts for five or six years and they don't really  have to make a profit. There needs to be some quick way of resolving problems and  ensuring they comply with any conditions that are issued by the FIRB.

KATHRYN ROBINSON: Okay, Mr Palmer we are out of time, but thank you for  joining us today on Meet The Press.

CLIVE PALMER: A great pleasure. All the best, Paul. Keep it up.
