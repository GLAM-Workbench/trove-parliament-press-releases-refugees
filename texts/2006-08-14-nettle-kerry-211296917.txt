Kerry Nettle, Senator for New South Wales



Ashmore arrivals should not be sent to Nauru

Senator Nettle, 14th August 2006

Greens Immigration spokesperson Senator Kerry Nettle has called on the government  to listen to the community and parliament and not send the 8 asylum seekers who  have arrived on Ashmore Reef to Nauru.

"It's appalling that on the day that the Prime Minister withdrew its bill to send asylum  seekers to Nauru the Minister is proposing to do just that," Senator Nettle said.

"The last time anyone was sent to Nauru was over four years ago, given today's defeat  of the migration legislation this looks like another cynical and cruel political move.

"The Minister is deliberately keeping secret the nationality, age and sex of the new  arrivals in a blatant attempt to dehumanise them by referring to them as unlawful  arrivals instead of human beings.

"The government will regret banishing these new arrivals because community  sentiment is not with them.

"These asylum seekers should be brought to the mainland and processed fairly and  compassionately in accordance with our international obligations."
