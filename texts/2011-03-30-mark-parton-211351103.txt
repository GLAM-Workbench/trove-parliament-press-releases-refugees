2CC WITH MARK PARTON  30 MARCH 2011

E&OE

Subjects:  Paul Keating, NSW elections, Bali conference.





MARK PARTON:     And we’re about to go to Federal Trade Minister Craig    Emerson. And, in fact, we can do that now. Thanks for  waiting for us, Craig.

CRAIG EMERSON: You’re right Mark - no problem.

PARTON:                Do you wish - with all respect to the former Prime Minister  - do you wish that Paul Keating would shut the hell up?

EMERSON:             He’s entitled to his view; he’s not only a former Prime  Minister: he’s a former President, I think, of the New  South Wales Labor Party. But look, I think what it comes  down to is that over time the Labor opposition will need to  develop alternative policies because in the end that’s  what people pick on. What will political parties do for me  and do for my state; do for my country? So we can do a  lot of analysis, just about who’s who, but ultimately it’s  about policy. But I think in Sydney, in particular, they’ve  got transport - and the electricity privatisation which  ended up not having at all a happy passage through the  state Labor system would have actually funded some very  important transport links in Sydney. Anyway, it didn’t  happen and that’s one of the reasons that Barry O’Farrell  got elected, and congratulations to Barry.



PARTON:                Your leader has answered questions since Saturday  suggesting that what’s gone on in New South Wales will  have absolutely no implications federally. Paul Keating  suggested otherwise yesterday:  you know, he said that  this election loss will have federal implications and he

called John Robertson, for arguments sake, ‘more weight  for Julia Gillard to drag along’. Your thoughts?



EMERSON:             My thoughts are that what Julia was saying was  specifically in relation to a particular policy issue and  policy issues more generally. That is, the carbon tax, and  I’ve talked to a number of our federal colleagues who  were on the booths in New South Wales on Saturday -  some for five or four hours at a time - and they are saying  to me that no one mentioned the carbon tax. Now, that’s  just a fact.  Obviously Tony Abbott would like us to believe  it was a referendum on the carbon tax and there wasn’t  any problem with New South Wales state Labor  government. Well, that’s his spin: the truth is there was  either none or virtually no reference whatsoever to the  carbon tax.



PARTON:                I know that there’s discussions going on - well in fact it  went on last night - involving the Foreign Minister and the  Immigration Minister - in Bali regarding , well, a number of  things.  But one of the things I know they weren’t  discussing was this so-called East Timor solution as far  as refugee processing. It’s completely off the agenda.  Was it ever on the agenda with anyone?



EMERSON:             Well, what we’re seeking is a regional solution to a  regional problem. And, a regional processing centre  would be part of that. The Bali conference, as I  understand, is overwhelmingly about the broader issues  of people-smuggling and cooperation amongst different  countries. And, I certainly have seen even in the last few  days, Mark, references to policies never being able to see  the light of day - that they’re going to be blocked.  Remember the Queensland flood levy? That was never  going to get through the Parliament, but it did. Remember  the National Broadband Network?  It was never going to  get through the Parliament, but it did. Even yesterday, the  Mineral Resource Rent Tax was never going to get  through the Parliament. The Greens Party has indicated  that it will vote for it. And then the tax cuts for companies  and for small business were never going to get through  the Parliament and - hallelujah! - you wouldn’t believe it,  Tony Abbott said he might even think of voting for tax cuts  for small business. Well I think he should.



PARTON:                These are, these are ...



EMERSON:             The point I’m making is that time and time again we’re  told this isn’t going to happen; they’ll never be able to do

it.  And every bit of legislation that we’ve actually put up,  Mark, every bit of legislation has got through. We’ve  managed to get it through. It has actually been a stable  government. Let’s see what happens with the regional  processing centre. But what I’m saying is this conference  itself was not ...  this was never going to be the focal point  of the Bali conference.



PARTON:                Yeah, I just, I mean it’s one thing to talk about pieces of  legislation getting through Parliament here. I think it’s  quite another to talk about twisting the arms of these  people in ... in places overseas and convincing them that  they can be the solution to our problem.

EMERSON:            Well it is a regional problem. People-smuggling is not  unique to Australia, nor to the region. Have a look: we  might have a chat in about six months time as to what  happens in southern Europe as the people flood out of  North Africa and into southern Europe. Now, this is not a  problem that is not unique to Australia - of course it’s an  issue. We want to deal with the issue. There has been  some expressions of support for the concept of a regional  processing centre from a couple of countries, but it was  never to be the focal point of the Bali conference and the  broader point I’m making is that time and time again we  were told we would not be able to achieve something and  each time we’ve been able to defy the pundits and  achieve it. That’s what we are: an energetic government.  We’ll press ahead with our programme.



PARTON:                Well, thanks for your energy this morning, as always.

EMERSON:             Thanks, thanks Mark. Thanks a lot.

PARTON:                 Federal Trade Minister, Craig Emerson.
