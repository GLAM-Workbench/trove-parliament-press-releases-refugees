NINE STOWAWAYS ON GREEK VESSEL

A spokesman for the Department of Immigration and Ethnic

Affairs has confirmed that a Greek vessel which reported in

at Geelong today carried nine persons alleged to have stowed

away before the vessel the 'Dimitris LF' left Ho Chi Minh City.

There were six females aged from 19 to 27 years and three

males aged from 23 to 34 years on the bulk grain carrier.

The spokesman said it was unusual that so many people without

experience of ships could have evaded the port controls and stowed

away without the awareness of the ship's officers and crew.

He said the stowaways were legally the responsibility of

the ship's master and agents. However, as a result of interest of

the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in these people

it was believed that the Greek Government had agreed to accept them.

Further enquiries were being made and the stowaways would

remain on board or in detention as was normal practice until

arrangements could be.made for their onward movement.

The spokesman said the question of their staying in

Australia had not been considered. Australia has so far accepted

26 000 refugees from Indo China since 1975.
