Howard Must Apologise to the Navy and the Nation

The Prime Minister and senior Ministers Mr Reith and Mr Ruddock must immediately apologise following revelations that the Navy did not inform them that children were thrown overboard by asylum seekers on October 7th, Greens Senator Bob Brown said today.

“The public have been deceived, asylum seekers vilified, and the navy misrepresented by the actions of the nation’s most senior representatives,” Senator Brown said.

“It was the responsibility of Mr Howard and his ministers to check the facts with the navy.

“For the sake of all concerned there should in future be independent observers upon the naval vessels intercepting asylum seeker boats. The Government can not be trusted to provide the facts, others must now do it for them,” Senator Brown said.
