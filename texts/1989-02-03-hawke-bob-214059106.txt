PRIME MINISTER

TRANSCRIPT OF PRESS CONFERENCE ORIENTAL HOTEL BANGKOK  ' 3  FEBRUARY 1989

t ;  k OE TROOP ONLY

Ã¢ÂÂ¢JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, if I could start with a domestic political question, could you clarify for us now what you  meant in your answer yesterday in referring to ?ny possible  deferral.of the tax cuts that this wasn't in your 'thinking at

this stage?

h m :  it's a case of getting unnecessariiy knicker knotted over a phrase on your part. I have made clear consistently  that the tax cuts will come in on the first of, July, period.

JOURNALIST: Is Australia trying to convince Thailand of the necessity of building a new economic bloc j,n Asia Pacific to  fight 3.9ÃÂ±ÃÂ¯ÃÂ·ÃÂÃÂ¯Â·7ÃÂ .992 single market in Europe and if so what is  the role of Thailand? And my second question is does  Australia intend to pursue the aim of bringing the Khmer

Rouge Pol Pot into international courts?

PM: On the first, question my suggestion has been firstly in ii.v recent visit to the Republic of Korea and again in my  discussions with your Prime Minister that we ought in the  region to examine how we can increase co-operation,

particularly in the economic, social H e l d  between us because  wo are living in a world as 1 put it of paradox. The paradox  .m that there has never been more reason and ground for

optimism on the political front in the international  relations area than how. But against that there are -very  ./urious causes for concern and some degree of pessimism about  the way in which nations are behaving in their international  economic relations. And so l have said that it makes sense

for this region which is the fastest growing most dynamic  region of the world to think about the ways in which we can  increase our co-operation and ] .  suggested that a model  without being prescriptive about it could be an OECD type

organisation which is not a trading bloc. And that is not my  suggestion that that sort of model, however, could provide a  sensible and constructive and very useful mechanism whereby  the countries of this dynamic economic region would be able

to interchange information and also use their influence as a  group upon the recalcitrant members of the international  community*by which we basically mean increasing stand-offs  netween the European community and the United States, that we  uu the most significant economic region in the world could

;.ay to them "Look it's Lime you came to your senses" and that

1

wÂ© rr ' , 1 1  id try and use that .influence to ensure that the  multilateral, trade negotiations which to some extent ace  ata'11 ing could he put. onto Â» more productive l rack -  So  y ;  >  V '  1.1 s **Â» that the nnnnÂ«pr. i r or. Â© of co-opÂ© rii C tor? of the

exchange ox information for facilitating growth and  co-operation within the region.  X did soy,  end T repeat  here, it you take the most pessimistic scenario, which I  non11 take,  but which certainly had some currency at the

recent. World Economic For um at Davos.  but if you took that  most: pessimistic scenario and you saw the ontorgnncn of two  major blocs in Europe and North America t.hem anything that we  have doneÂ·Â·Â· it\. developing the ideas that l am talking about

here in terms of t h tv OK CD type model e ÃÂ¿ v I a in those  pessimistic circumstances provide the building hlonkn for the  resort that no doubt, in those circumstances we m  this region  would have to have some blocs,  So that's essentia.! ly my  position. As to your second question we haven ’  t . -'id dressed

the issue of Pol Pot in the internal- i one " I  court of justice.  Our pos i  tion however in the cohti Lbut ion that, we make tn tho  discussions in this region, which we are pleased to sae arc  gatherinq momentum tow at tfs the possibility of achieving a

sett lenient, in Cambodia,  is based upon the firm foundation  that there should be no place in the outcome for PoJ. Pot and  those c. lose ly associated with him in the barbarous atrocities

r>  ÃÂ the period when they were in power in Kampuchea.

JOURNALÃÂs t ;  Prime Minister, what specific  additionspressure put. on OECD type organisations j.n Asia  and the Pacific actually bring the grouping:Â» like the Cairns  Group ... already fighting firo?

PM: Well obviously it would have within it additional strength,  aririUu.naJ membership as in the Cairns Group now.  But that is only one aspect of what. T ,ym to iking  fib out -  Obviously the sort of body that. T put up as s  suggestion and f .  repeat not as a prescription would have

important exchange information .functions which would be of  use to every member of that group. But l find it difficult  to believe that if \w were able ÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ get a grouping of t.hooo  nations of in this region which is <Â«s we all know the fastest,  growing group, one which constÂ· i  l  utes in its collective  econonitilc activity the majority of the world’s production and  Increasing proportion of the world’s Â· :  trade,  but if i  s not  going to have an increased cl out. :ln discussions with Europe  and with the United States.  T t Â«Â«Â«ins to he logical to expect

that that would be the case.

JOURNALIST:  Could Asia form a crafting group stronger than  America and the European communition?

PM: We LI it depends on what you’re talking about.

.rosjHNAr.isT: Trading bloc.

PM: Trading bloc. Well if you look at the facts of  production and trade the region that I am talking about at  the present time provides more than half of the production.  It's larger than the other two and in terms of trade is going  to be, is already, the most important area and. will be  increasingly so. So if you just, look in aggregates and  production and trade it can be more significant. But 1 don't  want to approach those issues in terms of saying we are  bigger, stronger, got more stick than you. I mean it is that

sort of attitude which is counter-productive at the moment. We arc seeing the relationships between the United States and  Europe deteriorate into that sort of situation now and not  only the general discussions but now its degenerating more

particularly as a result of the argument they are having over  the hormones issue that. Americans are saying well we are  going Uo}in retaliation to you stopping the access^of our  meat, we are going to stop an equivalent or greater

equivalent amount of your products coming into our country.  It's this concept of who is the more powerful, who can use  the greater stick tu hit the other one which is precisely  the sort of thing that we want to avoid.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, do you have a time frame within which the Asia Pacific Croup might begin^realise .... I mean  should we wait to the end of the Uruguay Round ... talking  two years, three years.

PM: Well its artificial to put time frames on it. The sensible and intelligent way of looking at it is that we  ought to process as quickly as possible, I believe, the  consultative mechanisms, the sounding out of the countries in  the region as to how they want to see our forms of  GO-upvration increase including a consideration of the type

of model that 1 have talked about. Now on that process I  have said that I would hope that by the end of this year we  could have a ministerial type meeting on that. It is not an  issue which can be rushed because you have not only the

question of individual perspectives and perceptions but also  you have the existence of ASEAN and the members of ASEAN will  want to consider their attitude to this issue in relationship  to what their member ship of ASEAN means. So quite clearly

the processes of discussion, preparation, if there is overall  a positive response to the concept will take the best part of  this year to get towards a productive ministerial type  meeting. Now while that's going on you have got the process

under the adjourned Montreal meeting, if I can put it that  way, with the agreement that there will be a meeting in  Geneva in April. Now between now and April a lot of

discussions are going on. For my part J. have written strong  letters to President Bush and to the major political leaders  in Europe and have put a very hard Jine to them as to the  obligation which rests upon them to use this time between now  and April to produce a mere productive result. Because what  you have got to understand is that a considerable amount of  progress has been made in the Uruguay Round discussions.

4

Agreements r  the basis of agreement has been reached on e3.even  out of the fifteen heads and the four that are left with  agriculture, textiles and safeguards and intellectual  property, those four out of the fifteen ... disagreement are  holding up agreement on the eleven areas.  So there is a very  strong incentive for intelligent leadership around the world

to make use of this period bo tween now and April. Now  obviously if good sense prevails against the more pessimistic  scenario that some people have been recently projecting then

the type of pressures and thinking that would be going into  our regional perceptions would be different.  So to put a  timetable on the possible emergence of some bloc is not  really the right way to approach it. I want to see the work  done on this regional concept because whatever assumption you  make about the outcome of the NNCN Round there j.s a role and

purpose for this regional grouping. It may have for the most  pessimistic scenario another purpose but you won't;know that  until quite a way down the track.

JOURNALIST:  Prime Minister,  there’s speculation about a  potential Australian rote in sett lenient, in Kampuchea,  so  ... do you think Australia should be involved in some way or  another, and how do you see that kind of involvement, what  role, and thirdly has it arisen in any discussions you have  had with Thai leaders here?

ÃÂÃÂ: Australia should have a role on this condition. We are  qualified, we are part of the region and we have a continuing  well established interest, but we should have a role if we  are wanted.  Australia has never taken the view, and  certainly under my leadership, hasn't taken the view that  here we ate whether it be here or the Middle East or

somewhere else, our name's Australia shift over we are going  to come and fix it up - that's not our approach.  We do have  a legitimate .interest and if we are wanted then we will be  prepared and happy to play a role. You ask what sort of a

role,  well the question which precedes that is that the  participants in the discussions that are going on and the  various strands of discussion.  As you know there are many.   There's the discussions between Vietnam and China, there's

the discussions between the Soviet. Union and China,  there’s  discussions between Thailand and Laos and Cambodia and  Vietnam and there is the JIM meetings.  J .  mean you have got  to understand there's a who3,e number of streams of

discussions going on. Now out ot those discussions ii it  emerges that,  if we could term it, the major directly  involved parties want Australia in, then w e '11 be in. Now  you ask what would the role be. You can't answer that

question because the parties haven't answered the question  themselves.  There is as you know a difference of view  between whether at one extreme you would have a military  peacekeeping forco or at the other extreme a totally unarmed  body limited entirely to a monitoring process of the

electIunu. Now therefore what role Australia would have must  be an outcome of what sort of agreement is reached on the  role of what is now, in the absence of a final agreement,

5

called an international control mechanism. I mean the  concept ul a peacekeeping torch, that phrase has been put  aside and the control commission is pat aside and they have  used this general phrase, mechanism. They have got to put  content into what they want the mechanism to be and what

function there is tor it to be because before I can answer  your question,  what will Australia's role be?

JOURNALIST:  Mr Hawke,  the foreign Minister has said he doesn't think Australia should put an armed force in. Do you  agree with that view?

PM: We11 prima facie that would be the obvious Australian position.  You prefer positions where you don't have armed  personnel involved.  Now neither the Foreign Minister nor 1  would rule out if you had agreement that there was a need for  some component of that, type, we would obviously consider

that, but our preference would be for an involvement which  was not of that type.  But we are committed to playing a  positive and constructive role In the process,  we have made  that clear and in the discussions that I have had already at

this point it. seems to be very clear that there is a desire  among the participants, as far as i can see,  for an  Australian presence.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister,  ... Australian dollar ...  Senator Button says the economic fundamentals indicate that  the dollar should nut continue to rise. Is that a view that  you endorse?

PM: Well I tend on these questions to basically conduct ray discussions and express my views within the Government  framework.  I certainly intend to do that, and I certainly  don't intend to give some exposition on what's happening to

the $A from the Oriental Hotel in Bangkok.

JOURNALIST;  Senator Evans has said that he is concerned  about the plight of the Vietnamese refugees in Hong Kong. Also your hosts have a lot of Vietnamese and other refugees,   Kampuchean refugees in Thailand.  Is Australia prepared to be  more flexible in accepting refugees?

PMÃÂ¯  I don’t think the question needs to be put to Australia  about whether we need to ho more flexible. The simple  indisputable and accepted fact internationally is that on a  per capita basis Australia has done more in accepting

refugees than any other country,  including the United States.  So that1h the ... actual figure. We've done more. Our  record is outstanding.  Therefore 1 don't think we need to be  talking about doing more.  What we are doing-is conducting

sensible discussions with countries in the region,  and it has  certainly risen in my discussions here that there needs to be  a fully involved internationl conference this year.  That  will be held - we believe it looks as though it will be the  middle of the year,  probably in Geneva.  We'll be there,  it

looks as though Vietnam will be there and we want to see out

of that international conference the achievement of the  objectives which .sensibly everyone has in mind. That is, to  have to the extent that there's going to be departures from  Vietnam, that they be orderly and acceptably organised,  that

the pressures of first asylum that have been pressing so  much, particularly upon Thailand, are eased and made  acceptable.  Those are the sorts of things that need to be  worked out in such an international conference and Australia

will be prepared lo play its part in that conference.  We've  said so and we do that from a position of great strength in  terms of our record. We don’t have to talk about being more  flexible or more generous.  No-one has been as generous as we

have.

JOURNALIST: Do you think it's Lime as the Treasurer suggests  for middle class A u s U a U a n s  to give up the idea of having  homes swimming pools and Hills hoists?

PM: l think on my reading of what’s happened that the TieuMujsi has been somewhat unfairly beaten up on this issue  - not that he's a poor defenceless fellow, lie can look after  himself au you know. But just let me make this point, simply

that we live in a rapidly changing world now in which for  some people, and just put. in terms ol the interests and  preferences of. people, that tor a lot of people the concept  of having access to medium, higher density relatively inner  city housing, tor a lot of people, has a greater relative  attraction them building a long way out further away from

place of work. That’s not a question of Paul Keating's  opinion or Hub Hawke's opinion and it just is a tact ot life.  For a lot of people that is the case. IL is the case that  the attitudes of a number ot regulatory agencies, including

local governments, are rooted in a more historical '  , conventional view of what the nature ot preferences are. Now  to the extent that what the Treasurer has said is opening up  discussion about ttie desirability of looking at facilitating  more ot that type of housing which would be attractive to a

lot of Australians then that's a good thing. It looks as  though on wtiat Mr f,reiner has now announced that it's had  precisely that effect. So this is nut a question of caving

that the dream of those who do desire, who have the  preference ot a block of their own, that'.*Â·: that's  disappeared, it's just a realistic thing to acknowledge that  for a lot of people the historical aspiration of that  sepuiaLe block may not be as attractive in these days as  having access to attractive or higher density type

accommodation closer to ihe city, So that's a perfectly sane  thing to have on the table.

JOURNALIST: Mir Hawke, getting back to the Khmer Rouge. II the effective leadership ot the Khmer Rouge is rejected in  advance by Phnom Penh, how can there be a political role tor  the Khmer Rouge and ihe second part ot that question is ydur

loreign minister said that if aid were cut to the Khmer Rouge  that they would fade away and cease to be a threat. Is that  not a little bit naive and even if il look five or ten years  for the Khmer Rouge to fade away, wouldn't hundreds if not  thousands of people still die?

PM: These are precisely the questions which are being discussed now at the various levels that i talked about  before, including the discussions between the Soviet Union  and China, and China and Vietnam and the other strands that

i'ra talkinc about. It would be quite ridiculous for me or  lux anyone else to give you an unequivocal statement as to  what the impact would be in the areas that you talk about

because you can't be certain ot this. Certainly 1 can't. Hut what you can be certain of is that t.he parties directly  involved are now getting closer, much closet lowaids  accepting that there can be no outcome which will allow the  possibility of the Khmer Rouge resuming a position of

dominance. That is not something that has to be forced tor  instance upon the Chinese who have been the most, substantial  supporters and supplier of arms to the Khmer Rouge. They

accept that position. So what has got. to be worked out is  how, for those elements of thÂ© Khmer Rouge that to the  participants are acceptable as part, ot the process,  how they  are integrated info the outcome.  What snems to be accepted

is that there, can be an identification of a number,  the  number not being certain yet.,  but of a number of leaders of  the Khmer Rouge who simply are not acceptable. There is some  difference as to what that number is but you’re not in

different ball parks of argument. There will need to bn in  the discussions, in the negotiations, a way of quarantining  the unacceptable figures. That, doesn’t mean that for the  faction there cannot be seen to be a place. Now that's  precisely one of the central issues that's involved in all  the discussions that are going on and I get the impression,

if I can put. it this way, from the very generously detailed  briefing that I have been given both by the Prime Minister  and Foreign Minister Siddhi that they have optimism that this  precise issue is capable of being worked out. If it. is then

the second part, of your question is non-operat.ive. They are  not going to in other words aerree to an outcome which "leaves  open the possibility of some return to the atrocities and  bar bar it res of the past..

JOURNALIST: What role rln you see for Prince Sihanouk and do you think he'll go to the Jakarta talks?

PM: I like the phrase that was vised to me yesterday, T see it was in the press, that when the boat finally pulls out. the  Prince is usually aboard. I see that it is still the  position from all the discussions I’ve had and reports I’ve  received there is fairly common ground that Prince Sihanouk  retains a position of centrality in the perceived outcome. He was somewhat off-put, if we can put. it. that way, by the  recent reception here of the other participants in

the CGDK grouping that came to Bangkok - that, upset him a  little bit But I'm aware that, the Prime Minister of  Thailand has a long history of close personal friendships and  relationships with Prince Sihanouk. There is no lasting

damage that has been done by that episode at ail. Their  relationships are close. So f think in any way you look at  it, given the perceptions of all the major parties, Sihanouk

will continue to have a central role. There still seems to  be some possibility that he will he attending the JIM Two  meeting.

JOURNALIST: The Treasurer Mr Keating has said that. Australia  can be a spring hoard into Asia and now he's raised the idea  of a regional OECD, yet Australian investment in a number ot  countries in Asia is actually quite slight. I wonder, do you

think Australia can justifiably claim to be a member of the  regional economyi

PM: Yes indeed we can, simply by looking at. the statistics because the greater proportion of our trade and economic  relationships and a substantial proportion of our total  overseas investment is in the region by any statistical test

you apply, whether it's trade or investment, we are part of  the region. Now my concern which I ’ve been expressing since  I've become Prime Minister is that, we've got t.o do more, and  the phrase I've used is to become enmeshed in the region, and

what we have done in the period since 1983 is very very  significant..  The degree of enraeshment is remarkably greater  than it was.  It has been a vatigated performance when you  look at it country by country and here in Thailand I have  expressed a view, and I take this opportunity of saying it  again, that l don’t think the Australian business community  has been quite as aggressive in an acceptable sense of that  word and thrusting in taking advantage ot possible

opportunities herÃÂ as it may have been.  i think therefore  that the agreement that I've reached with the Prime Minister  here to set a doubling of the two-way trade between us within  the next throe years is achievable.  It may appear ambitious  but to lift it from the A$63Q million to i.3 by the end oi

1991 seems to me achievable.  Certainly if you look at the  particular projects which are available tor Australian  participation I don't think there’s any reason why we won't  achieve that objective. Importantly, the actual agreements  that we have arrived at here to process an overall economic  ooÂ·-operation agreement, the concessionsL financing'agreement,   to go on with the double tax agreement negotiations,  I think  that in regard to Thailand it means that now as a result of  ray visit and the very productive discussions I've had with

the Prime Minister that we will undoubtedly see a boost to  involvement here and that will not only be in trade but in  two-way investment.  Australia has got to really complete the

process from the rhetoric to the lact and t.he change of  latitude. As I ’ve Â«aid, for Loo long and under previous  governments the phrase was there we're part of Asia, but the  tough hard at.ti.ludinal change wasn't there. it is coming now

and I'm as certain as I am of anything that the process of  the enmeshmeiit of the Australian economy with Asia is going  to gather momentum because that is something which is  manifestly in our interests in Australia and without

overstating our capacities it is something which is certainly  in the interests of Asia.

JOURNALIST:  There was a report yesterday from Associated Press in Chiang Mai that they're expecting a record bumper  crop oi heroin out of the golden triangle this year. is that  a concern to you and will you be talking to the Thai  authorities about, how to ensure that that crop doesn’t get

through ...?

I’M :  It is a matter of concern.  wo have talked about these iuuuuu.  I've given my assurance to the Prime Minister and to  his ministers that Australia's involvement with the Office of  the Narcotic Control board here in Bangkok will be carried  on. It is a very effective concrete way in which we have been  able to assist in their program of creating a more efficient

policing body.  There is no question but that we will  continue our assistance in that form and also the  cu-operation between our police iorces: SO we have that commitment,  we've got the runs on the board in terras of

actual co-operation, both in teims of financial assistance  and in terms of inter-operability ot our police forces. All  those things v/ill continue. I must say 1 will be interested  to see when I  10 concept and progi am of trying t.o develop alternative crops  and avenues of economic activity tor the people involved in  the production of ihese crops. That's another aspect oi the  approach that can be adopted. JOURNALIST: Could you discuss Australia’s assistance to the  pioject. of building the Thai-Laos bridge that you discusssed  with Prime Minister Chatichai yesterday. PM: The Prime Minister expressed the view that it would be good iÂ£ Australia would pick up this project. It was one of  those areas ÃÂÂ£ meetings between Prime Ministers where the  other Pjime Minister, thdt is me, I also thought it would be  good. So we agreed. Now the suggestion is that it would  cost about $27 million - that’s in US terms - without a rail  and perhaps $31 million with the rail. We've accepted that  we will undertake the responsibility, the design and the  construction of the bridge. It's understood that there will  need to be further detailed analyses done of what it ,   involves. Obviously we need the agreement of Laos as well -  I can’t imagine that that will not be forthcoming. We’ll  undeilake that work and then on the understanding that the  outcome of those, studies wiil validate the order of, not  w  necessarily absolutely precisely, but the order of costings  that have been put to us, then we'll go ahead with it. It's  suggested that it's something that will be done over a five  year pviivd. As I've said, this is something that will be  intrinsically desirable in helping to increase communication  and trade between two countries that historically have had  such a lelationship that’s been characterised by conflict.  So it will be important intrinsically, and as I've said, I  think symbolically it's also important in being part of  transforming a zone of war into a zone of peace. It's  some thing that I'm very pleased that we in Australia are able  to be associated with. JOURNALIST: What is the state of your Government's relations  now with the regime in Burma and how do you see them  developingV PM: I would think it's most correctly put by saying that we .  have maintained a presence there which seeks to be informed  w  to protect Australian interests and interests of others who  wilt be associated with us. We don't see ourselves as a  major player in the events of Burma although it is the case  that we have a fairly significant, program of aid and  assistance to Burma. We’ve made it clear that we want to see  a situation in which human rights are respected and in which  there is an opportunity for free and fair election in which  the will of the people of Burma can be reflected. That's the  stance that we adopt while we accept we are not a major  player in the events there. JOURNALIST: In your speech last night you reaffirmed Australia’s stance on immigration policy. in your talks in  recent days has the question uJ" the debate in Australia over  Asian immigration ai isen and have you been able to gauge  whether there’s been any longer term damage between our  relations as a result of that debate? If PM: Tho matter bar, arisen but as you would expect,  given the  politononn of our hosts it's not an issue that they pursue.   But. in the discussions that have come out it's clear that  they welcome the unequivocal statements that I make on behalf  of the Australian Government about our commitment to  non-disc.r iminatory policies.  Just anecdotely may I say that  one ot my staff before I came here was travelling out in the  country m  Thailand here and was told in respect of certain  Thai students that they had been going to come - and I think  thor$ were four of them -  were going to be coming to  Australia. They'd heard about this debate and it changed  their decision to go to Australia and instead have gone to  North America.;  So any suggestion that there hasn't been some  understanding fairly generally through the region about the  debate in Australia is simply not the case The knowledge is  there and part of what I’m about,  why I'm here.  and I ’ve said  also in Korea,  is to reiterate the position and that is that  the past practice of the '70s and the '80s of '  ; non-discrimination, that practice is irreversible.  The white  Australia policy will,  as I ’ve put it, stay where it belongs  in the history books. JOURNALIST: You spoke before about Australian investment in  Thailand. There’s been two big attempts by Australian  companies recently to get into Thailand, both have failed  rather dismally in controversial circumstances. Did you take  this up with the Thai Government? PM: Wo did not go to tho details of tho failod bidr. but. in  the major area of telecommunications,  ministers went out. of  their way to say that there were very very extensive  investment programs and expansion programs on the drawing  board and that they look forward to successful Australian  bidding in those areas.  So I would have to say that from our  point of view despite the unfortunate fact that we were  unsuccessful in the past it does seem absolutely to he the  case that our position in regard to the future is not only  not prejudiced but that the Thai authorities are looking  forward anxiously to Australian par t .  i c i  pat. i  on in the bidding  for these further contracts.  There is some anticipation 1  think that, we’ve got a good chance of being successful. JOURNALIST: Just one quick domestic one.  What are your feelings about the West Australian election and have you  spoken to Premier Dowding in the last couple of days? PM: It vill come as no surprise to you in answer to the first part, of your question as what my feelings are.  I have  a great hope that Dowding will win because that’s not only in  the intersts of the Party in the state and federally,  but  more imporantly it'  s' overwhelmingly in the interests of the  West Australian people.  My second feeling is that it will bo  desperately close. Thirdly, have I spoken to him in the last  couple of days.  no. I am here in the region advancing the  causes of Australia and of the region and that’s fully taking  up my time. 12 JOURNALIST: At. the banquet last night, you said that  Australia is ready to play a part in any restoration of peace  in Cambodia.  I understand that, you partly answered the  question but I would be interested in what role that would  involve. Would Australia consider staffing the international  control mechanism of funding and in what way .  ..? PM: I really have answered that question. You canT  t be  specific about what role you'll pi ay until the parties  themselves have agreed on what the role of the mechanism is.  They've got to use the word mechanism now as a generic  because that is reflective of the fact that there’s still a  lot of discussion and argument as to what the role will bo.  So ÃÂª can't say what our role will be in something the role of  which itself generally hasn’t been determined.  The important  point is that we are prepared to do reasonably anything that  the parties would want us to do together with others - 1 mean  Australia is not assuming sole responsibility in t.tvesp  matters - but to do what would sensibly be requested of us.  Now that could include specialist staff who had experience or  the capacity to involve the monitoring of elections - and we  have a lot of elections in Australia.  too many, you can see  that people are preoccupied with them so T don’t see that  we ’d have any trouble in providing people who would be very  competent in supervising elections.  I could send along a few  sharp scrutineers I can tell you. So we could do that. The  processes of monitoring the withdrawalr  ensuring that the  withdrawal of the Vietnamese forces was undertaken, this is  something which again we would have a capacity with others to  do. Obviously in providing these forms of personnel it.  requires finance.  We understand that if we're going to be  part of this exercise it will involve a financial outlay as  tar as we are concerned.  But we’ve had a long standing  involvement and commitment to try and fornne a peaceful  outcome of this tragedy.  Now that we are accelerating  together towards the possibility of that resolution we ’re not  going to be parsimon ious from our point of view if we're  asked in ensuring that we make an effective contribution. ends r *  .

We've accepted that  we will undertake the responsibility, the design and the  construction of the bridge. It's understood that there will  need to be further detailed analyses done of what it ,

involves. Obviously we need the agreement of Laos as well -  I can’t imagine that that will not be forthcoming. We’ll  undeilake that work and then on the understanding that the  outcome of those, studies wiil validate the order of, not  w  necessarily absolutely precisely, but the order of costings

that have been put to us, then we'll go ahead with it. It's  suggested that it's something that will be done over a five  year pviivd. As I've said, this is something that will be  intrinsically desirable in helping to increase communication  and trade between two countries that historically have had  such a lelationship that’s been characterised by conflict.

So it will be important intrinsically, and as I've said, I  think symbolically it's also important in being part of  transforming a zone of war into a zone of peace. It's  some thing that I'm very pleased that we in Australia are able

to be associated with.

JOURNALIST: What is the state of your Government's relations  now with the regime in Burma and how do you see them  developingV

PM: I would think it's most correctly put by saying that we .  have maintained a presence there which seeks to be informed  w  to protect Australian interests and interests of others who  wilt be associated with us. We don't see ourselves as a

major player in the events of Burma although it is the case  that we have a fairly significant, program of aid and  assistance to Burma. We’ve made it clear that we want to see  a situation in which human rights are respected and in which

there is an opportunity for free and fair election in which  the will of the people of Burma can be reflected. That's the  stance that we adopt while we accept we are not a major  player in the events there.

JOURNALIST: In your speech last night you reaffirmed Australia’s stance on immigration policy. in your talks in  recent days has the question uJ" the debate in Australia over  Asian immigration ai isen and have you been able to gauge

whether there’s been any longer term damage between our  relations as a result of that debate?

If

PM: Tho matter bar, arisen but as you would expect,  given the  politononn of our hosts it's not an issue that they pursue.   But. in the discussions that have come out it's clear that  they welcome the unequivocal statements that I make on behalf  of the Australian Government about our commitment to  non-disc.r iminatory policies.  Just anecdotely may I say that

one ot my staff before I came here was travelling out in the  country m  Thailand here and was told in respect of certain  Thai students that they had been going to come - and I think  thor$ were four of them -  were going to be coming to

Australia. They'd heard about this debate and it changed  their decision to go to Australia and instead have gone to  North America.;  So any suggestion that there hasn't been some

understanding fairly generally through the region about the  debate in Australia is simply not the case The knowledge is  there and part of what I’m about,  why I'm here.  and I ’ve said  also in Korea,  is to reiterate the position and that is that

the past practice of the '70s and the '80s of '  ;

non-discrimination, that practice is irreversible.  The white  Australia policy will,  as I ’ve put it, stay where it belongs  in the history books.

JOURNALIST: You spoke before about Australian investment in  Thailand. There’s been two big attempts by Australian  companies recently to get into Thailand, both have failed

rather dismally in controversial circumstances. Did you take  this up with the Thai Government?

PM: Wo did not go to tho details of tho failod bidr. but. in  the major area of telecommunications,  ministers went out. of  their way to say that there were very very extensive  investment programs and expansion programs on the drawing

board and that they look forward to successful Australian  bidding in those areas.  So I would have to say that from our  point of view despite the unfortunate fact that we were  unsuccessful in the past it does seem absolutely to he the

case that our position in regard to the future is not only  not prejudiced but that the Thai authorities are looking  forward anxiously to Australian par t .  i c i  pat. i  on in the bidding  for these further contracts.  There is some anticipation 1

think that, we’ve got a good chance of being successful.

JOURNALIST: Just one quick domestic one.  What are your feelings about the West Australian election and have you  spoken to Premier Dowding in the last couple of days?

PM: It vill come as no surprise to you in answer to the first part, of your question as what my feelings are.  I have  a great hope that Dowding will win because that’s not only in  the intersts of the Party in the state and federally,  but  more imporantly it'  s' overwhelmingly in the interests of the

West Australian people.  My second feeling is that it will bo  desperately close. Thirdly, have I spoken to him in the last  couple of days.  no. I am here in the region advancing the

causes of Australia and of the region and that’s fully taking  up my time.

JOURNALIST: At. the banquet last night, you said that  Australia is ready to play a part in any restoration of peace  in Cambodia.  I understand that, you partly answered the  question but I would be interested in what role that would

involve. Would Australia consider staffing the international  control mechanism of funding and in what way .  ..?

PM: I really have answered that question. You canT  t be  specific about what role you'll pi ay until the parties  themselves have agreed on what the role of the mechanism is.  They've got to use the word mechanism now as a generic  because that is reflective of the fact that there’s still a

lot of discussion and argument as to what the role will bo.  So ÃÂª can't say what our role will be in something the role of  which itself generally hasn’t been determined.  The important  point is that we are prepared to do reasonably anything that

the parties would want us to do together with others - 1 mean  Australia is not assuming sole responsibility in t.tvesp  matters - but to do what would sensibly be requested of us.  Now that could include specialist staff who had experience or

the capacity to involve the monitoring of elections - and we  have a lot of elections in Australia.  too many, you can see  that people are preoccupied with them so T don’t see that  we ’d have any trouble in providing people who would be very

competent in supervising elections.  I could send along a few  sharp scrutineers I can tell you. So we could do that. The  processes of monitoring the withdrawalr  ensuring that the

withdrawal of the Vietnamese forces was undertaken, this is  something which again we would have a capacity with others to  do. Obviously in providing these forms of personnel it.  requires finance.  We understand that if we're going to be

part of this exercise it will involve a financial outlay as  tar as we are concerned.  But we’ve had a long standing  involvement and commitment to try and fornne a peaceful  outcome of this tragedy.  Now that we are accelerating  together towards the possibility of that resolution we ’re not

going to be parsimon ious from our point of view if we're  asked in ensuring that we make an effective contribution.
