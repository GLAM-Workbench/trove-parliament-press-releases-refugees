CANBERRA

STATEMENT BY THE MINISTER FOR NORTHERN. AUSTRALIA, DR.. REX PATTERSON Ã¢ÂÂ  '  .

The Minister for Northern Australia, Dr. Rex Patterson, said today that

senior Civil Servants whose fundamental job is to advise Ministers on,policy

issues should never be placed in the position of having their advice, which :

may be quite contrary to the views of their minister or even the !

Government of the day, publicly examined. .

Dr. Patterson, who was a senior Civil Servant before entering- politics,

said the present action of the Senate in attempting to cross-examine ;

senior public servants could smash the efficiency of the Public Service

throughout Australia. No longer would senior public servants be free to

put on paper their personal judgements on proposed or actual

Government decisions.  .  1

Dr. Patterson reminded the Liberal-Country Party dominated Senate of; '

Sir Robert'Menzies'  rigorous view that public servants dealing with

policy issues should always be in a position to give the best possible,

and unbiased advice to Ministers. In fact, in 1965, Dr. Patterson had

been removed by Sir Robert Menzies from his senior policy position after

Dr. Patterson had publicly informed the Menzies Government that he would

stand for the Labor Party in the next Federal Election. Sir Robert

Menzies took the view that no longer would Dr. Patterson be in a position

to give unbiased policy advice to his Government. >

Dr. Patterson said that senior Civil Servants often give advice which is

quite contrary to the decision finally taken by the Cabinet. Often

Civil Servants are proved to be right by subsequent events. The reverse

also applies. .

The Minister said that when he was a senior civil servant he not

infrequently found himself in the position of preparing Cabinet

Submissions for Ministers in the Menzies Government which were contrary

to economic justification, contrary to his own judgement.and, in his

opinion, contrary to the National interest. Ministers however, always.

respected these confidential views, and the position of Public Se.ryantp as

they were an unbiased factual analysis. '  ;

I

But, said Dr. Patterson, Government policy must always over-,ride the jyiews

put forward by Civil Servants, Ã¢ÂÂ   .  ’

Dr. Patterson said he could quote cases where he and other senior Civil . .

Servants had argued with their Ministers against Federal finance for j  partÂ­

icular projects, based on fact and analysis, but the Government of the day

in its wisdom made a political decision even though it did not represent th

best allocation of taxpayers money. This however, is the. undisputed^

right of Government. /  .  .  ' .  i

The Minister said also that the stated views of senior Civil Servants

frequently have to deal with personalities in private enterprise in [other

departments and even Ministers. No Civil Servant would feel free td

express his confidential opinion if he thought at some future date he would i

be called before the Bar of the Parliament on such issues.' I

Dr. Patterson said it was clear that many Senators in the Liberal-Country

Party who had been making public statements in recent days had not the

faintest idea of how senior Civil Servants, concerned with high policy

issues, operate in the Australian Public Service. He had no objection .

whatsoever to any Public Servant, senior or junior, giving evidence' on

purely technical matters.  He himself had frequently given evidence

before such Parliamentary bodies as the Parliamentary Works Committee, but I '

all this evidence was technical. At no stage were policy issues involving

the views of Civil Servants, Ministers or the Government canvassed.;

Dr. Patterson said the fundamental role of Civil Servants is- to giye the

Government the best possible factual advice, irrespective of whether such

advice opposed the personal views of his Minister or even the policy of

his Government. It would be a disastrous and dangerous situation if

Senior Civil Servants were ever forced to provide deliberately biased

advice which had to agree with the personal whims of Ministers, the  . I

Government or even what the public itself popularly wanted. |

The Minister said it must always be the responsibility of Governments to

make “the':, final decision and therefore it is the Government which must

stand or fall on the decision it makes. It should never be the

responsibility of the Public Service to justify decisions taken by

Governments or Ministers, providing of course,  civil servants are

always placed in a position of giving unbiased advice to the best of their

ability. .  '  .  . Â· Ã¢ÂÂ  Ã¢ÂÂ  Ã¢ÂÂ  . '
