Interview with Luke Grant, MTR  Melbourne  Subjects: Trade mission to China, carbon pricing, asylum seekers.

Transcript, E&OE

10 August 2011

LUKE GRANT: Now, as you'd know, we normally on a Tuesday night speak to Brendan  O'Connor, the Minister for Home Affairs. But he's on leave this week, so in his place we've  found the Parliamentary Secretary for Pacific Island Affairs and the Member for Corio at  Geelong, Richard Marles, and I'm delighted to say he's on the line from China.

Evening Richard.

RICHARD MARLES: Good evening Luke, how are you?

LUKE GRANT: Very well, mate. Really appreciate your time. Tell us all where you are.

RICHARD MARLES: I'm in Chongqing, in central China. This was the capital of China  during the Second World War. We're here on a trade mission, which I've been doing with the  Trade Minister, Craig Emerson, to try and extend the outlook of Australian business beyond  Beijing and Shanghai to some of the big cities of central and western China. So, this is just a  small village of about 30 million people…

LUKE GRANT: [Laughs]

RICHARD MARLES: … here in central China. It is amazing the development that you see  here. I think it's been a really fantastic trade mission and lots of business will come out of it.

LUKE GRANT: Give us a sense of how well recognised Australia is in a place like that.  How are we thought of, what's been your experience there and do people understand that we  have this great mineral wealth, et cetera, that we can help them out?

RICHARD MARLES: I think people get that we've got a mineral wealth, there's no doubt  about that. A part of this mission, though, is to try and extend that, and say we've got some  really significant expertise in, you know, professional services…

LUKE GRANT: Gotcha…

RICHARD MARLES: … architecture, law…

LUKE GRANT: Yeah.

RICHARD MARLES: … environmental services. It's really trying to extend it there. I  would say that, here in Chongqing, you don't see a lot of Australians. Although Marin Burela,  who was CEO of Ford Australia and is now bascially running Ford in China, has his base  here, and Marin is a very big Cats fan…

LUKE GRANT: [Laughs]

RICHARD MARLES: … and so I had the remarkable experience last night of having a long  conversation about Bomber Thompson and Chris Scott…

LUKE GRANT: [Laughs]

RICHARD MARLES: … and all things Geelong at midnight in the InterContinental Hotel  in Chongqing.

[Laughter]

LUKE GRANT: I bet that was the only conversation involving the Geelong Cats in that city,  probably in that country.

RICHARD MARLES: Well maybe. The Cats are extending their footprint, but we were  [indistinct]…

LUKE GRANT: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

RICHARD MARLES: Oh no, we are, brother, and we were thinking about ways…

LUKE GRANT: [Laughs]

RICHARD MARLES: … in which we can get the Cats to Chongqing. So, we need to  introduce that important part of Australian culture to this part of the world.

LUKE GRANT: Very good. I saw some numbers on the weekend and, I guess, in light of  where the world economy is now, the numbers were something like - and you would  probably know better than me, but in terms of America, they're five per cent of our trade and  I think China's closer to 20 now or thereabouts. How much - that seems a huge figure. How  dangerous is it to be so reliant on the support of one country and can we get it above 20 per  cent? Can this thing continue to grow for us?

RICHARD MARLES: Well, I think it's important in terms of hedging our bets, if you like,  that we diversify our trade here.

LUKE GRANT: Yeah.

RICHARD MARLES: This is a huge population. And one of the things that really comes  through in this trip is that seeing, on the map, just one country kind of masks exactly how big  this place is.

A lot of these provinces, if they were countries in their own right, would be members of the  G20. So it's important that we're engaging beyond the east coast of China and diversifying  into the broader population out here in central and western China. And diversifying beyond  the provision of resources.

The resources boom has been a great thing for our country, but we do need to see our  economic relationship with a place like China go beyond that.

You then see the benefits of that economic relationship extend, not just to the west coast of  Australia, but to the east coast of Australia as well.

Many of the 100-strong business delegation on this trip have businesses from Brisbane,  Sydney and Melbourne. A lot from Melbourne. Even some from Geelong, actually…

LUKE GRANT: Right.

RICHARD MARLES: … and they were talking about the Cats as well.

So, there are tremendous opportunities for Melbourne, for our state, in having a relationship  with this country.

And the truth is, as China grows to become the biggest economy in the world, which we will  see in our lifetime, it is very natural that it should be our largest trading partner which today it  is.

LUKE GRANT: And what does the Chinese media and what do people within the country  think of what's going on, in particular, in the world's economy? It seems to me, from a  distance, that China is somewhat immune from all of that. Tell me about it.

RICHARD MARLES: Part of it is because the domestic market here is so huge. It really is  hard to grab hold of the dimensions of that.

The evolution of this market from a developing economy into a developed one really does  provide economic activity in this place for decades to come. So, whilst we've been seeing  uncertainty in global markets, as I'm driving along the streets of Chongqing now, what I see

across the skyline are lots of cranes, evidence of an awful lot of activity.

As I've spoken to people, including Marin, you see that is replicated, not just in construction,  but in auto manufacturing, in computer manufacturing here in Chongqing. And most of that is  actually to supply the domestic market.

So, there is an awful lot of economic activity happening here, and that's why we've got to be a  part of it.

LUKE GRANT: And I think they had some figures out today that showed inflation might  have been up a little and I just wonder what your take is on the Chinese market. Is it one that  will continue, in the near term anyway, to provide us with the - you know, the great trade  wealth we're able to get, or is it a country that's going to tighten their belt? What's your gut  feel about what the future is for them domestically?

RICHARD MARLES: That's a good question. The answer is that here in central and  western China, you're going to see bigger growth than in the big cities of the east coast of  Shanghai and Beijing.

What the Chinese do is they have a five-year plan which is, almost, their government cycle  and describes what their objectives are.

They've just announced their twelfth five-year plan.

In that, they are very focussed on the issue of the pace of growth.

There is a sense in China of wanting to make sure that the focus is on the quality of growth  rather than the growth at all costs and that will see a slight slowing down in the Chinese  economy.

LUKE GRANT: Mmm.

RICHARD MARLES: But I think that's a sensible thing for them to do.

What it will mean is that, over the long term, it's a much more sustainable picture here.

But you look at the growth in the cities, you look at the incredible growing of wealth for  individuals, particularly here in central and western China, and you can see that there is  growth in this country for decades to come and it will be a large part of the Australian story,  as a result.

LUKE GRANT: Yeah.

All right, back onto domestic issues, and the Opposition's been running this week a line that  introducing a carbon tax, particularly now with the world economic outlook a little grim, or at  least uncertain, is not a wise play. What do you say in response?

RICHARD MARLES: The Opposition have been consistently running a pretty low-rent  scare campaign, to be honest, from day one in relation to putting a price on carbon.

We have seen claims from them that this is going to give rise to increases in the cost of living  which are unimaginable which, of course, is silly.

We know what the carbon price will do and the modelling is showing - for most households -  it will give rise to something like an increase of $10 a week. And for two-thirds of

households, the compensation package that comes in as part of the carbon price, will  compensate all of that. Indeed, it will more than compensate that.

LUKE GRANT: Mmm.

RICHARD MARLES: That, I think, puts the carbon price into context. What's important  here is to understand that this is really a long-term play on the part of our country.

This is about positioning our economy, so that it is one which is globally competitive in a  world which sees that carbon intensive production is something that carries with it a penalty.

Now ,that's not a decision that you make about this week, or about the next month, that's a  decision that we're making about the direction of the Australian economy through the first  half of this century.

So whether or not there happens to be some market instability at this moment, I don't think is  really the critical issue. In terms of putting this in place, and we're very strong in our resolve  to put this price on carbon in place.

It really sets our economy in the right direction, in terms of decoupling the growth of our  economy from a corresponding growth in emissions.

But we're doing it in a way which people will be able to cope with, and I think cope with  pretty comfortably. It is the right way, notwithstanding what's going on in the markets at the  moment.

LUKE GRANT: Warren Truss said today in Melbourne that we will have the highest price  on carbon, if you will, in the entire world. Is that statement accurate?

RICHARD MARLES: I don't think that's right. What that fails to see is the movement that's  occurring elsewhere in the world to place a price on carbon. None more so than here in  China.

This is a place which is looking at introducing a number of pilot Emission Trading Schemes  in provinces which are far bigger than Australia, and doing that soon. They're taking up  renewable energy projects at an extraordinary rate.

You can see in their 12th five year plan that there is a real focus on energy use which is  sustainable, and increasing the focus on renewable energy, with targets associated with that.

The point is if China walks down that road, the rest of the world will follow it.

If that is going to happen, then Australia simply can't afford to be left behind.

The constituency I represent, which of course is in the great city of Geelong, is a constituency  which does have a high degree of carbon intensity.

It's so important for a place like Geelong, that we put our economy on a path so that industry  in Geelong, and therefore jobs in Geelong, are globally competitive for decades to come.

What you see from the Opposition is that this is a question which is all too hard, and they  have basically plunged their head into the sand and, in the process, run a scare campaign.

But they're doing nothing to solve the real issue about how we maintain a competitive  economy in the future, which we're going to have to do, because the rest of the world is  moving on pricing carbon.

LUKE GRANT: Well then they make the point, or at least Tony Abbott did a week or two  back, that whilst we're trying to reduce emissions by five per cent, China at the same time  will be increasing by 500 per cent, and I guess for the average Australian, and clearly, I mean  you'd be aware of the polls, it doesn't look as bright as it once did for the ALP.

But if you've got the general Australian thinking, we're reducing ours by five per cent,  China's upping theirs by 500 per cent, it seems like we're doing all the lifting here.

RICHARD MARLES: Well I don't think that is comparing apples with apples.

If you're looking at China, sure there is an incredible growth in their GDP which forms part  of the story here.

But if you actually measure their carbon emission intensity as a factor of their growth in  GDP, they're reducing it. To put that more simply, the carbon intensity of the Chines  economy will be reduced, just as we're seeking to reduce the carbon intensity of our own  economy.

No-one should be fooled by what the Opposition is saying here.

The fact of the matter is, whether we like it or not, China is moving, and that is going to  dictate the way the rest of the world goes in relation to renewable energy, and putting a price  on carbon.

We simply can't be left behind.

The Opposition may not want to come to terms with the global realities of this issue, but we  are facing this issue.

As I say, representing a place like Geelong, I think there is no option for someone like me but  to take on the responsibility of really making sure that we have an economy which is globally  competitive, and that means we've just got to reduce our dependency on carbon.

LUKE GRANT: Alright, now on your way back to Geelong, I'm assuming you'll be  stopping off at Malaysia, and bringing back some Burmese with you, will you?

RICHARD MARLES: [Laughs] Look, we - I…

LUKE GRANT: Unfortunate, isn't it, that High Court action has really derailed - and I've  said to Brendan O'Connor, who speaks to me regularly, I actually think this whole idea of the  Malaysian solution, if you want to call it that, is a pretty good idea, I quite like it, I think it  could well work, but you didn't need what happened the other day in the High Court, did  you?

RICHARD MARLES: Well let's see how it all pans out in terms of the interim injunction in  the High Court. There's more legal water to go under the bridge.

But, if you look at Malaysian solution, this is a sensible way forward, which does undermine  the model of people smugglers.

If you're a people smuggler, are you going to put people on a boat and send them to Australia  when what will then happen is they are returned in effect to the back of the queue in  Malaysia?

At the same time, we're doing the humane thing, and increasing our refugee intake.

I think it's a balanced solution, which will have a big impact on reducing people smuggling.

We always expected that there would be significant opposition to this. This is a controversial  proposition to put in play.

But the fact of the matter is, it's been an incredibly difficult debate for our country for a  decade. I think it is innovative thinking like this, which is going to see a solution to it.

LUKE GRANT: Well, difficult for the country, and difficult for the party, because you've  got people like Doug Cameron and others, who, you know, have been quite opposed to any  idea that puts people into another country and stops them from being processed here,  particularly these kids in this latest arrival, I mean how do you balance the interests of the  individual, like people like Doug Cameron and Melissa Parke, with the interests of the

Government and the party?

RICHARD MARLES: It's actually the interests of the refugees of the world, which is what  we are focused on.

Four thousand more refugees will come to Australia as a result of this arrangement. They will  be able to lead their lives here, compared to the circumstances that they faced in their home  country.

These are refugees who won't have to pay a people smuggler. The UNHCR will determine  who are the most appropriate for Australia to take, and that's an ordered and sensible way to  go.

People smuggling doesn't help refugees. People smuggling puts people in dangerous  positions, where they're in leaky boats, and their lives are placed at peril, as we saw tragically  at the end of last year.

I don't think any compassionate person would want to see that occur.

This is a solution that will stop that occurring and, at the same time, give 4000 more people  the opportunity of building a life in our country. Now, that is a balanced way forward.

And just going back to the High Court, we always imagined there were going to be  challenges in the High Court. That there is an interim injunction is not a particular surprise.

This is something we're going to have to work through, but we're very confident of the legal  position we've got. I think in due course we'll find that this all works.

LUKE GRANT: Yes, Richard, you dropped the compassionate word, and I've got to ask, is  it compassionate to send a nine-year-old unaccompanied boat person to Malaysia?

RICHARD MARLES: Let's see how all of these circumstances actually operate. You can  imagine that the scheme that we have put in place will be tested by people smugglers, and it  is important that we have a firm stance in relation to them.

But let's see how it actually plays out, in terms of the way in which it's implemented.

LUKE GRANT: Alright, good to talk to you, thank you very much for your time, all the way  from China, safe travels, and no doubt you'll be back to watch the Cats win the grand final,  will you?

RICHARD MARLES: Looking forward to that, I don't want to get too cocky, but I think  we're looking good…

LUKE GRANT: Oh, here we go [laughs].

RICHARD MARLES: We're looking good, well, I think it's the first Saturday in October  now…

LUKE GRANT: I think you're right.

RICHARD MARLES: …but I've got to say, it doesn't matter where you go, you run into  Collingwood supporters, and the number of Collingwood supporters I've run into in China, is  truly disturbing.

LUKE GRANT: [Laughs] Thank you very much for your time, mate, safe travelling.

RICHARD MARLES: Thanks, Luke, see you later.

LUKE GRANT: Richard Marles there, Parliamentary Secretary for Pacific Island Affairs,  and Member for Corio, in China.
