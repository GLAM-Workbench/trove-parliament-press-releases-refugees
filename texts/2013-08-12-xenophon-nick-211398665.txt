‘Vote people’ ads must stop

GOVERNMENT  STILL ‘AD’ IT   Independent Senator for South Australia, Nick Xenophon, has made a fresh complaint to the Commonwealth Auditor-General over the Government continuing to run asylum seeker ads in local media during the ‘caretaker convention’.  A copy of the complaint is attached.  On July 27 this year Senator Xenophon wrote to the Auditor General with his initial complaint and received a comprehensive response.  “The  Auditor-General  in  his  previous  response  to  me  raised  a  number  of  serious  concerns  regarding the use of tax-payers’ funds for this campaign, which could cost up to $30million,” Nick said.  These include: Ã¢ÂÂ¢ the campaign has been exempted from scrutiny by the Independent Communications Committee  on  the  basis  of  a  being  declared  a  matter  of  “extreme urgency”  by  the  Special Minister of State Ã¢ÂÂ¢ in lieu of ICC scrutiny, an “internal Statement of Compliance” dated 19 July 2013 has been prepared  by  the  Secretary  of  the  Department  of Immigration  and  Citizenship, however the internal statement of compliance has not been made public Ã¢ÂÂ¢ there  is  a  “tendency  for  campaign  media  expenditure  to  increase  in  the  lead-up  to federal elections”  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ “it  has  been  challenging  for  governments  to  exercise  to  restraint  in  spending  on advertising campaigns in the lead-up to elections”  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ “the  compressed  timeframe  has  meant  that  there  has  been  no  time  for  formal  and specific research” on the campaign, which “will inevitably raise reasonable questions as to the targeting, scale and cost-effectiveness of the campaign”   “It is just extraordinary that these ads are continuing despite an election being called,” Nick said. “It appears to be a breach of the caretaker convention.”  Senator Xenophon challenged both parties to support legislation he will introduce to tighten up on taxpayer-funded ads to ensure they are not party-political in nature.
