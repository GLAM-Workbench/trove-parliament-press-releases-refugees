E&OE……………………….………………………………………………………… ………

JON FAINE:

Mr Abbott, good morning.

TONY ABBOTT:

G’day Jon.

JON FAINE:

This could be either a very cunning strategy by the Labor Party to sucker you into a  position that they’ll use in the election campaign or an abandonment of everything  that the Rudd Government stands for. I won’t hold my breath wondering which one of  the two it is from your point of view, but we need to ask the Liberal Party what its  alternative position would be and its policies will be now that an emissions trading  scheme isn’t going ahead.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, we’ve got a policy on the table that we’re sticking with and that’s an emissions  reduction fund where we will go to the market and say give us your best offers to  improve the environment in ways that will reduce emissions, and that was the policy  that we announced in February. That’s the policy that we continue to support and  unlike Mr Rudd you know where you stand with us. But with Mr Rudd you can’t take  anything he says seriously now. As Paul Kelly suggested in The Australian this is the  biggest policy backflip in at least 50 years. Jon, this is the bloke who said that it  would be absolute political cowardice, absolute lack of leadership, absolute lack of  logic not to have action here, and now he’s opted for inaction. So how can you take

this bloke seriously, how can you think that we’ve got a Prime Minister who’s fair  dinkum about anything given what he’s just done on what was supposedly “the  greatest moral challenge of our time” even a couple of days ago?

JON FAINE:

This is what Kevin Rudd told us as we went towards an election about emissions  trading:

KEVIN RUDD:

On climate change, we confront the great moral, economic and environmental  challenge of our generation... The greatest moral and economic challenge we will  face in the 21st Century is climate change… To delay any longer would be reckless  and irresponsible for economy and for our environment.

JON FAINE:

That’s what we were told as we went towards an election but then yesterday this is  what Kevin Rudd had to say instead.

KEVIN RUDD:

It’s very plain that the correct course of action is to extend the implementation date  and to assess the action by other states at the end of 2012.

JON FAINE:

Kevin Rudd says it’s your fault, Tony Abbott, you’ve made it impossible for him to  keep his promise to the electorate.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, no, he has gutlessed out of continuing with what he said he believes in. I mean,  in 2008, in December 2008 he said the incontestable truth of climate change is that a  decision not to act is in fact an active decision to place the next generation at grave  risk.

JON FAINE:

And he says you’ve done that by making it impossible in the Senate.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I mean, he has options should he wish to exercise them and he’s gutlessed out  of doing that. Now…

JON FAINE:

But if you invoke his words in all sincerity and say that he in fact is right, then the  obligation is back on you to cooperate.

TONY ABBOTT:

But this is a challenge that he has set for himself. This is a standard that he has set for  himself and he has to be judged by the standards that he sets for himself. Now, he said  that not to act would be absolute political cowardice, absolute lack of leadership,  absolute lack of logic and he has chosen not to act. Now, this calls into question  whether this Prime Minister has any convictions on anything, convictions that he’s  prepared to fight for on anything.

JON FAINE:

It’s quite correct, though, to say that the international situation has changed. He’s not  wrong on that. He’s not wrong when he says that the situation in the Senate makes is  impossible for him to deliver and if he’s clearing the decks, preparing for a double  dissolution election, which is a quite plausible explanation, it could be that you end up

on the back foot whereas in the short term you’re on the front foot, but on the longer  term…

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, let him say that he is going to fight for what he believes in and he’s prepared to  take it to an election. I mean, if he wants the next election to be a referendum on his  great big new tax on everything, fine. But look, Jon, this is not just the emissions  trading scheme, this is the Prime Minister’s character which is at issue here, it’s the  Prime Minister’s competence which is at issue here. I mean, this is just the latest in a  series of backflips, a series of broken promises, a series of examples of a guy who just  isn’t competent and you’ve got to have a Prime Minister of competence and integrity  if you’re going to get good government.

JON FAINE:

[inaudible] this is a Prime Minister who’s concentrated on delivering a historic  healthcare deal between the Commonwealth and the states, you can’t deny him that?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well even that, Jon, is not what he said it was going to be. I mean, he told us just a  couple of weeks before he did the deal that it was going to be nationally funded and  locally run and yet the so-called national funding has got to go through at least three

levels of bureaucracy, a national, a state and a regional bureaucracy and it’ll only be  locally run, the hospitals, if the states allow it to be locally run, so even there it looks  more like a deal for politicians, not a deal for patients.

JON FAINE:

If you look at, for instance, the decision not to proceed with the human rights act, the  cutbacks on childcare, the home insulation investigation, the asylum seeker changes,

the audit of the school building programme, the changes to the foreign investment  rules on people buying houses, together with the emissions trading scheme, we’re  seeing here a decisive move by Kevin Rudd to steal the middle ground, to appeal to  your base and to go to an election with a budget that in fact now will be in much  better shape than it would have been if some of those policies were maintained.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I’m not sure about that, Jon. I think it’s been a decisive move to be indecisive. I  mean, what did Winston Churchill once say, resolved to be irresolute, decided to be  undecided, all-powerful to be impotent?  I mean, this is the kind of thing that we’re  getting from this Government. All of these changes that he’s made are basically  changes that he’s had to make to fix up failures and incompetences of his own

Government.

JON FAINE:

That poll-driven decision making, much like the Howard Government - you do your  polling, you find out what’s popular, what’s not popular and you cut your cloth  accordingly.

TONY ABBOTT:

But you’ve got to have beliefs, Jon, you’ve got to have convictions, you’ve got to  have things that you’re prepared to fight for and that’s the absence that people are  starting to notice with the Rudd Government. I mean John Howard didn’t consult the  polls about industrial reform, waterfront reform or tax reform. He didn’t the consult  the polls about Iraq and Afghanistan. He did what he believed was right in Australia’s

national interest and he was prepared to risk defeat, risk unpopularity in a good cause  and we’ve got a Government here which is addicted to safety, which is addicted to  avoiding hard decisions. I mean, this is a risk-averse, decision-shy Government. The  only decisions they can make are decisions to take the soft option.

JON FAINE:

Julia Gillard, the Deputy Prime Minister, was my guest at this time yesterday  morning. I asked her about trust and I asked her about guarantees and promises being  broken. This was what she had to say in reply.

JULIA GILLARD:

The author of the rock solid, iron clad guarantee in Australian politics was Tony  Abbott about the Medicare safety net, rock solid, iron clad guarantee in the run-up to  the 2004 election that nothing would be changed about the safety net and then at the  first budget afterwards it was cut back. So if we want to talk about questions of trust  and use of terminology like iron clad and rock solid guarantee that’s a Tony  Abbottism.

JON FAINE:

And that was Julia Gillard I think giving us a little taste of what’s to come in the  election campaign as they target you, Tony Abbott, on the same issue.

TONY ABBOTT:

Yeah, and look Jon, I’m the first to admit that that was about the most miserable  moment in my political life thus far and on that issue I was overruled by my  colleagues. It’s as simple as that.

JON FAINE:

So, what you’re conceding in fact is you’re vulnerable on the point that they’ve  targeted.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, on that one specific instance I concede that I made a commitment pre-election  and because of the circumstances changed after the election I was overruled back in  2005 I think it was.

JON FAINE:

So if you make trust an issue in this election you’ve just had a taste of what’s coming  your way.

TONY ABBOTT:

I accept that, but I think if people look at my record in politics, if they look at Kevin  Rudd’s record in Government, I’m very happy to accept the judgment of the  Australian people. I mean this, as Paul Kelly suggests, is the most spectacular backflip  in 50 years and it’s because the Prime Minister will not face up to an election which is  a referendum on his great big new tax on everything. I don’t believe he changed his

mind, he just changed his tactics. He still wants one and if you re-elect him there will  be an emissions trading scheme, but he’s not prepared to fight for it and that is a  pretty telling commentary on the political character of the Prime Minister.

JON FAINE:

Are we seeing a clearing of the decks, are you expecting an earlier election rather than  the September/October projections that were current until now?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, he said that there would be an election in the second half of the year so I  suppose he could be bringing it forward to July or August but the fact…

JON FAINE:

Are you ready?

TONY ABBOTT:

We’re ready whenever it happens, but the point I make is that in clearing the decks, if  that is what he’s doing, he has revealed the true character of the Government, he’s  revealed his own true political character and that is that you can’t take anything this  guy says seriously.

JON FAINE:

Thank you for your time this morning.
