TONY ABBOTT:

It’s good to be here at Parliament House again on the eve of the Budget to launch this significant book, Our  Little Book of Big Labor Waste, because what we have seen consistently from the current government is a  lack of respect for taxpayers' money.

I want to make two fundamental points before throwing to Jamie Briggs and then to Joe Hockey. The first  point I want to make is that government doesn't create wealth, business creates wealth, and every time  government takes money off business and consumers, that's less money that business and consumers can  spend on their priorities. The second point I want to make is that every single dollar that government spend,  it takes from you, the taxpayer. The money that government spends this year is this year's taxes or this year's  borrowings and this year's borrowings are next year's taxes. What we have seen consistently from this  government is a lack of respect for the money that it holds on trust from taxpayers.

This booklet is full of emblematic examples of this government showing inadequate respect for the  taxpayers of Australia. Because the money the government spends comes from you the taxpayers,  government should only spend it on the kind of things that taxpayers would be happy to spend their own  money on. Government should exercise the same degree of care, of frugality and prudence that you, the  taxpayer, would exercise if you were spending your own money on something that mattered to you. So, the  sixty examples of profligacy in this book exemplify the kind of mismanagement that this government has  been responsible for over the last five years and they typify why the Australian public have come to the  conclusion that this is a government which is simply incompetent and untrustworthy.

I want to thank Jamie Briggs as our Waste Watch spokesman. I want to thank the work of the Waste Watch  Committee for their help in putting this booklet together. It will be available as an e-book shortly and I  would invite anyone in the community who would like to know what is happening to their money under the  Labor Party to go to the Liberal Party website, download it and have a good look at it. But, again, I just want

2



to thank Jamie. He's done a terrific job in this particular position. He's also doing an excellent job as the  Shadow Parliamentary Secretary for Families and I ask you now, Jamie, to speak to the book.

JAMIE BRIGGS:

Thanks mate. Thank you everyone for being here today. This is a snapshot of the worst examples of the  worst government in our history and the way that they have disrespected taxpayers' money. There are big  examples like the blowout in relation to asylum seekers and there are small examples like the gold-plated  coffee machines that we see in government departments.

It's not just me who has put this together. Obviously, this has been the work of the Shadow Ministry and I  congratulate them for all their hard work whether it be in estimates, or through FOIs, or through questions  on notice or what have you, but sadly there is so much waste in here, there is so much disrespect for  taxpayers' money, this is so much part of the story of a government that blames everyone else for their  failures but never takes responsibility for their own mistakes and tomorrow we'll see more excuses but we  won't see an apology to the Australian taxpayer for wasting billions of dollars and building up debt for our  next generation to deal with.

TONY ABBOTT:

And, of course, it's very appropriate that on Budget eve we launch this book and Joe, I might turn to you for  some observations about the latest developments in respect of the Budget.

JOE HOCKEY:

Well, thanks very much, Tony. Tomorrow night, Australia is demanding honesty from Wayne Swan. We are  demanding honesty from Wayne Swan. The Budget must tell the truth about the state of the nation's books -  anything less it totally unacceptable - and if you look carefully at everything the Government has said in the  last few Budgets and in their Budget speeches, they have not been honest with the Australian people.

We demand that the Government show a plan to fix the holes in the budget - $17 billion in general revenue  this year but they keep attributing further so-called write downs in revenue in the area of company tax, they  need to have a plan to address that. They need to have a plan to address the carbon tax hole, the mining tax  hole, the NDIS funding hole and the Gonski funding hole. It is unacceptable in these areas where they have  had major new spending initiatives that they do not have major new savings.

In addition, we expect the Government to be honest about the debt requirements of the Commonwealth.  Previously, they had a debt ceiling of $75 billion and then they increased it to $200 billion and then $250  billion which they said they'd never pass, and then $300 billion. Now they need to be honest. If it's going to  be increased because of Labor's spending, then Labor has to increase the debt ceiling.

Furthermore, we expect them to be honest in expenditure. We will be looking closely, for example, at their  Budget for the boat arrivals which they said in February of this year were effectively going to stop because  of their policies, but since then we've seen a surge in the number of boats arriving. That is one of many areas  where we expect the expenditure numbers to tell the truth. Finally, Wayne Swan keeps saying this is about  jobs. I remind you of his solemn promise two years ago when he talked about the Budget being focused on  jobs, jobs, jobs. He said there would be 500,000 new jobs created in Australia within two years. Well, his  deadline is the 30th of June this year. He needs to create, in his words, 237,000 jobs in a few months. Now,  otherwise, that's yet another broken promise and the lesson out of all of this is don't make the promises that  you cannot keep and tomorrow night we expect the Treasurer to be honest. We demand that he be honest  with the Australian people and stop gilding the lily about the state of the nation's finances.

TONY ABBOTT:

Ok, do we have any questions?

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, your book of waste, at least the online version I saw this morning, outlines things you say about  waste in advertising, media monitoring, the number of staff in the Prime Minister's office, payouts to  terminated staff, Foreign Minister's travel and market research. Do you commit that a Coalition government  would not spend money in these areas, or would spend less?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, obviously, there is a certain amount of money which has to be spent in this area but we certainly don’t  believe that it needs to be as profligate as this government has been. Now, our full list of expenditure, the  spends and the saves, will be released in good time before the next election after the PEFO is released during  the campaign.

QUESTION:

So, a certain amount of spending you're saying is Labor waste is OK, it's spending above that that's  problematic?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I'm not against public servants having access to a kettle to boil the billy for morning tea but I don't  believe they need 15,000 gold-plated coffee machines.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, on item number 56 in the book you're critical of Labor for appointing people like John Brumby,  Anna Bligh, Mike Rann, Geoff Gallop, to various posts. Can you give a commitment not to appoint former  Liberal premiers or ministers to any positions?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, the issue here is the appropriateness of appointments. Now, I've got nothing against the appointment  of outstanding former members of parliament to diplomatic positions or to board positions. For instance, the  appointment of Kim Beazley as our Ambassador to Washington was a very worthy appointment and one  which was enthusiastically supported by the Coalition and having spent time with Mr Beazley in  Washington I would be the first to say he's doing an absolutely outstanding job. I think anyone who catches  up with Kim Beazley can only lament the choices that the Labor Party has made over the last few years. So,  I'm all in favour of good appointments. I'm not in favour of substandard appointments which are simply  rewards for mates and that's the problem with some of these.

QUESTION:

The majority of the money here, Mr Abbott, $6.6 billion is an overspend in immigration and border  protection. Is it your commitment to cut $6.6 billion from that area and, while I've got you, what's your latest  advice on the costing of your paid parental leave scheme? Is it still $3.5 billion or is it four or five?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, just on paid parental leave, we'll have more to say about our fair dinkum paid parental leave scheme in  good time before the next election, but I just want to pose this question to you and indeed to every  Australian: why is it right and proper for a bloke to be paid his full wage when he's on holiday or when he's

4



on sick leave and not right and proper for a woman to be paid her full wage when she's on maternity leave? I  think if you pose that question the answer is obvious. That's why I think our fair dinkum paid parental leave  scheme is a sign that the Coalition gets it when it comes to the reality of the modern Australian family and  the reality of the modern Australian woman. Now, on the questions of costings, obviously when we release  the full details of the policy we'll release the full details of the costings.

On the issue of asylum seekers, well, sure, that's the biggest single item in this book, but the book is not  pretending to be a comprehensive example of Labor's waste. If it was, it would be the size of a telephone  directory. It’s simply a snapshot of some emblematic examples of Labor waste. Now, the only way to end  the blowouts on border protection is to stop the boats and the only way to stop the boats is to put in place  policies that show you are no longer going to be taken for a ride by the people smugglers and the trouble  with this government is that it has essentially given up. In the war against the people smugglers, this  government has just surrendered and frankly it's pathetic that an Australian government should be so supine  in the face of this challenge to our nation.

QUESTION:

Does it concern you that some employer groups are saying that big companies will scale back their paid  parental leave schemes. Does that show that there would be a cost shift from the private sector to the public  sector with no net gain for a woman working at one of those companies?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, it would be a very considerable gain for women and for parents to be getting six months at their full  wage and, as I understand it, there are very few, if any, private businesses that are currently providing that  kind of a scheme. So, I think I can safely say that everyone is going to be better off under our scheme, even  if companies scale back their own schemes and as I've made very clear from the beginning, it would  certainly be open for a company to scale back its scheme if there is a better scheme in place thanks to a  Coalition government. But let's never forget that this scheme is proposed to be funded by a levy on larger  businesses, one in 200 companies will pay the levy. So, it continues to be funded by business. What we also  want to be able to do is to make head room for that levy by a reduction in company tax.

QUESTION:

You've said you will release some details of your own savings and so on after PEFO and that's in plenty of  time for the election, but in fact that's only very few weeks before the election. How can you defend that sort  of timeframe? And secondly, can you just reconfirm that you will be campaigning for the yes vote in the  local government referendum?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, quite easily we can defend that timeframe because in the last two elections the Labor Party has  released its costings the day before polling. It has released its costings on the Friday afternoon. So, we’ll do  vastly better than that and I should also point out, Michelle, that there are various savings measures such as  the discontinuation of the school kids bonus that we've been very upfront with people now for quite some  time and there will be further savings that we will be announcing independently of the comprehensive list  that will come out after PEFO.

On the local government referendum, the Government still hasn't told us exactly what its proposal is. Now,  it's a bit rich of the Government to claim bipartisanship when it hasn't actually taken us or the public into its  confidence over precisely what the wording of this referendum will be. We have some reservations about it  because we think that the Government hasn't done the work necessary to get a yes vote. It is rushing this  through in the lee of an election. Typical of this Government, everything is rushed out at the last minute to  generate a headline rather than to get a result. The other reservation that we've got is that frankly they

5



shouldn't be muddying the waters of this election which ought to be a referendum on Julia Gillard and the  carbon tax rather than a referendum on local government. That said, since Malcolm Turnbull's time as  Opposition Leader, we have supported an appropriate recognition of local government and we certainly do  think that it's important to continue the Commonwealth's ability to be able to pay money under programmes  such as Roads to Recovery direct to local government. Next one?

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, when, if ever, will you move a motion of no confidence in this government?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, we have said we will move a motion of no confidence. We will move a motion of no confidence in  this government. Simon Crean and Martin Ferguson don't have confidence in this Prime Minister, so it's  right and proper that we should give the Parliament an opportunity to move no confidence in the  Government. It's right and proper that we should give the independents a chance to demonstrate whether  they retain any skerrick of independence or whether they are simply Labor members in Canberra pretending  to be independent members in their electorate.

QUESTION:

When will you move it?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I would expect a no confidence motion to be debated in the next sitting fortnight.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, I want to just ask you about how strong the Coalition's commitment is to that Millennium  Development Goals signed by the Howard Government and particularly the increase to 0.5 per cent of GNI.  Does it depend on the numbers? Do you support it unequivocally or are you willing to shelve it?

TONY ABBOTT:

We do support it, we are committed to it, but obviously when we can achieve it depends very much on the  state of the Budget. Now, the Government has delayed it now twice. We will be making our decisions about  this when we see the state of the books tomorrow night and then again in PEFO. But it remains for us, as I  believe for the Government, an aspirational goal.

QUESTION:

Can I ask…Mr Abbott, Mr Abbott…

TONY ABBOTT:

Laura. Ladies first!

QUESTION:

Yes, I won’t have to yell so much. There are some things you don't have to wait for for PEFO. One of them  is you've suggested that you can get the tax ratio lower than it is with the Government at the moment. Why  can't you give a commitment or an indication of what you regard as an appropriate level of government  spending as proportion of GDP, for example, under a Coalition Government would be? Whether there's a

6



target for government spending overall that you would be aiming for and would that be driven by tax  revenues or by something else?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I'll say something about this then I'll ask Joe to add to it, but the problem is not revenue, the problem is  spending. The Government's revenue is $70 billion more today than it was in 2007. The problem is that the  Government's spending is about $100 billion a year more now than it was in 2007. Now, sure, the  Government likes to talk about percentage of tax today but all of that spending, that 25 per cent of GDP that  they're spending, has got to be paid for by tax and the fact that the tax is not being raised today just means  that there's going to have to be more tax tomorrow because the spending that's not being paid for by today's  taxes and is being paid for by today's borrowing is going to have to be paid for by tomorrow's taxes. So, I  just think this is a complete furphy that the Government keeps running around citing. Joe, over to you on  that one.

JOE HOCKEY:

Well, Laura, one of the first things we will be looking at tomorrow is trying to identify the underlying  assumptions behind the revenue forecast. I've been saying for weeks now including in the Parliament that if  you look at the European price, if you look at Point Carbon's assumption about where that's heading, then an  assumption of $29 a tonne in 2015 is plainly ridiculous. The Government has, whether it's intentionally  leaked or unintentionally leaked, $15 a tonne. Plainly, that is ridiculous. I'd like to know what the underlying  assumptions are for that, if that's the case.

QUESTION:

What about spending?

JOE HOCKEY:

Well, in terms of expenditure, when you look at the boats and the fact that in February the Department of  Immigration dramatically cut its forecast expenditure on boats and yet April was the worst month for  unlawful boat arrivals in Australian history. I mean, it makes a mockery of the expenditure forecast. So, I  think the important thing for us is tomorrow night in a measured manner and over the days ahead we will go  through and we will peel back the charade of the Budget and try to identify what the underlying assumptions  are. We'll be using estimates, we'll be using where possible, and though we’re running out of time, FOIs,  we'll be using the Parliamentary Budget Office. We'll be using every vehicle available to try to find out what  the underlying assumptions are and we'll be matching it with the forecasts that they will be putting in for  growth and employment growth and also inflation.

QUESTION:

Can I ask you about constitutional recognition of local government again? What attitude will you bring to  members, MPs and senators in your party who will not support this and probably cross the floor and I ask  that because if you don't have bipartisanship, then I understand that there would have to be taxpayer funding  of the no case in which case there are a couple of blank pages at the bottom of Jamie's book, for number 61  which would be the waste of money that that would entail given it would be likely a failure?

TONY ABBOTT:

There should be a proper discussion of any constitutional change. There are some constitutional changes  which have succeeded over the years. There's a couple of constitutional changes which you can imagine that  I would be supportive of, particularly indigenous recognition. But any constitutional change should be  properly considered by the Australian people and it's right and proper that those who don't support the

7



change to recognise local government, whatever that might be, because I stress the Government still hasn't  told us what it is, but it's right and proper that whatever it is, those who want to see this exposed to proper  scrutiny should have the chance to make their case. So, subject to further discussion in the Shadow Cabinet  and in the party room, it would be my intention to allow at least two members of the Coalition to cross the  floor so that they can then prepare, should they wish, a no case so that there will be a proper debate about  any proposal that the Government puts forward.

QUESTION:

Can you give a guarantee today that an Abbott government would be prepared to spend less on government  advertising, spin doctors and consultants than the current government is?

TONY ABBOTT:

The short answer is yes. Certainly, when we went into the last election we announced in our pre-election  fiscal measures some significant savings and I think you can anticipate something like that again as we go  into the next election.

Lyndal to Joe.

QUESTION:

Mr Hockey, you put out a press release with Andrew Robb a couple of weeks ago in which you said  returning the Budget to surplus and keeping the AAA credit rating will be paramount. Does that mean many  of the things the Coalition has committed to since last election delivering in its first term may have to wait  until the Budget is in surplus?

JOE HOCKEY:

I know where you're going, Lyndal. I'm not going to respond to that. You’ll see the details of all of our  policies prior to the next election, but I’d just say to you, before people do say, well how will you respond  with a surplus and so on, I think one of the problems that the Labor Party has had, it's always made big,  bold, unqualified statements and then failed to deliver and that just undermines business and consumer  confidence. We are determined to be measured and thoughtful. We will respond to the facts as they stand  and when we've done that you will see our pathway back to a better Budget.

QUESTION:

Will you do any better than a two per cent cap on spending?

JOE HOCKEY:

Look, the fiscal rules that Labor laid down, which I think you're referring to, are a complete joke. Wayne  Swan said he would have a surplus over the cycle. Well, I suggest that that cycle is now a millennium.

TONY ABBOTT:

Could I just say that Joe and I are absolutely on the same page here. We are absolutely on the same page  here. The number one priority for an incoming Coalition government has got to be to restore the nation's  finances. Now, we've said time and time again, let me repeat it again today, this election is not going to be  an auction. We will be responsible, we will be careful, we will be frugal, we will be prudent. Not for a  second will we deny the Australian people the hope, reward and opportunity that they deserve but the best  way to deliver that in the medium term is to get the nation's finances back onto a sound footing.

Thank you.
