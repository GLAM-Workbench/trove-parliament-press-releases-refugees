E&OE……………………….………………………………………………………………………………..

TONY ABBOTT:

It’s great to be here in Adelaide. It’s great to support the South Australian Division of the party. It’s good to  be in the presence of my federal parliamentary colleagues from South Australia, it’s also good to be  supporting Isobel Redmond who has done a really outstanding job and the recent state budget just  demonstrates that the Labor Party can’t be trusted with money and they certainly can’t be trusted to keep  their commitments.

On that score, I want to say that when we look at the Federal Labor Government, two days, two  commitments compromised. Yesterday they said that maybe there would be a carbon tax after all, having  vehemently denied that there ever would be during the election campaign. Today they’ve announced a  massive expansion of detention centres at Curtin Airbase in Western Australia and at Scherger Airbase in  Queensland having furiously denied any such plan during the election campaign.

What this demonstrates is that this is a government which has already broken faith with the Australian  people and frankly it should be judged very harshly by the Australian people. It’s just not right for  governments to say one thing before an election and do something quite different afterwards.

QUESTION:

Do you think that the plan was always on the radar before the election but it just didn’t rise above the radar?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think this is a government which has not been straight with the Australian people. I think that the Labor  Party has trouble with the truth. I think this is a political party that will say and do anything to stay in office  and I think the Australian public are getting very disillusioned with that sort of politician.

QUESTION:

Do you agree with Christopher Pyne in relation to the Speaker issue and the pairing issue that Rob  Oakeshott wants?

TONY ABBOTT:

I very much support Parliamentary reform. I was advocating Parliamentary reform before the election,  whereas the Prime Minister only came on board after the election when she had too. So, I completely  support Parliamentary reform and I also support doing what’s reasonably necessary to ensure that the  Parliament can function given the closeness of the vote in the parliament. But I do make the point that the  pairing arrangement will be much easier to manage if a member of a major party is the Parliamentary  Speaker.

QUESTION:

…are there any circumstances under which you would support Rob Oakeshott for the Speaker’s job?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, it’s up to the government to nominate a candidate for the Speakership. It is the government which has  that responsibility. If the government were to nominate Mr Oakeshott, well then obviously we’d respond  appropriately.

QUESTION:

Christopher Pyne said that the Opposition actually preferred Mr Jenkins to remain as Speaker, is that your  preferred position?

TONY ABBOTT:

I’ve always said that what I’d like to see us move towards is a Westminster-style Speakership. The  Westminster Speakership is really a model for Parliamentary democracies and I think the best way to  establish a Westminster-style Speakership in this country would be for Mr Jenkins to continue in the Chair,  but having said that, it is ultimately a matter for the government to nominate a Speaker. I’d be interested to  know whether the Prime Minister is still supporting Harry Jenkins or whether the government has decided to  put someone else up. It is first and foremost the government’s responsibility to nominate a Speaker and I call  on them to make crystal clear now who their candidate for the Speakership will be.

QUESTION:

Have you spoken to Mr Jenkins at all about this?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, I’m not going to go into who I might have spoken to and the content of conversations.

QUESTION:

Just getting back to the alterations made for asylum seekers, what does that now tell us about border  protection in Australia?

TONY ABBOTT:

What it says is that this government has completely lost control of our borders. If we didn’t have the boats,  we wouldn’t need the detention centres and the only way to avoid the problem that Labor has got us into is  to stop the boats. Now, you can stop the boats but what is necessary to stop the boats is first, temporary  protection visas, second, rigorous offshore processing, preferably in a third country and finally, the

preparedness in the right circumstances to turn boats around. Now, Kevin Rudd promised before the 2007  election that he would turn boats around. This government has comprehensively failed to honour that  commitment.

QUESTION:

When you talk about an appropriate response to what arrangements are made between the PM and Mr  Oakeshott, can you say what you mean there? You’re not sort of planning any spanner in the works process  yourself?

TONY ABBOTT:

We will honour the agreement that was entered into for Parliamentary reform. We made the agreement in  good faith and we will keep the agreement. Obviously, how that agreement is translated into Standing  Orders has yet to be determined but we support Parliamentary reform. We supported it before the election,  we weren’t dragged kicking and screaming to this principle after the election because we had no choice, but  I just reiterate that it is the government’s responsibility to nominate a candidate for the Speakership and I  call on them to nominate their candidate immediately.
