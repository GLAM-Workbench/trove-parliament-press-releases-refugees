ANZUS COMMUNIQUE

Following is the ANZUS Communique issued in Washington  by the ANZUS Council on 27 February 1980.

The 29th meeting of the ANZUS Council was held in  Washington on the 26 and 27 February 1980. The Honourable  Cyrus Vance,  Secretary of State of the United States,  the  Right Honourable Brian Talboys,  Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign

Minister of New Zealand,  the Honourable Andrew Peacock,  Foreign  Minister of Australia,  and the Honourable D.JÃ¢ÂÂ Killen,  Minister  of Defence of Australia,  represented their respective GovernmentsÃ¢ÂÂ

In opening the meeting,  the Secretary of State  emphasised its.particular importance in view of the new interÂ­ national situation stemming from the Soviet invasion of  Afghanistan. He and the Ministers for Foreign Affairs and  Defence of Australia expressed their great appreciation for New

Zealand's willingness to advance the date and change,the'venue of  the meeting.

The Council members agreed the invasion of Afghanistan,  a non-aligned country,  was a blatant violation of the Charter of  the United Nations. The Council noted that this action had been  condemned by an overwhelming majority of the members of the  General Assembly and by more than 35 Islamic Foreign Ministers  meeting in Islamabad.

The Treaty partners further agreed that the Soviet  invasion of Afghanistan challenged the independence of all States.  The Soviet action calls for appropriate political responses  according to national interests and capacities,  as well as for  defence preparedness. The Council recognised that individual  nations could contribute in different ways to promoting a stable  international order and to strengthening the political environment  against threats to national independence. It recognised that firm

support by the international community for the sovereignty and  independence of small countries,  especially developing countries,   must be accompanied by international co-operation in the economic  field to which all members of the United Nations should make a

fair contribution, in order to strengthen the economies of developÂ­ ing countries and to establish a more effective and more equitable  international economic order.

The use or threat of force by the USSR against countries  vital to the flow of petroleum to the East and West could,  the  council agreed, endanger the independence and economic viability  of many nations,  both developed and developing. In the discussion

V

of recent events in Afghanistan, emphasis was placed on the  importance of a strong,  consistent,  and enduring stand in  opposition to the use of force in extending Soviet or other  influence over sovereign governments, The Council members  agreed on the importance of convincing the USSR that it cannot  profit in the long run from such actions. They further agreed

that the complete withdrawal of all Soviet forces from AfghanÂ­ istan and the restoration of a truly non-aligned,  neutral  government in Afghanistan responsive to the wishes of the  Afghan people were necessary for the security and peace of the

region.

The American Council member outlined the economic  measures which the United States had taken vis-a-vis the Soviet  Union in the wake of the invasion of Afghanistan, He expressed  appreciation for actions already taken by the other Treaty  partners in their relations with the USSR, The Council members

agreed on the desirability of close consultation on these matters.

In view of the failure of the Soviet Union to withdraw  its troops from Afghanistan, the Council agreed that it would  not be appropriate for the summer Olympics to be held in Moscow, It considered that the Olympics should be transferred to another  site or sites and noted proposals that,  if necessary,  alternative  competitions should be arranged in the latter half of 1980 in  which all world-class athletes would be invited to participate.

The Council agreed that there would be close and continuing  !  consultations among the three Governments on this question.

The Council also discussed the composition and level of  forces in the Indian Ocean that would be appropriate to demonstrate  allied support for security of the area and determination to deter  further Soviet adventurism. It agreed to explore fully the  possibilities for enhancing the effectiveness of the Treaty  partners' military activities in the Indian Ocean,  without preÂ­

judicing the fulfilment of their respective responsibilities in  the Treaty area. The Council reviewed United States plans for  its military presence in the Indian Ocean and the Arabian Sea, These included enhanced maritime surveillance and anti-submarine  patrolling,  increased military training and assistance to various

countries in the region,  and arrangements for secure access into  the Indian Ocean for alliance forces. The Council, noted that  later in the year Australia will deploy a carrier task group  in the Indian Ocean led by the aircraft carrier HMAS Melbourne,  Naval and air support will be given by New Zealand as resources  permit.

The Council took note of the decision to allocate  greater resources to defence announced by the Prime Minister of  Australia on 19 February, They further noted that consultations  on joint co-operation at both operational and policy levels take

on a new urgency in the uncertain strategic prospects resulting  from the present South-West Asia crisis,  that operational planning  in response to the crisis is well under w a y ,  and that additional  measures for military co-operation are being explored.

Council members reiterated the importance of preventing  the further spread of nuclear weapons,  and expressed concern that  development and spread of the capability to acquire nuclear  weapons would further harm security and international stability.

The American Council member informed his colleagues  that,  despite the adverse political climate engendered by the  Soviet invasion of Afghanistan,  effective mutual constraints on  strategic nuclear weapons remain of great importance in ensuring  world peace and security. For this reasonÂ»  the U,S, Administration

remains firmly committed to ratification of the SALT II agreement  and to the general principle of seeking effective and verifiable  arms control agreements as a matter of national interest and  policy. The Australian and New Zealand members welcomed a

continued emphasis by the United States on arms control and  disarmament measures that enhance security, including the CompreÂ­ hensive Test Ban Treaty (CTB), In this regard, the Council  acknowledged that the current military and political climate is  not conducive to resumption of US-Soviet talks on arms limitations

in the Indian Ocean,

The Council members considered the tensions along the  borders of Indochina resulting from the invasion of Kampuchea by  Vietnamese forces sustained by Soviet support. They expressed  their strong concern over the danger to peace and stability

arising from the present crisis and their desire to see the  withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from Kampuchea, '

The ANZUS partners strongly endorsed efforts of SouthÂ­ East Asian countries to bring about the restoration of peace and  security in their region. They reaffirmed their support for the  UNGA resolution, sponsored by the members of the Association of

South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN),  which called for the Kampuchean  people to be able to choose democratically their own Government,   without outside interference, subversion or coercion.

With regard to tensions along the Thai-Kampuchean border,   the Council viewed with particular concern the possibility that the  hostilities could spill over into Thailand, The Council called on  Vietnam to respect Thailand's territorial integrity and to avoid  actions which would endanger the civilian Khmer concentrations

along the border, or risk escalation of the fighting or confrontÂ­ ation with Thai military units. The Council stressed the great  importance it placed on Thailand’s security and territorial,

integrity, and noted the continued relevance of the Manila Pact,

Noting the great suffering inflicted on the Kampuchean  people, the Council members strongly emphasised the necessity for  continuing relief efforts within Kampuchea and along the border  of Kampuchea and Thailand, They also underscored the requirement

for international efforts to deal with the problems of refugees,   hunger and disease until displaced Khmer can return to their  homes and they called upon the authorities in Kampuchea to coÂ­ operate with the international relief program.

The problem created for many of the countries of SouthÂ­ East Asia as a result of the persisting refugee exodus from Vietnam  was reviewed by the CouncilÂ» The members noted the continuing  importance of the humane policies of first asylum of countries in

the region,, They expressed gratification at the very large number  of refugees resettled outside South-East Asia during the past year,   which has relieved pressures on first asylum countries of the  region. The opening of the Bataan refugee processing centre and

the prospective opening of the Galang RPC were also viewed as  significant additions to the ability of the region to cope with  the refugee problem,  as was the decision by China to take an  active part in refugee resettlement. Members agreed on the need  for continuing world-wide participation in refugee resettlement  and support for the UNHCR Indochina program. They called upon  Vietnam to refrain from creating internal conditions that motivate

its people to attempt to escape. Recognising that several  thousand Vietnamese flee their homeland each month despite all  handicaps, members reaffirmed support for the principle of responsiÂ­ bility of flag states for refugees rescued at sea. In those

instances, where flag states did not accept this responsibility,   members supported other means to assist the refugees such as  through the sea rescue resettlement reserve of the United Nations  High Commissioner for Refugees,

In addition to the tragic plight of Indochinese and -Khmer refugees, the Council members took particular note of the  many thousands now fleeing the occupation by Soviet forces of  Afghanistan, The Council urged that all independent Governments

contribute monetarily or in kind to the international, and humaniÂ­ tarian effort, co-ordinated by the United Nations High Commissioner  for Refugees,  to maintain the Afghan refugees until they can  return safely to their homeland. The Council noted with  appreciation the efforts of the Pakistan Government to receive  and care for the Afghan refugees, ;  .

Welcoming the accession of Kiribati to independence  since the last Council meeting, the Council reaffirmed the  importance it attaches to the peaceful progress of the South  Pacific,

The Council welcomed the expression of concern by South  Pacific governments in response to the Soviet invasion of  Afghanistan, The Council reaffirmed the commitment of the ANZUS  partners to co-operate with the South Pacific states in support ,

of a common interest in a secure and peaceful environment in which  the South Pacific countries can most effectively pursue their  national policies. It welcomed the continued development of

regional co-operation among the Pacific islands.

The Ministers took note of progress made towards selfÂ­ determination in the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands and  welcomed the increased participation of the Micronesian governÂ­ ments in regional organisations, Ã¢ÂÂ

The Council noted the increased importance of its members  reducing their dependence on imported fuels in the light of recent  events in South-West Asia, They recognised that recent dramatic  increases in the price of oil will also have a disruptive effect  on the economies of both developed and developing countries and  may cause serious strains in the international"financial system.

The respective delegations accordingly agreed that there is a  serious neied to pursue strong measures to reduce oil imports,   bringing prices for domestic crude oil to'world levels,  and  substantially greater efforts to use and develop alternative

energy sources. They noted the degree of co-operation that had  already been achieved within the International Energy Agency on  these issues. They also considered the effect on the economies of  the developing countries of the dramatic increases in the price  of petroleum and agreed to continue to provide development  assistance and to consult these countries in an effort to overcome  this effect.

In reviewing the situation in Iran,  the Council agreed  that the seizure and holding of American personnel as hostages  is a blatant violation of international law, diplomatic norms,  and human rights. The Australian and New Zealand representatives

reaffirmed their sympathy and support for the United States and  the American hostages. The members of the Council emphasised the  importance of the hostages' speedy release.

In addition to the special problems arising from the  crisis in South-West Asia, Council members reviewed the conduct  of the alliance since the 28th Council meeting and expressed themÂ­ selves satisfied with the continued high degree of co-operation and  consultation. They took note of the regular program of exchanges,  exercises and visits carried out by the armed services of the  three allies and the contribution these have made to the readiness  of the members to support one another in periods of military danger  of natural disaster. In this regard, they were particularly  gratified that a second exercise in the Sandgroper series will  be carried out in the Indian Ocean off Western Australia later  this year. Satisfaction was also expressed with the success of

the other exercises carried on over the past eight months in the  various series established under the alliance.

The Council members concluded by agreeing that the  30th meeting of the Council will be held in Wellington in 1981  at a date to be decided.
