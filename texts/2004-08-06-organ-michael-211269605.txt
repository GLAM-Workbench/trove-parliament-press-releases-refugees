BILL OF RIGHTS ONE WAY TO DEFEAT  INDEFINITE DETENTION



Greens Federal Member for Cunningham Michael Organ has called for a Bill of  Rights to be incorporated into Australian Law to curb the ability of the  Government to detain people indefinitely.

“Today, the High Court has found that it is lawful for the Government to lock  people up forever without charge.  While it may be lawful, its certainly an affront  to decency and human rights.  I’m appalled at this Government’s rotten policy  that allows such a thing to happen.

These laws make every immigration detention centre in Australia another   Guantanamo Bay- at least there though the US Courts gave detainees the right  to challenge their detention - and all because of the US bill of rights, so it’s a  lesson for Australia.

In the absence of abolishing mandatory detention as the Greens advocate, a Bill  of Rights would over ride punitive laws that allow for people to be locked up  forever and protect us all from these kinds of horrific laws now and in the future.

Minister Vanstone would have you believe that the Government has adopted a  softer approach to asylum seekers over recent weeks. Now the facts are  revealed and this new found heart is nothing more than a charade.”  Michael  Organ said

The Government is conducting a war on civil liberties and they must be stopped,”   Michael Organ MP said.
