REFUGEES WILL STAY .  .  '  .  .

STATEMENT BY THE MINISTER POP FOREIGN AFFAIRS, TB.B HON.  ÃÂ. S. PEACOCK.

I HAD A DISCUSSION LASTING APPROXIHATELY 30 MINUTES WITH TUB '

VIETNAMESE CHARGE P*AFFAIRE THIS MORNING.  Ã¢ÂÂ   Ã¢ÂÂ

BE PUT TO ME THAT THE GOVERNMENT OF VIETNAM'S VIEW WAS THAT

THE VESSEL OUGHT TO BE RETURNED AND THAT THE' PERSONNEL, WHOM

BE DESCRIBED AS PIRATES, OUGHT TO BE RETURNED TO VIETN AM .  Â·  '

I INDICATED TO a m  THAT AS SOON AS THE QUESTION OF OWNERSHIP

OF THE VESSEL WAS RESOLVED, THAT VESSEL COULD BE RETURNED TO .

VIETNAM. '  ’

BUT, SO PAR AS THE PEOPLE WERE CONCERNED, THOSE WHO WERE /

GENUINE REFUGEES WOULD BE PERMITTED TO REMAIN AND THOSE WHO .  /

WISHED TO RETURN TO VIETNAM COULD DO SO. IT HAS OF COURSE J

BEEN RAISED - THE QUESTION HAS BEEN RAISED. - AS ..'TO WHETHER THIS IS A BREACH OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS. IT IS NOT, OF '

COURSE, IT IS A DIFFERENCE- BETWEEN OUR TWO GOVERNMENTS ON

A BASIC QUESTION OF HUMANITY, AND ON THAT POINT WE WILL NOT

b u d g e .

BUT THE DIFFERENCE OUGHT TO BE SEEN WITHIN THE CONCEPT OF,

.AND THE PERSPECTIVE OF, OUR OVERALL RELATIONSHIP WHICH IS A

GOOD WORKING RELATIONSHIP. .  K

WE HAVE NOT SOUGHT ANY CONFLICT WITH VIETNAM ON THIS QUESTION

AND WE WILL- NOT,  BUT WE WILL REMAIN FIRM ON THIS BASIC QUESTION  OF HUMANITY. '
