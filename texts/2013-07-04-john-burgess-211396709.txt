E&OE……………………….…………………………………………………………………

JOHN BURGESS:

He’s off to Mandurah today with the Premier and I’m talking to the Leader of the Opposition, Tony Abbott. Good morning, Tony.

TONY ABBOTT:

G’day Burgo.

JOHN BURGESS:

How are you doing?

TONY ABBOTT:

I’m well and thank you for talking to me.

JOHN BURGESS:

That’s my pleasure. I thought I would get into this pretty quickly. I have been talking to a lot of folk around the place who have  been raising the point that the last time we had a vote we ended up with Rudd and then we ended up with Gillard and now we

have got Rudd back again. It seems to me that the caucus on a whim seems to change Prime Ministers. Everybody is saying to  me, Tony - when is the election so we can have a say?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, that is so right, Burgo. I think people are very, very frustrated because their choice is constantly being usurped by the

faceless men of the Labor Party. In 2007, we voted for Kevin and we got Julia. In 2010, we voted - well, some of us did - for Julia  and now we have got Kevin. And in 2013 if we vote Labor who knows what we will end up with? But I suspect it won’t be Kevin for

very long because the faceless men will have another go at him. So, if you want certainty and stability we have just got to change  the Government and that means voting for the Coalition.

JOHN BURGESS:

Right, well, I mean no matter what your politics might be, Tony, I think I would make an assertion that people are sick to death of

what has been going down and we know something, we need to get on with it.

TONY ABBOTT:

And look, we need a government which is competent and trustworthy and that is the last thing that we have had, first under Mr  Rudd and then under Ms Gillard. It has been deal after deal, betrayal after betrayal, ineptitude after incompetence and whether it

is the boats that are out of control, the deficit that is out of control, all of these new taxes and regulations which are just mounting  up every day. This is a government that just can’t be trusted.

JOHN BURGESS:

Now you mentioned the boats and I know it is a huge, huge problem but I have got a bee in my bonnet this morning, I have to say.

Earlier this morning in our news, a person by the name of Pamela Curr who apparently is associated with the Asylum Seeker

Resource Group and she came out and said that these asylum seekers, they are being put into the community with no clothing,  no money, no beds, no mattresses, no food. She said for a rich country like Australia it is shameful. I made the point that maybe

Ms Curr doesn’t realise as well, that there are people - I mean, with asylum seekers a lot of them come here illegally - there are  people born in this country with no beds, no mattresses, no food and no clothing and in a rich country. That’s shameful

TONY ABBOTT:

Yeah, Burgo, look, you make a very good point. The people smugglers are playing us for mugs. We are being taken for a ride.

They’re having a lend of us and it is just wrong. But the interesting thing is Mr Rudd has put the people smugglers back in the  game. John Howard stopped the boats. Kevin Rudd started the boats. John Howard took away the people smugglers’ business

model. Kevin Rudd has given it back to them and this is the problem that we have got - the guy who started the boats is never  going to be able to stop them.

JOHN BURGESS:

Yes, well, as I said it is a big problem so we look forward to the election announcement to be made and I would like to talk to you

once again when that comes to the fore, Tone.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, the interesting thing, Burgo, is that under Julia Gillard much was uncertain but at least we knew the election date. Even that  is up in the air now that Mr Rudd is back and my instinct is that he will want to push the date out and out because he thinks that

you campaign for the Prime Ministership of Australia in St Petersburg and elsewhere and I keep saying to people, look, it  shouldn’t be about Mr Rudd’s ego. It should be about what is best for the Australian people.

JOHN BURGESS:

Well, I don’t think we need debates and things. We need a date, that’s for sure. It’s great to talk to you.

TONY ABBOTT:

Thank you so much, Burgo.

JOHN BURGESS:

Have a safe trip down to Mandurah. Of course coming from Canberra they are talking about being about two degrees here

tomorrow morning but that is almost summer conditions for you, Tony.

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, Canberra has been cold but I have got to say I stuck to the gym at the hotel this morning. I didn’t go for my usual run around  the estuary there.

JOHN BURGESS:

Coward!

TONY ABBOTT:

Yeah, that’s right! It was just too cold and I could see some rain in the offing as well.

JOHN BURGESS:

Well, we need the rain, our average rainfall is way down. But anyway, nice to talk to you. We will again soon.

TONY ABBOTT:

Thanks so much, Burgo.

JOHN BURGESS:

Ok, Tony Abbott, Leader of the Opposition with Burgo on 6iX there.
