.  ELECTORATE TALK

The Jubilee Year Royal Tour of Australia has been an outstanding  success 1 The Queen and Prince Philip have been greeted w i t h

;  w a r m t h , genuine affection and friendship. I cannot recall a  more open and warmer reception on any previous Royal Tour.

In a real sense, the tour to all s t a t e s , the Northern Territory,

and the Australian Capital Territory plainly has illustrated just  h o w  Australians feel about the Monarch. It has proved beyond any

doubt that Australians want to continue their links with the  Monarchy. It proves Australians value its great role.

The Monarchy, w i t h  the Queen as its head, is an intrinsic part

of our Constitutional process. There is an inbuilt importance  attached to the Executive C o u n c i l , which comprises the Governor  General, the Queen's representative, and senior members of the  G o v e r n m e n t .  The Monarchy is in a sense the last area of appeal.

It is the last b u l w a r k , the last safeguard to make sure that all

t h e 'processes are being properly and constitutionally carried o u t .   The Mona r c h y  -is also important because Australians want stability  in i n s t i tutions, so that they can plan ahead w i t h  a real degree

of security.

Of c o u r s e , stability does not mean there is no requirement for  c h a n g e . What it does mean is that progressive policies can be

applied and developed w i t h  "a stable Government framework. Policies  do and ought to change as requirements alter. But it is important

that the framework of Government remains stable and predictable.

During the tour, some me d i a  prominence was given to demonstrations  that sought to draw attention to the Republican cause. I believe

there are very few Australians who w a n t ’anything to do w i t h  a.  Republican form of Government. Surely, the central message from  this tour is that the overwhelming majority of Australians have  great loyalty to the Crown and to the system of Government it

-  e m b o d i e s . I see no cause to move Australia along a Republican

path. I do not agree with those who say it. is inevitable. It

w o u l d  be a tragedy for Australia, for I believe w e  would be less

well governed.

In a farewell message, the Queen made the point that the right to

dissent was a freedom we enjoy in Australia - a freedom: w h i c h  sadly

does n o t  exist in other countries. I believe that signs of dissent

in a country as vigorous and individualistic as Australia is a

hea l t h y  sign. It is healthy as long as it is non-violent, and

does n o t  interfere w i t h  the rights of others. If there was no

dissent in Australia, I think it w o u l d  be fair to ask what has

been w r o n g  w i t h  our spirit. There has always been argument and

dissent publicly displayed in Australia. It is one of the fundaÂ­

me n t a l  privileges that we strive to maintain.

In the Federal Parliament this week., the Minister for Employment anf  Industrial Relations introduced legislation for the establishment c Â·   an Industrial Relations Bureau. .  .  .  .

This Bureau, is a central feature of our industrial relations policy,  w h i c h  sets out two clear p r i n c i p l e s :  each member of our community  has b o t h  rights and obligations; individual rights can be protected,  equally, obligations can be met.

The one point about the legislation^ that I want to stress is the

p r o t ection it gives to i n d i v i d u a l s . 'T h e  Industrial Relations Bureau  will protect the rights of individual m e n  and women against the wror

actions of either employers or unions. It will be able to act on it

own initiative to protect those rights without having to wait first  for a complaint.

The Government regards the protec t i o n  of individual, rights as both  fundamental and inalienable. This Bureau will strengthen that  commitment. ,  .

The legislation will not become law, immediately. It will lie on the

table of the House to give ample time for full and constructive debat.  I believe, however, that m a n y  who had criticised the Bureau without:  seeing the legislation will understand the considerable personal  benefit it brings to m e n  and w o m e n  throughout Australia. .
