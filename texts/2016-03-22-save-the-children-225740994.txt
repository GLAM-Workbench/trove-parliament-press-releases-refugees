Turnbull Government must re-imagine Bali Process so that it protects rather than breaks people seeking  asylum

A high-level task-force led by Australia and Indonesia meant to prevent people trafficking and migration by  sea in south-east Asia is instead breaking asylum seekers whom have risked everything to seek safety from  war, conflict and persecution, warns Save the Children.

The warning comes on the eve of a high-level conference co-chaired by Australia involving 45 countries and  UN agencies that since 2002 has so far failed to adequately protect people, prevent people trafficking and  irregular migration by sea in south-east Asia.

Instead of an Asia Pacific wide solution that seeks to protect asylum seekers and provide  safe pathways for those in need, Australia has served its own self-interest and left people seeking asylum  in limbo in Nauru and WE'*X*_

Notes to editor  Out of the 60 million people forcibly displaced from their homes, the Asia Pacific region is home to some 7.7 million (more than  12 per cent), including 3.5 million refugees, 1.9 million IDPs and 1.4 million stateless people (UNHCR).
