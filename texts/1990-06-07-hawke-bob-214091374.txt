PRIME MINISTER

UNEDITED TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH KERRY O'BRIEN, ABC  DATELINE, 7 JUNE 1990

E & ÃÂ E - PROOF ONLY

O'BRIEN: Mr Hawke,  welcome to the program.

PM: Thank you very much indeed, Kerry.

O'BRIEN: Before we get down to that somewhat massive reform agenda, there are some obvious follow-up questions  to the comments that you made yesterday on Chinese  students in Australia. First, are you concerned about  the impact of your comments on the Chinese Government,

particularly in view of the rapidity with which they've  called the Ambassador in to protest?

PM: When you have the responsibility of conducting the  affairs of this country you've got to take a range of  considerations into account including, of course, what  reactions of foreign governments may be to the decisions  you take here, but pre-eminently at least while I'm Prime  Minister, the decisions that I take and this Government

takes will be the ones which I believe to be in the  interests of this country and are necessary to discharge  its responsibilities both to our Australian citizens and  internationally.  When I apply those criteria, there is  no doubt, but that we have an obligation to those Chinese  people who were here before the events of June of last  year. I've made it clear on behalf of the Australian  Government and, I believe, the Australian people, since

that time that, in a sense, these people are in a special  category and the Cabinet will very shortly determine the  details of that,,but I've made it clear that we will  continue to ensure, at least while there is any degree of  uncertainty about their fate should they return to  Australia (sic), that they will not be so required to

return.

0 '-BRIEN:  Acknowledging that we don'  t yet know how many of these students are going to be given that special  status,  but you're talking about approximately 20,000  before June of last year and some further 20,000 since  who might also be reviewed. Now if the final number of

students who are given that status is substantial, will  that effect the numbers of your broader immigration  program?

2

PM: Well, let me go to that in two parts, Kerry. Let's  make the distinction between those who were here before  June the 20th of last year and those who came afterwards.   What I've said earlier in the answer to you applies most  particularly to those who are before the events of June  of last year. The assumption in regard to those who came

after approximately June the 20th, the assumption in  regard to those people would be is that they would  normally be expected to return to China, but let me make  it clear that any of those people or any others,  for that  matter in this country, always have the right to apply

for refugee status under the appropriate procedures.  And  now - coming to the second part of your question as to  numbers - we will take these things into account in  fixing the overall level of people that we decide should  be coming to this country into this country in the period  ahead. But this doesn't mean, doesn't mean that because  we will be looking after those Chinese people in that  category of pre-Tienanmen Square,  that we will therefore

automatically wipe out the other refugee component in our  program.  That doesn't follow and it won't.

O'BRIEN: Alright, if it's not going to necessarily wipe  out the other refugee component, what's it going to do to  skilled migrants or to family sponsored migrants?

PM: Well this is a matter that has got to be taken into  account by the Cabinet when we're considering these  matters,  but you've got to remember that in regard to the  people that come into the category of Chinese that were  here in the pre-Tienanmen Square situation, not all of

those are unskilled so it's not one or the other. But we  will make a decision as to the level of intake which  meets the criteria, Kerry, of skill requirements, family  reunion requirement, business migration - all those

elements that go into the total of the migration target  and we'll set the target at what we, as a Government,  believe is appropriate for Australia.

O'BRIEN: Do you believe that those students who came to  Australia post-Tienanmen Square have a right to public  protest, to express their public protest in Australia?

PM: Well, I - this is a democracy.  This is a democracy  and they must make their own decision about how they  conduct themselves within a democracy, but Australia is  not going to.be a country which prevents any of its  citizens, provided they abide by our law and our

processes, provided they abide by our law and our  processes,  then they will be free to do that and it is a  judgement they must make.

O'BRIEN: But in doing that, they then run the risk of  incurring the wrath of the Chinese Government and I am  referring particularly now to the 20,000 students who've  come since Tienanmen Square. If they demonstrate  publicly, can't they then turn to you and say I have now

3

incurred the wrath of the Chinese Government,  I'm scared  about going home, please keep me here?

PM: Well, let me say that you will have heard what I've  already said, that I draw the distinction between those  who came and I think roughly .  .  . the date would be about  the 20th of June in terms of making a decision, vis a vis  Australia. In regard to all of those before that date,

then they could be said to carry the assumption of being  at risk and however, in regard to those who came after  that, there is no such assumption. The assumption that  we would make in regard to those people is that they  would go home and the decisions that would be taken by

the processes that are in place here - we have the,  what's the Dawes process, so that's the determination of  refugee status. Any such people in that category who may  choose to make an application ... as is their right, well

in regard to those people, the way in which they'd  conducted themselves after they'd been here - whether  they in fact were judged to have deliberately attempted  to create a situation which would give them refugee

status, would obviously be a factor that would be taken  into account by the Dawes Committee.

O'BRIEN: Good luck to the Dawes Committee trying to work that one out. Are you concerned,  as I understand some of  your economic ministers are, that these English language  programs that the Chinese students have come to, have

actually been operating as much, in the students' terms,  as a backdoor migration process?

PM: Well it was obvious - the ministers have expressed  some concern about that.  I mean . .. nothing new or path  breaking about that. Those observations have been made  and indeed -O'BRIEN: But those observations go back a couple of  years,  I think at least in private.

PM: Yes, but what I'm saying, what I'm saying is that  the ministers concerned are taking the steps to ensure  that we will try and have a, get a situation which will  combine the obvious criteria that we should have and that

is of providing a service and, may I say, a foreign  income earning service, but one which is not going to be  abused. There have been abuses - they will be eliminated  as far as they possibly can.

O'BRIEN: But hasn't the horse bolted to a degree -PM: No -

O'BRIEN: - to the extent there has been abuse.

PM: Well, obviously in any area of human activities, if mistakes have, have occurred,  then there is no point in  denying that, but the good sense of a good government is  to review and see if there have been mistakes or

4

X

loopholes to see that they are remedied so that you can  provide a service which is in the interests of the  students and the interests of this country, but which is  not open to abuse and that1s what's being done.

O'BRIEN: OK. Let's get down to the economy now. If I  could start with that wonderful term, sustainable  development.

PM: Yes.

O'BRIEN: Ed Shann, with Access Economics who was on our  program last week, says that in a survey they've done  there are something like $36 billion in investment  projects on the drawing board in mining and manufacturing  under consideration now that could go ahead at any time.  But about 45 percent of those are subject to  environmental veto. Now, what urgency is there about  your ministers producing their guidelines across the  range of industries so business can actually get on with  the business of producing these exports that are going to  help us trade our way out of trouble?

PM: The question is misplaced to some extent,  Kerry, in that that assumes that the work that we are doing in the  area of sustainable development has to be completed and  the guidelines have to come out of that before decisions  can be made in regard to the projects that you mention.  Well, that's not right. The decisions can be made in

regard to these projects under the existing processes for  environmental impact statements that are required at the  Commonwealth and the State level and of course that has  been happening up until now and will continue to go on.  What we're about at this stage with the work that I

initiated last year on sustainable development is to try  and get the cooperation of the various sectors of  industry involved, as well as the environmental movement,   to see if we can in fact get a more cooperative structure  which will ensure a smoother process in these various  areas, but -O'BRIEN: Well, when do you expect the goods to be  delivered in that regard?

PM: Well, quite quickly. I indicated last year when I brought together the industry and the environmental  organisations and my ministers that we would prepare a  significant paper setting out the concept of sustainable  development.  That has virtually been completed. I  expect that within this next month a paper, a significant  paper, will be circulated to the people who participated

in that meeting here in the Cabinet room last year. I  will expect responses from the organisations represented  at that meeting last year. If the case is, Kerry, that  they are satisfied with that paper as it stands,  then we  can go straight into the establishment of the working  groups in each of the industry sectors. If they decide

that there are matters that have arisen in that paper

5 (K

that they want to have a discussion with us about, then I  will reconvene them so that we can try and sort out any  areas of difference there may be and then immediately go  into the sectoral discussions on the basis of the agreed  paper as to sustainable development concept.

O'BRIEN: So very briefly, would you hope to have that  all tied up by the end of the year?

PM: Certainly. I mean, when you say tied up, .  .  .  the  paper will be out within a month,  within less than a  month and then it1  s up to them and assuming that they are  not going to take a long time in their responses or  raise, you know, unreal difficulties, then I would expect

sort of well within this year for the actual sectoral  groups to be into their work.

O'BRIEN: OK. Telecommunications.

PM: Yes.

0'BRIEN:  You're virtually going to turn the industry on  its head in the next few months. All the reviews,  as I  understand it, will be finished by the end of this month.   What kind of time frame are you going to try to put on  your Cabinet coming to a conclusion on the, across the

range of elements, so that you can come up with a  complete policy?

PM: Well, I would be expecting that by - let me broadly  put it this way - by the time of the Budget I would be  hoping that we would have significant decisions to make  in this area. That's not to say, Kerry, of course and I  don't think that's implied in your question, that every

aspect of what is a vast and technically complex sector  of our economy and an intrinsically important area, but  that every 'i '  will be dotted and 't '  crossed, but I  expect to be in a position to make significant decisions

in that sort of time frame.

O'BRIEN: Kim Beazley seems somewhat attracted to the idea of a Megacom - putting Telecom, OTC and Aussat  together. Do you have any fundamental objection to that  concept?

PM: I am not wedded to any concept at this stage, nor,  may I say in fairness to my friend Kim, friend and  colleague Kim Beazley, is he wedded. I mean, he

certainly has indicated that there could be some  advantages in a Megacom concept ... I think h e 1s  indicated that he could see some advantages in that, but

his mind is not closed on this and certainly mine is not.  There is, I mean, there are some very fundamental  considerations that you have to take into account here.  The important thing that we've got to do for Australia is

to ensure that we get the most effective delivery of  services.  That's what ... about. In other words w e 're  not, our criterion is not privatisation or some .

6

ideological concept about these sort of things. The  issue is how do we most effectively deliver the range of  services in the whole telecommunication industry which  are so important to the competitive position of  Australian industry. And that's the criterion which will  move me and my colleagues.  Now within that framework,  Kerry, you've got the alternatives, there is, as you  rightly say, the concept of the Megacom which would see  Telecom,  OTC and Aussat merged together.

O'BRIEN: Now if you did have that you would have to have  a strong foreign competitor.

PM: Well, that's one of the arguments that obviously  arises. What would be the source of competition in that  situation. Whereas those who argue the other way, and  this obviously has to be looked at, is that OTC, and  certainly OTC itself argues this, that by the nature of

their organisation and their capacity and expertise, that  they are well placed to provide effective competition to  Telecom. Now what we have got to do is to ask ourselves  the questions. What will be the decision which will be  most likely to produce for all Australians the best  outcome. And we will not, in that approach, allow any  one particular group or organisation to say, because they

see their best interests as being served by a particular  outcome, that that is the root to arriving at the best  answer. There can only be one criteria for government in

this - that is, what is going to provide the most  effective and competitive service.

O'BRIEN: OK. Now let's look at one of the bigger,  another very large area of reform and that is transport -PM: Yes.

O'BRIEN: - road transport, rail transport, waterfront.  And if you throw in energy as another separate component,  the one thing that links all of these and that is that  you are going to require a great deal of State  co-operation. In the end it's the States that are going

to deliver much of these things.

PM: You are right there Kerry, you've put your finger on a very important proposition. May I say that if you look  at what's been happening in this area, if you look in  this current financial year, the Commonwealth trading  enterprises will be turning in a profit of about $2.2  billion and the States combined losses of about $2  billion are the same amount. Estimates have been made,  Kerry, by the Industry Commission and others that suggest

that there are savings of over $2 billion that are  available in terms of getting a State transport system  operating more efficiently. Now I don't say those things  in terms of trying to be bellicose in regard to the

States, I recognise the difficulties they've had, but you  are absolutely correct in putting your finger on the  importance of getting co-operation with the States and

7

may I say that at the Premiers'  Conference coming up at  the end of this month ... Kerry, I'll be seeking to get a  positive response from the Premiers,  to get their  understanding of how important ... the best way -O'BRIEN: But let's -PM: No, let me make this point to you so that you and  your viewers can best understand the importance of  getting the co-operation of the Australian States. In

just two years from now in 1992 when you've got the  development of Europe and the bringing together of Europe  under the Communities timetable. In 1992, when that is  completed, you will have those States of Europe who will  have less restrictions,  a more open basis of economic  movement of goods and services between those twelve  countries of Europe than there will be the States of  Australia. Now that is a situation which I regard as

intollerable. We've got -O'BRIEN: But what can you do about it?

PM: Well what you can, I mean, I can't change the Constitution and say we are a one national state. The  fact is that we are a Federation under this Constitution.   I accept that fact. But surely what we have got to do as

intelligent people, whether the Prime Minister of  Australia or a Premier of a State is to understand that  we are condemning this generation and future generations  to a lowered standard of living, if in fact we are not  prepared to co-operate to ensure that in this vast  country, which depends so much upon its land transport

systems, for instance,  that we eliminate the stupidities  as far as we can of the uncoordinated and competitive  systems which characterises this country.

O'BRIEN: But the unfortunate political or uncomfortable political reality for you is that most of the Premiers  are Labor Premiers and we have already seen the kind of  trouble that the Cain Government has had in Victoria in  trying to deliver reform within their transport system.  The fact is that in trying to implement these reforms -

in rail alone potentially you're wiping out 50,000 jobs.   You've got the potential for truckle blockades right  around the country.  You're going to require six State  governments to deliver political will to you and do you

really believe, in all reality, that that can be done?

PM: I've go the political will and I don't look at my  State colleagues and throw up my hands in hopelessness,  and believe that they haven't got a concern for the  welfare of their citizens and for the welfare of the

future of Australia. I think they have. But if we  approached every task on basis of saying, well there are  difficulties therefore we won't do anything about it,  then we'd be back in the cave. We've got to recognise

that there will be problems,  there will be obstacles,  there may be threats of opposition. But I haven't in

8

seven years now allowed threats to stop me from doing  what it think necessary in the interest of this country.

O'BRIEN: Well over the period of your Government, you  haven't been able to deliver an Australian Securities  Commission because of the obstruction from the .  .  .

PM: Well, we've certainly had obstruction from the States, but let me say this, that I think my colleague  Michael Duffy is reaching a point - at least I understand  that, Kerry, from the very recent conversations I have

had with him in the last 24 hours or so, that we are  going to overcome that one. Now I don't think,  Kerry,  that I'm going to help the process by simply now getting  into a slanging match with my State colleagues -O'BRIEN: But what I would put to you is this. Is it  time that we all grew up about this and endeavoured to

try and come up with some more sophisticated framework,  if you like, even if the Constitution can't be changed in  the short term? Is it time to evolve a new relationship,   a new -PM: That's precisely what we're about.  That's why we're  not just talking about this, but we've taken the steps.

I mean, for instance, the most obvious things are the  reports that we've already got from the previous interÂ­  state Commission and with Ted Butcher, the previous head  of that, also doing reports for us, on these issues but

in addition to that, after consultation with the States,  may I say, we have agreed references to the Industries  Commission in the area of the railways and energy. Two

important areas which are critical to what you are  properly addressing in your questions to me. Now with  their agreement,  we've got references to the Industry  Commission. Now I think that, of itself, is an

indication that my colleagues in the States understand  the need for a national approach. Otherwise they  wouldn't have agreed to the reference of these issues -  railways and energy - to the Industries Commission. Now  out of that process with the national body, the

Industries Commission, and with an input from the States  and the Commonwealth, looking at the nature of the  problems and the opportunity for rationalisation, then I  believe that we've started on the new path which you are  quite right, we condemn ourselves to a lesser future if  we are satisfied to live in the inadequacies of the past.

O'BRIEN: And this is a real test of you as national leader isn't it?

PM: I accept that.

O'BRIEN: I mean, you've got to pull them on side  somehow.

PM: I accept that and we've already gone some way down  the path. But as I say, Kerry,  the fact that we've got

VÂ· Â·

9

their agreement to the references to the Industries  Commission - I mean, to their credit I think that  indicates that they are men and women - in the case of  Carmen in Western Australia - that they are people who do  understand that if they're going to do their duty, they  can't look at themselves as just Premiers of Western  Australia, New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, South  Australia, that the welfare of the citizens of those

States is dependent upon having cooperation between the  States and with the Commonwealth.

O'BRIEN: OK. Let's move on. You and the Treasurer have  placed great store on your financial deregulation, that  major reform. It seems that almost no-one argues against  that any more, that it had to happen.

PM:  Yes.

O'BRIEN: But at what cost to the economy? At what cost?

PM: Well, at what cost and what advantages? I mean -O'BRIEN: Well, let's, I mean, we acknowledge the  advantages.

PM: Well good, OK.

O'BRIEN: At what cost?

PM: Well, at a cost of what always will happen in a  competitive market economy. I mean, it's a fact of life  that governments are not here as wet nurses to stop  people making mistaken judgements whether they are

individuals or banks or enterprises and individuals and  banks in combination. They are going to make judgements  about whether an idea or an enterprise that they have  will, over time, be capable of funding itself in a way  which will meet the financial obligations associated with  undertaking that enterprise and a way which will give, in

the end, a return to those initiating it and cover those  financing it. That's the nature, the essential nature of  a competitive capitalist society -O'BRIEN: So to the extent -PM: What we did was to create a situation where we would  go as far as we could to ensure that there was a widest  possible range of financial intermediaries and

institutions and that has been the price. Now in that  process during the period since 1983, it has become clear  that there was an exuberance -O'BRIEN: Some call it greed.

PM: Well, and my friend, in a capitalist market economy greed is always present.

10

O'BRIEN: Well what do you do when that greed starts to  interfere with your national strategy for our economy?

PM: What you - you make a decision as a society, that  people are grown up and mature and adult - that we are  not going to do, we're not going to turn the clock back

towards what Eastern Europe - Eastern Europe has been the  controlled economies. They are the ones who thought  Daddy in central government knew best and Daddy will tell  you what to do and how you will allocate your resources.   Well, my God, what a price they pay for the Daddy knows

best syndrome.

O'BRIEN: OK.

PM: But when you don't follow the Daddy knows best  syndrome, but when what Daddy does is to say well look  here's the widest possible range of intermediaries, now  within it, you make the decisions. When they make bad  decisions, you don't then say do we go back to the Daddy  knows best syndrome when we tell you what to do and

regulate you.

O ’BRIEN: Well we last night on the program had a look at  the end result of a rash of those bad decisions, Mr  Hawke. We looked at something like a $10 billion  minimum,  $10 billion fire sale of quite substantial  Australian assets, many of which are going to end up in

foreign control. Can I just now play an excerpt of what  two quite well respected businessmen had to say to say on  the program about the ramifications of this?

PM: Sure.

(excerpt of last night's interviews)

O'BRIEN: Mr Hawke, I'm not suggesting that the  Government should suddenly come up with some mandatory  percentage figure beyond which there should not be any  foreign money, across the rash of industry.  But is it

time in these particular circumstances,  we're in  unchartered waters in many ways in this economy, is it  time for the Government to review broadly its foreign  investment policy and perhaps the role of the FIRB?

PM: I don't think so. I've got no evidence before me to suggest that that is necessary. Let me remind you that  we have the mechanism of the FIRB and you will have a  government which will be watching this scene and I can

assure you Kerry, and I can assure your viewers that we  will not sit idly by and as a result of mistakes that  have been made, mistaken decisions that have been made by

entrepeneurs and their bankers, we won't sit idly by if  in the washing up of the process which flows from their  mistakes some vital national interest were at stake and

which could go into the control of foreigners in a way  which could be against our national interest. One of  your people there said it is a very fine line at times,

- Â· :: Â·Â·Â·Â· : - Ã¢ÂÂ  / Â· Â·  - Â·

11

and it is. But we - and for instance just recently we  made a decision in regard to the television industry.

O ’BRIEN: That one you can understand to a - I mean that's easy to explain. People might object to it but  it's easy to explain.

PM: ... easy to explain Kerry and I hope you'll accept  the explanation. Not everyone did.

O'BRIEN: Not everyone did. It's arguable. But at least  you can argue a case there.

PM: Sure.

O'BRIEN: What about something like brewing for example  which is really basically about people drinking beer and  buying beer. Yet it's a big cash earner for Australia,  it's a big employer for Australia.

PM: It is.

O'BRIEN: Does it worry you at all, the prospect of Bond  Brewing, which controls 40% of our market, might end up  in the hands of a foreign corporation?

PM: Let me say this,  that as a pretty well identified -O'BRIEN: Ex-beer drinker.

PM: No, no, no. Very ex, ten years. But as a very well  identified Australian nationalist, I would prefer our  resources by and large to be owned and to develop,  organised by Australians. But I also am a citizen of the

world. I understand, as I've said on many occasions  Kerry, that if my kids and their kids are going to have  their future best looked after it'  s going to be in an  Australia which gets the best it can from foreign  experience and foreign technology. Now I'm not saying it  necessarily applies to brewing but I just make the point,  don't let's be xenophobic about our interests.

O'BRIEN: (inaudible)

PM: Let me finish. I insist on this that our interests and the interests of my kids and of their kids depends  very much upon having a sensible blend of Australian  nationalism and aggressive Australian nationalism with

the best that we can get from overseas.  Now I can assure  you as far as I'm concerned and this Government is  concerned, we won't idly stand by and allow assets to go  overseas if there is no benefit to Australia associated  with that ownership change and if there is an available

and sensible Australian ownership.

O'BRIEN: You must be disappointed to a degree that Paul Keating's great hope of seeing Australian corporations  flourish into multinationals and carry Australia's

12

interests into other countries,  business interests into  other countries.  Because it would seem that that has  floundered. In fact the reverse -PM: No, no, come on...... you talked about, you've  talked about the collapse of one or two high flyers -O'BRIEN: (inaudible)

PM: How much time have you spent, what about doing some  programs - and I know this is, with one of the names I'll  mention ... say Hawke's mate - but I '11 go to him  straight away. Why don't you go to TNT? The fact that  here you have an Australian enterprise which is arguably

the largest transport enterprise in the world, operating  in 70 countries round the world.

O'BRIEN: OK, but that's one -PM: That's only one.

O'BRIEN: But Paul Keating was hoping there'd be a lot  more by now -PM: But there are a lot more. I said that's one.  That's a big one. But in the transport industry as well

as TNT you've got Brambles,  you've got Mayne Nickless and  in the area of building construction materials you've got  our companies in Europe, in the United States operating  there. We've got very very considerable success stories  to tell of Australian enterprises abroad.  And it's a  pity, it's a pity that more wasn't talked about what they  are doing because they are -O'BRIEN: What about Alan Bond, what about John Elliott,  what about, what about Abe Goldberg etc, etc, etc?

PM: I'm not trying to ignore the failures.  But what I'm  saying is it's a very very one sided picture to talk  about the ones that you've mentioned and never hear a  word about the magnificent achievements of our great  Australian companies in so many areas - transport,

building materials, and other areas of services and  industry.  I mean you've got Australian enterprises doing  brilliantly well around the world and in the end it  becomes a question of whether you've got intelligent  people making sensible decisions. And Australians, no

less than Americans, Japanese, Frenchmen and Germans,  no  less than the rest of them are incapable of making  mistakes. Some of them make mistakes and make pretty  gigantic ones. But just like other countries but without

the publicity that they should get we also have  Australians who've done brilliantly well and are  continuing to do it against the hardest and toughest  competition in the world.

O'BRIEN: But this also happens to be unfortunate timing  to say the least in terms of the state of the economy.

13

PM: I just don't follow that at all. I mean I'm simply  saying that we have a situation where the Australian  economy has done remarkably well over the last seven  years. We've had a rate of economic growth which is on

average twice that of the OECD. We've had a rate of  employment growth which is more than twice as fast as the  rest of the OECD. I don't think that's a very bad  achievement.

O'BRIEN: We've got a rate of inflation that continues to

PM: But a rate of inflation which has not been  inconsistent with a doubling of the rate of growth of the  rest of the world and a doubling of the employment  growth.  It has been sustainable inflation which has  never at any point in the last seven years got back to  what it was at the beginning of the 80s and which is

trending downward.  It's 8.6% now. It's accepted  generally amongst economic commentators it will be down  at six per cent by June of next year.

O'BRIEN: Are you happy with that? You're happy with -PM: I'm certainly happy that's it's going from 8.6% down  to 6%. I'd be a mug if I wasn't.

O'BRIEN: Is it enough? '

PM: Well, you can always do better and I think we'll  have it going down further.

O'BRIEN: By the middle of next year?

PM: I've told you by the middle of next year we believe the figure will be down to six per cent from about 8.6%  now.

O'BRIEN: You don't believe there's any chance of it  being lower than six by the middle of next year?

PM: I think six per cent is a reasonable figure to be  aiming at. That's the sort of figure we're working on.  And that will be a significant reduction.

O'BRIEN: And are you picking up vibes from the Reserve  Bank that perhaps the pace should be faster than that?

PM: It's not a question of picking up vibes. I've seen what'  s been attributed to the Reserve Bank.  It's not a  question of the Government and the Reserve Bank being at  odds. There are two fundamental economic challenges  which this country faces in terms of economic aggregates.   One is the external account. We've got to get the  current account deficit down. And inflation is the

other.  We believe we've got the appropriate mix of  policies to do that. It's very interesting, as you will

14

have noted Kerry, no doubt, the statement by Westpac  yesterday, our leading private bank, which gives not a  complacent picture but it gives a very very positive  picture about the next three year period for Australia.

O'BRIEN: I also saw today's employment figures where  employment -PM: Come again.

O'BRIEN: I repeat the question. I also saw today's  employment figures which showed a rise of employment of  23,000 jobs when we were expecting to see a reduction of  10,000. I mean it -

PM: I must say if you could get your cameras on the  Libs, they'd be shedding their tears, great bucketfuls of  them. Here they were talking about recession and .  ..  when we got the national account figures which showed a

1.8% increase, that led Dr Hewson to - what was his  magnificent phrase? ÃÂ  rather patchy period of  flatness.'

O'BRIEN: But doesn't this just mean -PM: Might I say by the production figures for the last  quarter, for the March quarter which has just come out  which have shown a significant increase, now the  employment figures. Now I don't say from all that that  we haven't got problems. But I do say that if you've got  the March quarter, if you've got the national account

figures showing a 1.8% increase, if you've got the  production figures for the March quarter showing a 1.2%  increase,  you've now got the employment figures showing  an increase, it's pretty hard, it's pretty hard to  reconcile those figures with deep recession which is what

the conservatives in this country were desperately hoping  was happening.

O'BRIEN: But what people seem to now feel is that what  we're going to have instead is a long slow period of kind  of staggered recession. In terms of those employment  figures isn't there a strong chance that we're just

looking at a longer pipeline and a bigger crunch at the  end of it? ,

PM: No, I don't think that's right. I think the figures  that have come out, the ones that I've referred to, the  national accounts figures, the production figures and now  the employment figures, are consistent with what Bob  Hawke and Paul Keating have been saying for some time. And that is that we have applied a mix of fiscal, wage  and monetary policies which have been calculated to have

something of a slowing of the rate of growth that had  been occuring before but as distinct from the  conservatives ... never handled this. When they've had  expansion and it's got too much for them, they had to

take the country into recession. What we've been saying

15

.  . .  appropriate set of tight policies in those three  areas that we have in fact been able to move towards a  much softer landing. And unfortunately for our political  opponents and the jargon with which they have been arming

themselves,  the facts are tending very much to support  Hawke and Keating and not the Jeremiahs.

O'BRIEN: We're just about out of time Mr Hawke but one  last point. There is also a suggestion that you could  apply a one-off circuit breaker on inflation. Perhaps

not with Accord Mark VI but certainly with Accord Mark  VII. Do you consider that there will be a possibility of  another wage-tax trade off using the surplus  substantially for that circuit breaker?

PM: No, I believe that we've got the appropriate wages  policy in place now. I mean you just don't pile another  policy on top of another policy like that if you want to  have some degree of predictability and certainty in the  community. Both those whose incomes you're talking about  and those whose costs you're talking about. Now the

business community and those who are employed as well as  those who employ now have a pretty clear understanding of  what the wages outcome will be for this period ahead of  them. I don't think it makes sense to be interfering  with that. We are in a situation where inflation is

significantly trending downwards.  That's what we want.

O'BRIEN: Bob Hawke, thanks very much for talking with  us.

PM: It's been my pleasure Kerry. Thank you very much.
