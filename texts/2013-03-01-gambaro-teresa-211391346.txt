TONY ABBOTT:

It’s terrific to be here at Street Level, here in the electorate of Brisbane with my friend and colleague Teresa  Gambaro. I want to thank the Salvation Army for everything they do for so many tens and hundreds of  thousands of people right around Australia. Whenever there is trouble the Salvation Army is there.  Whenever people are going through difficult times the Salvation Army is there. They don’t judge, they just  help. This is our society at its best. This is an example of people caring for people, which I think is quite  heart-warming and I really do want to congratulate them on this new centre.

Brisbane is a great city. Brisbane is a wealthy city, but even in a wealthy city like Brisbane there can be lots  and lots of people who are doing it tough and the Salvation Army is here to help. I like to think that, as I say,  this is our society at its best. I have often said that it is not what you have to do but what you chose to do  which is the measure of a person. It’s not what you do for money but what you do for love which is the mark  of someone’s character. The Salvos, they dedicate their lives to helping others. All of the volunteers and all  of the community members who have come to help the Salvos here, they also deserve our thanks and  gratitude. I know Teresa Gambaro is very proud of the work that is being done here and the work that will  be done here so I will ask her to say a few words.

TERESA GAMBARO:

Tony, it’s great to welcome you to the opening of Street Level and I just want to thank the Salvation Army  for the great work that they do in the Brisbane central area, particularly with young people and we have the  Youth Centre here next door which will be a fantastic new addition and where they will be able to provide  transitional care, food and all of the support services. We met Eric earlier who has now been able to  transition to get his taxi licence and has a stable future ahead of him. So, I just want to thank the Salvation  Army. I want to thank all of the businesses who have become involved today, particularly the ones who  were responsible for building and putting together this fantastic facility. So, thank you again to the Salvos.  You’re legends. Thank you very much.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, what action will be taken against Arthur Sinodinos for failing to declare earlier his link with  Australian Water Holdings?

TONY ABBOTT:

My understanding is that Arthur made a statement to the Senate last night and my understanding is that now  he believes that all the requisite disclosures have been made.

QUESTION:

Should he have declared it earlier?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, obviously there are rules and people should comply with the rules. The shareholdings in question as I  understand it were not for profit shareholdings.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, you have been going on about Eddie Obeid and his links to New South Wales Labor and now  Arthur Sinodinos has been tarnished in the same way. So, how can you keep the attack up on New South  Wales Labor when your own side is tarnished?

TONY ABBOTT:

There is a world of difference from exploiting an official position for personal gain and inadvertently  overlooking to declare a couple of not for profit directorships.

QUESTION:

Do you support Scott Morrison’s comments that asylum seekers should be identified as to where they are  living in the community?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think we need to get this whole thing in perspective. Now, the people in question have come to Australia  illegally by boat. Because we have had more than 30,000 people come to Australia illegally by boat since  the current government changed the system that worked, our detention centres are overflowing and people  have to be released into the community. Now, these are people whose status is as yet undetermined. We  need to know where they are so that if they are found to be refugees they can be notified and their lives can  be regularised. If they are found not to be refugees they can be notified and if necessary brought back into  detention and sent back to their home countries.

QUESTION:

But you think the public has to know about it, do you? Obviously, the Government knows where they are  but why does the public need to know where they are?

TONY ABBOTT:

That’s the whole point, the Government doesn’t know where they are. The Government doesn’t know where  they are but the Government has to know where they are - if they are found to be refugees so they can be

notified; if they are found not to be refugees so if appropriate they can be sent back to their original  countries.

QUESTION:

So, do you endorse Scott Morrison’s comments on asylum seekers? Yes or no?

TONY ABBOTT:

Obviously, the Government needs to know where people are and at the moment people are just disappearing  into the community. At the moment we have got a situation where the boats are coming in ever greater  numbers, our detention centres are overcrowded and overflowing, thousands of people have been released  into the community without any supervision and the Government has lost control of the system. The  Government...

QUESTION:

So you do endorse Scott Morrison’s comments?

TONY ABBOTT:

Of course. The Government has to maintain control of the system. This is a Government which has not only  lost control of our borders, it has lost control of boat people once they get into our country.

QUESTION:

So, would you be pushing for a registry of asylum seekers if you were in government?

TONY ABBOTT:

It's very important that people whose status is yet to be determined are being monitored by the Government  but the Government needs to know where they are. If they are found to be refugees they need to be  informed. If they are found not to be refugees they may well need to be asked to leave the country, so  you’ve got to be able to stay in touch with these people.

QUESTION:

Eric Abetz did make a comparison there with a paedophile registry and an asylum seeker registry. Were  those comments going too far?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, I’m not aware of the comments so I just simply can’t say anything about them.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, what would you say to members of your party who are concerned that Scott Morrison has been  racially vilifying refugees?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I just think that’s wrong. I just think that’s wrong. I think the best thing we can do here is stop the  boats. If we stopped the boats, we wouldn’t have a problem, we wouldn’t have overcrowded detention  centres, we wouldn’t be needing to house illegal arrivals in the community, we wouldn’t have the difficulties

that we’ve seen in a number of places. So, look, Scott is doing a magnificent job alerting people to the fact  that there is a better way. The Coalition has positive plans to stop the boats. We would start by putting in  place the policies that worked to stop the boats under the former government; that is rigorous offshore  processing at places like Nauru, temporary protection visas to deny the people smugglers a product to sell  and the option of turning boats around where it’s safe to do so. Now, those policies worked in the past, they  can work again in the future. The other very important addition is to have a good relationship with Indonesia  and no government has done more to damage our relationship with Indonesia than the current one by  catastrophic decisions such as the instant banning of the live cattle export trade.

QUESTION:

The Costello report’s been released in Queensland today obviously and the Government is stuck between  asset sales or 50 years’ worth of paying off debt. Do you think that the way that the economy in  Queensland’s been handled, obviously one of the major economies in the country, is appropriate? Do you  think that, you know, we can get out of this hole?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think that the problem is that the former Labor Government left this state in some respects a basket case. I  mean, this is a state with great people and great industries and great businesses, but the former state Labor  Government left the state’s finances in an absolutely parlous condition. It lost its Triple A rating, we saw the  employment of 60,000 additional public servants over a decade. Is it any wonder that Campbell Newman is  faced with tough decisions? I’m confident that he will make the right decisions for the future of the people  of Queensland but the lesson for everyone else is you can’t trust Labor with money. You just can’t trust  them with money. They are addicted to spending, they are addicted to taxing and in the end it always ends in  tears.

QUESTION:

What’s your position on power privatisation?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, the Commonwealth doesn’t run power utilities and the best thing we can do for the price of power, the  best thing we can do to ease the squeeze on struggling families, on the forgotten families of Australia, is to  get rid of the carbon tax.

QUESTION:

Can you guarantee no changes to the Fair Work Act until 2016?

TONY ABBOTT:

I guarantee that there will be a restored Australian Building and Construction Commission. There will be a  registered organisations commission that will ensure that union governance is properly addressed and we  don’t see the kind of corruption scandals that we’ve seen in the Health Services Union and the Australian  Workers' Union. I can also guarantee that the pay and conditions of Australian workers will be safe under  the Coalition.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, will you support the Premier if he were to start to sell some of Queensland’s assets before the  next election?

TONY ABBOTT:

I support Campbell Newman. I think he’s doing a magnificent job. What he decides to do is essentially his  business but what I do know is that Campbell Newman is determined to safeguard the future of the people of  Queensland. He has got to put the state’s finances back on a sound footing. The best thing Campbell can do  for the people of Queensland is to ensure that the Queensland Government is not living beyond its means,  because if it consistently lives beyond its means as it did under the Labor Party, everyone suffers.
