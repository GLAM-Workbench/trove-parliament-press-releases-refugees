INTERVIEW WITH FRAN KELLY - 702 ABC SYDNEY

THURSDAY, 11 NOVEMBER 2010

Subject: Family Law

FRAN KELLY:  Well, confusing and troublesome. That’s how one former Family Court judge  described Australia’s shared parenting laws earlier this year. The laws were introduced by the  Former Howard Government in 2006. They’ve since come in for fierce criticism though from  academics, family welfare agencies, women’s groups and the legal profession itself. Today the  Attorney-General Robert McClelland has released draft changes to the Family Law Act - changes  that will give greater weight to the protection of children and expand the definition of family  violence. Robert McClelland joins us now from Sydney. Attorney-General, welcome.

ROBERT McCLELLAND:  Good morning Fran

KELLY:  Before we get to these Family Law changes, or proposals, can I just go back to the issue  we’ve been discussing there with David Manne- how significant is this appeal before the High  Court from these two asylum seekers? If successful could it unravel the whole regime of offshore  processing?

McCLELLAND:  Well that’s an over statement. The challenge has been to the offshore processing  regime. That was introduced by the former government, but we’ve just got to wait and see on the  decision. I think David Manne’s commentary on various options, was a considered commentary but  the Minister for Immigration will be making a statement, I think at about 1.30pm today when we  know the outcome of the case. Obviously we’ll give a very close consideration to the case and I  think it is fair to say it is a significant case.

KELLY:  If upheld, though, it could lead to thousand of refugee hopefuls appealing their  deportation before the courts.

McCLELLAND:  I think as David Manne said there are various options for review but I think  we’ve just got to wait and see what the High Court decides, whether it upholds the law or whether it  says there are additional review mechanisms required. But we’ll wait and see what that outcome is.

KELLY:  Okay minister let’s go to the changes you’re proposing to the Family Law Act. The aim of  these changes is to better protect children caught up in family violence. How exactly will they do  that?

McCLELLAND:  Well firstly we’re expanding the definition of family violence to include not only  physical violence but also various guises of psychological intimidation whether it’s constant  belittling, financial control, preventing people from seeing their family- things of that nature and  also expanding the definition of child abuse. If a child is in a situation where they witness that sort

of ongoing behaviour or indeed witness mindless damage to property in terms of temper tantrums  and things of that nature.

But we’ll also be removing the disincentives that exist in the act on the basis of reports we’ve  received, in respect to what’s called a cooperative parent provision where the court is required to  consider whether a parent has been cooperative in making the final orders it’s made.  There is  evidence that may have been a disincentive to people reporting concerns about domestic violence.

The other significant one deals with a provision currently in the Act that requires the court to award  indemnity costs against the party who unsuccessfully establishes allegations of domestic violence.   We propose to remove that and allow the court to exercise its general cost powers in considering  what cost orders it might make.

KELLY:  Okay, let’s go to those changes because they go to the complaints that have been made.  The 2006 shared parenting law made it difficult for women in some cases to raise allegations of  violence in the system. They were reluctant to do so. They were advised by their legal  representation not to do so for fear of being described by the court as ‘unfriendly’ and that could see  them as you’ve referred to, as you’ve said there hit with legal costs, or worse lose out in the shared  care arrangements.  So this is acknowledgement that this has been happening?

McCLELLAND:  The proposal is an acknowledgement of the reports that have been provided to  the Government that this certainly has been happening in some instances.

KELLY:  If these changes become law will women who may feel that they’ve been treated unjustly  in the courts over the past four years since the law was introduced have the right to revisit their  case?

McCLELLAND:  It’s very hard to give a general answer. It’s going to depend on each  circumstance, but people in this situation usually have an opportunity to seek a review of parenting  orders if they feel they’ve been made on the basis of false premises and so forth.

KELLY:  So would you expect that to happen?

McCLELLAND:  Not really. I don’t think we’ll see many of those. Bearing in mind that not many  cases end up going to final decision by judges. Most of these matters are resolved through  mediation.

KELLY:  Not necessary the family violence matters though…

McCLELLAND:  No that’s true. Look, we don’t consider there’s going to be a flood gate of  litigation to reopen cases as a result of these amendments. I don’t realistically think that will occur.

KELLY:  These are draft proposals for discussion. There will undoubtedly be concerns that this  matter we’ve just been discussing could lower the bar for allegations of violence and abuse and  could lead to more false allegations being made by one parent or the other. How will the courts  make their way through that?

McCLELLAND:  They already have that discretion in weighing up the veracity of a witness and  their account of what’s gone on. They do it every day and they do it very well every day and that  will remain the case. I should say, further strengthening that, there will also be an obligation on  legal advisors to report these incidences that fall within the expanded definition of violence. And  there will be also be a corresponding obligation on courts if these issues are raised to make further  inquiries.

So the whole focus is to air out and ensure that allegations of domestic violence and abuse are aired  so that the court can do something about them whether it’s compelling someone to have treatment-  whether it’s drug and alcohol counselling, whether it’s anger management, whatever it is. And to  better manage and respond to and protect victims of domestic violence and of course protect  children from being exposed to it.

KELLY:  Minister you commissioned the report from the former Family Court Judge Richard  Chisholm after the disturbing death of Melbourne Girl Darcy Freeman last year. She was thrown to  her death from the Westgate Bridge. Would these changes have saved Darcy’s life?

McCLELLAND:  Let me say he specifically didn’t comment on the case for several reasons in his  report but he was most firm in his recommendations that the disincentives to reporting violence  should be removed and it is certainly the case that we requested Richard Chisholm to inquire in to  these matter after that case.  Obviously those circumstances have been clearly in our mind in the  way we’ve developed these laws. It’s a criminal case which is ongoing now so I don’t want to go  further into it.

KELLY:  Minister, how will this change the presumption of equal shared parenting responsibility,  because criticism of the 2006 law was that the courts were putting that- the notion of shared  parenting- as the number one priority above sometimes the protection of children?

McCLELLAND:  Yes. We’re effectively switching the two around so that in considering their  discretion, courts will be required to have regard to first and foremost the welfare or the best  interest of the child and also that it will be under presumption or the attempts to have time with each  parent. It should also be added that the operation of the act furthers the implementation of the  Convention on the Rights of the Child. So while there will be men’s groups and women’s groups  who no doubt, and appropriately will be advocating in respect to their various positions in the  consultation period, the government’s priority is the best interests of the child.

KELLY:  There will be more discussion of this obviously and I’m sure with you, but Justice  Chisholm also recommended in his January report that a Violence Risk Assessment should be  compulsory for every case coming before the Family Court will that now be done in every instance?

McCLELLAND:  No but there’s already far more extensive training in place to both the family  relationship level mediators whether they’re with Legal Aid Commissions and so forth and private  practitioners to identify these potential alarm signals and similarly the judiciary lead by the Chief  Justices of both the courts are also implementing those sort of programs so there’s a much greater  awareness. We think it would be over done and unnecessary to have that sort of process of  interrogation in each and every case but certainly it is desirable to focus on those potential warning  signals.

KELLY:  It’s nine minutes to Eight on Breakfast. Our guest this morning is the Attorney-General  Robert McClelland. Minister if I could just switch to ah, a couple of other issues… last night Tony  Abbott in a public forum raised the possibility of electing judges in this country as a way of  ensuring tougher criminal sentences- what’s your reaction to that suggestion?

McCLELLAND:  Look I don’t think that’s ever been part of the culture we’ve inherited and it has  served us well under our system since well really eight-hundred years.

I think that would be a regressive step.

I think judges should be appointed and we’ve tried to ensure that judges at a Federal level at least  are appointed on merit by having a panel that recommends suitable candidates to be appointed. But  I think there is a real risk that if we elect judges who have some allegiance to a political outcome

Attorney General News Release 4

that we may see political decisions on the bench and that would be entirely undesirable and quite  inconsistent with the system of justice that we have inherited.

KELLY:  And Minister turning to the so-called Honeymoon Killer Gabe Watson who’ll be released  from gaol today. The Australian newspaper said that Federal Government officials asked him to  sign a statement acknowledging he may be executed if he’s returned to the United States. Is that  true, and why would our government do that?

McCLELLAND:  Well, this advice was given by Immigration Officials, but I’ve got to say entirely  appropriately.

He was considering, presumably on legal advice, returning voluntarily to the United States and  those officials- as I think responsibly they were required to do- were to point out the potential  consequences of him electing to voluntarily return. Advice I might say which one would think his  lawyer would ordinarily provide to him.

Upon the Department providing that advice to him, he elected not to voluntarily return, so he  actually acted on the basis of that advice given by the Department as opposed to his private lawyer.  As a result of him not voluntarily, returning he will be detained in Immigration detention on his  release from prison. I understand that the Immigration Minister is seeking appropriate assurances  from the Federal Government or the National Government of the United States as opposed to the  relevant state government, assurances that he won’t face the death penalty.

KELLY:  So he will not be deported before that time?

McCLELLAND:  He won’t be deported. And in circumstances where it is now a government  controlled process he won’t be deported until that appropriate assurance is given.

So I think that story and how it’s been framed, and the imputations made against officers of the  Immigration Department was really quite outrageous.

I think they acted entirely appropriately, always ensuring that the relevant person was properly  informed of the law in circumstances where one would ordinarily think that that advice would have  been provided by his private legal practitioner.

KELLY:  Robert McClelland, thank you very much for joining us.

McCLELLAND:  Thank you.
