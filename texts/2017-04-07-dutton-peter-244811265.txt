PETER DUTTON:

Well Ladies and Gentlemen thank you very much for being here. I am very pleased  to be here with Air Vice Marshal Steve Osborne who has taken over from Major  General Andrew Bottrell. This is the first time that we’ve been able to provide an  update in relation to Operation Sovereign Borders which I’ll come to in a minute.

But I wanted to say firstly, thank you very much to Austal. We’ve had a great visit  here this morning with Senator Chris Back and Senator Lynda Reynolds. It’s an  incredible facility and the $16 million dollar a year contract between Australian  Border Force and Austal for the maintenance of our Cape Classes is instrumental to  getting the service that we need out of these vessels. We aim for 300 days a year for  each of the eight Cape Classes that we’ve got and I’m very pleased to have been  able to board St George and to speak with the crew there. It’s a professional body of  men and women that we have in the ranks of the ABF and that was on display again  today.

So it’s a great arrangement, a great relationship that we have with Austal. It employs  local people here in Western Australia, but also across the country in terms of  suppliers and manufacturers otherwise. It’s an enduring relationship. We should be  doing more maintenance here in Australia and we should be doing more by way of  construction and investing in jobs and growth, not only in the WA economy, but  across the country so I’m very pleased to be here today.

As I say, I wanted to provide an update today in relation to Operation Sovereign  Borders.

I want to report for the first time today that in the month of March we had a vessel on  water that was returned and we returned 25 people of Sri Lankan nationality back to

Sri Lanka and that marks the 30th boat turn-back in relation to Operation Sovereign  Borders which means that about 765 people on 30 boats have now been returned.

This demonstrates to all of us that this threat of boat arrivals hasn’t gone away.

People smugglers messages are clearly still being heard and we need to continue to  work with all of our partners throughout the region to make sure that we stare down  this threat, to make sure that we disrupt ventures before they get onto water and  when they do get onto water, we should be in a position to deal with them as quickly  as possible.

I want to acknowledge the work of Operation Sovereign Borders staff led by Air Vice  Marshall Steve Osborne, but to all of the crew particularly on vessels involved and in  the air otherwise. As we’ve said, we remain absolutely resolute that we won’t see  new vessels arrive and we have worked with a number of partners and I’m very  grateful for the work they’ve done in relation to this vessel.

I’ll ask Steve to make a few remarks and I’m happy to take any questions.

AIR VICE MARSHALL STEPHEN OSBORNE:

Thank you Minister. I would just like to start by just reiterating what the Minister said  in terms of the ongoing success of Operation Sovereign Borders.

Certainly we’ve been very successful for some time now in making sure that no  boats have arrived in Australia illegally, but not only that, we’ve also had an impact in  reducing the number of attempts which is really good news.

Now while most people would be aware of the people - the men and women in the  Australian agencies, all sixteen of them, that contribute to Operation Sovereign  Borders - people might not be aware of the work that is also done regionally by our  partners who have a shared interest in undermining the threat posed by the people  smugglers.

So it’s only in the last month or so, for example, that Indonesia has had some great  success in disrupting people smugglers themselves. They have made a number of  arrests and a number of convictions which is great news for all countries of the  region and I would just like to express my personal thanks and congratulations for  the really great work that they’ve done.

But the problem is that they remain those, as the Minister indicated, that will try to  test our resolve and our capability, but we are ready.

The Australian Government is able to call upon an unprecedented capability in terms  of its maritime response and surveillance capabilities both at sea and in the air. And  we will intend, or we do intend to keep using them, to ensure that our borders remain  safe, that the people smugglers are put out of business and importantly we lose no  more lives at sea. We remain fixed on this requirement and we will continue to see it  through to the end.

So on that point though, I would just finish off by saying of course we would not be  able to put all of those great capabilities into effect without the work of the men and  women across all of those agencies that I mentioned before from the uniform  members of the Australian Border Force and the Australian Defence Force right  through to the civilians in our public servants who do really critical work behind the  scenes to continue to make sure that our borders remain safe and the scourge of  people smuggling is removed from our region. Thank you.

PETER DUTTON:

Ok. Are there any questions?

JOURNALIST:

The US has conducted a missile attack in Syria. Can Australia increase its military  response as part of the US…..[inaudible]……

PETER DUTTON:

Well look, my understanding is that the Prime Minister’s receiving briefings obviously  in relation to this matter and no doubt the Defence Minister as well and I’ll leave  comment for the Prime Minister and or the Defence Minister to make.

But we have been partners, allies with the United States, with the United Kingdom  and others for a long period of time and we’ve supported operations. We’ve provided  support both on the frontline and within headquarters behind the scenes intelligence  gathering - all the rest of it for a long period of time.

But what all of us would want is to make sure that people, particularly in Syria, who  have gone through a civil conflict, to have that civil conflict to come to an end and for  people to be able to return to their homeland to rebuild and to return to the lives that  they once had.

So I’ll leave any comment in relation to the operational matters to the Prime Minister  or the Defence Minister.

JOURNALIST:

Just on that, has the National Security Committee of Cabinet met or will it meet to  discuss any enhanced Australian…..[inaudible]…….

PETER DUTTON:

Well, as I say, I’ll leave any of that to the Prime Minister.

JOURNALIST:



Do you expect this to cause a new wave of refugees?

PETER DUTTON:

We know that in Syria already there were six and a half million people who have  been displaced by the civil conflict and we know that the situation deteriorates when  people are experiencing the sort of outcomes from chemical weapons or attacks on  human beings which is completely unacceptable.

And in terms of the detail of the operation, as I say, that’s for the Prime Minister and  others to comment on once they have had appropriate briefings, but I don’t have  anything to add to that.

JOURNALIST:

……[inaudible]……

PETER DUTTON:

Again, I just don’t have anything to add to it.

JOURNALIST:

Just on the GST, WA’s economy is the worst it’s been since the Great Depression  according to the Premier. Does the Federal Government have a responsibility to help  the state?

PETER DUTTON:

Well in terms of GST arrangements and financial arrangements between any of the  States and the Commonwealth, that’s an issue for the Treasurer, so any of those  questions are best directed to the Treasurer.

JOURNALIST:

Do you think it’s fair though that WA receives 34 cents in the dollar when other states  get in excess…….[inaudible]…..

PETER DUTTON:

…well as I say, I mean they are issues - economic matters are issues for the  Treasurer.

If there are any questions about Immigration or border protection then I’m happy to  take those.

JOURNALIST:



Just on polling.  A member…..[inaudible]……

PETER DUTTON:

Well again, in terms of economic matters I think the Treasurer and others are best  placed to comment on those.

One of the things I know is very important to Western Australians is that fact that we  keep our border secure. Not too far from the west coast we are dealing with the  scourge of people smugglers, with illegal fishers and the fact that we are making a  record investment into border protection has resulted in increased detections of  illegal fishers.

It has increased the number of detentions of people smuggling ventures. It’s meant,  as a result, that we haven’t had any drownings at sea since Operation Sovereign  Borders commenced, but as I have pointed out - the threat still remains.

We still have people smugglers trying to take money off innocent men, women and  children putting them onto vessels to send them to our country and that’s not  acceptable and the Government’s resolve is absolutely resolute.

In terms of my responsibilities around border protection, around immigration, around  national security - I think the residents, the people of Western Australia, can be  assured of the fact that this Government is doing the very best and will continue to  do that

JOURNALIST:

Do you think the Medicare scare cost the Liberals up to six seats at the last Federal  election?

PETER DUTTON:

Well, in terms of the review by Andrew Robb, I'll leave others to discuss that.

Obviously it's an issue that's being contemplated by the Federal Executive, and  that's an issue for them. I haven't seen the report.

I can tell you from my own seat, I had women in their eighties coming up to me in  pre-polling in tears because they had been harangued by union thugs on the  telephone overnight, telling them that Medicare was going to be privatised, it was  going to be sold off, that the services wouldn't be provided to them.

Well, the election was last July; we are investing more in Medicare every day. Bulk  billing rates are up, we are putting more into public hospitals, more into the Medicare  system, the health system in general. So it demonstrates the lies that were  perpetrated at the time by Labor, by GetUp, by the unions, because they were  scaring people. But I think we've demonstrated since that time, since the July  election, that of course none of that has come to fruition and that's why I think people  should apply a huge level of scrutiny to anything Bill Shorten says, because clearly  he's not a person that can be trusted.

JOURNALIST:

There was a murder in Queanbeyan in New South Wales overnight. Is there any  suggestion that that was terrorism….[inaudible]…..

PETER DUTTON:

I don't have any information in relation to a murder in Queanbeyan. That's an issue  for the ACT Police and I just suggest you should contact them.

JOURNALIST:

Do you think that Tony Abbott played a negative role for the Liberal Party at the last  election?

PETER DUTTON:

Well, as I say, I haven't read the report. The report is being provided to the Federal  Executive today; it's been undertaken by Andrew Robb.

All of us share our responsibility in relation to election wins, election losses, seat  wins, seat losses. In the end, though, what we're absolutely united in doing is  defeating Bill Shorten at the next election, because if the CFMEU get in control of the  Treasury benches that will be a disaster for families and small businesses across the  country.

We have delivered a tax cut which is going to be a benefit to small business, so that  they can employ more apprentices and more local staff in plants across the country  that would rely on work being subcontracted out from a company like Austal here.

That's what our Government is doing. We are getting on with supporting families,  supporting business, growing jobs.

We are doing a lot of work in the energy space, to the credit of the Prime Minister  and Josh Frydenberg and others sitting around the Cabinet table.

And I think people should look at the claims being made by Bill Shorten and others,  because at the moment Bill Shorten is the master of the scare campaign but, as they  demonstrated when they were in government, Labor has no ability to deliver for  families.

They ramped up debt; we are dealing with the consequences and the hangover of  Labor's debt even today, and we will be for many years to come.

JOURNALIST:

Nationals MP Kevin Hogan has called for foreign aid to be redirected to flood-affected communities…. [inaudible]…...

PETER DUTTON:

www.minister.border.gov.au

Well again, I mean, foreign aid is an issue for the Foreign Minister to comment on.

We are providing record amounts of money to local communities, and we will do that  across the country. I know the Justice Minister, Michael Keenan, has been involved  in briefings every day in relation to floods and natural disasters, and obviously the  Commonwealth plays its roll along with the local and state authorities to try and  restore what has been damaged, to try and mitigate flood damage in particular from  reoccurring.

As we've seen in Rockhampton, our investments in the road network up there has  meant that a section of the Bruce Highway that was flooded previously won't be  flooded this time. So there's a lot of work that's already underway and no doubt that'll  continue.

JOURNALIST:

Just on the vessel that was returned this month, when can you say any more details  as to when and where that happened?

PETER DUTTON:

No, I don't have any more details to provide in relation to the vessel. Twenty-five Sri  Lankan nationals were returned to Sri Lanka. The vessel has returned - or the  people were returned in March, and that's the only detail that I can provide you at  this time.

Alright, thanks very much.
