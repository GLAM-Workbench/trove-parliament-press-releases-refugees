* a boost to public housing rental stock  and associated community services; and

* genuine tax cuts and associated measures  aimed at making up the decline in family  living standards.

A Budget deficit could be financed by a net  addition to money supply financed by Treasury bills  bought by the Reserve Bank. Pressure on interest  rates should be eased by devaluation of the dollar

and a temporary overseas borrowing program. The  employment program is designed to create directly  about 150,000 job opportunities. Our public  housing program would involve spending an extra

$170 million. Our proposal for a genuine increase  in family living standards - through tax reform,  for instance; cheaper health insurance and a new  improved retirement scheme - would directly  bolster consumer spending.

With such a program we will make Australia once  again a prosperous and fair place to live. We owe  it to those who have worked so hard before us and  those who are coming after us - to those  Australians who came here from many parts of the  world to make this country what it was, is, and

can be again.

”IN OTHER WORDS” From M IC K  YOUNG m  p. Shadow Minister for Immigration  and Ethnic Affairs

No. 5, August 1982

SPECIAL BUDGET EDITION

Editorial Ã¢ÂÂ

The 1982-83 Budget is somewhat more generous to  pensioners, beneficiaries, students, and low  income earners than the past six Fraser Budgets.  On closer examination, however, it becomes

clear that benefits and concessions are spread  thinly and could soon be overtaken by rises in  the cost of living. The proposed expenditure  for migrant services is no exception to this.

The overall impact of this Budget can be put  quite simply: the increased taxes to raise  necessary revenue will push up inflation so  that we could have an inflation rate of 11% to

12%. This, in turn, will push up the interest  rates , and subsequently cause even greater  unemployment (now predicted to rise to 10%, or  680,000 registered unemployed).

2

In fact, the most insidious statement in the  Treasurer's (Mr Howard) Budget speech,  in my view,  is that there is no likely growth in employment. In fact, the Government admitted that, with no

growth in employment and a continually growing  labour force, unemployment will increase even  further.

The Minister for Employment and Industrial  Relations (Mr Macphee) foreshadowed that 8% of  the workforce will be unemployed in February 1983,  but most experts, including the Secretary to the  Minister's Department,  are expecting the unemployÂ­ ment rate to be closer to 101 by that time.  If

unemployment was to be kept down to the current  level of 6.51 (or even to the Government's  projected 81) ,  some 120,000 to 130,000 jobs would  need to be created over the next twelve months.   Yet, on Budget night the Government categorically

stated that there would be no job-creation.

Not one new job will be created in the Australian  economy - that is the message of the Government  that has always advertised itself as a Government  of sound economic management, that has won  elections on a promise of work for everyone who  wants it! What this Government has achieved is

that Australia now has the highest interest rate,   the highest unemployment rate, and almost the  highest inflation rate of its history.

This economic mismanagement, of course,  casts a  shadow over the Government's immigration program.  Of the approximately 441 of new settlers who  entered the Australian workforce last year,

about 201 were looking for jobs in the semiÂ­ skilled and unskilled categories. These  categories,  according to the Department of

Employment and Industrial Relations, are in overÂ­ supply in every Australian state.  Therefore,  I  am convinced that a thorough investigation of the

7

services for migrant  communities. Apart from  the Galbally Evaluation,  we have seen little conÂ­

structive productivity  from this Institute,  which also appears to be  extremely reluctant to

disclose to the public  how it actually spends  its allocation of public  moneys.

Assisted Passages

Assisted passages are  another traditional area  associated with the immiÂ­ gration program which has  been subjected to a

"Razor Gang" recommendaÂ­ tion. They are now only  available to refugees and  special humanitarian  cases. Therefore,  the  Government was able to  reduce expenditure in this  area:  a saving of $4.3  million is envisaged by

this year's Budget.

* * * * * * *

In conclusion I would like to elaborate briefly on  Labor's reactions to the Budget as a whole, and put  forward some alternative plans for improving  Australia's current economic malaise, as outlined

in the Budget Speech by the Leader of the  Opposition, Mr Bill Hayden, on 24 August.

In the short term, Labor would aim at a prudent  level of expansion in the economy. It would  include:

* an employment policy that would directly  boost job opportunities by about 15,0000  in the public and private sectors;

* increased spending on capital works on  overdue social and economic infrastructure  programs, in co-operation with state and  local government;

main-stream further  education, they are angry  at not having been  consulted prior to the  Minister’s decision

affecting this (apparentÂ­ ly, the TAPE Council was  informed one hour before

the Minister's announceÂ­ ment) , and that no  adequate funds have been  made available. Instead

of providing funds, the  Government expects TAPE  to extract $1.5 million  this year and $1.8  million next year from

its "quality improvement"  program - the only TAPE  program presently funded  by the Commonwealth. The Government has thus

created a climate of  hostility which ultimateÂ­ ly will be to the disÂ­ advantage of migrant  students.

Grants-in-Aid

Grants-in-Aid is the  only DIEA service area  that has received a  significant increase:

from $1.8 million to $3.3  million, or 85%. With  the increase come plans  for the restructuring of

the whole scheme, as  proposed in the AIMA

Evaluation. How effectÂ­ ive this will be remains  to be seen, but Grant-in  -Aid workers are already  concerned that their

gains will be eroded by  inflation within six  months.

I will comment on the  Grant-in-Aid reform in  more detail at a later  date.

Australian Institute of  Multicultural Affairs

The Minister for Immi- Â· Ã¢ÂÂ   -   gration and Ethnic  Affairs, in his postÂ­ budget press release,

announced increased  funding for AIMA of $3.8  million. $1.5 million  of this appears to be

for real estate  (permanent accommodation  on land to be provided  by the Victorian  Government).

This would underline  once again the GovernÂ­ ment’s preoccupation  with publicising its  commitment to multi-

culturalism rather than  concentrating on proÂ­ viding adequate, let  alone high-standard

3

impact of immigration on the labour market is  urgently required.

What makes matters even worse, is that up to 100.000 jobs in Australia could be taken up  illegally or unnecessarily by persons without  residence status. Visitors legally in Australia,  but working illegally, are estimated to number

25.000 to 30,000; persons who are in Australia  illegally and must be suspected of working to  support themselves amount to about 40,000 to 50,000;  persons in Australia, working legally on temporary  working visas for multinational corporations, many

of whom could be replaced by Australian residents,  are estimated to number about 5,000 to 10,000; and  working holiday-makers, some of whom misuse the  program as "disguised immigration", about 16,000.  Although precise details are difficult to obtain, a

greater effort should surely be made to tighten up  on this.

The people of Australia, whether they were born  here or overseas, will not support an immigration  program which, as it appears from the Government's  statements, will only contribute to the rapidly

growing dole queues. This is by no means an antiÂ­ migrant sentiment - unemployment affects everyone,  it hits especially hard those new arrivals who are

semi-skilled or unskilled. Therefore, I will conÂ­ tinue to press for the establishment of a  Parliamentary Committee to investigate the enormous  questions concerning the economic impact and labour  market implications of immigration. To find

answers to these questions and solutions to the  present unemployment problem is in the interests of  all Australians, whether they are overseas or  Australian born.

BUDGET IMPLICATIONS FOR MIGRANT SERVICES

In his post-budget press release, the Minister for  Immigration and Ethnic Affairs stated that  "Migrant Service Levels Have Been Maintained". In  the wake of the Government's ready acceptance of  the Galbally Report and the more recent Evaluation  of the Report by the Australian Institute of  Multicultural Affairs (AIMA), as well as the

fanfare that has accompanied this, one could have  expected levels of expenditure for migrant  services to substantially increase. However, the

Government admits to having only "maintained"  levels. What it does not admit is that, in most  cases, the Budget does not even allow for  maintenance of levels, because if one takes

inflation into account, one finds that many of  the services have actually been cut back in real  terms:

Departmental Expenditure

The overall Budget for  the Department of ImmiÂ­ gration and Ethnic  Affairs for 1982/83 is

S116 million, compared to  S110 million in 1981/82.  This represents an inÂ­ crease of 5.71, but when  a 10.1% inflation rate is  taken into account, this  amounts to a cut of 5% in  .real terms.

Over 80 recommendations  of the AIMA Evaluation of  the Galbally Report have  been accepted by the

Government,  which has  made considerable

political mileage out of  making these promises,  but has given little  priority in this year's

Budget to their  implementation.

Migrant Resource Centres

Migrant Resource Centres  appear to have been  particularly punished by  this Budget. In line  with the Galbally

Evaluation by AIMA, the  Government decided that  many tasks presently  carried out by the  Department (or Migrant  Settlement Centres run

5

by the Department but now  being phased out), are to  be transferred to Migrant  Resource Centres. The  positions thus saved are  presumably intended to

contribute to cutting  Department expenditure.  Yet, according to this  Budget, no additional

resources are made availÂ­ able to Migrant Resource  Centres, which have been  financially overÂ­

stretched for some time.

The increase in assistÂ­ ance to the Centres  amounts to 5.11. Again,  in real terms, this  represents a cut of about  51.

Adult Migrant Education

Part of the Adult Migrant  Education program  (advanced courses) is to  be off-loaded on to the  technical and further  education institutions.  That leaves the admini- ,

stration of three Â· .

programs with DIEA: the  on-arrival, the on-going,  and the administration  and support services

programs. For these,  $34.2 million have been

earmarked, representing  a $2 million, or 6.11,  increase over the  previous year. There has  been a lot of posturing Â·   about this increase, but  again it hardly keeps up  with the erosion of funds  by inflation.

AME teachers are not  happy about the fact that,   although more classes are  planned, savings are

going to be made at the  expense of good teaching:  it is planned that the  student-staff ratio will  be increased from 15:1 to

20:1 .

Furthermore, the GovernÂ­ ment does not appear to  be taking steps to  improve AME teachers'   working conditions.

Consequently, casual  teachers working fullÂ­ time will continue to  subsidise the Adult  Migrant Education Service.

Similarly, TAPE employees  are not too pleased with  the manner in which  responsibility for the  advanced classes has been  transferred to them. '

Whilst supporting, in  principle, that such  classes should be part of
