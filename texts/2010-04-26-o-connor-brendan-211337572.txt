The Australian Government changed the asylum seeker processing system, effective 9 April  2010, and suspended the processing of claims for Sri Lankan and Afghan nationals for at  least three and six months respectively as situations in both countries are evolving.

The Australian Government remains committed to protecting the Australian border from  maritime threats, including people smuggling, and as a result, has committed more than $654  million to implement a comprehensive people smuggling strategy to combat this issue with  an expanded presence in the region by the Australian Federal Police, the Department of

Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Department of Immigration and Citizenship and the Australian  Customs and Border Protection Service.

People smugglers seek out and exploit vulnerable persons who, having faced uncertainty,  conflict and violence, pursue stability and safety.

People who are owed Australia’s protection under our international obligations will be  granted that protection. Those who seek to exploit and put lives at risk through people  smuggling will face the full consequence of the law.

Since September 2008, the AFP has charged 135 people with offences under the Migration  Act 1958 (Cth). These offences attract a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment.
