ON THE OCCASION OF

GOVERNMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA

20 JUNE 2006

Ã¢ÂÂ¢   The Right Honourable Ian Sinclair, President, Austcare       Ã¢ÂÂ¢   Major General Michael Smith, Chief Executive Officer       Ã¢ÂÂ¢   The Honourable Justice John Dowd and the Honourable Justice Marcus Einfeld, Austcare  Ambassadors       Ã¢ÂÂ¢   Sponsors and Supporters of Austcare       Ã¢ÂÂ¢   Paul Cullen Humanitarian Awardees       Ã¢ÂÂ¢   Ladies and gentlemen

Good evening everyone. Marlena and I are delighted to welcome you all to Government House.     I am honoured to have presented the Paul Cullen Humanitarian Awards, and I heartily commend  Australian Aid International, Ibasi Ohinde and Father Chris Riley for their truly inspiring work.      In his absence may I acknowledge Major General Paul Cullen who has been no mere observer of life.  Quite the contrary; he has always been a man of great physical and moral courage, strong views and  tremendous energy; and as I am sure those who know him will agree, once he has an idea, he's a hard  man to shake. In this 39th year since the founding of Austcare, I acknowledge Paul's pivotal role in the  organisation's formation and development.     Internationally, large scale conflict between nations, the tragedy of oppression and violence within  national boundaries would, I hope sharpen our minds to the good fortune we enjoy as Australians in a  society blessed by peace. Being surrounded by water also tends to isolate us from some of the world's  harsher realities.     Nevertheless we cannot ignore the tragic fact that we live in a world where in excess of 33 million  people are refugees, stateless or displaced.     Indeed the sheer magnitude of the situation is brought into focus when we realise that one in every 197  people out of a global population of 6.5 billion has been forced into flight to escape persecution,  political unrest, war, tribal jealousies, disease and starvation.     In this context it is useful to review several of the objectives of Austcare which are:        Ã¢ÂÂ¢   To create an awareness about the issues, circumstances and needs of refugees;       Ã¢ÂÂ¢   To provide aid and protection in humanitarian emergencies where displacement occurs;       Ã¢ÂÂ¢   To assist the integration of refugees returning home; and       Ã¢ÂÂ¢   To lobby communities, sponsors, governments and others about humanitarian principles.

How does Austcare achieve its objectives? Some of its current activities include:        Ã¢ÂÂ¢   Deploying Australian protection officers to UN agencies in refugee and internal displaced situations  of dire humanitarian need, including the Sudan, Pakistan, East Timor and Kenya;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢   Working in the Palestinian Territories to establish neighbourhood centres to help women establish

small businesses and to encourage the potential of young people through leadership training programs;       Ã¢ÂÂ¢   Delivering humanitarian and development projects in East Timor including medical care and peace  building programs; and       Ã¢ÂÂ¢   Working in Aceh, Indonesia to help people displaced by the Tsunami to rebuild their lives and their  livelihoods, assisting survivors of the recent earthquake especially through humanitarian relief for  women and children and in the construction of temporary shelters.

But as you all know, much more remains to be done.     One of the great challenges facing all non-government, charitable organisations is the quest for funds. It  is never easy to convince people to part with their hard-earned cash, no matter how deserving the cause.     The words of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees could have been written about the  values and work of Austcare, and are a timely reminder to all of us especially during Refugee Week:  "Refugees are not a threat - they are threatened. They are not a burden on society - they carry society's  burden."     And the burden is all too often, long term; and refugees are some of the most excluded of the world's  poor. Indeed they tend to come from the poorest, least developed nations in the world. And what of the  potential of young lives? As a teacher of children in a refugee camp has noted: "in the thirteen years we  have been here, the children could have grown up to become doctors and lawyers, but all they've done  is sit here in the dust. It is such a waste."     Thank you all for your generous support of Austcare. We cannot hope to help every refugee in the world  - no single organisation can do that - but we can make a difference to the lives of many refugees, by  continuing to give to this most worthy of causes.     Well done Austcare and well done its supporters.     Thank you.
