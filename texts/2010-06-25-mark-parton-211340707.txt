TRANSCRIPT OF SENATOR GARY HUMPHRIES INTERVIEW WITH MARK  PARTON, RADIO 2CC CANBERRA

E&OE…………………………………………………………………

Issues: Labor Leadership

MARK PARTON:

We’ve got Gary Humphries on the line. We’ve just been speaking to Roy, Gary, all of a  sudden he’s thinking of going back to Labor because Julia Gillard’s on board does that worry  you?

GARY HUMPHRIES:

Look, it doesn’t surprise me, I’m sure a lot of people will be relieved that Kevin Rudd has  gone, and they’ll say to themselves ‘it’s safe to go back to Labor’.  But the problem with that,  Mark, is that we haven’t seen yet any clear sign of any change in the policies that brought  Labor to its knees.  I don’t think Kevin Rudd was the problem, I think it was the Labor  Government’s policies and approach to all sorts of issues, its failure to keep its promises and  its failure to manage money, and its failures to indicate to the Australian people where it was  going - that was what caused the problem, and changing from Rudd to Gillard won’t alter  that basic reality unless Julia Gillard can introduce fairly major changes in their policies.

MARK PARTON:

Look, I think a lot of what you’re saying is true and correct, but I think those problems are  exacerbated ten-fold by the communications style of Kevin Rudd.  And I know that there are  certain aspects of the way that Julia Gillard delivers messages that are going to grate on  people, but it’s particularly on the basis on her performance yesterday - that was a stunning  first day Gary.  She was sensational in that speech yesterday, you’ve got to agree with me.

GARY HUMPHRIES:

And it reminded me a lot actually about what a great impression Kevin Rudd was making,  particularly in those first few weeks and months after he was elected Labor leader in 2006.

MARK PARTON:

Mate, I never thought that.  I never ever thought that.  I declared back at the time he took on  Kim Beazley that the man has no personality whatsoever and was a Labor insect, he was the  worst person I could think of to run the country.  Julia impresses me.  I’m sorry to say from  your perspective Gary, Julia impresses me.  It’s my belief, that the election was decided  yesterday.  Obviously there’s some water to pass under the bridge.  I mean, when do you  think this poll’s going to be Gary?

GARY HUMPHRIES:

Well, look it’s very hard to say Mark.  There are rumours flying around Parliament House  that it’s going to be any day now because she wants to run in quickly.  Others are saying  she’ll wait until she’s got a good grip on what’s going on, and it’s just impossible to say and I  wouldn’t speculate.  But I will say that I think she needs to do not so much of a makeover job  and a refashioning of the face of the Government, as a refashioning of the substance of the  Government.  That’s the only thing I believe will save the Labor Party.  Because its policy  settings are so fundamentally wrong.  I mean, Julia Gillard was responsible for the Building  the School Hall rip-off program, she was responsible in part for the program to deliver the  insulation debacle, she was there when the decision was made about changing the boat  policy, I mean all the issues that have led the Labor Party to such a disastrous state were there  on Julia Gillard’s desk as much as Kevin Rudd’s and the other members of the ‘Gang of  Four’.

MARK PARTON:

So much of the Coalition’s approach to this upcoming election was going to be to kick the  Government where it hurt the most.  So kick them in the Niagaras, which really was Kevin  Rudd, he was the weakest spot. If this was a cricket match, they’ve put a box in now, and you  can’t really kick them there, how does this change things in terms of the Coalition approach.

GARY HUMPHRIES:

Look, I have to say to you, I really think that what caused the turnaround in Kevin Rudd’s  fortune in the last six months was not some sudden realisation on the part of the Australian  people that this man was not a good Prime Minister, although that was a part of the process.   What turned around the Australian people was the failure of the Government’s policies.   That’s what made people realise that something was wrong.  When they saw boat after boat  arriving, when they saw people being killed in a bungled insulation program, when they saw  extraordinary waste of money in the school hall program, that’s what made people change

their mind about Labor, not the personality of Kevin Rudd.  So that’s what Julia Gillard will  have to change if she has any hope of being able to turn Labor’s fortunes around at the  election that’s coming up.

MARK PARTON:

In closing Gary, one of our listeners has asked whether Kevin Rudd’s going to be paying  market rent at The Lodge, we’re wondering what that market rent would be.  Matt’s just  suggested that it should be $3,000 a week!

GARY HUMPHRIES:

Well I don’t know what Julia Gillard’s intentions are with that, but I think she’s obviously  playing it very close to her chest if she’s not yet moving in there.

MARK PARTON:

I think it’s fair enough.  She hasn’t been voted in by the people, we know there’s an election  that’s close.  You know, I don’t think it’s a bad thing for her not to move in, I just hope Kevin  Rudd doesn’t bulldoze the place and build townhouses!

GARY HUMPHRIES:

Well I’m sure Jon Stanhope would say ‘yes he can do that’ if he asked!

MARK PARTON:

Gary, we gotta go, thanks for your time!
