E&OE TRANSCRIPT  TELEVISION INTERVIEW  SKY NEWS SATURDAY AGENDA  SATURDAY, 21 NOVEMBER 2015

SUBJECT/S: Syrian Refugees, Concerns over Darwin Port, S Kidman & Co  Split, Boat Arrival, Tony Abbott.

LAURA JAYES: Matt Thistlethwaite thanks for your time I want to ask you about this  story in the Australian Newspaper this morning perhaps suggesting that the  Government might look at taking in the intake of refugees more Christians, Jews and  Yazidis, is this something Labor would support?

MATT THISTLETHWAITE, SHADOW PARLIAMENTARY SECRETARY FOR  IMMIGRATION & FOREIGN AFFAIRS: Well Laura Australia operates a non-discriminatory humanitarian refugee intake and that derives from our Constitution  and really what we do as a nation is we take the advice of the United Nations High  Commission for Refugees on where there is the greatest need and the greatest  urgency in respect of those who are fleeing Syria, so it may be the case that there  will be quite a few Christians who are taken by the Australian Government, but that  has nothing to do with their religious background, it has everything to do with  urgency and need and the advice of the United Nations High Commission for  Refugees.

JAYES: But do you think after the events in Paris it really has injected some kind of  suspicion into the Australian community because we did see one of those attackers  apparently made his way through Greece and there has been some arguing from the  fringes perhaps that perhaps there should be more moderate groups like Christians,  Yazidis and the Jews so do you think there is a bit of a change in the Australian  psyche in the last week?

THISTLETHWAITE: Australians should have every confidence that our intelligence  agencies, the Australian Federal Police, our Department of Immigration and Border  Protection staff do a fine job in assessing these applications, and we also as I said  earlier work with the UNHCR so there’s a preliminary process that they will go  through of security, health, and background checks, it’s then done again by Australia  and it’s one of the most thorough checks anywhere in the world so Australians  should have every confidence that every possible check and balance is made before  the decision is made to bring a refugee to Australia.

JAYES: Can I ask you about the Port of Darwin now, is Labor critical about the  outcome or just the process?

THISTLETHWAITE: Well we’re certainly critical of the process, it’s an  embarrassment to have the President of the United States raise this with our Prime  Minister and we’ve asked for the background to how this decision was made, we  want greater transparency, we want to be clear about how a decision like this on a  very important strategic asset could be made in this manner and importantly what  intelligence there was in respect of the company that leased the operation and  whether or not our important alliance partner the US was informed.

JAYES: Is FIRB the appropriate body to oversee such a sale in future, it didn’t  oversee this, but down the track is that what you’d like to see or a separate body  altogether?

THISTLETHWAITE: Well FIRB certainly has an expertise in assessing these sort of  applications, it’s what it does on a daily basis, and we want to see and we want to  know just what processes the Government put in place and indeed Laura whether or  not the leadership change and the change in Treasurer’s has had any effect on this  decision? Is it the case that Scott Morrison dropped the ball on this because his mind  was otherwise occupied because he’d just become the new Treasurer? These are all  the issues I think the Australian Government needs to explain to the Australian  public.

JAYES: I know Labor is pushing for perhaps a Senate Inquiry is likely to get up but  also as a second part to my question, FIRB doesn’t oversee national security so do  we need a special national security test in place for such assets?

THISTLETHWAITE: Well we are calling for a Senate Inquiry because we do believe  that this decision does need to be reviewed and the Australian people have to have  every confidence that in the future strategic assets such as this will get important  scrutiny prior to any lease or sale but there is room for the Treasurer to ask the FIRB  to become involved even though the triggers may not be met in terms of the  legislation, there’s nothing stopping the Treasurer asking the FIRB to become  involved and we’ve seen that in NSW with the sale of electricity assets so when  you’re talking about important strategic assets such as this it’s not beyond the realm  for the Treasurer to ask the body that has the expertise in reviewing these sorts of  decisions to have a look at it.

JAYES: Does it strike you as passing strange perhaps that in the same week Scott  Morrison also blocked the sale of the Kidman Property, this is a decision that Andrew  Robb this morning in the papers has branded as political?

THISTLETHWAITE: Well it’s clear there’s some division in the leadership of the  Government in the Liberal Party on this issue, Andrew Robb was clearly having a  shot at the decision that’s been made by Scott Morrison, Labor’s been very clear we  support foreign investment and it’s particularly important in the agricultural industry  so again the Government needs to disclose and explain to the Australian people  whether or not the embarrassment in respect of the Port of Darwin did effect the  Treasurer making this decision to reject the sale of the Kidman Properties.

JAYES: Just a few other stories as well this asylum seeker vessel that’s come within  200m of Christmas Island apparently still from the Government it’s an on water  matter so no further details but I think there are renewed calls for at least the  Government to tell us about the fate of those on board because there’s anecdotal  evidence that this boat was being dragged back out to sea.

THISTLETHWAITE: That’s right there’s evidence from people living on Christmas  Island that the boat got within literally hundreds of metres of the wharf so the  Government does need to explain where the boat was sent to and the fate of those  that were on the boat and whether or not the Government has met international  commitments that Australia is a signatory to through the United Nations High  Commission for Refugees, and whether or not proper assessment had taken place in  Australian waters of those that may be on that boat.

JAYES: And Matt if I could just finally ask you about Tony Abbott and his  intervention and well public comments on national security this week after the Paris  attacks, do you think his views are helpful, Malcolm Turnbull didn’t seem to be  bothered by them but you know he is a former Prime Minister he does have some  standing in the community, were his comments welcomed?

THISTLETHWAITE: Well it appears Tony Abbott’s not going anywhere and he’s  going to be a thorn in the side for the new Prime Minister, what’s important I think in  this respect Laura is that he’s chosen to do this on national security so you’ve  potentially got a Government that’s divided on a very, very important issue and I  think that Australians want to see that their Government is united and at one on  national security and Labor’s over the course of the last couple of years importantly  offered bipartisan support to the Government on a number of measures that have  strengthened our national security legislation because we understand the importance  of it for the safety of Australians so on issues such as this we want to see a  Government that’s united not divided and it appears that there is some division that’s  beginning to enter the Government on this issue.

JAYES: It’s interesting to see as Tony Abbott’s intervention, I put this to Scott Ryan  as well, do you think with this intervention Tony Abbott not really wanting to go out of  the media spotlight do you think this is a sign that perhaps he’ll stay in Parliament

and from the party who had Kevin Rudd and who Kevin Rudd stayed on the back  bench, we all know what happened then, would you perhaps advise against it?

THISTLETHWAITE: Well there’s no doubt that was a period of instability for the  Labor Party and we suffered because of that. What’s important from our perspective  is that we learn lessons and we reformed a number of our processes. It appears that  Tony Abbott’s not going anywhere, there’s potential for instability and I think that the  Australian public particularly on national security want to see unity in their  government. So the Government needs to get their act together I think.

JAYES: We’ll see, Matt Thistlethwaite as always thanks for your time.
