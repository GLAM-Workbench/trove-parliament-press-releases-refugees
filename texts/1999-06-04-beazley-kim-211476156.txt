JOURNALIST:

Â

...the events in Yugoslavia might change the prospects 
for the Care Australia workers?

Â

BEAZLEY:

Â

That must increase the hopes. Firstly, it does seem 
to be the case that the war may be winding down and a solution reached 
- the solution that takes the refugees home. If that is so, that is 
terrific news. You’d also have to say that all the political points 
- though I can’t see that there are any - but the Yugoslav Government 
may feel they’re making by keeping our people In captivity like this, 
must also disappear with the war, So, you’d have to be hopeful now, 
I think, that this may come to a good conclusion. But we’re not there 
yet.

Â

JOURNALIST:

Â

How important do you think this service is, given 
the events that we’ve had in the last 24 hours?

Â

BEAZLEY:

Â

Look, I think it’s terribly important that when 
there is concern, when you have concern for your people, be it after 
national tragedies, be it in circumstances like this, I think it’s 
a good thing for the nation to come together and focus prayerfully on 
it. I would think that because that happens to be my beliefs, But there 
are a lot of people who don’t hold my beliefs who also, I think, find 
it appropriate that there is some sort of national getting together 
to think about it and to express a view. And I think this church service 
is helpful in that way.

Â

Ends.
