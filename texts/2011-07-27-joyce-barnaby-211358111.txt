27 July 2011

TRANSCRIPT OF THE HON. TONY ABBOTT MHR   JOINT DOORSTOP INTERVIEW WITH SENATOR BARNABY JOYCE,   SHADOW MINISTER FOR REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT, LOCAL  GOVERNMENT AND WATER,

TAMWORTH

Subject: Julia Gillard’s carbon tax.

E&OE……………………….……………………………………………………………

TONY ABBOTT:

It’s nice to be here at Belmore Engineering. I want to thank David Green and Mitch and the team for making  Barnaby and me so welcome. This is one of the tens of thousands of businesses right around Australia which  is going to be impacted by the carbon tax because all of the major inputs here - the power, the fuel, the steel  - are going to go up in price as a result of the carbon tax. Now, I want to make it easier for business, not  harder for business. I think that the message from business to the Government is loud and clear: this tax is  toxic; we have enough difficulties as it is without you making our life harder with this toxic tax.

The other point to make is that the best way to save Australia from this toxic tax is for one member of  parliament who is currently intending to vote for it to change his or her mind and I think the message that’s  coming from the electorate of New England pretty loud and clear is that they don’t like this carbon tax  either. So, I hope the local member is listening. I hope the local members in steel seats, in coal seats, in  manufacturing seats are all listening to their people because I think the people are saying ‘we need this like  we need a hole in the head.’ It’s a toxic tax and I say to the Prime Minister, no wonder you’ve stopped your  shoe leather tour because the message that I’ve been getting as I wear out my shoe leather is that this tax is  toxic, the people don’t like it. What they’re saying to me and what I presume they’re saying to the Prime  Minister, those of them that are lucky enough to get her ear, is no tax collection without an election.

Barnaby, do you want to say a few words?

BARNABY JOYCE:

Thanks for that Tony and thank you very much for coming out here today. It’s great to go in and talk to the  guys and see people who enjoy their job in life of making things, creating things, being constructive. Making  steel purlins and trusses so that you can stick them together and call them a shed, that’s what Australians are  like. They get a thrill out of being positive people. It blows their hair back to actually make things, or blows  what’s left of their hair back, or for me, not much at all and for you Tony, even less.

But what this tax does, it’s just such a negative outcome. It just says to people: if you’re inspired by making  things, we’re going to try and take that right away from you. The Labor Party and the Greens, everything  they do, I’ve just got back Tasmania back to Tamworth - and I grew up around here - and everything they  touch is about -it’s negative, it’s shutting things down, it’s closing things off. They’re shutting down the live  cattle trade or they’re shutting down the Murray-Darling Basin or they’re shutting down the timber industry  and now they just want to shut everything down with a carbon tax.

What Tony’s doing, what he’s leading is the most positive campaign in Australia; positive because he  actually wants to keep you in a job. He actually wants to make you build things. He wants to take our nation  to a higher level. He doesn’t think that the cure-all to everything is to shut everything down. Their campaign  is the ultimate - the Labor Party, the Greens and the independents - their campaign is nihilistic. It shuts  everything down. It’s the most negative position that our nation has ever been put into. Name me one thing  that they are taking us towards which takes our nation to a higher level. Their reasoning for everything is to  shut it down, replace it with a bureaucracy and create an excuse. That is the Labor Party and the Greens and  the independents. This bloke is the one who’s actually really trying to keep the show going.

TONY ABBOTT:

Ok. Thank you so much, Barnaby. Alright, just a few brief questions?

QUESTION:

Tony, you’ve been critical of the Government’s modelling of the carbon tax. What modelling have you done  for your own direct action policy?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well we think that our direct action policy is more than capable of reducing emissions by five per cent by  2020 and so does the Prime Minister because when she wrote her secret memo for the inner Cabinet, she  said that the Government should work with the Coalition to support policies around which a bipartisan  consensus should be established. So, the real Julia - to the extent that there is one - wanted to embrace  direct action. Since then she’s had two different policies, she’s had the election policy which was never ever  to have a carbon tax and since the election there’s been the policy to have a carbon tax. So, the current  policy is not real Julia but it is real Bob Brown.

QUESTION:

But what about your policy? You say you think it will work but have you done any actual modelling on it?

TONY ABBOTT:

We are very confident that by spending the $10.5 billion over a decade that we have proposed to spend that  we can get our emissions down by five per cent.

QUESTION:

Tony, Mr Windsor has said that he wants to…he’s invited you to a town hall debate over the carbon tax. Are  you interested?

TONY ABBOTT:

I’m very happy to debate the Prime Minister and if Tony Windsor can get his mate, the Prime Minister, to  come up to Tamworth I’d gladly debate the Prime Minister here in Tamworth.

QUESTION:

But not Tony?

BARNABY JOYCE:

I would love to do it tonight, the trouble is that Tony is not here. Tony is, where is he, Spain or England or  Scotland at the moment? Whereabouts is he? He’s Heathcliff-like, up in the moors, pining for Cathy.

QUESTION:

Alright, so would you be open to a debate with Mr Windsor?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, my opponent is Julia Gillard and if Tony Windsor can get Julia Gillard to come to Tamworth I will  gladly debate the Prime Minister here in Tamworth. The point I make is that the Prime Minister obviously  has given up wearing out the shoe leather because since Thursday she’s gone from Parliament House to the  National Press Club, she then went to a school on Friday, she went to Tasmania to talk forestry over the  weekend, she was back in Canberra to talk boat people on Monday, yesterday she went to Melbourne to  meet with Tony Blair. The last thing she wants to do now is get around Australia and talk about the carbon  tax because the message that she is getting loud and clear from the people is this tax is toxic. That’s why she  wants to talk about anything except the carbon tax.

QUESTION:

You’re holding a community forum tonight, why is it invitation only?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, my understanding - and Senator Williams’ office arranged it - my understanding is that hundreds if  not thousands of invitations were sent out, that’s how you get people to come to something, you send out  invitations to hundreds if not thousands of people and people are coming on a first-in best-dressed basis.

BARNABY JOYCE:

Which is better than I can say about Mr Windsor’s forum, which not only did he select the people who  came, he also selected the questions that would be asked. Yet no one seemed to pull him up on that one.

QUESTION:

Senator, can I just ask you, are you considering running against Tony Windsor now in this seat given the  sentiment you say…

BARNABY JOYCE:

I’m considering it. But that decision is not to be made because it is not to be made by me. It’s made by the  people of the electorate council. I respect the people of the New England, they will make their decision  about who they wish to run and I’m not here to do that. I suppose that’s the difference between the Windsor  approach where he will ask you for your position on gay marriage but he won’t ask you your position on  whether you want Julia Gillard as the Prime Minister. He will ask you for your position on obscure things  that don’t matter but he won’t ask for your position on the carbon tax. So, we are going to ask the people of  the New England to make their decision about who they want and I’m not going to presuppose for one

moment who they may choose.

QUESTION:

How much lobbying are you doing of council members to win this seat?

BARNABY JOYCE:

Well, that’s a question between myself and the members. I’ve obviously stated an interest and it’s up to  them, it’s up to the party structure, it’s not a decision for me. I mean, that’s…

QUESTION:

Are you the only member of the National Party who can win this seat off Tony Windsor?

BARNABY JOYCE:

No, I don’t think that’s the case at all, actually. To be honest, I think Mr Windsor has really blotted his  copybook and it’s not about so much beating Mr Windsor, it’s about getting our whole nation back on to a  path of where we’re actually doing something. We can’t go on like this, ladies and gentlemen. We cannot go  on just shutting things down, getting ourselves into massive amounts of debt, coming up with crazy,  nebulous ideas such as the carbon tax. The nation can’t go on like that otherwise we will put ourselves out of  business.

QUESTION:

Do you think you could achieve a 70 per cent primary swing off Tony Windsor or beat a tally that high?

BARNABY JOYCE:

That is a question for the people of the New England. You know, that is asking for me to be some sort of  prophet about what people are thinking at the day of the election. I don’t intend to do that, I don’t intend to  do that. I believe the right of the people on election day is they will choose who they want.

QUESTION:

The Coalition is calling for an election on this issue, so if we were, the Prime Minister were to say….

BARNABY JOYCE:

I would love to have an election on this issue. I would love…

QUESTION:

Would you be the candidate for the New England then if the election was called?

BARNABY JOYCE:

As I said, that is not my choice. It is the height of arrogance to say ‘oh well, I’m going to turn up and I deem  without talking to anybody else or giving anybody else the right to vote that I presuppose that you will all  vote for me.’ You can’t do that, you must let the people have their say and at the last state election here we  actually had a plebiscite, that is letting people express their views.

I can tell you right now it would be the worst metaphor to go forward because the people of this electorate  right now don’t want a carbon tax. The people of this electorate right now don’t want Julia Gillard and Bob  Brown running the show. To say to the people right now ‘well, I’m going to be like the problem you’ve got’  would not be a good start.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well said.
