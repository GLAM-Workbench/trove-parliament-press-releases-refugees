ABETZ WELCOMES MOVE OF KOSOVARS

TO MAKE WAY FOR EAST TIMORESE

Â

Tasmanian Liberal Senator and Tasmania Haven Cen tre Patron 
Eric Abetz today welcomed Cabinet’s decision to accommodate 1,300 
East Timorese internally displaced people at Western Australia’s Leeuwin 
Haven Centre and Victoria’s Pukapunyal Haven Centre.

Â

The 140 remaining Kosovars at Leeuwin will be relocated 
to the Tasmania Haven Centre at Brighton.

Â

“The experience and infrastructure which have been 
rallied to meet the immediate needs of the Kosovar refugees has prepared 
Australia well for the East Timor crisis,” Senator Abetz said.

Â

“The extraordinary circumstances of the last few 
months and weeks have proven the compassion and community spirit of 
the Australian people,” Senator Abetz said.

Â

“I especially acknowledge the exceptional effort 
of the staff of the Department of Defence, and the Department of Immigration 
and Multicultural Affairs and other agencies at the Tasmania Haven Centre 
who are working under difficult and ever-changing circumstances to ease 
the crisis for Kosovar refugees.

Â

“Their acceptance of more Kosovars at Brighton to 
make way for East Timorese refugees demonstrates a selfless and noble 
commitment to Australia’s key role and growing expertise in international 
humanitarian crises.”

Â

Senator Abetz is the Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister for Defence with responsibilities for Defence Estate matters.
