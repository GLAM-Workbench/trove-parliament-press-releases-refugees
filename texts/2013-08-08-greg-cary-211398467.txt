PRESENTER:

First up, the special guest, one of the major issues of course of this election campaign, now  day four, remains the issue of asylum seekers and how it relates to national sovereignty and  orderly immigration process and border protection.  To that end, I’m joined by the Shadow  Immigration Minister, the man who might be the Minister in four or five weeks from now,  Scott Morrison.  Mr Morrison, good morning.



SCOTT MORRISON:

Good morning, Greg. Great to be here at EKKA.

PRESENTER:

Welcome to the EKKA, you can have a wander around later on and get some hot dogs, and -

SCOTT MORRISON:

It’s a beautiful day, absolutely gorgeous out there so come on down.

PRESENTER:



Well you’ve got some pretty serious issues on your mind as well.  Maybe at the start there’s a  bit of confusion, since Mr Rudd came back in and since they got the Papua New Guinea thing  happening and we’re hearing about Manus and we’re hearing about Christmas Island.  If  you’re elected September 7, where will we be six months down the road and what will our  policy be to get there?

SCOTT MORRISON:

Well the policy we’ll have in place and running comprehensively at that time; we will be  turning boats back where it’s safe to do so, temporary protection visas would be a reality  once again, offshore processing on Nauru and Manus Island will be operating at a very  comprehensive level, it won’t just be something on Manus Island, it will be on both.  We will  also be having the policy that if people have thrown their documents away deliberately, they  won’t be getting refugee status in Australia, that’s our policy absolutely.  And our three star  military commander will be coordinating 15 different agencies to be driving back this people  smugglers’ trade all the way through the region, so whether it’s in Indonesia, Malaysia and  all the way up through Pakistan, working with our Federal Police, working with our  intelligence officers and others, all through the region there will be a coordinated effort to put  an end to this business and within six months, we’ll see what the ultimate result is.

PRESENTER:

Ok, if you’d like to talk to Scott Morrison, you can of course, 13 13 32 nothing changes.   We’re outside of the studio obviously but it’s a full radio set up out here so just feel free to  give us a buzz, 13 13 32.  Story front page of The Australian today, officials briefed on the  intelligence said significant numbers of Iranian Afghan asylum seekers were now delaying  their departure from their home countries and others are actively seeking to go home. Is it  possible that this PNG thing is working?

SCOTT MORRISON:

Well we’ve heard all this before.  I remember Chris Bowen, when he was Minister, he was  the second Minister, there’s been four in this portfolio since I’ve been here, he made similar  claims back after the Malaysian people swap and we all know how that ended up and we all  know that that led, and the failure of that to even higher levels of arrivals. Now I’ll give this  credit to Chris Bowen though, he didn’t go out there verballing intelligence agencies and  when he was asked about these sorts of things on intelligence back then, he said it was  inappropriate to comment on the intelligence he was given.  So, I thought that was a very  strange thing for Minister Burke to do yesterday to go out there, I can only assume selectively  quoting intelligence because that is not something that I think is a responsible thing to do. I  mean the ultimate results of these things we will see but I don’t think we’ll see one way or  the other, between now and an election.  I mean, this thing has to be assessed over months  and months and this is what I think Kevin Rudd is planning on.  He knows that the ultimate  proof of his policies will not be known on this side of the election.

PRESENTER:

You talk about the intelligence about what’s happening at Manus, where do we stand there?  We seem to be getting conflicting reports about what Prime Minister O’Neill is saying, what

the maximum number of people Manus can take and what’s likely to happen to those who are  either granted refugee status or not.

SCOTT MORRISON:

I think all of those things are very unclear.  The agreement which was signed the day before  up in PNG does not back up the big claim that the Prime Minister’s making.  It doesn’t say in  there that if you come illegally by boat to Australia, you go to PNG and you can never come  back to Australia. I mean it’s just simply not in that document. Now I have no doubt that  there can sometimes be announcement effects of things when they’re put out there into the  region but what really matters is what happens over time because when people find out  there’s a bluff or it can’t be implemented, then the trade just starts up again.  And that’s what  we saw with Malaysia, that’s what we saw with East Timor, that’s what we saw with all of  these failed arrangements in the past.  So, it really is a question of, on the other side of this  election, who do you think is the party that’s actually going to follow through and  implement? The one that had to be dragged kicking and screaming to reopen Manus Island or  the ones who have always believed in it and have had that position for over a decade.  Kevin  Rudd’s had every position on the compass on this thing.

PRESENTER:

What do you make of the government’s position now and the motivations they cite for  changing their thinking on all of this?

SCOTT MORRISON:

They have an election conscience on border protection.  They always have to be dragged  kicking and screaming on this. Kevin Rudd has had every position under the sun and that’s  why I think you can’t have great confidence about what position he will have on the other  side of an election and also the Labor Party members themselves. I mean, so many of them  have been opposed to these policies and remain opposed to these policies. They’ll keep quiet  between now until the election but on the other side, if they are re-elected, they will arc up  again. Now, we’ve had 50,000 people now turn up illegally on boats since Kevin Rudd  changed the policies that John Howard had in place.  0,000. 30,000 of them, more than that  are here in Australia today, still going through the process. 15,000 or thereabouts have  already been given permanent visas and those 30,000 are hoping for a Kevin Rudd victory  because if Kevin Rudd is re-elected at this election and they are found to be refugees, they  will get permanent visas in Australia.  That’s what the outcome will be. Under us, they  won’t.  They will get, at best, a temporary protection visa which means they don’t get family  reunion, they can’t leave the country and we will re-asses their claims down the track and if  they’re no longer refugees, they’ll go home.

PRESENTER:

Scott Morrison is our guest, if you’d like to talk to him you can.  13 13 32.  Just on that point,  can I just clarify that?  So if people attempt to get to Australia and they end up on Manus  Island but then they’re found to be genuine refugees, there’s still no chance of them getting to  Australia?  Is that fair?

SCOTT MORRISON:



Well I don’t think that’s true, that’s the problem.

PRESENTER:

Would it be true under you though?

SCOTT MORRISON:

Well what we’ve said is we will salvage from this arrangement what we can.  But we haven’t  made the big bold claim that Kevin Rudd has because we know he can’t back it up. There is  nothing in that agreement which stops PNG sending people back to Australia. There’s  nothing in there at all. I mean, they’ve taken $438 million for hospitals, for universities, for  police and they’ve got all that and Kevin Rudd has a five page document which doesn’t even  commit the PNG Government to resettle everybody there who is sent there. So it’s a big con,  it’s a big bluff. Now it might have a short term impact but the long term impact, look at the  Malaysian people swap and what happened after that.

PRESENTER:

But if you’re the Minister and they are found to be genuine refugees having ended up on  Manus Island, is there then a chance that they might come to Australia?

SCOTT MORRISON:

Our policy, which will be effectively the same as the governments, is that they would seek  resettlement in a country other than Australia and on Nauru in particular, what we’ll be doing  is building accommodation so they can spend many, many years there while they would be  seeking that outcome other than Australia.

PRESENTER:

Who would organise that, the United Nations High Commissioner?

SCOTT MORRISON:

The UNHCR, the IOM, all these organisations would be involved, as they were last time.   But in order to make offshore processing work, you have to have accommodation for people  after they are found to be refugees in those countries. Now, we will provide that in Nauru. In  Papua New Guinea there is no announcement as to where these people would live once they  are found to be refugees. We’re already seeing in Papua New Guinea some real reaction in  the community saying we won’t cop it, we won’t cop people just coming here and living in  the community. I mean, I’ve been to PNG many, many times and I think there will be real  practical issues of integrating those people in the community.

PRESENTER:

Scott Morrison is our guest, we’re live from the EKKA. We’ll get to your calls in just a few  minutes if you don’t mind, just one or two things I’ll raise with the Minister. One or two that  I haven’t heard raised, Scott, either.  I just wanted to talk a little about our response to the

crews of the boats that are coming our way and Indonesia’s responsibilities in all of this. I  read yesterday that almost all of the crews of asylum seeker boats are being sent home  without charge.

SCOTT MORRISON:

True.

PRESENTER:

Just ten arrests this year, from the 248 vessels that have arrived since the new year. So two  questions out of this, several points - why are we so lenient on an issue that is of huge  importance to Australia whilst respecting Indonesia’s right to be so tough on the drugs  question that has priority to their national security interests, and what will you do about that?

SCOTT MORRISON:

Well prosecute people for breaking our laws and that’s what the government is not doing.  We’ve had ten people as you say out of over 500 just this year alone, who have been  prosecuted and the government gave an instruction to the officials not to prosecute people if  they were a first time offender, breaking our laws and bringing people to Australia on  dangerous boats. Now, I was gobsmacked when I found this out. I was in Darwin last Friday  and I visited the Northern Immigration Detention Centre and that is where the crews are held  when they take them off the boats. And I’m walking through there and I turned to the guys  and said, this doesn’t look as busy as it used to and then they explained to me the change in  the policy. And those figures were then brought out in The Australian the other day which  backed this up, and Nicola Roxon who was Attorney General said, no, we’re not going to  prosecute you if you’re a first time offender. So I mean, how can the government say they  want to be tough on our borders but they’re actually not going to prosecute people for  breaking our border protection laws?

PRESENTER:

See I’m just wondering about this. It seems to be an unequal balance in our respect for what  Indonesia is seeking to do with drugs and what we’re seeking to do with these boats because  there’s no ‘first time and you’re out’ rule related to drugs over there, is there?

SCOTT MORRISON:

I know and this wasn’t, I believe, Indonesia’s doing. This was our own Government’s doing.  It all got too hard and what we see is the true colours of the Labor Party when it comes to  border protection. I mean, they’re effectively, this would be the comparison. If you’re a drug  dealer in Australia, well we’re not going to prosecute you, we just want to go after the  kingpins. That’s what they’re saying.

PRESENTER:

And you have no kingpins unless you’ve got the peddlers, do you?

SCOTT MORRISON:



Absolutely. So how easy is it for people smugglers to go and recruit crews in Indonesia when  they say, you only have to do it once, we’ll pay you, you’ll spend a couple of weeks in  Darwin and then they’ll fly you home.

PRESENTER:

Do you need to deal, if you’re Minister, with your colleagues in Indonesia to say, listen,  we’re now really going to get tough about this, if your people bring boats in, they’re going to  jail?

SCOTT MORRISON:

Absolutely. Now there are separate arrangements for minors and we’re not quibbling over  that, but we’re talking about adults, people who have been paid to break our laws and bring  people to Australia who are also breaking our laws in terms of visa on arrival which they  should have and they don’t have that. That’s why I say they illegally enter Australia. It just  shows them up for being all talk. You can’t say you’re tough on your borders if you’re not  going to actually prosecute people who break those laws.

PRESENTER:

One other final question, it’s a little bit out of left field. We’ve seen a huge increase in the  number of boats coming, a lot of them since the live export debacle. Is there any link? What  we did to them re cattle and what we did to ourselves of course, and the number of boats  coming our way?

SCOTT MORRISON:

Well it’s hard to say. But I mean the borders up there can be quite porous with people leaving  and this is why we announced Operation Sovereign Borders because what we have learnt  over the last four years watching Labor’s failures is the lack of connection and coordination,  whether it’s between Federal Police, Customs, our Border Protection Command, our DIAC  offices, our intelligence services. And we saw that with the Captain Emad thing. You  remember Captain Emad comes in on a boat, we had three agencies actually looking at him  and he was pushing a shopping trolley around a Canberra shopping centre working there,  living in public housing. When the balloon went up and the ABC ran that report on him, he  was out on the next plane and nobody knew. Now that’s why Operation Sovereign Borders is  so important, having this three star actually bring all of this together under one command and  actually get all of these agencies working together to stop this thing. Whether it’s in  Indonesia, whether it’s in Australia, whether it’s in Pakistan or Iran, you’ve got to take them  on everywhere.

PRESENTER:

Ok I wanted to raise that issue of other migrants and a wider policy in a moment too but  we’ve got callers waiting, we’ll come back to those next. Scott Morrison, the Shadow  Immigration spokesman is here and if elected, will be Minister come September 8. We are  live from the EKKA and here every day right throughout the exhibition and the Shadow  Immigration spokesman Scott Morrison is here, we did ask the Minister, Tony Burke as well.

Tony had a prior commitment but he will join us and sometime during the campaign both  Scott and the Minister Tony Burke will debate this issue with us. Andrew at River Hills, go  right ahead for Scott Morrison.

CALLER:

Yes, hello Scott.

SCOTT MORRISON:

G’day, how are you doing, Andrew?

CALLER:

Not too bad.

PRESENTER:

Go ahead, Andrew.

SCOTT MORRISON:

What would you like to know?

CALLER:

I’ve got an addition to Scott’s policy for asylum seekers. I’d like to put forward that after the  asylum seekers have been processed and identified and found not to be a genuine refugee,  maybe they could put them to a UN camp and mark the paperwork not to return to Australia  and then take genuine asylum seekers from the camp and then bring them over to Australia.

PRESENTER:

Yeah, what do you think?

SCOTT MORRISON:

Well, people who are found not to be refugees should go home. They shouldn’t go to a camp,  they should go back to their country of origin because they’re not a refugee. But the policy  that we have pursued over a long period of time is to ensure that genuine refugees do get to  come to Australia through the orderly process and one of the great tragedies of the  government’s approach has been that 15,000 people waiting in camps around the world have  not got visas in Australia, permanent visas in Australia, who have gone through the right  channels because they’ve been taken by people who come on boats and what’s why we’ll  make those changes.

PRESENTER:

Danielle at Strathpine, go right ahead.

CALLER:

Good morning, Scott. Good morning, Greg.

SCOTT MORRISON:

G’day Danielle.

PRESENTER:

I wanted to ask how hard is it to come to Australia by coming through the right channels?

SCOTT MORRISON:

Well, we give out 13,750 places under the Coalition policy and they will all go to people  who’ve come the right way. The government’s policy is 20,000 but that includes all the  people who come by boat, and we had 25,000 turn up last year, so that gets significantly  eroded but up to about 40,000 people apply offshore every year and that’s why it’s important  that we maximise the places that are available to them and what Labor’s policies have done  has been to deny those trying to come the right way.

PRESENTER:

Scott, is there room for a bigger intake?

SCOTT MORRISON:

Well we think 13,750 if you quarantine it to those who come the right way.  I mean, more  people coming the right way will get a visa under the Coalition than under Labor because  under Labor, 20,000 people - that might be the pool of visas but the people coming on boats  get the first take of them.



PRESENTER:

Yeah. Slightly related but more wide afield, are you a fan of a Big Australia or not?

SCOTT MORRISON:

I think you’ve got to have a sustainable rate of population growth and I think immigration has  built the country. I think it’s made us prosperous and as long as immigration focuses on  bringing people to the country who get a job, can speak English and we encourage them in  integration into the community, then I think it’s all good for the country.

PRESENTER:

Not a lot of time, let me zip through some more calls.  Wendy of Mt Gravatt, go right ahead.

CALLER:

Good morning, Mr Morrison.



SCOTT MORRISON:

Good morning.

CALLER:

Could you explain to me why the wealthy Arab countries, Muslim countries, are not putting  their hands up to take more of these Muslim refugees or asylum seekers in their plight?

SCOTT MORRISON:

I think it’s a very good question and there’s no real good answer to that that I’ve been able to  determine.  And particularly when you’ve got large numbers of Christians particularly in the  Middle East at the moment, whether in Syria or in Iraq or other places who are suffering, or  Egypt in particular. They’re the sort of people who we would normally bring out under our  Refugee and Humanitarian programme and they’re the ones who are being denied under this  government’s policies because so many people have come by boat.



PRESENTER:

Gary at Redcliffe, your turn.

CALLER:

Scott, just wondering - the 30,000 that are on temporary visas, how quickly can they be sent  home if they are not found to be genuine refugees?

SCOTT MORRISON:

Well, after say six months or up to three years, we’d be providing a temporary visa and at that  point in time that’s when you’d assess it again and if they’re found no longer to be needing  protection, well they’d go home. That would be the condition of the visa. But what the  government is going to do is give all of those 30,000, if they’re found to be refugees,  permanent visas and that will be it.



PRESENTER:

What’s the situation with Iran, because I understand they don’t take voluntary returnees  back?

SCOTT MORRISON:

Oh they’ll take a voluntary return, but they won’t take a forced return.

PRESENTER:

Oh, ok.

SCOTT MORRISON:



So that’s why programmes like what we would run on Nauru are so important. 30 per cent of  people who went through the Pacific Solution when we ran it went home because the  opportunity to come to Australia, if they were found not to be a refugee, didn’t exist.

PRESENTER:

Is there a real case to be made for some of the Iranians or not?

SCOTT MORRISON:

Well look, when I’ve seen people come off the boats and you’ve got to look at every case, but  frankly recently I saw some people coming off the boats which frankly looked like military  and that really concerned me. I think there are some security issues there and what we are  seeing I think particularly coming out of Iran at the moment is a travel business.

PRESENTER:

Are they responsible for a lot of the trouble in the camps?

SCOTT MORRISON:

There’s no doubt about that. It goes back to Christmas Island, it goes back to Villawood, it  happened on Nauru. I was there just a week or so ago and I saw the damage and they’ve been  the principle ones responsible for that.

PRESENTER:

Christine at Cleveland, your turn for Scott Morrison.

CALLER:

Yes, good morning Scott and Greg. I would like to know, Scott, do the refugees staying in  PNG, if they do not come to Australia, are they supported by the taxpayer of Australia and  Centrelink?

SCOTT MORRISON:

Well I can only assume they will be, the government hasn’t come clean about that but here in  Queensland in particular, people know, I mean it’s a lot easier to get across the Torres  Straight than it is to get to Christmas Island and with people being resettled in PNG, if that  indeed happens, then I think that is another area of concern which Campbell Newman I think  was right to point out, and I think that is something that also highlights the difficulty of this  policy.

PRESENTER:

Judith is in the city for Scott Morrison.

CALLER:



Good morning to both of you.

SCOTT MORRISON:

G’day Judith.

CALLER:

I am just enquiring as to the arrival of the asylum seekers in Indonesia via plane, they  generally get a visa as they come into that country, then they make their way down to the  ports to get on a boat.



SCOTT MORRISON:

True.

CALLER:

And when they arrive in our country, there’s no passport on them.  So why do Indonesia issue  a visa in the first place?

SCOTT MORRISON:

Well there’s been some good developments on that front but that doesn’t mean that people  won’t necessarily be granted a visa to get into Indonesia, but our policy is that if you throw  away your documents, and we’ll know that you’ve done that because you’ve come in on a  plane,  you will not get refugee status by an Australian authority.  The government’s policy  on that by the way is to give them the benefit of the doubt, they’ll just have to wait a little  while longer for their visa and we think that’s the wrong approach. No documents, you’ve  thrown them away, you won’t be given the benefit of the doubt by a Coalition Government  under Tony Abbott.

PRESENTER:

I saw Greg Sheridan, Greg’s on our programme from time to time and many of our listeners  respect him, as I do.  He said whilst acknowledging the good parts of what you’re talking  about and acknowledging that maybe part of Manus Island will work, that maybe we’re part  of a worldwide problem now for which there is no easy solution.  How do you respond to  that?

SCOTT MORRISON:

Well the push factors have always been there, there were 12 million refugees when John  Howard dealt with this problem 10 years ago, there are 10.5 million defined by the UNHCR  today. So there’s always push factors, the thing that changed between 2007 and today is  Kevin Rudd, he is the one who changed the policies and that’s why 50,000 people have now  turned up as a result of his decision. And not one word of contrition from him. He’s going to  an election seeking a pardon for something he won’t even confess.

PRESENTER:

We only have time for one or two quick questions.  Alan of Strathpine, yours is one.  Go  ahead Alan.

CALLER:

What happens to the boats when they arrive at Christmas Island, are they sent back to  Indonesia?

SCOTT MORRISON:

They are taken to a particular zone, Alan, where they are burnt and scuttled.

PRESENTER:

OK Russell from Dalby - might need to be the last one this morning, we’ll do it again through  the campaign.  Go ahead, Russell.

CALLER:

Scott, how are you?

SCOTT MORRISON:

I’m well, Russell.

CALLER:

What we are setting ourselves up for is a friendly invasion. What do we do when there’s a  thousand boats a day turning up? Because this was identified years ago as the biggest risk for  Australia but no one’s talking about it. You can now invade a country in a friendly fashion,  you don’t have to turn up with navy ships with guns blazing.

SCOTT MORRISON:

Well 50,000 people have turned up since Kevin Rudd made that decision and that’s why a  key part of our policy with everything else, I mean it’s just not about doing one thing like  PNG as the Prime Minister is saying, you’ve got to do everything. A key component of that is  turning boats back where it’s safe to do so and actually having our border protection  command not act as a taxi service which they, I don’t think, welcome that role, they want to  be in the business of protecting our borders and that’s what a Coalition government will  do.

PRESENTER:

We are getting breaking news that Peter Beattie is running for the seat of Forde, we’ll get  more details of that in our news which is a couple of minutes away. Scott Morrison our guest  at the EKKA, thank you very much for coming by.

SCOTT MORRISON:



Thanks very much, great to be here at EKKA and in Brisbane, we’ll be with Teresa Gambaro  today who is doing a great job in the seat of Brisbane and Bert Van Manen, he’s a great  member for Forde.

PRESENTER:

We’ll stay in touch throughout the campaign and get you on with Tony Burke before it’s all  over. Enjoy the day.

SCOTT MORRISON:

Thanks, Greg.
