"Today on Sunday" - Laurie Oakes interview with Minister for Foreign  Affairs, Stephen Smith MP Transcript, E&OE

11 April 2010

Laurie Oakes: Minister, welcome to the program.

Stephen Smith: Pleasure Laurie.

Laurie Oakes: The boats are coming thick and fast, we had another one arriving

yesterday, did the Government leave it too long to act?

Stephen Smith: We've been giving very careful consideration to what is clearly a very difficult problem. We've been

working through, at the relevant Cabinet sub-committees — the Border Protection Committee and the National Security

Committee — to come up with a response which we think meets our international obligations but also is strong so far

as border protection is concerned and so we've done it carefully and methodically.

We're not asserting or suggesting that this will stop the flow of boats in the short term, but it does send a message to

the people smugglers and to their potential prey, that if you come to Australia, from Sri Lanka or from Afghanistan,

there'll be a three or a six month pause and you will not be guaranteed a visa.

Laurie Oakes: Well, the measures announced on Friday, as you say, won't reduce the arrival of boats in the short term

but if they don't have any effect at all will you consider other measures, are there other measures in the pipeline that

you could enact?

Stephen Smith: I think it's careful in the first instance to contemplate what effect we think they will have. As I say, a

three and a six month suspension in the first instance but also given the evolving and changing country circumstances

which go to the definition, or the rights of an asylum seeker to be classified as a refugee, we've already seen, as the

Immigration Minister has made clear, over the last recent period, changing determination outcomes, a smaller number

of visas being successfully awarded.

So the basis for our decision was evolving circumstances in Sri Lanka and Afghanistan, as they relate to the definition

or the classification of a refugee. You have to have a well-founded fear of persecution and we thought it appropriate to

suspend while that information — those circumstances — work their way through the system. So we're already seeing

potentially a reduction in the number of visas.

The most effective message to people smugglers is people being returned to their countries of origins because they're

not classified as a refugee. So we expect that it will have an impact but so far as the boats are concerned, the

Immigration Minister and I have been making it clear for some time we expect boats to continue.

As we speak there may well be desperate people from Sri Lanka and Afghanistan who want to continue their journey.

The message to them is, there'll be a suspension and you are not guaranteed a visa, you will not necessarily get the

outcome that criminal people smugglers told you that you would get.

Laurie Oakes: Now the Opposition's scare campaign must have been working for the Government to do this.

Stephen Smith: We're in an election year Laurie. People will make their own political judgments.  I think the important

thing about this decision by the Government is that it is clearly based on evolving country circumstances. As I say, we

did it carefully and methodically.

It's very important that we continue to meet the terms and conditions of the Refugee Convention. It's very important that

we discharge our international obligations, but it's also very important that we understand that the Australian public do

become concerned when boats come to our shores.

Successive Australian Governments have had this difficulty for 30 or 40 years, starting with boat people refugees from

Vietnam and Indo-China. So, we have effected, what we regard as an appropriate response, which is in Australia's

national interest. It discharges our international obligations, but at the same time, it protects and defends our border

and it seeks to bring rigour to asylum seeker processing and rigour to our immigration system.

Laurie Oakes: Does this suspension apply to all Sri Lankan and Afghan asylum applications, or only to those from

people arriving in so-called, irregular entry vessels? I say so-called, because they seem to be entering very regularly?

Stephen Smith: No, it applies to both. There are different legal basis and status for those people who arrive by boat —

the illegal or unlawful maritime arrivals. But people also can arrive by different methods, generally by plane, and claim

asylum. But this applies to new asylum seekers from Sri Lanka and from Afghanistan. However they arrive from the

moment of announcement.

Laurie Oakes: What about if they're in transit countries?

Stephen Smith: Well, if they haven't arrived in Australia, or been intercepted in Australian waters, by the moment of our

announcement, then they are caught by the suspension. It applies to all new Sri Lankan and Afghan asylum seekers

from the moment of announcement, irrespective of the method in which you arrive. And that's another, if you like, piece

of evidence that points to the fact that this is based very squarely on the evolving and changing country circumstances,

as that relates to the definition of a refugee.  And we've seen, in recent days, the United Nations High Commissioner

for Refugees, essentially making the same point, so far as changing circumstances in Sri Lanka and Afghanistan are

concerned.

Laurie Oakes: Immigration Minister, Chris Evans, told the Senate just a few weeks ago. "Indefinite detention has a

much worse impact on people's mental health, than even say being in prison, because at least people in prison have a

time frame for when they'll be released." Now, you're taking that time frame away from Afghan and Sri Lankan asylum

seekers, how do you justify that?

Stephen Smith: Well, this is not indefinite detention.

Laurie Oakes: You've taken the time frame away from them?

Stephen Smith: We're not taking any rights away from people. There's a suspension for three and six months and they

will be processed when the suspension is lifted.

Laurie Oakes: But you say it might not be lifted in three or six months don't you?

Stephen Smith: No, we will review it in three months and in six months time. But it is not indefinite.

Laurie Oakes: So they don't have the time frame, do they?

Stephen Smith: Well, they won't be processed for a three or a six month period. But once processing resumes, none of

the rights that are currently accorded or afforded to them will be taken away from them. And Senator Evans has done a

very good job since he became Immigration Minister, making sure that what he inherited, which were very many people

on very, very long periods of indefinite detention, years, not months, including some people who'd actually been

classified as refugees who had not been processed for about a 12-month period, has done a very good job in reducing

those timetables and effectively eliminating that problem.

We want to, once processing starts, process people expeditiously and none of the rights that they currently have when

they are processed in Christmas Island will be taken away from them. As well as that, because we are conscious and

concerned of the conditions and the circumstances of people in detention, Senator Evans has ensured that there's

greater support and assistance given to people who are in detention and we fully expect and want that to continue. We

don't want to return to the bad old days where people are left in wilderness for years and where people are effectively

vilified for exercising their rights under the Refugee Convention.

Laurie Oakes: Now, you're suggesting that it might be safe enough for Afghans to return to their home country and yet,

your own department's website warns Australians against going there, and in fact says, if you're in Afghanistan, you

should consider leaving, which is exactly what the refugees have done? I mean, why are you prepared to send people

back to a place that your own department says is too dangerous to go to?

Stephen Smith: We will not send asylum seekers back to Afghanistan or Sri Lanka if there is a fear for their

persecution…

Laurie Oakes: But what if there's a fear for their lives Minister?

Stephen Smith: No. This needs to be very carefully understood Laurie. There's a qualitative difference between advice

that the Australian Government gives to the Australian travelling public, and whether you qualify for refugee status

under the Refugee Convention. You have to be the subject of a well-founded fear of persecution on the grounds of

race or ethnic origin or political belief, or religious beliefs. Now, that is qualitatively different from a straightforward

question of security.

Now, clearly in cases where there has been conflict, like Sri Lanka and Afghanistan, the prospects or the likelihood or

the chance of people being refugees is maximized or increased. But the point that I've made very carefully on the

announcement is that the evolving circumstances go to conditions, so far as asylum seeker applications are

concerned.

In Sri Lanka, they've recently held an election, the first time an all-country election has been held for some time.

Conditions for Tamils are improving. I'm not saying they're perfect, that's not being asserted. But there was a point in

time when, if you were a Tamil from Sri Lanka, or an Hazara from Afghanistan, you could mount a pretty good case

that you automatically qualified to be a refugee. We say that that is no longer automatically the case. There needs to

be a very careful case-by-case consideration. That's what the UNHCR, the United Nations High Commissioner for

Refugees, is saying...

Laurie Oakes: Just to try and pin this down, it's only about a well-founded fear of persecution? The fact that your life will

be in danger is not relevant in consideration of application claims?

Stephen Smith: We have not and will not return people to their countries of origins if there is fear that they will not be

safe, if there is fear that they will be persecuted. It's a qualitatively different question about the straightforward security

of a country. It is not applicable, or appropriate, to try and align advice that we give to the Australian travelling public

about particular countries and whether you qualify or don't qualify to be a refugee under the Convention.

Our approach is quite straightforward. If you are a refugee, we will give you protection. If you're not a refugee and it is

safe for you to return to your country because you will not be persecuted, we will return you. And that is the message,

the very clear message, that the Government's most recent changes send to people smugglers and to people who are

preyed upon by people smugglers.

Laurie Oakes: But this is all about politics, this is all about the election?

Stephen Smith: Laurie, if it was all about the elections, there would be no public policy or international basis for the

decision that we have made.

The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has made it clear that circumstances, so far as asylum seekers

or refugee applicants in both Sri Lanka and Afghanistan, are changing or evolving, particularly as it relates to Tamil

asylum seekers from Sri Lanka and to Hazara Afghans. We have responded to that in our own way, we've done a

careful methodical assessment and we've responded accordingly.

People will make their own judgments about election outcomes and the politics. The Australian public will have every

opportunity this year to make a judgment about the way in which we have tried to handle a very difficult problem which

has confronted successive Australian Governments for 30 or 40 years in different guises and in different contexts.

We don't want Australia's international standing to be shredded, as it has been previously. We will discharge our

international obligations, but we will also protect our borders. If people are not refugees, they will be returned to their

country of origin.

Laurie Oakes: Minister, I would like to raise a couple of other issues.

Stephen Smith: Sure.

Laurie Oakes: Firstly, things are getting worse in Thailand. The protests have turned bloody. At least 15 dead —

protestors, soldiers and a cameraman have been killed. What's your latest information out of Bangkok and what does it

mean for Australia?

Stephen Smith: Look, well the information overnight from our embassy is that 15 deaths have occurred. That's been

confirmed.

We're not aware that any Australian has been caught up in the violence and the protests. We strongly urge any

Australians who are in Thailand to avoid demonstrations and to avoid the protests, to carefully follow instructions given

by the local authorities, but to absolutely avoid the centres of protest.

We very much want the Thai Government and the Thai people to resolve these matters peacefully in accordance with

Thailand's democratic processes. We certainly don't want to see military intervention, but we have become very

concerned about the deteriorating situation overnight.

Laurie Oakes: Now, Minister, there's the issue of the use of fake Australian passports by an assassination team that

killed a Hamas leader in Dubai. You ordered an AFP investigation of that. What stage has it reached?

Stephen Smith: Well, on Friday, early afternoon Friday, I received a report from the Australian Federal Police. I haven't

yet had the opportunity of very carefully considering that, but it's clear from a preliminary assessment of that report that

I need to get further advice and see further work and have further discussion with other agencies. And when that work

has been done, and I've had the chance to fully consider, not just the AFP report, but also that further work and advice

from other agencies, then I'll make the detail of the Government's deliberations about this matter public. But I'm not

giving you a timetable...

Laurie Oakes: When you refer to other agencies, I assume you're talking about our intelligence agencies?

Stephen Smith: Yes, I'm talking about our intelligence agencies, about ASIO and ASIS. There's no point in being coy

about that.

Further work is required. Further consideration is required. When that is done, I'll let the Government's decision about

these matters be known publicly. But I'm not putting a timetable on it, nor am I proposing to give any commentary or

talk about it other than to indicate to you what I've said. It' appropriate to wait until all of that exhaustive work has been

done.

Laurie Oakes: Why has it taken so long? The British did their investigation much faster than we have. We had access

to their information. Why are we so slow?

Stephen Smith: Well, I don't think that's right. I certainly would not characterise it in that way.

The issue became an issue for us 10 or 14 days after it became clearly an issue for the British. They made their

response 10 or 14 days ago.

I want to make sure that we get this right. I need further work done by our intelligence agencies and I'm going to get

this right rather than rush it in any way. It's a very important issue. It has very significant ramifications for use of

passports and our relationships with a number of countries and I'm not proposing to be rushed. I want the exhaustive

work to be done carefully and properly.

Laurie Oakes: Minister, we thank you.

Stephen Smith: Thanks Laurie, thanks very much.
