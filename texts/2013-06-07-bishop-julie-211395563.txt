CHANNEL NINE, TODAY SHOW, IN THE HOUSE  INTERVIEW WITH KARL STEFANOVIC AND LISA WILKINSON

Subjects: Kevin Rudd and the Labor leadership, border protection policy, Federal election

E&OE…

KARL STEVANOVIC Welcome back to the show. Good to have your company today. It is  time for ‘In The House’. It wasn't the opposition that was hounding the Government this  week it was members of its own caucus.

LISA WILKINSON We're joined by Home Affairs Minister Jason Clare and Shadow Foreign  Affairs Minister Julie Bishop. Good morning to both of you.

JULIE BISHOP Good morning

KARL STEVANOVIC Well, he's back!!

Leigh Sales: I just want to make sure that nothing has changed in your mind. Is there any  scenario in which you would take the leadership of the Labor Party?

Kevin Rudd: Leigh, my position on that hasn't changed since February of last year. The  caucus had an opportunity to vote then and they voted 2-1 in favour of the Prime Minister  and against me. I have accepted that position. My job is to go and argue the case for Labor  and that is what I’ll be doing around the country between now and voting day. It is a good  case and we should not be hauling up the white flag.

KARL STEVANOVIC Jason, talk to me, he is back!!

JULIE BISHOP Come on Jason.

KARL STEVANOVIC Don’t laugh uncomfortably.

JASON CLARE Come on, Karl, that issue is done and dusted. What Kevin is saying is that  we need to fight, we need to fight hard for the things that we believe in and the election is  going to be a contest between the Labor Party and the Liberal party, Julia Gillard and Tony  Abbott…

JULIE BISHOP You’ve got to sort out your contest between her and Kevin first.

JASON CLARE …about whether we’re going to get a broadband network or not, about  whether kids are going to get more money for their schools or not.

KARL STEVANOVIC As much as you want to bring it down to policy, he pops his head up,  he knows how provocative it’s going to be.

JASON CLARE Former Prime Ministers are always on TV. Whether it’s John Howard….

JULIE BISHOP He’s not going for Tony’s job.

JASON CLARE …..Bob Hawke, Paul Keating. No, no, I’ve made this point on the show  before. The issue is done and dusted and the election is going to be between Julia Gillard and  Tony Abbott and I suspect that there are going to be a lot of pens in ballot boxes that are  going to be wavering on election day at the prospect of having Tony Abbott as the Prime  Minister of Australia.

JULIE BISHOP Jason that was Kevin still living the dream. He is like the old footy player.  He’s on the bench, he’s warming up, doing his stretches, running up and down the side lines,  ‘look at me, look at me’, he is dying to run on the field. The old captain, he’s back and he  wants to recapture the magic. Your team are so divided Jason, so dysfunctional, look at the  disaster on national security…..

JASON CLARE There’s more chance of you becoming Leader of the Opposition than Kevin  Rudd being the leader of the Labor Party.

JULIE BISHOP Just a minute what did you just say? There’s more what?

JASON CLARE I said there’s more chance of you becoming the Leader of the Opposition  than there is than Kevin Rudd becoming the Leader of the Labor Party.

JULIE BISHOP C’mon, Tony Abbott is the leader. Kevin Rudd wants to be the leader and  you know the fight is still going on. What an unsubtle message to his team. ‘Hello, I’m  back!’. The leadership tensions go on within Labor.

KARL STEVANOVIC I love it when you two lean into each other!!

JASON CLARE You like the lean? You like the lean?

JULIE BISHOP We can get a lot closer.

KARL STEVANOVIC Wow, we need to get out of the way Lisa!

LISA WILKINSON Clearly!

KARL STEVANOVIC Are you preparing for Kevin Rudd taking over or do you  acknowledge too that it’s a furphy?

JULIE BISHOP Anything can happen under this Government. Kevin deliberately didn't use  the words ‘under no circumstances would I be making a comeback’. He was very careful to  avoid that. I think it’s on. I think in the next two weeks we are going to see another round of  leadership tensions. They’ve got their own members packing up their offices.

KARL STEVANOVIC We will get onto that in a sec, we’ll get onto that in a sec.

LISA WILKINSON The thing is he didn’t miss you guys last night. This is what he had to  say about boat people:

Kevin Rudd: On the asylum seekers question, let’s just put his proposal in a nutshell, he says  he will stop the boats and he will send them back to Indonesia. That is an absolute lie. He  knows that, anyone who knows this area of policy knows that, it’s more of a slogan than a  substantive policy position.

LISA WILKINSON What he is saying there Julie Bishop is that he is just about slogans and  everybody does not believe that he is going to be able to stop the boats. How is Tony Abbott  going to stop the boats?

JULIE BISHOP Lisa first, Kevin Rudd on the eve of the 2007 elections said his policy was to  stop the boats, to turn them back. That was what Kevin Rudd said, he would turn the boats  back.

JASON CLARE Answer the question Julie. Answer the question.

JULIE BISHOP I am. He said he’d turn the boats back. So Kevin thought it could be done  when he was going to the election in 2007. We have a record that we can run on. The Howard  Government stopped the boats. We have done it before, we will do it again.

LISA WILKINSON How long will it take?

JULIE BISHOP We will work to introduce the temporary protection visas and that will  depend on the Senate. We will get the temporary protection visas in, we will continue with  offshore processing and we will turn back boats where it is safe to do so.

JASON CLARE When is it is safe to do so? When is it safe to turn a boat back?

JULIE BISHOP We will have an immediate impact. I don’t think Labor can run on its record.  42,000 people Jason have come by boat since you’ve been elected, hundreds of deaths at  sea…..

JASON CLARE Kevin got this one right and the policy is based on this great big lie that you  can stop the boats by turning boats back and Indonesia has said they won’t accept boats back.

KARL STEVANOVIC Have you done a deal with Indonesia?

JULIE BISHOP From opposition you cannot do a deal. We’ve had plenty of discussions.

KARL STEVANOVIC Have you been working on it? Because in 100 days you’ll be in  Government.

JULIE BISHOP We’ve had plenty of discussions at the highest level with Indonesia.

LISA WILKINSON Although Tony Abbott walked away from discussions with Yudhoyono.  Why was that?

JULIE BISHOP But from opposition you cannot negotiate with a foreign government.  Everybody knows that….

JASON CLARE You created that impression this week Julie. You made a very big mistake  this week Julie.

JULIE BISHOP ….and we haven’t got an agreement with Indonesia. We have a very close  relationship with Indonesia, with the officials, with the Ministers and we will work closely  with them.

KARL STEVANOVIC How will it go down this morning if Indonesian officials hear that  boats will be brought back to Indonesia under the stewardship of Australian naval vessels?

JULIE BISHOP The Indonesian officials are well aware of our policy. We will run on our  record. We stopped the boats before. Under Labor they unpicked the laws that work. We’ve  seen 42,000 people arrive and now the national security debacle that unfolded this week……

JASON CLARE Karl, this week Julie basically accused Indonesia of lying.

JULIE BISHOP That is outrageous. Withdraw that Jason. That is outrageous.

JASON CLARE The Indonesian Ambassador said, ‘no way, we are not going to take boats  back’.

JULIE BISHOP That is a terrible thing for you to say, that is a terrible thing for you to say.  You have no evidence.

JASON CLARE And then you said that ‘no, no, no what they say privately is different to  what they say publicly’. And I’ll tell you this Julie, if you were a Minister this week you  would have been sacked for saying that.

JULIE BISHOP You know who should be sacked? Your Attorney General who has got a  convicted terrorist…

JASON CLARE …and Julie effectively said that Indonesia was lying.

JULIE BISHOP I didn’t say that, and you’ve got a convicted terrorist living behind a pool  fence and none of your Ministers will take responsibility. Your Attorney-General, the  member for Isaacs, Mark Dreyfus said ‘oh, it’s ok, he hasn’t conducted himself in such a way  that he’s broken any laws in Australia, we’ve got no evidence that he’s committed any crimes  in Australia’. Is that your idea of national security? If a convicted terrorist hasn’t committed a  crime in Australia, you don’t think they’re a security risk?

KARL STEVANOVIC I just want to move on just quickly. That was fantastic debating by  the way, it’s riveting to be this close to something so fiery, it’s like Game of Thrones in 3D.

What we need to talk about though is the week that you’ve had. It has been, you must admit,  anus horribilis for want of better words for Labor the week. We’ve had first of all those  dismal poll results, Joel Fitzgibbon joking about being fed lines from party manuals, Labor  MPs packing up their offices in Canberra, a Queensland MP - Graham Perrett saying the  Government is in more trouble than Indiana Jones. It’s just a disaster with a capital D.

JASON CLARE We’ve got to band together and fight hard in this election.

KARL STEVANOVIC It’s not happening mate.

JASON CLARE We are behind, no doubt about that, but there is a long way to go.

KARL STEVANOVIC But you are all heading for the hills.

JASON CLARE No, no, no every Labor MP will fight hard to win their seat because there is  a lot at stake. For everybody that’s watching this show, what the country looks like will  depend upon whether we win this election or not.

KARL STEVANOVIC The problem is also that you’re not fighting together as a unit, you’re  fighting individually and everybody is going ‘righto I can’t win with the party so much on the  nose, I’ve got to try and win my own seat’.

JASON CLARE You’ve got to band together and argue the case that Labor always argues  and that is we’ve created almost a million jobs in this country, the Labor Party has always  been about jobs. I got involved in politics in the first place to help young people in Western  Sydney get a great education. This election will decide whether our schools get millions of  dollars more money or whether $16 billion gets ripped out of it. I really believe in these  things and the election will determine whether our schools get this or not.

LISA WILKINSON The trouble is you have not got a leader that can band you all together  because the lack of discipline at the moment is like nothing we’ve ever seen before. Is it  really just a case at the moment of every man for himself and every woman?

JASON CLARE You ask most of your viewers whether they like Tony Abbott and they’ll  say look I’m worried about this guy.

LISA WILKINSON The trouble is the polls, while they might be worried, the polls say that  on every level the Coalition is heading for Government.

JASON CLARE And there are, what, 99 days to go? There is still a long way to go.

JULIE BISHOP But Jason, you lot have given up governing. You are divided, you are  dysfunctional, there are two teams, you are still fighting over the leadership. In contrast the  Coalition ….

JASON CLARE Julie you’ve got a website that says countdown to victory. They’ve assumed  they’ve won already.

JULIE BISHOP We’re a team, we’re committed to a plan to provide a better and more secure  future for Australian people. We are operating as a team, one leader.

KARL STEVANOVIC We have to go, but I just think Jason it would be better if you all just  united under Kevin Rudd and got on with it. Don’t you think? Because Kevin wants that. I  just think we should go - ‘well alright if he wants it that badly let’s just do it’.

JULIE BISHOP Kevin’s just living the dream.

JASON CLARE I’ll just say this Karl, the ABC are getting rid of B1 and B2. Channel Nine  made a big mistake ten years ago when they punted Humphrey B Bear. I’m still getting over  it.

JULIE BISHOP Humphrey’s still around. I still see Humphrey.

JASON CLARE Well not like he used to be. There’s a chance for Channel Nine to put  Bananas in Pyjamas on after for you guys, and the advantage is these guys wear pants where  Humphrey didn’t. So I think this is the way to go.

KARL STEVANOVIC Well just to bring it back to Kevin Rudd. You made a big mistake  getting rid of Kevin Rudd.

JULIE BISHOP TouchÃÂ©, touchÃÂ©.

KARL STEVANOVIC Thank you Julie, lovely to see you.
