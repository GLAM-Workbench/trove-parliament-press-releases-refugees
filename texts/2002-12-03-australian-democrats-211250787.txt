SENATOR BRIAN GREIG:

Welcome members of the community, fellow politicians, federal and territory.  Parliamentarians  for Peace was an idea which came together in September of this year when it struck me, and oth-ers,  that  there  were  many  politicians  who  were  very  uncomfortable  with  the  way  Australia   seemed to be heading in terms of war with Iraq and were either implacably opposed to that idea  or at least very concerned with passionately and strongly looking at other options and working as  closely as we could with the United Nations.

So, we came together as a group, informally - this is our first formal function - with the following  key points in mind.  Principally:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢    We are keen to engage in community discussion and debate - and that’s what tonight is  all about,  Ã¢ÂÂ¢    As a way of looking at non-violent options for conflict resolution,  Ã¢ÂÂ¢    Our  aspirations  are  very  much  cross-party -  our  members  come  from  all  parties,  Coali-

tion, Greens, Labor, Democrats and Independent members of parliament,  Ã¢ÂÂ¢    We are keen to support the rule of international law,  Ã¢ÂÂ¢    We are keen to champion and prioritise diplomatic solutions for international disputes,  Ã¢ÂÂ¢    And, we are very keen to be non-party political in the way we go about things.

My fellow Parliamentarian for Peace, Mr Peter Andren, will introduce our first speaker.

MR PETER ANDREN:

Thank you Brian, and thank you for the initiative which lead to the establishment of this group.  I  certainly was eager to take part when Brian first rang me, having only a day or so before, moved  an amendment to a motion in the House involving Iraq and moving that  there be no Australian   engagement in that conflict without the endorsement of the United Nations.   It only made me re-alise  to  what  extent  this  nation  has  moved  in  terms  of  its  political  conscience  you  might  say,   when  Tony Windsor  (he  seconded  my amendment)  and  I were the  only two  to  effectively vote   against what was a move by the Government Leader in the House to stymie the debate, in other  words, they didn’t want to go to a vote on that most basic of issues. Despite all the rhetoric about  a United Nations endorsement,  when it came to the crunch, there wasn’t the will to support that.   So, when Brian rang me a day or so later and suggested that this group was going to be formed, I  was most eager to join.  I know there are many members around the House who have indicated  their support and elsewhere from the Territory as well and from the state and it is great that we  are having this forum, as this will be recorded and the transcript will be available for those who  are not here tonight.   I also understand it will be put onto the new website for the Parliamentari-ans for Peace, so it will get a broadcast beyond this particular theatre.

Dr  Chris  Reus-Smit  has  a  BA  Hons.,  MA  (La  Trobe),  Dip.Ed,  (Melb);  MA,  PHD  (Cornell),  is   Senior Fellow (Reader) and Head in the Department of International Relations, Research School  of Pacific and Asian Studies, ANU.   Dr Reus-Smit’s research interests focus on international re-lations theory, international history, law, ethics, institutional theory, and the application of social  and political theory to the study of global politics.  He is a member of Australia’s 20 member na-tional Foreign Affairs Council.  It is my great pleasure to introduce Dr Chris Reus Smit.

DR CHRIS REUS SMIT:

Let me begin by applauding this initiative.  I think it is particularly important on an issue as cen-tral as a potential conflict with Iraq that as broad a spectrum of political debate be fostered as pos-sible.  I think we are in a situation where the question of Iraq and how it is to be dealt with, goes  to the root of some of the most fundamental questions in international politics.  It goes to rights of  sovereignty, the nature of the rule of international law, how one deals with questions of weapons  of mass destruction and their proliferation, how one deals with the United States and the potential  for unilateral action.   These are really questions that are not just about Iraq, but they are of cen-tral importance to the kind of order and world that we will be living in for the next twenty to forty  years.   So, I think this is an issue that in fact, transcends the question of Iraq itself.

I want  to  begin  by really contrasting  where  we  are  now,  with  where  we  were  fourteen  months   ago.   Fourteen months ago the world was shocked by an horrendous criminal act of destruction  against  the  World  Trade  Centre  and  the  Pentagon  and  a  number  of  jet  airliners,  which  I  think   quite  rightly  shocked  the  consciousness  of  humanity  and  has  in  a  sense  reshaped  the  way  in   which we think about global security.

Fourteen months later, we find ourselves in the curious position of having moved from the ques-tion  of  how  we  deal  specifically  with  the  kinds  of  threat  that  produced  that  horrendous  act,  to   having the agenda dominated by the potential for a war of disarmament and a war ultimately, of  regime change in the sovereign state of Iraq.  I think there are serious questions about how, in the  period of fourteen months, we came to see the US and its allies, the Coalition Against Terrorism,  transform the agenda and the strategies that were going to be employed to place us in the situa-tion we are in at the moment.   I think there are four reasons that lie behind this particular shift  and this shift can be captured as one from a campaign against terrorism to a campaign against the  Axis of Evil.

There are I think four reasons; the first one is crucially important to anyone thinking about Iraq  and that is although the Bush Administration stresses the connection between Iraq and the terror-ist  threats  that  occurred  on  September  11,  and  the  continuing  terrorist  threat,  there  is  in  fact  a   separate  agenda  driving  the  push  toward  a  conflict  with  Iraq.   Displacing  Saddam  Hussein  has   been on the agenda of a particular conservative sector of the Conservative Party in the US since  the early 1990’s.   It continued on through in the politics of figures like Dick Cheney and Paul   Wolfowitz through the 1990’s in their disgruntlement with the foreign policies of the Clinton Ad-ministration and particularly with the Clinton Administration’s response to Iraq. This was taken  up by a group called The Project for a New American Century, which argued very much for the  kind of position that the Bush Administration is adopting at the moment with regard to Iraq.   We  have  now  learned  through  revelations  about  the  actual  nature  of  the  discussions  that  took  place   immediately after September 11, that right from the moment that the Bush Cabinet met to con-sider options, Iraq was placed on the table.  Is this the time to deal with Iraq?  Perhaps now is the  time to remove Saddam’s power.   So I think it is crucially important to understand that there is  an old agenda going on here that has been catalysed by the events of September 11 and has in a  sense, given head and licence to the pursuit of that agenda.

Secondly,  and  this  is  another  important  factor,  the  war  against  terrorism  is  a  war  that  produces   very few visible victories.   It is a war that is going to be very difficult to prosecute with any abil-ity to say “we finally succeeded in eradicating Al-Qaida or cognate groups”.   One of the things  about moving toward a campaign against the Axis of Evil and Iraq is that it actually has the po-

5

tential to deliver concrete victories which can be seen as clearly achievable.  Political objectives  which can be seen, can be markers of how successful the Bush Administration has been in prose-cuting post-September 11 campaigns.

The third reason is that one of the great difficulties about the war against terrorism is that it calls  for the use of resources and political capacities which are really not the trump cards of the Bush  Administration.   The Bush Administration has an immense military capacity at its hands but that  military capacity is  only of  limited  use,  once  one  moves  away from  talking about  dealing  with   specific  threatening states  like  Afghanistan  and  Iraq.   Instead,  the  kind  of  resources  needed  are   deep  policing  and  intelligence  network,  very  strong  diplomatic  politics  and  multi-lateral  co-operation - all of these things are the sorts of tools that the Bush Administration is not incapable  of participating in or using, but they are really not its forte or its preferred ground.   So this third  reason, favours ‘state-ising’ the war against terrorism and I think Iraq must be seen as fitting into  this category.

Finally,  and  this  relates  to  the  point  that  I just  made,  the  Bush  Administration,  although  it  has   made moves  to  engage in a thing it  calls  ‘multi-lateralism’,  which  is  basically ad  hoc coalition   building, it is actually allergic to the kind of deep, ongoing multi-lateralism through international  institutions  and  through  the  use  of  international  law  that  is  really  necessary  to  establish  a  sus-tained framework for dealing with the threat from terrorism.  But that allergy actually leads it into  the kind of policy responses that we’ve seen.

So these are some of the factors which have encouraged the kind of developments that have oc-curred over the last fourteen months.   I now just want to say a word about the debate about war  with Iraq.   I think one of the things that is really striking about the debate is that the protagonists,  those who are arguing in favour of a war against Iraq, are really the idealists in this debate.

The  argument  has  a  number  of  components  to  it.    The  first  is  the  idea  that  a  war  against  Iraq   would  be  quick  and  clean  -  at  least  in  terms  of  allied  casualties  and  hopefully  the  non-use  of   weapons of mass destruction.

Secondly,  I think  the  proponents’  position  also  assumes  that  Saddam  could  be  relatively easily   deposed and replaced by a fairly stable, sympathetic, quasi-democratic regime in Iraq.

Thirdly, there is a very clear assumption in their arguments that a transformation in Iraq would   actually have spill-over effects into the rest of the Middle East and these would be good spill-over  effects that would actually encourage regime change in other states; Syria, Iran, Saudi Arabia and  would probably lead to a moderation in anti-Western sentiment because of a kind of democratisa-tion of Iraq.

There is also the assumption that if you can change the middle east in those regards, that you’ll  also get some greater hope of resolving the Palestinian problem and of course the key to this is  the very strong assumption in their argument that a war against Iraq will ultimately lead to a de-cline, not an increase, in terrorist threats.

Now,  it  seems  to  me  that  all  of  these  require  substantial  leaps  of  faith  in  order  to  assume  they  would  be  possible.    Anyone  who  understands  anything  about  the  capacity  of  the  international   community to re-build states from the ground up, the history of the United States and its attempts  to  do  such,  the  attempts  by the  United  States  to  remodel  the  Middle  East,  would  have  to  be  at   least somewhat sceptical about these propositions.

6



Now of course on the other side, I think the opponents of a war with Iraq are actually the ones who  look decidedly realist.   They are the ones who would argue that there is at least some chance that a  war with Iraq, while certainly not seeing the defeat of the United States, could be protracted, say  three to six months, and could also be quite dirty, that is, Saddam could be prompted to use weap-ons of mass destruction.  Also there could be not only large US casualties, but any reasonable as-sumption about a war on Iraq, particularly a battle for Baghdad, has to assume there would be at  least 20,000 Iraqi deaths and I think this is something which is really overlooked in the discussions  about a war with Iraq.   At precisely what humanitarian cost are we prepared to do this?

Also, the critics of the Bush Administration, argue that it is more than less likely that Middle East-ern states will become more unstable, not more stable, and that populations are likely to be radical-ised.   They also question whether or not there is much chance of establishing a viable, democratic  regime  in  Iraq  which  would  be  at  all  sympathetic  to  the  kinds  of  interest  that  Australia  or  the   United States might have.   There is the question about the impact it is likely to have on the Pales-tinian conflict and opponents are quite rightly suggesting that at best, it is likely to be unhelpful, at  worst a further compounding factor.

Finally, those who argue against a war with Iraq, argue quite persuasively that it is more than less  likely it will increase terrorist threats, not decrease them by at least fuelling further radicalisation  of extremist opinion.

My own view is that, although in other respects I am not generally classed as a realist, given the  dangers that a war with Iraq poses, we have to take very seriously these realist propositions about  the dangers which are likely from such a conflict.

Now, I want to conclude by suggesting a number of steps I think would be more rational responses  to global security, both with regard to disarming Iraq and also to the war against terrorism.

First of all, I think it is absolutely crucial to separate the issue of Iraq from the war against terror-ism.  I think it is crucial to treat the issue of Iraq as basically an issue of disarmament and deter-rents.



My second point relates to this in that we should not only treat the issue of Iraq as an issue disar-mament and deterrents, but it means we have to back away very clearly from trying to see it in any  respects as an issue of regime change.

I don’t want to be misunderstood here, I’m not at all suggesting that the Iraqi regime is in any way  palatable or in any way less horrendous than it is generally portrayed, however I think the costs of  attempting to displace Saddam and confuse the question of regime change with the other issue of  disarmament,  is  going to  make  the  issue  immensely difficult  in  the  UN  and  politically,  globally  and in terms of stability.

Thirdly, I think we have to recognise that a successful campaign against terrorism requires some-thing that I would call ‘deep multi-lateralism’.  I think this should include a number of initiatives.

First of all, I think we need globally integrated policing and intelligence networks which are con-sistent with the development and preservation of democratic rights and processes in all countries.    This is a crucial factor.  Often people talk about the development of policing and intelligent net-works in ways which will actually undermine democratic processes or processes of democratisa-

7

tion.   In our region, it is absolutely crucial that we understand those things must go ahead to-gether otherwise we will end up in a counter-productive situation.

Secondly, I think we need to develop articulated national and regional rapid reaction capacities.    We need to develop in this region, a capacity among states in a multilateral form, certain mecha-nisms whereby we can respond rapidly to threats as they emerge and as they are understood, to  avoid the need for unilateral action.

Thirdly, we need to develop global and regional programs to enhance state capacity and legiti-macy.    One  of  the  major  reasons  why we  have  seen  certain  states  become  bases  for  terrorist   groups  and  why states  come  to  ferment  the  kind  of  extremist  opinions  which  lie  behind  these   groups,  is  that  we  have  across  the  world  a  chronic  problem  of  state  capacity  and  legitimacy.     This has to be seen as a crucial aspect of global governance in an attempt to deal with these fun-damental problems and undercut the roots of terrorism.

Fourth and very fundamentally, I think we have to confront the question of reform of global, po-litical  and  economic  institutions.    The  regime  we  have  for  institutions  to  manage  the  global   economy, for distributing wealth and for establishing some forms of political accountability and  deliberation, are fundamentally inadequate for the kind of world in which we are living.  Terror-ism; one of its roots is a closure of political opportunity structures.   It is the closure of institu-tional capacities through which legitimate politics can be expressed.  Dealing with this has to be  a fundamental issue.

Fifth, it is crucial that we resolve some of the festering conflicts which provide lightning rods   for disaffection and of crucial importance here is the Palestinian problem.

Finally, and I think this is a background issue that not enough attention is being focussed on, is  that we have to be conscious not only of the need to pursue a deep multilateralism, but to under-stand that this actually has to be a multicultural multilaterialism.  It has to be a form of multilat-eralism internationally that is respectful of diversity and cultural difference and has to recognise  that it has to be a multilateralism that deals with and can accommodate, different views of the  world - different cosmologies, different religious positions, different cultural backgrounds.  Thank you.





MS HELEN CROSS MLA (ACT):

Good evening.  I have just learned earlier from Libby that she spent time in Indonesia, but she  was there eleven years before I was.   It would have been nice to know you during my time there  Libby.

Ms. Libby Lloyd is President of UNIFEM Australia (The United Nations Development Fund for  Women)  She is a former worker with refugees and former resident of Iraq (1989-90).   She has  also worked with UNHCR in Iraq (1989-90) as deputy Representative for UNHCR, with Iranian  refugees, and with displaced workers from Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.   Ms Lloyd also worked   closely with  the  Australian  Embassy for  periods  during the  Gulf  Crisis,  leading up  to  the  last   Iraq War, in particular supporting Australian and other hostages.   In 1992 Ms Lloyd was made a  Member of the Order of Australia for her contribution to refugees and to the international com-munity in Iraq and Kuwait.  It is my honour to introduce Ms Libby Lloyd.

MS LIBBY LLOYD:

Good evening.  Thank you very much for the invitation to speak, I must say that every day when I  read the news now I feel how important it is to be able to speak out with an alternative viewpoint  and it is with that, that I speak here tonight.   It is certainly from a very personal viewpoint and to  try to give you some sense of my experience of living and working in Iraq.  It is certainly dated,  but I follow with great interest what has been happening over the intervening time.  My association  with  Iraq,  working  with  refugees,  with  displaced  people  in  Iraq,  and  watching  the  result  of  the   sanctions following the war, are the reasons I have become actively involved with UNIFEM, the  United States Development Fund for Women, to see whether or not women of the world can try  and shape different viewpoints and a different way of responding to such distress.

The reason for my going to Iraq was to accompany my husband who was posted there and having  been associated with UNHCR earlier in Indonesia, where I worked with Indo-Chinese boat people,  it  seemed  a  wonderful  opportunity to  join  again.   They had  recently established  an  office  where   they  were  working  largely  with  Iranian  refugees,  many  of  whom  were  political  activists  who   crossed the border during and after the Iran/Iraq war and with a number of Kurds who had become  displaced dating back to 1979 and the Iranian Revolution.

This gave me the opportunity to travel quite extensively which was not an easy thing to do in Iraq,  we always required permission to move around.  But, having a job and permission to travel meant  I was able to travel to the south of Iraq and see quite frequently ,  a major refugee camp.  I did not  live the closeted life of a diplomat’s wife, I was able to join with the international Red Cross, I vis-ited  prisons  without  notice,  I looked  after  some  extraordinarily disadvantaged  illegal  immigrants   and refugees and displaced persons including those who would have liked to be accepted as refu-gees, but were not.

Another  of  the  stages,  post  August  2,  was  working  with  the  Australian  hostages.   They  called   themselves ‘guestages’ because they were different from the hostages of the United States, Japan,  France, Germany and Britain who were taken away and put on strategic sites.  The Australians ac-tually ended  up  having  five  months  of  ‘contained  holiday’  -  they were  not  allowed  to  leave  the   country,  but  were  allowed  to  travel.   They  all  got  to  know  Babylon  extremely  well  during  this   time.



My working with UNHCR also gave me access to all sorts of organisations that I otherwise would  not have had, and  I would really like to talk a little about my association with the Federation of  Iraqi  Women  which  is  something  which  has  become  quite  important  in  the  development  during   sanctions and post sanctions.  In fact, the relationship of the Federation of Iraqi Women and the  Iraqi Government was one that our Office of the Status of Women would certainly enjoy if they  could have as much input into policy.

It was quite incredible to live inside a country and watch this demonisation taking place.  For me,  as a pretty apolitical creature, it was quite an incredible experience to watch the scenario of the in-put from the media from  the West when we were living inside a country and my viewpoint was  distinctly different to theirs.

I guess if I go back to when we were first posted to Iraq.  In the beginning you have a completely  different view of another country.   We opened the Atlas and the first thing that really hits you are  the land borders - six land borders and a tiny little access to the sea, at the south.  For an Austra-

9

lian, where we live on an island and are resentful of anyone crossing the sea to our country with-out permission, it is really quite an amazing feeling to live within a country which has had argu-ments, fights, wars, hostile and friendly relations at different times with all those bordering coun-tries.



Iraq  is  an  incredibly significant  country in  the  Middle  East,  it  is  modern,  it  is  secular  and  it  is   multicultural.   We  had  lots  of  friends  who  were  Christians,  we  had  friends  who  were  Muslims   and we had friends who were of some of the other minorities.  I became particularly interested in  the Yazidi and we travelled a lot to the north of Iraq to visit them.  The Yazidi are the worship-pers  of  St  Lucifer  -  worshipping the  Devil  which  they see  as  an  incredibly logical  thing to  do.    After all, if God is all loving and will love all of us, why would you waste your time on him or  her, you may as well put your effort into the one that you’ve got to be worried about - which is  perhaps a bit of a lesson for what we’re talking about now.

In most of the cities of Iraq, the women wear modern dress, in fact cleavage on a Friday night for  weddings was something that was quite obvious.  Very few women in Baghdad were covered or  wore the hijab, quite a few were wearing hard hats as engineers on building sites, but very few  were covered.   We certainly saw rural women covered, coming in to trade in the City, but on the  whole it was a very liberated, very modern city.   Large minorities of Kurds and a small minority  of Christians play quite a significant role in Government.   The area is only twice as big as the  British Isles, but has a population the same as Australia.   The people are incredibly like us, it is  very easy to have an open, straightforward discussion.   Some of the best discussions I have ever  had on feminism have been with Iraqi men and women.  Our dinner table was invariably sparking  with different views and trying to understand why Western women were trying to push the line  they were and how far Iraq was moving along the road to feminism.

Iraq is deeply opposed to religious fundamentalism and to extremist religious movements which  is of course one of the reasons that its current leader has taken such a firm line.   This is perhaps a  rather modest way of describing the way the country is run because it is really run very oppres-sively.    We  were  very aware  of  the  Mukhabarat,  the  secret  police,  as  they moved  around  and   there were certain subjects you did not talk about openly inside the country.   One of my closest  friends was an Australian woman who is the wife of a Professor of English at the Baghdad Uni-versity and she was always a wonderful interpreter for me for what was actually happening inside  the country.

During the Iraq/Iran Revolution 1980 - 1988, the Federation of Iraqi Women really took on some  major policy challenges.  The two they picked up were Education and Health.  With Education,  one of the problems was overpopulation at a very high population growth rate.  They decided too  high a number of Iraqi women were illiterate.  So they ran a literacy campaign during the period  of fighting a war, which I find quite remarkable.  As a result, the literacy rate of women rose from  22 percent to 86 percent during that time.

The  movement  to  get  health  facilities  to  the  outer  areas  of  the  country and  the  regions  was  in-credibly vigorous and I used to visit health clinics with refugees in quite remote places where we  would always find a doctor who was seconded to work for a two-year stint out of the city.

I wish to speak just briefly about the Gulf Crisis and living inside the country during that time.

We  woke  up  very early on  the  morning  of  the  2nd  August  to  hear  the  BBC  news  that  Iraq  had   stormed into Kuwait at 5.00 am.  In fact there were all sorts of spin-offs from that; there was a

10



British airliner that had touched down at the airport in Kuwait and were waiting to take off when  suddenly the regime changed and they were all offloaded, taken to a hotel and did not re-emerge  until early in September.   So, there was a period when we were trying to hunt for the two Austra-lian residents who were on that flight and we, along with other embassies, were trying to locate  people who had gone missing.   There was an aircraft on the runway at Baghdad waiting to take  off and at midday, the borders were closed, the plane came back, passengers disembarked and the  borders were closed for three weeks - to us as well.  No-one was allowed in and no-one was al-lowed out.   For someone who had always enjoyed the freedom to travel, generally stopped only  by economic reasons or time constraints not because you simply cannot.   It was really quite an   extraordinary thing for me to not be able to move.

After three weeks the borders were lifted for diplomats.  A whole lot of people including Ambas-sadors were all on holiday at that time because August is a hideous time of year with day tem-peratures often up to 55 or 60 degrees in Baghdad, and people liked to take the opportunity to go  away, but of course with such a crisis, people were trying to come back but then they had to sit in  Jordan for weeks waiting to return.

During that time, there was just so much happening, with embassies open 24 hours a day, people  were  staffing each  other’s  offices,  everyone  was  co-operating in  every possible  way and  it  was   surprising that even though the Iraqi’s didn’t really know what was happening, we got an enor-mous number of favours from Iraqi’s bureaucrats that we had got to know during that time.   Our  family left just before Christmas 1990 which was about two weeks before the war started and to  this day I am still incredulous that a war actually happened.   I felt that war was not the way that  we solved problems at the end of the twentieth century.  I really believed that there would be a  different solution.

So if we look now at what has happened to a population as a result of a war, and I speak particu-larly of women and children, the men continue to be employed, but the women have become less  employed.  We all know that the health services have been deprived and that malnutrition of chil-dren has become a really serious issue, in fact it is quite an illumination.  I checked UNICEF data  just before coming today and while the “Food for Oil Program” has improved the status of health,  it is still way below what it was in 1990.

Historically,  the  socio-economic  and  political  role of  women  in  Iraq  has  been  important  and  in   1993, the female enrolment rate at all educational levels was close to 38 percent.  This has now  completely dropped away.   In 1994, women represented 22 per cent of the labour force which is  still well above the neighbouring Arab countries.  I would also like to draw attention to the fact  that Iraq is a signatory to the CEDAW Convention and takes this really quite seriously.

If we look at the effect of a further war on the civilian population of Iraq, we must take into con-sideration that it is already so destabilised following the sanctions and the deprivation of educa-tion, health, agriculture and so on.  It would take a great deal for a country to pick up again and  get itself back into some semblance of order, (particularly a country that was leading in the Arab  world), to again become a country that had the potential to be a leader, to be a partner, to move  forward and bring an Arab country much more into the modern world.  This potential will inevi-tably be diminished if there is a war.  I guess the reason we are here tonight is that we firmly be-lieve there will not be, and sincerely hope that there will not be a war against Iraq.

It is hard to imagine what the refugee flows into Iran and neighbouring countries would be like.

11

Iran is just recovering and getting into some kind of order from its returning Afghan refugees and  refugees from Iraq from the earlier war.  I really believe that we have to stand firmly for a process  of resolution of our most recent problems through conventional diplomacy using all the facilities  offered by the UN and I know that this is what Stuart will talk about.

My own direct experience in dealing with Iraqi’s and the Iraqi Government assures me that they  are a society that has been toughened over many millenia through the harshness of their land and  climate and through the many conflicts with their neighbours.   They are a really proud and self-sufficient people who do not react well to direct attacks on their independence.   They do not give  up their independence readily, nor do they come to an agreement quickly if there are serious is-sues at stake.  Nevertheless, with patience and skill, it is usually possible to come to a negotiated  agreement with them.  They are in fact approachable and constructive in most encounters.   Their  officials are well educated, many in the West and many have a good understanding of the West,  and they have a very good understanding of Western official perspectives.  They are usually re-sponsive to commitments made under international agreements.   They have a long experience of  working with the United Nations and many of its various agencies, much of this constructive and  fruitful.  If the situation is not resolved peacefully, then life will become intolerable for a large  number of Iraqi women and children and possibly for populations in the neighbouring countries  as well.    Thank you.

SENATOR BRIAN GREIG:

Our  third  and  final  speaker  is  Professor  Stuart  Harris.   Professor  Harris  is  Emeritus  Professor   and Visiting Fellow at ANU in the Department of International Relations and a Visiting Fellow  in the Centre for Arab and Islamic Studies.   Professor Harris was formerly Secretary of the De-partment of Foreign Affairs and Trade and has written extensively on foreign political, strategic  and economic issues.  It is my pleasure to introduce Professor Stuart Harris:

PROFESSOR STUART HARRIS:

When it signed the Gulf War cease-fire following defeat in 1991, Iraq accepted unconditionally  the terms of Security Council Resolution 687 imposing a total ban on Iraqi weapons of mass de-struction and long range ballistic missiles.  Meanwhile, Resolution 687, which is still operative,  maintained the sanctions imposed earlier on Iraq.  Sanctions would be lifted when Iraq had met  the UN requirements.

Despite contrary views, inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and a  UN Special Commission (UNSCOM) made substantial progress.   After Iraq stopped cooperating  and the inspectors were withdrawn in 1998, the Security Council concluded that the bulk of Iraq’s  proscribed weapons had been eliminated, although important uncertainties remained on chemical  and biological weapons.

Why has the Iraq issue arisen again now?  The link between Iraq’s leader and 9/11 terrorism has  yet to be established and, given his secular regime, is improbable.  The case against Iraq rests os-tensibly on what has happened since the withdrawal of inspectors in 1998.  The US and Britain  argue  that  Iraq’s  resumption  of  its  weapons  programs  requires  immediate  action.   For  other  P5   members, considerable scepticism exists about the timing and its motivation.   The Blair dossier  does not convince in terms of immediacy.   And CIA Director Tenet has said Iraq would only use  weapons of mass destruction if attacked for regime change.

12



Moreover, the question of regime change - toppling Saddam Hussein - has been long on the neo-conservative republican agenda.  The Clinton administration also sought that objective but did lit-tle about it.  President Bush does want to do something about it but there is no legitimate UN basis  for changing a regime.

Mr.  Downer,  like  President  Bush,  argues  correctly that  Iraq  is  ignoring  UN  resolutions  and  that   cannot be permitted without showing the UN to be a paper tiger.  Of course, many other resolu-tions  have  been  ignored  as,  for  example,  by Israel  and  its  settlements  in  the  occupied  territories   with no similar evidence of concern.   Moreover, President Clinton’s comments that sanctions will  stay while Saddam is in power not only led to Iraq’s cooperation finally being withdrawn but ma-terially breached resolution 687.

So where does this take us? Let me start by asking whether the resumed inspections can work?   In  particular, can the new UN Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC) do  better than UNSCOM?  For that we need to look at why inspections were less than fully successful  in the past.

Without  underestimating  in  any way Iraq’s  failure  to  comply with  UN  requirements,  there  were   particular administrative and structural problems in the IAEA/UNSCOM design and processes:  (1) Material  support  for  IAEA/UNSCOM  was  inadequate.   (Thus  the  IAEA  was  given  a   budget a quarter of estimated needs).

(2) The  process  gained  only  limited  support  for  surprise  inspections  of  sensitive  sites   (‘palaces’), making deception easier.    (3) With  no  UN  intelligence  capability,  the  process  was  dependent  upon  other  countries,   notably the US and Israel, for intelligence  (4) There  were  turf  squabbles  between  IAEA  and  UNSCOM  and,  according  to  Scott

Ritter, within the US intelligence community  (5) There was also a problem of inspection team members providing strategic intelligence  to their own governments that Iraq categorised as spying.

Consequently, Iraq made important public relations gains among UN members, particularly Arab  countries  and  some  P5  members.   Some  administrative  problems  have  been  overcome  with  UN-MOVIC  (for  example,  inspectors  are  employed  as  UN  officials)  but  not  all  -  although  the  latest   UN resolution, number 1441, adds greatly to the pressure on Iraq as I note later.

To overcome previous structural problems there are other requirements:

(1) However odious Saddam Hussein is, without some incentive, Iraq’s sustained cooperation will  be reluctant.  That incentive is presumably the lifting of sanctions, as the original UN reso-lutions provided.

(2) Like Clinton’s statement that sanctions would remain while Saddam was in power, a US insis-tence on a total regime change, including Saddam’s departure, would also seem to reduce  the incentive to comply over the longer term.

(3) P5 differences, often driven by discordant domestic politics, ultimately undermined UNSCOM  as well as an admittedly imperfect UN sanctions regime.  Sustained P5 unity is essential,  even though differences remain substantial.



Without that unity, Iraq could play one off against the others - as it did in the 1990s.  Yet the P5  members have a variety of different interests.

13



For Britain, it is unclear what those interests are except that they are already involved, and it wants  to preserve a ‘special relationship’.

Other  P5  members  have  concerns  about  the  US  unilateral  threat  of  military force  because  of  the   principle involved, the lack of conviction about the Iraqi danger and the lack of limits on the US’  use of power.  For China, in particular, it is a case of self-protection.   There are also differences in  economic interests and many of the Russian and French elite argue that the US is concerned pri-marily with oil.

There are as well differences in expected outcomes - fears of long-term instability in the Gulf area  following a military attack, especially if without UN legitimation.  While Bush says a war on Iraq  will help the war on terrorism, many believe it will stimulate more terrorism.  US arguments that a  democracy can be established in Iraq, setting a regional example, seem especially naÃÂ¯ve or disin-genuous.

The P5 have an incentive, however, to go along with Bush.  If unity is not maintained, and Bush  goes it  alone,  the UN  process  will  be greatly devalued and  so  will  the influence and  status  their   memberships provide.

Unilateral US action would have a high cost, for the UN based international system, for long term  stability in the Middle East, and for an Australia which depends on a rules based international sys-tem.  It would also damage the war on terrorism and sharpen the growing East-West divide.

Yet, without some sense of major threat by the US of direct action, Iraq may have simply sat on  his hands, and the three P5 members have played political games.  The mix of interests and objec-tives  is  presumably why it  took  so  long to  achieve  the  critical  UN  Resolution  1441  three  weeks   ago.



Before looking at that resolution let me make some general points.

(1) As already noted, objectives remain unclear. Eliminating both Iraq’s weapons and Sad-dam  Hussein  are  incompatible  goals.   The  priority  should  be  on  removing  Iraq’s   weapons.    (2) Inspections can work. Ultimately, however, the inspectors cannot prove no WMDs ex-

ist.  The burden of proof is with Iraq to demonstrate compliance but time is needed  to judge whether compliance is complete.    (3) Continuing pressure on Iraq seems necessary.  However we judge the Bush administra-tion’s global strategy, the threat of military action most likely explains why Iraq has

accepted further inspections.  Sanctions were not sufficient as a stick because of the  debate about the effect on the Iraqi population.    (4) There is a need for carrots as well as sticks. Iraq needs to know that if it complies fully  and completely with inspections, sanctions will be increasingly lifted.  On that, the

US position is still unclear.    (5) If Iraq is obstructive, however, and military action is contemplated, most countries will  not now accept a US judgement alone on when that should be.

For that reason, we need to ask whether Resolution 1441 was a victory for internationalism or not.   In practice, the answer is yes and no.  While restraining US unilateralism to a degree, the clever  wording can, among other things, be used easily to justify US military action against Iraq.  Let me

14



actions.

(2)        R.  1441  says  that  Iraq  remains  in  material  breach  of  its  obligations  under,  among               others, resolution 687(the cease fire resolution); formally at least it could be argued              the  cease-fire  is  no  longer  in  effect.   Yet  it  could,  but  won’t,  be  argued  that  Clin             ton’s decision on sanctions is, and the operation of the no-fly zones were for a long              time, also material breaches  (3)       R. 1441 has some very general claims that Iraq’s has failed to comply with its com             mitments to end repression of the civilian population and to end support for interna             tional terrorism, but these are standards, distant from disarmament, that can easily              be used to justify war.

(4)       The criteria for determining non-compliance with R.1441 are not clear and make it              easy  for  the  US  to  argue  material  breach.   It  could,  of  course,  be  argued  that  R.               1441 uses weaker words than calling for members to use ‘all necessary means’ as in              Resolution 678 (the Gulf War resolution) and therefore unilateral US action would              be harder to justify as UN compatible.  Alternatively, however, it seemingly makes              the 1991 cease fire conditional on Saddam’s compliance, possibly to be judged not              by the Security Council but by individual members and therefore individual mem             ber action can validly follow - seemingly the US legal interpretation.    (5)       The condition of ‘full and immediate’ compliance leaves little room for error. Even              the  most  minor  disagreement  can  be  termed  a  material  breach.   Yet  the  barrier  to               full compliance has been raised with demands not on the original lists including, for              example, an inventory of all chemical programs, including those not related to              weapons issues.



There would  seem  to  be  many ways  to  justify conflict  with  Iraq if  these  (and  various  other)  de-mands are taken literally and used by the US, even should the rest of the Council not think a rela-tively minor breach sufficient to justify force.

It also leaves unclear whether the Security Council will lift sanctions if Iraq complies.  The opera-tive  wording  now  only  says  it  is  a  necessary,  not  a  sufficient,  condition.   Consequently  some   Council members want a stronger commitment.

Finally,  even  if  on  one  interpretation,  R.1441  makes  it  easy  to  justify  war,  at  least  it  does  not   authorise the US to go to war against Iraq.  Even so, Colin Powell said that, with a failure of Iraq  to comply, the US and other like-minded nations might take a judgement about it if the UN fails to  act.  That clearly puts the UN in an instrumental and subordinate - not a law setting - role.

In any case, the long standing differences between the US and Britain on the one hand and others  has  not  been  resolved  by R.  1441.   Consequently,  pressures  outside  the  UN  are  likely to  be  the   critical determinants of the outcome and the hope is that those pressures will support the continu-ing role for the UN in this issue and the more limited interpretation of its resolutions.



QUESTIONS:

Q:      I’d  like  to  think  the  United  Nations  and  other  countries  have  exhausted  diplomatic  ap-proaches in trying to find consensus or some sort of agreement or solution to this problem.  Could  you tell me how far does that diplomatic approach go before we reach an exhaustion stage - that  is, before something has to be done.

15



A:     (Professor Harris)  I suppose I would answer that by saying that’s why we have the United  Nations.  In fact, there are rules about the international system that says when you can go to war,  when  you  can’t  go  to  war  and  what  you  do  when  people  breach  those  rules.    Now,  there  are   breaches as much in their use as their non-use, but those rules do exist.  There have been some  very clear examples of where the United Nations system has worked very effectively and I guess  the  Korean  War  was  one,  the  Gulf  War  was  one  and  there  have  been  applications  of  sanctions   which  have  partially worked  at  least.   You  cannot  expect  a  perfect  set  of  situations  but  by and   large, the United Nations is the best we have and it’s a lot better than it’s often given credit for.   Now, it has a lot of faults, but it has rules on most of the things you are concerned about and we  should try to strengthen the United Nations and its ability to respond to breaches to these rules.    Now part of the problem is that countries are not always willing to do that, particularly in recent  years, not only Australia, but the United States has been unwilling to do that, so when I talk about  the lack of resources, that partly falls to member countries like the United States.

Q:     What are the perceptions by Iraqi women of feminism and views of women outside Iraq and  do they want to repeat the Western experience, or do they want something different?

A:  (Libby Lloyd)  I guess for me, one of the most lovely things was that I have always felt that it  is incredibly exotic to have friends from different places.  I had a friend from Sudan and I once  confessed to her that I thought it was incredibly exotic to have a friend from Sudan but she said  “not half as exotic as having a friend from Australia.”   So, I think the differences and our unique-ness in our relationships are really quite interesting.   The Iraqi’s I got to know were incredibly  independent  thinkers.   There  was  no  way  they  wanted  to  emulate  anything  that  they  saw  else-where, they wanted to create their own world, but I found them open and interested in what was  happening  elsewhere,  so  I  think,  as  far  as  I  understand,  they  were  never  looking  to  reproduce   what  Western  women  were  necessarily  aiming  for  because  I  think  quite  frequently,  and  quite   rightly in some cases, they thought they had greater influence in the way they were operating al-ready and when I’m talking about the Federation of Iraqi Women, the fact that the Government  did not make decisions without consulting with the Federation, which I’m not sure is replicating  in  our  own  country,  I found  really quite  interesting.    So,  in  a  sense  there  was  a  very equal  in-volvement and it is very different and very unique.

Q:      You  spoke  of the  tolerance  of  the  Iraqi  men  and  the  lack  of  fundamentalism  in  their  reli-gious make-up, how do you answer then the charge about the treatment of the Southern Shi’ites  and the Kurds?

A:  (Libby Lloyd)  I think I said earlier, that I am not a very political creature so I will try and  give an answer for the way I saw it working.   We traveled quite extensively in the North as well  and I mentioned that my particular fascination with Yazidi and we used to visit monasteries that  received considerable Government funding for their upkeep, and I was particularly interested in   the  Kurds  and  the  Kurdish  problem.   I’ve  always  been  interested  in  cross-cultural  communica-tions and awareness and the way other societies think and I think we have to develop some kind  of respect of the way another society views problems and the way they resolve them.

Going back to the Kurds, there certainly has been problems in the repression of the Kurds during  the 1980’s, but I would also like to point out that the Kurds can be extremely ‘naughty’ as well  and they did undertake acts of violence that threatened populations as well, but that said, I think  my view  was  that  the  Government  was  pretty heavy-handed  in  putting  down  opposition  of  any   sort and I think the same happened with the Shi’ites in the South and my understanding of what

16

happened was when their opposition was fermented, the Government used the same technique of  very heavy-handed putting down of different viewpoints.

Q:     Could any of the speakers comment on what they see the scenario being in the event that   Saddam Hussein is captured.   The United States are not all that keen on the International Court in  the Hague, would they summarily execute him ala ‘Western’ style eg Dead or Alive, or are they  going to finally recognise the international court, like they did in Yugoslavia?

A:  (Dr Chris Reus-Smit)  I think it’s highly unlikely that they would recognise the International  Criminal Court and use that procedure.  If I was a betting man, I think they would be expecting to  kill Saddam in whatever fighting occurs or for Saddam to kill himself in that process.  I suspect  they have not thought a lot about what would happen if they captured him.   If they did, I suspect  they would adopt exactly the same position that they have with characters like Noreiga or others  and that is that he would be dealt with through the American legal system and probably I suspect,  through the kind of legal arrangements that were adopted with the military tribunals for Al-Qaida  and the Taliban.  That’s my prediction.

Q:     Two questions; one I am personally very worried about Israel and the very high probability  that some of these weapons, if they do exist, will be turned on Israel. I’m not saying Israel is any  angel, but I am worried for them and I’d like to have my fears allayed by the speakers if that’s   possible.  Secondly, I simply do not understand the ‘super hawk’ attitude of (Tony) Blair.  I can-not get a fix on that at all.  Why this bloke is so pathetically grovelling to America is beyond my  comprehension?

A:  (Dr Chris Reus-Smit)  With regard to Israel, I think it is a very real risk that, if in fact a war is  launched  against  Saddam,  that  he  at  least  has  some  incentive  to  try  and  escalate  that  conflict   through whatever means he has to bring in the rest of the Middle-East and Arab community and I  expect the one way of doing that would be to lob shots at Israel to the extent that he has the ca-pacity.  Most of the intelligence suggests that that capacity is actually limited.   We know that his  missile arsenal is out-dated and very small and of limited range.  Also, most of the intelligence  suggests that there is very little capacity with regard to those missiles to be able to deliver what-ever  weapons  of  mass  destruction  he  may  have  and  the  greatest  likelihood  there  is  that  he  has   some chemical agents, but most agree that he does not have the capacity to deliver those very far.    So, first of all I think the incentive is there, the capacity is probably not there.   But, I think the  other point that needs to be made is that if that’s the thing we’re really worried about, and it is a  reasonable thing to worry about, it is also an issue that can be dealt with very effectively through  deterrents.   By establishing a deterrent regime against Saddam, such as; “if you’ve got those ca-pacities  and  you  intend  to  use  them,  you  know  that  if  you  use  them,  you’ll  receive massive  re-taliation in return”.   Often what happens is that deterrents are discredited in this kind of environ-ment, but it is the one area where it can be quite effective.

With regard to Blair, I think that the mystery that everyone is asking is how does one explain the  incredible enthusiasm that Blair has and I think the one answer that I have heard which is, I think,  reasonably compelling is that Blair, in his relationship with Clinton, very much identified himself  and Britain as being pioneers or entrepreneurs of a kind of new internationalism and this was go-ing to be an internationalism that involved a very vigorous activity on the part of the international  community to deal with threats to the peace and anti-social behaviour whether that be genocide or  weapons of mass destruction and according to this argument, what Blair has done is to decide to  fight that fight in his relationship with the Bush Administration and he really genuinely believes  that by cultivating a special relationship with the Bush Administration, he can continue to have

17



some kind of civilising effect on Bush’s policy.   Now of course, what happens is that as soon as  you buy into that kind of argument you also become part and parcel of the process, and I think  that’s as good as any explanation for what’s going on.

(Professor Stuart Harris)   I think I’d agree completely with that.  I think it is true that the evidence  suggests  the  capacity  that  Iraq  has  to  lob  weapons  into  Israel  at  this  stage  is  extremely  limited.    He’s been unable to weaponise both the chemical and biological weapons further than the extent  that he has them, so that I think while he will try to do what he can, he is very limited in what he  can do.  I agree with Chris also, on the issue of Blair.  I do find it puzzling and I’ve puzzled a long  time - Blair is almost an old fashioned Christian which is rather like the fundamental Christians in  the  United  States  who  join  with  the  Israelis  in  supporting  their  position  against  the  Palestinians.    Now that’s not Blair himself, but I think the concern about Israel probably rings truer in his mind  than in a lot of others.  I think it is true that the capacity of the Iraqi’s to do very much at this stage  in respect of Israel is still there and yet the reverse is, part of the reason the Americans are so keen  to do something about Iraq is the continuing fear that the Israelis have that this is their big enemy  in the region, and the one, if they are going to bring anyone under control, it will be Iraq.  And, if  you think about the Wolfowitz and the Pearl propositions in terms of what they want to do with  Iraq, which is to have a controlled zone in the south, which will, in theory, give an opportunity to  the military who they think wants to get rid of Saddam and his henchmen an ability to take over  control of Iraq.   It fits in with an Israeli proposition since it will require a large number of continu-ing presence of American troops, that this will give them the security that they don’t feel they’ve  got at present.  So, it gets rather complex, but I wouldn’t be too worried at this stage.

Q:     You  mentioned  that  Saddam  might  be  tempted  to  do  something  really  drastic.   No-one’s   even mentioned Al-Qaida and perhaps their opportunity to get in and muddy the water.  Do they  have the capacity to have a dirty bomb?  To use the opportunity of the congregation to really get in  there and do some terrible bombing thing in the Middle-East.  No-one’s talking about this?  No-one envisaged S-11.   They are just playing by the rules.   Bali, you know.

A:  (Professor Stuart Harris)   I don’t think a dirty bomb is, at this stage, too easy to develop.   It  seems  to  me  that  there  are  some  possibilities  of  doing  some  pretty  nasty  things  in  a  number  of   countries,  for  example  putting  a  bit  of  plutonium  in  a  water  supply  or  whatever,  so  there  are  a   range of things that can be done which are pretty unpleasant.  I think the thing about Iraq and this  seems to get lost totally, this is a secular, Muslim country which is the opposite of what Al-Qaida  wants.  Now it’s possible that there could be links with people in Iraq, with Al-Qaida, but it is not  very likely that there will be a significant level of infiltration, simply because Saddam’s police are  pretty effective and they would have jumped on it the moment they saw it happening.

I don’t think the Al-Qaida would see the Middle-East as their major target - which is in fact the  United States and the countries that support the United States, in particular, Saudi Arabia, so while  they will go for the Americans or their Allies, particularly the Americans, it’s not clear to me that  they’ve yet either targeted Iraq or that they are simply in the business of muddying waters.  I think  they’ve got very targeted objectives and they will continue to press for harming those objectives;  which are, America, Saudi Arabia and Israel.



ooooOOOOoooo
