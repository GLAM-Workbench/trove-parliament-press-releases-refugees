BIG GUNS OF POLITICS CHANNEL 7 SUNRISE 22 MARCH 2013

E&OE…………………………………………………………………………………

PRESENTER:

Joining us is Shadow Treasurer Joe Hockey. Kevin Rudd is not here this morning - he decided to  pull out after the spill - sorry Joe - so returning to the role - Environment Minister Tony Burke. Good  morning to you Tony.

TONY BURKE:

Nice to be here.

PRESENTER:

I bet it is because I am going to start with you. Really, ‘Situation: Normal’ for the Government this  morning?

TONY BURKE:

It was an awful day yesterday, an awful day. I think everyone in the Labor Party now needs to know  a couple of things. First of all - we can’t blame the media. It is silly for people to try and blame the  media. There has been a whole lot of speculation started by members of the Labor Party. Kevin  always said he wasn’t going to run. He didn’t run. It has got to be resolved now because otherwise  we can’t blame the media when good things that we do don’t get reported if there is speculation  about these other issues.

PRESENTER:

What got into Simon Crean’s head to absolutely call this on when he had been told by Kevin Rudd  beforehand that “Mate, if there’s a spill (then) I won’t run.”

TONY BURKE:

I saw your interview earlier with Bruce Hawker which, obviously, I was hearing a lot of that for the  first time. I don’t know what Simon was thinking. I will say though: Simon is a good man. He has  got a great career that he has been part of and I just hope the views over the last 24 hours don’t  characterise how Simon is viewed. He’s a very good man.

PRESENTER:

Joe, were you surprised when Simon Crean backed Kevin Rudd?

JOE HOCKEY:

No. I wasn’t because he was expressing an enormous amount of frustration with the direction of the  Government. You asked me what happened this week. I will tell you what happened. Ten boats  arrived with 600 people this week seeking asylum, reports have now emerged that the Government

has got deficits as far as the eye can see, the Government has effectively conceded $300 billion of  debt now, you have had a collapse of the anti-discrimination laws, a collapse of the media laws and  yesterday - during the leadership ballot - the National Broadband Network took out its trash and said

that, in fact, it will probably connect basically half the houses that they planned to connect this year.  They are the policy failures. What is the Government doing?  It is focusing on itself instead of  focusing on running the country and Australians have had enough.

PRESENTER:

Tony, Joe has a point there. The average Australian would be saying “Stop all these school boy  antics - we just want you to run the country”.  Can you guarantee you are focussing on running the  country?

TONY BURKE:

Absolutely, but can I also say about Joe’s characterisation of the week - he should have watched  Channel 7 news last night. What happened yesterday with the victims of forced adoption was an  issue that is running on news all around the world and was an extraordinarily important thing. One of

the best speeches I’ve ever heard in the Parliament was given yesterday by a Liberal Member of  Parliament - Steve Irons. To ignore things like that on a day as historic as yesterday - I appreciate it  and I don’t blame the media when there is leadership speculation, that’s all that’s going to be  focussed on - but to pretend that there haven’t been other major issues which have been really  important for Australia this week is mischaracterising it. Joe knows that.

JOE HOCKEY:

No. No. I’m sorry. What went well this week for you guys - the apology was of the Parliament and  you are right - a Liberal gave an outstanding speech. It is an awful issue. But hang on, these are the  things you as a Government are responsible for. Managing our borders, managing our budget, rolling  out the NBN, introducing media laws - what was that all about? What was that about Tony?  Seriously, Australians have had enough. We are going to move no confidence in the Government  and call an election at the next available opportunity because we have had enough and the Australian  people have had enough.

TONY BURKE:

And, Joe, we are also responsible for the impacts of coal seam gas. We had major changes to that go  through the Parliament yesterday. We are also responsible for brokering a Murray Darling deal that  has been something Australia hasn’t been able to achieve for a century which the disallowance  period expired on Tuesday for. What I am saying is - yeah there will be issues where we have our  political arguments. Yes, a whole lot of things that should be reported but don’t when there is  leadership speculation, but don’t pretend that nation building changes haven’t been happening during  the last week in a way they have been.

JOE HOCKEY:

Well now we are going to see a number of resignations from your front bench which means further  dislocation of the Government. If anyone thinks that Kevin - now,  you and I and maybe not Tony - you, Kochie, Mel, myself and the audience know Kevin Rudd - Kevin’s going to come back, he’s  going to try and come back.

PRESENTER:

Joe, he’s always said he would, but he wouldn’t run against anybody else.

JOE HOCKEY:

That’s right.

PRESENTER:

So he stuck to his word.   If he’d run yesterday you would have come on and said “How could you  trust this bloke because he went against his word?” He stuck to his word so then you do the opposite.

JOE HOCKEY:

No, hang on. Yesterday he said the preconditions for me running for the leadership have not been  met. So he didn’t say “I’m right behind Julia Gillard and I am going to work as hard as I can to help  the Labor Party win the next election.” He just said “Well, I am ready to serve but only on these  conditions. One, two, three.” Do you think the Labor Party is stopping at this point? You think that  the division in the Labor Party is going to end? Forget it! It’s going to keep going.

PRESENTER:

Tony, an email from a viewer saying “Was it clearly a Crean/Gillard setup?”

TONY BURKE:

Simon acted on his own, that’s my view of it. That’s what we just heard Bruce Hawker say on this  program a little bit earlier. I don’t think anyone is arguing Simon was doing anything other than that.

PRESENTER:

Okay, gents, thank you for that. A fascinating week in politics.

PRESENTER 2:

Oh Joe, I saw you last night on the telly holding it (the Real Solutions book) up and Tony Abbott  lifting his higher and higher so it wasn’t out of frame up. That’s the book - the plan.

TONY BURKE:

Oh no!

JOE HOCKEY:

I’ll sign a copy for anyone that wants one and send it to them, personally autographed.

PRESENTER:

Terrific.

JOE HOCKEY:

It’s a best seller.

TONY BURKE:

No one reads it Joe. You’d better hope not.

JOE HOCKEY:

It’s a best seller.

PRESENTER:

Have a good weekend.
