KIERAN GILBERT: Good morning and welcome to AM Agenda. The Foreign Minister Kevin Rudd is this  morning in New York at the United Nations attending crisis talks on flood devastated Pakistan. Mr  Rudd addressed the summit a short time ago.

[Start of excerpt from speech]

KEVIN RUDD: Australia has been a friend of Pakistan since the birth of the modern Pakistani state.  And when friends are in trouble the responsibility of all of us is to help and as demonstrated by the  attendance here in today's meeting Pakistan has many friends across the world. Australia has now  increased its assistance to the flood effort to some $75 million which across the world makes us I  believe the fifth largest donor country.

KIERAN GILBERT: Joining me this morning on the program to discuss Mr Rudd's visit and all the other  issues around today from Adelaide we've Liberal MP JAMIE BRIGGS. Good morning Jamie.

JAMIE BRIGGS: Good morning Kieran.

KIERAN GILBERT: And from Melbourne we have the Parliamentary Secretary for Foreign Affairs  RICHARD MARLES - Richard thank you for your time. First to you - Kevin Rudd has been off to a very  quick start onto the world stage within days - Pakistan, Washington, New York. Do you think he's had  a comfortable first few days as Foreign Minister and is it hard for him to adjust from being the top  person in government to being subordinate to Julia Gillard and Cabinet?

RICHARD MARLES: Well firstly I think that Kevin absolutely understands the importance and the  honour of being the Australian Foreign Minister and he's doing a great job. The way in which he's  being received in the United States - the visit with President Obama really indicates the strength of

the relationship between us and the US but also the great role that he can play as Australia's Foreign  Minister.

KIERAN GILBERT: Well you're Parliamentary Secretary for Foreign Affairs so you'll be reporting to  Kevin Rudd. Have you told your family you won't be seeing them much over the next year or so?

RICHARD MARLES: I'm well aware that this is a big job and this is going to require working a lot of  hours. Look I'm real excited about working with Kevin. I think he is the master in this area. There's a  lot for me to learn from him. It's his area of passion as in fact it is for me as well and it's a great  opportunity.

KIERAN GILBERT: JAMIE BRIGGS, as Richard said, the meetings in Washington, if you look at them  and the lengthy one with Hilary Clinton - she'd just got off the plane from the Middle East talks and  then President Obama dropped in as well. So it obviously does show that the former Prime Minister  now Foreign Minister is well connected in these circles.

JAMIE BRIGGS: Kieran I might just firstly start by wishing Richard all the best in getting over what  was obviously a terrible weekend for Richard on Friday night obviously...

RICHARD MARLES: You're a bad man Jamie.

JAMIE BRIGGS: ...with his love of Geelong, [laughs] getting flogged by Collingwood and letting us all  down Richard.

RICHARD MARLES: Oh dear.

JAMIE BRIGGS: Look the American/Australian relationship is strong and it's not surprising that the  Foreign Minister of our country is received well in the United States. I don't think that surprises  anybody. Alexander Downer was received very well when he used to visit the United States because  our relationship is extremely strong. So...

KIERAN GILBERT: Okay.

JAMIE BRIGGS: ...so I think no one is surprised by that.

KIERAN GILBERT: Let's cross to New York now - our political reporter ASHLEIGH GILLON is following  the Foreign Minister on his tour overseas. Ashleigh as we've been discussing with Richard and Jamie  - the former Prime Minister off to a very smooth start in his new role.

ASHLEIGH GILLON: Well yes Kieran we just saw Mr Rudd in New York at the United Nations making  his first appearance back on the world stage. But this time of course in the capacity of Foreign  Minister. Of course Mr Rudd is really taking to this role like a duck to water and we shouldn't be  surprised about that. We know that Mr Rudd was a former diplomat - his pet area is foreign affairs  and foreign policy. So he has really adjusted to this very smoothly. It is of course interesting to point  out that he was only sworn in a week ago so Mr Rudd really hasn't been shy in getting back out there  - reintroducing himself to the world now as the Foreign Minister.

If anyone thought that he might be shy in doing that, that he might be licking his wounds as - you  know on the international stage especially well they were wrong because he's really been straight

back out there from Pakistan to Washington now to New York and he'll be here for the rest of this  week. He's really not shying away from the limelight even though he's now been demoted to Foreign  Minister.

KIERAN GILBERT: And he's at the United Nations as you pointed out and we played a little bit of it at  the start of the program specifically Ashleigh at these crisis talks on Pakistan.

ASHLEIGH GILLON: Well yes, Mr Rudd went to Pakistan a few days ago - he toured the southern  Punjab region and saw firsthand just how devastating that flood crisis really is. This is an issue Kieran  that's slipped away from the front pages around the world but 20,000,000 people have been  affected, 10,000,000 people are homeless, some 6,000,000 people are still relying on emergency  food supplies. So it is a serious crisis. There is a feeling at the UN that it is a crisis that's been  underestimated and we heard Mr Rudd speaking at the UN about his specific fears about  waterborne diseases and just how this could even escalate further. So it is a real problem.

When Mr Rudd was in Pakistan he announced that Australia will be contributing an extra $40 million  to help the flood victims - that's on top of the initial $35 million. So Australia all up is coughing up so  far $75 million and Mr Rudd's really been urging the international community to boost their support  to the international appeal that's on at the moment for Pakistan.

KIERAN GILBERT: And Ashleigh a warm reception for Kevin Rudd in Washington. You were up there  for that state department visit. Hilary Clinton afforded Mr Rudd quite a bit of time after just arriving  back in the United States.

ASHLEIGH GILLON: Yes look it was quite chummy, chummy wasn't it, between Hilary Clinton and Mr  Rudd the other day. Of course standing side by side we saw Hilary Clinton announce that she will be  visiting Australia in November for those annual AUSMIN talks - the Australian Ministerial talks that  will be happening in Australia in November. Robert Gates of course the US Defence Secretary also  heading home for that as well. We did see them have a chuckle together, a laugh. Mr Rudd said that  he will show her a good time when she comes down under and she seem to be genuinely looking  forward to that visit. It is a visit that had been scheduled for earlier this year - Hilary Clinton was due  to visit but she had to cancel those plans to go and deal with the crisis in Haiti. So this is a  rescheduling of a visit that she had planned earlier this year. Also when Mr Rudd was in Washington  he went to the White House for a meeting with the US National Security Advisor General James  Jones and while he was at that meeting the US President Barack Obama just happened to pop in and  say hello. We know that in the US they really do treat former presidents with a huge amount of  respect. They really are revered. And I think here in the US Mr Rudd is being afforded that same sort  of level of respect as a former leader of our country.

KIERAN GILBERT: Ash I know you've got to get back to the UN to follow Mr Rudd's - his next  movements. Tell me what's on for the rest of the week.

ASHLEIGH GILLON: Well today already we have seen Mr Rudd starting some of the bilateral talks that  he's having here this week. He met with the President of Finland today. She's actually on that Global  Sustainability Panel that Mr Rudd is also on. You'll remember just after he was deposed the UN  Secretary General Ban Ki-moon called Kevin Rudd up and offered him this part time unpaid job on  that panel. So that panel met today for the first time. It's got a really wide brief this one. It's kind of

blue sky stuff. They're all going to be working towards coming up with a plan basically going forward  for the world where it comes to climate change, the reduction of poverty, water issues. The brief  really is quite wide ranging and Mr Rudd will be involved in three meetings over the next 14 months  or so to come up with some recommendations for the UN on that. A bit later in the week, Mr Rudd  will be delivering the address to the UN General Assembly. That is of course something that leaders  of countries around the world are invited to do. So in that sense he really is stepping in for Julia  Gillard to deliver that address.

But he has been very eager to point out that that's something that foreign ministers often step in to  do. That Alexander Downer for example delivered that speech on behalf of John Howard on a  number of occasions. So he doesn't want us to think that he's stepping on any toes there. But that  will be another moment like we saw today, Mr Rudd taking the international stage as Foreign  Minister.

KIERAN GILBERT: Ashleigh, thanks for that. We'll chat to you right throughout the week from New  York, appreciate it.

Let's go back to our panel now, RICHARD MARLES and JAMIE BRIGGS. Richard is it going to be  difficult for Julia Gillard to assert herself on the international stage, given the presence of the former  leader, his contacts and as we say - as Ashley pointed out in that report there, he's getting a lot of  good access in the States.

RICHARD MARLES: Well I don't think it can be a bad thing that an Australian foreign minister is being  received so well in the United States, which is obviously our most important ally. There's not going  to be any problem at all...

KIERAN GILBERT: [Interrupts] It doesn't distract from Gillard as she tries, obviously over coming  months to make her own presence on the international stage?

RICHARD MARLES: No, is the short answer to that question. There's not going to be any problem at  all in Julia Gillard walking the world stage. She is a class act, we all know that. She is going to  represent our country very, very well on the international stage.

As in fact she already did as the Deputy Prime Minister during the last three years. So it's something  that she's very comfortable with and I think she's going to be a fantastic Australian leader on the  international stage. And the fact that...

KIERAN GILBERT: [Interrupts] Jamie...

RICHARD MARLES: Kevin Rudd is being so well received is not a problem in that at all.

KIERAN GILBERT: JAMIE BRIGGS, I think you might disagree with that. You're expecting some  tensions I would have thought?

JAMIE BRIGGS: Oh well the Labor Party is just completely divided. You saw yesterday Mark Arbib  lashing out at all these internal critics on your network, Kieran. And you'll have Kevin Rudd strutting  himself to show the Australian public and to his colleagues that he would have still been a better  Prime Minister than Julia Gillard had he not been knifed in the middle of the night by the faceless  men of the Labor Party. Which I notice Mark Arbib, yesterday, is now claiming he is not one. So it is,

it's a completely divided show over there. And this is one of the reasons that we need to continue to  push, as we have been under the leadership of Tony Abbott to hold the government to account and  to keep the pressure up. And during this term, you never know you might even see a baton change  when everyone gets sick of the young and the restless on the Labor side of politics.

KIERAN GILBERT: Gentlemen, stay with us. We'll take a quick break and we'll be right back here on  AM Agenda. [Unrelated items - advertisement]

KIERAN GILBERT: Welcome back to AM Agenda. With me this morning from Melbourne, RICHARD  MARLES and in Adelaide, Liberal MP JAMIE BRIGGS. Jamie, this whole discussion that Rob  Oakeshott's going to have today with Tony Abbott about his prospects of becoming the Speaker in  the House of Representatives and the whole issue of parliamentary reforms. Is this essentially the  Coalition - Christopher Pine, Tony Abbott - wanting to avoid giving Labor an extra buffer of one extra  vote if Oakeshott does become Speaker? Is that essentially what this is all about?

JAMIE BRIGGS: No, not at all. What this is about is ensuring that the rule of law is maintained. You  can't enter an agreement to break the law and that's the point that Christopher Pine's been making.  So we're trying to work through the issues with Rob Oakeshott. We've said I think since the  agreement was struck with - between the independents and the Labor Party that we support Harry  Jenkins to remain as Speaker. We think he's done a reasonable job in the role and it makes sense to  continue with Harry in that role. There does seem to be some significant constitutional issues in  relation to Rob Oakeshott taking on the role if he wants to do the pairing. It doesn't appear like you  can have that pairing role. So in that respect we think Harry Jenkins makes a lot of sense. It's good  that Tony and Rob will have a chat this morning about that issue and several others I'm sure. We  have a good relationship, a good working relationship...

KIERAN GILBERT: [Interrupts] Because Rob says - Rob Oakeshott says he's deeply concerned, Jamie,  about the messages coming from the Coalition. He's concerned that you're backflipping, reneging on  that deal for parliamentary reform.

JAME BRIGGS: Not at all, no, no. The point that Christopher Pyne's made is you can't make an  agreement to break the law. So we have to get legal advice. Richard's mob say that they need to get  legal advice, as well. They are the government; they have all the resources of government at their  disposal to offer those sorts of constitutional views. Our view has simply been, you can't have an  agreement to break the law. We want to ensure that whatever the arrangements are for this  Parliament, they are lawful. If they're not, of course that has massive repercussions in the future. So  Christopher Pyne's doing exactly the right thing, exactly what the Australian people would expect  him to do.

KIERAN GILBERT: Richard, it does seem a bit odd at the moment where you've got Jamie and his  colleagues arguing for Harry Jenkins and endorsing his performance as Speaker. But no such  endorsements coming from Labor or arguments that Harry Jenkins should remain as Speaker. Are  you willing to offer one this morning for us?

RICHARD MARLES: [Break in audio transmission] ...the Government and I think everyone would  recognise that and recognise the role that he played. But look, Rob Oakeshott's come to us with a  proposal. We're looking at it in good faith. We're working that through with Rob. There's no

question that Rob would be an excellent candidate to be the Speaker of the House. There's  complexity in it which is why we're getting legal advice. And no one for a moment is suggesting that  there's going to be an agreement to break the law. We're getting that advice; we're going to work  through it and we're going to work through that with Rob. But I share Rob Oakeshott's concern  about where the Coalition's at in terms of this package of parliamentary reforms. This really was an  important breakthrough in the way in which the Parliament operates and I think just two weeks  down the track it is a bit of a concern that we're starting to see the Opposition do some acrobatics  on this. And I'd be very interested to see what the outcome of the meeting today is between Rob  Oakeshott and Tony Abbott.

KIERAN GILBERT: Richard, is this - on another issue now, Bob Brown is going to introduce a private  member's bill on reinstating the rights of the territories, the ACT and Northern Territory, to legislate  on euthanasia. Is this a sign of the times? Is this the sort of parliament that we're facing that Bob  Brown is going to do this almost straight off the bat next week when Parliament returns?

RICHARD MARLES: Well, Kieran I think it is and I think it's something to be embraced. We're going to  see different sorts of issues brought before the Parliament as a result of the ability to engage in  private member's business. And if that does mean that there are different issues perhaps to the one  that the major parties would be putting before the Parliament. And obviously as a Government,  we're going to focus on the issues which we want to form the basis of the Government's agenda, but  that there are some different things coming from the side, I think, that's something to be embraced  and certainly we'll do that.

KIERAN GILBERT: Jamie, what do you think? Tony Abbott believes that there should be a greater  focus on bread and butter issues. What do you think about the likes of Bob Brown and others  introducing private member's bills when it comes to issues of conscience like euthanasia?

JAMIE BRIGGS: Look, I agree with Tony Abbott. I think there is much bigger issues for us to be  dealing with. I think, you know, the biggest concern the Australian people have got today is not a bill  dealing with territories' rights for legislation on euthanasia but the claims by the Prime Minister on  the weekend that all bets are off when it comes to her election promises. You've got this amazing  position now where the Prime Minister - because she's won the election clash she doesn't have to  implement all her election promises and in fact all of them are up for negotiation which is quite  extraordinary. We've moved from having fake Julia to real Julia to promises Julia to break promises  Julia all within about six weeks.

KIERAN GILBERT: But Jamie, tell me - you say that there are bigger issues but, you know, for the  families concerned, surely this is one of the biggest issues at play, the biggest issue facing them at  any - you know, at a very difficult time. Isn't this something that the nation's elected representatives  should discuss from time to time?

JAMIE BRIGGS: Well no, this is talking about the issues in relation to the Northern Territory and the  ACT which of course were precluded from having legislation in their territories which is a  Commonwealth's ability to do so. Of course, each state can have legislation dealing with euthanasia  and of course in South Australia at the moment there is a bill before the South Australian Parliament  which is being discussed. So the issue is not in relation - is not whether euthanasia can occur or not.  It's a debate about whether the territories have the right to - for that legislation or not. But my point

is simply this: we have massive debt, what be it through waste and mismanagement from the Labor  party. We still have an insulation program which is a debacle, the school halls program which is a  debacle. We have troops in Afghanistan. We have a mining tax which is going to kill the golden  goose.

So these are much more important issues that we should be debating in the Parliament. And as I say,  we've already got a Prime Minister who's broken several key election promises. Introduction of  carbon tax, on-shore detention for asylum seekers. Key core election promises which she now says  she doesn't need to hold to in this term.

They are much bigger issues to be debating. They're the things that we say we should get on and  debate.

KIERAN GILBERT: Okay, Richard, what's your response to that?

RICHARD MARLES: But Kieran, can I - yeah, if I could [indistinct]. Look, euthanasia is not the issue  that the Labor party would be putting before the Parliament if we got to put - if it was only our  issues that were put before the Parliament. It's not one of our priorities by any means and given  what Jamie said, it's clearly not one of the priorities of the Opposition either. But I think we do live in  a new environment, obviously, with this Parliament where there are going to be things that we are  asked to discuss which are not the number one issue on our agenda or indeed on the agenda of the  Liberal Party. And I think you've got a choice when that happens and that is either to embrace this  new dynamic and to embrace the new issues that are coming before the Parliament which we're  certainly keen to do or you can whinge and whine about it which is what we're hearing Jamie do.  The fact of the matter is, there is hung parliament where…

JAMIE BRIGGS: No, no, I'm whinging and whining that you're walking away from your election  promises, Richard. That's what I'm whinging and whining about.

RICHARD MARLES: Well you're whinging and whining that the debate is not the traditional, you  know, two party debate.

JAMIE BRIGGS: No, no, no.

RICHARD MARLES: Sure, this is not the issue that we would be putting in front of the Parliament but  the fact of the matter is, we now live in an environment where other parties and other independents  within the Parliament can put issues before it and we're going to be asked to discuss and debate  those and we're going to do that in good faith.

KIERAN GILBERT: Okay, Jamie, isn't that true Jamie that in the sense that this would - they're flexing  their muscles at the moment. They've got more seats in the Senate, they've got the breakthrough  win in Melbourne. They'd be doing this anyway even if you did form minority government in the  Coalition.

JAMIE BRIGGS: Well look, the Labor Party's in coalition with the Greens. We know that; they've  signed an agreement. There are all sorts of issues now that the Labor Party and the Greens are at  one on and that they'll pursue in this Parliament. And we still have some interesting questions about  differences in their policy platforms, for instance on the mining tax. How far will the Labor Party go

to placate the Greens on that issue? In relation to a carbon tax which we saw the Prime Minister last  week open back up again even though she promised not to do it in the campaign. And of course on  foreign policy where we have the Greens with extreme views like breaking the American alliance.  These sorts of issues which have still got to be sorted out between the Labor Party and the Greens.  They're a coalition…

KIERAN GILBERT: Would they be introducing…

JAMIE BRIGGS: …partners.

KIERAN GILBERT: The Greens would be introducing their own private member's bills and pushing,  flexing their muscles regardless of who was in minority government, wouldn't they?

JAMIE BRIGGS: Sure, you asked our view on it and my - our view is that this is not a high order issue  to deal with. There are much bigger issues that we should be dealing with as a Parliament when we  have the opportunity to do so.

KIERAN GILBERT: Okay, alright. Gentlemen, appreciate your time as always. We'll catch you in a  couple of weeks. JAMIE BRIGGS and RICHARD MARLES, thanks a lot for that.

JAMIE BRIGGS: Thank you.

KIERAN GILBERT: That's all for this edition of AM Agenda. Join us again at lunch time, 12:30PM for  Lunchtime Agenda. I'm KIERAN GILBERT; thanks for coming in.
