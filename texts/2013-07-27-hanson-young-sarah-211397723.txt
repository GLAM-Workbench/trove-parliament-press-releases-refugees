Statement on Immigration Minister's comments re Manus Island and PNG deal

“Australia’s generous heart is under attack,” the Greens’ immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah  Hanson-Young said today.

“No one believes the conditions in these squalid camps are appropriate. The UNHCR doesn’t,  Amnesty International doesn’t and even the guards who work there don’t.

“The Minster is the only person who thinks the conditions on Manus Island are acceptable, and no  one else believes him.

“No amount of government spin can change the fact that of how cruel and harmful this PNG deal is  for refugees and their children.

“It’s inhumane, it’s dangerous and the government’s push to dump 3,000 refugees on Manus Island  is a humanitarian time bomb.

“The government must guarantee the media and the Australian Human Rights Commission access to  its Manus Island detention camp.”  Thank you,
