FEDERAL MEMBER FOR BLAIR



DUTTON MUST TAKE ACTION TO ENSURE WELFARE OF CHILDREN ON

NAURU AND TAKE UP THE NZ OFFER



Labor is seriously concerned by reports regarding the health and welfare of

children in the Australian-funded regional processing centre on Nauru.



Peter Dutton has been the Minister responsible for Australian-funded regional

processing centres for over three-and-a-half years and must immediately address

his ongoing failures.



Today, Labor has written to Peter Dutton again, urging him to accept New

Zealand's offer to resettle eligible refugees from Manus and Nauru - so that they -

including children - are resettled as quickly as possible.



Nauru and Manus Island were set up as temporary regional processing centres but

have become places of indefinite detention because of the out-of-touch Turnbull

Government’s failure to negotiate other third country resettlement options.



Labor strongly believes that medical transfers for refugees and children in

Australian-funded offshore regional processing centres should be made available

when a treatment is not available on island and where treatment is recommended



by appropriate medical practitioners.



If the Turnbull Government was able to negotiate appropriate conditions for the US

refugee resettlement agreement to prevent people smugglers exploiting vulnerable

people, they should be able to negotiate similar appropriate conditions for any deal

with New Zealand.



It has been sixteen months since the report of the Labor-initiated Senate Inquiry

following the leaked Nauru files and Peter Dutton has failed to act on these

reasonable recommendations to address concerns held by the wider Australian

community.



Peter Dutton’s unwillingness to implement, or even respond to, the

recommendations set out in the report is unreasonable and irresponsible -

especially when it comes to the health and welfare of refugees and children.



If Peter Dutton is too distracted by his leadership ambitions to address his failure to

manage Australian-funded regional processing centres or negotiate other third

country resettlement options, it’s time for Malcolm Turnbull to step in and clean up

his Minister’s mess.
