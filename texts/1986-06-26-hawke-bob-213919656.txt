PRIME MINISTER

CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY

STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER TO PARLIAMENT  ON HIS VISIT TO THE UNITED STATES  19-26 JUNE 1988

It has been my practice to report to Parliament on visits I  have made to overseas countries. Notwithstanding the time  which has elapsed since my visit to the United States from  19 to 26 June,  I believe that the practice is worth

following and I therefore wish to take the first opportunity  available to me to inform Honourable Members about the main  features of this particularly successful visit.

Let me say at the outset that the visit demonstrated that  Australia's relations with the United States have never been  in better shape.  The reception I was accorded as Head of  Government of Australia, and the conversations I had with

individual American leaders, demonstrated both the high  regard in which Australia is held in the United States and  the success which my Government has had in fostering a  creative, mutually advantageous and solidly based ’

relationship. ’

The visit took place at a time when decisions of enormous  importance are being made in world political and economic  affairs. It followed closely upon both the Summit in  Moscow between President Reagan and General Secretary  Gorbachev and the Summit of the seven largest industrialised

countries in Toronto.  It also came at an important phase of  the multilateral trade negotiations as nations prepare for  the Montreal mid-term review. I was able not only to press  Australia's positions on major economic and political events

but also to ascertain from American participants themselves  their views on the most recent developments at the highest  levels of global affairs.

Clearly the highlights of my visit were my talks with  President Reagan and my address to the Joint Meeting of  Congress.

In our talks, President Reagan reaffirmed the importance  which the United States Administration attached to Australia  as an ally and a friend. I fully reciprocated these  sentiments, noting that Australia's alliance with the United

States was a cornerstone of our foreign and defence policy. I took up with the President Australia's concerns on trade

2.

and economic matters and stressed the importance we attach  to fair access to the United States market and fair  competition in the markets of third countries. In this  context I raised our worries over the proposals for the  extension of the export enhancement program and the possible  protectionist implications of the Trade Bill.

As Americans prepare to elect a new President I want to take  this opportunity to pay tribute to President Reagan and the  members of his Administration, particularly Secretary of  State George Shultz, for the leadership which they have

provided to the Western Alliance during their time in  office. The progress which has been achieved on a variety  of world issues, and particularly in the areas of arms  control, has unlocked the door to what may very well be a  new era of peace and cooperation.

It was a signal honour for the Australian Prime Minister to  be invited to address a Joint Meeting of the United States  House of Representatives and the Senate. It was an honour  paid through me to all the people of Australia and  demonstrates the mutual respect which marks the  Australian/United States partnership.

That mutual respect is real, Madam Speaker,  and, in light of  some current media reports,  I want to take this opportunity  to reassert strongly that it is based on our right to define  and defend our own interests. Nobody who heard what I had

to say on my visit to the United States - both in private  discussions and public statements - could think otherwise.

The key principle of this Government in managing our  relations with the United States was set out definitively in  my speech to Congress. It is this: that the test of good  United States/Australian relations is not that as

individuals or governments we should agree on everything. It is rather that we are in accord on matters of basic  principle and that where we disagree we do so with civility  and respect for the other's point of view.

It was on this basis that, for example,  I firmly told the  Congress that Australians must not be given reason to  believe that while we were first class allies we were, in

trade, second class friends.

In Congress, I participated in most useful separate meetings  with groups of senators and congressmen, notably from the  House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee,  the

Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the Trade  Sub-Committee of the Senate Finance Committee. These  discussions covered a broad spectrum of issues, including  protectionism and the United States Trade Bill,  the .Uruguay  Round of trade negotiations, subsidisation of agriculture,

fiscal and budgetary matters,  foreign investment, the South  Pacific Nuclear Free Zone, Indo-Chinese refugees,  burden  sharing in the defence area,  Soviet naval activities in our  region, and our own program of defence cooperation with the  United States.

I was also pleased in Washington to take the opportunity to  have discussions with both the candidates for the United  States Presidency, Vice-President George Bush and Governor  Michael Dukakis. I had excellent discussions with both men

and placed clearly before them Australia's views on  significant global, regional and bilateral issues. Both  candidates stressed the value they place on the US alliance  with Australia. I have no doubt, as a result of my visit,

that, whatever the outcome in November, the incoming US  Administration will have clearly in mind Australia's role as  a constructive, independent and worthy ally.

I was able to have an extremely full program of discussions  with senior figures of the Administration. I renewed my  long-standing friendship with Secretary of State George

Shultz. I met for the first time the new Secretary of  Defense Frank Carlucci. I also had a very informative  discussion with the then Secretary of the Treasury James

Baker. These discussions covered the gamut of world affairs  - strategic, political, economic and financial - and  demonstrated yet again the value of the close and trusted  relationship my Government has established with the American

leadership. Each occasion provided me with the opportunity  to raise the consciousness of US decision makers with  respect to Australia's concerns for free and fair trade in  agriculture.

Apart from my discussions in Washington I also took the  opportunity to make brief but very worthwhile stop-overs in  three other centres of importance in the United States. The  first was Chicago, where I had the pleasure of visiting the  Chicago Mercantile Exchange and meeting there a number of

key figures in the world commodities markets. Since 1   Australia is itself a major commodities exporter this was a  visit of particular significance and interest. I addressed

a luncheon hosted by the Economic Club of Chicago, and took  that occasion to state frankly and clearly Australia's views  on the need for a rational approach to world trade, for  progress on the elimination of subsidies in agriculture and

for the removal of world trade barriers.

In New York I spoke to the annual dinner of the Asia  Society, which on this occasion was a combined function with  the Australian-American Association. This was an occasion  for me to discuss the dynamism of the Asia/Pacific region,

the dramatic changes which have taken place in our part o f ;   the world in the last few years, and the opportunities for  Australia which this growth in the Pacific Rim offers.

I also announced that I had initiated an examination by this  Government of a new step in arms control for the  Asia-Pacific region; namely greater regional effort against  chemical weapons proliferation. ,

4.

Mr Hayden subsequently discussed this idea with Foreign  Ministers of a number of South East Asian countries, and  officials are continuing work on possible options which  could be useful and applicable in our region of the world in

stopping the spread of these abhorrent weapons.

In New York I met with the Secretary-General of the United  Nations Mr Perez de Cuellar.  Our discussions covered the  principal regional conflicts where the United Nations is  actively participating in seeking solutions,  including  Afghanistan, the Iran/Iraq war and Kampuchea. We also

discussed at some length the state of the United Nations  itself.

I met with a group of senior New York banking personalities  to discuss global and bilateral financial matters. I had  another,  and highly productive,  meeting with some of the  most significant business leaders with interests in  Australia to discuss investment opportunities.

My last stop in the mainland United States was in Austin. My major purpose there was to speak at the University of  Texas which, as a Bicentennial project, is establishing an

Australian Studies Center. This is an initiative of  considerable significance because it is the first time that  an American university has created a course of studies,  including at the undergraduate level, entirely devoted to  Australia. I believe that this initiative will lead to a

significant improvement in the knowledge of Australia in the  United States. I paid tribute to the University of Texas  for their farsightedness, their determination and their

enthusiasm in pressing forward with this project. '

In my representations to Americans in both individual  meetings and in speeches to large audiences,  I spelt out the  reforms my Government has implemented to restructure the  Australian economy, to make it more competitive and more

able to participate in the global arena. I drew to their  attention the attractiveness of the Australian economy as a  location for productive American investment and as a base  for dealing with the Asian/Pacific region as a whole.

Both on the way to the United States and on the way back I  profited from brief stop-overs at Pearl Harbour to have  discussions with the Commander-in-Chief of the US Pacific  Forces, CINCPAC, Admiral Ronald Hays. I have seen Admiral

Hays on a number of occasions now and he is a valued friend.  I greatly valued this opportunity to discuss with him a  broad spectrum of regional issues of significance to our two  countries,  including the United States negotiations with the

Philippines over the future of American bases there.  I

I want to assure Honourable Members that wherever I went in  the United States I found an awareness of the contribution  which Australia is making to the alliance and to global  affairs. President Reagan said that he treasured this

relationship. It has been said often before,  but it is  worth saying again, that the mature relationship which

5.

Australia now has with the United States is one which suits  the best interests of both countries: we are close allies but this does not preclude either of us from speaking our  minds and acting in accordance with our independent

judgement. On this occasion I had no hesitation - indeed I  sought out opportunities - to remind Americans of  Australia's concerns about United States agricultural and  trade policies. I stressed our particular concern about

decisions such as the lowering of the acreage reduction rate  in the 1989 wheat program, and the possible extension of the  Export Enhancement Program to Indonesia.

Similarly, I was able to bring to bear our special  perspective as an active participant in regional affairs. At a time of rapid change in our part of the world,  including prospects for greater instability than in the past

in the South Pacific, my visit enabled United States  Government,  Congressional and business leaders to gain a  greater appreciation of Australia, of our policy concerns  and of the importance of the United States/Australia

relationship.
