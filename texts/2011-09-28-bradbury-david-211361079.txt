INTERVIEW WITH KIERAN GILBERT

SKY NEWS AM AGENDA

4 AUGUST 2011

SUBJECTS: NBN, Malaysia deal, Hockey comments on DCCEE, high  speed rail

KIERAN GILBERT:

Joining me this morning on the program is the Parliamentary Secretary to  the Treasurer David Bradbury. David good morning.

DAVID BRADBURY:

Good morning Kieran.

GILBERT:

Also joining us on the program this morning from Melbourne is Shadow  front bencher for Small Business Bruce Billson, good morning. Bruce, what  do you make of Stephen Conroy's argument that the Coalition plan just  doesn't have enough capacity for the future?

BRUCE BILLSON:

Yeah, it's interesting isn't it. I sat through that interview and thought that  if you could sell bluster then the Government's budget deficit would  disappear overnight. There is Senator Conroy talking about blistering  speeds and what the NBN might do, then trying to bring it back to base  rates of cost which have nothing to do with the speeds he's spruiking  about. Of course, he forgot to mention some four years after Labor  promised to revolutionise broadband, you've got 41 households benefitting  from a herculean investment. Malcolm's speech yesterday about the

Coalition broadband strategy was a good speech, it realised that broadband  is delivered over a network of networks, being able to upgrade them as  applications and consumer demand seeks greater performance in greater  capacity is a hallmark of our plan. Also, there is affordability. The point  being that the digital divide is more about the dollar divide, households  without the ready cash to spend handsomely on broadband and other  comms technology are the ones least accessing that capability at the  moment so price matters, and price is something that the Government and  certainly Senator Conroy seems reluctant to talk about, and they continue  to roll out a project that is more expensive than some options that are  available now.

GILBERT:

Okay, David I suppose the other point that Malcolm Turnbull made was  about download speeds, that his alternative could provide 24 megabits per  second capacity as opposed to the 100 megabits per second capacity of the  NBN, isn't that just a more realistic speed? I mean how many households  will actually want much more than that?

BRADBURY:

Well I think Kieran that the first point to make is that Malcolm, what he did  yesterday in his speech, was redefine his job description because we all  know that when he was given the job, Tony Abbott said that he was to  demolish the NBN. What he acknowledged yesterday is that they won't be  demolishing the NBN and in fact they'll be retaining parts of the system  currently in place. But what it was was an attempt to come up with a more  credible policy at least than the Coalition took the last election and we  know what a shemozzle that was. But the bottom line remains that I think  Stephen Conroy made the point very clearly. He made the point that this  would be a bit like building the Sydney Harbour Bridge in the 1920's with  only one lane. I tell you, everywhere I go around the place when people  are stuck in traffic, they lament the fact that politicians didn't take the long  term decisions that were needed by building infrastructure for the future,  and that is exactly what we intend to do with the National Broadband  Network. It's about building in the capacity in to the network that will allow  our economy to grow in to the future. We know from the report that  Google released earlier this week that the Australian economy and its  future prospects are inextricably linked to our ability to access the sort of  capacity that we're building in to the National Broadband Network. Now,  this will be seen as a visionary project once it's been implemented, and in  fact I think by the next election you'll see that the Coalition will have to  recalibrate their policy again, back flip even further, because they know

that more and more Australians will start to experience the benefits of high  speed broadband.

GILBERT:

Bruce Billson what about this idea of future proofing the technology as  David was articulating then?

BILLSON:

He had a dose of analogy overreach there David. The Sydney Harbour  Bridge is a nice, cheesy example. As Malcolm outlined yesterday, the fibre  rolled out already and the fibre being rolled out at the moment provides a  key back bone, to use David's analogy of what Senator Conroy and the  Labor Government wants to have a multi-lane highway in every cul-de-sac  in Bankstown.  It's just ridiculous. The proposition that Malcolm outlined  was fibre to the nodes, utilising existing investment and infrastructure  that's already there, adding further investment in infrastructure where  that's needed in under serviced areas. It gives consumers the power to  choose whether they want a multi-lane highway as their driveway or  whether they'd want something that's fit for purpose for their particular  means and priced accordingly.

GILBERT:

Okay let's put that to David. David, what about that? You upgrade where  you need to. Fibre to the node and the argument about the HFC cable that  it's already in place and people can upgrade where they need to down the  track, it's a more modest spend but with capacity to grow.

BRADBURY:

Well if we want to limit our aspirations as a country to that and if Bruce  doesn't think that people in communities like Bankstown and other suburbs  in Western Sydney should have access to the technology that people have  in other parts of the country then I refute that whole heartedly. I think that  one of the great opportunities that comes with the National Broadband  Network is the opportunity for people all around this country to be able to  change the way they do what they currently do. To ease congestion on our  roads by having people engage in productive economic activity from home,  people working from home, small business in communities like mine who  actually currently don't have access to high speed internet because the  same infrastructure that Malcolm and Bruce want to rely upon, the old out  of date, dated technology, dated infrastructure of the copper wires won't

even deliver high speed internet today yet that is the very infrastructure  upon the Coalitions plan seeks to rely.

GILBERT:

We've got to go to a break I think you've both had a pretty good say on  that. After the break, we're going to look at the issue of the first boat load  of Asylum Seekers to Christmas Island under the Malaysia deal, stay with  us.

*BREAK*

GILBERT:

Welcome back to the program. This morning from Melbourne is Shadow  Small Business Minister Bruce Billson, and from Sydney the Parliamentary  Secretary to the Treasurer David Bradbury. David, today I'm told the first  boatload is expected on Christmas Island around 11-11:30, this is the first

boatload under the Malaysia deal, the Asylum Seeker swap. It's going to be  a tough ask for Immigration Officials to tell these people when they arrive,  'sorry you're not staying, turn around and move on.'

BRADBURY:

I think we can all appreciate that that is not going to be an easy thing to  do.  But, this isn't a policy that was designed to look tough it is in fact a  policy that we are committed to implementing. The reason we're  committed to implementing this policy is that we want there to be a very  clear message not just sent to the people that have arrived but more  particularly to those people that might be waiting in parts of our region and  contemplating spending thousands of dollars, paying a people smuggler to  hop on to one of these leaky vessels and to make the decision to make  that very dangerous voyage across the water towards Australia...

GILBERT:

It's fraud isn't it? This whole scenario because the Prime Minister hasn't  ruled out force being used, but it's not hard to imagine that some of these  people will kick up a stink when they're told what the reality is going to be.

BRADBURY:

I would expect that that is a real likelihood. But, the same would apply if  you were turning boats around in the middle of the ocean and that was  something as far as I understand is still Coalition policy. I think this is

Page 4 of 9 Transcript - NBN, Malaysia deal, Hockey comments on DCCEE, high sp...

28/09/2011 http://parlsec.treasurer.gov.au/DisplayDocs.aspx?doc=transcripts/2011/0...

much less dangerous than that and certainly would expose the Australian  personnel involved to much less risk than that. Clearly, this is not  something that's easy. But, neither was establishing the bilateral  arrangements with Malaysia to put this proposal in place so we're  committed to making it happen.

GILBERT:

Okay let's get Bruce's thoughts on this particularly. Bruce I want to ask  you about the fact that Malaysian Police Officers on the ground as well as  Christmas Island will watch how this is going to work and apparently the  Malaysians want this to start sooner, to get this happening ASAP, people  could be deported as early as this Sunday.

BILLSON:

It'll be interesting to see what will happen in the coming days. There will  be a great deal of interest in how the Government handles this. Not only  interest from our own policy makers and our own citizens but I'm sure the  people smugglers will be very interested as well. They heard back on the  7th of May that any boat that arrived after that would be subject to the  Malaysian solution, well that hasn't been the case. The agreement will be  endorsed by the UNHCR, well that hasn't been the case. The issue about a  72 hour turnaround, well that hasn't been the case either. So, the people  smugglers sitting there wondering what's really going on and they're left  with plenty to sell prospective Asylum Seekers because of the wiggle room  and the uncertainty surrounding the Government's policy...

BRADBURY:

Are you trying to encourage them Bruce?

BILLSON:

I think it'll be interesting to see how this process works out and whether in  fact the Government can implement this policy. There is health and  security checks that I understand will be handled on Christmas Island  involving the Malaysian interest as well, I wonder how that will go. If not  everybody on board the vessel is handled in the same way I'm sure people  will note that as well.

GILBERT:

Okay let's move on. I want to ask you about a couple of other issues  gentlemen. The Shadow Treasurer Joe Hockey said last night on the ABC

Page 5 of 9 Transcript - NBN, Malaysia deal, Hockey comments on DCCEE, high sp...

28/09/2011 http://parlsec.treasurer.gov.au/DisplayDocs.aspx?doc=transcripts/2011/0...

that the Department of Climate Change could be axed under a Coalition  Government. Bruce he said that the Department of Climate Change was  essentially loose with its numbers and that if the Coalition wins they would  look at potentially shutting down the Department of Climate Change. How  would you roll out your own policy without the Department and many of  the public servants working in that area?

BILLSON:

I think 'look at' and 'not having one' are two separate ideas. It's perhaps  an overreach on what Joe was actually saying. He was pointing to example  after example where supposed economic analysis coming out of that  Department had proven to be incorrect based on inaccurate assumptions or  couldn't be validated alongside what Treasury and others were saying  would be the impact of certain policies. So I think Joe's point was quite  valid that the Department of Climate Change should stick to its knitting  and leave the economic analysis and debate surrounding the economic  impact to those agencies within the Commonwealth and others which have  that core competency and can be relied upon to use those numbers  correctly.

GILBERT:

We've got that comment now from Joe Hockey, let's play it for you.

*AUDIO*

JOE HOCKEY:

It's the same Department of Climate Change that has been party to  Treasury modelling where they've modelled the impact of their own carbon  tax at $20 a tonne instead of $23 a tonne. The Department of Climate  Change will be pretty high up the list for very close scrutiny.

HOST:

You mean you'll be thinking of disbanding it?

HOCKEY:

Yep.

*END AUDIO*

GILBERT:

28/09/2011 http://parlsec.treasurer.gov.au/DisplayDocs.aspx?doc=transcripts/2011/0...

So David Bradbury, what do you make of Bruce's comments and also Joe  Hockey's comments that the Department should stick to its area of  expertise.

BRADBURY:

Well I think Bruce should pull his head in. Talking about the Department of  Climate Change sticking to knitting, what an outrageous slur upon public  servants, the people who commit their daily life to trying to contribute to

the public service of this nation. In terms of Joe Hockey's comments, he  was actually referring to Treasury modelling. So if the new approach of the  Coalition is if you don't agree with the advice that you're receiving from the  bureaucracy you shut down the Department, then what is going to be next,  the Treasury? The Treasury for example has given consistent advice to this  Government and previous Governments that the best way to tackle climate  change is by pricing carbon. Now, that will be the advice that a future  Coalition Government if they even get in will receive, what are they going  to do? Shut down the Treasury because they're not getting the advice that  they want? What a joke!

GILBERT:

Okay let's hear Bruce's response to that.

BILLSON:

I just heard David with some confected outrage and Labor is always good  at that.  Joe's point was that the economic analysis and some of the  conclusions that have emanated out of that Department have been proven  to be unreliable. That's a simple, factual statement. The Government refers  to Department of Climate Change's economic conclusions when it suits  them, it skates off over to Treasury when that suits them, basically they  have a policy looking for evidence to back it up. Joe's point and my point is  that at a time when important advice needs to be provided, you should get  that advice from those best placed to provide it. If it's economic analysis,  my sense is the Department of Climate Change should be providing advice  about climate change, and economic advice should be provided by the  economic portfolios.

BRADBURY:

So if you don't like the advice you shut them down?

GILBERT:

28/09/2011 http://parlsec.treasurer.gov.au/DisplayDocs.aspx?doc=transcripts/2011/0...

Okay well let's move on. Last issue I want to touch on is the high-speed  rail report. Anthony Albanese the Infrastructure Minister is going to release  that today, what are your thoughts David? Is this viable, we've only got a  couple of minutes left so a minute or so each on this one, do you think this  is a viable thing in the short term, high speed rail?

BRADBURY:

I think people will very warmly welcome this interim report which will be  handed down, but I think we all acknowledge that there is a lot more work  that will need to be done. I think most people would very clearly see that  there are benefits that would flow from a high speed rail network across  the East Coast. In easy congestion, freeing up capacity at airports and  reducing carbon pollution. I think the question will be its viability as an  economic proposition, but that's something that we as a Government will  work through in the coming year and we're now determined to progress  this interim report to something more substantial upon which Government  will make future decisions.

GILBERT:

Yeah this initial report, Bruce, says that the project could run to as much  as $100 billion. The Government hasn't committed to any spend at all just  yet, it's just a feasibility, what do you think about the idea? Is there scope  to get the private sector in on it as well?

BILLSON:

Look I think there should be and I'd be very keen to see the actual report.  The previous Howard Government initiated a scoping study on this work  and we made an election commitment to do a detailed feasibility, but what  I'm keen to see is how they identify the use of what I call the NIC, the  National Infrastructure Corridor, where one of the uses might be high  speed rail. But then, it's availability for water, gas and other applications,  then how the land use surrounding it is embraced in the economic model.  Regional centres may well have an enormous boost to opportunities  available to them; population settlement may also be a factor. It would be  comprehensive piece of work, and those are the sorts of analysis I'm  looking for in this study where you might see a range of uses and a range  of financing parties to deliver a range of benefits and that is what I'm  hoping the work canvasses.

GILBERT:
