SYRIAN CIVIL WAR 6th ANNIVERSARY



This week marks the 6th anniversary of the start of the Syrian civil war, a tragic  conflict which has now claimed the lives of close to half a million people.

The ongoing humanitarian crisis in Syria has now forced over half of Syria’s pre-conflict population to flee their homes, and left at least 13.5 million Syrians in need  of humanitarian assistance.

This has in turn placed an enormous strain on Syria’s neighbours with millions  of refugees displaced, mainly in Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, Egypt and Iraq.

This unprecedented humanitarian crisis has prompted a massive international  response, with many countries and international aid agencies responding with great  compassion.

Labor urges the Government to continue to work with the international community  towards a long term and sustainable solution in Syria, aimed at stabilising the region  and restoring lasting peace and security for the civilian population.
