Boat people intercepted near Ashmore

Â

Customs Coastwatch today detected and intercepted a vessel believed 
to be  carrying up to 120 suspected illegal immigrants.

Â

The vessel was detected after Coastwatch tasked the 
Customs vessel Botany Bay to patrol waters off north-west Australia.

Â

The detection and interception took place as the vessel 
was nearing Ashmore Islands First reports indicate about 120 people 
on board, although firm numbers will not be determined until the Botany 
Bay escorts the vessel into a lagoon at Ashmore later today. The vessel 
is described as a motorised Indonesian fishing vessel.

Â

It is expected that officials from the Department 
of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs will process the people once 
they arrive on the mainland. Arrangements for the people’s removal 
from Ashmore have yet to be finalised.

Â

It is the second group of boat people detected in 
Australia this month. Last week, six people and two crew arrived at 
Ashmore lslands aboard a motorised Indonesian fishing vessel.
