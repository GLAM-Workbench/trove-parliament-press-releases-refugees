Asylum Seekers and Lord Howe Island

21 January 2002

Tanya Plibersek MP, Federal Member for Sydney and Lord Howe Island, today strongly condemned the Government’s proposal that asylum seekers be temporarily housed at Lord Howe Island.

“Lord Howe Island is a world heritage site with a fragile environment, which is why there is limited accommodation on the island.  Any major building work and increases in population could be detrimental,” Ms Plibersek said.

Ms Plibersek condemned the planned use of Lord Howe Island as a transit home for asylum seekers and promised to campaign for the protection of Lord Howe Island.

“Australia needs to look for real long term solution,  not continue to pursue expensive short term fixes,” Ms Plibersek concluded.
