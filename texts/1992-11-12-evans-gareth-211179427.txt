Emergency assistance for Bhutanese refugees in Nepal

Australia will provide $100,000 to assist southern Bhutanese refugees in Nepal,  the Minister for Foreign Mfairs and Trade, Senator Gareth Evans, announced  today.

Around 65,000 ethnic Nepalese refugees from Bhutan have fled to Nepal to  escape continuing violence in the region and "counter terrorism" by the  government of Bhutan against those seen as actively opposed to its  "Bhutanisation" policy of all ethnic groups in Bhutan.

"With a rate of 350-400 new arrivals per day, the United Nations High  Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) estimates that the refugee population will  exceed 100,000 by the end of this year," Senator Evans said.

Thousands of people are living in poor conditions in refugee camps. The money  we provide will be used for much needed water and sanitation projects.

"The Australian government urges both the government of Nepal and the  government of Bhutan to continue to pursue avenues for a political solution to  this crisis," Senator Evans said.

The funds will be channelled through the Australian office of the Lutheran  World Service which has been assigned to the area by the UNHCR.

Australian emergency assistance for refugees is administered by Australia's  overseas aid agency, AIDAB.  * * * * * *
