Laurie Ferguson  Shadow Minister for Multicultural Affairs







Government inaction sewing the seeds for a future bitter harvest

Laurie Ferguson

Media Statement - 2nd January 2007  Shadow Multicultural Affairs Minister Laurie Ferguson today concurred with comments made by

Professor Jerzy Zubrzycki that the ‘Howard Government has been myopic in its views on

multiculturalism’. Mr Ferguson supported calls for the provision of greater settlement assistance for

new migrants and especially refugees.

“The Howard Government is taking a head in the sand approach on matters of vital national

significance. The successful settlement and integration of new migrants into Australian society is

essential for promoting community wellbeing and enhancing Australia’s successful record on

multiculturalism.

“Labor recognises that some migrants will have particular needs and may require settlement

assistance. It is not surprising that some refugees coming from war torn societies have found it

difficult to integrate into the mainstream community.

“The practice of concentrating large numbers of refugees in some parts of Australia has led to

significant social dysfunction. The fact that very few resources are provided to help in the

settlement of refugees will merely form the basis for long term social problems.

“Labor supports calls for greater resourcing to be provided to refugees and new migrants. Labor

supports a network of Migrant Resource Centres, the provision of adequate English language

programs to new arrivals, maintaining adequate interpreter and translation services, and funding

needs-based settlement services.

“Meeting the challenge of settling and integrating new migrants and refugees into Australia is

essential for enhancing our successful multicultural traditions. Failure to act will merely sew the

seeds of a bitter future harvest
