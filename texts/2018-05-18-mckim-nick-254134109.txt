Amnesty International report on Australia's Manus health crisis

May 18, 2018

Amnesty International's latest report on the inadequate healthcare Australia is providing to  refugees and people seeking asylum on Manus Island is yet another black mark against Peter  Dutton, Greens Immigration spokesperson Nick McKim says.

"There is an ongoing emergency on Manus Island and it is directly because of Dutton's decisions,"  Senator McKim said.

"Dutton's Manus prisoners are suffering mental illnesses at among the highest recorded levels  anywhere in the world."

"These are illnesses that have been caused, or exacerbated, by the appalling conditions Labor and  Liberal governments have put these men under."

"Australia has a legal and moral responsibility to properly care for these men."

"Australia's detention centres on Manus Island and Nauru must be closed, and every detained  man, woman and child brought to Australia so they can receive adequate medical care."
