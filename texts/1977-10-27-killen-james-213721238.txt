.  .  RAAF FINDS REFUGEE BOATS

Another two Vietnamese refugee boats were

located off the north west coast this afternoon by a RAAF

Dakota aircraft during a coastal patrol. ,

The captain of the Dakota,  Flight Lieutenant

Ray Borysewicz, radioed RAAF Darwin at 2.38 p.m. (EST)

and reported there were men,  women and children on

board the vessels.

The two wooden boats,  both about 13 metres long,

were anchored off Lesueur Island, east of Cape Londonderry.

A Navy patrol boat,  HMAS Assail (Lieutenant L.

Walton) was about 70 miles away at the time and was

diverted to investigate. Assail is due to rendezvous

with the refugee boats this evening prior to escorting

them to Darwin. They are expected to arrive at Darwin

tomorrow night or Saturday morning. Â·  .
