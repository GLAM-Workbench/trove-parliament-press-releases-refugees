TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW - ABC AM WITH TONY EASTLEY AND  ALEXANDRA KIRK

SUBJECT: BUDGET

E  & O E - PROOF ONLY

TONY EASTLEY: It appears someone got their sums wrong again. Just two weeks  out from the budget, the Prime Minister will announce later today that revenue will be  $12 billion below the official forecasts for this financial year.

A week ago the Treasurer revealed tax receipts were at least $7.5 billion lower than  Treasury expectations.

Nevertheless, the Government is adamant its new school funding plan and disability  insurance scheme will still go ahead, and they're challenging Tony Abbott to say in  his Budget reply how he'll fund his promises. The Finance Minister Penny Wong told  Alexandra Kirk the nation has to deal with "a new economic reality".

PENNY WONG: Well, as the Prime Minister will make clear today, what we are  estimating is that the write-down in revenue - that is how much less money the  Government is getting for this financial year - will be about $12 billion less than we  anticipated in October. So that's a very substantial write-down.

ALEXANDRA KIRK: Are you talking about a deficit now of around $10 or $11  billion?

PENNY WONG: Look, that's budget speculation and you know the Budget will be  handed down in just over two weeks and we can have the discussion then. But what  I can say to you is that it looks like for this financial year that the Government will be  getting around $12 billion less in tax than we anticipated.

ALEXANDRA KIRK: You're losing about a billion dollars a month in revenue; it's  starting to look like a structural problem, the new norm. Is that correct?

PENNY WONG: Well, there's certainly a new reality, a new economic reality that the

nation has to face and the Government has to face. I'd make the point that in fact in  terms of spending, our spending in the year to date is in fact slightly under what we  anticipated in October, what we do see...

ALEXANDRA KIRK: Even with the big influx of asylum seekers?

PENNY WONG: It is slightly under, in terms of the monthly financial statistics that  I've recently released. What we anticipated; the challenge that the Government and  the country faces is that government is now getting less tax, less money in tax, than  was previously anticipated. And certainly substantially less than John Howard and  Peter Costello.

ALEXANDRA KIRK: How long will it last?

PENNY WONG: Well look, this is a situation where we see write-downs not only in  this year, but we would anticipate seeing significant revenue write-downs in the  years ahead.

ALEXANDRA KIRK: So budget deficits as far as the eye can see?

PENNY WONG: As I said, we're handing the Budget down in a couple of weeks, but  we understand we have to make the right decisions today in this economic climate to  ensure we can invest for tomorrow. And what you can't do is say, well we're just  going to leave aside something as important as disability care - a fair go for all  Australians with a disability. You can't say we're just going to leave aside the  investment in our schools when we know too many young Australians are being left  behind

ALEXANDRA KIRK: How are you going to pay for your Gonski school funding  package and the national disability insurance scheme?

PENNY WONG: Well Alex, I can tell you one thing: unlike Tony Abbot, this  Government will actually be very clear with Australians about choices...

ALEXANDRA KIRK: When?

PENNY WONG: In the Budget we'll be very clear about with Australians about the  choices that have to be made to make these investments, the right investments for  Australia's future.

TONY EASTLEY: The Finance Minister Penny Wong speaking to Alexandra Kirk in   Canberra.
