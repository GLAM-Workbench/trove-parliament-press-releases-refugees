STEVE VIZARD:

Morning Tony.

TONY ABBOTT:

G’day Steve.

STEVE VIZARD:

How are you?

TONY ABBOTT:

I’m good.

STEVE VIZARD:

Now, the polls on the front page of The Australian, Labor in two key states going very  badly, what does this mean for you?

TONY ABBOTT:

It doesn’t alter the fact that it’s going to be very tough to beat the Government later in  the year because it’s a first term government and first term governments don’t  normally lose, but I think Dennis Shanahan is right, I think that the competence of the  Government, the integrity of the Government and even the honour of the Government  is coming under question. Anyone who saw the TV footage of Kevin Rudd going out  to those insulation installers a couple of months ago, taking their names and numbers  and telling them that he got it and then seeing the way the Prime Minister just dudded  them and wouldn’t even face up to the media let alone insulation industry people,  would wonder what kind of a man he really is.

STEVE VIZARD:

The father of Matthew Fuller met with assistant energy efficiency minister Greg  Combet about the scheme, apparently the Prime Minister we learnt last night joined  in, although according to the parents he had little sympathy. Should he have  apologised?

TONY ABBOTT:

Yes, he should have and I’ve made this point before Steve, that the Prime Minister is  only too happy to apologise for wrongs that he had nothing to do with but won’t  apologise for a very serious wrong that he had everything to do with. Now, what’s

clear from that report last night is that public servants in the department knew there  were problems and they’ve passed those warnings up the line. Now, we need to know  how far up the line those warnings went, what action was taken by people further up  the line. The key to this is the letters between Peter Garrett and Kevin Rudd, the four  letters which the Prime Minister has been questioned about in Parliament but refused  to release citing cabinet-in-confidence. Now it’s inconceivable that these letters were  truly part of a cabinet process, so this is a guy who is running at a million miles an  hour and, as I said, the Prime Minister’s integrity and his honour are at stake here and  if he wants to be taken seriously as a man of honour he really should release those  letters and let the public know what he knew and what he did about what he knew.

STEVE VIZARD:

I’m talking to Tony Abbott, Leader of the Opposition. Your man Hunt has called him  a creep. Is that the right word?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, I can understand why Greg feels that way because he’s been dealing very  extensively with the people who have suffered under this program and he knows how  passionately they feel and he knows how badly ripped-off they’ve been and he knows  the tragedies that have flowed from this terrible program, this really terrible program  and the Prime Minister just seems to have no sense of shame about this. No one in the  Government seems to have any sense of shame about this. I mean this is the most

monumentally botched federal government program in memory, it wasn’t just a waste  of money but it killed people. It caused houses to burn down and we’ve currently got  a million home occupiers around Australia who aren’t sure whether their homes are  safe thanks to this appallingly botched program. Now, the Prime Minister said he gets  it, well plainly he doesn’t get it and I think this a terrible problem for a Government  that claims to be responsive to the Australian people.

STEVE VIZARD:

Tony, we’re coming into an election year, we’ve seen the Prime Minister presumably  clearing the decks, we’ve seen the suspension of processing of asylum seekers from  Sri Lanka and Afghanistan, we’ve seen the roof insulation first suspension and now  cancellation, we’ve seen the 220 child care centres that were going to be built now  cancelled, we’ve seen a $14 million inquiry into the building the eduction revolution

scheme. Do you need to do anything? Or do you just sit back and watch? What’s your  tactical strategic position at the moment?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well there are two things that an Opposition has to do. First of all, we have to run a  credible and effective critique of the Government and I think we are doing that.  We’ve also got to come up with credible alternative policy so that people will be  confident that if they elect us Australia will change for the better. Now, we’re in the  process of doing that. We’ve got some policies out there, we’ll have a lot more  policies out there soon, but I reckon that at least some people are coming to the  conclusion that this is a Government which is worse than Whitlam and certainly  Kevin Rudd appears to have all of the inabilities to focus on real problems and deal  with them effectively that we’ve seen in so many of the state governments over the  last few years.

STEVE VIZARD:

Tony, one of the policies that’s been talked about as being developed by you is the  possibility of refusing the dole to the unemployed after six months and banning those  under 30 from the benefits. Tell us about that.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well it’s not a policy. It was just some speculation that emerged from a supposedly  confidential discussion with some business people who were complaining bout the  shortage of labour in Perth. Now, I am totally determined to have a social security  system which encourages people to work not to stay on welfare, but the precise details  of that haven’t been finalised and won’t be finalised for some time, so let’s not make  too much of this idea of limiting the dole for people under 30, but certainly if there is

work available you must take it and our policy will try to ensure that that happens in  practice and not just in theory, and people need to be encouraged by carrots and sticks  to go to where the work is. I mean that’s what the Howard Government did. The Rudd  Government should be doing that. Instead they’re soft on mutual obligation just like  they were soft on border protection. They’re not insisting on job seekers coming into  Centrelink for a gee-up every two weeks and they’re now slowly closing down work  for the dole and that would be an absolute tragedy for jobseekers as well as for the  wider society.

STEVE VIZARD:

I’m talking to Tony Abbott, Leader of the federal Opposition. Access Economics,  Tony, has predicted as a result of the resource boom that the federal and state  governments are going to be the beneficiaries of an extra 12 billion in 2010-2011 and  another 17 billion 2011-2012, so in a sense it’s a resource-led recovery.

TONY ABBOTT:

Sure.

STEVE VIZARD:

Does this to some extent remove economic management of the federal economy or  downgrade it as a key election issue?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, there’s no doubt that the Rudd Government is completely reform-shy and the  Rudd Government is relying on the resources boom to remove the need for it to make  any hard decisions, unlike the Howard Government which made lots of hard decisions  in its first term and which helped set up the current prosperity, unlike the Hawke  Government which made lots of hard decisions in its first term and again we are still  reaping the benefits of those decisions. The Rudd Government hasn’t made any hard

decisions whatsoever and is relying on the resources boom just to bring the Budget  back into surplus. So, I think that’s certainly the case but, you know, that doesn’t  excuse waste of money and I think this is the thing that the public are really focused  on, Steve - the fact that for all their talk of being good economic managers they are  spending like drunken sailors and not getting good value. I mean, people expect the  government to be a prudent steward of tax payers’ money and that’s not what they’ve  got from this mob.

STEVE VIZARD:

Talking to Tony Abbott. The UK election is on at the moment. One of the big issues  there is government transparency and slimming down bureaucracy. We seem to have  seen this burgeoning bureaucracy in Australia. What’s your take on that and what are  you going to do about minimising bureaucracy and giving us more transparency?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, again, I will try to be more like the Howard Government in its best years and  less like the Rudd Government now. I know people say that the Howard Government  lost its way a bit in its last couple of years, I’m not sure how true that is but certainly

in its early years we did trim the bureaucracy significantly, we did cut more than one  per cent of GDP from government outlays in our first year back in 1996 and that’s the  kind of model that we would be looking at, although again precise details you’ll get

nearer the election, Steve.

STEVE VIZARD:

Tony Abbott, reports that Malcolm Turnbull is reconsidering his retirement from  politics. Is that helpful to you?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, it’s Malcolm’s decision and he’s entitled to...

STEVE VIZARD:

He’s entitled to it. I know he’s entitled to do what he wants but is it helpful to you if  he stays on?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I’ve always been in the business of encouraging talented people into the  Parliament not out of the Parliament…

STEVE VIZARD:

And is he one of those on your side?

TONY ABBOTT:

He’s a very capable bloke. Having said all that, he has announced that he’s quitting  and until such time as he makes a further announcement that’s the assumption that  we’ve got to work on.

STEVE VIZARD:

Alright, Storm issue, a couple of quick ones. The Storm issue in Melbourne, two  premierships taken off them, no points. What’s your view about that, is it too big a  penalty?

TONY ABBOTT:

I’m happy to just go with the decision of the NRL here. I don’t claim to be fully  across all the issues. I think I share the public disappointment that there does appear to  have been cheating going on. God knows how widespread it is - I guess this is one of  the issues with the intensive commercialisation of sport, but look, I’m happy to say  that I’ll leave it to the NRL.

STEVE VIZARD:

And Tony, finally, you pulled out of the Bondi swim yesterday. It was pretty tough  conditions, but you’re not suffering from chronic fatigue syndrome or anything, are  you?

TONY ABBOTT:

I didn’t pull out, Steve, it was cancelled.

STEVE VIZARD:

Ah, yes.

TONY ABBOTT:

I have to say I was relieved that it was cancelled because it was an absolute washing  machine out there and I thought to myself, gee whiz, I don’t want to embarrass my  own surf club by having to be rescued in those tough conditions, but…

STEVE VIZARD:

`Cos that footage would never be used again.

TONY ABBOTT:

Ah, absolutely not, never would be used again, but I think there was about 800 of us  waiting on the beach and we were all saved the possibility of that kind of ignominy.

STEVE VIZARD:

Good on you. Tony Abbott, thanks for joining us this morning. Appreciate your time.
