The Shadow Minister for Foreiqn Affairs, Senator Rober~il~  today said the Forei9n Minister, Senate~ must explain  the nature of the modifications made to the Cambodian peace  plan in the past week.

"It has been reported today that the United Nations mili tacy  commander in Cambodia, Lieutenant-General John Sanderson, has  modified the peace-keeping operation.

"This move appears to be a response to the Khmer Rouge's

decision not to co-operate in Sta9e II of the peace process,  which is scheduled to start tomorrow.

"In the paet fortnight, the Khmer Rouge has significantly  increased its efforts to undermine the peace processÃ¢Â‘ Ã¢Â‘ -QÃ¢ÂÂ¢s I - Ã¢Â‘ Ã¢Â‘ ~  CONTINUIRG ite heavy artillery attack on Government forces  in the province of Preah Vihear1

LAYING mines along the Thai border;

REFUSING the UN access to areas under Khmer Rouge control;

SHELLING Government positions while UN troops are visiting;  and

DKMARDING that the UN verifies the removal of all  Vietnamese troops.

"Any modification of the Cambodian peace process is a very  significant development.  "But we have so far been given no details about the changes.

"In line with the Prime Minister's promise that the Australian  Government would keep the Parliament and the public informed  about developments in Cambodia, Senator Evans should now  explain the nature of the changes to the peace plan.

"U nfortunately, Senator Evans has confused rather than  clarified the Cambodian situation in the past few days .

"For example, Senator Evans on Wednesday said the Cambodian  peace process was headinq for a 'major stumble'.

"But later that day he backed away from this and said that  what was happeninq on the ground in Cambodia was more in the  'nature of huff and puff' by the Khmer Rouge.  "This claim conflicts with statements by the head of UNTAC, Mr  Akashi, that the Khmer Rouqe's intransigence constituted 'a  clear breach of the Paris agreement and is therefore extremely

unacceptable'.

"Apart from the nature of General Sanderson's modifications,  Senator Evans should also explain&

THE role now envisaged for the Khmer Rouge in the peace  process;

HOW the UN intends to deal with a fully armed Khmer Rouge  determined to exclude the UN from areas under Khmer Rouge  control;  WHY there are only 9000 UN troops currently in C~dia

after tellinq the Senate on May 6 that there would be  11,450 in the country by June 2, in line with the original  UN target of 15,900 by July;

WHA~ progress has been made on mine clearance given that

the Khmer Rouge is continuinq to lay mines;  HOW the UN will resettle 370,000 Cambodian refugees by  April next year given that only 6000 have been  resettled so far and that the target of 10,000 a week is

not being met;

HOW the UN will address the issue of Vietnamese settlers in  Cambodia; and

HOW far the UN has progressed in taking over the functions  of government as outlined in the Paris Agreement.
