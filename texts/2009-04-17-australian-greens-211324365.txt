New asylum seekers should be taken to mainland:  Greens





The Australian Greens have called for future asylum seekers arriving by boat to be taken to the  Australian mainland by the most direct route, ending the policy of successive Australian  Governments to process asylum claims on remote islands.

Greens Spokesperson on Immigration, Senator Hanson-Young, said the moment asylum seekers  were contacted by Australian security personnel marked the start of Australia's duty of care for the  health and safety of the arrivees.

"From that moment, arrivees should be taken to the Australian mainland as quickly as possible  where they can be removed from danger and given medical attention."

"Humanitarianism is a fundamental Australian value  Ã¯Â¿Â½ it is one of the great attributes we cherish as  Australians."

"Sadly we have allowed hysteria and prejudice on the part of some politicians and commentators to  drive more than a decade of immigration policy down the wrong track."

"It's time Government policy reflected Australia's fundamental humanitarianism and support for  human rights."  Senator Hanson-Young said that with another boat of asylum seekers now expected to be contacted  by Australian security personnel in the next few days, and the world-wide increase in refugee  movements generally, a full review of immigration policy should be initiated by the Government.

"We should be seeing this issue through a humanitarian lens rather than a punitive approach."

"Australia must recognise that the last leg of the journey of refugees who arrive by boat is harrowing  and fraught with danger and risk."

"It makes no sense to transport arrivees back across hundreds of kilometres of ocean to Christmas  Island for example  Ã¯Â¿Â½ further putting lives at risk."

"The Government must act to ensure that the potential for the loss of human life is minimised, and  arrivees are taken by the most direct route to the Australian mainland where their claims for asylum  can be assessed."
