Senator Andrew Bartlett   Leader of the Australian Democrats     July 2, 2003                   MEDIA RELEASE                                    03/481



Boatpeople Must Be Independently Assessed

The boatload of suspected asylum seekers intercepted off the West Australian coast and currently  being sent to the Christmas Island detention centre must have access to the full and proper processes  to determine their refugee status, the Australian Democrats said today.

Democrats’ Leader, Senator Andrew Bartlett, said the boatload of more than 50 people must be  independently assessed to determine whether they are genuine refugees.

“We simply cannot have people, including the Minister and Immigration Department officials,  suggesting that these people are not genuine refugees before that process has been completed,”  Senator Bartlett said.

“To pre-judge these people or the situation from which they have fled is a gross distortion of the  process.”

Senator Bartlett, as a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration, will travel to  Christmas Island on Friday.

Senator Bartlett said the trip is expected to co-incide with the arrival of the suspected asylum  seekers who were intercepted yesterday near Port Hedland, off the north coast of Western Australia.

“We would hope to talk with representatives of the group.  They will be interviewed at Christmas  Island to find out who they are, where they are from and their reason for coming to Australia.

“These people must be given access to the proper process to determine their refugee status.

“For it to be publicly suggested that they are opportunists who chose to make such a hazardous  journey without a very good reason completely undermines the process.”
