FOTREIGN AFFAIRS MINISTER JULIE BISHOP

Japan National Press Club

Speech, E&OE, (check against delivery)

15 October 2013

Introduction

It's an honour to address the Japan National Press Club on my first visit to Tokyo as

Australia's new Foreign Minister — as I wished to visit Japan very early in my term —

indeed it is less than 4 weeks since I took up this role. Our national election was held on

7 September — the same day Tokyo was given rights to host the 2020 summer

Olympics, so an auspicious date for us both!

I'm also very pleased to have an opportunity, later today, to meet with Prime Minister Abe and with Foreign Minister Kishida,

The Foreign Minister and I hope to build on the productive meetings we have already

held in the past month during the UN General Assembly in New York and in the margins

of APEC in Bali.

Today I will talk about:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ the partnership between our two countries,

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ the importance of our economic relationship, and

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ building the regional and the international order, on open, rules-based principles.

No nation has been more important to Australia finding its place in Asia than Japan.

Economics and trade have been, throughout our history together, a keystone of our

bilateral relations.

They aren't the whole story — as our shared values and increasing security and

strategic collaboration attest.

But they will remain central to our efforts to further deepen our friendship, and to our

mutual success in coming decades.

Our foreign policy approach in government will be one that puts economic diplomacy

first;

Putting our international assets, including our foreign policy and our international

network, to work for the benefit of Australia's long-term economic prosperity;

Keeping economic reform and trade liberalisation foremost in our minds;

Supporting open, transparent, rules-based trading systems;

Pursuing an ambitious free trade agenda;

Supporting a vibrant business sector, both at home and abroad;

And working for closer ties to Asia.

We will pursue 'economic diplomacy' not as an end in itself — but because prosperity —

along with spreading democracy and the application of the rule of law — has been a vital

support for the peace our region has enjoyed for nearly 70 years.

For Australia puts the highest priority on global economic reform and trade liberalisation,

as a key way of securing jobs and economic growth.

But first let me begin with some history.

In January 1950, shortly after a new Coalition Government under Sir Robert Menzies had been elected to office, Australia's then Foreign Minister, Sir Percy Spender, spoke of

the foreign policy approach that Australia would adopt in the post-war era, and I quote:

''Geographically Australia is next door to Asia and our destiny as a nation is irrevocably

conditioned by what takes place in Asia. This means that our future depends to an ever

increasing degree upon the stability of our Asian neighbours, upon the economic well-being of Asian people, and upon the development of understanding and friendly relations

between Australia and Asia. Whilst it remains true that peace is indivisible, and that what

takes place in any part of the world may affect us, our vital interests are closer to home.

It is therefore in Asia and the Pacific that Australia should make its primary effort in the

field of foreign relations'', 63 years on and I feel I can adopt that statement as my own.

The Commerce Agreement

It was in 1957 that this foreign policy found expression in an historic Commerce Agreement, signed by Australia and Japan.

While it wasn't the first time we'd paid attention to improving trade relations between

Australia and Japan, as we'd had trade missions here at least as far back as the 1930s,

2

it was an extraordinarily significant achievement between two countries who had been at

war just over a decade earlier.

In 1957, the Australian Prime Minister was still Sir Robert Menzies.

The Japanese Prime Minister was Nobusuke Kishi.

Kishi was — as everyone here knows — the grandfather of Prime Minister Abe.

While no one in our new Coalition Government can claim to be Sir Robert Menzies'

grandchild, perhaps we could get away with calling ourselves his spiritual god-children,

such is his influence as the founder of our Liberal Party almost 70 years ago.

At the time of the signing of the Commerce Agreement my predecessor as Foreign

Minister was Richard Casey — he had been Australia's first Ambassador to Washington,

in 1939, and later was appointed Australia's Governor-General.

After a visit to Japan in 1959, a couple of years after the Commerce Agreement was

signed, Richard Casey reflected on the future of the Australia-Japan relationship in a

letter to a ministerial colleague.

His words were profound: as he wrote;

I came away from Japan with an acute realization of the importance of trade relations

within our overall relations with that country.

I believe that the goodwill shown on both sides and the business like administration of

the Trade Treaty have contributed much to the steady improvement in general relations.

Indeed, I would not wish to minimize the value of this favourable trade climate for

enhancing cooperation and understanding in other fields...

I think there is an awareness that Japan's interests as a trading and shipping nation ...

can best be served by her belonging to the community of nations pursuing multilateral

trade policies.

His reflections are as true today as they were in the late 1950s, so allow me to apply his

themes to our current circumstances.

Australia and Japan in an evolving Asia

First, Casey wrote of the importance of trade within the broader context of bilateral

relations — so true.

3

Trade has been, for Australia, a vital stepping stone in building relationships with Asia.

Long before it became a modern nation in 1901, Australia had struggled to find its place in this region.

Our origins, as a nation, lay on the other side of the world, in the European age of

empire-building.

Our culture was blended - a transplantation of British culture in an ancient land with an

ancient people which has lasted for tens of thousands of years. Waves of migration over

generations added further diversity to our population.

And our geography brought its own uniqueness — an island continent that is part of

Asia, yet also a discrete physical entity in its own right.

While we debated where we stood in the world, our economic strengths were clear: in

agriculture, in mining, in resources, for Australia had raw materials that were vital for the

economic transformation taking place in countries including Japan,

For Australia, grappling with the immense diversity among the Asian cultures to our

north, began with trade.

We understood the keystone to building deep, lasting, broad-based relationships with

our neighbours in Asia was establishing economic and trade ties.

And Japan was the first.

In the years leading up to and following the Commerce Agreement, Japan's economic

transformation began to fundamentally redraw the lines of power in the world.

The effect of Japan's rise in the 1950s and 1960s flowed throughout the region — and

ultimately throughout the globe.

That process continued through the other Asian economic miracles of the second half of

the 20th Century — Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, and Korea.

And it continues today, through the re-emergence of China and India to the top rung of

nations in the international order a position they had held a couple of centuries ago.

4

We can trace the success of Australia's modern economy to that Commerce Agreement

of 1957. Australia's trade relationship with Japan has indeed flourished since the

Commerce Agreement was signed and Japan's industrialisation took place.

For decades, Japan was our largest trading partner and today Japan remains our

second-largest trading partner, with $71 billion traded between us in 2012.

We are Japan's third-largest source of merchandise imports,

and Japan's largest supplier of primary energy.

We are a reliable source of safe and clean food, and a welcoming destination for

investment from Japan, our third largest investor after the US and the UK.

Japan is far and away Australia's largest source of Asian capital.

As we enter the second decade of the 21st Century, Australia wants to continue to

deepen and broaden our economic and personal ties, and our integration with and

understanding of Asia.

One of the Abbott Government's signature policies is what we call the New Colombo

Plan — a reference to the Colombo Plan that began in the 1950s under the Menzies Government.

That scheme brought over 40,000 students from the region to study in Australian

institutions between the 1950s and 1980s.

In reviving the spirit of the Colombo Plan, we propose to offer Australian university

students the opportunity to study in Asian universities, and undertake internships with

companies doing business in the host country.

Sending our young people into the region will build our Asia literacy, boost our

innovation, and build ties with the regional leaders of the future.

I very much hope that Japan, our closest partner in the region, will be involved in the

pilot phase of the New Colombo Plan in 2014.

Our aim is to see increasing numbers of Australians studying in Japan — which 1 hope will also support Prime Minister Abe's goal of doubling the number of foreign students in

Japan by 2020.

5

Already our Prime Ministers have discussed the initiative and I will discuss the details

with Minister Kishida when we meet later today.

Wider cooperation — security

Back to Richard Casey's 1959 observations -

He predicted that our ''favourable trade climate" would serve as an incubator for

cooperation in other fields, and wider understanding.

Such prescience for that prediction has come to pass.

Today we are very comfortable with the growing defence and security co-operation

between our two countries.

This has fast become one of the pillars of our bilateral relationship and is an area we are

keen to strengthen further.

We cooperate more deeply on security and defence because — as we have learnt more

about each other and become strong friends — we have recognised how much we share

values and strategic interests.

At the opposite poles of the Asian region, we share a deep commitment to democracy,

to the rule of law, to human rights and to peaceful coexistence.

And we recognise that our defence capabilities are complementary;

That, as allies of the United States, we have mutually supportive roles to play in the

security of the region. The closeness of our security ties was most recently reflected in

the Trilateral Strategic Dialogue held in Bali on October 4, during which Secretary Kerry,

Foreign Minister Kishida and I discussed current and emerging issues of global and

regional concern to the US, Japan and Australia.

In 2007 Prime Minister Abe and Prime Minister Howard signed the Australia-Japan Joint Declaration on Security Cooperation - which provides for wide-ranging cooperation in

peacekeeping, on humanitarian operations, in counter-terrorism and law enforcement.

That declaration also established a 2+2 meeting of foreign and defence ministers — and

Australia remains one of only a handful of countries to hold such meetings with Japan.

6

Our defence forces have worked closely together: in Iraq, East Timor, Pakistan,

Cambodia, South Sudan — and here in Japan in the wake of the Great East Japan

Earthquake and tsunami.

Australia was the only country other than the United States to provide strategic airlift

capability to the Self-Defence Force in Japan — a measure of just how close our

defence relationship has become.

Against this background, we look forward to Japan making a greater contribution to

security in our region and beyond — including through our alliances with the United

States.

We support Japan's plan to work towards a more normal defence posture to help it play

that greater role.

The next step in strengthening the bilateral relationship is to conclude the bilateral ETA.

After six years of discussion, it is time to seal the deal.

This will take our relationship to the next level.

It must be an outcome that delivers commercially meaningful results for both countries

and be mutually beneficial.

I believe both sides are ready to be ambitious and pragmatic, because we know that a

deal makes economic sense for both of us.

The bottom line is an ETA would strengthen the relationship, make trade both ways

more efficient and profitable, give more options for consumers and support Japan's

security of supply.

With his family's links to the origins of the modern Australia-Japan relationship, it was

wholly fitting that it was Prime Minister Abe who committed Japan to free trade

negotiations with Australia.

It would be even more fitting if it were Prime Minister Abe who concluded them.

Economic reform

Turning again to Richard Casey's remarks, he pointed to Japan's interest in "belonging

to the community of nations pursuing multilateral trade policies'',

The pursuit of multilateral reform benefits all nations.

That is a truth that applies to Australia, and every other nation in our region.

Indeed, the transformation in our region since the 1950s— led by Japan, but also

underpinned by the presence of the United States — has proven the value for all nations

in pursuing economic reform and trade liberalisation.

I believe Australia's long-term priority is intrinsically tied to our success in growing and improving our economy,

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ in making ourselves more competitive,

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ in being smarter and more innovative,

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ in making it easier for Australian businesses to access markets,

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ and in attracting foreign investment.

The Abbott Government is committed to improving even further Australia's attractiveness

as a business destination.

We hope to make it easier to do business in Australia, not harder.

We will abolish the mineral resource rent tax and the carbon tax.

We will cut red tape costs by $1 billion each and every year.

And we will cut "green tape" around major projects.

We will set aside at least two days in each Parliamentary year to do nothing but repeal

unnecessary legislation and regulation. I feel sure we'll be able to sell tickets to our

'Repeal Days'!

We are watching with great interest the progress of the Japanese Government's efforts

to revitalise Japan's economy.

The whole world has a stake in Abenomics.

A healthy and vibrant Japanese economy is important not only for the people of Japan, it

is an international public good.

8

We welcome the vision shown in Prime Minister Abe's announcement in April of Japan's

decision to join the Trans-Pacific Partnership.

That was a bold decision — and if the TPP can be realised, its effect will flow throughout

the region and provide the necessary momentum for global trade liberalisation.

The revitalisation of Japan's economy will face hurdles from within and without.

Japan is an integral part of the global economy and there will be challenges.

Australia wants to be an active partner for Japan as it continues on the path to change.

Community of nations

Finally, Richard Casey spoke of the idea of the "community of nations''.

I found that a striking concept for the 1950s — and deeply relevant to our world today.

It is a reminder of our common interest our global common interest.

It is true that Japan and Australia's strategic interests are aligned.

We have shared purposes in providing humanitarian and disaster relief, in nuclear non-proliferation, in cyber security, space and counter-terrorism.

But more fundamentally, we have an interest in a stable, predictable, rules-based order

— both around the world, and specifically in Asia.

Regional institutions — particularly the East Asia Summit — are central to our efforts to

preserve the peace that has underpinned our prosperity.

That is why Australia wants to continue working with Japan to strengthen the East Asia

Summit as the premier regional forum, which has the right membership and mandate for

our region.

The recent summit in Brunei showed the value of the EAS as the key forum for leaders

to discuss regional security, and shared challenges like food security and disaster relief.

Australia and Japan share a clear-sighted understanding of the role of financial and

economic integration in regional stability and prosperity.

That is why the annual APEC leaders' summit in Bali and the EAS finance ministers

meeting in Washington are so important.

Our regional cooperation also extends to a close partnership in global multilateral

institutions -

In the United Nations, in the World Trade Organization, in the G20.

Even as we look to finalise our ETA and the TPP, both our countries remain deeply

committed to multilateral approaches — and we will not waver in our efforts to bring the

Doha Round closer to some resolution.

Like Japan, we are active participants in the United Nations, which is important to

continuing efforts to strengthen the international rules-based order.

Australia is committed to contributing constructively to the Security Council's agenda,

and we thank Japan for its support.

As a member, we are engaging with Japan on our shared interests in addressing the

most pressing challenges to international peace and security, particularly in our own region.

We note the Council's timely and robust response to North Korea's provocations this

year, and we will continue to work with Japan to ensure the Security Council remains

focused on combating this threat.

We support broad reform of the United Nations, and we would like to see Japan have a

permanent seat on the Security Council.

The development of the G20 is a further example of how Australia and Japan have

worked together to shape regional and global institutions — even as the globe grappled

with the dysfunction of the financial crisis of 2008.

No other group available to the global community today has the same balance in terms

of a broad and relevant representation, along with the ability to move quickly and nimbly

against the challenges facing the global economy.

The G20 proved its worth during the financial crisis.

But if the importance of its work at other times — outside of an immediate economic or

financial crisis — is not sufficiently recognised, then both Japan and Australia must play

an important role in ensuring the G20 remains dynamic and relevant.

10

In November next year, Australia will use our hosting of the G20 summit to seek to bring

about global consensus on trade liberalisation and broader economic reform.

Conclusion

Japan and Australia are vital partners in Asia.

Ours is a partnership — and a friendship that has deepened and matured as each decade has passed.

There are few countries that have more to offer each other than Australia and Japan —

in trade, in education, in cultural exchanges and in the pursuit of peace and prosperity.

I believe that the best days of our relationship lie ahead, as we work together to build a

strong, stable regional and global order.

The Hon Julie Bishop MP

Minister for Foreign Affairs

17 October 2013

QUESTIONS AT THE NATIONAL PRESS CLUB TOKYO

Subjects: US pivot and force posture, Trans Pacific Partnership, Trilateral Security Dialogue, whaling, East China Sea, Australian bilateral relations with Japan and China, Free Trade Agreements, New Colombo Plan, India, Indian Ocean Rim Association for Region Cooperation (10R ARC), refugees and immigration.

QUESTION Your presentation touched upon the trade, the security, and other very broad-ranging topics. Roles of Japan and Australia will even become larger. I think that was indicated in your presentation. But as Minister mention in your speech, this month in South East Asia there were some East Asian-related or APEC-related meetings, or TPP-related meetings. The Summit-level meetings

were held this month President Obama was not able to make himself available because of his domestic fiscal problems. So he was absent from these meetings. In terms of security in relation to China, we will have to manage our relationship with China That will require strong presence and a strong engagement commitment of the United States. However, in this arena as well, President Obama's international involvement, especially on questions like Syria as the backdrop, we question

how much we can expect of his leadership in international arena So, Honourable Minister, viewed from Australia, the American commitment to Asia, especially President Obama's commitment in Asia — how do you read that? Some critics say, verbally of course, President can talk about strengthen the commitment, but as a matter of reality, action and deeds do not accompany his words. Some critics criticise in this way. So on this point, can you talk about your idea.

JULIE BISHOP Thank you for the question

It was unfortunate that President Obama was not able to be at the APEC Leaders' Meeting in Bali and at the East Asia Summit Forum in Brunei However, I don't think it came as a surprise to any of the participants that his priority lay in remaining in Washington at that time because of the domestic issue of the government shutdown. So I think we would have been astounded had he been able to leave Washington and attend the meetings in Asia.

Secretary Kerry represented President Obama at the various meetings, and as far as I am aware, laid out the United States' agenda when it comes to its rebalancing, as it calls it, of its interests and focus on our region, I believe that the actions that we were looking for will manifest in the TPP, the Trans-Pacific Partnership. If that is able to be concluded within the timeframe set by the participants — that

is, by the end of 2013 That will be a remarkable achievement and will certainly give much weight to the United States to be focussing its economic interests and, more broadly, its strategic and security interests in our region.

So there is a great deal of enthusiasm for the conclusion of the Trans-Pacific Partnership.

Likewise, the United States has shown its desire to take a leadership role, continue to take a leadership role, in our region when it comes to our security concerns. As you will be aware, Australia has expanded the joint operations under the ANZUS Alliance with more American troops rotating through Darwin An agreement that was reached a couple of years ago And we're seeing that playing out on the ground in Australia now.

As I talk to countries in our region, my impression is that, in the main, they are seeking more

leadership from the United States in our region, not less. And through the deepening of its strategic relationship with Japan, as evidenced by Secretary Kerry's visit here recently. The deepening of the relationship with Australia, as evidenced through the Force Posture circumstances. Its relationship with the Philippines, with Singapore, with the ASEAN countries more generally, as well as its close economic engagement with China. I think it's apparent that the United States is focussing its efforts on our region, and that it will continue to do so, notwithstanding the domestic challenges it currently faces.

So, with the conclusion of the TPP, with increased security discussions and agreements, the US presence will be very much felt.

And I participated in the Trilateral Strategic Dialogue — the United States, Japan and Australia — and Secretary Kerry was deeply engaged in the discussion we held about the challenges facing the region, some of the global challenges as the published communique will attest. It was a case of three close friends talking about issues of mutual concern.

So I believe that the unfortunate circumstances preventing President Obama being in the region should not be read as anything more than a clash of priorities But we will see the expression of the rebalancing through the TPP and through other strategic and security arrangements. Not only now, but into the future.

QUESTION From Labor Party it has changed to the conservative Coalition Look from Japan, what we would like to focus our attention on is — what may be the relationship with China going forward, including security as well as trade? Will there be any change from the previous Administration? Under the Labor Government Australia-China relationship has deepened. On the

other hand, in terms of security, there have been few setbacks, is what we have been told. So under the new Coalition Government — what may be the changes to come, please?

JULIE BISHOP In general terms, the new Australian Government wishes to deepen and broaden all our relations in the region because we believe that its through economic engagement, the people-to-people links of relations built on mutual trust and respect, that we can more likely guarantee peace and security in this region.

China is now our major trading partner in terms of merchandise. Japan remains our second-largest trading partner, but our major investor from Asia.

So our relationship with China is important from an economic point of view, and we recognise that China's economic engagement in the region we are not the only country that now has China as our number one trading partner — many other countries are in the same position. But China's economic engagement can help to expand trade opportunities and improve opportunities for countries to link

into the global economy.

We welcome China's peaceful rise. We want to encourage China to be part of the global community, the rules-based international community. So, in terms of our relationship with China, we hope that it will be based on mutual respect We hope that, as with other countries, we can adopt a "no surprises"

approach. One of the criticisms of the former government was that it took unilateral decisions without sufficient consultation. We do not wish to be accused of that, and wish to be a consultative, collaborative partner.

We believe that the more China is engaged in the region — economically, strategically — the better it will be for us all. I know there are concerns in some areas about China's increasing assertiveness,

Parliament House, Canberra ACT 2600 Ph: 02 6277 7500 Fax: 02 6277 4112

but I believe we should be encouraging China to be a responsible regional and global player. And I

think that both Japan and Australia have a significant role to play in that regard.

QUESTION Thank you Minister. Rick Wallace from The Australian newspaper. Just two quick questions. I notice that in your speech you mentioned that you support Japan shifting to I think you said was a more normal defence posture. Just wondering if you could define that a bit more closely, and does that extend to the changes to the Constitution that Mr Abe is seeking And second, it's

probably a related question, I wanted to ask you if you think it's possible for Australia to keep pursuing what I'll call a Japan first foreign policy, in terms of nominating Japan as the closest friend in Asia and inviting Mr Abe to Australia to address Parliament, without damaging the China relationship And in asking you that I point out obviously that they seem to have taken umbrage at the wording that came out of the Trilateral Dialogue with Mr Kerry and Mr Kishida, accusing Australia and the US of ganging

up on it in relation to its territorial interests. Thank you.

JULIE BISHOP Just on the last first. I have also had meetings with Chinese officials, and explained that the Trilateral Strategic Dialogue is not aimed at any country, that it didn't represent a change in Australia's position at all In fact our view on the East China Sea issue has been long-standing That is, we don't take sides on territorial disputes, but we certainly don't support coercive or unilateral action in the resolution of such disputes And that was what was expressed in the communique which

is long-standing Australian policy.

In relation to the China-Japan question, I think that we can't deny our history, nor should we. Australia and Japan have been long-standing trading partners for almost 70 years, as I was at pains to point out in my speech. And it's not a relationship that should be ignored or taken for granted It is a significant part of the Australian economy that we have today. Our standard of living, our economic growth has much to do with the foundation-stone put in place by that Commerce Agreement of 1957.

So there's no changing history in that regard But like many other countries, we recognise China's growth, and we are taking the opportunity to provide China with many of the raw materials that it requires, as we did with Japan in the 50s and 60s. The raw materials that China requires for its growth and its industrialisation. So we believe that Australia can manage its relations in the region by being open and frank. By respecting the differences we have with other countries.

But it is a fact that Australia and Japan share a similar political system. We share similar outlooks and attitudes on many regional and global issues. We are democracies. We are committed to the same democratic institutions and values, and freedoms. And so, having so much in common, it's not surprising that we should describe Japan as our best friend in Asia. Not only just say it, but mean it.

But that's not to deny that we will continue to work on our relationship with China. As we will with our relationship with South Korea And I think we'll be deft enough with the appropriate political leadership: to be able to manage our various relationships in a positive and constructive way.

As far as Japan's focus on collective defence, we support the direction set out by Prime Minister Abe that Japan can take a greater role in collective security and we welcome the steps that are being undertaken to ensure that it can undertake that role. We work in partnership with Japan in many locations around the world, and if Japan is in a position to be part of our collective defence and

security arrangements then I believe that that will be for the betterment not only for Australia, but the region and globe.

QUESTION On TPP, as well as IFTA], the ruling party, the Government, the LDP, is saying for the sensitive agricultural products — for those products for which not much impact may be seen They have started consideration on the tariffs levels So what is your assessment on this? Australian Government. are you also thinking to make compromise, for instance, abolition of tariffs on

Parliament House, Canberra ACT 2600 Ph: 02 6277 7500 Fax: 02 6277 4112

3

automotive products for example. If I may ask a separate question about the whaling issue. A new

government in Australia, for the scientific-based whaling activities, and also Sea Shepherd, the NGO in Australia, that there could be some collision between the two in the Antarctic Sea. And I understand that Customs vessels may be sent. Is it to pressure Japan? Or is it to try to prevent any collision between the two parties?

JULIE BISHOP In relation to your question on the Free Trade Agreement. Both sides are working very hard to deliver an outcome that will benefit both our countries. We enter into trade negotiations on the basis that the negotiated outcome will benefit both countries, And that means that there will be compromises for both countries, But after seven years of negotiations I believe that we are very close to a bilateral deal that will deliver the economic benefits that both our countries are seeking And overall, a Free Trade Agreement between Australia and Japan will take our bilateral

relationship to a new level.

We are currently finalising the market access package. And of course there are sensitivities. Its no surprise that agricultural market access for our key products is a priority for Australia. It's no surprise that Japan has an interest in cars and on investment. I believe that with the political will and the leadership already demonstrated by Prime Minister Abbott and Prime Minister Abe in their discussions

in Brunei and in APEC, that we can be ambitious We will be pragmatic and we do have the political leadership and the political will to conclude an agreement.

We have concluded Free Trade Agreements with a number of other countries, and they have been overall of benefit to both countries. And where we fail to conclude a Free Trade Agreement and yet competitor economies are able to, we lose market share And we've seen that recently with the United States and South Korea Free Trade Agreement. Australian beef producers are losing out to our American competitors,

So there are opportunities for both Japan and Australia that are not to be missed, and I'm confident that we will be able to conclude a mutually-beneficial Free Trade Agreement in the months ahead.

In relation to the whaling issue. As you would be well aware, there is a court determination to be handed down at some point, and so I won't comment further, except to assure you that we will respect the court's decision in that regard, as I understand Japan will And most certainly the Australian Government is very determined not to let our differences over whaling harm our relations with Japan.

As for the Sea Shepherd's activities. We do not, and will never, condone reckless, dangerous, unlawful behaviour. And where it occurs on the high seas, we will unreservedly condemn it. The fact that the Sea Shepherd visits Australian ports or some of the Sea Shepherd fleet might be registered in Australia is not indicative in any way of the Australian Government's support for the organisation. And we will continue to comply fully with our international legal obligations with regard to safety at sea.

As the whaling season is upon us, we will make a judgement at the time as to what is necessary.

As for sending Australian vessels or Customs vessels, we will make that decision at the time. But it is to ensure that there is no risk to life, to ensure there is not any outcome that would see people harmed, or lives lost in some sort of outcome between the Sea Shepherd and the Japanese whaling boats. So it's not a question of intervening. It's a question of ensuring that our presence can lead to

some appropriate behaviour. But I can assure you we will not be supporting any reckless, dangerous behaviour.

QUESTION I have a question about New Colombo Plan. Australia originally is a popular destination On the other hand, internationally there is a fierce competition for securing human resources. Tokyo is eclipsed by Shanghai for example, In this context what is the strength and

Parliament House, Canberra ACT 2600 Ph: 02 6277 7500 Fax: 02 6277 4112

4

advantage that Australia has? What will be the appealing point medium to long term? Shall human

resources stay in Australia? Is that what you are expecting, what you are hoping for?

JULIE BISHOP Australia is already a popular destination for international students. We have hundreds of thousands of students coming to Australia every year to study in our universities and our institutions.

The New Colombo Plan is designed to send Australian students in reverse back to universities in the region So that Australia undergraduate students will be offered an opportunity to study at a university in, say, Japan, and also undertake an internship with a business operating in Japan, for example We

expect that they will be semester-long exchanges or semester-long scholarships, if I can put it that way.

And in this way, by having more Australian students studying in Japan, counter-intuitively we are likely to have more Japanese students deciding to study in Australia, having made contact with Australian students.

So the New Colombo Plan is designed to send more students to the region, but still encourage that two-way exchange The reason that this is a foreign policy initiative, and will be run out of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in Australia, is because we see it as part of our engagement with Asia. If we can have a large body of young Australians, our best and brightest university students,

having an opportunity to live and study and work and immerse themselves in the culture and life of another country, they'll return to Australia with new insights and new ideas, and new perceptions and perspectives That will not only add to our productivity and prosperity, but set up lasting networks and connections with people in our region.

The original Colombo Plan of the 1950s brought students to Australia and I am constantly surprised as I travel throughout Asia, to meet with Prime Ministers, or Foreign Minister, Cabinet Ministers, business leaders, community leaders, who were Colombo Plan scholars in Australia. Their experience has left them with very good feelings about Australia. So we want to be able to create that alumni,

those networks of Australian students being in the region.

And that's why I'm delighted that Japan is likely to be one of our partners in the pilot program that we will establish in 2014.

QUESTION I'd like to ask — it is good to know that your leader said that trilateral cooperation has been going on very well between Australia and Japan and the US. But I'd like to ask your opinion, your views on this idea that, in particular Prime Minister Abe apparently is keep to have a quadrilateral cooperation including India. So then it is said that it is a little bit stimulate China and so I asked

previous Australian Foreign Minister Mr Downer about this idea in 2006, and he was very careful about this idea. But I'd like to ask your views on it.

JULIE BISHOP About a quadrilateral agreement or framework with Japan, India, the United States and Australia? That did actually come about. There was such a quadrilateral agreement reached at one point under the Howard Government. So Mr Downer must have taken your advice, because it did come into being. But the Labor Government decided that they wouldn't proceed with it, and I don't think it ever really got off the ground.

There is another quadrilateral arrangement that has been suggested, and that's including Japan, South Korea, the United States and Australia. And that's something that we're also looking at.

In the case of India, I think that there is so much potential for both our countries to do more with India It is a significant democracy in anyone's language It is a growing regional power. It will be a

significant global power in years to come. And just through the sheer size of the country, it will always

be important. It will always be significant.

Australia is seeking to deepen our connections with India. We are part of what's called the Indian Ocean Rim Association for Regional Cooperation, which is a grouping of Indian Ocean Rim countries, the littoral states of the Indian Ocean. Japan is a dialogue partner to that grouping. Australia is about to Chair that forum, and I hope that through our engagement with India in that forum we might have an opportunity to deepen our bilateral relationship.

In terms of a quadrilateral relationship, that would have to be a judgement for both India and the United States to make. I think Japan and Australia would be keen to pursue it. Whether it was seen as being directly at China would remain to be seen We would have to be open and frank and talk about what outcomes we were seeking to pursue. There is certainly some merit in it, but it was not a matter that was discussed in our Trilateral Strategic Dialogue in Bali the other day. So, I haven't heard it put forward as a recent suggestion, but its certainly something that we can bear in mind as we look to more deeply network our strategic defence and security alliances and partnerships in the region.

QUESTION I have a question regarding refugees. Every year more than 100,000 immigrants are received by Australia Now, in terms of refugees, for the last ten years or so I think you were meandering. During the Howard Government they had a certain policy, and against the criticisms — boat people coming into Australia were suppressed. But the Labor Government eliminated that, and

all of a sudden refugees increased, and then the Pacific solution is revived Now you are the conservative Coalition Government. Once again are you going to have a similar solution at the time of the Howard Government? You will be criticised by Papua New Guinea and other countries accepting refugees. How are you going to respond to those countries? Refugees from Syria, they are going in to the peripheral countries and do you have a plan of having a framework or a ceiling to accept those refugees from Syria?

JULIE BISHOP Australia has one of the most generous refugee and humanitarian programs on a per capita basis, and every year we take a number of people who are assessed by the UNHCR as being refugees. The assumption in your question is that everybody who pays a people-smuggler and gets on a boat to come to Australia, is a refugee, but that is not always the case. So there is a concern that with the weakening of our border protection laws in Australia under the previous Government, it's sent a message to the criminal syndicates that make up people-smugglers, that they should get their trade going again and find customers to bring to Australia It comes down to a question of the integrity of our immigration system, and the sovereignty of our borders. And the new

Abbot Government is determined to ensure that we continue with our refugee program, but that we do not encourage in any way people to pay people-smugglers and get on boats and make a very dangerous sea journey to Australia.

In the last few years over a thousand people have died at sea in the waters between Australia and Indonesia We intend to stop that, to stamp out that practice People can come to Australia through our immigration program. But if they try to do it in ways outside the immigration program it will break down our system. And I'm sure that Japan would recognise the need to maintain the sovereignty of your borders. And that's what we're doing We have seen some success in lessening the number of people who are taking that life threatening journey to Australia, but we will continue to put in place measures to ensure that people who come to Australia do so through the proper channels of our immigration system.

Australia is a migrant country. Apart from the Indigenous Australians, everybody who has come to Australia in one form or another has come from somewhere else in the world And so we are an immigrant country, but the success of our system is that the Government must retain control of who comes to the country. And that's what we're seeking to do at present.

meant to mention, yes, we have already indicated that we will take 500 people who have been found to be refugees from Syria. That was announced just recently.
