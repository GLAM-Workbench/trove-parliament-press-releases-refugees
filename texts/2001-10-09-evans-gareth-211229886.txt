Â

RESPONDING TO TERRORISM: WHERE CONFLICT PREVENTION AND RESOLUTION 
FIT IN

Â

Â

Â

Address by Gareth Evans, President of the International 
Crisis Group, to Conflict Prevention and Resolution Forum, School of 
Advanced International Studies (SAIS), Johns Hopkins University, Washington 
DC, 9 October 2001

Â

Â

Â

September 11 - and how to respond to it - is 
not an easy issue to deal with in a measured, analytical way. The scale 
of the horror, in which the US suffered more casualties to terrorism 
in a single day than Israel and Ireland have suffered in fifty years, 
is still only just beginning to sink in.Â  None of us anywhere in 
the world have remained untouched by the attacks. Even in faraway Australia: 
some 60 of my countrymen and women were killed. But the shock and loss 
have been profound beyond measure for Americans, both because of the 
many thousands who died and the terrible sense of violation and insecurity 
11 September produced throughout the country. For those of you, particularly, 
who have suffered directly and personally the loss of loved ones and 
friends and colleagues, I offer my deepest and most heartfelt condolences.

Â

Â

Â

It would hardly be surprising if 11 September 
had induced, in public and official reactions, either total paralysis, 
or perhaps more likely, a blind, irrational, uncontrollable rage. It 
is a measure of the maturity of this country, deeply impressive to an 
outsider, that the reactions to date have overwhelmingly been of a different 
kind - gritty, determined, measured and, most reassuringly of all 
for the rest of the world, multilateral rather than unilateral. In just 
about every one of the different dimensions in which a response is required 
- and later on I will spell out five kinds of response which I think 
are crucial - things so far have been handled very well indeed, with 
a high measure of understanding of the issues at stake being evident 
right across the community.

Â

Â

Â

There has certainly been evident, in both the 
official and public response, a good grasp of the essential nature of 
terrorism, as involving an enemy harder to define than any previously 
fought, and a war against it like no other previously fought. The computer 
literate generations have understood quickly enough that what is involved 
here is not so much any clear-cut hierarchy, or even set of hierarchies, 
but rather multiple groups operating like the discrete but interconnected 
nodes of an electronic network. Those less computer literate have been 
able to grasp a more traditional metaphor, as enunciated by Pakistani 
President Musharraf among others: that individual terrorists are like 
the leaves of a tree, and just as easily replaceable; while terrorist 
organisations are like its branches, separate but connected to the larger 
organism, and able to be chopped off, but likely to grow again so long 
as the tree has roots. The virtue of these metaphors is that they convey 
a sense of the complexity of the task, and the need for a patient long 
haul: there has been a hunger for military strike action, and massive 
support for it, but there is no great anticipation that this will produce 
a quick fix, and that is healthy.

Â

Â

Â

The one area where I’m   not   so sure that a clear 
consensus exists, or that the balance of opinion has got it right, is 
the subject of this forum: the question of just where, in responding 
to terrorism, conflict prevention and resolution fit in. The notion 
that terrorism has roots certainly has a toehold, as I have just acknowledged, 
and there is a general acknowledgement that at least one of those roots 
involves the conflicts and policy issues that generate grievance. But 
there is a considerable reluctance to follow the reasoning through, 
and squarely confront the implications of it for American foreign policy.Â  
Even to raise the issue of the relevance of the unresolved Israel-Palestinian 
conflict, or the lingering grievances left over from the Gulf War - 
to suggest that addressing conflict issues more constructively and successfully 
might be at least part of an appropriate response strategy - is to walk 
on eggshells. “You want to reward the terrorists”, you’ll be told; 
you are accepting that there was something defensible or legitimate 
about their actions;Â  you’re “blaming America” itself for 
the terrible evils worked upon it

Â

Â

Â

Sometimes the point is made 
elegantly, as for example by Harold Evans in last weekend’s   Independent  : “What 
[Americans] cannot stomach is the vapours of moral relativism from across 
the Atlantic, from all those in Europe who seek to explain the depravity 
of 11 September as somehow related to anger created by American foreign 
policy.”Â  And sometimes it’s made rather less elegantly, as 
in this email I received recently after a report appeared in the Chicago 
TribuneÂ  summarising what I had thought was a very cautious and 
measured speech of mine on these themes to the Chicago Council on Foreign 
Relations: “I have read your comments in the above referenced article”, 
my correspondent wrote. “You have numerous suggestions for America 
and ‘the West’. I have but one for you. GET THE F… OUT OF AMERICA 
YOU F…ING COMMUNIST PIECE OF S…”

Â

Â

Â

I think the only way to move 
the debate forward in a rational fashion is to put the whole issue in 
its proper context, and to make crystal clear what is being argued or 
suggested and what is not. My own approach is to argue that we do have 
to address the conflicts and policy issues that generate grievance, 
but only as one ofÂ    five   inter-linked but conceptually quite distinct 
kinds of objectives that have to be simultaneously pursued if the response 
to terrorism in general, and 11 September in particular, is to be effective.

Â

Â

Â

Â One of those objectives 
is primarily internal in focus, but the other four are external - 
and of these, one is essentially short-term in approach, another is 
medium term and two are long-term. Some of the objectives are in real 
tension with each other, and it’s not easy for any government anywhere 
to get the balance right - steering a tight course between neither 
over-reacting, in a way that is counter-productive, nor under-reacting, 
in a way that is unresponsive to the mood of the people.

Â

For the most part, I think 
the right balance is being struck at the moment, and if US anger and 
shock can continue to be channelled as productively as it has been so 
far, the terrorists’ triumph will be shortlived indeed. What was a 
massive attempt to expose American vulnerabilities will have served 
only to prove beyond doubt this country’s extraordinary strengths 
- both as a democratic country and as a global power for good.

Â

Â

Â

(1)Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â    Strengthening Internal Security

Â

Â

Â

The first objective, or necessary 
element of any response, is overwhelmingly internal in character, and 
to that extent I won’t dwell on it here.

Â

Â

Â

Getting this part of the 
response right involves, for a start, hard practical questions. Airline 
and airport security are obviously crucial, but the sound we’re hearing 
all over the country right now is not only of cockpit doors but stable 
doors being beautifully and comprehensively bolted. What we really all 
have to be worrying about (and what Governor Ridge as the head of the 
new Office of Homeland Security has to be particularly worrying about) 
is the   next   kind of attack - in particular of a chemical 
or biological kind - which we presently haven’t even begun to get 
our heads round how to deal with.

Â

Â

Â

There are also obviously 
big issues of principle involved , with which the Congress is now beginning 
to wrestle: how much liberty can you sacrifice in the name of security 
without losing the very identityÂ  and character ofÂ  the nation 
that the attackers have set out to destroy?

Â

Â

Â

The internal response cannot 
be wholly insulated from the external: some kinds of internal responses 
do have a real capacity to resonate beyond the country in a way that 
can either help or hinder the larger cause.Â  It is crucial in this 
context that policymakers remember, as to their credit they overwhelmingly 
have done so far, that this is a war against deeds, not beliefs; and 
that there are huge downside risks, in terms of winning the sustained 
cooperation of other countries, in engaging in any form of negative 
religious or racial profiling. As an Australian, whose country was justly 
seen as a pariah among the third world until the late 1960s when we 
finally abandoned our appallingly discriminatoryÂ  “White Australia” 
immigration policy, I am acutely sensitive to just how much damage can 
be done to a country’s reputation, credibility and effectiveness, 
by this kind of insensitivity.

Â

Â

Â

Â

Â

(2)Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â    Bringing the Perpetrators to Justice

Â

Â

Â

There can be no doubt about 
America’s moral and legal right to take immediate action - including, 
as necessary, robust military action - against the perpetrators of 
the 11 September crimes, and those who aid and abet, or harbour and 
shelter them. In international law, the self-defence provision in Article 
51 of the UN Charter is itself sufficient justification.

Â

Â

Â

What is crucial, however, 
is that there be a continuing acknowledgement of the constraints which 
must apply in taking such action - not just as a matter of law and 
morality but of hard-headed national self interest. There are two constraints, 
in particular, that America’s friends and allies, and a great many 
voices in this country, have been properly emphasising over and again 
as necessaryÂ  to ensure the effectiveness both of the short-term 
action against the perpetrators of 11 September, and the long-term fight 
against further such acts.

Â

Â

Â

First, the targets of the 
action have to be credibly identified. The stronger the response, and 
the wider the range of targets, the stronger the evidentiary foundation 
has to be if the support of friends and allies is not to fall away, 
and - even more importantly -a generally cooperative international 
enforcement front against terrorism is to be capable of being maintained 
in the future.Â  The case against Osama bin Laden personally has 
I think been made strongly enough for these purposes: as presented publicly 
so far, it would probably not be enough to convict him in a Western 
or international court, but it would certainly be enough to bring him 
before one. As the former ministerial head of my own country’s equivalent 
of both the CIA and FBI, or MI6 and MI5, I have a more acute sense than 
most of the weaknesses as well as strengths of unrevealable intelligence 
sources, but on this occasion - bearing in mind the non-hierarchical 
character of terrorist organisation, the nature and extent of the influence 
thatÂ  bin Laden has unquestionably been exercising, and now the 
chilling character of his own statement on television last weekend, 
I am not inclined to be too sceptical.

Â

Â

Â

And although a considerably 
higher evidentiary hurdle has to be jumped before an all out war is 
launched on a sovereign country, the case is also compelling for targeted 
action against those of Afghanistan’sÂ  Taliban leadership who 
are now so clearly and unashamedly continuing to protect and defend 
Osama bin Laden and his followers.

Â

Â

Â

The second constraint is 
that the action must be proportionate. In particular, theÂ  killing 
and maiming of the innocent has to be avoided at almost all costs. If 
that happens, not only will the present coalition of the willing - 
still extremely fragile at its Islamic edges - fall apart, but we 
willÂ  just create a whole new generation of people fearing and 
hating the West and everything it stands for, a new breeding ground 
for a whole new generation of fanatics;

Â

Â

Â

In this context, it is impossible 
to make too often the point - of which this Administration is clearly 
now acutely conscious -Â  that whatever else you do, you must not 
allow either the short term response against the 11 September perpetratorsÂ  
or the long term war against terrorism generally, to be characterised 
as a crusade against any particular brand of religion: it must, again, 
be a war against deeds, not against beliefs. Similarly, it is critical 
in the present context that any military action directed against the 
Taliban leadership be characterised as just that - not a war against 
Afghanistan and its people. The unprecedented simultaneous focus on 
food aid and humanitarian relief while the bombs are still dropping 
is an important way of making that point and should be continued.

Â

Â

Â

There is just one other precautionary 
note that must be sounded, highly relevant to this forum’s focus on 
conflict prevention. One just hopes that with all the attention now 
being focused on destroying the Taliban, just as much attention is being 
devoted to how a new and more credible government can be constructed 
from the ground up - whether through the mechanism of a   loya jirga   convened 
by the former king or otherwise - that will be more credible, and 
successful in addressing the country’s and region’s problems than 
its predecessors.

Â

Â

Â

This point leads naturally 
to the third major objective I want to identify as a critical part of 
the 11 September response strategy, one with an external and medium-term 
focus:

Â

Â

Â

Â

Â

(3)Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â    Building International Defences against Future 
Attacks

Â

Â

Â

Â

Â

The first line of international 
defence - moving beyond internal security - must be in the countries 
of origin of the terrorists themselves. The CIA, FBI and US military 
can never be as good as the Taliban, should it have chosen to be, or 
Saudi Arabia or Sudan before them, in dealing with Osama bin Laden; 
Mossad and the Israeli Defence Force - as tough and competent as they 
may - can never be as effective as the Palestinian Authority in cracking 
down on the fanatics of Hamas and other extremist groups; neither the 
Indians or anyone else could possiblyÂ  be as good as the Pakistani 
government and military in curbing, if it chose to do, the terrorist 
fanaticism that continues to tear apart Kashmir.

Â

Â

Â

To strengthen these international 
defences you have to build the   capacity   and above all the   will   for these countries and authorities to act, both 
internally and in close cooperation with the wider international community.Â Â  
Intelligence has to be supplied, financial supply lines broken, logistic 
support offeredÂ  and common strategies systematically pursued over 
time. The electronic network metaphor is helpful here in reminding us 
of the extraordinarily complex nature of the continuing challenge: as 
some of the ‘netwar’ theorists have put it, “the West must start 
to build its own networks and must learn to swarm the enemy, in order 
to keep it on the run until it can be destroyed.” [Ronfeld and Aquilla, 
quoted in David Ignatius, ‘The Adversary is Fundamentalist Networks, 
not Islam Itself’,   International 
Herald Tribune  , 8 October]

Â

Â

Â

Building those networks - 
through building the necessary capacity and will in all the relevant 
countries concerned - is a huge policy challenge for the West, to 
meet by whatever combination of carrots and sticks is required - taking 
into account the necessity for the response we are encouraging to be 
intelligent and measured, not counterproductive. An excellent start 
has been made in this respect over the last few weeks, not least in 
Pakistan: the huge challenge will be for the new international defences 
to be sustainable.

Â

.

Â

There is one important negative 
constraint here, which ICG has been much emphasising lately in the context 
of the Central Asian republics, and in particular Uzbekistan: whatever 
the short-term benefits, in terms ofÂ  active cooperation, that 
might be seen to follow from doing so, it is not wiseÂ  to uncritically 
embrace regimes whose principles and methods are alien to the very values 
we are trying to protect. There are plenty of governments and authorities 
only too happy to crack down on dissent of any kind for regime survival 
purposes, but it has to be remembered that frustration with local leaderships 
that are repressive or inept or both has been very much part of the 
terrorist problem. Some of the tough-minded leaders of the former Soviet 
republics of Central Asia have cracked down heavily on moderate Islamic 
movements and political opposition generally, and are only too keen 
to have the support of the West in continuing to do so: but in the process 
they have produced a whole new movement becoming more and more genuinely 
Islamist extremist in reaction, and the danger is that that movement 
will become stronger still.

Â

Â

Â

It is in the context of building 
sustainable international defences against terrorism that I think the 
issue of tackling the so-called root causes of terrorism - including 
addressing unresolved conflicts and political grievances - has its 
most immediate and obvious relevance. The point is simply that if we 
want, as we must, strong local action against terrorism, we have to 
go all out to create environments in the countries in question in which 
there is more community support for cracking down on terrorism, and 
in which insecure governments like that of Pakistan, and many others 
in the region,Â  will feel more confident in doing so. And that 
in turn means that it is important to adopt, as at least part of the 
repertoire of responses to terror, strategies designed to address the 
problem   at source  Â  - addressing the policy issues that we 
know generate grievance, and the social and economic conditions that 
we know generate despair.

Â

Â

Â

Â

Â

(4)Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â    Addressing the Conflicts and Policy Issues that 
Generate Grievance

Â

Â

Â

So far as the motives for 
terrorist action are concerned, it is obvious that no simplistic connection 
can be drawn between political grievance redress and terrorist threat 
reduction.Â  Clearly not all terrorist violence is based on this 
kind of grievance,Â  and the Israel-Palestinian conflict in particular 
must not be seen as the root of all Islamist extremism: indeed the World 
Trade Centre and Pentagon attacks clearly being planned at a time when 
optimism about the Israel-Palestinian peace process was at its height. 
Tom Friedman and others beating hard on the ‘Don’t blame America’ 
drum are at pains to emphasise these points, and they are right.

Â

Â

Â

Â But equally there can 
be no doubt that backward steps in this and other peace processes do 
inflame sentiment in the streets, and make it that much harder for governments 
in these regions to crack down on domestically generated terrorism, 
and especially for them to cooperate with the West in all the ways that 
are crucially necessary. To begin to drain the swamp in which terrorism 
breeds - or to cut out the roots of the tree, or to break some of 
the inter-nodal network connections, whichever metaphor you prefer - 
I believe that there has to be a major effort made to address some of 
the avoidable sources of grievance: the unresolved conflictsÂ  and 
policy issues that help create the environment in which terrorism can 
grow and flourish. There just has to be a renewed commitment and focus 
on the kind ofÂ  conditions that help to create individuals able 
to believe that killing thousands of civilians is not only acceptable, 
but heroic. To do this is not toÂ  ‘reward’ terrorist behaviour: 
it’s to answer it.

Â

Â

Â

Maybe my judgment here is 
a little affected by my role as head of the International Crisis Group, 
an organisation dedicated to preventing and containing deadly conflict 
. But our strong belief is that the task of fighting terrorism cannot 
be separated from the task of preventing, containing and ending conflict. 
All too often the places that generate terrorism - along with drug 
trafficking, and health pandemics, and refugee outflows, and international 
environmental disasters - are shattered societies where grievance, 
greed, repression, poverty and prejudice have, in various combinations, 
fedÂ  violence, utter despair and extremism.Â  Think not only 
of the Middle East and Central Asia, but of Northern Ireland, the Sudan, 
Colombia, the Caucasus. In none of these conflicts, or a dozen others, 
has the conflict stayed local.

Â

Â

Â

It won’t be easy to win 
domestic consensus on all of this. Many Americans can already be heard 
saying, understandably enough, that “This is what we get for sticking 
our noses into so many problems around the world that are not our business.” 
Another variation on this theme has been spelt out in crystal clear 
-Â  and to my ears at least, extremely disconcerting - terms by 
Robert Kaplan in a recent interview:

Â

Â

Â

The first thing no-one has 
realised yet is that these attacks mean the end of Wilsonian idealism. 
Bosnia, Kosovo, Rwanda are all of the charts, assigned to the sepia-toned 
1990s.

Â

We can only afford to do 
good works abroad when security at home can be taken for granted.

Â

Â

Â

The answer that Kaplan and 
people reacting like him must hear from their leaders is that, like 
it or not, what seem so often to be dirty little wars in faraway places   are   America’sÂ  
business, and the business of the whole international community, simply 
because their impact so often reaches globally. To try and address these 
conflicts and crises is not a matter of Boy Scout good deeds - of 
doing good works abroad; it is a matter of hard-headed national interest, 
and hard headed domestic security interest.

Â

Â

Â

Of all the countries in the 
world, the US is the most able - because of its diplomatic, military 
and economic resources - to play a role for good in ending deadly 
conflict.Â  What America’s friends and allies want more than ever 
now is for the US to play that role - and not disengage. This Administration 
is off to a better start now in this respect than anyone could have 
dreamed possible a month ago. The trick will be to make sure, when the 
dust from 11 September settles a little more, that that effort continues.

Â

Â

Â

Â

Â

(5)Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â    Addressing Underlying Social, Economic and Cultural 
Issues that Generate Grievance

Â

Â

Â

Any comprehensive response 
to terrorism has to, finally, address the reality that not all the festering 
grievances that breed it have a rational, or semi-rational, foundation 
in unresolved or badly-resolved conflicts, or other policy issues of 
this kind. Clearly a significant part of the story is a blind hatred 
of modernity, of the impact of globalisation and the greater interaction 
andÂ  interdependence countries, and the new cultural currents associated 
with that (in particular those relating to greater freedom and opportunity 
for women) - which are all undermining, particularly in the way they 
are being embraced by young people, old family and social and economic 
and governmental values and institutions.

Â

Â

Â

The unhappy reality is that 
the US is the natural international target of this kind of resentment. 
It is a magnet for the hatred of those who feel themselves deprived.Â  
This country’s role in the global economy, its perceived political 
influence - and above all its perceived cultural influence everywhere 
- mean that trouble is bound to follow it, through whatever walls 
its citizens may be tempted to build around themselves.

Â

Â

Â

This is the hardest of all 
the underlying causes to address, not least because the phenomenon of 
globalisation and everything that goes with it is so obviously irreversible, 
and because the cultural dimensions of it - the freedom and opportunity 
associated with modernisation and global interaction - are so obviously 
attractive to so many people.

Â

Â

Â

But even though there are 
no easy answers, part of the responseÂ  must be to try to gradually 
diminish the envy and sense of both absolute and comparative economic 
disadvantage that are significant parts of the problem - to make a 
sustained effort to improve social conditions, reduce disparities of 
wealth, create more and more economic opportunity, and above all to 
create more and more educational opportunity.Â  We know that, in 
Pakistan in particular, religious parties and groups - including those 
inclined to extremism - are attracting more and more support by offering, 
through the mosques and associated madrassas, low cost education which 
millions of poor families simply cannot obtain for their children in 
any other way.

Â

Â

Â

There is a need to respond 
to social and economic deprivation with thoughtful and generous development 
assistance proposals, and the US has an enormous capacity to do so, 
even in economically stressful times, when one remembers that US foreign 
aid is now down to an all time low, and an internationally rather embarrassing, 
0.11 per cent of GDP.Â  This is not again, a matter of good works 
appropriate for the good times when we have less to worry about internally. 
It’s a matter of the hard headed pursuit of national interest.Â  
As with addressing political grievances, it’s all part of the process 
of draining the swamps in which grievance and despair breed.

Â

Â

Â

It’s just no coincidence 
that the countries from which most terror appears to have sprung have 
been those with collapsed or faltering economies, in which either most 
people have no wealth at all, or where there are very great disparities 
of wealth, and where the population at large feels left out, with no 
sense at all of being beneficiaries of the great wealth-generating bonanza 
of globalisation.

Â

Â

Â

Again one must not be too 
simplistic about any of this. There is no iron law that wealth or education 
will diminish fanaticism or hatred of the West - Osama bin Laden is 
himself living proof of that - but there is every reason to believe 
it must help.

Â

Â

Â

Trying to help a create a 
better policy response to these dilemmas is all that any of us in the 
policy community can do - whether as government insiders, or as academic 
or think-tank or NGO outsiders, or somewhere in the beltway world in 
between.

Â

Â

Â

This is not the occasionÂ  
- as it might have been without 11 September - to give you a commercial 
about ICG, and all that we have been doing and hope to continue to do 
(including now in the Middle East and West Asia) in the field of conflict 
prevention, containment and resolution, employing all the resources 
of field-based analysis, practical policy prescription, and high-level 
advocacy available to us.

Â

Â

Â

It’s appropriate for me 
to simply acknowledge the credibility and effectiveness of the organisations 
that sponsor this forum, and to say what a pleasure and privilege it 
is for me to be able to join my distinguished friend and colleague Lee 
Hamilton in speaking to this very high powered, distinguished and thoughtful 
group gathered here today.
