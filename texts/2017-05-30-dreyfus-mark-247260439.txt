MARK DREYFUS QC MP  SHADOW ATTORNEY-GENERAL  SHADOW MINISTER FOR NATIONAL SECURITY  MEMBER FOR ISAACS

TIME FOR TURNBULL AND BRANDIS TO DEFEND THEIR MAN

It has been four days since ASIO boss Duncan Lewis appeared at Senate estimates,  and expertly handled a series of clumsy questions from Senator Pauline Hanson  alleging a connection between refugees and terrorism.

He explained the fact, based on intelligence and the rigorous judgement of our  security agencies, that there was no causal link between being a refugee and being  a terrorist.

Since that evening ASIO’s Director-General, Mr Lewis, a former Army Special  Operations Commander and former Ambassador to NATO, has faced a storm of  criticism not just from right-wing armchair commentators, but now from the former  Prime Minister of the government that appointed him.

Mr Abbott’s suggestion that Mr Lewis has jeopardised ASIO’s standing in the  community by trying to combat Senator Hanson’s fear-mongering with the facts is  ridiculous and cynically self-serving. Trying to undermine the standing of our  intelligence agencies for some imagined political advantage is typical of Abbott’s  destructiveness.

Does Mr Abbott really think that he knows more than the head of Australia’s  intelligence agency about the nature of the terrorist threat to Australia?

Mr Lewis has a larger responsibility than pandering to prejudice. He is more  interested in keeping Australians safe, and that is a job he has performed excellently.

While Mr Abbott and other coalition MPs have attacked Mr Lewis, Prime Minister  Turnbull and Attorney-General George Brandis have stayed silent. This is  unacceptable.

It’s time for this government to stand up for the dedicated public servants and  officers who serve this country so loyally.
