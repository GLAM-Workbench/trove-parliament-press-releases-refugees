GOVERNMENT SEEKS TO CHANGE RUlES MIDSTREAM

The Australian Democrats condemned both the Government and Opposition tonight for  -seeking to change migration laws when matters were before the courts. -- - -- --

Senator John Coulter, spokesman on Immigration for the Australian Democrats, moved  an amendment in the Senate tOnight to have discussion of the Migration Amendment Bill  1992 deferred until after Thursday's court case in which 37 boat people are seeking tO  be released from detention.

The amendment was defeated by the combined vote of Government and Opposition.

"This Bill seeks to keep all people in custody until they are either granted entry or  removed from Australia" said SenatOr Coulter. "The Bill limits -iFie perTod of custody tO  nine months. In principle, the Bill is worthy of support.

"However, pushing this Bill through tonight and having it gazetted tomorrow will mean  the hands of the judge are tied on Thursday, irrespective of the merit of the 37 cases.

"Passage of the Bill tonight would clearly pre-empt the court judgements.

"It _0 _totally un_<:tcceptable to change the rules of the game after 37 people h~ve seperately  commenced proceedings for release from custody. We should let the court cases be heard  and then bring back the legislation after those judgements have been handed down"  concluded Senator Coulter.
