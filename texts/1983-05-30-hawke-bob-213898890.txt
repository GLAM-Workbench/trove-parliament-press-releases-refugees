SPEECH NOTES - PRIME MINISTER , , .

Â£7

FEDERATED IRONWORKERS' ASSOCIATION (FIA) . ANNUAL NATIONAL CONFERENCE - 30 MAY 1983

.  DELIGHTED TO ADDRESS NATIONAL CONFERENCE, LAST

ADDRESSED FIA ON 15 FEBRUARY AND SPOKE OF THREAT

TO VIABILITY OF STEEL INDUSTRY,

,  WILL REPORT NOW ON LABOR PARTY PROGRESS TO DATE,

BUT FIRST SOME PRELIMINARY COMMENTS ON ANOTHER ISSUE

OF CONCERN TO THE TRADE UNION MOVEMENT - TAXATION

OF LUMP SUM SUPERANNUATION, LATER, I WILL OUTLINE

. PROGRESS IN MORE GENERAL TERMS,

LUMP SUM SUPERANNUATION

,  GOVERNMENT HAS MOVED IN THIS AREA AS PART OF ITS

CONCERN TO SEE THAT THE BURDEN OF THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY

PROGRAM FALLS ON AUSTRALIANS IN A RELATIVELY GOOD

POSITION TO BEAR IT. .... . .

. ORIGINALLY SUPERANNUATION T A X  C ON CESSIONS DESIGNED

TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO PROVIDE FOR OWN RETIREMENT AND

REDUCE DEMAND ON GOVERNMENT PENSIONS SYSTEM, THE TAX

CONCESSIONS ON EMPLOYEES' AND EMPLOYERS' CONTRIBUTIONS

COST ABOUT $2 BILLION PER ANNUM, ALL AUSTRALIAN WORKERS

AND TAXPAYERS PAY FOR THIS, BUT THE BENEFITS GO TO

ONLY 40 PER CENT OF EMPLOYEES, AND MOST OF THE BENEFITS

GO TO A MUCH SMALLER PROPORTION OF PEOPLE ON HIGH

INCOMES,

'

2.

ALTHOUGH ENORMOUSLY COSTLY, THE SUPERANNUATION

CONCESSIONS WERE NOT ACHIEVING THEIR PURPOSE,

THEY ENCOURAGED EMPLOYEES TO TAKE BENEFITS AS LUMP

SUMS, WHICH WERE OFTEN THEN INVESTED IN WAYS THAT

ALLOWED PENSION TO BE TAKEN AS WELL,

UNDER NEW ARRANGEMENTS, LUMP SUMS ACCUMULATED BEFORE

MAY 19 WILL NOT BE TAXED, FOLLOWING CONSULTATIONS WITH

ACTU, CABINET WILL CONSIDER TODAY A METHOD OF CALCULATING

THE PROPORTION OF THE LUMP SUM THAT IS FREE OF TAX

THAT IS HIGHLY FAVOURABLE TO SUPERANNUANTS, THAT IS,

ON THE PROPORTION OF THE TOTAL YEARS OF SERVICE

REPRESENTED BY SERVICE BEFORE MAY 19 1983.

ALWAYS UNDERSTOOD THAT A NUMBER OF OTHER ISSUES WOULD

NEED TO BE SETTLED FOLLOWING CONSULTATIONS WITH UNIONS

AND LIFE OFFICES, THESE ISSUES INCLUDE PORTABILITY,

AND THE PROPORTION OF EMPLOYEES' CONTRIBUTIONS THAT

SHOULD BE EXEMPTED,

PART OF THE NEW PACKAGE INCLUDES THE TAXATION OF LUMP

SUMS ACCUMULATED BY SERVICE AFTER MAY 19 UNDER THE OLD

ARRANGEMENTS IF LUMP SUM IS USED TO PURCHASE CONTINUING

ANNUITY OR PENSION, LAWS WILL BE CHANGED TO MAKE SUCH

ANNUITIES MORE ATTRACTIVE, THEY WILL ASSIST PREPARATION

FOR RETIREMENT BY SOME’RECIPIENTS OF LUMP SUMS,

, OVERALL, THE MEASURE MODIFIES A BENEFIT THAT WAS NOT

BEING USED AS IT WAS INTENDED, AND WHICH WAS AVAILABLE

.  ONLY TO 40 PER CENT OF RELATIVELY-WELL-OFF AUSTRALIANS

WITH THE LARGEST BENEFITS GOING TO A FEW PER CENT OF

THE -MOST WELL OFF,

STEEL INDUSTRY .

,  BASIS OF GOVERNMENT'S APPROACH - ABSOLUTE URGENCY

OF ADDITIONAL ASSISTANCE - VERY VIABILITY OF INDUSTRY

AT STAKE.

PROBLEMS FACING INDUSTRY ARE EXTREMELY COMPLICATED -

UNFORTUNATELY NO EASY OR COSTLESS SOLUTIONS,

,  PROBLEM IS NOT JUST INCREASED STEEL IMPORTS, RATHER

OVERSEAS PRESSURES HAVE AGGRAVATED OTHER PRESSURES,

INCLUDING FROM THE DOWNTURN IN THE DOMESTIC ECONOMY,

.  OVERSEAS PRESSURES DERIVE FROM A COMBINATION OF THE

EMERGENCE OF SIGNIFICANT EXCESS CAPACITY IN WORLD

STEEL INDUSTRY SINCE MID 1970'S - WHICH IS LIKELY

TO PERSIST FOR SOME TIME - AND THE CURRENT WORLD

RECESSION,

,  BUT NOTWITHSTANDING ALL THIS, LIVELIHOOD OF THOUSANDS

OF MEN AND WOMEN WORKING IN STEEL INDUSTRY AT RISK

UNLESS FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PUTS IN PLACE A WORKABLE

ASSISTANCE PACKAGE,

3,

WHEN I ADDRESSED YOU ON FEBRUARY 15 GAVE THE FOLLOWING

COMMITMENTS ON BEHALF OF A FUTURE LABOR GOVERNMENT:

- FUNDAMENTAL COMMITMENT - MAINTENANCE OF STEEL Ã¢ÂÂ

INDUSTRY

- SET OURSELVES THE OBJECTIVE OF MAINTAINING Â·

JOBS OF THOSE CURRENTLY EMPLOYED

- ATTEMPT TO ACCELERATED FINALISATION OF IAC

REPORT

- PREPARATION OF A 10 YEAR DEVELOPMENT PLAN WITHIN

THE FIRST 100 DAYS, . . . . .

WILL NOW REPORT ON THE PROGRESS ON THESE COMMITMENTS,

BUT FIRST A BASIC POINT ABOUT JOBS, I AM SATISFIED

ON THE BASIS OF DISCUSSIONS AND PROGRESS TO DATE

THAT THE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM WE PUT IN PLACE WILL BE

ONE THAT GIVES THE BEST PROSPECT OF A SECURE

EMPLOYMENT FUTURE IN THE INDUSTRY.

THIS WILL BE AT CONSIDERABLE COST TO THE REST OF THE

Au s t r a l i a n  p e o p l e ,  B u t I f e e l  e n t i t l e d  t o a s k o t h e r

Au s t r a l i a n s  t o m a k e  s o m e  c o n t r i b u t i o n  b e c a u s e  o f t h e

EXTREME ECONOMIC RECESSION IN T H E .STEEL-PRODUCING

a r e a s .  B u t in r e t u r n , t h e o t h e r  Au s t r a l i a n s , w h o

WILL BE PAYING FOR THIS ASSISTANCE, ARE ENTITLED TO

ASK FOR A FULL-SCALE EFFORT TO RAISE WORK EFFORT,

IMPROVE WORK PRACTICES AND RAISE PRODUCTIVITY IN THE

STEEL INDUSTRY.

5.

WE HAVE NOW REACHED THE FINAL LEG OF THAT PROCESS,

AND EXPECT TO BE ABLE TO ANNOUNCE NEW ARRANGEMENTS

BY THE END OF JUNE, WHICH WILL BE PRETTY CLOSE TO

THE 100 DAYS, MY MINISTER FOR INDUSTRY AND COMMERCE

ASKED FOR THIS SLIGHT EXTENSION OF TIME, AND I THOUGHT

IT BETTER TO GET IT RIGHT IN 110 DAYS THAN TO GET IT

WRONG IN 100 DAYS,

I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT ANYTHING WE DO

WILL BE DIRECTED AT ASSISTANCE TO STEEL-MAKING JOBS,

AND NOT AT ASSISTING STEEL-MAKING COMPANIES AS SUCH,

ANY COMMITMENT THAT WE MAKE TO STEEL-MAKING COMPANIES

WILL BE DESIGNED TO PROTECT JOBS.

WILL BRIEFLY REVIEW DEVELOPMENTS SINCE COMING TO OFFICE.

AS YOU KNOW, SOON AFTER ELECTION MINISTER FOR INDUSTRY

AND COMMERCE INITIATED DISCUSSIONS WITH BHP AND WITH

FIA AND OTHER UNIONS INVOLVED.

HE ALSO WROTE TO CHAIRMAN OF IAC EMPHASISING THE NEED

TO EXPEDITE COMPLETION OF ITS FINAL REPORT.

STEEL INDUSTRY ADVISORY COUNCIL (WHICH INCLUDES

MANUFACTURERS, UNIONS, USERS, IMPORTERS AND

PARLIAMENTARIANS) IS ENGAGED IN STUDIES ON THE

LONG-TERM FUTURE OF THE INDUSTRY (INCLUDING FUTURE

DEMAND, DESIRABLE WORKFORCE LEVELS, AREAS FOR

IMPROVING COMPETITIVENESS AND ASSISTANCE OPTIONS),

SHOULD BE ABLE TO FINALISE LONG-TERM STEEL INDUSTRY

DEVELOPMENT PLAN BY THE END OF THE NEXT MONTH, THIS

PLAN IS, OF COURSE, A KEY ELEMENT IN OUR EFFORTS TO

SECURE JOB LEVELS IN THE STEEL INDUSTRY,

En v i s a g e  t h a t  " the p l a n  w i l l  i n c o r p o r a t e  u n d e r t a k i n g s

FROM BOTH BHP AND THE GOVERNMENT REGARDING PRODUCTIVITY,

TECHNOLOGY, PRICING AND SECURITY OF TENURE FOR

WORKERS AND INVOLVE A TIME FRAME AND DEGREE OF

FLEXIBILITY APPROPRIATE TO CHANGES INÂ· INDUSTRY

CIRCUMSTANCES,

Th e FINAL ASSISTANCE PACKAGE THAT IS AGREED TO

WILL, OF COURSE, NEED TO HAVE PARTICULAR REGARD

TO THE DIRECT EMPLOYMENT EFFECTS IN STEEL PRODUCING

REGIONS BUT WILL ALSO NEED TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE

COSTS TO THE COMMUNITY OF A BASIC RAW MATERIAL FOR

USER INDUSTRIES AND THE EMPLOYMENT IMPLICATIONS FOR

THOSE INDUSTRIES,

Fu n d a m e n t a l  p o i n t  - j o b s  s l i d e  i n s t e e l  i n d u s t r y

HAS BEEN UNMITIGATED DISASTER. REPEAT - ASSISTANCE

PACKAGE THAT WE PUT IN PLACE WILL BE ONE THAT GIVES

BEST PROSPECT OF SECURING EMPLOYMENT FOR STEEL

7.

WORKERS.

8,

JOB CREATION - POSSIBLE FURTHER COMMENTS IF APPROPRIATE

REGARDLESS OF THE LEVEL OF ASSISTANCE PROVIDED TO

THE INDUSTRY, THE EMPLOYMENT SITUATION IN STEEL

PRODUCING REGIONS WILL STILL REMAIN DEPRESSED,

,  WE CAME TO OFFICE WITH A PLEDGE TO PURSUE EXPANSIONARY

POLICIES WHICH EMPHASISE JOBS,

,  OUR BASIC STRATEGY IS TO LAY THE BASIS FOR A DURABLE

ECONOMIC RECOVERY, IT IS ONLY THROUGH SUSTAINED

.  ECONOMIC GROWTH THAT WE CAN CREATE THE LARGE NUMBER

OF JOBS REQUIRED TO MAKE REAL INROADS INTO THE MASSIVE

UNEMPLOYMENT PROBLEM WHICH WE HAVE INHERITED,

,  BECAUSE OF THE IMPORTANCE WE ATTACH TO THE IMMEDIATE

CREATION OF ADDITIONAL JOBS, WE HAVE ALREADY MOVED -

IN FULFILMENT OF OUR ELECTION COMMITMENT - TO INTRODUCE

A MAJOR NEW JOB CREATION PROGRAM, THE COMMUNITY EMPLOYMENT

PROGRAM, AS ANNOUNCED ON 19 MAY, $30^MILLION WILL BE MADE

AVAILABLE FOR PROJECTS UNDER THE PROGRAM IN 1983/84.

,  OUR AIM IS TO REACH A LEVEL OF ACTIVITY UNDER THE

PROGRAM WHERE WE WILL BE PROVIDING, IN A FULL YEAR, UP

TO 70,000 FULL TIME JOBS FOR AN AVERAGE DURATION OF SIX

MONTHS, MANY MORE JOBS WILL BE CREATED INDIRECTLY BY

THE INCREASED DEMAND FOR GOODS AND SERVICES AND HIGHER

INCOMES WHICH WILL RESULT.

9

THE PROGRAM IS DESIGNED PARTICULARLY TO BENEFIT

THE LONG TERM UNEMPLOYED, ESPECIALLY THOSE MOST

DISADVANTAGED IN THE LABOUR MARKET WHO WOULD BE

LEAST LIKELY TO BE ASSISTED BY GENERAL EMPLOYMENT

GROWTH AS ECONOMIC ACTIVITY PICKS UP,

THE MINISTER FOR EMPLOYMENT AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS,

MR WILLIS, IS TAKING STEPS TO ENSURE THAT, WITHIN THE

COMMUNITY EMPLOYMENT PROGRAM, SPECIAL PRIORITY IS

GIVEN TO REGIONS OF HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT SUCH AS NEWCASTLE,

WOLLONGONG AND WHYALLA,

IN ORDER TO ACCOMMODATE THE NEW EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING

PROGRAMS ANNOUNCED ON 19 MAY, WE WERE FORCED TO MAKE

SOME SIGNIFICANT OFF-SETTING CUTS IN SOME OF THE PREVIOUS

GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAMS. NOT TO HAVE DONE THIS WOULD HAVE

PLACED INTOLERABLE BURDENS ON THE GOVERNMENT'S MONETARY

POLICY AND PUT SERIOUS PRESSURE ON INTEREST RATES. THE

EFFECT THIS WOULD HAVE HAD ON PRIVATE SECTOR SPENDING

WOULD HAVE UNDONE ALL THE BENEFITS OF THE REFLATIONARY

ASPECTS OF THE GOVERNMENT'S POLICIES.

IN MAKING CUTBACKS WE HAVE BEEN CONCERNED TO ENSURE

THAT THEY AFFECT THOSE MOST ABLE TO SHOULDER THE BURDEN.

10

THOSE OF US WITH JOBS MUST EXERCISE RESTRAINT IN OUR

INCOME CLAIMS, JOB CREATION AND INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE

PROGRAMS WILL SIMPLY BE USELESS IF LABOUR COSTS ARE

ALLOWED TO GET OUT OF CONTROL,

WAGE RESTRAINT IS ESSENTIAL IF WE ARE TO MAINTAIN A

VIABLE INDUSTRIAL BASE AND CREATE MORE JOBS. BUT THE

GOVERNMENT RECOGNISES THAT WAGE RESTRAINT BY ITSELF

WOULD BE GROSSLY INEQUITABLE,

THE PRICES AND INCOMES ACCORD IS NOT JUST ABOUT WAGE

RESTRAINT. IT DEALS WITH A WHOLE RANGE OF OTHER

MEASURES NECESSARY TO IMPROVE AUSTRALIA'S SOCIAL AND

ECONOMIC WELL-BEING, THE GOVERNMENT HAS ALREADY TAKEN

ACTION IN MANY OF THESE AREAS!

- WE HAVE INTRODUCED LEGISLATION TO ESTABLISH AN

ECONOMIC PLANNING ADVISORY COUNCIL; '

- WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF ESTABLISHING A PRICES

SURVEILLANCE AUTHORITY;

- WE ARE TAKING ACTION TO RESTRAIN NON-WAGE INCOMES,

SUCH AS PROFESSIONAL FEES, DIVIDENDS AND DIRECTORS

REMUNERATION;

- WE HAVE INTRODUCED LEGISLATION AS PART OF OUR

POLICY TO SMASH THE TAX AVOIDANCE INDUSTRY;

11.

WE HAVE INTRODUCED LEGISLATION TO FACILITATE THE

AMALGAMATION OF UNIONS AND TO ABOLISH THE

INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS BUREAU;

WE HAVE REDUCED THE CEILING FOR MIGRATION FOR

1983-84 t o b e t w e e n  80,000 a n d 90,000, w i t h i n

THIS GLOBAL FIGURE THERE WILL BE A SHIFT IN

EMPHASIS TOWARDS THE REUNION OF CLOSE FAMILY

MEMBERS OF AUSTRALIAN CITIZENS AND TO REFUGEES,

AND AWAY FROM THE RECRUITMENT OF SKILLED WORKERS

OVERSEAS; Ã¢ÂÂ  Â· Â·

THIS GOVERNMENT IS CONCERNED ABOUT EQUITY AND

THE INTERESTS OF ORDINARY AUSTRALIANS. BUT WE

CAN ONLY SUCCEED IN OUR OBJECTIVES IF WE HAVE

THE SUPPORT OF THE COMMUNITY AT LARGE AND, IN

PARTICULAR, THE TRADE UNION MOVEMENT.
