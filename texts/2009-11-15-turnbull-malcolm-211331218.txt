Sun, 15th November 2009   TURNBULL INTERVIEW WITH LAURIE OAKES - EMISSIONS TRADING  SCHEME, KEVIN RUDD’S FAILED BORDER PROTECTION POLICIES

The Hon Malcolm Turnbull MP   Leader of the Opposition

E&OE

LAURIE OAKES:

Mr Turnbull, welcome.

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Good morning Laurie.

LAURIE OAKES:

And you know you don’t need the metal jacket. Everyone knows I’m a pussycat.

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Yes, that’s right. You’re just a nice furry fellow there.

LAURIE OAKES:

It look as though the Coalition has had a big win with the Government announcing it’s  prepared to exclude agriculture from the emissions trading system indefinitely. Do  you see that as a victory?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Well it is certainly a key part of our set of amendments that we put to the Government  to exclude permanently agricultural emissions, direct emissions from agriculture, in  line with what is being done in the United States and Europe, and also, equally  importantly, to include agricultural offsets so that farmers and other landowners are  able to generate carbon credits by more sustainable use of their land, by  environmental forestry, with biochar, increasing soil carbon. And of course that offers  for farmers in particular, as it already is doing in America, a very substantial  additional source of income. So it is good for the environment and it is good for the  farmers.

LAURIE OAKES:

What the Government seems to be saying, although we haven’t seen the detail yet,  they seem to be saying that they will look at, they will examine this question of offsets  for farmers. Will that be good enough for you?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Well Laurie, let’s wait and see what they come up with. In the United States, for  example, agricultural offsets are being specifically legislated for. In the Waxman-Markey Bill that has been through the House of Reps over there there is actually quite  a long list of them. Anyway I don’t want to run a commentary on the negotiations or

give forecasts of where they are going to end up. We are having constructive  negotiations with the Government. Ian Macfarlane is doing a great job for our side.  They are constructive talks, they will reach a conclusion and then we will make a  decision.

LAURIE OAKES:

Well one newspaper today is saying that this concession by the Government means  that we are likely to have an emissions trading system deal locked up by the end of  next week. Are they going too far or is it that good?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Well comment is free and facts are sacred, so I will leave the commentators to make  whatever free opinions they like. And we will just deal with the facts. We will find  out where the Government, how far the Government is prepared to come in  addressing our amendments and then we will, as an opposition, make a decision.

LAURIE OAKES:

Assuming that the Government is giving you what you want on agriculture, is that the  only potential deal breaker or are there other potential stumbling blocks?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Laurie, sorry, I couldn’t hear any of that last question. Could you just ask that again?  There was some interference here.

LAURIE OAKES:

Yeah, I was saying that assuming the Government is giving you what you want on  agriculture, is that the only potential deal breaker or could there be other stumbling  blocks in the negotiations?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Laurie, there are a range of very important matters raised in the amendments. I have  made a deliberate decision not to say what is a deal breaker, what is more important,  what is less important. The negotiations have been conducted constructively and, I  might say, confidentially between the Government and the Opposition and they will  reach a conclusion and then we will make a decision.

LAURIE OAKES:

How confident are you that if Ian Macfarlane does negotiate a deal with the  Government, one that you accept, how confident are you that the Coalition party room  will go along with it?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Well Laurie, I am confident that you, despite your claim to be a pussycat at the  beginning, are as persistent and tenacious as a bulldog because you are asking me the  same question again and again, and I will just give you the same answer which is we  will let the negotiations take their course. They are proceeding in good faith and at the

end we will make a decision. We have got to look at the whole package that can be  agreed on.

LAURIE OAKES:

But it’s not the same question, of course. If a package is agreed on, then are you  confident it will get through the party room? You did stake your leadership on this  after all.

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Well Laurie, let me just be quite clear about this. We will discover at the end of the  negotiations how far the Government is prepared to go to address the amendments  that we have proposed. That will be considered by Shadow Cabinet which will then  take a recommendation to the party room which will, of course, make the final  decision and anything else beyond that is just speculation to which, I might say, you  are perfectly entitled, but as the Leader of the Opposition I am not going to engage in  that speculation.

LAURIE OAKES:

Except that you did spark a lot of it when you put your leadership on the line. Now  there has been a recent analysis…

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

But Laurie again, with respect, we should be talking about some other issues this  morning other than this but let me just say this to you. The issue that I was concerned  about and which I said was a leadership issue was the question whether we would  engage in constructive negotiations with the Government and take amendments to  them. The party room supported me overwhelmingly on that, overwhelmingly. And  the negotiations are going ahead. I have not made any commitment, personally or on  behalf of the party, as to whether we will support the outcome of those negotiations or  not because we don’t know what the negotiations will be. Obviously if the  Government agreed to everything, I would recommend we support it. If they agreed to  nothing, I would recommend we oppose it. But we all know that the outcome is going  to be somewhere in the middle, so let’s not speculate about that. Let’s see what it is  and then we will decide how we vote.

LAURIE OAKES:

But if a large slab of Liberal senators vote against you in the Senate, wouldn’t that  bring your leadership into question? I mean could you live with that humiliation?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

You would be amazed what politicians can live with, Laurie - look I can even live  with you going on and on about this so tediously.

Look, Laurie, at the moment - just leaving the ETS for a second - at the moment we  are witnessing another colossal policy failure on the part of the Rudd Government. I  mean, our border protection policy is a shambles. He is offering special deals to get  people off the Oceanic Viking, 22 out of 78. Another boat has arrived overnight with

nearly 50 people on it. That is 49 boats and over 2,200 unauthorised asylum seekers  since Kevin Rudd abandoned the policies of the previous government that were  working. This is a colossal failure in border protection. If you talk about humiliation,  how humiliated is Kevin Rudd to be having to offer special deals, begging these  people to leave an Australian Government vessel and he has only be able to get 22 out  of the 78 off. He is offering them a better deal than they would have received in terms  of access to Australia than if they had arrived at Christmas Island. This is an  extraordinary and humiliating episode in our border protection history. It is a colossal  failure.

LAURIE OAKES:

Look I do want to talk about that in more detail but it was Nick Minchin who on Four  Corners said, ‘hey, don’t forget about ETS and the Liberal Party’s division’, so let me  ask you a couple more questions on that. How confident are you that if you get a deal  with the Government on the ETS that Nick Minchin will vote with you in the Senate?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Nick and I speak together a lot about all of these issues. Nick is the Leader in the  Senate, he is a member of the Shadow Cabinet and he understands the importance of  cabinet solidarity. So if the Shadow Cabinet agrees on a course of action and that is  then endorsed by the party room, then every member of the Shadow Cabinet supports  it. That goes without saying.

LAURIE OAKES:

Even though he thinks that the idea that humans have caused global warming is a vast  leftwing conspiracy?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Cabinet solidarity means that we agree on a position and then we all stick to it.

LAURIE OAKES:

Okay. Well, asylum seekers. As you say, that is the big issue and I have been very  critical of Kevin Rudd and his management of this. Another boat has been intercepted  off Ashmore Reef and the Indonesians have stopped a boat with Afghanis aboard and  been involved in some sort of gunfight. Do you think you are on an election, potential  election winner with this issue?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Well Laurie, I am not interested in… that aspect is something, again, for you to write  about it if you want to. The real issue here is that Kevin Rudd has comprehensively  failed the Australian people. Every Australian government, Labor or Liberal, has an  obligation to keep our borders secure and have policies that do the utmost to stamp  out people smuggling and prevent and discourage unauthorised arrivals of people  smugglers. What Kevin Rudd has done is roll out the Rudd carpet and no, Laurie, I’m  not speaking New Zealand. He has rolled out the Rudd carpet to these people. He has  sent a big signal which says Australia is open, our borders are open. And what we are

seeing is a rising surge in unauthorised arrivals because of his softening of our  policies. He said he could do all that and it would have no effect. Well he has been  proved comprehensively wrong. He has got to admit that his policy has failed and do  something about it.

LAURIE OAKES:

Malcolm Fraser says you’re after the redneck vote or maybe I should say the  Ruddneck vote.

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Well I understand that not everyone will agree with the position I take and there will  be critics. But leadership is about making tough decisions. Kevin Rudd hasn’t made  any tough decisions. We have to be firm in our resolve to protect our borders. Let me  just make this point, Laurie. Let’s just look at this coldly and objectively. The people  smugglers are criminals but they are in business. They are asking their potential  customers for 10, 15 thousand dollars to secure a seat on their boat and they are  offering them a product and that product is the near certainty of permanent residence  in Australia.

Now what Kevin Rudd has done has made that product more attractive and this is why  the Sri Lankan Ambassador to the UN, the Indonesian Ambassador, the Federal  Police, the International Organization on Migration are all saying that it is Kevin  Rudd’s policies that have increased that pull factor. So that is why we have said we  will - if returned to office - we will establish a safe haven visa that will mean that a  person who comes in an unauthorised way as an asylum seeker, and is proved to be a  refugee, will be given protection but that their status will be reviewed not later than  three years and if it is found that the country from which they fled is no longer in a  condition such that they could reasonably fear the risk of persecution, then they would  be repatriated. What…

LAURIE OAKES:

The Government…

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

The Government says…

LAURIE OAKES:

The Government says temporary protection visas didn’t work last time and they won’t  work this time.

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Well Laurie, the Government said that unpicking the Coalition’s border protection  policy wouldn’t have any effect on the number of boat arrivals. They got that  comprehensively wrong. I think the one thing that we know is that the previous  government’s policies worked. And we have got to be rational about this. The people  smuggler is selling a product. That product is a certainty of permanent residency in  Australia. If we make that product less certain then fewer people will part with 10 or

15 thousand dollars to get on the boat, there will be fewer boats, fewer unauthorised  arrivals. And what I have proposed is entirely consistent with the UN Convention on  Refugees, it is fair, it is humane, it is just, but what it does do is undermine the  marketing efforts of these criminal businesses, these people smuggling businesses and  unless we do that, we are not going to be able to stop this surge.

LAURIE OAKES:

Your announcement has caused some dissension in your party. Petro Georgiou said  protection visas are a cruel response to genuine refugees. Senator Judith Troeth says  your proposed safe haven visa will be even worse than the Howard Government  model because it would give less security and certainty.

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

I don’t think either of those comments are correct. They are entitled to their view. I  recognise leadership is about taking tough decisions. You cannot please everybody all  of the time the way Kevin Rudd tries to do. He has tried to do that with immigration  and he has failed.

LAURIE OAKES:

But why didn’t you take this to the party room for discussion before announcing it?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Laurie, we have discussed this issue all the time in the party room and I know the  mind of the party room and the measures that we announced on Friday have the  support of the overwhelming majority of the party room. There is no doubt about that.

LAURIE OAKES:

But you can’t say boo about an emissions trading system without going to the party  room because the right wing is keeping an eye on you. Is it only issues that are  sensitive to the right wing that go to the party meeting?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Well Laurie, it is new policies and developing policies, and the fact of the matter is  the emissions trading scheme is a developing situation. You have seen the  Government announce some very significant changes today. You have got to  remember, just on that, it is not so long ago that the Agriculture Minister Tony Burke  said that our proposals on agriculture were “too good to be true”. Well now, if the  press is to be believed, the Government accepts that they are not simply true but good  policy. Anyway, we will see what they come up with.

LAURIE OAKES:

I hate to point out that you’re the one who just took us off asylum seekers back to the  ETS.

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

Well there you go you see, but because you have been such an affable pussycat this  morning I thought I should give you a bit of lead in there.

LAURIE OAKES:

Okay. Now you have said that Kevin Rudd has given a special deal to the Tamils on  the Oceanic Viking. He denies that. What should he have done to get these people off  the ship? Isn’t it better to coax them off the ship with offers rather than use force?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

He should have told the truth. The fact is he did offer them a special deal. That is  clear. The evidence is in writing. The Indonesian Government has confirmed that. So  what he has said about not offering them a special deal is simply untrue. As to the  method of getting them off the ship, the fact is the Government has refused to give us  a briefing on it so I can’t give you an informed opinion about what would have been  the best technique. But just bear this in mind, it was Kevin Rudd who said he had a  deal whereby they could disembark in Indonesia but he obviously failed to give any  consideration as to how to get them off the ship. What does that say about his  judgment? What does it say about his competence?

LAURIE OAKES:

Final question, I notice a News Limited reporter today is saying that we are entering  the political killing season, the time of the year when leaders normally get knocked  off. Are you feeling uncomfortable, watching your back?

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

I am feeling very comfortable and, as you said, I didn’t need the full metal jacket this  morning and I don’t need a full metal jacket at any time.

LAURIE OAKES:

Mr Turnbull, we thank you.

MALCOLM TURNBULL:

It is great to be with you, Laurie.
