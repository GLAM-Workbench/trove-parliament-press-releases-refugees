RAY HADLEY:

We've got him now, the Immigration Minister Peter Dutton. Little gremlin's been  fixed. Minister, good morning.

PETER DUTTON:

That's better, thanks Ray. How are you?

RAY HADLEY:

Very well, thank you.

Now, you are mopping up - you're the man with a mop and bucket on 457 visa  holders and inexplicably as your colleague Scott Morrison pointed out during Alan's  programme this morning, introduced by Chris Bowen, then Immigration Minister and  Bill Shorten, Workplace Relations Minister, that fast food outlets - and they've been  named up hill and down dale, they've done nothing wrong - were allowed to bring  500 people from other parts of the world to work in fast food restaurants and you're  stopping it as of today.

PETER DUTTON:

Well that's right, Ray. I can't understand why we would knock Aussie kids back from  getting a job at a local fast food outlet or at a local business and replace that young  Australian worker with an overseas worker. It just makes no sense to me.

So look, it's taking it's time to work through the mess in the Immigration portfolio that  Labor presided over. Obviously we've stopped boats and we're working through the  Immigration programme.

My proposal is very simple; that is that I want Aussie kids to get a job. That was my  experience. I started work in a butcher shop when I was quite young after school and  Saturday mornings and what not. I think it is a great thing for children, for young  adults, teenagers to get a part time job. I think it teaches them respect towards  customers and customer service, it builds confidence, creates a work ethic early on  and that's my judgment.

I think it's unimaginable that in areas where we might have 14, 15 per cent for  example unemployment rate for young people, that we're allowing companies to  bring foreign workers in. I've stopped that and there are other aspects of Labor's 457  programme that I'm working on tidying up at the moment as well.

RAY HADLEY:

Now look, you mention young people working. Macca's, KFC and Hungry Jack's  have a great history of doing that. They've been allowed to do this via the previous  Labor Government and I understand that people who are currently here under that  system will simply not have their visa renewed as it expires, so they'll be sent back  from whence they came no doubt.

But my concern is there's a suggestion today that it was introduced under the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd Government because they wanted to target regional centres who were  finding it hard to find workers at these fast food restaurants. If in fact we've got  unemployment rates of 20 or 25 per cent in those centres, why in God's name  wouldn't we be saying to people on the Centrelink, listen, there's a job down there at  Macca's flipping burgers, get your bum down there and get into work, as opposed to  you know go to Centrelink and pick up your money?

PETER DUTTON:

Of course. People work hard for their money. People pay taxes and they expect their  taxes to be spent wisely and there are people who believe they can take advantage  of the system, young people who don't want to work and I want to make sure that we  can provide every assistance to people who have worked hard all of their lives,  contributed to our country. They're the people we should prioritise and take care of  first and if people believe that they can take advantage of the welfare system, then  this Government's not going to tolerate it.

I think - as you rightly point out - if you've got a young person there that is  unemployed and there's a job going down at McDonald's or KFC or whatever, they  should take it. These companies are good companies, but they will take…you know  they will work within the laws that are provided and for whatever reason, Bill  Shorten's union, the AWU and others, signed off on these arrangements that were  put in place by the Labor Government, by Chris Bowen at the time - I can't  understand actually how Chris Bowen found time to stuff up the 457 programme  when he was processing boats like they were going out of fashion - he was a busy,  busy man, but just not in the right direction.

RAY HADLEY:

You mentioned just then in passing that you're tidying up a whole range of things in  457 and I've got emails from people saying at my local shopping centre they're  employing 457 visa holders and maybe at butcher shops and other places as well. Is  the suggestion that it's open to abuse by a whole range of industry, not just fast  food?

PETER DUTTON:

Ray there's no doubt that some people will take advantage of this system. There are  some areas; remote areas, rural areas, where genuinely they can't get local staff for  whatever reason and...

RAY HADLEY:

…well interrupting, I mentioned I travelled to Roma in your home state a couple of  years ago and met the proprietor of the local jewellery store who introduced me to  his jeweller who's from Ireland, with his wife and he for the life of him couldn't get a  jeweller to come from Brisbane or Sydney to work in Roma. So he got this bloke on a  457. The bloke wants to come here - great jeweller apparently - and so that solves  the problem for Roma and for that jeweller and surely we can keep doing that, but  not when it can be fulfilled by another person.

PETER DUTTON:

We could look at individual cases in particular areas, but this arrangement that was  put in place was sort of a carte blanche approach and it needed to be tightened up.  Obviously the agreements continue on for a few years and as some have come to  expire etc. then I've been made aware of companies that have made new  applications and I've brought an end to it. I believe we should put Australian workers  first. That's what we're doing here and it's what we're going to continue to do.

RAY HADLEY:

Just on one other - and I may have raised this without having the full details -  Pauline Hanson spoke to me some time ago and then I got an email from a listener  in Mackay. It says Australian ships are bringing in 457 visas to work as marine  engineers despite 148 Australians currently being listed as able to do the jobs.

Now, the answer I got back - and not from you, but I'm just checking with you, the  veracity of it - that the Maritime Union of Australia has made it almost impossible to  employ Australians to do their job because of the demands they make about, not  necessarily wage, but you know how many days you've got to have off after being so  many days at sea.

PETER DUTTON:

Ray, well, as I understand it, there's a bit of turf warfare going on between some of  the unions associated with the waterfront, including the MUA, as you say and I mean  the MUA's got a, you know, a well credentialed past and it's not a pretty one.

It's beyond me that as an island nation we haven't been able to build one of the best  shipping industries in the world, but when you look at the practices of the MUA  bosses, it's the same as the CFMEU bosses; they take these decisions somehow  that they don't want to grow the industry, they don't want more members, they just  want to make sure that the union bosses are taken care of and they price  themselves out of the market.

The reality is that these ships are sailing around the world, they're competing with  international crews etc, like any business, like any airline that's competing overseas  or the sale of any product that's made here in Australia and exported overseas, that's  the market in which they operate, and yet they have made it almost impossible for  industry to employ more people within the shipping industry. It's on its last legs in  many cases and it's just beyond my comprehension as to why they would want to  destroy what should be a vibrant industry.

RAY HADLEY:

Now, you and I have spoken previously about Alex Vella. He's been left in Malta  thanks to your predecessor Scott Morrison which continues on with you today. The  ABC did a very sympathetic article about a bloke who was a member of the  Comancheros, I think from Adelaide, who you're sending back to the UK. His name  is Paul Burgess. He's 33. You've sent him or you will send him packing as part of all  of this. The ABC's very sympathetic to Outlaw Motorcycle Gangs apparently and this  particular fella they say that he's been here since he was two, 31 years, pleading for  him to remain here. Yes, he was a member of the Comancheros outlaw motorbike  club, but his family says he's no longer a bikie, but of course he's had a list of  convictions as long as your arm for a whole range of things. Is he still going back to  his native UK?

PETER DUTTON:

Ray, I just can't comment on an individual case.

But I mean in terms of the number of visas, as you know, I mean I've cancelled about  138 visas I think of Outlaw Motorcycle Gang members and I think the numbers up to  about that, 2,000 overall over the last couple of years, it's up by 1400 per cent and  we are targeting serious criminals.

Now, I don't want to make a comment about this particular case because I'm a  decision maker and these cases end up in court, so I don't want to prejudice that, but  it could only be our ABC that sides with Outlaw Motorcycle Gangs over the public  that pay their wages. It's similar to the Keysar Trad issue last week and I see in  Senate Estimates yesterday that they were apologising - the ABC was apologising  for the fact that as we predicted on your show, they wouldn't cover the Keysar Trad  comments about condoning domestic violence against women.

RAY HADLEY:

Well, they got outed by their own Media Watch apparently which I don't watch - I  feature on it many times - but apparently Media Watch pointed at the fact that  neither SBS or the ABC said a word about it. Not one word.

PETER DUTTON:

It's beyond me. I mean anybody else that would be condoning or suggesting violence  against women is okay would have been hung out to dry and the ABC needs to  provide frankly a proper explanation because there is, as we know, a hell of a  cultural problem with some of these journalists who are at the ABC and The  Guardian and elsewhere and they need to explain their actions because they're  using, in the ABC's case, public dollars.

And again back to the same principle - taxpayers have worked hard for that money  and the ABC should be explaining why they decide not to focus on what was a  stupid, terrible statement.

RAY HADLEY:

Just finally, old mate Bob Katter got up in Question Time yesterday demanding a  Donald Trump-style Muslim travel ban. Now, in relation to Young and we can't  comment on the arrest of a person in Young, other than to say he's been charged  with very serious terrorism related offences, but I feel a bit sorry - and I know many  Muslim people who are fantastic contributors to rural and city communities - the  locals tell me in Young that over the past 20 years Muslim people have come there,  they've participated in service clubs, they're part of the community. They're a bit  concerned about recent additions in the Muslim community. They've come from  Western and Southwestern Sydney to Young. But in relation to Bob demanding a  Muslim travel ban on mass, your reaction to that please?

PETER DUTTON:

Well as you saw yesterday, President Trump singled Australia and Canada out for  special mention in his speech and he complimented Australia on the system that  we've got. I think many countries are looking to our system to try and implement or  replicate it because we have got one of the most successful migration programmes  in the world. We have got probably the strongest border protection policies in the  world and in the 21st century you must have that because as we've seen in Europe  we've got people slipping into the refugee queues who want to cause terrorist  attacks. So you've got to be serious about it.

Now we've always concentrated on the threat and if there are threats within the  Islamic community, if there are threats in applications coming out of any part of the  world we stop that. So we don't have a discriminatory policy and we shouldn't.

What's important here Ray is that we call out those people who are doing the wrong  thing or who are preaching in a way that they would advocate violence. They are the  people who sadly are defining the rest of the community and the one per cent  defining the 99 per cent is not acceptable and we need to come down hard.

And the ABC, as they demonstrated the other day, didn't want to make any comment  about Keysar Trad even though he was talking about domestic violence against  women being condoned in certain circumstances.

Now, we need to be honest and have a fair dinkum debate about these matters. If  people are, in Young, doing the wrong thing they should be called out, but the one or  two or 10, whatever the number is, that are defining the other 400 who are working  at the abattoirs, keeping the business going because again they can't get Australian  workers there for whatever reason - the farmers wouldn't be sending their beef to  market, to the abattoirs if it wasn’t for this local work force.

So we've got to have an honest debate and speak frankly about it and call out the  bad element, but don't allow the bad element to define the majority of people who  are working hard, educating their kids and share the same values as you and I.

RAY HADLEY:

Now your Border Force people and West Australian Police and AFP have done a  good job. News just in, along with Michael Keenan, you're announcing that 50  workers who were here illegally have been netted in that part of Australia.

PETER DUTTON:

I want to say thanks to the officers of the Australian Border Force, the West  Australian Police and the Australian Federal Police. They've really done a great job  here.

The Government's priority is to make sure that we don't have Australian workers  being displaced by foreign workers, but where we do have foreign workers here  picking fruit for example, I'm not going to tolerate them being exploited.

So this is the latest raid that's been conducted by Operation Cadena and we've  spoken about some of their raids previously. So some of the labour hire companies  need to hear very clearly these raids are going to continue, these investigations will  continue and if you're exploiting workers you can expect to be prosecuted by the  Government.

RAY HADLEY:

Just reminded by a listener, one thing I didn't ask you about and I should have…  service stations. We mentioned 457 visa holders, are they part of an investigation? If  we're going to have a look at fast food, do we know how many people are working in  service stations across Australia on 457 visas?

PETER DUTTON:

I don't have that number Ray. But if I can find it, if it's available, I'll send it through to  you.

RAY HADLEY:

Okay, I'd appreciate it. Thanks very much.

PETER DUTTON:

Thanks mate.
