MINISTERS TO. DISCUSS. MIGRATION RESURGENCE

A marked resurgence of interest in migration to AustÂ­

ralia will be one of the major topicsÂ· of discussion for

Commonwealth and State Immigration and Ethnic Affairs Ministers

at a conference in Darwin on 18 April.

Excluding refugees and trans-Tasman movements,  the

increase in both migration inquiries and applications overseas

is running at some 30 per cent over the same period of last year.

During the first six months of the current financial

year settler arrivals were 38 008, 12 per cent more than the

same period last year. Â·

The major sources of settlers for the half year were .

United Kingdom and Ireland, Asia, Northern Europe and New

Zealand.

Ministers also will discuss proposals for a Government

campaign to enhance the value, prestige and significance of

Australian citizenship.

Other agenda items include the current arrangements for

inter-country adoptions;  the role of local Government in

settlement services for migrants;  and the major implications of .

current population development. .

The meeting will be chaired by the Commonwealth

Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Mr Macphee and willÂ·

be attended by the New Zealand Minister of Labour and Immigration,

Mr Bolger.
