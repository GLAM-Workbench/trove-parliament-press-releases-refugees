KEYNOTE ADDRESS BY               MR KEVIN RUDD, SHADOW MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS

Introduction by Ron Weiser, President, Zionist Federation of Australia

Dr Weiser introduced the Shadow Foreign Minister, Kevin Rudd.  Below is the transcript of his  introductory remarks:

“Australia has a proud and long-standing record of bi-partisan support for the State of Israel.  We recall the Labor Party's then Foreign Minister, Doc Evatt and his Chairmanship of the  Partition Vote at the United Nations on the 29th November, 1947.  We note also that the bi-partisan support extends to Israel's security whilst at the same time, recognising the need to deal  justly with the aspirations of the Palestinians.

We do hear great words from some members of the ALP, people like Michael Danby, Senators  Forshaw, Hutchins and others, but we also hear others who call Israel a 'rogue state'.  We also  see Anthony Albanese marching in Palestinian rallies in Sydney, while elements of the crowd  carry Hizbollah and Hamas flags and others have their children wearing plastic suicide vests.

I look forward to hearing tonight the clear and precise recognition that we do hear from the Prime  Minister and the Foreign Minister, of the following three points:

1. That the barriers and realisation of this bi-partisan position is precisely that there is no  visible Palestinian leadership that is willing to accept a State for their own people  alongside Israel, but rather seeks to have their State instead of Israel.

Yasser Arafat's strategy is not to win Palestinian freedom, but to deny Israel's freedom.   The long-term goal is not to establish a Palestinian State, but to destroy the Jewish State.

We need to hear clear and unambiguous recognition from our Australian leaders that  Israel accepted partition in 1947, offered it again in 1967 and again in 2000 at Camp  David and each time, sadly, Abba Eban's dictum was proven correct that "the Arabs have  never missed an opportunity to miss an opportunity".

And this desire for peace and willingness to make painful concessions for peace are  exemplified by the current Prime Minister of Israel, who enjoys the support of the vast  majority of the Israeli people and a truly huge majority in the Knesset.  I remind you all of  Prime Minister Sharon's words on 23 September 2001 in his historic speech at Latrun.

He said "The State of Israel wants to give the Palestinians what no-one else has  heretofore given them:  the possibility of establishing a State.  Neither the Turks, the  English, the Egyptians nor the Jordanians gave them such a possibility".  Prime Minister  Sharon continues:  "All that Israel has asked and Arafat has committed himself to this  continually in empty promises, is to stop terrorism, to live in peace, to live in calm".

So we need to hear that it is time for the Palestinians to stop the terror and to return to  the negotiating table, that it is they who chose violence over dialogue.

2. That there can be no moral equivalence.  Terrorism is terrorism.  We know what it is.  It is  the deliberate targeting of innocent civilians and tragically we saw it manifest itself once  again in Bali this weekend.  It is not freedom fighting.  One man's terrorist can never be  another's freedom fighter.



Freedom fighters do not blow up buses containing non-combatants.  Terrorist murderers  do.  Freedom fighters do not blow up pizza parlours and discotheques and night clubs.   Terrorist murderers do.  Terrorists do not aim to build anything whatsoever, but just to  destroy.

The Bali bombers did not exist in a vacuum and they are no different from the bombers  Israel faces.  These terrorists are nurtured and are dispatched. Whether we like to admit  it or not, today's terrorists, whether they be Hamas, Hizbollah, JI, Al Qaeda, Islamic  Jihad, Moslem Brotherhood, etc., etc., are Muslim fundamentalists.  They are State

STATE ZIONIST COUNCIL ANNUAL ASSEMBLY, 15 OCTOBER 2002

sponsored, and State supported and State funded and State encouraged.  And it is not  limited to The Sudan, or to Libya or to Syria or to Iran or to Saudi Arabia or to Iraq or to  the Palestinian Authority and so on, and so on.

Islamic fundamentalism is a totalitarian, despotic, hate-filled, venomous ideology, based  on a fight between it and the infidel - that is, everyone else.  And be not mistaken,  everyone else.  And it is not a passing aberration and it not something that one can  negotiate with.  Islamic fundamentalism is a fight against modernity, a fight against  freedom, a fight against democracy and a fight against civil rights.

3. The true recognition of what Israel being the only democracy in the Middle East really  means.  The fact that there is a freely elected leadership, that there is an independent  judiciary and that there is a free and vibrant and critical press.  And the fact that these are  not just words.



They invest a nation with responsibilities and privileges and values and morality.  And  they shape a society that a non-democratic entity can not even begin to understand, nor  conform to nor act in accordance with and therefore, wishes to destroy.

There needs to be a recognition that Israel's one million Arab citizens ironically enjoy  more rights in Israel than Arab citizens do in Arab countries.  And there has to be a  recognition of the corruption, the moral decay and the incitement, the baseless, evil,  racist, rank anti-Semitic incitement and anti-Western incitement and anti-democratic  incitement in the Palestinian controlled press, the Palestinian controlled education system  and throughout the mosques in the West Bank and Gaza and indeed in many parts of the  Arab world and yes, sadly, even in some places here in Australia today.

Friends, the Australian Jewish community needs to be able to take comfort from the fact  that our Australian leaders understand terror, reject moral equivalence and have empathy  with the only democracy in the Middle East, as she continues her search for peace in a  neighbourhood of despotism, dictatorship and corruption.

There needs to be a determined wall-to-wall coalition against terror.  These terrorists  attack democracy because democracy guarantees individual liberty.  Those who treasure  freedom must unite and do so now.  The time for even-handedness when it comes to  terrorism has ended.  This terrorism targets all of us.

I am reminded of those famous words that "all it takes for evil to succeed is for good men  to remain silent".

Ladies and Gentlemen,

Kevin Rudd is a Queenslander who has served Australia as a diplomat in Stockholm and  Beijing and who then went on to become Chief of Staff of the Queensland Labor Party  and see them into government for the first time in 32 years.  He was elected to Federal  Parliament in 1998.  Mr Rudd is an erudite spokesperson who has a reputation as an  intelligent and analytical thinker.  It gives me great pleasure to call upon Kevin Rudd,  Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs to address us this evening.”





Thank you very much, thank you Ron Weiser for the least political introduction I have ever received.  I  should try that in my own electorate.  What a very effective introduction it was.

Ambassador Gabby Levy, it's good to see you here this evening, from Canberra and when I did attend  Israel's national day, I did so as I describe.  I came from Brisbane for the event because my  recollection was at that time, that the State of Israel was under some international and national  duress.  And I'll do so again next year and the following year.

Distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, shalom, good evening.

It's with great pleasure that I address this evening the State Zionist Council of Victoria. I would  particularly like to thank the organisers of this evening's meeting for extending this invitation to me.  I  think it's entirely appropriate to thank in particular two people, Rachel Caplan and Philip Chester.

Rachel Caplan is the outgoing Director, as you know, of the State Zionist Council and her years of  dedicated service to this organisation have not gone unnoticed by Melbourne's Jewish community.

We wish her all the best, we are sure that incoming Director, Ms Ginette Searle, will emulate her good  work.  And Philip Chester, the outgoing President, has also been a great advocate of Victoria's Zionist  community and having listened to the paeons of praise about Philip Chester just before, I knew at that  very moment, that I was not in a branch meeting of the Australian Labor Party.  Because no-one ever

says anything that nice about the President, in the political culture that I come from.  I am sure that  you are always agreed on these questions - you're not.

I would also acknowledge my friend, Tony Lupton, who is the Labor candidate for the State seat of  Prahran in the upcoming elections and Mark Dreyfus, a friend who I see from time to time in  Canberra.  And other friends who may be in the audience who I just can't see from this vantage point.

Tonight we meet in the saddest of circumstances, as the Ambassador reminded us earlier on.  The  events of the past 72 hours have brought home to many Australians the vulnerability of this country's  citizens to the evil of terror.

I've just come from the House of Representatives in Canberra this afternoon, where I've just been  participating in a Parliamentary debate on this question and what we do from here.  It is the most  sombre mood that I have seen in the Australian Parliament in the four short years since I have been a  member.

For Australians, this is new.  For others, like Israel, it is not.  Terrorism, whatever its manifestation,  must be eliminated from the face of G-d's earth.  Terrorism is no respecter of boundaries, it is no  respecter of nationalities, it is no respecter of race, of rank, of religion.  In fact, there is something  desensitising about the very term "terrorism".   We use it so often, we hear it so often, it actually loses  its meaning.  Or when we hear it, it sometimes seems only in a clinical sense, as if it's some branch of  international relations theory.

Well, it's none of these things, and I think it's time we began to revise and renew our language when  we describe the phenomenon which currently has the name "terrorism" attached to it.  But terrorism  simply is this - it equals premeditated mass murder.  Nothing more.  Nothing less.  Premeditated mass  murder.  Just as suicide bombing is not suicide bombing - it is homicide bombing.  It is mass murder.

Tonight I'd like to talk about three things:

1.  Bali

2.  Iraq

3. Future developments in the broader Middle East as they relate to Israel, the Palestinian  Authority and the future peace process.

The 12th October has scarred this nation's mind.  It will scar this nation's memory and it will scar this  nation's soul.  We've all seen the television images of the last few days.  The awful truth is that we

KEVIN RUDD:

have been shielded from the worst of those images.  But the awful truth is that they are too awful to  show.  Those in Bali have seen it all.  And even if they have suffered no injury, their lives are changed  forever.  And so too, is the life of this nation changed.

11 September tempered us.  Exactly one year, one month and one day later, 12 October has seared  us and, in time, will steel us.  It has seared us as a nation.

There is but one response to terrorism and that is to confront it.  Not to cower from it, not to hide from  it, nor to be dictated by it.  But to confront it and to defeat it and to destroy it.  That is the common  mission of humanity.

That is why our parliamentary resolve in Canberra, to eliminate terrorism from the face of our planet,  has been fixed and steadfast these last 12 months, since September 11.  Certainly we must deal with  the causes of terrorism, for terrorism is fed by an array of political, economic and social  circumstances.  We know this.

This of itself however, will not eliminate terrorism from our regions.  Terrorism must also be dealt with  by force.  We are deluding ourselves if we think that dialogue and development represent the only  panaceas.  For they do not.  We must begin this task that we face today, by tracking down those  responsible for 12 October.  Bringing them to trial and bringing them to justice.  This country now  expects us to act and for the Parliamentarians of this country, those who make up the political  establishment of this country, for us to act with one heart, one mind and one voice.

Tracking down the perpetrators of 12 October requires extra resources and the Parliament of  Australia will grant those resources to the Government.  If the Government needs cooperation with  other governments across this region to bring those responsible for these acts to heel and to justice,  then the Parliament, to the extent that such cooperation is necessary, will provide it.

If the Government needs new inter-governmental arrangements with regional counter-parts that are  necessary to track down these terrorists, and these require the authority of the Parliament, then the  Parliament will give it.

For, in the business upon which we are about to embark, that is to bring to justice those who have  been murdered, we in the Australian Parliament are one.  On a day like this and in a week like this,  we are not Labor, we are not Liberal, we are not National, we are not Independents.  We are  Australians.

As I said in the House of Representatives today and I say here tonight - we support the actions of the  Australian Government.  We support the actions of the Australian Government in bringing to justice  those who have perpetrated these events.  We support the Australian Government's efforts to set up  a joint investigatory machinery with the Government of Indonesia to ensure that those who have done  these things are brought to justice.  And they do not just disappear through the cracks.  If this requires  bi-partisanship today, next week, next year and for the period ahead, then bi-partisanship shall be  delivered.  Because this has gone to the heart of what this nation has been and how we wish to be in  the future.

I have visited the headquarters of the Indonesian National Police in Jakarta.  These last several  years, I have visited Jakarta on six or seven occasions.  I do not know it well.  It is not the country of  my first familiarity, but I have begun to know it better.  We have a form of cooperation with Indonesia

which is reasonable.  The Australian Federal Police work well now with their Indonesian counter-parts.  But the quantum of cooperation now necessary between our respective constabularies will  have to expand by a quantum to meet the challenge which now lies before us.

The Prime Minister has said that we must now review our national and domestic security  arrangements and again, what I said in the Parliament today, is that we support him in that as well  because it is a good thing.

Beyond Australia, there is this further challenge.  How do we work with the Republic of Indonesia, the  world's largest Islamic country, to bring the perpetrators of this evil to justice?  The Australian  Government has in place a Memorandum of Understanding with the Indonesian authorities, on how to

bring about effective exchange of confidential and intelligence information.  That Memorandum of  Understanding has existed for barely 12 months.  It lies at the heart of the machinery between our two  countries on how to address the common problems of security between us.

But one positive development in the last day or so has been this.  The responsible Minister of  Government in Jakarta, an individual called Banban Uriano, whom I have met, he has stated for the  first time, unequivocally, on behalf of the Government of Indonesia, that this is a terrorist act.   Furthermore, the Defence Minister of Indonesia has stated equally unequivocally that this event in  Bali, that the activities of the organisation JI, have links, unequivocally, with Al Qaeda.

These are positive developments in the sense that anyone with a passing familiarity with domestic  Indonesian politics will know that this is a matter of rolling controversy within the Indonesian political  establishment.  That has been as it has been for some time.  I've met the Vice President of Indonesia,  Mr Hames Hertz.  I met him not in his current capacity but when he was a Minister under the

government of Mr Wadi.  Hames Hertz has a different view of these matters.  I'll leave it at that.

The encouraging development for us all here is that unequivocally and on public record in Indonesia,  we have resolved our express to the first time by senior ministers of that government that there are  terrorist organisations operating within the country.  That they are of a fundamentalist inclination and  there is an established link between some of those organisations and Al Maeda.  This is a step  forward.

However, recognition of the problem and action about it are separate matters.  Action must now  come.  And again, in the House of Representatives we said today, on behalf of the Parliamentary  Labor Party, we support and endorse the mission underlay this evening by my counter-part,  Alexander Downer, who has previously addressed your body here, as he travels to Jakarta to take  this to the next stage.  To take it to the next stage to ensure that work now happens on the ground to  bring not just the perpetrators of this event to justice, but to attack organised terrorism, root and  branch, across our region.  That is where the work must now occur.

There are three fundamentalist terrorist organisations at work in Indonesia.  They have been  mentioned in public debate.  They are Jemmy Islamiah, Luxa Jihad and so-called IDF.  The Prime  Minister has indicated today in Parliament that he will be seeking to have listed under the formal  provisions of the relevant international convention on terrorism, this organisation, JI.  Again in the  Parliament today, I said on behalf of the Parliamentary Opposition, that we support his actions 100%  in so doing.

We have also wished him G-d-speed and good work in convincing other members of the Team 5 in  New York and other relevant members of the United Nations, in order to get them to support this  particular initiative.  Let us be under no illusions.  As I said in the Parliament today, JI is a threat to  Australian security, a threat to Indonesian security and a threat to regional security.

The matter which arises from these events in Bali will be with us for a long time to come.  As you can  understand from watching your own television sets, the efforts of this country in the immediate period  ahead will be dedicated to the task of burying the dead, identifying the dead, bringing home the  wounded and tending to the families who are hurt.

Those things must occur now but the job of rooting out this evil will go on.  It is not just getting our bi-lateral arrangements with Jakarta right to do it, but across the broader region of South East Asia, the  challenges of people. That is why we have proposed the continuing spirit of bi-partrisanship on this  question with Simon Crean yesterday, who sends his regards to you one and all, personally.  He is a  loyal son of Melbourne and I know a good friend of many of you in this room (he will kill me for not  having said that at the beginning).

Why, he said in the Parliament yesterday that "where we now need to go is not just national resolve  within this country, not just a review of our domestic security, not just a more functional relationship  with Jakarta, to get to the bottom of these organisations within the country of Indonesia, but across all  of South East Asia, a summit of the five principal South East Asian States of Indonesia, Singapore,  Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines with one objective.  One standard objective across the region.

The elimination of terrorism in South East Asia.  That must be our common resolve."



When we turn to Iraq, Iraq represents a different challenge to security.  It represents a challenge to  global security.

I noted carefully what the Ambassador said earlier this evening when he said that "Israel does not lie  between the western world's problems with Iraq, although Israel itself has it' own problems with Iraq,  both in history and at present".



When it comes to Saddam Hussein, let me be abundantly clear.  There are no supporters, rational in  mind and sober in spirit, in this country, who could faintly be described as supporters of Saddam  Hussein.  The objective record speaks for itself.

First and foremost: Saddam Hussein is a mass murderer.  That is not a matter of conjecture.    It is a matter of empirical fact.  Second: Saddam Hussein possesses weapons of mass destruction.  That is a matter  of empirical fact.  If you don’t believe the intelligence assessments, you

simply read the most recent bulletin from the Federation of American  Scientists, which lists Iraq among a number of States in possession of  chemical, biological weapons and with the capacity to develop a nuclear  program.  Many of those States have concerns to the broader international  community.  Third: Saddam Hussein is unique among the above, has used weapons of mass

destruction against his own people we know in the north, and against  neighbouring Iran.

This person, Saddam Hussein is no Sunday school, Sabbath school teacher.  This is a seriously evil  dude.  Let us not pretend he is anything other than that.  The debate we are having in the  international community at the moment is not whether he has any of these attributes, the debate we  are having in the international community now is what we can do about this man.  What can we do  about his regime.

Let me be clear about what Labor policy is, so that people understand it clearly.  We framed our policy  in April this year, prior to Iraq becoming a matter of domestic, political controversy.

On Iraq we have said this:

First and foremost, the exhaustion of UN processes for the restoration of weapons inspectors with a  free and unfettered mandate in Iraq to complete the task assigned to them originally by the United  Nations Security Council, which is the elimination of all of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.  No  "ifs", no "buts", no "maybes", to complete execution of the brief.

Secondly, what we have said is this:  If Iraq fails to provide free and unfettered access to UN  Weapons Inspectors, then they must return to the UN Security Council for it to consider appropriate  action under the terms of the UN Charter, including Article 42 of the Charter, which is the provision of  the United Nations to deal with collective military action by member states.  And that is where the  matter would then go.

Well what Labor further says is this.  That if either of the above sets of circumstances are not  complete, that is, if Iraq fails to provide free and unfettered access to weapons inspectors and/or the  United Nations Security Council fails to act appropriately because it would effect its own resolutions,  then our side of politics says that as far as separate military action by the United States is concerned,  that there are provisions under Article 51 of the United Nations Charter which deal with anticipatory  self defence.

What we say under those provisions is this.  If it can be established that Iraq at some stage  represents a real and present danger to security under the terms of the Charter, by which we mean a  real and present danger in terms of its weapons of mass destruction, then under those circumstances,  consideration will be given.  I emphasise at this stage of the process, we are, in terms of the work in  New York and Washington and the other capitals, we are not yet at Stage 1.

But the evidence and emerging information from New York is that we will probably have a resolution  through the Council within the week to recommit weapons inspectors.

I said before that I would conclude with some remarks about Israel and the broader Middle East.

For the last two years, these two years of the 2nd Intifada have been an absolute tragedy.  A tragedy  both for the Palestinians and for the Israelis.  Not just because of the tragic loss of life or the grief  suffered by the families of the victims, but a terrible tragedy because of the lost opportunity by Yasser  Arafat, afforded to him by Ehud Barak at the Camp David Peace Talks.

The Camp David Peace Talks were a watershed for the Israeli and Palestinian people.  Not since the  Oslo Accords have the Israeli and the Palestinians come so close to peace.

It's worth re-capping, just briefly, what had been laid down by Barak:

ÃÂ¦ A Palestinian State alongside Israel, with its borders established by mutual agreement with  Israel.  ÃÂ¦ Israel's withdrawal from 95% of the West Bank.  ÃÂ¦ Israel to annex 5% of the West Bank in exchange for other territories, now under Israeli rule.  ÃÂ¦ Broad civil and administrative autonomy for Palestinians in the Old City of Jerusalem and the

neighbourhoods adjoining them.  ÃÂ¦ Separate Palestinian road access to the Temple Mount.  ÃÂ¦ Muslim administration of the Holy places.  ÃÂ¦ The right of Israel to deploy troops along the Jordan Valley in the event of a military threat

from the east  ÃÂ¦ Israeli acknowledgment of the suffering of the refugees and the absorption of tens of  thousands of Palestinian refugees in Israel under the banner of family reunification.  ÃÂ¦ And the creation of an international fund for the compensation and restitution of Palestinians

in their places of abode to which Israel would contribute.

Labor's view is simple.  This was a reasonable offer.  A bloody good offer and it is a tragedy that  Yasser Arafat's leadership did not allow him to accept the deal that was on offer.  Our view is simple.   The negotiation of a just, enduring and comprehensive peace between Israel and the Palestinians is

vital to the security in the Middle East and for international security.

In order for this to take place, Israeli security and Palestinian nationality must one day be able to co-exist.  I have a profound sense of personal solidarity with the experience of so many Israelis with the  horror and the phenomenon of suicide bombings as well as other forms of terrorism that have become  a distressing, devastating and regrettably regular part of Israeli life.  Such action cannot be tolerated.   All states have a right to self-defence.  No reasonable person can argue with that proposition.



The Palestinian people themselves have been devastated by these acts of terrorism but my colleague  in Canberra, and good friend, Michael Danby, has pointed out to me - he is Secretary of my  Parliamentary Caucus Committee on National Security - it has now been recognised by the leading  Palestinian editor, Nabil Amir, in the official Palestinian Authority newspaper, that the last two years  have been wasted, that more innocent blood has been spilled without any movement towards peace  and regrettably, if anything it appears at this stage that peace is as far away now as at any other point  since Oslo.

Part of moving the peace process on is encouraging reform also within the Palestinian Authority. The  Palestinian Authority needs to reform itself if progress is to be made.  An important part of the process  is the full democratisation of the Palestinian Assembly.  This is progressing, but more work must be  done.

If peace is ever to be a possibility, part of this change is a need to reduce the influence of Islamic  fundamentalists in this part of the world.  How is peace ever going to be possible, it is legitimately  asked, if Palestinian children are taught that all Jews and Israelis are evil and that children should

sacrifice themselves as suicide bombers?  This is not right.

The Palestinian people have a right to self-determination.  I welcome the fact that this is recognised  by Israel, by the United States and by both sides of politics in this country.  The challenge before us  all, as the Ambassador said before, is how do we get to that point?

The Oslo Accords, the Oslo process lies essentially dead.  But the proposal put forward at Camp  David II still holds and at the end there is hope.  Arafat rejected that proposal.  Perhaps what is  needed is an appropriately constituted international conference, involving the United States and  others.  To recast the Camp David, to negotiating a proposal into a form relevant to our current set of  circumstances.

If I could conclude by simply saying this:

I have mentioned before that Labor was instrumental at the birth of the State of Israel.  Foreign  Minister Evatt, who for many of us in Labor caucus is a man of inspiration, not just for his role in the  formation of modern Labor Foreign Policy but also for his role in the formation of the United Nations

and the protection of small states.  We honour his role also in the formation of the independent state  called the Republic of Indonesia.  We honour his role also in the formation of the State of Israel.

Labor policy has been, from the beginning, to support the continued viability of the State of Israel.   That policy will not change.  We will, from time to time, as will this Government, disagree with certain  aspects of the policy of the Government of Israel at any particular time.  That is a natural and normal  feature of international relations. That is to be expected.  But, when it comes to the fundamentals,  which is the right of the State of Israel to exist behind secure and defendable boundaries, Labor's  policy is rock solid, it has not changed from the beginning, it will not change in the future and for the  future, we also stand for this - assisting where we can, particularly if we are returned to Government,  to bring about a restoration of a peace process which delivers for Israel and for the Palestinians a  lasting and just peace but which delivers for Israel security, secure boundaries and a secure future.

ZFA President, Dr Ron Weiser invited questions to Mr Rudd:

From AUJS National Vice President, Ms Bianca Burd:

Despite living almost every day in fear and terror, Israel, her government and her people remain  committed to pursuing any meaningful and realistic path to peace for Israelis and Palestinians.  Can  you outline for us any pro-active and constructive role that the Australian government can play in  exerting pressure on the Palestinians to immediately cease the violence and return to the negotiating  table?

Mr Rudd's response:

There are two responses to that:

One, of course, is to deal with the representative of the Palestinian Authority in this country.  I meet  with that representative from time to time.  My constant position to him is the position that you've just  argued.  I say it time and time and time again.

The second is this.  I alluded to it at the end of my remarks before.  The other thing with this country  as a small country can do but one with a history of involvement with the United Nations from the  beginning, it is through the United Nations or beyond the United Nations to argue for an international  process which restores the centrality of what Camp David II had on offer to the current negotiating  framework.

Sooner or later we need to get back to that.  Sooner or later we need to get back to a viable proposal  on the negotiating table.  I understand, fundamentally, the reservations about the effectiveness of the  negotiators on the other side of the negotiation.  I understand that.

For when it comes to re-constituting and bringing life back into the negotiations over all, first and  foremost, we need to re-inject some momentum into it, and that, I think, is where we can play some  role effectively.

From SZC Co-opted Member, Mr Yossi Goldfarb:

Mr Rudd, you outlined the Labor Party's policy on Iraq, I guess you started to call it a plan, what if  things don't go exactly as planned.  We have already seen strong statements recently from US  President Bush and Tony Blair about Iraq.  What happens if around the United Nations and America  and regional America might decide to attack Iraq because of the empirical facts you described earlier  about the weapons of mass destruction and the fact that Hussein could use them and that he is a  mass murderer.  What would Labor policy be then?

Response: First and foremost, both the Government of the United States and the Government of the  United Kingdom are committed to a UN Security Council Resolution to this.  I visited London a few  weekends ago and met with Jack Straw, who had just returned from New York, for the  commencement of the negotiations on the UN Security Council Resolution for the restoration of the  weapons inspectors.

His view, and the subsequent view of those close to him, is that we will have a resolution through  soon and there is a strong and good prospect the Security Council will ensure the implementation of  its own resolutions.  So that is the committed policy of both the UK and the US.

Your question legitimately goes to the next set of circumstances, the next scenario, which is, of  course, one of the great "what ifs".

If you had the Australian Prime Minister in front of you at the moment and the Foreign Minister, Mr  Downer, in front of you at the moment, they would simply say "I'm not going to answer that, because it  is hypothetical".  That's their standard response.

My response is somewhat different.  My response is this.  That and I ran through it briefly in my  prepared remarks, that if it came down to that, we are looking at an alternative provision, possibly, of  the UN Charter which is called Article 51.  It deals with provisions governing anticipatory self-defence.   And if under those circumstances an argument at that stage can be mounted, which was credible,  which said that Iraq and its weapons of mass destruction represented a real and present danger to  security, then within the fabric of international law, an argument might be able to be advanced to

support a separate (beyond the UN Security Council) form of action.

We all hope in the world today, it will not get to that.  One thing to bear in mind about Saddam  Hussein, and the 20 odd years that he has been in power, is that he has a keen instinct for survival.   So I think that it is too early to leap to that third scenario, but I have given my response to it, should it  arise.

From SZC Aliya Co-Chairperson, Mr Danny Burrows

Mr Rudd, you should know that everyone in this room, on Sunday morning, when they woke up to the  tragic news felt a sense of perverse and disgusting familiarity, with the scenario that played itself out.   We all know, we have all of us been in Israel at times of tragic bombings, know that the toll initially  rises, that the faces appear the next few days on the fronts of the newspapers.  It's a scene which we  all  - everyone in this room has seen, witnessed, and sadly gone through time after time.  And it's a  very strange feeling as an Australian, living in Australia, to then see that played out in the Australian

media and the Australian society.

Is there, as a result of that feeling of empathy that we feel, is there a similar feeling from perceptions  in the wider community, perhaps within the Labor community.  I know it is very early days but since  the tragic events in Bali, there is an understanding of community need for reaction in relation to terror  bombings, particularly effecting our country's civilians and do you feel that sometimes, there is a need  to alter long-held views in relation to reaction to terrorism and violence.

Response: On the question of terrorism and violence, I just want to say this:

Not long after September 11, a resolution was put before the Australian Parliament by the Prime  Minister, which I voted for.  It committed this country to war, committed this country to war against

terrorism.  That was something that the entire Australian Labor Party voted for.  We have not  changed.  That's been our position since September 11.

October 12 adds a new regional dimension to that.  Terrorism, as I said in my remarks before,  irrespective of its national complexion, irrespective of its geographical location, irrespective of its  political objective, is unsustainable and inhuman under any of those circumstances.  Our policy on  that, our resolve on that is complete.

But, I say this, that when it comes to the debate about Iraq, it is more complex and separate.  It  involves a separate set of calculations, as far as weapons of mass destruction and the extent to which  they represent a real and present danger to the rest of the world.

On the terrorism question, I don't think there is an argument about anything that you have suggested.   Our policy and our attitude has not shifted.  What may - what the events of Bali over the last 72 hours  has done, is, I think, caused the Australian community more broadly, to conclude that September 11  was America.  Bali is here and it is us.  It is closer, it is personal and therefore, it steels the resolve of  the community to support their government, to support their parliament in eliminating terrorism,  wherever it is.

Now our responsibility, in Australia, small country, 20 million people, Gross Domestic Product smaller  than that of The Netherlands, 37,000 kilometres of coastline, on the way to Antarctica, our job here in  our argument, must focus on South East Asia.  Not exclusively, but must focus on South East Asia.   This is where we have a challenge and we must address it.

From SZC Vice President, Mr Ron Finkel

Mr Rudd, I propose the following situation to you.  You've got incontrovertible evidence of who the  perpetrator of the crime was in Bali.  You find out that he is being harboured by the Indonesian  military.  You seek his extradition from Indonesia and you get nowhere.  Your military intelligence  says that they can take him out.  Do you send in the SAS?

Response: The great thing about being the Foreign Minister is that these decisions are reserved for  the Defence Minister.
