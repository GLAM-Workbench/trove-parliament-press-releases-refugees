SHADOW TREASURER



DOORSTOP - BRISBANE  THURSDAY, 11 JULY 2013

E&OE…………………………………………………………………………………

JOE HOCKEY:

In a full hour at the National Press Club today Kevin Rudd said nothing. He said he has a  plan for meetings in Australia next week, and a plan for meetings in Papua New Guinea, but  he didn’t actually give any details on what he was going to do to make Australia better. There  was nothing there that is going to address the cost of living for everyday Australians. There  was nothing there to address his legacy of debt and deficit, which I’ll come to in a minute.

There was nothing there that is going to make life easier for small business, and there was  nothing there that is going to create more jobs for Australians. Since Kevin Rudd was first  elected, 200,000 more Australians have lost their jobs. Mr Rudd didn’t properly address that,  he simply said he is going to have meetings next week.

I suspect Kevin Rudd has been elected leader of the Labor Party but he has no policies. He  has no policy platform; all he has is a policy about Kevin Rudd. He has a stunt every day but  he has no solutions. When it comes to debt and deficit, Kevin Rudd is in denial. It is a simple  fact. It is a fact. Never let it be contradicted because it is a fact. Under the Labor Party debt  has grown faster in Australia than any other time since modern records have been kept. The  fact is that Labor said the debt would not exceed $75 billion and it has. Then they said it  wouldn’t exceed $200 billion and it has. They said it wouldn’t exceed $250 billion and it has.  Then they said it wouldn’t exceed $300 billion, and it will.

Under Kevin Rudd he’s looking for a get out of jail free card on his legacy. His legacy is  more debt, more deficits, and more than 200 000 Australians unemployed than what was the  case in 2007. On productivity - Kevin Rudd said in 2008 that he wanted a ‘productivity  revolution’. Now he says he wants a productivity group hug. This is not the way to run a  country. You actually need detailed policies. Tony Abbott and I have given Australians a  detailed policy program on productivity and many other things. For example, on productivity,  we have a six point plan, which says: Number 1, you invest in infrastructure, such as the  Gateway project here - putting a number on it, $1 billion, and similar projects in Melbourne

and Sydney. Number 2, we’re going to have cost benefit analysis on that infrastructure,  which is hugely important. Kevin Rudd never had it on the NBN, otherwise his initial $4  billion program would not have blown out to what looks like $90 billion today. We’re also  going to have a focus on getting rid of red tape and green tape. Tony Abbott announced a  deregulation program to cut $1 billion a year out of red and green tape. We also announced  we’re going to have a one stop shop for environmental approvals. Now Kevin Rudd has no  shame, he captured it and claims it as his own idea today, even though we’ve identified it as a  policy priority and have done so for an extended period of time.

We’ve also said we have a Welfare-to-Work program, which is hugely important to increase  participation. We’ve got a Paid Parental Leave program that is going to help to increase  female participation in the workforce. We’ve also said we’re not going to have more talk  about industrial relations over the next few weeks; we actually have an industrial relations  policy there that includes restating the ABCC with all its power and resources, together with  a number of other initiatives.

As you can see, we have a plan. A real plan. Kevin Rudd has lots of words, and the  Australian people soon enough will see through all the bluff and bluster, all the stunts, and  note that this is not a man who actually is in the business of governing; he’s actually only in  the business of campaigning. That’s all he’s good for.

JOURNALIST:

Mr Hockey, this national productivity pact announced today by the Prime Minister, is that  more - as you put it - a stunt?

JOE HOCKEY:

It’s all guff. It’s more Kevin Rudd rhetoric, it’s more Kevin Rudd fakeness. To have a group  hug on productivity after he first declared when he first became Prime Minister that we need  a ‘productivity revolution’. Well, in fact, he even got his figures wrong today, because  productivity growth under Labor has in no way exceeded the average under the Coalition.  Even on labour force productivity, one of the measures that he chose to use, our productivity

performance was much better than Labor’s. Quite frankly, if he can’t get the facts right, you  wouldn’t expect him to have policies that would work. He never has, and he never will.

JOURNALIST:

If he’s all bluff and bluster, would you prefer a longer election date then to sort of have more  of these stunts out there? Or do you think he’s going to go quicker?

JOE HOCKEY:

I think that if it is a shorter period to the election, it simply means the electorate is going to  see more of Kevin Rudd faster, which is pretty alarming. If it’s a longer election period,  they’re just going to see Kevin Rudd on a slower pace, but you’re still going to have a same  old Kevin Rudd, the same old promise, the same old rhetoric. Today he was given a full hour

to give a detailed plan on the economy, instead he’s trying to rewrite history. He is  encouraging everyone to have a group hug as if that’s going to actually provide a solution for  the challenges of the Australian economy.

JOURNALIST:

Do you think it damaged Tony Abbott for not turning up at the debate?

JOE HOCKEY:

Not at all. We want to see Kevin Rudd’s policies; we actually want to see what he promises  to do. There was nothing. There was just nothing there. It was an extraordinary performance.  It was an hour of a show about nothing. Let’s hope it doesn’t become a mini-series.

JOURNALIST:

Why then wasn’t Mr Abbott there to force Kevin Rudd to offer some detail on polices, rather  than allowing him a full hour to, as you put it, to talk spin?

JOE HOCKEY:

I think the key is, we want Kevin Rudd to keep talking because it just proves, yet again, he’s  got nothing to actually deliver. He came into the leadership with nothing. All he did was he  said ‘I’m Kevin, I’m here to help, I’ll rescue you’. That is not an agenda for a nation. That’s  certainly not a plan to get the economy back on track. Only the Coalition has a plan, and only  the Coalition has the determination and the resolve to deliver on a plan. Only the Coalition  can actually bring back trust to Government. On the one hand Kevin Rudd wants to forget his  history, and on the other hand he wants to rewrite it and pretend it’s all his work. Australians  will see through this.

JOURNALIST:

Mr Hockey, it’s a bad day to be a Liberal in Queensland with their multi-point plan. What we  have seen today is a bungle by the Queensland Government, how do you respond to that?

JOE HOCKEY:

They are matters for the Queensland Government. The fact is that Campbell Newman is  strong and decisive. It is a sharp contrast to that other Queenslander in Canberra.

JOURNALIST:

Do you think Kevin Rudd looked Prime Ministerial today doing that speech?

JOE HOCKEY:

I’m surprised Kevin Rudd didn’t take a photo of himself at the rostrum and then tweet it to  the nation. He is just fake. He is just fake. He is making promises that he can’t deliver, and  the fact is a few weeks out from an election, whenever this precise date is, Mr Rudd’s said

nothing. He actually said nothing. He said ‘we have some meetings next week, we will  determine the details of an agenda’. But he actually said nothing. There was not a dollar of  promise, there was not a commitment, there was not a timetable or an outcome that he was  saying. He actually said nothing for an hour.

JOURNALIST:

But if that’s your view, wouldn’t a debate be the ideal way to highlight that?

JOE HOCKEY:

I think that was highlighted perfectly today. I’d give Kevin Rudd an hour on primetime TV if  I could because people will see through him. The more he talks, the more stunts he has, the  more people will see through him.

JOURNALIST:

If Tony didn’t want to turn up today to debate him, would you have preferred that  opportunity?

JOE HOCKEY:

It’s not about the politics of debates, it’s about what you’re going to do to make the nation  stronger. What plan you actually have. What outcomes you will be measured on. I think  what’s happened is Kevin Rudd didn’t really expect to regain the leadership of the Labor  Party. Now it’s become patently clear he has no policies for the Labor Party. He’s trying to  run a change of Government agenda before the election, but the fact is he doesn’t know how  to govern, he never has, he never will. Kevin Rudd was responsible for $100 million a day of  debt. Kevin Rudd was responsible for 46,000 people coming by boat to Australia. Kevin  Rudd is responsible for the most significant and wasteful program in Australian history that  has delivered nothing, but has cost lives and has cost taxpayers more than $10 billion, and  that is the unlawful arrival of boat people. Kevin Rudd is responsible for that. He is the most  wasteful Prime Minister in Australian history, and taxpayers will continue to pay the price.

JOURNALIST:

Will you use your speech at the Queensland Media Club tomorrow as a de-facto response to  this?

JOE HOCKEY:

Yes. I’ll be covering a number of factors, but I’ll also be pointing out the fact that the  Coalition has a plan, a six point plan on productivity, we have a plan to reduce the size of  Government, we also have a plan to properly engage with Asia. Most importantly we have a

plan to get rid of the carbon tax and mining tax. Kevin Rudd is a magician, he’s not just a  clown, he’s a magician. He’s going to get rid of the carbon tax, without getting rid of the  carbon tax! He’s going to reduce electricity prices, without getting rid of either the carbon tax  or the RET scheme! That’s quite an achievement!

JOURNALIST:

Could I get a comment on jobless figures while you’re here? Queensland now has the highest  jobless rate of mainland Australia, do you think that your counterparts here in Brisbane have  had anything to do with that via public service job cuts?

JOE HOCKEY:

I’ll just say to you, Campbell Newman and the Coalition inherited the highest unemployment  rate on the mainland. They’ve had to try and fix a fiscal mess that they inherited from Labor.  You know it’s damn hard to get unemployment down when you’ve got an incompetent  Government in Canberra. As a State leader, and I’ve been there before at a State level, if  you’ve got bad Government in Canberra, it’s damn hard to address some of the structural  issues, particularly when Labor leaves a legacy of debt and deficit in your own State. Now  Queensland has been hit damn hard with the strong Australian dollar - the impact on the  tourism industry, islands closing in the Barrier Reef, infrastructure closing. They’ve been hit  very hard by coal prices coming off, commodity prices, and that’s not of the Queensland  Government’s making, but I’ll tell you what, they’ve actually got a plan to try and fix it, to  get Queensland back on the rails. I’ll tell you what there’s no better person in Queensland to  lead that charge than Campbell Newman.
