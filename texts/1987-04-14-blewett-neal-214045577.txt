HEALTH MINISTERS CONSIDER WORKFORCE SHORTAGES

Australian Health Ministers have agreed on better forward  planning to prevent shortages in the health workforces.

At their annual conference, held this year in Fremantle,  the Ministers agreed that the recent problems caused by  shortages of nurses in several States demonstrated the  need for improved planning.

Other areas of shortage singled out by the conference  included occupational therapists, physiotherapists,  psychiatrists and orthopaedic surgeons.

The Ministers agreed to continue the considerable work  undertaken by the Federal, State and Territory Governments  in the area of nursing workforce planning.

They agreed that the Commonwealth should immediately  upgrade its workforce planning function to assist in the  co-ordination of state supply and demand forecasts.

Ministers aloo agreed tliaL the commonwealth should  identify options and take appropriate action with national  and State bodies to begin rectifying identified problems.

The States and Territories agreed to supply the

Commonwealth with the necessary information in other areas  of shortage and to co-operate in the development of  planning.

The Commonwealth, States and Territories agreed to adopt  appropriate policies on education, training, and  immigration to influence the supply of health

professionals, particularly nurses.

A major development toward solving the future workforce  requirements has been the establishment by the

Commonwealth of the Inquiry into Medical Education and  Medical Workforce. The Inquiry is due to report early in  1988 and is examining a range of issues relating to the  supply of doctors in Australia.

A related issue considered by the Ministers was the need  to ensure that the special need& of ethnic communities,  especially newly arrived refugees, were catered for  through adequate arrangements for health workers of  similar ethnic background.
