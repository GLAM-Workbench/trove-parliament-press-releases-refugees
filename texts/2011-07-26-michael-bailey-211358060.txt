MICHAEL BAILEY:

Good morning to you Leader of the Opposition, Tony Abbott. How are you?

TONY ABBOTT:

I’m good, Michael, and thanks for having me.

MICHAEL BAILEY:

I know that you’re at the Mackay airport and you’re about to board a plane to Rockhampton. You’re going  to be very busy when you actually land in Rockhampton, aren’t you?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well look, I want to reassure the cattle producers of central Queensland that the Opposition takes them  seriously. We know they’ve been through a very rough time with the suspension of the live cattle trade to  Indonesia having knock-on effects for the cattle industry right around Australia. This is an extraordinary  example of incompetence by government, a government that panicked in the face of a TV programme and,  in so doing, has jeopardised a very important part of the economy in northern Australia. The Coalition wants  to show solidarity with the cattle industry at this very difficult time.

The other thing I want to do is reassure everyone involved in agriculture that we will do our damndest to  protect them from the carbon tax which, as you know, Michael, is going to hit agriculture. Sure, the  Government says that agriculture will be formally exempt, at least for the first few years, but every  agricultural property uses power and every agricultural producer depends critically upon transport and  power and transport will be at heart of the carbon tax.

MICHAEL BAILEY:

Well, I’ve got to tell you the price of beef has actually dropped because I know for a fact that we’ve got two  of Australia’s largest meat workers in town. One’s at capacity. I think they kill about 800 a day and the other  one’s 1,700 and they are actually only working three days a week, so it really is affecting everybody’s back  pocket which is really strange. When are we actually going to fix up this live export? I mean, is it starting to  turn around or is it still in negotiation mode?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, my understanding, Michael, is that the Government now accepts that it made a terrible, terrible  mistake and it says that it’s prepared to reissue licences but the trouble is once this trade has been  interrupted, it’s very, very hard to start up again and the Indonesians are now very, very unhappy about the  way they feel they’ve been treated by the Australian Government. They think that the Australian  Government has effectively declared that Indonesia can’t be trusted to treat animals properly and we know  that the footage that was so appalling was from just one place and on the basis of one terrible bit of footage  we’ve damned the whole of the Indonesian industry and the Indonesians understandably think that this is yet  another gratuitous insult from Australia to Indonesia and the consequence of it is that the livelihoods of tens  of thousands of people in tropical Australia have been put at risk.

MICHAEL BAILEY:

Look, I just want to touch very briefly on immigration, of course, the boat people.  It looks like another, you  know, 500 people on the way over. I can’t quite comprehend what we’re doing here because by the sounds  of it once the 800 people have been deported to Malaysia the boat people are just going to crank it up again,  as far as I can see it, because we stop at 800 yet we’re taking in 4,000 refugees from Malaysia’s 90,000  waiting list and that’s fair enough but at the end of the day when we ship the people over to Malaysia we’re  going to be paying for their education and job benefits for how long until they actually find another country  to and that could take up to 20 years?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, you’re absolutely right. I mean, this is a dud deal whichever way you look at it. Three points about it:  first of all it’s a stunning admission of failure by the Government, an absolute confession of defeat because  for years the Government was saying that the boat people were coming because of push factors and now  they’re admitting that it was pull factors all along. Second, it’s a broken promise. The Prime Minister was in  full sanctimony mode declaring not so long ago that she would never send boat people to a country that  hadn’t signed the UN Convention on Refugees…

MICHAEL BAILEY:

And they still haven’t.

TONY ABBOTT:

…Malaysia hasn’t signed it and won’t sign it and yet boat people are going there. So it’s yet another broken  promise from a completely untrustworthy Prime Minister. The final point, Michael, is that I don’t think it  will work because since the deal has been announced we’ve had 11 boats, 557 illegal arrivals and if  announcing the deal didn’t stop the boats, signing a bit of paper’s not going to stop the boats and I think that  this is an extraordinarily bad bit of policy from a government which has the Midas Touch in reverse.

MICHAEL BAILEY:

Well you know it would seem to me that the people who are going to jump on the boats are going to go, well  if we do get transferred to Malaysia they’re going to pay our education and food so we’re better, as almost a

two-tier society in the asylum waiting queue overseas. I shake my head with disbelief that we export 800  and take in 4,000 but I suppose that’s another day for another story.

Look Tony, small business, they are really feeling the crunch out there in the heartlands. I walk down East  Street, I go along Yeppoon, I go to Emu Park and all I hear is: taxes, taxes and more taxes, when is it going  to stop? I mean, you know, it’s crippling small businesses. Are you standing up for small business?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I certainly intend to and unfortunately, Michael, it will only stop when this government goes. I mean,  the best thing we could do for consumer confidence in Australia right now is get rid of the Government. I  think that confidence would pick up the instant an election was called and confidence would skyrocket the  instant this government was gone and that’s because people understand that this government is addicted to  taxes - whether it’s the mining tax, the carbon tax, the flood tax, all the other taxes that they want to increase  like the alcopops tax and the additional tax on private health insurance and so on…

MICHAEL BAILEY:

Hang on a second. Look, I’ve just got this email, Australia’s $2 billion a year cement industry and it’s 1,800  direct jobs are in the firing line under Labor’s carbon tax and new shipping rules our Gillard Government is  proposing to introduce. Now, what’s all that about?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I went to a big cement works in Gladstone a couple of months ago and you just can’t make cement  without using massive quantities of energy. So, cement is intensely carbon intensive and there’s just no way  around it. There is no way of making cement without lots and lots of emissions. There’s no way of making  steel or aluminium or zinc and nickel without lots and lots of emissions. So, what this carbon tax is going to  do to these industries is drive them offshore because we’re not going to use less steel and glass and cement  and all the rest of it, we’re just going to use more imported stuff and that’s, I suppose, the counterproductive  nature of this tax. In the end, it’s not going to help the environment because it will just drive jobs and  emissions offshore and that’s what the cement industry is alluding to.

MICHAEL BAILEY:

Yeah well right now it costs about the same to ship cement from China to Australia as it does to ship it from  Adelaide to Port Kembla. It just doesn’t seem right, does it? The wages are just, you know, out of control.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I’m all in favour of high wages because I think that the workers of Australia deserve to be well  rewarded for a good job but what you don’t want to do is make industries uncompetitive and that’s what this  carbon tax will do. Given all the other problems that Australian industry faces - the high dollar, the small  market, the higher wages - and, as I said, I’m in favour of higher wages, not against them but if you are  going to pay people good wages, you’ve got to do your damndest to maximise the competitiveness of  industry and hitting it with a carbon tax is going to make it much, much harder for these industries that were  already under a lot of competitive pressures to survive.

MICHAEL BAILEY:

Now, look, at the end of the day the carbon tax, is it just a furphy? I mean, I want to hear it from your lips.  You know, is it a furphy? Is it just another way to get us out of the red and into the black?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, that’s a good question. I think there are a lot of Australians who think this is all about revenue, not  about the environment and I think, frankly, this government is proposing a form of socialism which is  masquerading as environmentalism. If you are serious about reducing emissions, and I am, you should take  direct action to reduce them and that’s what the Coalition’s policy does. We will actually go to the market  via a tender process to get the best possible proposals to reduce emissions. That’s what we will do. What the  Government is going to do is just make everything more expensive and collect for itself a huge pot of money  and it’s interesting that when Iceland was in financial trouble, the IMF instructed them to increase the  carbon tax and when Greece was in financial trouble, they started selling more carbon credits. So, at the end  of the day, once the Government has got this additional financial vehicle at its disposal, it will use it for  revenue-raising. That’s just the way governments inevitably are and that’s why we shouldn’t have this tax.  It’s a toxic tax. The Government has no mandate. It’s a bad tax based on a lie and I keep saying on my tour  around the country, Michael, that there should be no tax collection without an election.

MICHAEL BAILEY:

What’s going to be the trigger, because at the end of the day if everyone stays to their belief, this tax will go  through, no ifs or buts about that, I mean, unless someone actually changes their mind, say it goes through  and they start collecting up to $9 billion a year, you take over in two years time, are you actually going to  reverse that? I mean, that’s a lot of money coming through for the Government to spend, regardless of  whether it’s Labor or Liberal or, dare I say it, the Greens.

TONY ABBOTT:

Michael, the short answer is yes, of course we will rescind it. We won’t roll it back, we won’t adjust it, we  will just abolish it because it’s a bad tax. Now, I want to say this to your listeners: please don’t assume that  this tax is already a done deal. The Labor Party is very divided over this. There are a lot of people in the  caucus who think this isn’t their tax, this is the Greens’ tax which Bob Brown has foisted upon a weak Prime  Minister.

Now, the local member in Rockhampton, Kirsten Livermore, represents a seat which is going to be very  badly impacted by the carbon tax. The mining industry is probably going to be impacted more than just  about any other industry and we all know that mining is central to the prosperity of the Bowen Basin and  central Queensland more generally so what I’d say to your listeners is, please, don’t just be passive in the  face of this threat to your cost of living, this threat to your prosperity. Make contact with your local member.  Send her an email. Ring up her office and if you see her in the street, politely say ‘look Kirsten, why are you  doing this to us? Why did the Prime Minister say to us before the election there will be no carbon tax, never  ever, but  why is she now trying to sneak it through a parliament that has no mandate?’ Because in the end in  a democracy, Michael, the people are sovereign and the local member for Capricornia needs to hear what the  people of Capricornia think and decide who she’s representing. Does she represent them or does she  represent this floundering Prime Minister and her toxic tax?

MICHAEL BAILEY:

Well, I’ve got to say. I know what her answer is going to be. Just look in her own backyard because there is  so much investment still continuing to happen in the coal fields. Are we getting mixed messages? I mean,  the boss of coal, [inaudible] came into town and said look, we are making lots of money in our own  backyard when it comes to coal but future investment in ten years time will dry out because of the carbon  tax. Is that the way you see it?

TONY ABBOTT:

Exactly right. Look, if the Chinese were to do in their country what Australia is proposing to do in ours, coal  would have next to no future because on the Government’s own figures, power generation from coal -

absent from carbon capture and storage - is going to drop from 80 per cent now to ten per cent by 2050.  Now, this is very, very bad news for the coal industry and, lets face it, if a carbon tax doesn’t reduce the use  of coal, it’s not going to do its job.

MICHAEL BAILEY:

Yeah, look, when it comes to coal, I see the carbon tax in India is one dollar seven a tonne.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I’m not sure about that that’s a carbon tax as such, it’s just a tax and look, we are starting off at $23 a  tonne. Even on the Government’s own figures it will be $29 a tonne by 2020 and it will be $131 a tonne and  that’s in today’s dollars, $131 a tonne by 2050. So, this tax is just going to go up and up and up and Michael,  this is terrible news for every Australian’s cost of living and it’s disastrous for the coal industry because it  basically says, look, coal is not the foundation of a modern economy. Coal is a substance that is killing the  planet and that’s why this carbon tax ultimately spells the death of coal.

MICHAEL BAILEY:

And I believe that graziers at Paradise Lagoons in Gracemere this morning are looking forward to having a  chat with you and hearing your thoughts from 10:30 until 12 and then you will be moving along to a sausage  sizzle. How many sausages have you eaten in this campaign?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, look, I’m wearing out the shoe leather, Michael, but you know, it’s interesting, the Prime Minister  seems to have given up on her shoe leather campaign. She was in Canberra for the Press Club on Thursday.  She went to Tasmania on the weekend but that was for forestry. She was in Canberra for this dodgy deal on  boat people yesterday. I think the Prime Minister has decided that the more she talks about the carbon tax,  the less people like it. So, I think we can say that the Prime Minister has officially surrendered in her  campaign to sell the carbon tax.

MICHAEL BAILEY:

Ok, well, you’ll be talking to the masses at the Rockhampton Showgrounds from 12:30 until 1:30 at the  James Lawrence Pavilion. Let’s end this on a high note. You love you know, peddling around this great land  of ours. You must have been so excited with the Tour de France?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, yes I was, Michael. It was an extraordinary victory for Cadel Evans.

MICHAEL BAILEY:

Yeah, Cadel, wasn’t he just brilliant? His acceptance speech was just wonderful.

TONY ABBOTT:

He has stamped himself as one of the all time great Australian sportsmen and perhaps the toughest man ever  to represent his country or to ride for his country because what an amazing feat. This is just an extraordinary  endurance event.

MICHAEL BAILEY:

I think he’s come first, he’s come third, but he just never gave up, did he?

TONY ABBOTT:

He never did, he never did.

MICHAEL BAILEY:

Never gave up.

TONY ABBOTT:

And last year, he was looking so promising and he just had a nasty injury but rather than feel sorry for  himself he just buckled down and got back on his bike.

MICHAEL BAILEY:

I was almost, my face just went, oh, you know, when the bike started wobbling, he had to jump off and get a  new one but he just kept powering on and bicycle sales look like they’ve increased 50 per cent overnight.  The kids are saying, well, if he can do it, we can do it. Good luck to them, I reckon.

TONY ABBOTT:

They’ve got to not just buy the bike, they’ve got to ride the bike!

MICHAEL BAILEY:

Yeah, and look, welcome to central Queensland. It’s good to see you are in the heartland of the coal fields.

TONY ABBOTT:

Thank you so much, Michael.

MICHAEL BAILEY:

That’s Tony Abbott, doing his stuff and not giving up on wearing out the shoe leather and spreading the  word about the tax. Make up your own mind. Obviously, it’s going to be a long, hard battle.
