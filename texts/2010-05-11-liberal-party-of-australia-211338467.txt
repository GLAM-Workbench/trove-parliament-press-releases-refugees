INTERVIEW WITH MARK RILEY - CHANNEL 7 LATE NEWS - TUESDAY 11 MAY, 2010

Subject: Budget 2010

MARK RILEY:

Joe Hockey, thanks for joining us.

JOE HOCKEY:

My pleasure.

MARK RILEY:

The government described this Budget as fiscally conservative and responsible.  What words would  you use?

JOE HOCKEY:

A shameless con.  The government is banking their claim on the next mining boom, but they’re  imposing a $9 billion a year tax on the industry.

They’ll never deliver a surplus Budget.  They never have, they never will.

MARK RILEY:

So when will we see your alternative plans and policies?

JOE HOCKEY:

Certainly before the next election.

MARK RILEY:

How long before the next election?

JOE HOCKEY:

You never know how quickly it might come, Mark.  But I’ll tell you this, we will not be making  promises we can’t deliver.  Tonight, shamelessly they made an announcement about new  GP super clinics.  They haven’t even delivered three of the 30 they’ve previously promised.

Today they had to commit a billion dollars to deal with their asylum seeker failed border  protection issue and a billion dollars to address their pink batt failures.

Kevin Rudd said there would be no more health bureaucrats under his plan.  Tonight he  allocated $500 million to a whole new health bureaucracy.

MARK RILEY:

Well Wayne Swan said if you block the mining tax then workers will miss out on the super guarantee  increase and small business won’t get the tax cuts.

JOE HOCKEY:

You see, that’s the fraud that they’re going on with.  The three percent increase in superannuation  either comes out of employers’ payrolls or it comes out of the after-tax, take-home pay of the  employees.  Not a dollar is coming from the Federal government on that three percent increase in  superannuation.  This just an example of the spin of the Rudd government.

MARK RILEY:

We’ll be waiting for your alternative.  Mr Hockey, thanks for joining us.

JOE HOCKEY:

My pleasure.
