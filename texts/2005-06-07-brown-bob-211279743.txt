Chen Yonglin: new asylum bid

7th Jun 2005

Chinese diplomat defector Chen Yonglin has sought political asylum in  Australia again. Yesterday, a letter was sent to the Minister for Foreign  Affairs, Alexander Downer seeking asylum. A copy of this letter went  to Prime Minister Howard. This approach removes the doubt raised by

the Government that his original letter, on May 26, sought political  asylum.

Greens Senator Bob Brown, who arranged legal advice for Mr Chen,  says that the Chinese Ambassador, Madam Fu, is an impressive  representative of a communist police state.



“According to the US State Department, Beijing uses arbitrary arrest,  torture and forced ‘re-education’ for dissenters. More than 250,000  people are in ‘re-education camps’. Thousands of people have been  arrested for adherence to the Falun Gong religion and reports say that  up to 2000 people have died. Last year China executed more people  than all other countries combined. Madam Fu should clarify these

damning reports of the Beijing dictatorship’s methods,” said Senator  Brown.

Senator Brown says that a Senate inquiry is likely to be set up next  week to investigate the Government’s failure to give Mr Chen, his wife  and daughter, immediate asylum and protection when first approached  on May 26.

Senator Brown is approaching Mr Downer’s office for a full briefing on  the affair.
