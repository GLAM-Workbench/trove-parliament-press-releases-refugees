20 August 2011

TRANSCRIPT OF THE HON. TONY ABBOTT MHR   DOORSTOP INTERVIEW,    ADELAIDE



Subjects: Death of New Zealand SAS soldier in Afghanistan; Craig Thomson; border protection; Julia  Gillard’s carbon tax.



E&OE……………………….……………………………………………………………

TONY ABBOTT:

There’s been another death in action in Afghanistan. Not an Australian soldier, but one of our trans-Tasman  brothers: a New Zealand SAS soldier who died heroically trying to rescue hostages in Kabul and I just want  to say on behalf of the Coalition our thoughts and prayers go out to the people of New Zealand at this  moment and I’m sure the thoughts and prayers of every Australian are with our friends in New Zealand at  this sad time.

QUESTION:

Further to the Craig Thomson story, Barry O’Farrell has called for him to be sacked. Do you share in that? Is  Mr O’Farrell saying something that perhaps is putting the cart before the horse?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, I think that first and foremost the Prime Minister has got to answer some questions. She can’t run  away from this issue the way she has run away from the public and run away from the parliament over the  last few days. What we’ve got at the moment is a member of parliament in protection and a Prime Minister  in hiding and that’s just not good enough. You can’t have a Prime Minister who can’t go about her ordinary  public duties because she’s frightened of taking questions about one of her MPs. So, this matter does have to  be resolved. It’s got to be resolved quickly and I call on the Prime Minister to do that because, as things  stand, every day there’s more and more unsavoury information coming out and every day it makes it more  difficult for the Prime Minister and the Government to function.

QUESTION:

Should he resign?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, that’s up to the Prime Minister and it’s up to him and his conscience. Obviously, something untoward  has gone on here. He has to explain it. The Prime Minister has to explain it and then the Prime Minister has  to deal with it. But every day that this matter drags on makes it harder for the Prime Minister and the  Government to go about their ordinary business. You can’t have a situation where the Prime Minister of this  country is running away from the public and, in particular, from the media and the parliament because she  doesn’t want to answer questions on this matter.

QUESTION:

Should she be telling him to step down at this point?

TONY ABBOTT:

That’s a matter for her. She has to deal with it. It’s her Government; he’s her member. She appointed him,  effectively, to chair an important parliamentary committee. This is her responsibility and she must deal with  it, but the point I make is that we can’t have a Government which is paralysed because the Prime Minister  doesn’t want to go out and face the public, doesn’t want to go out and face the media because she doesn’t  want to face questions about a particular Member of Parliament.

QUESTION:Ã¢ÂÂ¨Ã¢ÂÂ¨

Hasn’t she, in effect, dealt with it by saying that she supports him and if you’re not prepared to say that he  should resign, what more should she be doing?

TONY ABBOTT:Ã¢ÂÂ¨

She should be facing up to the Australian people. She should be answering questions about what really has  gone on. What did the ALP know? How much did the ALP pay? What did the Prime Minister know? What  did the Prime Minister or her office do in connection with the Labor Party’s dealings with this man?  Now…Ã¢ÂÂ¨Ã¢ÂÂ¨

QUESTION:Ã¢ÂÂ¨Ã¢ÂÂ¨

Do you think Craig himself needs to come clean?

TONY ABBOTT:Ã¢ÂÂ¨Ã¢ÂÂ¨

They both do. They both do. I mean, he needs to explain exactly what has happened. She needs to explain  exactly what she’s done. She needs to deal with this problem because, as things stand, you’ve got an MP in  protection and a Prime Minister in hiding because the MP won’t answer questions and the Prime Minister  won’t answer questions and you can’t have the Government continue under these circumstances.Ã¢ÂÂ¨Ã¢ÂÂ¨

QUESTION:Ã¢ÂÂ¨Ã¢ÂÂ¨

Mr Abbott, on a state-based matter, Isobel Redmond, from what we understand is, it’ll be a bit of a policy  vacuum here today, but the Liberal Party will be looking at what was effectively a blunder at the last state  election in not targeting marginal seats. Have you any advice for her? Do you think it was a winnable  election that they let off the hook?

TONY ABBOTT:Ã¢ÂÂ¨Ã¢ÂÂ¨

Look, I’m just not going to rake over old coals. All of us learn lessons from elections. I learnt some

important lessons from the 2010 election, that’s just the way things are. We all learn from all of our  experiences, good and bad.Ã¢ÂÂ¨Ã¢ÂÂ¨

QUESTION:Ã¢ÂÂ¨Ã¢ÂÂ¨

But for instance, state Labor here was accused of dirty tricks with bogus how-to-vote cards, etc. There have  been some derogatory things said about the state Labor Party here by the state president here, by yourself.  Do the Liberals state-wide need to get down and dirty more than they have in the past?

TONY ABBOTT:Ã¢ÂÂ¨Ã¢ÂÂ¨

No, look, it’s important that the Coalition practise politics in a way which is firm but fair. I think that there  do have to be some standards in this business and the important thing for us at a state and federal level is to  appropriately hold the Government to account and to intelligently articulate credible alternative policies.  Now, that’s what I’ve tried to do as federal leader and I know that’s what Isobel has tried to do as state  leader.Ã¢ÂÂ¨Ã¢ÂÂ¨

QUESTION:Ã¢ÂÂ¨Ã¢ÂÂ¨

The party president said this morning said that the Liberal Party shouldn’t operate on Labor or the media’s  timetable for releasing policies. You spoke there about articulating policies. At what stage is it appropriate  for an Opposition to start spelling out what they’d do as a Government?

TONY ABBOTT:Ã¢ÂÂ¨Ã¢ÂÂ¨

In good time before an election. Now, if the next federal election takes place at the scheduled time, that’s  about two years away. If the next state election takes place at the scheduled time, that’s about two and a half  years away, and in good time before elections is when oppositions should put out their policies.

QUESTION:

I just had a quick question about Manus Island. Why are you calling for a costing if the deal hasn’t been  done yet?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well look, this is yet another Labor announcement. This is a Government which is big on announcements  but short on delivery. This is a Government which is very good at generating a headline, but very bad at  making a difference and what we see today is yet another announcement but there are no dates, no details,  no dollars. I’ll believe it when I see it and if the Prime Minister were serious about sorting out the boat  people problem, she wouldn’t just pick and choose amongst policies of the former Howard Government she  would put the whole lot of them back in place and that means Nauru, Manus, temporary protection visas and  a willingness to turn boats around where it’s safe to do so.

QUESTION:

Another boat came in last night. What does that say about the PNG deal and Malaysia?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, I think the Malaysian deal is increasingly tenuous. We’ve now had five boats and more than 300  people since the deal was signed. I think it’s now something like 12 boats and, I think, 800 people since the  deal was announced. So, plainly this deal is not stopping the boats. She’s desperate to find more. She’s

desperate to make more announcements, but what we know from this Prime Minister is that she’s very good  at making announcements but hopeless at delivery.

QUESTION:

You were speaking about the carbon tax. What sort of impacts will that have here in South Australia  [inaudible]?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, over time, the carbon tax poses a terrible threat to the heavy industry of South Australia. It was Wayne  Hanson, the South Australian Secretary of the Australian Workers’ Union, who first said - and I think  rightly said - that Port Pirie and Whyalla would become wastelands if the carbon tax went ahead. Now, this  week in the federal parliament we had Simon Crean saying that ‘oh, it’s ok, there’s going to be a green  energy grid’. Well, that’s great. But a green energy grid doesn’t substitute for a steel mill. A green energy  grid doesn’t substitute for the 5,000 jobs in Whyalla that are directly or indirectly dependent upon OneSteel.
