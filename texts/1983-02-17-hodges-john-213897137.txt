An audio-visual series called "Neighbourhood Living", aimed at

helping migrants and refugees settle into the community, was

launched in Brisbane today by the Minister for Immigration and

Ethnic Affairs, John Hodges.

The launching was held at the Migrant Resource Centre, 149^Melbourne

Street, South Brisbane.

The series will give new arrivals information about living in

suburban Australia. The series, produced ~on~videotape-by—F 11m—   _

Australia, covers topics such as "garbage do's and don'ts", renting,

tenancy pitfalls, immunization programs and community services.

The tapes will be available in seven community languages - Vietnamese,

Khmer- , Lao, Cantonese, Polish, Spanish and Arabic -< and written

material will be available for viewers to take away after they have

seen the tapes.

Migrant Resource Centres, migrant centres and regional offices of

the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs will have copies

of the videotapes, to be shown or lent to migrants and refugees.

Mr. Hodges said the series grew out of the Fairfield CounciÃÂ’^ ^ & ÃÂ & ÃÂ» ÃÂ¹

at the lack of knowledge in the community about the role played by

local government and the services it offered.

"The people in this series are not professional actors and.

actresses, but ordinary people, residents of the Fairfield area',Ã¢ÂÂ¢

Mr. Bodges said.

Â®A bonus in making the series has been the positive contribution

it has, Bade to fostering harmony in the community. Film Australia

reported--almost overwhelming co-operation from the people of Fairfield.

*1 believe that the "Neighbourhood Living" series is a significant

addition to a broad range of services available to new settlers

through the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, and

through:: state and local governments. ""
