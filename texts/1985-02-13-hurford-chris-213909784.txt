HURFORD MEETS UN SECRETARY-GENERAL

Federal Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Chris  Hurford, met today with the UN Secretary-General, Mr. Perez de  Cuellar, to discuss regional and other matters related to  Australia's refugee and humanitarian interests.

In outlining Australia's long history of migration, Mr. Hurford  noted the increasing demands made for entry to Australia both of  a permanent and temporary nature.

Mr. Hurford referred to the Government's continuing willingness  to play its part in helping people subjected to human rights  difficulties."The Labor Government has given practical effect to  this commitment through the operation of refugee and  humanitarian programs in almost every continent of the world",  Mr. Hurford said.

In this context Mr. Hurford expressed Australia's support for  the work of the Secretary-General and the UN system,  particularly that of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.

Mr. Hurford took the opportunity to obtain the Secretary-General's assessment of refugee problems in the region  following his recent visit to ASEAN and Indochinese countries.

Mr. Hurford reaffirmed the Government's commitment to work  towards the resolution of these problems, particularly by  supporting UN efforts to achieve local solutions.

In the course of the discussions, the Secretary-General welcomed  Australia's refugee and humanitarian programs and Australian  support for the UN in its efforts to assist refugees and  displaced persons.
