VIETNAMESE' REFUGEES

The Australian Government has decided to initiate . a special longitudinal survey of Vietnamese refugees who had  recently settled in Australia, the Prime Minister, Mr Whitlam  announced tonight.

The study will be carried out by Dr Jean Martin of  the Australian National University. Dr Martin and her associates  will interview the refugees at regular intervals over a period  of about five years.

The survey would concentrate on those who had neither  relatives nor friends here. It would record fully their experiences  in making new lives in Australia. .  Ã¢ÂÂ

Ã¢ÂÂ   Mr whitlam said that if there had been Government  follow-up studies of earlier refugee groups who had made their -   homes in Australia, the task of selecting refugees now would be  easier. .  .  '

as

Mr Whitlam said the study would encompass such things

. The refugees' reasons for leaving their own country;

.  Their social characteristics?

.  Their aspirations in their new homeland;

. What Australian Government assistance in maintenance and  welfare they requGested, or needed, and received;

. The problems they thought they might have to face in settling  in Australia,.and how these compared with the problems .   actually encountered;

. The problems of culture and language difference they had to  face, and what happened to their cultural identity in the  process of re-settlement; and

. To what extent - if at all - they suffered from racism.

Other factors which would emerge from the study  would be employment patterns, the use made of qualifications  and skills possessed by the refugees, their success in becoming  integrated, and the time they took to become indistinguishable

from the rest of the Australian community in their requirements  of the Australian Government.

"This is the first time that Australia - without  regard to racial origins - has offered resettlement opportunities  to people displaced in Asia who had no identifiable connection  with this country," Mr Whitlam said. Ã¢ÂÂ

"In living up to her responsibilities in the  international community, Australia accepted those considered  most in need of humanitarian assistance and who were unlikely  to be offered resettlement opportunities elsewhere."
