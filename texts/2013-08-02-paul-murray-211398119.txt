PAUL MURRAY:

Mr Abbott, good morning.

TONY ABBOTT:

Good morning Paul.

PAUL MURRAY:

First thing’s first. Are you willing to call if you become Prime Minister a royal commission into the third umpire system in the UK

with the Ashes. Fair dinkum, what is going on with the umpiring in the cricket?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well look, you know we love umpires when the decisions go our way and we hate them when they don’t and yes it’s got to be far,  but I suspect that there’ll always be controversy about cricketing decisions mate.

PAUL MURRAY:

Fair call. Now, I want to talk about the bank tax here. The suggestion being made by the Government is that this is really only

going to affect banks when they sit on large deposits for a couple of days, so in the way that it takes four days for a cheque to  clear or two days for a huge amount of money to go from one institution to another. What do you believe in reality the tax will be?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well essentially Paul, this is a Government which is desperate for cash. It’s raiding everyone’s hip pocket because it can’t control

its own spending and my point is if they hit you with new taxes before an election, imagine what they’ll be like after an election,  because it’s a Government which is addicted to spending and if you are addicted to spending, ultimately you’ve got to be addicted

to taxes too, because somehow or other, it’s all got to be paid for. Spending today is going to be paid for by taxes tomorrow and  that’s just the iron law of Government finances.

PAUL MURRAY:

What’s amazing too, I was just trying to think about it this morning is that under this Government with both of its prime ministers or

times three when you’re talking about the variables of prime ministers. There has been two increases in the Medicare levy, there’s  been the carbon tax, there’s been the mining tax. There’s now the cigarette tax, there’s now the bank tax. It is pretty extraordinary

for a Government to frankly come up with as well meaning in some cases, as bipartisan in others, but basically to have come up  with that many taxes in just six years.

TONY ABBOTT:

And Paul, there are more that you didn’t mention. There’s the alcopops tax, there are the extra taxes on superannuation. I mean

the Government’s claim the other day that they’d legislate to stop them raiding your super for five years was a demonstration that  they fear the public’s reaction to their superannuation cash grab, just a couple of months ago. Look, no-one’s savings are safe

from this Government, because when the Government needs money, the easiest thing in the world to do is to run these stealth

taxes that they think people might notice. Well, people do notice it and in the end the only way you can be relatively secure  against a smash and grab raid by the government is if you know the government respects your money and is frugal with spending

that is funded by taxpayers.

PAUL MURRAY:

Now, what about the smoking tax? Look, it is indefensible obviously to mount any argument against making people give up  cigarettes and that is not what this is about but I do question the sanctimony and some of the motivation that is around it. Kevin

Rudd wants to pretend that is about getting people healthy, the by-product of getting people healthy is that they get to put an  awful lot of money into the forward estimates in the Budget. Would you agree with me that put simply if this was seriously about

stopping people smoking then every cent of that money becomes quarantined for dealing with the problems that arise as a result  of smoking and helping people get off smoking not consolidated revenue to later go off and buy off places like PNG.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I think that is a fair point Paul. It would be much easier to defend this as a health measure if all the money was then directed

into some kind of smoking prevention programme but plainly that is not what it is all about. It is basically just another revenue  measure masquerading as a health measure. The fact that they are expecting to raise some $5 billion from the smoking tax, the

cigarettes tax demonstrates they expect people to keep smoking. Sure, over time there will be a marginal reduction in the number  of smokers as the price of cigarettes goes up but this is a revenue measure not a health measure.

PAUL MURRAY:

Yesterday it was revealed by Nick Xenophon that this Government is going to put $30 million aside or has put $30 million aside for

those ads that are running everywhere specifically on the boat people issue and the Papua New Guinea solution. When we spoke  in Canberra we spoke about the toxicity that is government funded advertising. You know my view that I thought it was, the

previous government under John Howard that also got it wrong but this is out of control, $30 million and it is just for one of  however many campaigns that are out there. You can’t go to the movies, you can’t go online, you can’t listen to the radio without

being hit over the head with some sort of taxpayer propaganda.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, Paul again I think you are expressing the sentiment of millions of Australians because this isn’t aimed at the boat people as  Nick Xenophon rather wittily put it this is aimed at the vote people - the vote people not boat people. There is up to $30 million to

be spent on advertising in Australia and last time I looked most of the people smugglers at least, sure there is Captain Emad and  a few others maybe that have managed to get into this country but most of the people smugglers were based in Indonesia. There

is a zero budget as I understand it for advertising in Indonesia and elsewhere there’s $30 million which is basically to fund  government political propaganda. The Labor Party should do it. The other thing we shouldn’t forget Paul, is that Kevin Rudd

called  government funded political advertising a cancer on our democracy. That’s what he said about it before the last election.  He could hardly have been more extreme in the language he used. He said that the only government funded advertising that

should happen within six months of an election campaign ought to be approved by the Leader of the Opposition to ensure that it is  not in any way political, well, yet another one of Kevin Rudd’s worthless commitments. Yet another one of Kevin Rudd’s solemn

pledges that gets junked as soon as it suits his political convenience to do so.

PAUL MURRAY:

Are you ready if the election was called this weekend? I know that the professional observers of politics are trying to make it seem  like you’re somehow spooked by Kevin Rudd but are you ready to go?

TONY ABBOTT:

The short answer is yes Paul and I think the whole country is ready for an election. I think we’re overdue for an election. I think the

country would’ve like to have had an election back in the first half of 2011 when Julia Gillard broke her pledge that there would be  no carbon tax under the government I lead and let’s not forget that Kevin Rudd was Foreign Minister then and at every step of the

way, Kevin Rudd voted for all of the measures which he now admits the government got wrong.

PAUL MURRAY:

But how do you feel about this nonsense that seems to be seeping into political commentary that somehow you’re wobbling  because Kevin Rudd’s back? I don’t see it but what do you think when you read that stuff?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I think there are a lot of political commentators who would like that to be true but it isn’t true. We always expected that Kevin  Rudd would come back if Julia Gillard’s popularity remained in the pits. We always knew that it was going to be tough to win an

election from opposition. I’ve likened it to climbing Mount Everest, it was going to be like climbing Mount Everest whether Julia  Gillard or Kevin Rudd was Prime Minister but the interesting thing Paul is despite the change at the top, it’s the same bad

government, it’s the same rotten to the heart Labor Party and since Mr Rudd became Prime Minister, we’ve got two new taxes  and about 1,600 illegal boat arrivals. So nothing of any substance has changed.

What we’ve got is fake change from the great pretender of Australian politics.

PAUL MURRAY:

Tony Abbott, nice to talk to you. All the best and if the election is called in this weekend, we look forward to having you in the  studio between now and the election.

TONY ABBOTT:

Thank you so much, Paul.
