Subjects: Commonwealth Games overstayers; Labor Party border protection policy.

EO&E...........................................................................................................................................



PETER DUTTON:

Firstly; as was detailed in Senate Estimates yesterday, there are a number of people that  have overstayed their visa conditions that were here to either compete in the  Commonwealth Games or were here as officials or part of the media entourage from  particular countries.

The Australian Border Force, as we announced last week, will continue their enforcement  action. If anybody has any information in relation to these individuals then we would be  very grateful for that information and a number of people - 190 as I’m advised is the latest  figure - have applied for Protection visas. So they will go onto Bridging visas, which  “normalises” their arrangements and their applications will be considered.

The second thing that I wanted to speak about this morning is what is an unravelling policy  in the Labor Party. Ged Kearney yesterday really belled the cat.

Now, it’s clear that Kevin Rudd nor Julia Gillard could ever contain the Left of the Labor  Party and when they were in government they trashed the border protection policy. So it’s  clear now that a majority of the Labor caucus is against stopping the boats.

Ged Kearney has no answer for what happens when women and children start drowning at  sea again or what happens when people go into detention until their identities can be  established, what happens when these people can't get travel documents from a country  like Iran and return back to their country of origin.

The Labor Party, once again - and we've watched this movie before - they have completely  and utterly capitulated on border protection policy.

Bill Shorten is making the same mistakes that Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard did in relation to  border protection and their policy is unravelling to a point where I can tell you; if Labor wins  the upcoming election, the biggest election party will be in some village where people  smugglers are toasting prime minister Bill Shorten because it will mean the boats restart.

That is something that Bill Shorten needs to address. He will stitch together some dodgy  deal at Conference like he did last time with a bloc of votes from the CFMEU or other unions  because of some side deal, but people know, as they saw with Julia Gillard and Kevin Rudd,  the Labor Party cannot hold their policy together when it comes to border protection.

QUESTION:



Minister, with the Commonwealth Games, the missing athletes, as you understand it, is it  about 50 that are unaccounted for?

PETER DUTTON:

That's the case, yes.

QUESTION:



Are you actively looking for those athletes?

PETER DUTTON:

Yes, they are.

QUESTION:

Or are you hoping…

PETER DUTTON:

…no, no, there's an operation that's being conducted by the Department at the moment and  that will be in conjunction of course with the state policing agencies etc. to try and find  leads in relation to these people and to take them into immigration detention and  eventually to deport them.

QUESTION:



Minister, you did say last week that after these big events we expect some people to stick  around and try to claim asylum. Did we expect the number to be this high?

PETER DUTTON:

I don't want to see it at one, let alone 255, so obviously though we were criticised at the  time for taking too long to issue the documents. You'll remember I think Peter Beattie  criticising the Government at the time, or my Department for taking too long because we  were scrutinising the number of applications. Obviously all the health and security and  integrity checks were conducted - there was no compromise in relation to any of the  process - but this is a transaction cost of putting on an event like the Games.

We saw it in Melbourne. We saw it in Sydney in 2000. It happens in Glasgow, in the  Commonwealth Games there, it happens in all of these major sporting events.

We need to work with the countries, with the Commonwealth Games Commission and with  the state agencies to quickly work out the status of these individuals and if they're found  not to be owed protection, then they'll be deported at the first available opportunity.

QUESTION:



Just on another issue, are you disappointed that One Nation has decided to renege on the  deal that it had with the Government over company tax cuts?

PETER DUTTON:

I'll leave it to Mathias Cormann; but obviously the idea of the company tax cuts is that we  want to build on the success that we've had in creating a million jobs in our country. We  want to make sure that small business can do more business with big business so that they  can employ more apprentices, that they can buy another car, that they can expand their  office space - that's the way in which we grow the economy - and if business has the ability  to employ more staff, to pay more wages, in a healthy economy, then that is great for  families and for those small businesses.

So those discussions as I understand it will continue, but I have every faith - if anyone can  do a deal with the crossbenches it’s Mathias Cormann - so I’ll leave it to him.

QUESTION:

But has there been a problem with the Government’s sales pitch?

PETER DUTTON:

No, not at all.

QUESTION:

Paul Hanson’s claiming that the Government hasn’t been able to sell this on the ground and  the people that she speaks to don’t want the company tax cuts.

PETER DUTTON:

You have had the Labor Party running a scare campaign because they want to spend like  they always spend. Bill Shorten is the most Left leaning leader of the Labor Party since  Gough Whitlam and we saw what happened when Whitlam was in power; they just spent  money like it was going out of fashion. That’s exactly the formula that Bill Shorten is  applying now and Bill Shorten has scared the Australian people, but ultimately the  Australian people understand the benefit of making businesses profitable so that they can  employ more people, so that they can pay higher wages.

QUESTION:

Just on Comm Games Minister, what is your message to those 50 outstanding or to those  who are sheltering?

PETER DUTTON:

Well my message to the 50 is that the Australian public won’t be taken for a ride. We aren’t  going to tolerate people that come here on visas that have been issued in good faith and  then take advantage of our system.

We want to see those 50 people present themselves to the Australian Border Force because  if they don’t Border Force will find out where they are, they will be taken into Immigration  Detention and they will be deported.

There will be many of the 190 that have applied for Protection visas who are just trying it  on. My message to them is that they need to consider their position very carefully as well  because we are not going be taken for a ride and we are going to have a look very closely at  those individual applications.

There are millions of people who would want to come to our country tomorrow. We have  an orderly migration process in this country. We aren’t going to allow people to jump  queues or to seek some sort of preferential arrangement for themselves. We have a proper  process in place. We are a generous country in terms of the number of refugees and others  that we bring in, but we don’t tolerate people who take advantage of the Australian public.

QUESTION:

How long do you think it will take to sort this out?

PETER DUTTON:

It will take some time and as you know Australia has a generous system in terms of legal  appeals and processes and pro bono lawyers who seek to take advantage of the generosity  in the system. We will work through it as quickly as we can, but our clear message is to  those people that are disengaged with the Department at the moment, to contact the

Australian Border Force so that we can commence processes to deport those people from  our country.
