Budget shows cuts to humanitarian intake

Cutting 20,000 places from Australia's humanitarian intake is cruel and unnecessary, Greens Immigration spokesperson Nick McKim says.

"The Liberals' decision to reduce Australia's humanitarian intake from 18,750 to 13,750 for the next four years is devastating to displaced people around the world and the millions of Australians who want a compassionate refugee policy," Senator McKim said.

"That is 20,000 men, women and children who will remain displaced because of deliberate decisions taken by this Government."

"The Liberals wear their heartlessness as a badge of pride."

"Instead of doing the bare minimum required of us as a global citizen, this Government is abandoning refugees so they can shovel out corporate welfare and tax cuts for the super wealthy."

"They are clawing back more than $900 million that should be spent helping people to rebuild their lives."

"This budget also reveals their plans to warehouse people on Christmas Island - an expensive and unnecessary move."
