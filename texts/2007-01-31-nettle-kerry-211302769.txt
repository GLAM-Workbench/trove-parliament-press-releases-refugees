Kerry Nettle, Senator for New South Wales





Greens Welcome release of Nauru detainee



Senator Nettle, 31st January 2007

Greens Senator Kerry Nettle today welcomed the release of detainee Muhammad  Faisal from detention after five years.

"The release of Muhammad Faisal, following a fresh security assessment by ASIO,  raises serious questions about the accuracy of ASIO assessments," Senator Nettle  said.

"This man's life has been ruined and his mental health destroyed because ASIO got it  wrong. What could possible have changed about Mr Faisal's security status during  five years detention in Nauru," asked Senator Nettle.

"Asylum seekers' claims should be assessed on their need to for protection, not on a  secret, bogus security assessment."

"After visiting him last year, I'm thrilled that Muhammad will be able to live in the  community. It's a shame for his mental health and Australia that it is five years too  late," Senator Nettle said.
