REVIEW OF BODIES CONDUCTING INQUIRIES

The Government has completed a revievr of over fifty bodies

of various kinds which have been conducting inquiries for the  Commonwealth. - .  :  ,  Â·  .  Â·  '

As a result of this review it has been decided that 14 bodies

.  will be terminated immediately. '  '

The remaining bodies have been given specific dates by which :

they will be expected to report. Most are expected to complete ":

their activities by 30 June 1976. .  . .  :

The bodies whose activities are to be terminated and those \

which are being directed or asked to report by certain dates ,  :

are shown on the attached list. .  '  .  Â·

It has also been decided to introduce other measures designed -

to keep the costs of continuing inquiries to a minimum.

These include the elimination as far as possible of overseas

and internal travel, restrictions on use of consultants and ~ '

maximum use of available departmental resources.

The Australian Government Publishing Service is to be made -

responsible for publishing reports and will aim at making "

significant savings on current estimates of their costs.

'  c - '  Ã¢ÂÂ   s

Ministers are being asked to review the operations of the large

number of continuing advisory bodies within their portfolios, with .

the aim of reducxnt their number and making savings in their, operations.

In addition the Government has decided thatÂ·, the Social

C W e l f a r e ’Commission and the Australian Housing Corporation,^* ^  y ÃÂ»  —

should be abolished while the functions of the Australian *

Development Assistance Agency and the Road Safety ana Standards '  .

r  Authority should be taken over by Government Departments.

The Government has taken these decisions on the basis

that the functions of the four bodies concerned can be .

\ .carried out more efficiently and cheaply and more properly

under Ministerial and Parliamentary control if conducted .  .

within a departmental framework. .  _  . . . .

The decision to abolish the Social Welfare Commission confirms

a decision of the previous Government.

The only function presently being performed by the Australian

Housing Corporation is the administration of the Defence

Service Homes Scheme. The Government is examining the best

method of administering this Scheme and will be consulting

with the R.S.L. in the m a t t e r .
