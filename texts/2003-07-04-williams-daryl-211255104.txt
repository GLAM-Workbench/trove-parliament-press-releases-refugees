Subject: US Military Commissions  …………………………………………………e&oe

ATTORNEY:

Thank you for coming out.  As you may be aware, the United States Government has  determined that military commissions will be set up to try suspected terrorists who are  detained at Guantanamo Bay. The US has determined the first list of detainees who are  eligible for trial by Military Commission. The US Government has not made the list public,  and the Australian Government did not intend to make public the fact that Mr Hicks’ name is  on that list.  It was out of concern for the privacy and safety of the detainees that that decision  was made. Mr Hicks’ family, through his lawyer, have in fact made it public, so it’s now in  the public arena.

REPORTER:

Why has Mr Hicks been chosen to be one [of those picked]?

ATTORNEY:

The United States Government has the detainees in military custody and the determination  has been made by the US Government under a Military Order made by the President, a  Military Commission Order made by the Secretary of Defence, and some instructions that are  made under that, that some people will be eligible for trial by the Military Commission.  It’s a  decision of the US Government.

REPORTER:

Have they given you a reason? Apart from saying it’s going to happen, have they given you a  reason why he’s been chosen?

ATTORNEY:

The US Government has made the determination under those documents I referred to, which  set out the nature of the Military Commissions, their jurisdiction, the crimes they deal with  and the processes. So it’s in accordance with those formal documents that the decision has  been taken.

REPORTER:

Has the Australian Government had any discussion with the US Government in the lead up to  this decision?

ATTORNEY:

The Australian Government has had very extensive discussions at a range of levels with US  Government authorities.  The purpose of the discussions from the Australian point of view

was to ensure that if any Australians are subject to Military Commission trial that the  processes are fair and transparent. In the course of those discussions it’s been established that  those tried before the Military Commissions will be entitled to the normal rights accorded to  an accused in a criminal court, such as a presumption of innocence, the requirement of proof  beyond reasonable doubt, access to legal representation, a right to silence without adverse

inference and access to witnesses and documents.

REPORTER:

So today’s decision meets with your approval?

ATTORNEY:

The Government has been in extensive discussions with the US Government authorities.   Those discussions will continue.  Our objective will be to ensure that any trial that is  undertaken of an Australian before a Military Commission is fair and transparent.

REPORTER:

Some of the information coming out today is that the death penalty could apply if he’s found  guilty. What is the Australian Government’s position on that if it applies to Mr Hicks?

ATTORNEY:

The Australian Government has made very plain to the US Government authorities that it  does not support the death penalty.  We have made it as plain as can possibly be that we don’t  support that.

REPORTER:

You would expect the US Government to hand over Mr Hicks if he is found guilty?

ATTORNEY:

At this time, Mr Hicks has not yet been charged, we don’t know whether he will be or with  what offences he’ll be charged.  If he is, then we can comment on the processes that might  follow. At this stage to go further would be to speculate.

REPORTER:

Mr Williams, can I just ask you about asylum seekers, the Opposition today is saying that the  Federal Government has deceived the public over the information about the migration zone.   What’s your reaction to that?

ATTORNEY:

Well, this is a matter for Mr Ruddock, but I’d reject any notion that the Government has  engaged in deception.
