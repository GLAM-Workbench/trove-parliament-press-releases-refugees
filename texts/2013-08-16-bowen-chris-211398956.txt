KOCH: Good morning, gents. Chris, first to you. Why would Peter Slipper think he  has any hope of retaining his seat?

BOWEN: Well, that's a matter for Peter, Kochie. He is entitled to run, he’s entitled to  put his case forward. Nobody should take any seat for granted. We have got a good  candidate, Bill Gissane there in the seat. Everybody is entitled to run. You know  there has been a lot of commentary about Peter's wife, well, wives and spouses in  politics put up with a lot and every so often they’ll want to speak out. At the end of  the day, we are all human beings with human feelings in politics and seeing a bit of  human emotion on display is not necessarily such a bad thing.

ARMYTAGE: Chris, she may have put up with more than most. Joe, do you think it  was an interesting decision by Inge to speak out about her husband the way she  did? Was it a good strategic move?

HOCKEY: Well, that’s up to her. Look, Peter slipper, left the LNP. He did a deal with  Julia Gillard to become the speaker and Kevin Rudd negotiated with him to try and  hold on to power. We don't want to have anything to do with him. He’s entitled to run  and the people will make their call.

KOCH: Alright guys, let's move on to the 'C' word dogging both parties - that is  costings. Tony Abbott was questioned about this again last night, have a look.

Grab of Abbott on 7:30: People will be under no doubt when they go to the polls  exactly how much we're going to spend, exactly how much we're going to save and  exactly how the budget bottom line will be better off overall.

KOCH: Okay Joe, so the buck stops with you on this. Why don’t you reveal the  costings now?

HOCKEY: Because we haven't announced all of our policies now. So I think it’s  pretty logical that you don't announce the costings for policies that you haven't  announced. So over the next three weeks we will roll out our agenda, as is  appropriate, as has always happened in every election from both parties and we’ll  reveal our costings then. In the interim, we will also announce savings, we’ll  announce how we are going to do it and how we are going to undergo a thorough  process -

KOCH:  - Okay, under that logic, you could release a policy on the last day of the  campaign and do the costings the night before? Is that the plan? How much time you  going to give us to actually analyse it all?

HOCKEY: Kochie, there is no-one better than you when it comes to finance, and I  know you can do it within minutes.

ARMYTAGE: Flattery will get you everywhere.

HOCKEY: I think it will, I think it will in this case.

ARMYTAGE: Chris, the Budget is massively in deficit, why do you keep making it  worse and then criticising the other side for what you say they will do in making cuts.

BOWEN: Well what is really going on here? What is really going on here is that the  Liberal Party has been at sixes and sevens on this and they know what they are  going to cut, they know their costings. They’ve told us already they put 200 policies  into the Parliamentary Budget Office, now Joe’s saying he needs another process.  What’s all this about? It’s because if they really told us early enough what they are  going to cut, they are afraid people won't vote for them. That’s what’s really going on  here.

Because they are going to have to cut health and schools and basic services to fill  their black hole. Now, we know what happened last time, last time Joe did a DIY  costing. He outsourced it to an accountancy firm and then they got fined afterwards  for professional misconduct and the Department of Finance found that nine out of ten  dollars in the savings were wrong, after the election. So really, this is not good  enough. There’s a process in place - It’s called the Charter of Budget Honesty. Peter  Costello introduced it, we’re complying with it, why’s it so hard for Joe?

HOCKEY: Yeah, do I get a word in here? The fundamental bottom line is this - every  number that Labor has put out over the last six years has been wrong. On the one  hand, Chris was saying we haven't put out savings, yet we said we’re getting rid of  the $10 billion Clean Energy Fund, we’re not going to proceed with an increase in  the refugee intake to 20,000, which saves over a billion dollars.

We said we’re not going to spend $180,000 on a study for ergonomic chairs for one  department, so we are going to stop the waste, we are going to make savings, but  importantly we are going to leave the budget bottom line better off.

BOWEN: All those aren't enough Joe, and you know it and you know you are going  to have to cut further to fill your budget hole - you know it Joe -

KOCH: Will you guarantee you won’t cut health or education?

HOCKEY: Well, Kochie, I’m not going to give any on-the-run guarantees, I don’t do  that. But I say to you in education - we said we are going to match the Government  on education spending over the next four years. We’ve said that.

KOCH: So you are not going to cut - that's a guarantee?

HOCKEY: The Government cut $1.2 billion in education and school funding between  the economic document Chris released a few days ago and the one released by  Treasury this week.

BOWEN: You know that is not true, Joe. You know it is not true -

HOCKEY:  - You cut the funding.

BOWEN: That’s not true. We have been negotiating with the States for months, Joe,  you know that -

HOCKEY: - You cut the funding -

BOWEN:  - The States have had plenty of opportunities to sign up for that funding,  Joe, you know that.

ARMYTAGE: I just want to ask you, Joe, you spoke to Seven's 'Sunday Night',  coming up this Sunday night about your battle with weight and Lap-Band surgery,  looking forward to seeing that. How much weight have you lost so far?

HOCKEY: Well, I've lost a bit. I don't think that was the purpose of the whole  interview. It wasn't about weight loss, I think it was more than that but yes, they  followed me around for a few months, I'm going to go for a walk when it is on,  because I don't think I can watch it but I am sure others will.

KOCH: We will be watching.

HOCKEY: And the Labor party I expect.

ARMYTAGE: It looks interesting.

KOCH: And playing touch footy with Fitzy - that’s a sight for sore eyes.

HOCKEY: I hope you were nice to me Kochie.

KOCH: Absolutely, you’d look good in a bandana too. Alright guys, we’ll see you  next week and good luck to those of you on the campaign trail this week.
