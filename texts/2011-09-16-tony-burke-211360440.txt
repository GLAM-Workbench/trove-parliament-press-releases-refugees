SUNRISE - BIG GUNS

16TH SEPTEMBER 2011

E&OE………………………………………………………………………………………

PRESENTER:

Our Big Guns of Politics are with us this morning, Environment Minister Tony  Burke and Shadow Treasurer Joe Hockey. Good morning to both of you. Joe,  Malcolm reckons Kevin's return is inevitable. What do you think, is he right?

JOE HOCKEY:

I think it's a matter for the Labor Party.

PRESENTER:

I’d like to know your view.

JOE HOCKEY:

But I think the problem is the Labor Party. I don't know if it is Kevin Rudd or  Simon Crean or Stephen Smith or Bill Shorten or whether Julia Gillard can  survive. That's up to the party but I think the problem is their party. It's up to  them. Over to you guys.

PRESENTER:

Tony, over to you, what do you reckon?

TONY BURKE:

Julia Gillard is the best person to be Prime Minister of Australia. We have got  big changes happening in the Australian economy at the moment. She is the  right person.

PRESENTER:

Alright, you've given us the answer, don't go to the spiel.

JOE HOCKEY:

That means that Tony Burke will be in charge of Christmas Island should Kevin  Rudd become Prime Minister again.

PRESENTER:

Tony, do you reckon Kevin's return would help Malcolm get the top job in the  other camp?

TONY BURKE:

I think that is where Joe’s answer comes in and that is a matter for Liberal  Party.

PRESENTER:

You guys are wet weeks.

TONY BURKE:

I don’t think it is lost on anyone that Malcolm thinks it would be good for former  leaders to be coming back.

PRESENTER:

Alright, as you both take the splinters out of your bottom, Tony, Kevin Rudd  may not be Julia Gillard's biggest problem. A large group of Labor MPs are  reportedly threatening to vote against the poker machine deal the PM has cut  with Tasmanian Independent Andrew Wilkie. The MPs want to save their seats.  There are 25 of them. Are you one?

TONY BURKE:

I'm certainly not one. Can I just quickly explain why? The clubs do incredibly  important work and what they say about the importance of what they do in the  community is true. As a local MP, I have had too many occasions where  someone comes to my office - and it's usually not the problem gambler - it's  more often the wife or the son or the daughter and they have come after the  money has gone. I can't look them in the eye and say we are currently doing  enough to deal with problem gambling. I see what happens and to be able to  have further steps about that - it doesn't undermine the good work that clubs do - I just can't ignore those people.

PRESENTER:

Okay, Joe but the point is Andrew Wilkie says he will withdraw support for the  Gillard  government if the pokie deal doesn't go through. So the government will basically lose power. Would the opposition agree to his reforms to try and get  his support?

JOE HOCKEY:

No, we won't. This is another example of a very poor solution to a problem. The  technology does not work. The only jurisdiction where it is being implemented, it  has failed. It is hugely expensive to implement and the fact of the matter is that  there are better ways, particularly through education, that you can get this  matter resolved. It is a sledge hammer to crack a nut and quite frankly the  government has got it wrong. Mr Wilkie, I understand where he is coming from -  and I sympathise in a lot of ways - but it's a technology issue. The government  solution is wrong.

PRESENTER:

Would you be able to offer up a compromise? If you were in power you might  appease him and may be able to find a solution.

JOE HOCKEY:

Well, our starting point is encouraging the clubs and pubs - which they do do -  to address the issue of problem gambling as they do with alcohol. But, not to  have a licencing system. You don't have a licence to consume alcohol and yet  there are still people that drink too much. You've got to have responsible  service. I think the clubs and pubs are doing a pretty good job in that, maybe  they can do more. Quite frankly, this is - even the Salvation Army have  criticised this proposal from the government.

PRESENTER:

Finally, Malaysia’s Home Affairs minister says his country is still committed to  the asylum seeker swap. Tony, can you still get the Malaysia deal up?

TONY BURKE:

I think it's one of those issues where we are at at the moment where both sides  of politics have to acknowledge what it is we agree on. We both agree that  offshore processing is an important thing to introduce. We have got a difference  of opinion about what countries that should happen in. I think the only way to  solve this is you have legislation that doesn't specify where the country should  be. It's up to the government of the day to determine that. But you put the  legislation through so no matter who is in government, the offshore processing  policy that they have can be implemented.

PRESENTER:

Joe, he has also criticised your alternative to send the asylum seekers to  Nauru, claiming it is highly unlikely to stop human traffickers. Do you need to  stop pushing Nauru?

JOE HOCKEY:

It doesn't surprise me that the Malaysians would be keen to do this deal. They  are sending 4,000 people here and receiving $300 million from the Gillard  government and we are only meant to be sending them 800 refugees and now,  the government can't even do that. It is a very good deal for Malaysia. There is  no surprise they support it. I just make this point, under this deal, there is not a  processing of applications in Malaysia, it is about dumping people in Malaysia.  Malaysia has tens of thousands of refugees. They just go into this long queue.  Whereas under the Nauru solution, their applications are actually processed on  Nauru and then they are repatriated - in 30% of cases to where they came from  because they weren't legitimate - and in the 70% of cases, they are repatriated  around the world. Only 43% of cases did they end up in Australia.

TONY BURKE:

On that, all the ones who got repatriated to other countries were right at the  beginning of Nauru. After they had been running for a couple of years,

everyone who was left only got sent to Australia. You can average the numbers  across the whole time but by the end, no other country would take people from  Nauru.

PRESENEER:

This is an issue we have talked about before. You are both very different in  your views. You can see why there is a bit of a stalemate. We have to cut it off,  thank you guys for joining us.

JOE HOCKEY:

Thanks Mel.
