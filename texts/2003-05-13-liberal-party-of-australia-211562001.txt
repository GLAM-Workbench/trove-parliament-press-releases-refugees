MPS 31/2003

The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Philip Ruddock, today announced the following key initiatives in the 2003-04 Budget:

Ã¢ÂÂ     A saving of $467 million over four years due to the success of off-shore processing, including:

Ã¢ÂÂ     a saving of $437 million over four years due to the reduction in the estimated number of illegal arrivals from 4500 to 1000 a year,

Ã¢ÂÂ     the number of people in offshore immigration facilities is down from 1500 a year ago to about 450 people, and

Ã¢ÂÂ     a saving of $30.7 million over four years as a result of rationalisation of onshore processing due to the opening of the Baxter

facility, and closure of Woomera IRPC.

Ã¢ÂÂ     $10 million over four years allocated for the development of a new profiling system to generate automatic alerts on visa applications from

people with profiles of concern.

Ã¢ÂÂ     These may include people potentially associated with the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, terrorist activities, and

other criminal or fraudulent activities.

Ã¢ÂÂ     This will deliver a more reliable system of alerts, rather than current arrangements that rely on manual alerts.

Ã¢ÂÂ     An additional $7.6 million allocated to DIMIA initiatives that will support the major package of measures announced tonight by the

Minister for Education, Science and Training to strengthen Australia's position as a significant provider of international education,  including in new and emerging markets.

Ã¢ÂÂ     Savings of $89.1 million over the next four years as a result of the introduction of a two-stage business skills visa from 1 March 2003.

Ã¢ÂÂ     Under the new arrangements, most applicants for the business skills visa are first granted a temporary resident visa, which does not

give them access to the full range of Government programs until they successfully establish a business and thereby obtain  permanent residence.

Ã¢ÂÂ     Reforms to the Assurance of Support scheme are designed to improve its integrity and to strengthen and simplify its administration.

Ã¢ÂÂ     Some processing currently undertaken by DIMIA will be undertaken by Centrelink whilst significant savings will be achieved in

the Family, and

Ã¢ÂÂ     Community Services portfolio as a result of reduced income support claims from sponsored migrants and improved recovery of

social security debts accruing under the Assurance of Support scheme.
