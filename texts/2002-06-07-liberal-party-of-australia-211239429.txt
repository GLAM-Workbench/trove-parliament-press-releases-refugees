NEW REGULATIONS TO FIGHT PEOPLE SMUGGLERS

The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Philip Ruddock, announced  today  that  the  Government  has  made  new  regulations  to  fight  people smugglers.

Mr Ruddock said the regulations extend the area of excised offshore places from the migration zone and will cover islands off the north west of Western Australia, islands off the Northern Territory and islands off far north Queensland (essentially the islands of the Torres Strait) as well as the Coral Sea Island Territories.

This  announcement  follows  legislation  introduced  by  the  Government  last  year  to excise  Cocos  (Keeling)  Island,  Christmas  Island,  Ashmore  Reef  and  Cartier  Reef from Australia’s migration zone.

The  Minister  said  this  will  prevent  unauthorised  arrivals  who  may  land  on  these excised islands from applying for a visa.

“It is clear that strategies proposed by the Government and passed by Parliament in September  last  year  have  had  a  significant  impact  on  stopping  people  smugglers bringing unauthorised boat arrivals to Australia,” Mr Ruddock said.

“However the  Government  has  been  aware  that  despite  the  success  to date of  this earlier legislation, smugglers might be thinking of trying to bring unauthorised arrivals through areas of Northern Australia not excised to date.”

Mr  Ruddock  said  experience  had  shown  boats  had  primarily arrived  in  the  north  of Australia.  Consequently  the  following  additional  locations  have  been  prescribed  as ‘excised offshore places’:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The Coral Sea Islands Territory,

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ All islands in the far north of Queensland (north of latitude 120 south) - essentially The Torres Strait islands,

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ All islands forming part of the territory of The Northern Territory,

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ All Western Australia islands situated north of latitude 230 south.

“The  inclusion  of  these  islands  to  be  excised  from  the  migration  zone  only  affects unauthorised  arrivals.  Australian  citizens  and  others  with  lawful  authority  under  the Migration  Act  to  be  in  Australia  continue  to  be  able  to  move  about  freely  in  these areas and make any applications permitted by that Act.

The  provisions  in  the  Migration  Act  allowing  inhabitants  of  the  Protected  Zone (established  by  the  Torres  Strait  Treaty)  to  move  about  freely  to  perform  their traditional  activities  will  continue  to  apply.  Therefore  traditional  inhabitants  of  the Torres Strait will not be affected by the inclusion of the new excised offshore places.

“As  with  unauthorised  arrivals  at  other  excised  places  in  the  past,  Australia  will continue to meet its obligations under the Refugee Convention to any people arriving at the new excised places.”
