Greens message to SA voters: ‘don’t get caught out on election day’

The Australian Greens have launched a television commercial today telling South  Australian voters that they need to know where their vote will go at this election.

“South Australian voters need to make sure that they’re not caught out at this election,”  South Australian Greens Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.

“Many progressive voters will be shocked to hear that Nick Xenophon is directing his  preferences to the major parties, giving Tony Abbott a big leg up towards controlling the  Senate in September.

“The simplest way for voters to make sure they don’t get caught out is to vote 1 Greens.

“If you want a humane approach on refugees, if you want someone to stand up for the  environment and renewable energy, if you don’t want Tony Abbott to have full control of  the parliament, you have one choice: Vote Greens.”
