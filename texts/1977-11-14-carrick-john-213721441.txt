HOW LABOR FORGOT THE MIGRANTS

When in government Mr. Whitlam ignored the plight of the  non-English speaking migrants, which he has now so belatedly Ã¢ÂÂ  discovered.

In 1975 the Whitlam government froze enrolments in adult  migrant education at the 1974 level of 75,000 although there  was a great increase in demand for courses.

It did so in the full knowledge that a survey entitled  "A Decade of Migrant Settlement" undertaken in 1973 revealed  a serious situation.

The survey showed that, of heads of migrant households, 54.4 per cent of Italians, 61.1 per cent of Greeks and  70.6 per cent of Yugoslavs had not undertaken any form of  English language course.

That situation was likely to have been even worse for other  family members, particularly women.

In the first year of .the Fraser government 1976-77 enrolments  in adult migrant education rose to 88,000, a 17.3 per cent  increase.

This financial year the Commonwealth expenditure on adult  migrant education will be $11,878 million compared with  $8,237 million in the last Whitlam year, an increase of  44.3 per cent.

New initiatives to be taken by the Fraser government this year  will include :

. extra funds for State Adult Migrant Education Services,  including $867,000 over and above their 1977/78 Budget  allocations as part of a special allocation of $2,359  million announced in October 1977;

. supplementary full-time courses at tertiary institutions,  with a special additional allocation of $83,000 announced  in October;

. additional 'on arrival' English language programs for Ã¢ÂÂ  refugees, with an extra $964,000 having been announced in  October;

2 ,

. new full-time vacation English language courses to be held  between December 1977 and January 1978 (additional $290,000) , *

. further initiatives in English language courses at the work  place, and an experimental project teaching English using  cable television in a high rise block (additional $45,000);

Ã¢ÂÂ increased living allowances for migrants in full-time courses  to raise them to the level of unemployment benefits  (additional $260,000).
