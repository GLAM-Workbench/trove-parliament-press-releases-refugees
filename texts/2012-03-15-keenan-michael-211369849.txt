Topics: Labor’s cuts to Customs

Mike Jeffreys

The Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and Border Protection Michael Keenan is on the line, Hello  Michael, thanks for your time.

Michael Keenan

Good to talk to you Mike.

Mike Jeffreys

So could it have been different? Is this down to the Federal Government, if they had done it a little  differently could this all have been stopped?

Michael Keenan

Look I can’t comment specifically on this individual case but what I can say is that because of the  Federal Governments extensive cuts to the federal crime fighting agencies, in particular Customs and  Border Protection, the chances of us stopping illegal weapons or other illegal things such as drugs or  other contraband at our borders, is being greatly reduced. The cut in particular that worries me the  most is they really savaged Customs ability to screen cargo when it comes into Australia. So these  guns that you have been talking about would have come in through the air and because of the savage  cuts they made, there is 75% less air cargo inspections when they come into Australia than there was  when this Labor Government came to power. Clearly that gives criminal organisations a much better  likelihood of getting that stuff into the country.

Mike Jeffreys

For years I have been hearing stories about guns coming into this country illegally but most of the  stories, and I stress that they are just stories, although I’m inclined to think that there might be some  truth to them, suggests that the guns are coming into remote areas but in this case we are talking  about something that actually happened directly in the city. Now I don’t expect you to hone in on this  case specifically but the mere fact that this is happening, that it is possible to smuggle these guns right  into the city of Sydney, and the reason we discovered it was because the criminals are so foolish and

dangerous that they’re shooting their guns of in the street. If there hadn’t been this attention brought to  it, I just wonder how long it would have gone on for?

Michael Keenan

It is pretty disturbing and obviously what we would like to see is federal crime fighting agencies with all  the resources that they need to do their job. The agencies involved in this particular bust have done a  great job, including the Australian Federal Police, the Australian Crime Commission, Customs and  Border Protection Service and the NSW Police, but if they were resourced properly, if they hadn’t been  subject to savage personnel and budget cuts then clearly their chances of a positive operation are a lot  better and that is what we would like to see happen and to see that happen we need to see some of  those funding cuts restored.

Mike Jeffreys

Yeah it does come down to resources. I lived in Canberra for awhile and I got to know some of the  Customs boys and they are not bad guys and they take their job seriously but they have told me  stories about a lack of resources. If they don’t have the resources then the fact of the matter is the  criminals get to know where the weaknesses are.

Michael Keenan

They are great guys and they do a great job for our country but they are not being supported by this  current Government. You don’t need to spend that long with customs officers just talking to them to  learn that they feel like they work for an agency that is completely under siege by Julia Gillard and her  Labor Government because they just don’t prioritise the work that Customs and Border Protection do.  They have cut their budget in the cargo screening area but also in ten other ways as well. They are just

making it impossible for these guys to do their job properly and this is a time when they are under  enormous pressure because they are heavily involved in dealing with Labor’s border protection crisis in  the north of our country. It is an agency that is really struggling to do what we ask it to do thanks to  these Labor funding cuts.

Mike Jeffreys

So do you see those two things as being linked because they are stretched thin having to deal with the  asylum seeker problem, because quote on quote they are not able to devote enough time to what we  would consider to be the more traditional job that Customs has?

Michael Keenan

They are completely linked. It is not just Customs but also other government agencies as well but  certainly in the case of Customs they are so preoccupied with dealing with the border protection crisis  that it makes it much more difficult for them to concentrate on their other duties. They are doing it at a  time when their resources and personnel are significantly lower than when the Government changed in  2007. They are operating in an exceptionally difficult environment, they are still doing a good job in that  environment, but they can clearly do a better job if they had more resources and more manpower.

Mike Jeffreys

Now on the other hand the Home Affairs Minister Jason Clare has said it is a bit rich of the Opposition  to be talking about these Customs cuts when the coalition want to get rid of 12,000 public servants if  they win Government. What do you say to that?

Michael Keenan

Well it is a matter of priorities. We will not cut frontline personnel dealing with border protection or law  enforcement. There is no way that we would cut personnel or funding from those agencies. We will  restore some of the cuts that Labor has made and it is really just about priorities so when we are  talking about having a look at the size of the public service, we certainly won’t be having a look at law  and order frontline agencies who are doing an exceptional job in very hard and difficult circumstances.
