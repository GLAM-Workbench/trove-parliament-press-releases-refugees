PRIME MINISTER



SUPPORTING THE TERRITORY



I am delighted to announce today a package of $152 million over 4 years of new initiatives to  build on the Coalition Government’s support for the people of the Territory over the past 8½  years.

The Territory’s unique environment and isolation from the rest of Australia presents many  challenges and opportunities to its people.  It is important for the people of the Territory to  know that the Australian Government, representing all Australians, is committed to  supporting them.

The Coalition Government’s competent and disciplined economic management is enabling  the full potential of communities and businesses of the Territory to be developed.  The  economic and resource development opportunities in the Territory are huge.

The package I am announcing today includes the following new initiatives:  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ $49.5 million to make the Royal Darwin Hospital a National Centre for Critical Care and  Trauma.  This project, a major boost for the Territory and a major boost for Australia’s  capacity to care for victims of trauma and terrorism in our region, is the subject of a

separate announcement.  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ A $100 million investment in the Territory’s roads.  This includes funding for Tiger  Brennan Drive and the Stuart Highway and for the Outback Highway linking through to

Kalgoorlie.  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ $2 million to assist the Charles Darwin University for improved technology infrastructure.

This package builds on other major Coalition commitments to the people of the Territory that  have already been announced, including:  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ the establishment of a Medicare Office in Palmerston.  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ the abolition of entry fees for the Kakadu National Park.

The Territory will also share in the benefits of a number of recent national initiatives targeted  to community, business, infrastructure and security needs typically found in the Territory:  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ additional funds to improve terrestrial mobile phone coverage.  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ improved security at regional airports and maritime ports, through the installation of

closed circuit television (CCTV) units.  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ a $50 million National Crime Prevention Programme to fund grass roots community  projects around Australia.  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ A significant expansion of opportunities throughout Australia.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Funds for financial literacy training and entrepreneurial skills development for Indigenous  Australians.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Other initiatives for Indigenous Australians, including a Youth Leadership Programme  and a mobility programme for young Indigenous people.

Taken together, this large range of projects and initiatives demonstrates the Coalition’s  continuing commitment to the people of the Territory.  Under a re-elected Coalition  Government, the Territory’s unique communities will be supported and Territory businesses  will have an assured future.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The Coalition Government is committed to supporting the Northern  Territory.

The Northern Territory is well placed to benefit from economic and  resource development opportunities.

Through its sound economic management the Coalition Government  has provided a sound basis on which businesses and communities in  the Northern Territory can develop their potential.

Today's announcement of a package of new initiatives builds on our  work over the past 8 1/2 years.

A re-elected Coalition Government will:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ commit $49.5 million over four years to make the Royal  Darwin Hospital a National Centre for Critical Care and  Trauma;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ provide a package of infrastructure assistance for Northern  Territory roads of almost $100 million compared to Labor’s  $80 million.  This includes $10 million for the Outback  Highway, $13.7 million for Tiger Brennan Drive and $20  million for the Stuart Highway;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ establish a Medicare office in Palmerston;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ abolish entry fees for Kakadu National Park;

Supporting the Territory 3

PART 1  REGIONAL EMERGENCY SERVICES & TRAUMA  CARE

Darwin is not only the gateway to Northern Australia.  It is on the  doorstep of Indonesia and Melanesia, a region with which we have a  close and intertwined relationship.

We are affected by events to our Near North, whether they have  natural or man-made causes.

The Darwin health community is regularly called upon to provide  emergency services for Australians injured overseas and oil rigs in the  Timor Sea, as well as major emergencies like the Bali bombing or the  conflict in East Timor.

The efforts of the Northern Territory’s emergency service and health  professionals in assisting in major regional events and crises has  earned them national and international respect.  Their skill and  diligence has been vital in saving the lives of Australians and our  neighbours, particularly the young Australians and Indonesians who  were victims of the Bali bombings.

Recognising the vital national importance of this work over and above  the normal responsibilities of the Royal Darwin Hospital to the Territory  and Top End communities, a re-elected Coalition Government will  commit $49.5 million over four years to make Royal Darwin Hospital a  National Centre for Critical Care and Trauma.



PART 2  ROADS

A re-elected Coalition Government will provide a package of  infrastructure assistance for Northern Territory roads of almost $100  million compared to Labor’s $80 million.

This includes $10 million for the Outback Highway, $13.7million for  Tiger Brennan Drive and $20 million for the Stuart Highway.

Outback Highway

A re-elected Coalition Government will provide $10 million over the  three years 2004-05 to 2006-07 under AusLink's Roads to Recovery  Strategic Fund to upgrade priority sections of the Outback Highway to  an all-weather standard.

This funding will help towards the aim of the Outback Highway to  provide an all-weather link across the middle of Australia from Laverton  in Western Australia to Boulia in Queensland.

Supporting the Territory 4

The Outback Highway links to the Adelaide to Darwin rail line.  It  provides a freight link for mining opportunities and primary production  while also providing tourism opportunities for the region.

Western Australia, Northern Territory and Queensland and local  authorities will also need to contribute to the task of upgrading this link.

Presently of the 2,696km, 1,040km is sealed while 1,656km is  unsealed.  This funding will help to bring part of this unsealed area up  to an all-weather gravel road standard.

The Outback Highway cuts 1,000km off a journey from Perth to  Northern Queensland.

This funding is in addition to the recently announced additional money  for unincorporated areas, which part of this road travels through.

The Coalition’s commitment to the Outback Highway is another  example of our dedication to delivering results to where it matters - on  the ground.

It is only through the Coalition Government’s sound economic  management we are able to invest in our road and rail infrastructure  such as the Outback Highway.

Tiger Brennan Drive

A re-elected Coalition Government will provide $13.7 million towards  upgrading the road access to East Arm Port including construction of a  rail overpass.

This will increase freight efficiency and help strengthen Darwin’s trade  opportunities.

Stuart Highway

The Labor Party has announced only $14 million for the Stuart  Highway - $6 million less than that promised by the Coalition  Government in its AusLink White Paper.

The Coalition Government will deliver $20 million to the Stuart Highway  widening and reconstruction and we call on Labor to match the funding  on this important infrastructure project.



PART 3  MEDICARE OFFICE

The Coalition Government is committed to providing the Australian  community with access to Medicare services.  Recognising the needs  of the Palmerston community, the Coalition Government will establish a  Medicare office in Palmerston.

Supporting the Territory 5



PART 4  NATURAL HERITAGE

Kakadu is one of Australia’s key natural wonders and a major tourist  attraction for the Northern Territory.  Recognising the cultural and  economic value of this unique area, the Coalition will abolish entry fees  for Kakadu National Park.



PART 5  COMMUNICATIONS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY

(i) Extended mobile phone coverage

The Coalition Government continues to improve mobile phone  coverage across Australia.

In response to the Estens Inquiry into regional telecommunications the  Coalition Government has committed another $15.6 million to further  improve terrestrial mobile phone coverage.  As part of this programme,  the Government announced on 1 September 2004 it will be funding  mobile phone coverage for 13 sites in the Northern Territory:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢  Bamyii  (Barunga)   Ã¢ÂÂ¢  Beswick

Ã¢ÂÂ¢  Cooinda

Ã¢ÂÂ¢  Dagaragu-Kalkaringi   Ã¢ÂÂ¢  Daly  River

Ã¢ÂÂ¢  Galiwinku

Ã¢ÂÂ¢  Gapuwiyak   Ã¢ÂÂ¢  Maningrida   Ã¢ÂÂ¢  Milikapiti

Ã¢ÂÂ¢  Milingimbi   Ã¢ÂÂ¢  Pirlangimpi   Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Warrabri (Ali Currung)  Ã¢ÂÂ¢  Warruwi



(ii) Broadband access for the Northern Territory

The Coalition Government established the Higher Bandwidth Incentive  Scheme (HiBIS) in response to the Estens Inquiry into regional  telecommunications.

HiBIS is a $107.8 million programme to provide people in regional,  rural and remote Australia with access to affordable broadband  services.  Under the programme a registered HiBIS service provider  gets a subsidy for each eligible customer they sign.  Any service  provider can register to be part of the scheme.

There are currently 10 registered HiBIS providers.  Of these, three offer  HiBIS broadband services nationally.

Supporting the Territory 6

Under HiBIS Telstra has significantly reduced the required interest  level needed to trigger the upgrade of its telephone exchanges to  support ADSL broadband at the following Northern Territory locations:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢  Larapinta

Ã¢ÂÂ¢  Tennant  Creek   Ã¢ÂÂ¢  Nhulunbuy



(iii) Information Technology Infrastructure - Charles Darwin University

A re-elected Coalition Government will also provide $2 million to assist  the Charles Darwin University to improve information technology  infrastructure.

This is in addition to the $2.4 million provided by the Coalition  Government to improve bandwidth for institutions in the Northern  Territory.



PART 6  BORDER PROTECTION

The Coalition Government’s Securing Our Regional Skies package will  ensure that regional aviation passengers in the Northern Territory are  secure through improvements in staff training and the availability of  Rapid Deployment Teams of AFP Protective Services officers who are  able to respond to security threats quickly.

Increased Customs staffing numbers, announced in July 2004, will  ensure that remote ports such as Gove have greater flexibility in  remote area patrolling and first port boarding capability.

Security will be further improved by an increased CCTV network in  Northern Territory ports.

Eleven CCTV units will be installed at the Port of Milner Bay (Groote  Eylandt) and ten at the Port of Melville Bay (Gove), which together with  the existing 14 CCTV installations at the Port of Darwin ensure that  Customs CCTV network remains a world leader in port security.



PART 7  CRIME PREVENTION & COMMUNITY SAFETY

(i)  Drug Rehabilitation



The Coalition Government has played an active role in crime  prevention in the Northern Territory.

As announced on 15 September 2004, the Coalition will provide  $304,183 to fund a 20 bed drug rehabilitation facility in the Northern  Territory.  This funding was made possible through the Coalition’s  Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, which enables money made from criminal

Supporting the Territory 7

activity to be seized and applied to projects to counter the effects of  drug and crime in the community.

(ii)  Community Crime Prevention

The Coalition Government’s National Community Crime Prevention  Programme has funded two local crime prevention initiatives in the  Northern Territory.

Both Aboriginal Resources and Development Inc in Nhulunbuy and the  Tangentyere Council in Alice Springs received $150,000 under the  NCCPP.

The NCCPP’s community grants programme aims to support local  grass roots crime prevention projects by providing additional resources  often needed by community groups to develop their own projects and  find their own ways of getting people to work together for the common  goal of promoting community safety.

The Aboriginal Resources and Development Inc’s Rom Ga Dharra  project will produce educational material about the Australian legal  system in local indigenous languages.  This project will provide the  Yolgnu people living in Darwin with essential information about  contemporary Australian law, and will also broadcast educational  material over the Community Development Radio Service.

The Tangentyere Council’s Night Patrol Brokerage project will provide  funds to enable the Tangentyere Remote Area Night Patrol (RANP) to  respond quickly to requests for assistance from remote night patrols in  the Central Desert region.  It will also allow the RANP to co-ordinate  training and other resource needs for the 20 remote Northern Territory  communities located south of Tennant Creek.

The Coalition has committed $50 million to funding grass roots  community projects like these under the NCCPP over the next four  years.

(iii)  Juvenile  Crime



The Northern Territory Juvenile Diversion Agreement provided  $20 million over four years to establish a pre-court juvenile diversion  scheme and to jointly fund the Aboriginal Interpreter Service.  As part  of this arrangement, four Northern Territory Aboriginal Legal Aid  Services were contracted to provide funding for them to purchase  interpreter services for criminal cases from the Aboriginal Interpreter  Service.

In 2004-05, a further $3.9 million was committed to extend the  Agreement.



Supporting the Territory 8

PART 8  INCREASED SUPPORT FOR APPRENTICES

At present, New Apprentices who move away from their family home to  take up, or remain in, a New Apprenticeship are provided with an  allowance to assist them with the cost of living away from home for the  first two years of their Apprenticeship.

Building on this, a re-elected Coalition Government will provide an  additional $5 million over three years from 1 July 2005 to provide  residential support across Australia for these New Apprentices in their  third year.

New Apprentices will now receive:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ $77.17 per week in the first twelve months of their New  Apprenticeship,

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ $38.59 per week in the second twelve months, and

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ $25.00 per week in the third twelve months.



The number of New Apprentices in the Northern Territory has grown by  241 per cent since 1996 and this initiative will encourage more  Australians into trades.

Further significant announcements in relation to apprenticeships and  skills shortages will be made during the course of the election  campaign.



PART 9  INDIGENOUS AUSTRALIANS

The Coalition Government believes Indigenous Australians, wherever  they live, should have the same opportunities as other Australians to  make informed choices about their lives, to realise their full potential in  whatever they choose to do and to take responsibility for managing  their own affairs.

The Coalition Government will spend $3.1 billion in 2004-05 on  Indigenous specific programmes - 39 percent more in real terms than  in the last Budget of the Keating Labor Government.

The Coalition Government has shown that it is prepared to make the  tough decisions.  We made the decision to abolish ATSIC.  But this is  only one part of the radically overhauled delivery of Indigenous  services that a re-elected Coalition Government will introduce.

From 1 July 2004 there has been a renewed emphasis on Indigenous  affairs.

There is increased funding for Indigenous services, and an insistence  that Indigenous Australians get better value for this money.

Supporting the Territory 9



Mainstream agencies will be held to account for their performance in  Indigenous servicing.

A re-elected Coalition Government will continue to strip away layers of  bureaucracy, making it easier for Indigenous communities to have a  say in the services that they receive.

Government agencies will be located closer to the people they serve,  and will coordinate their activities to provide a simple, flexible “one stop  shop”.

A re-elected Coalition Government will establish a National Indigenous  Council of eminent Indigenous Australians who are experts in their  fields. The new Council will advise the Ministerial Taskforce on  Indigenous Affairs about policy priorities and development and  implementation of new initiatives.

Indigenous Australians will have greater say in the delivery of  Government programmes to their families and communities.  Local  communities will have greater say in their children’s future.  Funding  decisions will be made on a bottom up basis, according to need.   Responsibility for outcomes will be shared with local communities.

There will be an increased focus on assistance to remote communities  with funding being directed to where it is most needed.

Education, economic development and mobility programmes will be an  important part of the strategy for these communities. Unconditional  welfare will become a thing of the past.

Three key strategic areas will be given priority:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Early childhood intervention and the improvement of  primary health and early education outcomes, to head off  longer term problems.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Safer communities, with an emphasis on law and order.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Reducing dependency on passive welfare, and stimulating  employment and economic development in Indigenous  communities.

A re-elected Coalition Government will:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Provide $4.5 million over four years for financial literacy  training and entrepreneurial skills development as part of a  broad Economic Independence Strategy.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Provide new funding in addition to initiatives announced in  the 2004-05 Budget to strengthen governance, leadership  and capacity.  This will involve funding of:

- $10 million over four years for an Indigenous  Youth Leadership programme, including school

Supporting the Territory 10

based scholarships for remote areas, tertiary  scholarships, internships and structured study  tours. An elders’ mentoring group will support the  programme.

- $2 million over four years to assist communities to  develop a 20-30 year vision to guide government  interventions as part of the Coalition approach to  capacity building in Indigenous communities.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Provide $19 million over four years to establish a mobility  programme to help young Indigenous Australians in areas  of economic disadvantage to participate in apprenticeship  and tertiary training courses in capital cities and provincial  centres. Counselling and supported accommodation will be  provided through Aboriginal Hostels Limited. We will  establish Indigenous specific pre-vocational training  courses with post-training employment placement support.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Provide $4 million for the development and promotion of  Indigenous art throughout Australia and $2 million for six  additional artworks for Reconciliation Place in Canberra.





PART 10 DEFENCE

The spending for Defence capital facilities projects in Northern Territory  as announced in the May 2004 Budget totalled approximately $102  million.

This investment includes:  Ã¢ÂÂ¢  provision  of  engineering  services  and  infrastructure  so   Bradshaw  can  be  used  as  a  field  training  area  for  1st   Brigade  -  total  cost  $64.8  million  with  expenditure  of  $24

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ upgrade to Cooling Towers at RAAF Tindal ($0.3 million)

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ refurbishment at Darwin naval base; and

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ environmental condition monitoring at Bradshaw field  training area.



Navy

Navy operates one base in Northern Territory, the Darwin  Naval Base HMAS Coonawarra which is located within  Larrakeyah Barracks in Darwin.

The principal role is to support patrol boat operations in the  Northern Australian area.

HMAS Coonawarra currently supports 10 Fremantle Class  Patrol Boats and two heavy landing craft and a small number  of Army watercraft.

Work is to begin shortly to enhance the support facilities for the  new Armidale Class Patrol Boats which will be progressively  introduced into service from May 2005 to replacing the ageing  Fremantles.

Army

Darwin is home to the 1st Brigade, the Australian Army's light  armoured brigade and work base for more than 3400 civilian  and military personnel.

The 1st Brigade is a high readiness light armoured formation  with excellent tactical mobility, a high level of endurance, hard  hitting firepower and sophisticated communications.

It is capable of conducting light armoured operations in mid-intensity conventional warfare and peace operations with UN  and/or coalition forces.

As an adaptable and versatile formation the Brigade is capable  of conducting peace operations concentrating on  peacekeeping.

HIGHLIGHTS OF THE GOVERNMENT’S ACHIEVEMENTS

Since it was elected in 1996, the Coalition Government has invested  significantly in the Northern Territory, including:



(i) Roads & Rail Funding



Since the Coalition Government took office in 1996, around $220  million has been spent on the upgrade of the National Highway and  Roads of National Importance in the Northern Territory.

The Coalition is committed under AusLink to the continued upgrade of  the National Network through in Northern Territory.

The Coalition Government is committed to spend around $75 million on  the National Network (not including additional maintenance funding) in  the Northern Territory over the next five years including:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢

Ã¢ÂÂ¢

Ã¢ÂÂ¢

$13.7 to upgrade the Tiger Brennan Drive and Berrimah Road  access to the Port of Darwin at East Arm;

$20 million for upgrading bridges and flood immunity on the  Victoria Highway; and

$20 million for the widening and rehabilitation of the Stuart  Highway.



The Coalition Government has allocated $24 million under the first four  years of the Roads to Recovery programme.

Approximately $35 million will be provided in the next four years for  Roads to Recovery including over $15 million for roads in  unincorporated areas.

Almost $5 million has been provided to improve the safety of Northern  Territory roads since 1996-97 under the National Black Spot  Programme.

Labor abandoned this important programme when they were in  government.

The Coalition Government has provided $191.4 million and delivered  on the construction of the Alice Springs to Darwin rail line which  completes the interstate rail link providing opportunities for greater  choice freight services.

(ii)  Medicare  Safety  Net



The new Medicare Safety Net reimburses 80 percent of out of pocket  medical costs for services provided out of hospital once annual family

Supporting the Territory 14

or individual expenditure reaches a threshold of $300 (concession card  holders and recipients of Family Tax Benefit Part A) or $700 (all other  people).

This provides peace of mind to all Australians and tangible benefits to  some 640,000 Australians - including family members and individuals -  who have already reached their Safety Net threshold.

The Safety Net is the most substantial addition to Medicare since its  inception in 1983.

Amazingly, the Labor Party proposes to abolish the Safety Net if it wins  the election.  This makes Labor the only party proposing a cut in a  major health benefit.

Residents of the Northern Territory are sharing in the benefits of the  Safety Net.  Some 2,104 people, including family members and  individuals, have reached their Safety Net threshold and are already  receiving benefits.

These people are among the many who would stand to lose if Labor  came into office and abolished the Safety Net.

(iii)  Aged  Care



The Coalition has allocated 557 residential and community aged care  package places in the Northern Territory since 1995-96.

(iv)  Communications



The Coalition Government has worked hard to improve  communications services in the Northern Territory.

Mobile phone coverage was funded in three towns in the Northern  Territory with populations under 500 and in seven towns with  populations over 500 in response to the Telecommunications Services  Inquiry.

In an area the size of the Northern Territory it will never be  economically viable to have terrestrial mobile coverage everywhere.   However the Coalition recognises that mobile communications can be  extremely important to people working and living in remote areas for  safety reasons and for staying in contact with family and friends.

To ensure that people living and working in areas without terrestrial  mobile phone coverage do have access to mobile communications, the  Coalition Government established and recently extended the Satellite  Phone Subsidy Scheme.  Under the scheme customers can get a  subsidy of 80 percent or $1,500 off the cost of a satellite phone  handset.

Supporting the Territory 15

The Coalition established the Coordinated Communications  Infrastructure Fund to support improved broadband access for the  health and education sectors in regional Australia.  In a project funded  under the CCIF, a series of research and education institutions in the  Desert Knowledge Precinct south of Alice Springs will be connected to  the Charles Darwin University network.

The Coalition Government’s successful TV Blackspots programme has  funded 67 projects to improve Television reception in the Northern  Territory.

(v) Stronger Families and Communities

Since 2001 the Coalition Government has provided $5,046,757 to 54  projects under the Stronger Families and Communities Strategy.   Projects supported include:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢

Ã¢ÂÂ¢

Ã¢ÂÂ¢

Family As Community for Ngarkte Mikwekenhe Community Inc.  ($180,000) - The project uses kinship networks and extended  family as 'community' to build social capital and capacity by  funding services to address needs identified by the 'family  community', such as returning to traditional lands, but  maintaining access to education or developing enterprises to  reduce unemployment

Multicultural Council Family Officer: ($117,068) - The  employment of a NESB Women's Officer based at the  Multicultural Council would address the needs of immigrant and  refugee women through the provision of training

Parents with a mental illness ($332,000) Support worker to help  parents with mental illnesses.



(vi) Support for Volunteers



Since 2001 the Coalition Government has provided $241,533 in Small  Equipment Grants to 89 projects.

(vii)  Water



Following the Coalition Government’s announcement of its national  water policy, Securing Australia’s Water Future, the Northern Territory  community also has the opportunity to bid for projects under the $2  billion Australian Water Fund and the Water Wise Communities  initiative.

(viii)  Apprenticeships



The number of New Apprentices in the Northern Territory has  increased from 750 to 2,560 since 1996 (a 241 per cent increase).

The Coalition has provided $874,280 to Top End Group Training to  place 220 School Based New Apprentices in the Northern Territory.

Supporting the Territory 16



The Coalition has since 2001 provided $975,763 for Skills Centres for  School Students in the Northern Territory.

Examples include:

$193,991 in 2002 to Darwin High School for a new skill centre  for multimedia and music;

$89,502 in 2001 and $33,498 in 2002 to Casuarina Senior  College to develop a business services/cultural/information  technology skill centre and an electro technology skill centre  respectively; and

$250,550 in 2001 and $146,606 in 2002 to Taminmin High  School for an automotive and engineering training facility.



The Coalition has provided over $6 million to vocational education and  training infrastructure for Indigenous Australians in the Northern  Territory since 2001.

(ix)  Education



The Coalition Government has committed extra funding and places for  Charles Darwin University.

It will receive:

205 new university places next year, rising to 561 by 2008,  including in areas such as nursing, teaching, tourism and  hospitality, business and engineering;

$4.6 million in additional funding this year to support the  provision of higher education in the region;

27 new Commonwealth Learning Scholarships for its low-income, Indigenous and rural and regional students with their  education and accommodation costs, valued at $72,000;

additional funding for its teaching and nursing places.



(x) Regional Partnerships and Related Programmes

The Coalition has provided about $10 million to the Northern Territory  under regional programmes since 1996.

Examples of the projects funded include:

$250,000 to the Uniting Church in Australia Property Trust (NT)  to support the construction of a community facility and museum  to provide a community space for community and school group  activities

Supporting the Territory 17

Ã¢ÂÂ¢

Ã¢ÂÂ¢

Ã¢ÂÂ¢

$289,620 to the Alice Springs Town Council to revitalise the  Snow Kenna Reserve which is a central focal point for many  social, cultural and environment community-based activities.



(xi)  Cultural  Heritage



The Cultural Heritage Projects Programme is providing $466,200 to the  Northern Territry for 5 Cultural Heritage projects including the  conservation of the East Point fortifications.

The fortifications have national significance for their association with  the Second World War, especially Japanese air attacks on Australia.   Works are a priority due to deterioration of sites.

(xii) Grants for Voluntary Environment and Heritage Organisations  (GVEHO) Programme

Environment Centres in the Northern Territory have received $824,704  in support under the GVEHO Programme.

The Environment Centres have played a crucial role in achieving  environmental protection and management throughout the Territory.

two Aboriginal communities, Elcho Isand and Maningrida, with a focus  on Groote Eylandt.

(xxi)  Resources



Sound economic management by the Coalition Government has  encouraged the growth of the Northern Territory resources sector.

The Northern Territory’s thriving resources sector is the lifeblood of its  many regional communities.

Every year the Northern Territory produces about half a billion dollars  of alumina, $340 million of gold, $218 million of zinc and more than  $1.5 billion of crude oil.

75 per cent of the value of the Northern Territory’s exports is from  mining.

The mining industry employs more than 3,500 people in the Territory -  sustaining many towns and businesses.

The Coalition Government has supported and continues to support the  development resources industries in the Northern Territory.

The Coalition Government’s Energy White Paper - Securing Australia’s  Energy Future - has established a comprehensive blueprint for  Australia's energy future.   The Energy White Paper announced significant initiatives for the  Australian industries and communities including:

$1.5 billion reduction in fuel excise costs to businesses and  households;

$500 million to leverage $1.5 billion in low emissions technology  investments,

over $200 million in direct assistance for the development and  commercialisation of renewable energy;

increased focus on the protection of critical infrastructure and  energy security (including biennial energy security reviews)

mandatory energy efficiency audits for the largest energy users.



The Energy White Paper also details the Australian Government's  adjustments to the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax (PRRT) to improve  the incentive for petroleum exploration in Australia’s remote offshore  areas.  The Coalition Government has taken, and will continue to take, a  national leadership role to pro-actively encourage investments to  develop Australia’s gas resource projects.  The Coalition Government continues to actively promote the Australian  LNG sector with both the US and other potential markets.

Recent arrangements with China, with sales worth up to $30 billion  over 25 years, have proven the Coalition Government's credentials in  facilitating significant gas supply arrangements.  The Coalition Government is continuing discussions with the  Government of East Timor on important issues which will help progress  the development of the Sunrise gas field.

Instead of supporting Invest Australia, Labor plans to scrap the very  agency that has successfully attracted international investment to  Australia.  By doing this, Labor leaves Australia without representation  in twelve of the world’s major economies, including New York, Paris  and Beijing.  Labor’s promise will restrict Australia’s ability to attract  world-class investment and projects.
