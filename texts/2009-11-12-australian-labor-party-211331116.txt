STEPHEN SMITH: Thanks very much for turning up. Today is of course the second day of  Trade Ministers and Foreign Ministers meeting in APEC, and Finance Ministers meet today  as well, and of course the Treasurer, Mr Swan is attending those meetings.

This of course is the 20th anniversary of the formation of APEC. APEC is the premier  economic  institution  in  the  Asia  Pacific.  Australia  is  very  proud  of  its  history  and  being  a   founding member and taking APEC to the premier position that it's in today.

And  both  Trade  Ministers  and  Finance  Ministers  are  discussing  further  economic   integration,  further  trade  liberalisation,  but  also  using  APEC  as  a  venue  or  a  forum  to   consolidate discussion about G-20 international financial matters.

So  far  as  Foreign  Ministers  are  concerned,  we've  of  course  been  having  our  own   conversations  about  these  matters  but  also  discussing  what  we  describe  as  the  regional   architecture.

This  is  the  century  of  the  Asia  Pacific  with  economic,  political,  strategic  influence   moving  to  our  part  of  the  world.  And  that's  as  a  result  of  the  ongoing  importance  of  the   United  States,  the  rise  of  China,  the  rise  of  India,  the  rise  of  the  ASEAN  economies   combined. And so are the institutions we have for our region suitable for that purpose.

There's  been  a  good  discussion  about  the  Prime  Minister's  Asia  Pacific  community   initiative.  We've  also  had  discussion  about  Japanese  Prime  Minister  Hatoyama's  suggestion   for an East Asia community. But we are now seeing, I think, a good discussion about where  the future institutions in our region should end up. That will of course take time.  When we  launched  our  Asia  Pacific  community  initiative  we  spoke  in  terms  of  a  timetable  2020  or   2025.

I think it's also the case that the consolidation of the G-20 as the premier international  institution dealing with financial matters has also  caused  us  to  have  a  discussion  about  that   interrelationship. We of course have got over 20 economies in APEC, nearly half of APEC's  members  are  in  the  G-20,  nine  of  them  including  Australia  and  Indonesia,  China,  Japan,   Korea, United States, and the like.

So we're having these discussions, it's a good thing and it augers well for the future of  APEC,  but  augers  well  for  Australia's  role  in  the  most  significant  economic  international   institution that we find in our region.

I'm happy to respond to that or other issues of the day.

QUESTION:  How  confident  are  you  that  the  asylum seekers  on  board  the  Oceanic  Viking  will take up your latest offer?

STEPHEN SMITH: We continue to be in conversation with them - the people on the boat -  through our officials. We also continue to be in conversation with Indonesian officials, and  we continue to work patiently towards our objective  which  is  to  see the people on the boat  peacefully and calmly and cooperatively come off the boat to enable processing to occur by  the UNHCR, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.

I've had discussions here with my Indonesian counterpart, Marty Natalegawa.  I may  well speak to him again later today. But the important discussions continue on the boat and  we, as the Prime Minister has said, as I have said, as Immigration Minister Chris Evans has  said, we remain patient and we're working methodically at it.

QUESTION:  Given  that  most  of  the  asylum  seekers  appear  likely  to  end  up  in  Australia,   wouldn't  it  have  been  easier  to  draw  a  line  under  this  earlier  and  simply  bring  them  to   Australia in the first place?

STEPHEN SMITH: I wouldn't just leap to that assumption. Let's go back to the start of this  matter which was a search and rescue operation at Indonesia's request in Indonesia's search  and rescue territory.

Indonesia wasn't in a position to assist, they asked us to assist, we did, as we should  have  and  as  we  would  do  again.  And,  as  a  result  of  discussions  between  Australian  and   Indonesian officials in the search and rescue area, and as a result of discussions subsequent  between  the  Prime  Minister  and  President  Yudhoyono,  it  was  agreed  that  they  be  taken  to   Indonesia, and we want to complete the search and rescue task. That's the first thing.

It's also clear that the people on board the boat who are from Sri Lanka want to claim  asylum.  Some  of  them  have  already  been,  on  my  advice,  already  been  assessed  by  the   UNHCR as mandated refugees, and others remain to fall for consideration by the UNHCR in  Indonesia.

Australia and Indonesia and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and  other countries - New Zealand, Canada, United States, some European countries - for some  time,  for  a  number  of  years  have  been  part  of  a  resettlement  program  so  far  as  refugees  in   Indonesia are concerned.

So, looking down the track, if these people on the boat who have, either already been  accorded refugee status, or others who are accorded refugee status, they will be resettled in  accordance with that agreement.

As Senator Evans has made clear, if you look at the statistics over the years Australia  has taken many of those, if not the majority, and we expect that that will continue. But they  will be resettled in accordance with those understandings with the UNHCR.

It  was  not  appropriate,  as  a  result  of  a  search  and  rescue  operation  in  Indonesian   territorial waters, to take the people to Christmas Island. That's why we agreed with Indonesia  to go to Indonesia, and we are working calmly and patiently and systematically to finish the  search and rescue operation.

QUESTION:  How  long  will  the  Oceanic  Viking  be  allowed  to  stay  in  Indonesian  waters   beyond this Friday?

STEPHEN SMITH: I've made the point often in recent times that the basis of the agreement  between Australia and Indonesia is as expressed by Foreign Minister Natalegawa and by me a  couple of weeks ago.

Indonesia has an abundance of patience in this matter, as does Australia.

There is a requirement on a regular basis for the Oceanic Viking to obtain diplomatic  clearance.  We  have  regarded  that,  and  it  is  being  treated  as,  effectively  an  administrative   matter. It's rolled over on a regular basis. It will be rolled over again at the end of this week.  So I've seen some people seek to suggest that somehow it’s a timetable or a deadline or an  issue.  It's  not.  That  will  be  done  in  a  normal,  routine,  regular  way  and  Foreign  Minister   Natalegawa and I are proceeding on the basis that we will be there for as long as it takes to  achieve  the  object,  which  is  to  persuade  the  people  on  the  boat  to  come  off  the  boat,   cooperatively, and in a civilised and dignified and peaceful way.

QUESTION:  And  where  are  you  at  in  terms  of  establishing  a  wider  framework  with   Indonesia?

STEPHEN SMITH: Those discussions have been ongoing. It's a good question,  because it  is  important  to  make  the  point  that  whilst  we  have  the  particular  special,  if  not  unique,   circumstances  of  the  Oceanic  Viking,  we  continue  to  work  with  Indonesia  on  our  general   cooperation so far as combating people smuggling is concerned.

That  occurs  under  the  overall  framework  of  the  Bali  Process.  But  our  officials  have   been  discussing  additional  framework  structures  under  the  Bali  Process.  I  said  to  the   Parliament, the last week that the Parliament met, that we were hopeful that officials would  be in a position to report progress on the work on the framework to Prime Minister Rudd and  President Yudhoyono when they met in the margins of APEC. We expect that that will occur  in  the  course  of  this  weekend,  but  I  also  expect  that  that  will  be  a  progress  report  not  a   finalised document, or a finalised framework.

But  they  have  been  -  our  officials  and  Indonesian  officials  -  have  been  making   progress.   And  we  will,  in  due  course,  conclude  that  framework  agreement  under  the  Bali   Process which will further reinforce the continuing good cooperation between Australia and  Indonesia  on  these  matters,  and  that  is  done,  effectively,  through  the  Bali  Process  which   Australia and Indonesia co-chair.

QUESTION: Minister, can I just ask about APEC and WTO and the Doha talks. There a lot  of  scepticism  about  any  conclusion  being  reached  on  the  Doha  Round.  Do  you  share  that   scepticism, and if that's the case what does this mean for APEC's own free trade agreement,  the FTAAP?

STEPHEN SMITH: I don't share the scepticism of the Doha Round. Australia very strongly  believes, and Simon Crean has been reinforcing and underlining this point not just this week,  but continually, indeed, since the collapse of the Doha Round talks at this - at about this time  last year.

We continue to very strongly believe that a successful conclusion to the Doha Round  is  important  to  the  international  economy,  is  important  to  our  region,  is  important  to   Australia, and we will continue to pursue those efforts.

APEC has a very important role to play in reinforcing that importance. And, as I say,  at about this time last year, indeed, the week before APEC met last year in Peru, in Lima, the  Doha Round collapsed. We then saw in APEC the following week a very strong communiquÃÂ©  about  the  importance  of  resuscitating  those  talks,  the  importance  of  completing  the   agreement.  But  also  we  saw  an  important  regional  trade  initiative  which  was  the  P4,  now   called  the  Trans  Pacific  Partnership,  which  sees  additional  countries  interested  in  that   regional trade agreement.

So,  I'm  expecting  a  very  strong  communiquÃÂ©  from  leaders  so  far  as  openness  of   markets  and  trade  is  concerned,  underlying  and  reinforcing  Australia's  and  APEC's  strong   view of the importance of successfully completing that Round.

I'm  not  proposing  to  put  a  timetable  on  it,  but  Simon  Crean  continues  to  work  very   assiduously with his colleagues on that matter.

QUESTION: Do you think more US leadership is needed [inaudible]?

STEPHEN SMITH: The United States has been intricately engaged in discussions on Doha  from day one and their involvement will continue.

It  enables  me  to  make  an  important  point,  which  we  very  strongly  believe,  that  the   United  States'  ongoing  engagement  in  the  Asia-Pacific  is  absolutely  essential.  And  we've



6

welcomed very much, and I again put it on the public record, how much we strongly support  President  Obama  and  Secretary  of  State  Clinton's  undertakings  and  actions  to,  not  just   consolidate, but to enhance United States engagement in our region.

The  President  is  about  to  embark  upon  a  trip  to  Japan  and  then  to  Singapore  for   APEC, and then to China and Korea. That's a very good thing. We welcome it.

Secretary of State Clinton, who I spoke with yesterday on a number of occasions, has  been  very  assiduous  in  her  visits  to,  and  consultations  with,  the  region,  including  APEC,   including  the  ASEAN  Regional  Forum.  So,  ongoing  and  enhanced  engagement  is  very   welcome and very important.

QUESTION:  There  are  reports  around  this  morning  that  Australia  has  offered  Sri  Lanka   more places for Sri Lankans to come to Australia legally in a bid to halt the influx of boats.  Has that offer been made to Sri Lanka?

STEPHEN  SMITH:  We've  had  discussions,  but  I  would  not  put  it  as  an  offer.  I'm  very   happy  just  to  quickly  go  through  my  discussions  in  Sri  Lanka  with  Foreign  Minister   Bogollagama, but also with President Rajapaksa.

They really fell into three categories. One was, of course, the need to combat people  smuggling  and  the  criminal  syndicates  who  run  that  out  of  Sri  Lanka.  We've  signed  a   Memorandum of Understanding for enhanced legal cooperation on that front, assistance and  capacity  building  on  prosecutions,  and  better  and  greater  cooperation  and  exchange  of   information on disruption, and the like. So, that's a good thing.  And the cooperation to date  has been good, but it will be enhanced.

Secondly, Sri Lanka has come through a terrible conflict, a civil war that's effectively  lasted  for  25  years.  That  conflict  is  now  over,  but  we  now  need,  in  Australia's  very  strong   view, to try and help Sri Lanka win the peace. I've made the point on a number of occasions  to Foreign Minister Bogollagama, to President Rajapaksa, both previously and in Sri Lanka  on Monday, that the challenge now for Sri Lanka is to win the peace.

Two things need to occur. We need to see the people in the displaced people's camps  resettled as quickly as possible. We welcome very much the fact that large numbers of people  have  been  resettled  in  recent  times.  We  welcome  very  much  the  fact  that,  in  recent  times,



7

there's  been  very  much  improved  access  by  the  international  institutions  and  agencies  and   international  NGOs.  And  our  special  representative,  John  McCarthy,  is  as  we  speak,  in  the   north in one of the displaced people's camps.

So,  we  have  given  in  the  past,  assistance,  and  I  announced  on  Monday  enhanced   assistance for basic things required to assist resettlement. Money for de-mining - a lot of the  community areas where people need to return to are littered with landmines, so we're putting  a substantial effort into that. Community housing, $3 million to United Nations-HABITAT to  help with the repair or rebuilding of housing. And also through the World Food Programme,  $2 million for food assistance to the people who are resettled but who can't put themselves in  a position of subsistence farming or growing crops.

And we are open to do more. I had a discussion yesterday with Bob Zoellick from the  World  Bank  about  how  Australia  can  potentially  be  of  assistance  to  the  World  Bank's   reconstruction  project  in  north  Sri  Lanka,  and  the  same  applies  to  the  Asian  Development   Bank, which also has a reconstruction project. So we have to help on the resettlement.

In addition to that - that is very much a short term matter - to win the peace, Sri Lanka  has to effect a political reconciliation. It has to move on matters of devolution, it has to make  all Sri Lankans feel as though they have a role in the country's future, a peaceful future. And  Sri Lanka will be judged by the international community on those two matters.

The third area I had a conversation with Foreign Minister Bogollagama and President  Rajapaksa  about,  was  whether  it  might  be  possible  for  us  to  see  whether,  as  part  of  our   ordinary  annual  migration  program,  we  might  be  able  to  look  at  additional  entrants  to   Australia from Sri Lanka to offset the attractions of the people smugglers; whether we could  craft a program which would be of incentive to people who might otherwise, or of attraction  to  people  who  might  otherwise  be  attracted  to  putting  themselves  in  the  hands  of  people   smugglers.

That  was  the  basis  of  conversation. Our  immigration  officials  will  now look  at  that.   But I certainly wouldn't categorise it as an offer. It's a discussion that I had, and I was very  pleased to have it, and will pursue it. And if we can find a program which will undercut the  attractions of the people smugglers to vulnerable people, then we'll move forward. But we'll  certainly let that be known at the time.

QUESTION: Minister, just a quick question on China. Do you think there's enough ballast  in the relationship between Australia and China to prevent a rift happening again like we've  seen recently with the Rio…

STEPHEN SMITH: A couple of things: I made a speech on China a couple of weeks ago  and that reflects our comprehensive view. We welcomed very much the visit of Vice Premier  Li, that was very successful and we welcomed his remarks.

I  think  both  Australia  and  China  understand  that  from  time  to  time  we  will  have   differences over particular matters. But the complementarity of the economic relationship, the  strength of the relationship, is such that we have and can and will work through these issues,  and we take a long-term patient view of our relationship with China.

I'll  be  meeting  with  Foreign  Minister  Yang  later  today,  as  we  invariably  do  in  the   margins of APEC or ASEAN. It will be good to catch up with him.

But we have to take, as I said in my remarks a week or so ago, not a starry-eyed view  of our relationship with China but a clear-eyed view of our relationship with China. We have  different systems, different values and, as a consequence of that, from time to time on matters  like Rebiya Kadeer, differences will arise and we understand and accept those differences and  work our way through them.

QUESTION: What's the latest on the Stern Hu case? I see that you'll be bringing that up on  the sidelines of this APEC meeting.

STEPHEN  SMITH:  That  will  fall  for  discussion  with  Foreign  Minister  Yang  later  in  the   day.

Our  officials  had  their  most  recent  consular  visit  to  Stern  Hu  a  few  days  ago.  From   memory,  the  ninth  of  this  month,  but  a  few  days  ago.  That's  part  of  our  regular  consular   access. The next consular visit will be in early to mid-December.

We were advised, our officials were advised, at that visit, or informed at that visit, that  the  Chinese  authorities,  in  accordance  with  Chinese  law,  have  extended  the  investigation   period for a further two months. So that will take the investigation period, as I understand it,  to early to mid-January. That's been done in accordance with Chinese law. And we continue



9

to say to Chinese authorities, as I will to Foreign Minister Yang, that whilst we understand  that  this  matter  is  being  progressed  in  accordance  with  Chinese  law,  we  do  think  it's  in   everyone's interest for the matter to be expedited and resolved as quickly as possible.

QUESTION: And is his family being constantly updated by the Government on these latest  developments?

STEPHEN SMITH: Well, whenever we have a consular visit we inform both his next of kin  - his family - and also his employer. And all of the advice that I have received are that he is in  a good state of health and in a good demeanour for a person who is in detention.

But  we,  whenever  we  have  our  consular  visit,  our  officials  ensure  as  quickly  as   possible that his family and his employer are informed as to his welfare.

QUESTION:  Can  we  get  a  just  quick  comment  on  Burma.  Hillary  Clinton  yesterday  was   saying that she wants the region to work towards… or help the military regime work towards,  a democracy and obviously free Aung San Suu Kyi from house arrest. What's happening from  Australia's end?

STEPHEN SMITH: We had a very good meeting in the margins of the General Assembly,  the so-called Secretary General's  Friends  of  Burma  group,  of  which Australia is a founding  member.  And  whilst  there  are  graduations  of  views  around  the  table,  I  think  people  have   come to a consensus view that we need to do more to try and encourage the regime back to a  democracy, to have a better environment for an election.

Of  course  Australia's  longstanding  position  is  that  Aung  San  Suu  Kyi  and  other   political prisoners should be released, there should be respect for the rule of law and return to  democracy. But no-one is suggesting that that is going to occur overnight.

I  had  a  good  conversation  with  Kurt  Campbell,  the  Assistant  Secretary  of  State,  on   these matters - he has the day to day running of it - and we've agreed that we'll catch up in the  next couple of weeks and have a more extensive conversation.

But we are very supportive of the United States in their efforts to bring about change  in Burma. But we have also - and this is the point that Secretary of State Clinton has made -



10

we've also been working very closely with our ASEAN colleagues and partners in trying to  bring about the same conclusion.

So, a good conversation with Kurt Campbell, and I expect to have a more extensive  conversation in the next couple of weeks.

QUESTION:  Overnight,  Rangoon  dismissed  Mrs  Clinton's  comments  as,  I  think,  colonial   meddling. It's going to be an uphill battle?

STEPHEN  SMITH:  It's  going  to  be  a  long  conversation  which  will  require  assiduous   attention  to  Burma,  not  just  by  the  United  States,  not  just  by  Australia,  but  by  the  region,   including ASEAN, East Asia Summit, and ASEAN Regional Forum.

No-one  is  expecting  that  change  will  occur  overnight,  but  it  is  in  our  view  that  the   winds of change are starting to blow. But no-one is asserting that things will occur overnight  or quickly.
