SENATOR FOR NEW SOUTH WALES





NSW AUSTRALIAN OF THE YEAR



Deputy Labor Leader in the Senate and Senator for New South Wales Kristina  Keneally congratulates the 2020 NSW Australian of the Year - Orthopaedic  surgeon and human-rights advocate Professor Munjed Al Muderis.

In 1999, Professor Al Muderis fled from persecution in Iraq after he refused to  surgically remove the ears of soldiers who had escaped from the army under  Saddam Hussein's regime.

Professor Al Muderis arrived in Australia by boat before being granted refugee  status and permanent residence by the Howard Government.

Since then, the orthopaedic surgeon has become a leader in the field of  osseointegration which involves attaching prosthetic, robotic limbs to the bones  of amputees. He originally became fascinated by the concept of cybernetic  limbs at the age of 12 when he watched The Terminator.

“Professor Al Muderis’ bravery and commitment - to New South Wales,  Australia and his fellow woman and man - is profound,” said Senator Keneally.

“From refusing the orders of Saddam Hussein’s totalitarian regime, to fleeing to  Australia, to saving the limbs and lives of people in his new found home,  Professor Al Muderis is the embodiment of someone who has not only had a go,  but has given a go to so many other Australians.”

Ali France, Labor’s 2019 Candidate for the seat of Dickson, was Professor  Munjed Al Muderis’ 26th osseointegration patient in Australia after a tragic  accident saw her left leg amputated above the knee. Mr Al Muderis pioneered  the ground breaking new osseointegration surgery in Australia.



“To see my surgeon honoured as the NSW Australian of the Year is especially  moving for me because without him I would not walking,” said Ms France.

“Since arriving in Australia, he has devoted his life’s work to helping others and  has improved the lives of hundreds of amputees like me. Not a day goes by that  I am not grateful he is here.”

The Australian of the Year will be selected by the National Australia Day Council  Board and awarded in Canberra on Australia Day Eve 2020.
