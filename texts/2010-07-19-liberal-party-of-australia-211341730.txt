E&OE……………………….…………………………………………………………………

LISA WILKINSON:

Tony Abbott, good morning to you.

TONY ABBOTT:

Good morning to you too, Lisa.

LISA WILKINSON:

You must be heartened by at least some of those numbers, but we’re hearing this morning that leader of the  Greens, Bob Brown, has done a preference deal with Labor. So at this stage, how do you rate your chances?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, Lisa, it’s going to be tough. It’s always tough to beat a first term government, but I’m looking at the  field evidence and for three years we’ve had a government which has been more talk than action and the last  three weeks of the Government under Julia Gillard has been the most chaotic and shambolic of all. So, I  think it’s all there and I’ll be working very hard until polling day.

LISA WILKINSON:

Well, you’re in the numbers game, so let’s have a look at some more of those numbers. Some that aren’t so  favourable for you this morning is when it comes to understand family concerns. The Nine News/Galaxy  Poll says that significantly more Australians believe Julia Gillard understands families better than you do.  Now, as a long time married father of three, how do you account for that?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, I’m not going to try to work out what’s going through those polls.  I’m just, as I said, working hard. I  understand cost of living pressures, I have a mortgage, a high mortgage, I face grocery bills that are going  up, despite Labor’s promises. Just like everyone else, Lisa, my electricity prices have gone up 35 per cent

since Labor came to office. They’ll go up more, if Labor’s carbon tax becomes a reality, as it will if they win  the election. So look, I’m wrestling with these things, just like everyday Australians.

LISA WILKINSON:

Tony Abbott, you’ve made clear your disgust at the way Kevin Rudd was deposed from office and voters  seem to agree with you. That Galaxy Poll once again, that says that 62 per cent want Julia Gillard to give  Kevin Rudd, the man that she toppled, his first choice of Cabinet post and it looks like she’s set to honour  that. Will you, in turn, give Malcolm Turnbull, the man that you toppled, his first choice of frontbench roles  Cabinet?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I’ve said that he would have a senior role. But the interesting thing is, who will be the Foreign  Minister in a Gillard Government if she’s re-elected? Who will be the Finance Minister? Who will be the  Defence Minister? She’s losing her two most competent ministers and if you want stability and certainty in  the Australian Government, you certainly wouldn’t get it by re-electing the Gillard Government, or the  Rudd/Gillard Government.

LISA WILKINSON:

So does that mean Malcolm Turnbull won’t get his first choice or he will?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, he will have a senior role.  But as I said, you say, Lisa, Julia Gillard is going to give Kevin Rudd the  foreign ministry. I don’t know that Stephen Smith has agreed to that and perhaps he should be asked exactly  what arrangements have been entered into.

LISA WILKINSON:

Alright, well, the PM is driving hard the message that her government will ‘move Australia forward’.  You’re saying that the nation deserves more than these endless repeatedly mindless glib phrases. Tony  Abbott, can I suggest that if anyone of us had a dollar for every time you’ve talked about the government’s  big new tax in the last three months, we could have paid the mining tax ourselves by now.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, Lisa, let me say something else. If you elect a Coalition Government, Australia will be changed for the  better. We’ll end the waste, we’ll repay the debt, we will stop the big new taxes, and we’ll stop the boats.

LISA WILKINSON:

Alright, well, just moving on, on the weekend you declared WorkChoices was ‘dead, buried, cremated’,  quote, unquote. But you also said when pushed that it’s only off the agenda for the next three years which  would indicate that WorkChoices is not dead at all. People could be forgiven for thinking that, like Lazarus  with a triple bypass, WorkChoices has a very good chance of rising again under your ongoing leadership?

TONY ABBOTT:

But if we aren’t going to change the legislation, we can’t bring back WorkChoices, as simple as that.

LISA WILKINSON:

So, you wouldn’t bring it back? If you were elected at this next election and you move into the next election,  is there any chance that you would bring WorkChoices back? You’ve only said that it’s dead for three years,  that’s one term?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, Lisa, I have an election to win.  It’s the 2010 Election and as I said, WorkChoices is dead, it’s buried  and it’s cremated. If I win this election, I will not change the legislation. I can hardly be stronger than that.

LISA WILKINSON:

So you won’t change it at this point. Ok, you mention there the boats. A report this morning is showing that  this year will be a record year for asylum seeker arrivals, as many as 7,000 are expected by year’s end. One  of your key election promises, we saw on the ads last night, that you will turn the boats around. But as a  wife of one naval officer put it to you last week, that often means self-sabotage on the boats on the water,  which puts our naval personnel in very dangerous circumstances. How do you propose to turn boats around  when they’re loaded with dozens, sometimes hundreds of desperate people?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, the same way that Julia Gillard proposed to do it when she was the Shadow Minister for Immigration.  The same way that it was done under the former government. On seven occasions, boats were turned around.  That was very effective in helping to stop the flow of boats.

LISA WILKINSON:

All right, Tony Abbott, we’ll have to leave it there. We wish you well on the campaign trail and no doubt  we’ll speak again soon. Thanks for your time this morning.

TONY ABBOTT:

Thank you, Lisa.
