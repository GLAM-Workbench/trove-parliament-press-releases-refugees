Kerry Nettle, Senator for New South Wales



Senator Nettle meets with long-term Baxter detainees

22nd Mar 05

Greens Senator Kerry Nettle visited Baxter Immigration Detention  Centre today, visiting long term detainees.  The visit coincides with a Federal Cabinet meeting which is  considering the fate of long term detainees in Australia.  "Today I meet with ten people in Baxter detention centre, most of  whom have been in detention for over four years, including Peter  Qasim who has been detained for seven years", Senator Nettle said.  "They asked me to give this message to the government:  "The time has come for some compassion. The point the  government tried to make on border protection four-years ago has  been made"  "The detainees are apprehensive about the Cabinet decision."  "There is a lot of fear that they will be left to languish for more  years behind the wire."  "It is time for the government to give these people their freedom.  Most of them have skills that could be used in the community; two  of the detainees we met with have had job offers."  "They should be released and given permanent protection; no one  should be left in this limbo for years on end."  The Greens want to see an end to mandatory detention and for  asylum seekers to be able to live in the community while their  claims are assessed.  Contact - Jon Edwards 0428 213 146
