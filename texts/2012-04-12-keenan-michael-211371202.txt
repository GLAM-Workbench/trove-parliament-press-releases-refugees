Michael Keenan MP - Federal Member for  Stirling 2UE Interview with Mike Jeffreys April 12, 2012

Topics: Labor’s Border Protection failure / Latest Illegal Boat Arrival

Mike Jeffreys

To continue this conversation Michael Keenan, Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and Border Protection. Michael  good evening, thank you for your time.

Michael Keenan

Good evening Mike, nice to be with you again.

Mike Jeffreys

The number of asylum seekers just keeps rising, I mean what’s the plan here that we eventually come to accept that it is a  part of life and just shrug our shoulders and don’t do anything about it and the open border crowd have completely won?

Michael Keenan

Well I couldn’t possibly tell you what Labor’s plan is because they do just seem to want to bury their heads in the sand and  ignore the issue. 255 people arriving on these two illegal boats is the largest number of people to ever arrive under the  Labor Government in 24 hours and yet they don’t seem to want to do anything to address this issue even though there is  a clear pattern of more people arriving on larger vessels. Of course that is the direct response of their let them out policy  which is exactly what the Government now does, when people arrive here they just let them out into the community and  clearly that is an enormous encouragement for people smugglers who are able to go out into the world and use that as a  great selling point to sell their product of illegal entrance into Australia.

Mike Jeffreys

The open borders crowd really are winning the day aren’t they?

Michael Keenan

They are under the Labor Party and sadly this is not going to change until there is a change in Government. Labor has  been given every opportunity to address this issue and we have given them every opportunity to address this issue and  we would work with them if they were going to implement policies that were actually going to be effective in stopping  people smuggling. They don’t show any likelihood that they are going to do that and sadly it is going to take an election  and a change in government before Australia regains some control over our own immigration system.

Mike Jeffreys

There is this sophistry presented that the numbers aren’t very big but I had Greg Sheridan, who writes on foreign affairs  for The Australian, on this program a couple of weeks ago and I have had so much response  to that conversation. He  really laid it out unemotionally, so cogently, the fact of the matter is with family reunion we could be looking at 65,000  uninvited and at this rate maybe 100,000. These are all people who aren’t planned for. They are going to big cities like  Sydney where the infrastructure is bursting at the seams. We will have social problems as a result of this and when it  comes to a further piece of sophistry of Australia should be more generous, don’t we accept people who arrive here to our  north at a rate of about 2-1 compared to comparable individuals in the United Kingdom? We are really being so very  generous, as you say you don’t have to stay in detention for more than 90 days, basically you just come here and you are

out walking around again. It really is simply trouble brewing isn’t it?

Michael Keenan

I think there are enormous challenges associated with it. I certainly reject any idea that this isn’t an enormous policy  problem I mean you only need to look at the cost alone to the Australian tax payer which is almost $4 billion and rising.  You are right that there have been about 16,500 people arrive but then there is family reunion after that. This is an  enormous policy problem and I can’t understand why the Labor Party just refuses to deal with it. If something isn’t done  then clearly there will be enormous consequences and the Immigration Department actually laid that out saying that if  people are going to arrive at this rate then it was going to result in some social dislocation in Australia. I think when we are  not in charge over who is coming through our immigration system it does tend to undermine everybody’s confidence in the  whole immigration system. I am always very concerned that when people arrive here illegally then people have a look and  they make judgements about the integrity of the whole immigration system which I don’t think is particularly helpful for  anyone.

Mike Jeffreys

I think it is disruptive and I think it is unfair that all the focus is on the people who have enough money to pay the people  smugglers after having already paid to fly to a jumping off point. There is no focus on the poor devils who are staring out  from behind the chain link wire. They don’t seem to get any attention at all. You are right that this country had such a

successful immigration program, we were an example to the world and now it is just being viewed as scant to put it mildly  isn’t it?

Michael Keenan

Australians rightly expect that the Australian Government to control our immigration program. What’s happening now is  that a sizeable chunk of that immigration program is literally being controlled by criminal gangs. They are the ones who  are deciding who comes to Australia and they are making enormous sums of money out of doing so. These 255 people  who arrived in the last 24 hours if they paid about $10,000 a head then that’s $2.5 million that the people smugglers have  made in one day alone. This is not the way for a country to run an immigration system. We need to be in charge over who  is coming here and when we lose that right to choose who is coming to Australia then I think that all Australians lose  confidence in the immigration system as a whole. Immigration is one of the great success stories of Australia as a country.

Mike Jeffreys

Well it has been.

Michael Keenan

That’s exactly right and I wouldn’t like to see people make judgements about the whole immigration program based on  their dislike and disgust at the fact that we have these people smugglers who are now in charge over who is coming to  Australia.

Mike Jeffreys

That’s it. I think you have summed it up there. Our immigration program to a large extent is being run by criminals.

Michael Keenan

I don’t know how any Government could really accept that. One of the most important things that the Commonwealth does  is protect our borders and Australians really do expect their Government to do that effectively yet the response from Julia  Gillard and the Labor Party is literally to shrug their shoulders, bury their heads in the sand and hope that this problem  goes away. But the more you ignore it the worst it gets because the more successful people are in getting here illegally  the more they encourage others to come in their wake and that is what’s happening now, that is why we are seeing the  rate of illegal arrivals accelerate. We have had almost double the rate of people coming here illegally this year then we  had at the same time last year so clearly things are getting worse.

Mike Jeffreys

So what’s going to happen? Nothing until there is a change of Government? Have you speculated over the possibility of  the Labor Party changing leaders and then jettisoning the hold the Greens have over them at least coming up to the next  election and dumping some of the things that are making them so on the nose with the electorate including the fact that  they can’t control the borders or don’t want to?

Michael Keenan

I suppose that remains a possibility, the Labor Party might change leaders. I am not sure what effect that might have on  their policies as certainly they seem committed to the failed policies that have brought us to this pretty ordinary place now.  I don’t know whether a change in leadership might herald a change in policy. I would hope so quite frankly because this is

very bad for our country and I would like to see it change but there is just absolutely no indication that anyone in the Labor  Party thinks that it needs to change. First of all you need to decide that it needs to change and then you need to have an  enormous resolve to pursue the policies that are required because they are tough to actually beat people smuggling. I  don’t see anyone on the Labor Party frontbench or any of their potential leaders talking about that as a possibility.

Mike Jeffreys

The social fallout and the suspicion will continue for years no matter what happens. I think you pretty much nailed it, the  whole thing is out of control except for as far as the people smugglers are concerned who are making big bucks with very  low overheads putting people into very risky situations because the promise is once you are here, hey that’s it you have  made it.

Michael Keenan

Yeah that’s right and clearly once you are here the Government is just letting people out into community detention and  what a wonderful product if you are a people smuggler. You go out and sell that to the Middle East or wherever else you  are selling your product and say look give me $10,000 and I will smuggle you into Australia and then the Australian  Government will just let you out into the community. When you are selling that sort of product that is a pretty powerful  thing that you are selling and the Labor Party have sadly taken away literally every single part of the Howard  Government’s successful border protection policies, which has provided every encouragement for these criminal gangs  who will continue to bring people down here until someone does something about that.

Mike Jeffreys

I appreciate your time and comments Michael. Thank you for that.
