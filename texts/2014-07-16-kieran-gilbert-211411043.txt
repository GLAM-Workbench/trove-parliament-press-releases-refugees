E&OE TRANSCRIPT  RADIO INTERVIEW   SKYNEWS AM AGENDA  WEDNESDAY 16 JULY 2014

SUBJECT/S: Abbott Government’s Budget chaos, Senate chaos, Qantas,  Scott Morrison refusing to reveal details of Australian customs vessel

JOURNALIST - KIERAN GILBERT: With me on the program this morning the  Labor frontbencher Richard Marles, and also Liberal Minister Jamie Briggs,  gentlemen good morning to you all, I want to explore a couple of these things,  first of all Joe Hockey’s comments this morning Jamie Briggs saying essentially  that the Government will have to go around the Parliament if the bulk of the  Budget savings measures aren’t passed what does he mean by that?

JAMIE BRIGGS, ASSISTANT MINISTER FOR INFRASTRUCTURE AND  REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT: Well look I think there’s couple of points here,  firstly, as we saw yesterday, I think people need to be a bit calmer about their  analysis of what happens in the Senate, you know there’s been a lot of  excitement about the new Senate and what happened last week, but the reality  is this is not unusual for the history of the Senate, the Howard Government for  most of its time, had to work with the independents in the Senate, the  Democrats in those days, to work through legislation and changes, what we’re  seeing is exactly the same outcome now, the Howard Government didn’t often  get every one of its Budget measures through straight away it took some time  they worked with the Senate and eventually achieved the outcome that they  wanted and I think here we will do the same thing, it will be methodical, we’ll  work calmly, we’re not going to panic, we’re going to do exactly what we told  the electorate last September and that is to fix the Budget, the point the

Treasurer’s making this morning is that if the Labor party refuses to accept the  advice of the Australian people last September which was to let us fix the  Budget, then we will have to find other ways to ensure that we will live within  our means, it’s a very important principle.

GILBERT: What are the other options beyond, so aid was something, that was  the biggest savings measure in the Budget and that’s gone through as part of an  appropriations bill, what other revenue streams or spending streams are you  talking about?

BRIGGS: Well look I appreciate the faith that you have but I’m not the  Treasurer, Joe’s the Treasurer, and Mathias is the Finance Minister and they’re  the two Finance Ministers that will look at the budget, looks at the circumstances  which we find ourselves in, and come up with additional ways in order for us to  achieve what our aim is, but I think firstly let’s work through the Senate, through  the processes, as we saw yesterday, the assumption the Labor party made, all  their wrecking, all their attempts to try and stop us doing the job we’re elected  to do won’t necessarily work, I’m confident over the months ahead, we’ll work in  an adult fashion with the Senate, we’ll work through the changes that we need  to make, we’ll sit down with the relevant Senators, we’ll get those outcomes and  we’ll fix the Budget.

GILBERT: Well we’ve got the comment, I’ll come back to you Richard Marles in  a moment, I just want to play our viewers the comment made by Joe Hockey  this morning let’s have a listen: “The Senate chooses to block savings initiatives,  then we need to look at other savings initiatives that may not require legislation,  and I would ask the Greens and the Labor party who between them hold 35  votes on the floor of the Senate, to understand that there are alternatives  through Government, we are going to fix the Budget, that’s what we promised  the Australian people.” Mr Hockey this morning on the ABC, incidentally he’ll be  joining us on Sky news a bit later this morning as well and I’ll have more details  for you shortly, but Richard Marles in terms of well what Jamie Briggs has to say  about the Senate performance thus far, if you look at the things that have gone  to the Senate on the Budget, they’ve all gone through, the appropriation bills,  the debt levy, it’s all gone through thus far.

MARLES: Jamie’s done a really good job in trying to put a calm face on what is  a complete shambles and I think the idea of equating this to the experiences of  the Howard Government is completely ridiculous, the Howard Government were  never threatening to work around the Parliament in order to implement its  Budget, that’s what we’re talking about here, actually getting its Budget through,  the fact of the matter is the Budget is in total disarray and this was a  Government which said that it was not going to do deals with minor parties, that  is wasn’t going to . . .

BRIGGS: That’s not true.

MARLES: That’s absolutely what you said.

BRIGGS: Do deals to form Government that’s what we said, we don’t do deals  with the Greens to form Government that’s exactly true.

MARLES: Well the level of hysteria that we saw in the last term of Government  and when we look at what experiences they are now having when they are the  Government, we saw that unbelievable spectacle last night of the Finance  Minister turning up to the Senate and reading out a set of words which were  presumably part of the deal that he did with Clive Palmer, there’s no doubt  whose calling the shots here, it ain’t the Prime Minister it’s big Clive, I mean  Clive’s the one who’s running the joint.

GILBERT: You’ve got to get things through the Parliament, you’ve got to deal  with the cross bench, Palmer United has the balance of power.

MARLES: They do, but this is the issue that the Government has and it’s why  the calm that you’re seeing from Jamie now, is certainly not reflected in the way  the people in the ministerial wing are behaving right now, I mean there is broken  glass and panic buttons being pushed all over the joint as they try to work out  how they’re going to try to deal with this Senate, and right now this is a  Government which is not control and it is in complete disarray and the guy who  is the puppet master is Clive Palmer.

GILBERT: Is Clive Palmer carrying too much influence?

BRIGGS: Well look I think what’s interesting here is that the Labor party for six  years ran a shambolic and chaotic Government, when they had a majority in the  first term with Kevin Rudd they decided they didn’t like Kevin Rudd anymore and  they knifed him, they lived then in complete chaos with a hung Parliament, they  did a deal to form Government which is what the Prime Minister said we wouldn’t  do just to correct that fallacy that the Labor party is trying to create, they want  the chaos, the love the chaos, this is what Labor live for, the Labor MPs have  become so obsessed by the daily horse race call of politics, the obsession with  the 24 hour news cycle about what’s happening here or what’s happening there,  that’s just not how we’re going to govern, we’re going to put in place a plan, we  said last September four critical things to the Australian people, we said we’d  stop the boats Richard won’t talk about that because that’s what’s happening.

MARLES: We’ll talk about that ..

BRIGGS: We said we would get rid of the taxes, and hopefully today we’ll have  the carbon tax abolished, we said we would build the roads of the 21st century

and we’re getting on with that with a 50billion dollar investment, and we said  we’d fix the Budget and we will fix the Budget.

GILBERT: It was chaotic though, can you see it was chaotic last week? The  chaos of last week was untidy.

BRIGGS: The first week of a new Senate there was all sorts of new experiences  for a bunch of new Senators, for the Palmer United Senators obviously, but there  are other Senators as well there’s a Family First Senator there’s David  Leyonhjelm, we shouldn’t just pay attention to just one person necessarily, there  are a bunch of people in the Senate that we’ll continue to talk that we’ll continue  to work through, people like Nick Xenophon, people like John Madigan, we’ll  continue to work with those Independent Senators because the Labor party has  played themselves out of being a mature mainstream party in Australian politics  at the moment, they want chaos, they don’t know what they stand for, but we  do know at the next election the Australian people will have a choice, do they  want a Budget which is fixed, do they want the boats stopped or do they want  the boats started again?

GILBERT: Richard Marles you can respond to what Jamie Briggs has said there  but I want to also put to you a couple of other things that he referred to, one the  carbon tax the repeal likely today, the other thing is FOFA, the Future of  Financial Advice Laws, Mathias Cormann in my interview with him again just  after 9am but he’s saying that he got through the bulk of what they wanted, the  changes the amendment to Palmer was already in the legislation.

MARLES: In terms of the Budget, this was a Budget full of broken promises, this  was a Budget that no one expected in this country to be delivered by a  Government that said it wasn’t going to increase taxes, that said it wasn’t going  to affect health spending or education spending, it did all of that and so the only  thing that Labor has been doing in the positions that we have taken and in the  Senate is stand up for what was put to the Australian people last year and stand  up for the Australian people.

BRIGGS: Well the carbon tax we said we’d get rid of the carbon tax so…

MARLES: You said you would not touch health and education spending and  that’s what you’re going to do.

BRIGGS: We said we’d get rid of the carbon tax you won’t support that.

MARLES: You said that you were not going to increase taxes and now we’ve got  a GP tax in place, we’ve made it completely clear in relation to carbon pre 2007  that we support pricing carbon that we support an Emissions Trading Scheme,  the one thing actually throughout this whole debate pre 2007 is that you’ve had  total consistency from Labor about what we have sought to do…

BRIGGS: There will be no carbon tax under the Government I lead.

MARLES: No we have always stood for pricing carbon you used to stand for it,  when you were working for John Howard you stood for it, but you’ve flipped all  over the place.

BRIGGS: I wasn’t a Member of Parliament when I worked for John Howard.

MARLES: No but the Liberals stood for it back then, they’ve been flipping and  flopping all over the place on that issue, we’ve been entirely consistent and we  are now.

- BREAK -

GILBERT: Compromise on Qantas, it wasn’t exactly what the Government  wanted but do you think it will affect the change you want and get that foreign  investment you wanted or that the airline is after?

BRIGGS: Well it’s not what Qantas wanted, but in the end Labor had been  unwilling to move away from their ideological position that the Unions demand  that they hold and so that we believe that we need to do as much as we can for  Qantas and give them the best chance to compete in a very challenging  environment, I mean running an airline is a very difficult business it’s not easy  for Alan Joyce, it’s not easy for John Borghetti, but Qantas has got unfair  restrictions which hold it back from competing as well as it can, we know Qantas  if its free to compete will compete with any global competitor, it’s a terrific  airline, it services Australia very well but it needs capital injection to compete.

GILBERT: But is this the sort of compromise that the Government needs to  undertake more broadly, I guess you’ve done this now with the Labor party but  is this the sort of attitude you need to take more broadly when it comes to your  budget measures for example, because the Prime Minister keeps saying that he’s  confident that he’ll get his agenda through and repeats that but when you look  at the public statements from the cross bench and the other parties it doesn’t  look that promising.

BRIGGS: Well look I think the point I was making earlier is you need just to  have a series of conversations with the relevant people, we can’t have them with  Labor because they’ve just decided to be wreckers so you then need to engage  with the middle benches, you know the reality is that in the 1980s and the early  1990s is when Australia had major economic reform challenges led by Bob  Hawke and Paul Keating, they had in the Opposition at that important time,  largely support, largely support, sometimes complaint, but largely support, when  it came to the Parliament, what you’re finding now is that you’ve got a  mainstream political party that’s played itself out of the game, you know Richard  talks about election commitments, the number one election commitment

everyone knows was to abolish the carbon tax and the Labor party will just  refuse in the Senate, refuse in the Senate to do what the Australian people said  we should do, and what that says Kieran, is that at the next election, there will  be a very clear choice, that the coalition that will have a plan without a carbon  tax and a Labor party who will bring the carbon tax back that is what Labor will  do.

GILBERT: Richard you can respond to a couple of those things but I also want  to get your thoughts on this Qantas deal it is not what the airline wanted they  wanted entirely the Sale Act to go.

MARLES: Well I think the position we’ve held in relation to Qantas has been  consistent, I think Qantas put a range of options on the table, a number of which  were knocked back by the Government, but we have always said that Qantas  needs to be an Australian owned airline and those components of the Sale Act  which require it to have an Australian identity in terms of the composition of the  board the location of the head office, all of that mattered, now we have freed up  a number of the ownerships components of this and so that there is a greater  freedom to invest in Qantas and that’s going to be an important step forward but  we are glad that the Government has finally seen some sense on this and rolled  over in support on what we’ve been saying which is that Qantas is an Australian  icon and that it needs to remain in Australian hands, but I do want to pick up on  something that Jamie said in terms of a mature partner in the governing of this  country, there is nothing mainstream about the budget that was put up by this  Government, nothing mainstream at all, we don’t enjoy a mainstream  Government right now, that’s the fact of the matter, this is not the Howard  Government, this is not a normal Liberal Government, this is a Government  which put in place a budget which was out of the box in terms of the way in  which it was hurting ordinary Australians, and we have an obligation because  they voted for us too, to stand up for those Australians, and so we are going to  stand up in relation to the cutting of pensions

BRIGGS: We aren’t cutting pensions, stop telling fibs

MARLES: You are, your own Budget papers talk about it. We are going to stand  up for health spending we are going to stand up against the deregulation of the  university system which is going to send university fees through the roof, I mean  that is what this mob are doing and there is nothing mainstream about it.

GILBERT: You’re critical of Mathias Cormann for striking this deal with Clive  Palmer, you and Tony Burke this morning saying that he’s reading from his script  but can Labor really make that suggestion given your whole term in Government  in the last few years was dictated by a deal you did with the Greens.

MARLES: We managed a Parliament in far more difficult circumstances where  we were a minority Government where we put through a record amount of  legislation during that period of Government. There was a functioning Parliament  notwithstanding the fact that we were a minority Government, now what you’ve  got here is a Government which enjoys a significant majority in the House of  Representatives which has a Senate with cross benches which at one level Jamie  is right, the idea that the Government doesn’t control the Senate is of course a  circumstance that has persisted for most of the time since the mid-70s and yet  what you’ve got is a Government which has absolutely no idea or no ability about  how to work with that Senate.

BRIGGS: Well we just passed legislation yesterday.

MARLES: Your Budget is in disarray.

GILBERT: Should Mathias Cormann lead the negotiations then in the Senate he  told me this morning that Clive Palmer was very direct and cooperative, maybe  he should be leading the charge.

MARLES: He’s not leading he’s just doing what Clive says. Well that’s a way of  doing it, to be fair, he can just do what Clive says.

BRIGGS: How is your senior Shadow Minister Sarah Hansen-Young this  morning?

MARLES: It’s a nice try Jamie, nice try, but Clive is running the joint and that is  the simple fact here.

GILBERT: I want to ask you about the boat that you’ve made a fair deal of in  terms of the Government’s response that’s been now at sea for more than a  month, what’s the latest word on that, is there any advice that you’ve received  through the department.

MARLES: No and what we need to hear from the Government is exactly what is  their plan, I mean from what we know which is basically through the affidavit  that was provided to the High Court, is that there is an Australian customs vessel  somewhere out there in the Indian Ocean with 153 Tamil asylum seekers on  board, those asylum seekers as you say have been at sea now for more than a  month, they’ve been on board this boat for the better part of a couple of weeks,  but what on earth is the plan, and this is not an operational matter here, this  goes to the very heart of our compliance with the UN Refugee Convention, the  High Court has obviously got concerns in terms of looking at this issue around  the question of how people will be assessed and obviously that matter will be  taken through the High Court but what on earth is the plan for these people over  the next through weeks as we allow the process of the High Court to play out?

GILBERT: Jamie Briggs you’re not the Immigration Minister but your, any  thoughts on this issue, which of course Richard has carriage of in terms of the  Labor party.

BRIGGS: Sure well I think there’s a couple of points obviously Scott’s dealing  with the detail of it and it’s not appropriate for me to talk about the specifics of  this issue but we were very clear before the election, the Labor party and its  Coalition partner the Greens said that we couldn’t do what we were seeking to  do which was to stop the boats arriving to end the deaths at sea and we’ve  largely done that, we haven’t of course declared that the challenge is over, in  fact it probably never is, it will always be a challenge and it will always be a  threat to the next time Labor’s back in Government and their Coalition partners,  they’ll overturn the laws again and we’ll see the boats arrive again, that’s the  reality, Labor is driven by the Greens on this issue, they don’t have a mainstream  view of it, they don’t support the policies that we’ve put in place that have  stopped the boats from arriving in the first place, and this is a very clear choice,  again a very clear choice for the Australian people of how you govern, how you  ensure that we don’t have this issue dogging our politics constantly.

MARLES: The principal policy which is working here is the PNG arrangement  which Labor put in place which the Greens oppose, the Greens oppose.

GILBERT: We know the two sides view on that and we’re not going to resolve  that this morning.

BRIGGS: We know the evidence

GILBERT: I want to just finish up on a very much different and lighter note,  very light note, hopefully a very great note for Australia, who’s going to win the  British Open Golf? I know you both love that sport.

MARLES: Well Adam Scott, you know we can’t go past Adam Scott, I do think  I’ve got a soft spot for Marc Leishman who comes from Victoria’s south west,  knows how to play in the wind, I’m also a Tiger fan I’ve got to say, I’m really  excited about Tiger making his comeback in major tournaments.

GILBERT: What about you mate any thoughts?

BRIGGS: Well look I think obviously Australian golf has never been healthier,  we’ve got a bunch of just extraordinarily talented young guys representing  Australia in a really impressive way, I mean Adam Scott you wouldn’t get a more  impressive sportsman. And can I also say that Richard Porte in the Tour de  France has come in second and it’s extraordinary and hopefully he does well in  the rest of it.

GILBERT: Jamie Briggs Richard Marles thanks for being with us on sports line I  mean AM Agenda.
