PRIME MINISTER:

Well hi everyone. Tom, thank you, thank you so much for welcoming Michaelia and I here today.

Your company, founded by your dad in 1971, a family company. It is an example of the  businesses that are investing and employing and driving the big growth in jobs we’ve seen in  Australia in the last year. 403,000 across the country, 100,000 of them in Queensland. And one  of the reasons that's happening is because we have been reducing company tax for small and  medium businesses, including Tom's.

Tom, how important is the reduction in company tax to you, for your business?

MR TOM ECKERSLEY - MANAGING DIRECTOR, ECKERSLEY GROUP:

Incredibly. We have basically our future investment in technology is based on the earnings that  we keep within the business. So in a practical context, if we don't have that, I can't keep  investing.

If we don't have that, I can't keep investing in future technology.

PRIME MINISTER:

So this business started in '71, has been funded from retained earnings. So the more of the  profit that's made that you can retain and plough back into the business, the more you can grow  and the more you can hire?

MR TOM ECKERSLEY:

Absolutely. Without that, we can't keep investing in the business.

PRIME MINISTER:

Investment means jobs.

Now, the other policy of ours that is driving jobs right here - and Tom's got a great story to tell  about that - is our PaTH program. What that is doing is giving opportunities for young people  who’ve been struggling to get started in the workforce the opportunity to get an internship and  then go on to full-time work.

We've met Jarrod and John today. They're two young guys in their early 20s who are starting as  apprentices. So tell us Tom, how the PaTH program has enabled you to recruit two future stars  of the printing industry.

MR TOM ECKERSLEY:

Well, basically, two young men that really didn't have much of an insight into what the printing  industry was all about were exposed to our business through that PaTH program.

Both came in, worked within our environment for a period of time and liked what they saw and  liked the people that they were working with and we had an opportunity to test that from our  point of view as well. At the end of the day then the pathway forward then has led and resulted  in both of them starting apprenticeships with us recently.

PRIME MINISTER:

Great.

MR TOM ECKERSLEY:

So the engagement has been great and the guys are here and happy, you know, through the  workplace now.

PRIME MINISTER:

Fantastic and Michaelia, we've had these - PaTH programs started in April last year?

SENATOR THE HON. MICHAELIA CASH, MINISTER FOR JOBS AND INNOVATION:

That's correct, absolutely.

PRIME MINISTER:

How many jobs has that - how many young people have found themselves into full-time  employment as a result of that?

MINISTER FOR JOBS AND INNOVATION:

We've now seen across Australia, in excess of 16,000 young people have been hired as a result  of the Government's investment in youth unemployment and the good news for the people of  Queensland is Queensland is actually leading the country in terms of employers putting up their  hand and saying: "I'm prepared to take on a young person."

In excess of 4,600 young people have received a job since the PaTH program commenced.

PRIME MINISTER:

That's fantastic and I mentioned, there's been 100,000 jobs created in Queensland over the last  year.

MINISTER FOR JOBS AND INNOVATION:

12 months, yeah.

PRIME MINISTER:

42,500 of them are for young people. So the youth unemployment rate in Queensland has come  down. The participation rate across the board has gone up. There's a lot more work to do and  everything we're doing is designed to deliver stronger jobs growth.

I regret to say that the Labor Party wants to take away the tax cut that you've got, your company  has got. It wants to impose higher taxes and they've criticised the PaTH program. They have no  plan, no policy that would result in one business investing one dollar or hiring one extra person.  That's the big difference.

This is the issue; delivering that economic growth and the jobs that follow.

You've seen with the IMF's report today what the consequence of Donald Trump's big business  tax cuts in the United States have been. A huge increase in their forecasts for GDP growth in  America and globally because - again, this used to be as Scott Morrison was saying on the  radio this morning - the Labor Party used to know about this, Paul Keating certainly knew about  this. If you give businesses the opportunity to invest more, they will do so, the incentive to invest  more and then they will employ more. It's always worked in the past. It's pretty basic. It's  Economics 101 really and that's what Tom's doing here and it's what companies all around  Australia are doing.

That's why we're seeing that strong jobs growth and that's why we're seeing a more optimistic  outlook for the global economy driven off those big tax cuts in the United States. So that's why  we're pressing on with our Enterprise Tax Program, because we know that it will result in more  investment and more jobs.

Now, just getting back to the PaTH program though Michaelia, tell us a little bit more about how  it works and how you see the future of it?

MINISTER FOR JOBS AND INNOVATION:

Well, the program, as you know, was designed based on a lot of feedback from our young  people. What they need from a government program so they can get off welfare and into work.

It's a 3-step program. It's all about preparing our young people for the workplace. So after five  months of being on welfare, they will now undertake what's called employability skills training.  We are going to assist them to get the skills they need so that they can enter the workforce.

Then of course, we have fantastic employers like Tom here at the Eckersley Print Group who  put their hand up and say: "We'd like to be involved in the second phase of the PATH program,"  which is offering young people the opportunity to come on board and undertake an internship of  between four and 12 weeks. At the end of that internship is the third phase, the hire phase.

When we met John and Jarrod today - two young men who weren't quite sure what they were  going to do but they were able to take on board the internship offered by Tom - and as we've  seen, they have now successfully commenced four year apprenticeships. But what we've also

done is incentivised the employer because, as we know, it's a 2-step process. So Tom is now  able to access the youth wage bonus subsidy of up to $10,000, so he can continue to invest in  John and Jarrod.

So it's a great program. It's a flexible program obviously. But also we're really now seeing the  results in terms of in excess of 16,000 young people who were on welfare, who didn't know if  they could get a job, have now been hired because of fantastic employers like Tom.

PRIME MINISTER:

Great work and Tom, fantastic to be here, congratulations.

MR TOM ECKERSLEY:

Thank you. Thank you very much.

MINISTER FOR JOBS AND INNOVATION:

Absolutely. Thank you so much.

PRIME MINISTER:

We're happy to take some questions now.

JOURNALIST:

Just on the personal tax cuts the Treasurer was talking about this morning, when do you think  we’ll expect to see those and can the government really afford them?

PRIME MINISTER:

Well, that is our next agenda. As I've said, as both Scott and I have said many times, the timing  and the scale of those personal tax cuts will obviously depend on our budget process. The  budget is in May.

But we are committed to bringing the budget back into balance by 2020/21. So we've got to  manage all of the public finances to continue to provide the incentives for business, the tax relief  for middle income-earners, which we've already done of course, with one tranche of it. We want  to do more of that, but the timing and extent will depend on the budget circumstances.

JOURNALIST:

You mentioned the IMF report overnight there, Christine Lagarde says that too many people are  being left out of the growth in income over the years. Are you concerned that there won’t be that  trickle-down effect in the tax cuts?

PRIME MINISTER:

Look, I think trickle-down is a really inappropriate term, it's used by people like Bill Shorten who  just, who are addicted to tax. They want to tax. They want everyone's earnings to trickle, to  flood actually, into the government's coffers so they can spend it on their own objectives.

What you've seen again and again in this country and in other countries is, where you provide  incentives for business to invest, by reducing business taxes, then business will respond.  They're rational players, and when they invest more, they employ more, because they're  growing their businesses.

Paul Keating used to state that all the time. In fact, you can find plenty of quotes from Bill  Shorten when Labor was in government saying exactly the same thing. You know they've  become - he has created a chasm in terms of economic policy between the Coalition and the  Labor Party.

Shorten wants to tax individuals more. He wants to tax businesses more. He has no incentives  for investment and no incentives for employment.

You can see that our policies are working. We have added, in the last year, more jobs in a  single year than since we started counting, over 40 years ago. So it has been a terrific outcome.  We said jobs and growth was a slogan in 2016 in the election campaign. Now we're delivering it.

JOURNALIST:

While on the Labor Party, Mark Butler says ‘backroom buffoonery’ is killing the Labor Party.  What do you think of those comments?

PRIME MINISTER:

Well, I think he's got in the Labor Party, they've not only got ‘backroom buffoonery’ but they've  got front-of-stage economic idiocy from their leader.

As I said Bill Shorten is there at a time when we are seeing the benefits of our economic  policies. When you're seeing, you have Tom here talking about the importance of the incentives  we provided to this Australian family-owned business to invest and employ. Shorten wants to  take those incentives away.

What is that going to do? I tell you what, it's not going to create a single job. It will destroy  thousands.

JOURNALIST:

Prime Minister, is Australia closer to getting accepted into the Malabar Naval exercises with  India, Japan and the US?

PRIME MINISTER:

The discussions that we're having are progressing very well. As you know, we participated in  those exercises in the past and we are always looking forward to working with our partners in  the region in exercises of that kind.

JOURNALIST:

Prime Minister, on another military matter, Ben Roberts-Smith, VC winner, has backed in  Queensland’s bid for a $5 billion defence contract.

PRIME MINISTER:

Yes.

JOURNALIST:

Are you going to gainsay a VC winner?

PRIME MINISTER:

Well look, Ben Roberts-Smith is a great Australian hero. He is someone that all Australians look  up to in every respect. I remember at one Australia Day a few years ago, there was a  thunderstorm, you may remember, when we were announcing the Australians of the Year and  Ben was my rain shadow.

[Laughter]

He was fantastic, he was holding the umbrella and protecting us both.

Look, he is a great guy, a great, great Australian and he knows very well, as a long-serving  member of the Australian Defence Force, that these big contracts are examined very carefully,  very objectively by the Department of Defence. There are big probity issues, always, with these  things. They're assessed on their merits and Defence will bring recommendations to the Cabinet  in due course.

JOURNALIST:

Just on the issue of Sydney Trains -

PRIME MINISTER:

Yes.

JOURNALIST:

Can we just ask, I guess, if they go ahead with this strike on Monday are you going to step in to  stop it?

PRIME MINISTER:

Well it’s not a - this is very much a matter for the State Government to resolve.

But you have mentioned Sydney Trains and can I just say that, you know, our sympathy and  love goes out to all of those that were injured in the train crash in Sydney at Richmond. You  know, I've often travelled on that line and I can well imagine the horror of that crash, when the  train ran into the barriers, the bumpers at the end of the line there at Richmond.

JOURNALIST:

What’s your message to the unions holding the state to ransom though?

PRIME MINISTER:

Well, look, it's very clear that public transport in all of our big cities is an absolutely vital service,  an essential service, and particularly in all cities, the same is true where we are in Brisbane.

But you know Sydney is a very big city. It's very densely settled and public transport, rail, is  extraordinarily important, you know. It is moving millions of Sydneysiders around to work and  school and around their daily lives. So the unions should get on and do - and the members  should be able to do their jobs, standing over the government or the, you know, the public  transport authorities there with that type of threat of strike action, the only people that will suffer  are the commuters and they should be put first.

JOURNALIST:

Prime Minister the news coming out of Sydney this morning that a 40-year-old woman has been  charged with financing terrorism. Do you have any details on that?

PRIME MINISTER:

Look - I'm well briefed on the matter but I can't add to what has been in the public domain other  than to say there is no ongoing threat to the public.

This is another example of the excellent work of our Joint Counter Terrorism Teams between  the Australian Federal Police, ASIO and the New South Wales Police in this case. We work  very, very closely together. Good intelligence and good cooperation enables terrorist plots and  activities to be disrupted.

You've seen in Sydney of course recently the disruption of the plot to bring down an airline, you  know, with a bomb that was, you know, that plot was uncovered, the bomb was recovered.  Hundreds of lives would have been lost if that plot had been carried out.

So good intelligence, good cooperation, seamless cooperation is vital and this has been a good  result of that, that that arrest has been made, but I can't add any more to the detail at this stage.

JOURNALIST:

Does Tony Abbott have a point that we should reduce immigration to solve congestion and  home ownership woes?

PRIME MINISTER:

Look, our immigration program is skills-based, overwhelmingly.

We have a humanitarian component and, but of course, nowadays, under the Coalition, we  decide - the Australian government decides - which refugees come into Australia.

Under Labor, it was outsourced to the people smugglers. And that's - the borders are secure,  the people smugglers have been put out of business. It's a continuing threat, though, you've  seen, you know, they are constantly trying, but we've been successful in turning boats back and  ensuring that they are not able to market their wares.

So we have a humanitarian program, but the vast bulk of our immigration is skills-based. In  other words, it responds to the demands in the Australian economy and that sets us apart from  many other countries.

You know, in the United States, where immigration is obviously a very, very contentious issue.  You hear so many American leaders, including the President, talking about the merit of our  skills-based immigration program. And that is that those people that are coming in, are coming  in because the economy needs their skills and they haven't been able to be filled locally. And, of  course, at the same time we need to do more to ensure young Australians in particular, and  older Australians for that matter, have the skills the economy needs and the PATH program that  Michaelia was describing a moment ago was a big part of that too.

JOURNALIST:

Prime Minister, just on inland rail, Whyalla Steel has that contract, things seem to be moving.  Are you confident that there’s going to be no more internal dispute in the National Party about  the route from the Queensland border into the Brisbane Port. Is it all a go?

PRIME MINISTER:

Well, the alignment has been decided and it is all go. And you saw Barnaby there behind the  wheel of one of the engines the other day with the Australian Rail Track Corporation. We are  getting on with the job, we are building the inland rail.

This, by the way is 21st century infrastructure and Tom, you'd be interested to know that it was  first talked about in the 1890s so it's taken a little bit to get on with. Many governments have  talked about the importance of the inland rail linking Melbourne to Brisbane through the inland,  but it's our government that is getting on and building it and it's about time.

JOURNALIST:

Do you think New Zealand's offer to take asylum seekers has increased the number of boats  coming into Australia or trying to get to Australia and what kind of intelligence do you have that  boats that have been intercepted have been influenced by New Zealand’s offer to take them.

PRIME MINISTER:

Well, there are a number of boats, people-smuggling boats, that have sought to come to  Australia that have been intercepted by our Operation Sovereign Borders, which stated that they  were planning to go to New Zealand. And that's been the case, New Zealand benefits from our  Operation Sovereign Borders.

The people smugglers are absolutely ruthless. They use all of the social media we use - and  they use it very skilfully - and they market any scrap of information that they can and so they  were very busily marketing and promoting New Zealand as a destination recently, there's no  question about that. And obviously, that tends to result in more people getting on people  smugglers' boats and the only way to put them out of business is to make sure those boats go  back.

Now we know what happened, we don't have to theorise or speculate about border protection.  The Labor Party inherited secure borders from John Howard. They changed the rules and we  got 50,000 unauthorised arrivals, 1,200 deaths at sea. We came into government in 2013.  There are people that Kevin Rudd had put on Manus and Nauru and at the last minute when he  came back as Prime Minister he tried to revert back to a more disciplined approach.

The people on Manus and Nauru of course, Labor put them there. We're starting to move them  off and resettle them in other countries but it is absolutely fundamental that the message we  send to people who are being marketed to by people smugglers, we have this very clear  message.

If you seek to come to Australia by boat with a people smuggler, you will not succeed. You will  not get here. You will not settle in Australia. We will turn you back.

That then enables us to have a very generous humanitarian program where we decide which  refugees come and settle in Australia, not the people smugglers. That's the difference.

Under my government, the government, our government, which the Australian people have  elected, responsible to our parliament makes that decision as to who comes here, not the  people smugglers.

That's what Labor did and that's what they'd do again if they were back in government. We  know their form. It's, again, not theory or speculation. Labor proved its inability to protect our  borders when they were in government.

JOURNALIST:

Premier Palaszczuk has listed cyberbullying on the COAG agenda next month…

PRIME MINISTER:

Look, I would welcome that. We have actually - it's been the subject of discussion before with  premiers.

And, in my discussions with premiers, as you know, obviously, schools, the regulation of  schools, particularly public schools, state schools, are obviously in the hands of state  governments.

Cyberbullying is a dreadful threat. It's a curse. And, you know, we've obviously had that very,  very sad death of Dolly Everett, very sad. And I've been in touch with her dad about that and the  plans her family have to ensure that other kids are not driven to, you know, the point of taking  their own lives by cyberbullying.

Now, this is what we've done. We established when we came into government in 2013 an e-safety - Children’s E-Safety Commissioner for the first time ever. We've got new regulations  and new laws which give the police greater powers and, in particular, give our E-Safety  Commissioner the ability to require some of the social media platforms, you know, Facebook  and others to take damaging material down.

That Children's E-Safety Commissioner has had her responsibility widened to go beyond  children so she's now the E-Safety Commissioner, Julie Inman Grant, a very experienced  woman in the technology sector, has worked for Microsoft, Twitter, really knowledgeable. And it  is a very, very big exercise but it's something we all have to be part of. Parents have to be part  of it, take responsibility, recognise what your kids are doing online, make sure that the message  you're sending to them is to be respectful to each other online, just as you would, you know, in  the classroom or the playground.

Schools are a big part of it. It is a community effort because we've always had bullying, you  know, in - kids have always said unkind things about each other, I suspect that won't change.  But what the internet has done is it enables it to be amplified in a very damaging way. So the  zero tolerance to bullying is something that we have to really, really focus on. We've got to - we  can't just overlook it. Again, I don't think you'll ever eliminate it but that's got to be the goal.

We've got to make sure that kids are respectful to each other and be particularly focused on the  online environment because it does provide that ability to amplify and extend an unkind  comment in the classroom or the playground onto, you know, effectively or potentially a global  platform.

Okay, thank you all very much.
