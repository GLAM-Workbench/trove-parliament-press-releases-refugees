D ' - -I: n  DEPUTY LEADER of the OPPOSITION PRE SS RELEASE

V Pi A  SHADOW TREASURER

CONSUMER PRICE INDEX - DECEMBER QUARTER

The CPI figures released today indicate that Australia's  inflation rate remains more than double the average rate of  our major trading partners.  .

These figures confirm that there is little justification for  the Hawke-Keating Government's arrogance and complacency  about the state of the economy.

Prices continued to rise rapidly in the December quarter  when the CPI rose by 1.7 per cent, the same growth recorded  in the September quarter.

During the year to the December quarter 1987, the CPI  increased by 7.1 per cent. The most significant price .   increases included:

- rents for Government owned dwellings, which increased  by 15.2 per cent, a significantly higher rate of  growth than rents for privately owned dwellings,  which increased by 10.5 per cent;

- vehicle insurance charges, which increased by  17.3 per cent; and

- health service charges, which rose by 16.5 per cent.

Overall, the figures released today show that little  progress has been made in lowering our high cost structure  in the face of our increasingly difficult trading  environment.  .

The latest OECD statistics show that inflation in Australia  is running at more than double the average rate of our major  OECD trading partners.

The Hawke-Keating Government's failure to bring inflation  under control is testimony to the undeniable failure of its  wages policy. .

If the National Wage Case hearings result in yet another  across-the-board wage increase being granted without  productivity offsets, then the Government's wages policy  must certainly be regarded as irresponsible.

Such wage rises just add to inflation and no-one is really  any better of f .

DEPUTY LEADER of the OPPOSITION PRESS RELEASE

SHADOW TREASURER

SENATOR WALSH: A PROPHET CRYING IN THE WILDERNESS

Senator Walsh's CEDA address confirms what the Opposition  has been saying for some time.

Senator Walsh has warned that the economy is still in a  perilous position and that there can be no relenting from  the hard economic slog. .

Unfortunately, Senator Walsh's warnings appear to be falling  on deaf ears.

The Government has refused to make substantial fiscal  adjustments until after the NSW election.

Mr Willis is telling the Arbitration Commission that we can  afford a wage rise now.

Microeconomic reform is on the back-burner as the factions  and even the Ministry are split over privatisation.

Meanwhile, Australia's relative economic position remains  woeful.

Our inflation remains stuck at over 7% while inflation in  our major trading partners is around 3%.

Our interest rates remain substantially above those overseas  and in real terms are amongst the highest.in post-war  Australian history.

Our current account deficit is the second largest in the  OECD, as a proportion of GDP.

We are accumulating foreign debt at the rate of nearly  $1 billion a month.

Servicing our foreign debt is consuming over 64% of our  export earnings.

Our productivity growth is abysmal: it is forecast to rise 0.5% in 1987-88 compared with over 2% overseas.

Australia urgently requires:

.  substantial spending cuts in order to release domestic  resources to the tradeable goods sector; .
