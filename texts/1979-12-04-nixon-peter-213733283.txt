in civil coastal surveillance in northern Australia. .

The contracts relate to approximately one-third of the surveillance ~~

task, which is presently carried out under short term contracts for

the use of other types of aircraft.

Two of the contracts will be offered to Connair Pty. Ltd., of Alice

Springs, one to Bush Pilots Airways, of Cairns, and one to

Reprographics Pty. Ltd., of Brisbane.

The terms of each contract will specify the use of the Australian-  designed-and-built Nomad aircraft - in line with an earlier Government

decision. t* .  Ã¢ÂÂ

Mr Nixon, who is the Government spokesman on civil coastal surveillance,

said four of the Nomads would be involved in daily surveillance along  the northern coastline - three in Western Australia and the Northern

Territory and the fourth on the east coast of Cape York Peninsula in

Queensland.

"A further three Nomads, equipped with Litton 360 degree radar, will

be carrying out more specialised work in northern Australia", he said.

"Two of them will be based at Darwin to patrol the routes taken by

Vietnamese refugee boats and general surveillance of the northern

offshore islands. Another will be based on the Central Queensland -

Coast to patrol the Great Barrier Reef, mainly for detection of illegal

foreign fishing vessels. This aircraft will also enhance the search-

and-rescue capability of the area."

Mr Nixon said the.first of the new aircraft was expected to begin

operations early inÂ·the new year.

He said his Department, through the Australian Coastal Surveillance

Centre, had been responsible for co-ordinating the civil coastal v   surveillance task since July 1978. :

"In that time my Department has gained invaluable experience which

will form a solid basis for a full review of the Coastal surveillance

requirement, which will be carried out by the Government in 1981."
