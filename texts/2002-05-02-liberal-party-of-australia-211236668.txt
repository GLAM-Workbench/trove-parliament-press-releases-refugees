Australia to Provide Humanitarian Assistance to the Palestinian Territories

I am pleased to announce Australia will provide $1 million in humanitarian assistance to help relieve the suffering of those affected by recent violence in the Palestinian Territories.

While the humanitarian situation in the Palestinian Territories remains serious, the withdrawal of Israel from several areas has meant international aid agencies now have increased access to affected communities.

Major donors have begun implementing an Emergency Response Plan with the Palestinian Authority to assess the scale of the damage and determine immediate needs.

Australia will contribute $500,000 to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for humanitarian assistance and $500,000 to the International Committee of the Red Cross for medical assistance.

We believe that the ICRC and UNRWA are currently the best placed agencies to provide humanitarian assistance to those in need.
