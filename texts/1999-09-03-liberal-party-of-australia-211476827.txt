GOVERNMENT FUNDING BOOST FOR MIGRANT SETTLEMENT

Â

The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock, 
today announced funding init iatives totalling nearly $30.2 million 
over the next three years to assist migrants, refugees and humanitarian 
entrants settle in Australia.

Â

The Minister said the funding would be offered under 
the Department’s Community Settlement Services (CSS) Scheme to community 
and service organisations for up to three years to provide a range of 
settlement services in metropolitan and regional areas across Australia.

Â

Funded organisations are subject to continuing compliance 
with service agreements, which will include clearly defined work programs.

Â

The nearly $30.2 million dollar funding offer over 
the three year period is:

Â

-Â $16,706,968 in 1999-2000

-Â $ 9,930,576 in2000-2001; and

-Â $ 3,536,234 in 200l-2002.

Â

The Minister said just over $2.5 million dollars of 
the total 1999-2000 funding would go to extending the funding of a number 
of organisations, which are currently funded under the Integrated Humanitarian 
Settlement Strategy (IHSS).

Â

“The extension of funding to these organisations 
will ensure continuity of service provision to this particularly vulnerable 
group until new contracts come into effect from July 2000.

Â

“There has been a high level of interest in the 
CSS scheme, and as a consequence, competition for funding was very strong. 
308 applications have been successful out of a total of 605 applications 
lodged.” Mr Ruddock said.

Â

In total, 111 applications received funding for one 
year, 133 applications received funding for two years and 64 applications 
received funding for three years.

Â

The applications were assessed by DIMA against 11 
criteria that were provided in guidelines to all applicants.

Â

“The criteria included, among other things, the 
quality of the work program proposed by the applicant, and the capacity 
to deliver migrant settlement services, and to administer grant funds 
in accordance with Commonwealth accountability requirements,” Mr Ruddock 
said.

Â

“The assessment process is consistent with the recommendations 
of a report last year by the Australian National Audit Office (ANAO) 
on the provision of migrant

settlement services by my Department.”

Â

The Minister said the funding would enable organisations 
to provide a diverse range of services to migrants with settlement needs.

Â

‘‘The settlement services to be supported by the 
funding will include casework information and referral services, establishment 
of volunteer and self help groups, preparation of community needs analyses 
and community development initiatives,” Mr Ruddock said.

Â

“Priority groups for CSS Scheme funding include 
refugee and humanitarian entrants and recent arrivals whose communities 
in Australia are small and emerging.

Â

“The funding also supports services to migrants 
living in remote areas where support services may be difficult to access, 
as well as organisations serving more established communities with substantial 
proportions of aged.”

Â

“All CSS Scheme-funded organisations have an important 
role to play by providing their clients with the necessary support which 
will assist them to avail themselves of the opportunities and services 
available to all Australians,” Mr Ruddock said.
