Australia provides $1 million to the Kyrgyz Republic

18 June 2010

In response to an appeal from the International Committee of the Red Cross, Australia will provide

$1 million to communities adversely affected by civil conflict in the Kyrgyz Republic.

Australia remains concerned about the volatile situation in the Kyrgyz Republic and calls on the interim

government to restore law and order in accordance with democratic principles.

Australia supports internationally coordinated efforts to assist the Kyrgyz Republic.

Australian funds will enable the International Committee of the Red Cross to provide emergency supplies.

Australia will provide a small number of experts to work with United Nations agencies providing food,

shelter and other emergency assistance on the ground in affected areas.

This follows on from a request from the United Nations and the Red Cross/Red Crescent movement.

There is a critical need for food, health care, water, shelter and protection for over 300,000 internally

displaced persons. More than 40,000 people are in need of shelter.

Authorities in Uzbekistan have registered 80,000 refugees who have crossed the border from the Kyrgyz

Republic since the escalation of conflict.
