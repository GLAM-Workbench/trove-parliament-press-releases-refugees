THE HON RICHARD MARLES MP  SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND BORDER  PROTECTION  MEMBER FOR CORIO



MEDIA RELEASE

INQUIRY NECESSARY TO EXPOSE THE FACTS THE ABBOTT GOVERNMENT  REFUSE TO REVEAL

Labor has established a Senate inquiry into the Abbott Government’s operation of the  Nauru Regional Processing facility.

The Abbott Government’s response to the release of the Moss Review into allegations  at the Nauru Processing Centre last week was a disgrace, with the Immigration Minister  Peter Dutton telling reporters: “We have a great story to tell.”

The Moss Review addressed serious issues within the Australian-funded facility on  Nauru and deserved to be treated seriously by the Abbott Government.

The Review found allegations of abuse were credible within the centre. That is why  Labor believes it is important to have this inquiry and allow these issues to be  appropriately examined.

Regional processing is the cornerstone of Australia’s border protection policy and it  must be operated in a manner that provides asylum seekers with a safe and protective  environment.

This inquiry was established today and will and report on 15 June 2015.
