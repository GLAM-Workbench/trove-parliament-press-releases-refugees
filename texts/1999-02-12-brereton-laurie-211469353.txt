HOWARD ON EAST TIMOR

Â

“Prime Minister Howard’s statement on East Timor last night confirmed 
his government’s stubborn refusal to embrace the likelihood of East  
Timorese independence”, the Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs, Laurie 
Brereton, said today.

Â

“Mr Howard reaffirmed his strong preference for 
East Timor to remain part of Indonesia. He did so as Indonesian President 
Habibie foreshadowed that East Timor could be independent by the end 
of this year. Nothing could be more telling of Mr Howard’s chronic 
inability to come to terms with the flow of events in Dili and Jakarta.”

Â

“An independent East Timor will require considerable 
Australian support — politically, diplomatically and economically. 
Australia is duty bound to do all that we can to assist the East Timorese 
people build a better and secure future.”

Â

Specific measures called for by Labor over the past 
six months include:

Â

*Â Appointment of 
an Australian  Special Envoy on East Timor to ensure that Australia’s 
diplomacy is focussed and fully engaged in a period of rapid transition.

Â

*Â Australian 
commitment in principle to participate in a United Nations monitoring 
force in East Timor. Such a force will be essential to ensure an orderly 
and fully democratic process of self-determination.

Â

*Â Re-establishment 
of an Australian Consulate in Dili to enhance Australia’s ability 
to monitor events on the ground in East Timor.

Â

*Â Conduct 
of an urgent survey of East Timor’s development and humanitarian assistance 
needs and an Australian commitment of substantial resources to deal 
with the accelerating collapse of basic services and infrastructure 
in the territory.

Â

*Â Coordination 
of an expanded NGO aid effort in East Timor.

Â

*Â Commencement 
of preliminary discussions on possible arrangements for the Timor Gap 
Zone of Cooperation to ensure that an independent East Timor is able 
to take over Indonesia’s rights and responsibilities in the Timor 
Gap without disruption of existing and projected oil and gas projects.

Â

“Australia should be preparing for the likelihood of early independence 
for East Timor, but the Howard Government has taken none of these steps”, 
Mr Brereton said.

Â

“Prime Minister Howard says an independent East Ti mor will 
be ‘vulnerable and lonely’. His government’s persistent refusal 
to demonstrate leadership and play an active role appears designed to 
make this a self-fulfilling prophecy.”

Â

“Mr Howard’s approach will serve neither Australia’s 
national interests, nor our clear duty to do all we can to help people 
who are our friends and neighbours.”
