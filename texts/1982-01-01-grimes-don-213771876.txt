INVALID PENSIONS NOT 'SETTLED DOWN'

When the matter of invalid pensions was raised in Parliament  last September, Senator Chaney stated:

.  "The present information that we have would suggest  that the position has settled down and that there is  likely to be some small growth of numbers over the  coming year." (25.9.81) ;  .

Ministerial complacency should always prompt investigation,  in this case the evidence indicates that.invalid pensions  have not settled down, but have bogged down. The estimated  1  small growth1  of 1, 000 invalid pensioners cannot so far be  detected. .

To begin with, the number of persons on invalid pension has,  after a consistent increase in the past 15 years, declined  month, by month since the.crackdown took effect in June 1980.

Ã¢ÂÂ   In November 1981 there were 219,686 invalid pensioners, almost  10,000 fewer than in June 1980. If normal growth rates had  continued at the 1960s and 1970s rate there would have been  an additional 20,000 persons on invalid pension.

Of those 20,000 who might have expected to receive the pension  over the past eighteen months, some have appealed under the  mechanisms established by Senator Guilfoyle at the end of  1980 to take the heat out of the protests.

Between 1 January 1981 and 30 September 1981 medical appeals  were lodged with Social Security Appeals Tribunals by 5,638  people. Over a third of those appellants(35.4%) had the  invalid pension either granted or restored, with 29% being

conceded by the .Department without having to go to the  Social Security Appeals Tribunal and another 6.4% being won  after SSAT hearings. Only 1,157 (20%) of the appeals were  finalised in the Department's favour, and some of these are  now on their way to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.

It is unmistakeable proof that the guidelines, whether old or  new, were wrongly applied in 35% of the cases - and probably  more. How many more won't be known until the Social  Security Appeals Tribunals catch up with the 3,753 appeals  which were still outstanding at the end of September 1981

and those lodged since. (In New South Wales 2,019 appeals  were outstanding, only 20 fewer than there had been at the  beginning of January).  ;

The nine invalid pension appeals on medical grounds which '   were determined by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal between  July’  1981 and January 1982 have all gone against the  Department, with the qualification in one case that  rehabilitation training should first be attempted. In 8

of the 9 appeals invalid pension is to be backdated to  appropriate dates in 1980 when those pensions had been  refused or cancelled in line with the Lanigan rules.

Furthermore, the Department had conceded 23 medical appeals  before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal by November 1981.

An analysis of the reasons given by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in its decisions should encourage more appellants to  persevere.  .

The first important win by an appellant was in the case of  Mr. Willy Panke,. a 57-year old workman from Ballarat. After the Commonwealth Medical Officer had certified him as  85% incapacitated, a senior medical officer rejected the

recommendation. On appeal, another doctor found him  60-65% incapacitated. The Administrative Appeals Tribunal  found that following the medical evaluation of a person's  physical or mental impairment the second factor to be  ascertained is how that impairment affects the person's  ability to engage in paid work.  Â· .

That responsibility is with the Director-General of Social  Services, not the medical practitione~r^ as the Administrative  Appeals Tribunal pointed out. But up to 26 May 1981 the  Director-General had not reversed one favourable or unfavourable  recommendation made by a Commonwealth Medical Officer or by

the Health Department regarding a person's incapacity for work.

The Director-General, or his delegate in the Department, had  an obligation to assess factors other than medical, but had  not done so before the Panke case. A further question to  Senator Chaney:

"In how many cases since the Panke decision has  the Director-General granted an invalid pension  to a person who has not been classified at the  85% level, but has other disabilities under the  guidelines issued by the Minister early this year?"

Received the reply:- !

"No statistical collection is maintained in  relation to the information.sought".  (December 1981)

This could mean 'never'. If not, it. is inconceivable that  the few cases since May 1981 where it has occurred would not  have been recorded. The Minister and his Departmental  head are simply refusing to give information.

Senator Chaney said of the Panke case:

"... that decision..  is in accordance with the  guidelines.  It is simply that a wrong decision  was taken in that case. Having in mind the  number of decisions made, there would be no  argument.. that of course some wrong decisions  will be made.." '

This is a glib comment, even by. Senator Chaney's standards.

It is not just a matter of 'a wrong decision'. It is thousands  and thousands of wrong decisions.

Of the 9 appeals to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, 8 have been upheld with the ninth to be reconsidered in a  year's time, and another 23 conceded without a fight. Almost  2,000 were won or conceded before the Social Security Appeals  Tribunal, with thousands more queuing up to be heard.

Senator Chaney again - '  ‘

"The Administrative Appeals Tribunal in its  jurisdiction in this area will have proved to be  rather fruitless if., it does not tellus that on  occasions our administration is not correct,  that on occasions we. are not applying the  law correctly.." (19.11.81)

The Administrative Appeals Tribunal is telling Senator Chaney -  if he is listening - that the Department has only a partial 1  in 9 .  success rate there - that 90% of the original  decisions were not correct.

At the Social Security Appeals Tribunal the Department has  barely a 1 in 5 success rate.

The 1  on occasions’  formula is spurious nonsense. It is the  initial decision-making in the Department of Social Security  which is at fault. The medical guidelines need overhauling;  and all medical assessments in relation to incapacity should  be reviewed in the light of other medical, social and

employment factors. The Administrative Appeals Tribunal  appears to have sought background information vital to the  understanding of the cases when the Department has not  bothered to do so.

Instructions should be circulated within the Department,  setting out. a more humane, more thorough and more professional  approach to invalid pension cases. It is stupid and expensive  to pay out $1 million a year to Tribunals so that they can  reverse decisions which should never have been made. There

is no denying that the $235 a day which Administrative Appeals  Tribunal members are paid is excellent value in terms of  justice to the appellants and its demonstration of how badly  the Department of Social Security has been administering its  own legislation.

The Department has a deplorable record of refusing the invalid  pension to so.many applicants who were entitled to it; of delays  (of up to a year) in making decision; and of ignoring the  human misery its rigid criteria have caused.

Invalid pension applicants, particularly those refused between  June 1980 and June 1981,will lose little by further appeals.

SINGLE PARENTS ON UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS

The Henderson Poverty Report and the Report on Poverty Measurement  identified single parent families as among the poorest  groups in Australian society.

Within that group, one category is significantly poorer. They are the.2,418 single parent families who are paid  unemployment benefit, not supporting parent's benefit.

.  A lone parent on supporting parent's benefit  who has 2 children receives $106.20 a week  ($23.50 below the poverty line) but is eligible  for fringe benefits and supplementary (rent)

assistance. '

.  A lone parent on unemployment benefit who  has two children receives $98.20 a week  ($31.50 below the poverty line), and is not  eligible for fringe benefits (except the .

health care card) and supplementary .

assistance.

Some of the single parents on unemployment benefit will be  persons who do not satisfy the 5-year continuous residency  reguirements.  Some, I suspect, are ignorant of the fact  that they would be better off if they moved to supporting  parent's benefit or widow's pension. ;

They will get no help from the Social Security Department. When I asked Senator Guilfoyle what steps were taken to  persuade such recipients that they would benefit financially  by receiving supporting parent's benefit while looking .

for work, she replied:

"... a person who has applied for and is qualified  to receive an unemployment benefit is not  qualified to receive a supporting parent's  benefit.  Accordingly, it would not be  appropriate to invite applications for

supporting parent's benefit from recipients  of unemployment benefit."

At least four courses are open to the Department:-1. Identify unemployment benefit recipients eligible ,   for supporting parent's benefit or widow's  pension and assist their transfer;

2. Legislate to give single parent unemployment  beneficiaries the guardian's allowance presently  paid to single parent pensioners and beneficiaries;

3. Raise the guardian's allowance for all single parent  pensioner and beneficiary families;  and

4. Extend supplementary assistance to unemployed  families in the same manner in which it is paid  to sickness beneficiaries.

Though only 2,418 families are involved, we should not tolerate  the situation where a parent with two. children is required to  exist on a weekly payment which is $31.50 below the poverty line.

SOCIAL SECURITY INVESTIGATIONS AND 'CQ-HABITATION'

The Council of Social. Services and Parents Without Partners  (West Australian Branches)  made recommendations to Senator  Chaney (May 1981) aimed at providing a clearer and more open  approach to the difficult task of establishing pension eligibility

(They have formulated their proposals with the single parent in  mind, but they apply equally to the invalid and age pensioner  sharing accommodation with a person of a different sex.) I  list these proposals:- Â·

- 5 -

1. The Department of Social Security should adopt  a more objective criteria for judging the  existence of a de facto relationship.

2. Written information on the criteria used by the  Department of Social Security in assessing the  existence of a de facto relationship should be  given to pension/benefit recipients at the time  their initial eligibility is established , or  if at any other time their eligibility is in  question. The right of appeal against decisions  based on these criteria should be made quite clear

to pension/benefit recipients. ... '  1  .

3. Pension/benefit recipients should be clearly informed  of which changes in their circumstances they are  obliged to notify the Department of Social Security.

4. Department of Social Security staff be prohibited  from acting on information about pension/benefit  recipients unless the informant is prepared to  give their name and address to the Department.

5. Information received by Department of Social Security . and resulting in investigation should be divulged to the pension/benefit recipient at the outset of the  investigation.

6. Pension/benefit recipients either being investigated by the Department or just having a routine interview,  should be clearly informed of : Ã¢ÂÂ  Â· .

a. their option to be interviewed in the office  Ã¢ÂÂ¢  rather than their home; .

b. their option of consulting with other parties .   about the implications of making a statement .  prior to doing so; .  ;

c. the purpose of the interview;

d .  the consequences of failing to attend the interview; and

.  e. the option of bringing someone with them to the  interview.

7. .  A trial period for de facto relationships should be established before pension eligibility is affected.

I consider that (7) would present considerable difficulties, but  that the first six recommendations have much to commend them.

Senator Chaney's response included the following defence of  current departmental practice:

"While the recommendations might further the, cause of  client rights and privacy, they would make the detection  of incorrect payments, particularly fraud, more  difficult and costly. Recommendation 1-5, for instance,  would require dishonest clients to be forewarned and hence

forearmed against attempts to uncover their dishonesty." I

I am sorry that Senator Chaney, a lawyer, makes such presumptions  of fraud and dishonesty. It is an attitude which inevitably generates spying, moralising and improper suppositions, which he  rates as more important than privacy,  dignity and an unprejudiced

- 6 -

approach to persons (generally women) believed to be in a bona  fide domestic relationship. .

Directly informing clients of rights and rules is essential for  their understanding of how the Social Services Act,as applied  by departmental officers, affects their pension eligibility. I believe it would lead to more care, less confusion and  less resentment. :

If there is no cause for the Department at the initial interview  to cancel or amend payments, then a good deal of snooping time  is saved, not to mention the feelings of persons who would  otherwise have the indignity of neighbours and shop assistants  being required to report on their personal lives.

If there is a relationship which would preclude payment of a  pension or benefit,  then either the domestic arrangements might  be changed or the payment stopped.

If fraud has occurred over some time this will generally show  up in the records, and action could well be warranted. Again,  nothing .is lost by informing a client that pension rights are  being investigated.

A frank exchange between a departmental officer and the client  on the consequences of infringing the Department's guidelines  is surely desirable.

Cat-and-mouse games are not.

DECLINE IN REAL VALUE OF PENSIONS

"The real value of pensions will be preserved" said Malcolm  Fraser in his 1975 Policy Speech.

The truth is that the real value of pensions has dropped in  relation to average weekly earnings, and will decline further  unless additional payments are made to pensiohers and beneficiaries

The single rate pension has fallen from the level of 23.2% of .   average weekly earnings in. December 1975 to 22.08% in December  1981, its. lowest level under the Fraser Government.

If the standard pension had been 1  preserved1  at the December 1975  rate it would now be $73.25 a week, instead of $69.70.

Over 2 million pensioners and beneficiaries whose pensions are  indexed to the Consumer Price index, are affected. They already  lose four months' increase because the Department delays the  pension adjustments. Now they are falling behind relative to  wage and salary earnings. .

In the same period the single rate of adult unemployment benefit  has dropped from 23.2% to .18.3% of average weekly earnings.

The under-18 rate has been frozen altogether under the Fraser  Government; and now represents only 11.4% of average weekly earnings  a terrible indictment of this Government's attitude to the young  unemployed.
