THE HON RICHARD MARLES MP  SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND  BORDER PROTECTION  MEMBER FOR CORIO



E&OE TRANSCRIPT  TELEVISION INTERVIEW   SKY AM AGENDA   WEDNESDAY 30 JULY 2014

SUBJECT/S: Government’s handling of asylum seekers.

DAVID LIPSON: Shadow Immigration Minister Richard Marles joins us now  from Melbourne, what do you make of that development? And good morning as  well.

RICHARD MARLES: Good morning David. Look I didn’t hear really any new  detail in that last night, what I heard was a whole lot more spin from the  Immigration Minister who frankly has been engaging in policy on the run.

LIPSON: Isn’t it significant if India is considering taking not just Indian citizens,  but also those that were in some ways treating India as a transit country, those  from Sri Lanka who had fled as Tamils?

MARLES: Well nothing that the Immigration Minister has said gives us any  sense of what India is considering at all. Let’s be clear, the only reason those  asylum seekers are at the Curtin Detention Facility now is because Scott  Morrison’s negotiations with India patently failed. And this is a Minister who has  been engaging in policy on the run - a few weeks ago India wasn’t the plan at  all, the plan apparently was to try to return this entire group to Sri Lanka. So we  have seen him go from Sri Lanka, to India, they’re now back at the Curtin  Detention Facility. And the only reason any of that is happening is because the  High Court has had to step in where this Minister has failed. Now twice in the  last few weeks we’ve seen the High Court make a decision because this Minister

has got it wrong, and really his portfolio and his management of it is in a state of  shambles.

LIPSON: You say it’s policy making on the run, but we don’t normally get boats  coming from India. Don’t you in that case have to develop policy as the situation  emerges?

MARLES: David there was a very clear response that could have been  undertaken by this Government which would have simply been to take this  vessel to Christmas Island to engage in an enhanced screening process, either  there or at Manus. To return those who are not genuine, and to have those who  aren’t sent to Manus or Nauru, there was never any question of these people  getting a permanent protection visa in Australia and the only reason why the  Minister didn’t walk down that very obvious path was because he was trying to  protect his political scoreboard. We had 150 plus asylum seekers floating around  on an Australian customs vessel in the Indian Ocean for the better part of a  month, simply to protect this Minister’s political reputation. They would have  been in wretched conditions, it would have cost the Australian taxpayer a bundle  and it was all about his personal ego it had nothing to do with the national  interest.

LIPSON: Labor’s position is that these asylum seekers should have been taken  to Christmas Island long ago. But what should happen to them after that once  they’re processed? Do you support the plan to send them back to India which is  not a signatory of the refugee convention?

MARLES: Well if they were not found to be genuine refugees then they should  be facilitated back to their home and that might either be India or Sri Lanka. If  they were found to be genuine refugees, then they should have been taken to  Nauru or to Manus, that is the simple course which could have been applied  here. Bear in mind this boat was intercepted near Australian territorial waters  and so what we saw was having the interception occurred, presumably the  vessel sailed most of the way to India or Sri Lanka. We don’t know that, but that  appears to be what was the case given the discussions the Minister then had  with the Indian Government , then it sailed all the way back to Cocos Islands,  people are flown back to Curtin. The reality is they’ve been all over the Indian  Ocean over the last month and the only reason that happened was because this  Minister was doing triple somersaults in order to try and protect his political  scoreboard. This was not in the national interest, it cost taxpayers a bundle, and  this is a Minister who was ultimately forced to take the steps he did, by firstly  their failure in the negotiations with India and secondly because the High Court  stepped in. This is policy on the run. There is no significant advancement which  has occurred by virtue of anything the Minister has done over the last month.

LIPSON: Fairfax Press today is reporting today that a group of Catholic and  Christian Church leaders have accused the Abbott Government of “state  sanctioned child abuse” in the immigration detention system. That is pretty  strong language, is it language that Labor supports?

MARLES: It’s to state the obvious that everyone needs to be doing everything  they can to have children taken out of detention, and certainly that was the  attitude of Labor in Government.

LIPSON: Sorry to interrupt but we have to go and as Tony Abbott has just got  to his feet, we’ll take you to Western Sydney now.
