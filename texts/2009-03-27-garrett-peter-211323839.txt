GOVERNMENT BACKS EARTH HOUR

Environment Minister Peter Garrett today confirmed that all of the 128 Australian  Government departments and agencies in Australia have registered to participate in Earth  Hour this Saturday.

Minister Garrett said the mass action covers more than 1,500 government buildings and  more than 3.7 million square metres of floor space.

“The Government is doing its bit this Saturday to support the millions of Australians voting  ‘Earth’ by switching off their lights this Earth Hour,” Mr Garrett said.

“The lights will go out at the Federal Court of Australia, the Australian War Memorial,  Parliament House, Australia’s Casey Station in Antarctica and more than 80 Australian  embassies and posts around the world.”

The Government effort has been coordinated by the Department of the Environment, Water,  Heritage and the Arts.

“Earth Hour presents an opportunity to raise public awareness of the importance of energy  efficiency and it also shows us what we can achieve when unite for a common cause through  the simple act of switching off the lights.

“I’ll be at the Earth Hour concert in Melbourne’s Federation Square which is powered by  more than 1,000 cyclists who have donated their time over the last week to give us a chance  to gather and reflect on the positive things we can do to reduce our impact on the  environment.

Mr Garrett said more information on what is being done to help Australians move to more  energy efficient homes from energy rating labels to minimum energy performance standards  and much more is available at www.environment.gov.au.
