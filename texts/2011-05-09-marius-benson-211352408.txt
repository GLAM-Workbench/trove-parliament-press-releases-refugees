TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW - ABC NEWSRADIO WITH MARIUS BENSON

SUBJECT: BUDGET 2011; REGIONAL COOPERATION FRAMEWORK.

E  & O E - PROOF ONLY



JOURNALIST:  Penny Wong, good morning.

WONG: Good morning to you.

JOURNALIST: Penny Wong, can I ask you about the Budget which is being brought down  tomorrow. And there is word out that Labor particularly wants this identified as a Labor  budget.  There are obviously some very Labor earmarked schemes like $300 million for  pensioners so they can install free set-top boxes.  But that's small change, even $300  million in a $400 billion or thereabouts Budget.

WONG: Well this is a Labor budget; it's very much focused on jobs, on spreading the  opportunities of the mining boom and also getting us back into the black by 2012-13 as we  committed to.  Just as we focused on jobs in our response to the global financial crisis, now  that we see this mining boom gathering pace in the years ahead, we need to leverage that  opportunity, create more jobs and get more people into jobs and make sure we can  continue to train people so they get better jobs.

JOURNALIST: But jobs is no Labor monopoly.  As a policy, every government aims for that  as probably the number one priority.  And it was John Howard's proudest boast that he  pushed unemployment down.

WONG: Marius, I think we should be aware that the Leader of the Opposition opposed the  stimulus, opposed the Government putting money into the economy when the global  financial crisis hit.  His policies would have led to 200,000 more Australians being on the  unemployment queue.  So Tony Abbott can't hide behind John Howard for his jobs record.  The fact is he made the wrong call then and he continues to make the wrong call.

JOURNALIST: Senator, the Government has been putting out quite a few little tidbits from  tomorrow's budget. $5000 in instant tax deductions for small business vehicles, I think that's  in the Fin Review today.  The $300 million for pensioner's set top boxes, accelerated tax

relief for the lower paid.  All good news items that the Government wanted to draw attention  to in the days before the Budget.  It doesn't sound like the tough Budget that Labor was  promising.

WONG: You'll have to look at what we present on Budget night.  But the circumstances are  very clear.  We are going to see a hit on revenue in the early years.  The Treasurer has  made that clear.  That makes our task more difficult because we have to look to the  medium and longer term.  We chose to bring the budget back to surplus because we know  we have a very large wave of mining investment that's going to continue to put pressure on  the economy in the years ahead.

And we have had to make some difficult decisions to ensure we meet that challenge.  But  budgets are ultimately about priorities and they're about making sure that you spend on the  right things as well as making the right savings decisions.

JOURNALIST: As I said there's been a lot of good news over the past week.  You've taken  tough decisions, difficult decisions you say.  Who'll feel the pain most?

WONG: We are a day before the Budget, Marius, and I'm sure that we'll have the  opportunity to speak again afterwards because the Treasurer will be presenting the Budget  tomorrow in the Parliament.

JOURNALIST: And your state Adelaide, the Adelaide Advertiser, your local paper says  South Australia will be dealt a particularly bad financial blow with up to $600 million slashed  from its share of GST earnings.  With a South Australian Finance Minister, is South  Australia actually going to do worse?

WONG: Well, arguments about the GST allocations between the states is not a new  argument.  If you're referring to the fact that revenues are lower in the earlier years than we  had previously anticipated because of the high dollar, because consumers are very  cautious.  People are saving a lot more now than they previously were.  That's not a new  story.  That is the fact of the patchwork economy.  People have decided that they want to  save more.  That's a good thing but that's going to have a consequence in terms of  revenues to Government.

JOURNALIST: Senator can I ask you in your capacity as a Cabinet Minister. The Australian  newspaper is reporting this morning that the deal with Malaysia about asylum seekers was  only announced to Cabinet Ministers two hours before it was announced publicly.  Is that  when you learnt about it?

WONG: Marius, you know I never discuss Cabinet processes but I will say the process  around this was appropriate.

JOURNALIST: Well this is not a Cabinet process.  This is when Cabinet was told about it  rather than discussed it.

WONG: Look Marius that is a question about processes of Cabinet but I will say it was an  appropriate process and this is a policy that is aimed at changing the incentives.  We know  that despite Tony Abbott saying he’ll just turn the boats back, that slogans won't do that.   What you have to do is change the incentives.  You have to change the business model.

You have to give people the message that it is not worth them getting on that boat and  that's what this policy is focused on.

JOURNALIST: Do you share the concern expressed by some other colleagues, specifically  Senator Doug Cameron, that the refugees may face mistreatment if they're sent to  Malaysia?

WONG: I saw Doug's comments and I think he says he wants to get more information at  our caucus meeting today and he's entitled to do that.  I would make the point about  Malaysia that they've made a range of commitments to the Government, including that they  would not return refugees to countries where they would face further persecution.  And that  they would treat these asylum seekers appropriately.

JOURNALIST: So your concerns are allayed by that?

WONG: I think that is a reasonable set of arrangements for the Government to enter into  and we're pleased that the Malaysian Government has made those commitments.  This is a  very difficult policy problem; I don't think anybody pretends otherwise.  What we do need is  a regional approach because we know that no one country in our region can end this.  We  are focusing on regional cooperation and this is a very important step in that.

JOURNALIST: Penny Wong thanks very much.

WONG: Good to speak with you.
