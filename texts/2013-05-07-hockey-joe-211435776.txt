‘LABOR’S BUDGET CHAOS’

TUESDAY 7 MAY 2013



**CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY**

The Treasurer Wayne Swan delivers his sixth budget next week.

He will deliver his sixth Budget deficit in six years.

I thought it would be an appropriate time to discuss what we should expect from the Budget

and the Coalition’s approach to the Budgetary challenges.

You would all be aware that there has been a dramatic U-turn in the government’s Budget

rhetoric.

It was just over 4 months ago that the Treasurer abandoned his “come hell or high water”

promise of a return to surplus this year.

That was the surplus that had been held out as the benchmark of sound economic policy.

For example the Prime Minister said emphatically that:

“You can’t run this country if you can’t manage its budget”1

The Prime Minister and her Treasurer promised without conditions or qualifications that they

would deliver a surplus on more than 500 occasions. Time and again this government has

extolled the virtues and necessity of returning the budget to surplus this year.

This time last year the Government devoted a considerable quantity of paper and ink to

spelling out the benefits of returning the Budget to surplus.

I want to quote from last year’s budget papers which say everything about the spin of the

Government in the lead up to this year’s election:

The Budget Papers said ….“Returning the budget to surplus… will contribute to

national saving and maintain confidence in the strength of Australia’s public

finances.”2

The Budget Papers said a surplus “… will support Australia’s capacity to respond to

unexpected adverse events” (p4-3)

The Budget Papers said…“Higher government saving creates a fiscal buffer for

uncertain times… ” (p4-4)

The Budget Papers said…..“The overall budget position can affect expectations and

confidence.  Public finances that are viewed as unsustainable generate

uncertainty…..A credible strategy to maintain fiscal sustainability therefore provides

a positive foundation for long term decision making by households and businesses.”

(p4-17)

And the Budget Papers said……“Returning the budget to surplus will also help

maintain confidence in the strength of Australia’s public finances as reflected in

Australia’s AAA credit rating” (p4-18)

Getting the drift? These are not my words, these are the government’s words from their own

Budget papers just 12 months ago.  There is more but I will save you the pain.

I don’t disagree with any of assertions. But now the Government is not delivering a surplus I

expect they don’t agree with their own words. This is a joke. I see Vince Sorrenti is speaking

a little later. He is not the only terrific comedian in Australia…Wayne Swan deserves a paid

gig at your MBA lunch next year.

The Budget Papers last year were not worth the paper they were written on. I fully expect this

year’s Budget will be the same.

Clearly they have abandoned all those benefits that they know would flow from more

responsible budget management.

Just two weeks ago rating agency Standard and Poor’s warned that Australia’s hard won

AAA credit rating (last lost under Labor and reclaimed under the Coalition) will come under

threat if the government does not show a commitment to eliminating the budget deficit.

Any downgrade would drive up funding costs for the government sector, including the States,

and for corporate Australia and the banks.  Inevitably these higher costs would be passed on

to consumers and to home buyers and small business borrowers.

A downgrade might also shake investor confidence in Australian dollar assets.

It is imperative that a downgrade be avoided.

Although the surplus is gone the Government has not revealed the true budget position.

Two weeks ago the Treasurer said there was a shortfall of $7.5 billion in revenue but did not

tell us the bottom line.3

Then a week ago the Prime Minister upped the ante and claimed a $12 billion revenue

shortfall - again without giving details on the size of the deficit.4

And today the Minister for Finance Penny Wong confirmed media reports the shortfall could

be $17 billion.5

Further reports suggest it will rise to $20 billion next year, with a likely write-down over the

four budget years of between $60 billion and $80 billion.

We will find out the size of the deficit next week. However, private sector estimates suggest

the budget is in very serious trouble.

National Australia Bank forecasts a deficit of $10 billion to $15 billion this year.

Bank of America Merrill Lynch suggests it could be even higher at $20 billion.

Macroeconomics and other forecasters are in a similar a similar place.

That would make 9 deficits in a row with Labor running the Budget. That would be

cumulative deficits of over $230 billion under this Labor Government - and 15 Labor deficits

in a row since Labor last delivered a surplus in 1989-90.6

Over the past 3 decades no government has run nine deficits in a row.  Not one.

This government has never run a surplus and it now seems as I have been saying for four

years, it never will.

This government - if re-elected - is on track to set a new benchmark in fiscal incompetence

and you will pay.

The government wants to blame anything and anyone else for the budget mess.

They say that revenues have been slow to recover from the financial crisis in 2008.

The mid year Budget update shows that revenue this year was expected to increase by $37

billion.  Even after the $17 billion writedown, revenue this year will increase by $20 billion

higher than last year.  That is a rise of over 6%, or more than double the rate of inflation.

Wayne Swan described this as a “sledgehammer hit to revenue”. His grandiose rhetoric

suggesting a wrecking ball impact on the Budget when in fact his revenue increased by $20

billion. No wonder business and consumer confidence is fragile!

The reality is that this is a budget disaster of the government’s own making.

First, the Gillard government is now spending over $90 billion more per year - about 35 per

cent - compared to the last year of the Howard government, despite inflation of just 14 per

cent over the entire period.  This is a huge increase in real “on budget” spending.

Of course on top of that there is the “off budget” spending on the potentially $94 billion

Government’s NBN and the $10 billion CEFC.

This government simply cannot live within its means.

Second, the government has been squandering the proceeds of the biggest mining boom in

our history. The terms of trade peaked in September 2011 at the highest level ever recorded.

And even after coming off they are still 14% higher than at the highest point of the Coalition

government.

The government has been unable to deliver a budget surplus during the highest terms of trade

on in history.

The Treasurer has tried to blame the fall in the terms of trade and the persistently high

Australian dollar for the shortfall in revenue.  This is a little strange because in his last mid

year statement the Treasurer forecast that the terms of trade would fall and that the Australian

dollar would remain strong.

MYEFO had this to say about the terms of trade.

“The terms of trade are now expected to fall 8 per cent in 2012-13,. ”7

Since then the terms of trade have fallen by 7.8%, pretty much as forecast. So no unexpected

collapse you would say!

In the same mid year statement the Government had this to say about the Australian dollar.

“The exchange rate is assumed to remain around its recent average level…a United

States dollar exchange rate of around 102 US cents.”8

The Australian Dollar is currently just under 103 US cents.  Again, these values are little

different to the forecasts.

The Treasurer cannot claim he didn’t see it coming!

Third, the government has a blind spot when it comes to making realistic assessments of

spending.

For example, it now looks likely the government will massively underestimate asylum seeker

costs.

In February annual spending on border protection policies was estimated to fall by almost $2

billion.9

This is based on an expectation that the government’s policy is going to stop the boats.

The trouble with that assumption is that on any rational basis it is, in fact, ridiculous. There

has been massive growth in boat arrivals and asylum costs since 2008 and a particularly sharp

increase this year.

In fact since the Government cut the budget on the basis that the  boats would stop in

February, 102 boats carrying 7273 people have arrived. Moreover, more people and boats

came in April than at any other time in Australian history…46 boats in April carrying 3369

asylum seekers.

This government cannot pretend that there is no problem with asylum seeker boats and not

provide for their associated costs in the Budget.

The evidence is that their policies are simply not working.

Fourth, the government has massively overestimated the revenue from the carbon and

mining taxes.

The Carbon Pricing Mechanism commenced on 1 July 2012, with a fixed price period of

three years, commencing at $23 this year and rising to $25.40 a tonne in 2014.

In 2015 the scheme will transition to a flexible price and be linked to the European market.

Revenue projections for that year are based on an estimated carbon price of $29 a tonne.  At

this price the government expects to collect $10.5 billion in carbon tax revenue that year

alone.

The problem is that the European carbon price is now trading at less than $5 (Ã¢ÂÂ¬3.78) a tonne,

about one fifth of the forecasted price.

Reports now suggest the government will reduce the Budget estimated price in 2016 to $15 a

tonne, with an estimated cost to revenue of around $3 billion.  Does anyone really believe the

price of carbon will triple in Europe in the next three years?  That the European economy is

doing so well that carbon emissions will surge and the price of permits will triple? Come on!

The Mining Tax (Minerals Resource Rent Tax) is similarly flawed.

This is a tax that has been through 5 different structures with 7 different sets of revenue

estimates.

The original mining tax (Resources Super Profits Tax) was meant to raise around $6 billion a

year.

The revenue estimates have been progressively reduced such that the seventh and latest

version of the MRRT was estimated to raise around $2 billion a year.

Now the government has been forced into admitting the tax raised just $126 million in its first

six months.

The problem is that the government linked expenditure of at least $15 billion to the revenue.

The original Mining tax package was projected to make the Budget worse off by $6 billion.

It has not disappointed. It has outperformed expectations. As it stands it will probably leave

the Budget substantially worse off.

This morning the Minister for Finance confirmed that the government is now dumping the

increase in the $1.8 billion Family Tax Benefit increases in last year’s Budget.

Mr Swan described this in great detail, saying:

“the funds for company tax cuts have been redirected to families in a way that also  helps the economy, including small businesses. At the core of this package is $1.8  billion in extra support for families through more generous payments from July next  year. More than 1.5 million families will benefit from increases to Family Tax Benefit

8



Part A, with nearly half taking home an extra $600 a year.”10

You might recall that this payment was a redirection of the company tax cuts that never

eventuated.  So no company tax cut and no FTB Part A.  That’s two broken promises from

the one tax!

Only this Treasurer could introduce a tax that raises almost no revenue, yet increases

Australia’s sovereign risk profile, adds record levels of red tape for business, and creates a

huge structural hole in the budget.

Framing the Budget - What the Treasurer must deliver in the Budget

After the mismanagement and confusion of the past 5 years the Treasurer must come clean

with the Australian people.

The first requirement will be honesty.

Forecasts of revenue and spending must be soundly based.

The forecasts of revenue for the carbon and mining taxes must be realistic.

Forecasts of spending on asylum seeker costs must be based on the reality that the

government’s policies have failed.

The forecasts of the nominal growth in the economy must reflect the reality of the medium

term winding down in commodity prices and the terms of trade.

There must be no more money shuffling and raiding of dividends to engineer paper

outcomes.

The second requirement will be a realistic medium term budget strategy with achievable

fiscal rules.

The core of the government’s medium-term fiscal strategy is to achieve budget surpluses, on

average, over the medium term.

This is a worthy and sensible goal.



10  Wayne Swan, 2012-13 Budget speech, 8 May 2012

However, the Treasurer has never said how long the medium term is.

With 9 years of deficits in prospect the medium term must be very long indeed. Maybe it’s a

generation, maybe it’s a century or in the case of Wayne Swan maybe it’s a millennium.

The Treasurer must make a believable commitment to returning the budget to surplus as soon

as possible. Ideally that would be next year.

Repairing the integrity of the budget will require a sustained period of solid surpluses to

offset the 5 years of massive deficits.

Third, the Treasurer must present a believable strategy for stabilising and then repaying the

massive Labor debt.

The face value of Commonwealth government debt on issue subject to the debt limit is now

$267 billion.11

Just to repeat - that is over a quarter of a trillion dollars in debt, the highest on record.  That is

an increase of $200 billion in just 5 years.

And that is before adding the additional debt going forward that will arise from the latest

deterioration in the budget position.

It should be no surprise that in the Budget last May the government raised the debt limit for

the fourth time to a record $300 billion.

It is likely that in May the Treasurer will come cap in hand again to further increase the debt

limit.

Will it be $350 billion?  Will he ask for $400 billion?

When is enough enough?

Fourth, the Treasurer must come clean on the taxation burden he is imposing on the

Australian people.

This Government has announced 30 new or increased taxes.  The latest is an increase in the

Medicare levy which will raise about $3.3 billion in its first year.

And the Prime Minister has said that everything is on the table for consideration, even

measures that she previously said were off the table.

It is clear more taxes are coming.  Businesses and households should be nervous.

This government maintains the fantasy that they are a low taxing government.

But the government is making up shortfalls in revenue through massive borrowings.

And every Australian knows that today’s debt is tomorrow’s taxes.

Last year the Government’s total call on present and future taxpayers - including taxes,

borrowings and dividends - was nearly 25.7 per cent of gross domestic product. That is

higher than in any year of the previous Coalition Government.

From time to time the Coalition has been criticised for not putting forward policy ideas.

We find this somewhat puzzling because we have in fact announced over 40 policies,

initiatives and discussion papers since the last election.

One policy that is near to your hearts is in industrial relations.

We will have more to say about the broader issue soon but I can tell you that we are very

concerned about increased trade union militancy in the building and construction industry.

So we will bring back a very well resourced Australian Building and Construction

Commission with all the powers necessary to give builders back the control of their

businesses whilst providing a safe and productive workplace.

That is an article of faith for us and it is a rolled gold policy commitment.

Our Strategy

Ladies and Gentlemen, The Budget position has dramatically deteriorated over the past year.

The Budget is in bad shape, but no one knows by how much. Next week we will be looking

hard for the “real” numbers beneath the rhetoric.

Given the uncertainties, I can promise that the Coalition will deliver a better budget bottom

line than Labor.  However, we cannot map out a strategy to return the budget to a sustainable

11



position until we see the real numbers in the Pre-Election Economic and Fiscal Outlook.  It is

only the PEFO figures which are largely free of politics in that they are signed off by the

Secretaries of Treasury and Finance rather than the Treasurer.

One thing I can say though is that the Coalition will not be engaging in a public spending

auction with Labor.  The cupboard is bare - there is no money left in the till.

The Coalition is focussed on saving money, cutting unnecessary programs, cutting waste and

ending mismanagement.  The alternative plan that the Coalition has put forward for the NBN

is an example of this - delivering the speeds consumers can actually use, at an earlier date,

and for far less taxpayers’ money.

The Coalition will look to stabilise debt in its first term.

Over the medium term the Coalition will reduce gross debt as a percentage of GDP.

We will achieve these objectives through five steps.

First, we will borrow less to fund our less expensive NBN.

Second, we will abolish the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and the need for the

associated funding.  This will liberate up to $10 billion of debt over five years.

Third, we will sell down the $10 billion of Mortgage Backed Securities on the balance sheet

of AOFM as market conditions permit, and reduce the associated borrowings.

Fourth, we will sell Medibank Private and other appropriate Commonwealth assets and use

the proceeds to reduce gross debt.

Fifth, we will balance the budget in headline terms and move it into surplus as soon as

practical.

And finally we will have an audit of all Government expenditure that ensures we deliver

more for less, in a far more efficient manner.

I believe the level of debt is a key indicator of the overall budget position.

Every household understands that you only have control of your budget once you stop

borrowing more money.

12



Getting a handle on gross debt has clear advantages.

It encapsulates the effect of all spending decisions and gets around the “above the line”

“below the line” debate.

It is less easy to manipulate through money shuffling between years.

It is the one budget parameter that is subject to a legislative limit.  That limit is currently

$300 billion but there is no doubt that the Treasurer will be seeking his fifth increase in the

limit next week.

It can be monitored weekly through the AOFM website.

And it is a budget metric which provides a direct measure of this government’s  failings - an

annual interest bill of $12 billion and rising which needs to be serviced by the Australian

taxpayer.

As an indicator of budget performance, debt is simple to understand, honest, and transparent.

I urge the Treasurer to include in next weeks budget papers the forecasts and projections for

the face value of Commonwealth Government securities on issue for each year of the forward

estimates.

Only then will we know how much further the government intends to max out the credit card

in pursuit of their re-election.

In reversing the growth of debt the Coalition will be mindful of the need to maintain

sufficient securities on issue to ensure deep and liquid markets and to ensure Commonwealth

Government Securities remain the anchor point for the Australian yield curve.

The previous Coalition government maintained securities on issue at around $60 billion in its

final years even while paying down debt by building up financial assets.

The pool of government securities necessary in today’s environment is likely to be

significantly higher than this to meet the liquidity needs of the local market.  We will task

AOFM to consult with the market to determine the appropriate stock of outstanding

securities.

13



Once gross debt is reduced to the desired level, further improvements to the fiscal position

will be channelled into building up financial assets to achieve the abolition of net debt.

A Prudent Approach to Budget Management

The Labor governments of Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard have been poor custodians of the

nation’s finances.  A string of budget deficits and ever escalating debt during the highest

terms of trade on record is just plain imprudent.  Continuing to blame their budgetary woes

on the GFC a half a decade after the event is wearing very thin.  The Treasurer admitted in a

recent speech that we are now

“Five years on from the darkest days of the global financial crisis.”12

The bottom line is that Labor has been cavalier with public money.  They don’t understand

that the government’s money is in fact taxpayer’s money.  I am not even sure they

particularly care.  Their focus is always how to spend other people’s money, not how to save

it.

As a nation we simply cannot go on spending more than we earn.  We have to learn to live

within our means.

We cannot afford one more minute of this Labor government, let alone another three years.

I can assure you today that the Coalition does understand that the government’s money is

your money.

The Coalition does understand that every dollar has to be spent wisely.

The Coalition does understand that the Commonwealth budget can only be put onto a

sustainable footing by reducing spending to match available revenue, and by halting the rise

in government debt.

The Coalition does understand the need for governments to manage the nation’s finances in a

prudent manner.

This government’s promises of budget surpluses and prudent fiscal management lie in tatters.

The Australian people deserve better.  The Australian people demand better.

The Coalition is ready.
