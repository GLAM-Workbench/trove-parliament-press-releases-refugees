THE HON SHAYNE NEUMANN MP

SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND BORDER PROTECTION  FEDERAL MEMBER FOR BLAIR

DUTTON DODGES RESPONSIBILITY



The Immigration Minister Peter Dutton has signaled he will not be taking any action in  relation to reports of abuse in Australia’s offshore detention centres.

In an interview on 2GB this morning, Mr Dutton downplayed the seriousness of the  reports, referring to them as “hype”.

Mr Dutton cannot abdicate his responsibility to provide safe, dignified and humane  treatment for all people seeking asylum and it is disingenuous of him to suggest the  Nauruan centre is not the Australian Government’s responsibility.

Where children are in offshore processing centres, they must be afforded first rate  health, mental health and education services and that any cases of abuse or  mistreatment are the subject of mandatory reporting.  That is why Labor continues to call for the creation of an Independent Children’s  Advocate, backed by adequate resources and statutory powers to ensure the rights and  interests of children are protected.  It is time the Turnbull Government addressed its own failure in finding a durable, third  country resettlement arrangement to resolve the fate of asylum seekers in offshore  processing centres.
