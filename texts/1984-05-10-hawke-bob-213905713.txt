CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY Â°ÃÂ½ÃÂ·

P R IM E  M IN IS T E R

STATEMENT TQ DELIVERY - 10 MAY 1984

Over the past few days,  powerful emotions have been  unleashed in this country and in this Parliament over the  issue of immigration.  We in this place have a particular  responsibility to ensure that what we do and say on this  matter is judicious,  calm and constructive.  There is a risk"

that if the debate on Immigration loses touch with facts and  departs from a civilised approach, racism and racial  intolerance could be promoted to the detriment of our  national unity and our basic values.

I know I speak for this Government, for the Australian Labor  Party and for the overwhelming majority of Australians in  rejecting racial intolerance and in calling for a measured

and humane discussion of these issues.

One of Australia's greatest achievements has been our  acceptance of people from widely diverse nationalities  around the world.  The enrichment of our national life by  new settlers since World War II ,  predominantly of Europeean  stock ,  has been palpable~. ....

Over the past decade, we have buried the White Australia  Policy for ever. We have shown our capacity to accept  people from Asian cultures,  many of whom have sought a new  life in Australia following the tragedy of the wars in

Indo-China in which Australia itself participated.

Surely no Member of this Parliament would wish to allow that  achievement to be called into question now by prejudice and  intolerance.

As The Australian stated in its Editorial of 9 May 1984 in  discussing the need for informed debate on immigration:

"Unless it is carried on with moderation and  respect for other points of view we shall come to  no sensible conclusion and Australia will become an

ugly place to live in."

It is therefore imperative that our debate be based on a  clear understanding of the facts and that the facts be  presented honestly and without a view to political point  scoring. Senator Chipp,  whose views on this matter I  respect, pointed yesterday to the dangers of ignoring and  distorting the facts and their causes in a speech which I

commend to all Members. My purpose here today is to place  in perspective the facts and implications of the  Government's Immigration Policy.

,v V ' f ,  Â· " Â·  " V Â· .  Â· ' ' Â·Ã¢ÂÂ -Ã¢ÂÂ 'Â·, -

On coming to Office,  the Labor Government took the view that  at a time of high unemployment, unprecedented in the  post-war era, we should reduce the total migration intake. We decided in particular to curtail drastically recruiting

for the Australian workforce. I believe that that decision  was correct.

As the same time, we acknowledged the aspirations of new  settlers in our community to reunite with their families, by  allowing an increased component for family reunion. We also  accepted our responsibilities to the international community

and our moral obligation as a participant in the Vietnam war  to continue the bipartisan humanitarian policy of accepting  refugees, particularly from Indo-China.  t

It is worth pointing out, as I said in this place on 8 May,"  that the Australian Labor Party in opposition wholeheartedly  supported the Fraser Government's efforts in offering  Indo-Chinese refugees a new life in this country,   notwithstanding our Party's strong opposition to the war

itself. Inevitably, Australia's bipartisan acceptance of  Asian refugees has carried with it bipartisan acceptance of  their right to participate equitably in the Family Reunion

Program. As Senator Chipp has said, it is inconceivable  that we could accept refugees in the late 1970's and refuse  their families in the 1980's .

This Government is not going to designate any group of  Australians as second class citizens. We are simply not going to tell people who are here legitimately, in .this______ country that they have second class rights, that they are  not allowed to exercise their rights under the Family  Reunion Program.

When the intake of Indo-Chinese refugees was at its highest  under the previous Government in the period 1979 to 1981, we  as an Opposition responsibly and constructively sought to  make no political capital out of that fact. There is some

irony in the fact that now, when the absolute number of  Indo-Chinese refugees - and indeed the total number of  Asians - coming into Australia is dropping, we find  ourselves being subjected to criticism from some quarters

for allegedly contributing to the "Asianisation" of  Australia.

The leader of the Opposition has in this place and in  statements to the media indicated that he is not opposed to  the present number of Asians coming into Australia. Indeed  he said on "Nationwide" on 8 May that the "right number" of

Asians was now coming in. He has, however,  expressed  concern,  about the "mix" or the "balance",  as he put it, of  the present migrant intake and has called for an increase in

European migration.

The fact is that the proportion of settlers (excluding  refugees) coming to Australia from Europe,  the UK and  Ireland is still higher than from any other area. In the  nine months to 31 March 1984, migration visas issued to  people from that area constituted some 43 per cent of the  total number granted.

This high proportion of visas issued has occurred despite a  diminution of migrant applications from that region and  repudiates claims of anti-British bias or anti-European bias  in our Migration Program. In the same nine months, 39.5 per

cent of total migrant applications came from Britain and  Europe compared to 44.4 per cent for 1982/83, 63.1 per cent  in 1981/82 and 66.6 per cent in 1980/81.

European migration posts have been recently asked by the *   Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs to offer  explanations for the diminution in interest in migration to  Australia from Europe. In the case of Britain, for example,   migration applications have declined dramatically - from

over 130,000 in 1980/81 to some 13,000 in the first nine  months of this financial year.

The post in London attributes particular importance in this  decline to publicity given in Britain to the recession in  Australia, the unemployment situation in 1982 and,  especially, unemployment among British migrants. It may  well be that as the improving economic circumstances here  become more widely known in Europe this situation will turn

around. ______

One can imagine, Mr Speaker, the impact in Britain of  reports of steel workers,  recruited for BMP under the former  Government's Employer Nominations Program, being sacked

within months of their arrival in this country. Nothing  could be better calculated to have a long-term negative  impact on migration from Britain.

At the same time, while the absolute number of Asians now  coming to Australia is declining because of the lower target  which the Government has set for refugees, their percentage  share of the intake is increasing. This partly reflects the  decline in interest from Europe to which I have referred.

More relevantly, since the Opposition has raised the issue  of alleged distortions in the "balance" or "mix" of the  migration program,  the percentage increase of Asian

migration also reflects the fact that the Opposition during  its final year in Government reduced the total migration  intake at a much faster rate than the refugee intake.

In that year,  it reduced its migration intake by 21 per cent  from 118,000 to 93,000. Yet at the same time, it reduced  the Asian refugee intake by only 12 per cent, from 14,557 to  12,758. We did not then,  nor do we now, criticise them for  that decision.

By contrast under the Labor Government,  the reduction in the  overall migration program has been closely paralleled by  that in the Asian refugee intake.

The point that I wish to emphasise is that in Government the  Opposition had no particular regard for the so-called  "balance" or "mix" it is now promoting as a policy  objective. Not only that, the number of Asian refugees  included in the overall intake during the period that the

Opposition was in Government is now being strongly reflected  in the family reunion program. There are ample grounds  therefore for suggesting that the Opposition's stand on this  issue smacks of hypocrisy.

For my own part, as I said on "Nationwide" on 8 ;  May, I do  not believe that one can honestly say that there is an #

immutably right figure for any migrant group within the  overall intake. Rather the approach of the Labor Government  reflects the application of economic criteria in determining  the total intake and of economic and humanitarian factors in  breaking down this total among different categories of  migrants.

This Government does not consider that a "balance" or "mix"  in our migration program determined on racial grounds can  have any place in our.society. It categorically rejects the  discriminatory concept of quotas, which is implicit in what

the Leader of the Opposition has said in recent days about  increasing the number of European migrants. It also categorically rejects jany proposal ^to introduce covert__ ___ discrimination through" differential standards in selection

criteria. Â·

We of course acknowledge the need to ensure that our  migration program does not threaten the stability and fabric  of Australian society. But in working towards this end the  Government considers that not only is the size and

composition of our intake important,  but also the programs  within our community to promote the integration of migrants  into our society from initial concentrations of ethnic  groups,  and the broader promotion of racial tolerance in our

country.

In the past few days, the Leader of the Opposition has  supported his criticism of the Government's Immigration  Policy by reference to statistics which he describes as  official Government statistics. The basis for his claims

has caused some puzzlement to the Government because my  colleague, the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs,   has received no request from the Opposition for up-to-date  immigration statistics.

Enquiries have now revealed that some figures were in fact  obtained by the Hon.  Member for Mitchell directly from a  junior officer in the Department of Immigration and Ethnic  Affairs.

The Department has now had these figures re-checked because  they do not square with other statistics available to the  Government. Our figures - figures confirmed and released  yesterday by the Minister - showed that overall migration  applications from Europe are in decline. The Opposition's  figures purported to show that family reunion applications

from Europe were increasing against this trend.

It emerges that the Opposition's figures are in fact wrong  and that even these figures have been used in a  statistically unsound manner. My colleague, Mr West, has

today written to the Hon. Member for Mitchell pointing out  this error and giving him revised figures which confirm the  Government's consistent advice that the trend of family  reunion applications to migrate to Australia from

traditional sources in Europe is in fact declining.

The Secretary of the Department of Immigration and Ethnic  Affairs, Mr McKinnon, has also provided the Minister with  statistical and other material which clarifies the factual  basis on family reunion and the trend in Australia's

Immigration Program. Furthermore, it sets out in some  detail the highly dubious fashion in which these incorrect  statistics were used by the Opposition.

Mr McKinnon said:

''MIGRANT APPLICATION STATISTICS

You asked me to explain the apparent conflict in______ applications ’  for '  family reunion in European posts  as used by Mr Cadman in the Adjournment Debate on 7  May 1984 with the advice given to you related to  the decline in interest from traditional countries  of migration.

Mr Cadman's office approached the Department direct  by telephone. The figures supplied are derived  from the Migration Program Management System. They  comprise recorded applications for family migration  by class, by country of last residence for 1982/83

and the first half of financial year 1983/84. Mr  Cjadman then doubled the half-year figures to  produce an annual rate which he compared with the  1982/83 figures.

On the basis of this comparison, he concluded that  there was an increase in family migration  applications in the United Kingdom and Europe.

A number of qualifications need to be made:

1. The figures are wrong. The data included in  MPM5, which is still being developed, are  notoriously unreliable. They depend upon input  from a number of posts using a number of  classification methods. When supplying such

figures,  a caveat is normally included which draws  attention to their limitations, but on this  occasion the caveat was not included.

A complete re-run of the figures,  including  recourse to the basic data, has been undertakenÃ¢ÂÂ   The revised results are attached. You will note  that they considerably alter the picture portrayed  by Mr Cadman.

2. The figures are seasonal and should not be  treated by doubling a half-year figure.  Applications in European posts are seasonal. An  example using U.K. figures for total number of  persons covered by applications shows:

July-December 1980 46 304

January-June 1981 77 854

July-December 1981 43 883

January-June 1982 60 317

July-December 1982 29 357

January-June 1983 22 766

7hÂ¥s”a'’llbljVlTnlg~0''f"“Â£He figures for July-Dee ember in  any category runs the risk of grossly under or  over-estimating the annual rate.

3. The series is not consistent. A higher

proportion of persons applying in European posts  have been applying under family reunion as the  opportunities for skilled migration,  which does not  depend upon sponsorship, have declined. As the  occupational Demand Schedule has narrowed, persons

who would normally have applied otherwise are now  applying under family reunion. I

Furthermore, the increase in the scope of family  reunion to include Category C only commenced in the  first half of 1982 and the influence of this  widened eligibility would have been felt

increasingly through the period used by Mr Cadman .

4. The data are not complete. One of the other

indications of declining interest in migration is  the number of persons put into processing who do  not respond to an invitation to interview. For

example,  the current response rate in the Athens

post is as low as 50%, which indicates that about  half of the people being sponsored by relatives in  Australia are not interested in migration. Although the non-response rates for other European  posts are not as high,  they are still significant  and well above the equivalent rates for Asian  posts.

I should point out that the figures for  applications relate to actual arrivals  approximately one year later. Thus,  even if family

reunion interest were to be regenerating in .   traditional migration countries (which is contrary  to the advice from virtually all our posts), this  would not be reflected in current arrivals figures.

The current figures on the balance of source  countries for arrivals would reflect the  applications in 1982/83 at the latest, before any  changes in immigration policy of the current  Government became operative.

In any case, I should point out that the only  changes made since the change of Government affect  the family reunion Category C. This represented  less than one quarter of all family reunion

arrivals in 1982/83. Thus the changes introduced  in the Points Assessment System will change  marginally the proportion from different sources in  future arrivals. _  , ___; _______. __ _____

I w o u l d  like to give you my unqualified assurance  that no policy or operational instructions have  been promulgated which would inhibit migration from  traditional source countries. You would be aware

that special efforts have been made to lift the  number of Category C family reunion migrants once  the shortfall became evident. Furthermore, with  the declining overall level of applications in

these countries,  we have been able to improve  significantly our processing times for family  reunion migrants particularly from those countries.

I '  '  '

For example, for the United Kingdom the average time between receipt of the application (M47) to  the approval letter is now approximately 3^ months,   compared to 9-11 months two years ago. It is now  one of the shortest periods anywhere in the world.

I believe that Mr Cadman should be informed of the  adjusted figures and the limitations on the use of  the figures in measuring interest in family  reunion.”

I seek leave,  Mr Speaker,  to incorporate a number of  supporting tables, provided to the Minister by Mr McKinnon.

I make the further point that the Opposition made no effort  to consult the Minister before obtaining the figures. Having obtained them, it made no attempt to discuss the  matter with the Minister,  notwithstanding the Government's .

citation of other statistics which argued a contrary trend.   Given the sensitivity of these issues, one might have  expected a little extra care to be shown,  a little more time  to be spent, a little more effort to be invested, before  bipartisanship and national consensus were put at risk by  public political attacks based on false premises.

Put simply, the Opposition's case is based uponiinaccurate  statistics, improperly used.  It has at its heart the false *  allegation that the Government has somehow sought to deter  migration from Europe. Mr McKinnon's statement refutes that

allegation - if it ever needed to be refuted - when he  says, and I repeat:

"I would like to give you my unqualified assurance  that no policy or operational instructions have  been promulgated which would inhibit migration from  traditional source countries."

For several days now, the Opposition has vilified my  colleague, the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs,   who has steadfastly and honestly set out the facts to this

House regarding the trend in Australia's migration flow.

He has been completely vindicated by the information  released today.

The Government has throughout emphasised the importance of a  bipartisan position on this crucial issue. For its part,  the Opposition has paid lip service to the concept of  biparisanship.but claims that it no longer exists as a

result of Government policies.

It is not enough for the Opposition to assert that it seeks  bipartisanship and then by its behaviour to undermine it. The Opposition's behaviour in this place in recent days has  diminished the dignity, decorum and reason which ought to  surround this issue.

As the Sydney Morning Herald said this morning:

"The Opposition's claim that the Government has  departed from bipartisan immigration policy by  running a "pro-Asian and anti-British" policy is nonsense .....  it is the Opposition and not the

Government that is seeking to depart from  bipartisan policy ....... it seems that Mr Peacock

does not want a constructive debate. The  Opposition just wants to make a quick killing".

It is not too late to restore decency and commonsense to  discussion of this issue. At this point,  Mr Speaker,  I  repeat the call which I made to the Leader of the Opposition  in the House on 8 May to put an end to this debate as a

party political dispute and in particular to dampen down the "X  racial overtones which it can so easily assume.  I said that  it would be to the great service of this country and all its

citizens, and to our relations with countries in this area,   if we did not allow this very dangerous issue to be raised  and to become something that is in the forefront of  political debate.

As Senator Chipp said in the statement to which I referred  earlier, the rhetoric which is surrounding the debate does  not match the facts and the danger is that the consequences  of the rhetoric will be to fan those underground elements o/

racism and prejudice.

A bipartisan policy in this area is of crucial national  importance - splitting the debate along political and  partisan lines would only serve to cause wholly undesirable  divisions within our society.

Is there anyone in this place who wants to see  discrimination reintroduced into our Immigration Policies,  with all the tragic social damage and conflict which that  would bring to this great country? Does anyone here want to  see Australia turn its back on those in our region who have

known -  anguish and human.suffering? Do we want to see Australia lose its reputation as a tolerant, open-hearted-------country, which can hold its head high in the world?

I know where the Government stands on this matter. I would  like to believe that the Opposition stands with us.
