THE HON JOE HOCKEY MP

SHADOW TREASURER

SUNRISE - BIG GUNS OF POLITICS   CHANNEL 7  FRIDAY, 28 JUNE 2013



E&OE…………………………………………………………………………………

PRESENTER:

Let's check in with our Big Guns of Politics, and we welcome new Treasurer Chris Bowen  and Shadow Treasurer Joe Hockey. Good morning to you both. Chris, welcome. With a close  two-party preferred figure and Kevin the preferred PM are you going to bring on a snap  election? Is it going to be sooner rather than later?



CHRIS BOWEN:

Well, the first point to make, Kochie, is that this election is close and competitive again. If  the Liberal Party were measuring up the curtains and checking out the lounge suites in the  ministerial offices and taking things for granted there is a tight election now. The Australian  people have a really tough and close election now on their hands. We will be fighting for it  very, very hard and we’ll be putting our case very hard in the election. In terms of the  election timing; as the Prime Minister said yesterday in Parliament, he will be applying the  normal and traditional constitutional convention, which is, that he will think about an election  date. He will then go and talk to the Governor-General. After he has spoken to the Governor-General and she agreed to the election date, then he will announce it.

PRESENTER:

Joe, you guys were home and hosed. This changes things. Be honest, is the Coalition  worried?

JOE HOCKEY:

We are always concerned about how we can win an election. But most importantly, we are  more concerned about the Australian people. Our focus is on good policy and nothing the  polls or nothing that happens in the Labor Party is going to change that. We are focused on  the Australian people. What we've seen over the last 48 hours is a circus up here - the place  has turned into Barnum and Bailey's circus. It is a joke. Kevin Rudd was on this program last

week saying there were no circumstances upon which he would become leader of the Labor  Party and then this week he knifed Julia Gillard. Come on! It is enough. The circus has got to  come to an end. The Australian people should decide who the Prime Minister and the  Government is. Let's have an election, and have it now.

PRESENTER:

Speaking of policies and focusing back on that.  News Ltd this morning is reporting that  Kevin Rudd is pushing to axe the controversial carbon tax. Joe, you have got to be pleased  with that. You said the carbon tax is a problem. You said asylum seekers are a problem - turn  back the boats. This is a good step forward by Kevin Rudd, isn’t it?

JOE HOCKEY:

There are two things that need to be noted about this. Number one, even as late as last night  Chris Bowen - who is on this program - was saying that the carbon tax is working well. He  and Kevin, the day before yesterday, voted for the carbon tax to increase next Monday by  5%. The second thing is whether it is a fixed carbon tax or a floating carbon tax, it is still a  carbon tax. The fact that they say they are going to abolish it means they are going to have a  black hole of up to $15 billion in the Budget. The leaks out of today's papers suggest this mob  is going to go on a spending spree that brings back the credit card on a scale that even Kevin  is incapable of meeting, but he is going to give it a good shot. He is going to smoke the  Australian credit card and not worry about what the impact is after the election.

PRESENTER:

Treasurer, can you clear this up for us? Are you going to dump the carbon tax?

CHRIS BOWEN:

No. We just heard that normal negative line from Joe which we hear a lot these days. But in  relation to the carbon price, he is dead right about what I said last night. I said it again this  morning. The carbon price is in - it is the law. It’s been taken through the Parliament. It does  go to a floating price in the future. That makes it a market price. That is something both the  Labor Party and the Liberal Party used to both agree on and the Liberal Party did a flip and  changed their position. But the carbon price is in - we are seeing emissions coming down. We  see our economy still growing and jobs being created. If you are asking us on day two - if  you are asking Kevin Rudd and Chris Bowen, the new Prime Minister and Treasurer to say  we are never going to change any government policies or we are never going to discuss any  change to government policy in the future, well we are not going to do that today, and you  know that is a silly point

JOE HOCKEY:

You will do it tomorrow!

CHRIS BOWEN:

You know that is a silly point for you to be making Joe. You have got a new Prime Minister  who is being briefed on a whole range of issues, as is always the case, but the carbon price is  in, implemented and the law of the land.

JOE HOCKEY:

This is a whole new government, it is amazing. There’s nothing that has happened over the  past six years - it is a brand-new team. There was no Kevin Rudd before - it’s an all new  Kevin!

CHRIS BOWEN:

What happened yesterday Joe? You are going on about how it is terrible to change leaders.  Well, Kevin Rudd has faced John Howard, Brendan Nelson Malcolm Turnbull and Tony  Abbott.

JOE HOCKEY:

Hang on! They weren't Prime Ministers!

CHRIS BOWEN:

You had a go Joe, and you lost the leadership by one vote. It is what happens.

JOE HOCKEY:

Just run of the mill.

CHRIS BOWEN:

Yesterday, a new Prime Minister was commissioned by the Governor-General, calmly. There  was no constitutional crisis, despite all the hoopla and how terrible it was going to be and the  Government was going to collapse and the nation …

JOE HOCKEY:

A third of the Cabinet has resigned. No problems.

CHRIS BOWEN:

And the nation was going to stop. And what happened? There was a handover to Kevin Rudd.  The Governor-General commissioned him. He is being briefed on a whole range of issues,  that is what happens when a Prime Minister changes. It happens smoothly and methodically.

JOE HOCKEY:

Fantastic.

CHRIS BOWEN:

Now Kevin Rudd has a tough choice to choose between lots of very talented members of  Parliament and he is working through the construction of his Cabinet.

JOE HOCKEY:

This is fantastic…

PRESENTER:

No need to filibuster. Joe?

JOE HOCKEY:

There’s no train wreck here. Move on, no train crash, everything is going really well. A third  of the cabinet has resigned. We just knifed another Prime Minister. We are about to change  all our policies but don’t worry everything is going well here. Move on, there is no incident.  Fair dinkum, come on! This is a joke. It is a bad joke, but the Australian people are paying a  price. That's the problem.

CHRIS BOWEN:

The fact is, Joe, you and I are going to be debating economics. I am happy to debate you in  the election campaign.

JOE HOCKEY:

Anytime!

CHRIS BOWEN:

Talk about the issues. Let’s talk about the issues.

JOE HOCKEY:

Give us an election, come on. Let’s talk about your funding black hole. Let’s talk about our  positive policies for the future and how the Australian economy is performing compared to  the rest of the world. Let’s talk about the growth. Let’s talk about our debt levels, let's have  the debates.

PRESENTER:

[Inaudible] We have going to have plenty of time for this over the next 78 days.

PRESENTER 2:

We might organise an organised debate on the economy between you two. Let’s do that. Are  you up for it? Would you do it?

CHRIS BOWEN:

We'll be there. Absolutely.

JOE HOCKEY:

You know what? I thought Kevin Rudd could talk, but this guy is giving it a good shot. It is  meant to be morning TV. We are meant to wake them up, not send them back to sleep.

CHRIS BOWEN:

And you are a shrinking violet Joe. You are famous for it. You are a famous shrinking violet.

PRESENTER:

I am looking forward to this. The debate is on.

JOE HOCKEY:

So am I.

PRESENTER:

Thank you.
