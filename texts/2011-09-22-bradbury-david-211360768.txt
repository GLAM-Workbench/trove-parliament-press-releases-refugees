INTERVIEW WITH WENDY KINGSTON

CHANNEL NINE MORNING NEWS

22 SEPTEMBER 2011

SUBJECTS: Minister for Foreign Affairs, amendments to the  Migration Act

WENDY KINGSTON:

We're joined live now by Parliamentary Secretary David Bradbury. Mr  Bradbury, thank you for your time. First of all, is Kevin Rudd spending  more than necessary?

DAVID BRADBURY:

Good morning Wendy, good to be with you. I think, Wendy, that most  Australians would understand the Foreign Minister has a role that requires  him to travel around the world - that's an important part of the duties that  he has to carry out. But I think equally that most Australians would take  the view that when it comes to travel expenses, we should be doing what  we can to minimise those expenses, to make sure they're always  reasonable and I think that they're the positions that really are at stake in  terms of issues that have been raised around this question today.

KINGSTON:

So how routine are these kinds of requests from the PM's office and have  you ever had one?

BRADBURY:

Well I haven't done a lot of overseas travel in my portfolio responsibilities,  but it is very much in the ordinary course of things for correspondence of

this sort to occur just to remind Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries  that if they're undertaking this kind of travel that they should be conscious.  I think that the public would expect that we be conscious of the costs  associated with that travel. That doesn't necessarily mean not undertaking  trips that are important but it certainly means being mindful of that  expense and I think that is entirely appropriate and to be honest,  unexceptional.

KINGSTON:

On the topic of Kevin Rudd, has he called you at all to talk about the Labor  Party leadership?

BRADBURY:

No.

KINGSTON:

No not yet? Because your colleague Shayne Neumann did. No?

BRADBURY:

I haven't received a call to that effect and I've got to tell you Wendy that I  haven't heard of any of my colleagues receiving a call to that effect. I know  that people have mentioned Shayne Neumann's answers earlier today. I've  spoken to Shayne and Shayne simply said that he was simply going to  answer the question the way he wanted it, not the way other people  wanted it. He confirmed to me that he's not received any such call either.  Look, I've seen some of these reports in the newspaper and frankly I find it  curious that we're now talking about a story that emerged because of  anonymous allegations from Liberal Party sources. You would expect the  Liberal Party to try and drum up mischief in this area, but I think that it's  peculiar that we're not just talking about Liberal Party but anonymous  Liberal Party sources. I've not heard any of this talk and I think it's a beat  up.

KINGSTON:

Okay and just on the topic quickly, the Opposition has introduced its  amendments now to the Migration Act for offshore processing, is there any  chance at all that the Government will consider them?

BRADBURY:

Well we believe it is important for the Government to have the powers that  it needs to put in place an effective border protection set of policies.  Frankly, I think it is extraordinary that the Opposition is seeking to put a  handcuff, not on just this Government, but future Governments, to say  that the only deals and arrangements you can come to when you're trying  to tackle border protection challenges is with countries that are signatories  to the Convention. I saw your story a little bit earlier on about some of the  nasty activities that are happening in a place like Iran. I just want to make  the point that Iran happens to be a signatory to the Convention. So simply  putting this requirement on that you can only have offshore processing in a  country that has signed up to the Convention, that doesn't provide any  additional guarantees to human rights. What we've sought to do through  the Malaysian arrangement, through an arrangement between the  Australian and Malaysian Governments, put in place some very strong  safeguards to ensure that we have the capacity to process people offshore  but also do it in a way that respects the human rights of the individuals.

KINGSTON:

Okay David thanks very much for joining us this morning, we appreciate  your time.

BRADBURY:

Thanks Wendy.
