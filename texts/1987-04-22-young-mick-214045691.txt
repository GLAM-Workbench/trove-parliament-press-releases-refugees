ECONOMICS OF IMMIGRATION

The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Mick Young,  today opened a Conference on the Economics of Immigration.  The Conference, funded jointly by the Department of  Immigration and Ethnic Affairs and the Australian National  University, attracted speakers and participants from across

the nation and overseas.

Mr Young said that he had always been and continues to be an  advocate of immigration. "Increasingly, Australians are  accepting that immigration does not adversely affect the job  prospects of the Australian born", he said.

"The Government remains committed to increasing Australia's  self-sufficiency in the skills required for its economic  development", Mr Young said. "Therefore, skilled migration  is carefully programmed to generate benefits to the economy,  and to ensure that priority in employment is given to  workers already in Australia."

Mr Young also said that "Australians are aware of the need  to build a larger population commensurate with economic  development opportunities, demographic trends and sound  environmental management."

"Without immigration we would experience an accelerated  ageing of the population, a steep increase in welfare  payments and therefore higher taxation", said Mr Young.

"However", Mr Young added, "the Government wishes to avoid  substantial or rapid changes in migration flows, as these  create community unease, complicate Government planning and  program management at all levels."

Mr Young concluded by saying that "No one should pretend  that immigration offers a panacea or that it is the  preferred instrument in all circumstances and on all  occasions. On the other hand, the lessons of Australia's  history will show immigration has served it well and that  properly managed, carefully balanced and gradually expanded,

immigration programs will reflect that careful blending of  economic wisdom, humanitarian concern and demographic  stimulus that serves Australia's public interest."

OPENING ADDRESS BY THE HON MICK YOUNG MP, MINISTER FOR

IMMIGRATION AND ETHNIC AFFAIRS, TO THE JOINT CONFERENCE:

THE ECONOMICS OF IMMIGRATION.

I AM DELIGHTED TO OPEN THIS JOINTLY SPONSORED CONFERENCE ON

THE ECONOMICS OF IMMIGRATION.

I RECALL THAT AS OPPOSITION SPOKESMAN ON IMMIGRATION AND

ETHNIC AFFAIRS,  I PARTICIPATED IN THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE

LAST CONFERENCE OF THIS KIND IN 1982 CONVENED ALSO BY MY

DEPARTMENT AND AT THAT TIME THE UNIVERSITY OF SYDNEY. I

NOTE WITH INTEREST THAT THE A.N.U. HAS ASSEMBLED A NUMBER OF

WELL KNOWN INTERNATIONAL AND AUSTRALIAN SPEAKERS AT THIS

FORUM. IN CONSIDERING SUCH AN IMPORTANT SUBJECT I BELIEVE

IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT THERE BE A CROSS FLOW OF IDEAS AND

EXPERIENCES FROM BOTH WITHIN AUSTRALIA AND OVERSEAS.

WHEN I SPOKE IN 1982 I MADE A NUMBER OF POINTS WHICH I THINK

ARE STILL RELEVANT TODAY AND WHICH BEAR REPEATING.

THERE ARE NO ABSOLUTES IN IMMIGRATION IF ONLY BECAUSE PEOPLE

HAVE A HABIT OF DISAGREEING ABOUT THE FACTS. THEY DO SO

BECAUSE THEY GENUINELY ASCRIBE DIFFERENT VALUES TO COMPETING

OBJECTIVES

2 -

AS I SAID THEN, I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN AND CONTINUE TO BE AN

ADVOCATE OF AN IMMIGRATION INTAKE. I SAID THEN THAT WE HAD

A RESPONSIBILITY TO ADMIT REFUGEES AND FAMILY REUNION

MIGRANTS NOT MERELY ON ECONOMIC GROUNDS BUT BECAUSE OF OUR

COMMITMENT TO HUMANTARIANISM AND THE NATIONAL INTEREST.

I CAUTIONED THEN AND I STRESS NOW THAT AUSTRALIA MUST "

CONTINUE TO GIVE EQUAL EMPHASIS TO PLANNING AND DEVELOPING

ADEQUATE AND COST EFFECTIVE LABOUR FORCE PROGRAMS AND THAT

INDUSTRY, GOVERNMENT AND TRADE UNIONS MUST WORK TOGETHER TO

ENSURE THAT ALL AUSTRALIANS DEVELOP THE SKILLS WHICH AN

INCREASINGLY SOPHISTICATED LABOUR MARKET REQUIRES.  I

ACKNOWLEDGED THEN AND I ACKNOWLEDGE NOW THE CONTRIBUTION

WHICH MILLIONS OF NEW SETTLERS HAVE MADE TO THIS GREAT

COUNTRY AND I LOOK WITH CRITICAL PRIDE AT THE PROGRAMS AND

SERVICES WHICH WE HAVE PROVIDED TO FACILITATE SETTLEMENT AND

TO DEVELOP THE PRACTICAL EXPRESSION OF A MULTICULTURAL BUT

COHESIVE AUSTRALIAN SOCIETY.

WHILST THIS CONFERENCE QUITE PROPERLY HAS AN ECONOMIC FOCUS,

IMMIGRATION IS NOT THE PROVINCE OF ECONOMISTS ALONE. PEOPLE

WITH TRAINING AND KNOWLEDGE OF SOCIOLOGY AND THE SCIENCES

HAVE AN EQUAL CONTRIBUTION TO MAKE TO ANY DEBATE. COMMUNITY

GROUPS, BUSINESS AND UNIONS, FARMERS AND PHARMACISTS MUST

ALSO CONTRIBUTE

3

WHAT WE MUST DO AS A COMMUNITY AND AS A GOVERNMENT IS FIND

AND EMPHASISE THE COMMON GROUND. IN THIS REGARD,  I THINK IT

IS FAIR TO SAY THAT THERE IS MUCH MORE COMMON GROUND THAN

THERE IS DISAGREEMENT. VERY OFTEN THE DISAGREEMENTS ARISE

FROM DIFFERENT INTERPRETATIONS OF THE FACTS OR FROM VARYING

PERSPECTIVES.

INCREASINGLY, AUSTRALIANS ARE ACCEPTING THE RESEARCH FINDING

THAT IMMIGRATION DOES NOT ADVERSELY AFFECT THE JOB PROSPECTS

OF THE AUSTRALIAN BORN. THERE HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANT

EMPLOYMENT GROWTH UNDER THIS GOVERNMENT. FOR EXAMPLE,

BETWEEN APRIL 1983 AND FEBRUARY 1987, 738,100 NEW JOBS HAVE

BEEN CREATED. THIS REPRESENTS AN 11.7% GROWTH, WHICH IS THE

FASTEST RATE OF GROWTH IN EMPLOYMENT OF ANY COUNTRY IN THE

WESTERN INDUSTRIALISED WORLD OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS. THE

TOTAL NUMBER OF WAGE AND SALARY EARNERS INCREASED BY 530,500

WITH OVER 80% OF THESE BEING IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR. THE

UNEMPLOYMENT RATE HAS REDUCED FROM OVER 10% IN 1983 TO JUST

OVER 8%, WHILE THE OVERALL WORKFORCE PARTICIPATION RATE

INCREASED BY 1.3% IN THE SAME PERIOD. IT IS INTERESTING TO

NOTE THAT, IF THE PARTICIPATION RATE HAD NOT INCREASED BY

1.3%, THEN THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE WOULD NOW STAND AT 6.3%.

THIS IS NOT TO SAY THAT THERE WILL NOT BE POCKETS OF

UNEMPLOYED PEOPLE DISADVANTAGED BY THE COMPETITION GENERATED

BY SOME IMMIGRANTS. OUR EXPERIENCE IS THAT IMMIGRANTS ARE

FOR THE MOST PART HIGHLY MOTIVATED TO ECONOMIC SUCCESS AND

THE ADVANCEMENT OF THEIR CHILDREN. CONVERSELY, IMMIGRANTS

BY AND LARGE WILL ONLY ENJOY EQUAL ACCESS AND OPPORTUNITIES

IN THE LABOUR MARKET AS THEY ATTAIN ENGLISH LANGUAGE

PROFICIENCY, QUALIFICATIONS RECOGNITION AND/OR EQUIVALENT

KNOWLEDGE OF THE INDUSTRIES IN WHICH THEY WORK OR SEEK TO

WORK. AGAIN, THIS IS NOT TO SAY THAT THERE ARE NO BARRIERS

OR OBSTACLES TO ENTRY FOR ALL MIGRANTS IN ALL CIRCUMSTANCES.

BREAKING DOWN THOSE BARRIERS IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF ALL

AUSTRALIANS.

HOWEVER, AT THE SAME TIME, THE GOVERNMENT REMAINS COMMITTED

TO INCREASING AUSTRALIA'S SELF-SUFFICIENCY IN THE SKILLS

REQUIRED FOR ITS ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. THEREFORE, SKILLED

MIGRATION IS CAREFULLY PROGRAMMED TO GENERATE BENEFITS TO

THE ECONOMY, AND TO ENSURE THAT PRIORITY IN EMPLOYMENT IS

GIVEN TO WORKERS ALREADY IN AUSTRALIA

S

LATE LAST YEAR, THE GOVERNMENT RECEIVED A REPORT ON THE

OCCUPATIONAL SHARE SYSTEM FOR SKILLED MIGRATION. THIS

SYSTEM DETERMINES THE NUMBERS OF SKILLED IMMIGRANTS REQUIRED

AND THE DEPARTMENTS OF EMPLOYMENT AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS

AND IMMIGRATION,AND ETHNIC AFFAIRS WORK CLOSELY WITH THE

ACTU IN IDENTIFYING SHORTFALLS AND SETTING PRIORITIES FOR

REDRESSING THEM. CONSEQUENTLY, OCCUPATIONAL SHARES ARE

ALLOCATED ONLY IN OCCUPATIONS WHERE DOMESTIC EDUCATION,

TRAINING AND RETRAINING ARE UNLIKELY TO SATISFY REQUIREMENTS

FOR SKILLS OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS. ON THE OTHER HAND, ONLY

EXPERIENCED AND FULLY QUALIFIED WORKERS WILL BE ALLOWED

ENTRY UNDER THE OCCUPATIONAL SHARE SYSTEM.

THE REPORT, ENTITLED "MEETING AUSTRALIA'S SKILL NEEDS"

RECOMMENDED THAT UP TO 3,950 WORKERS IN 26 OCCUPATIONS BE

GRANTED ENTRY UNDER THE ARRANGEMENTS IN 1986/87. THIS

REPRESENTS AN INCREASE OF 450 OVER LAST YEAR'S LEVEL, BUT

THE CONTINUING STRONG DEMAND FOR HIGH-LEVEL SKILLS IN

CERTAIN OCCUPATIONS JUSTIFIES THIS INCREASE. FOR EXAMPLE,

SHORTAGES CONTINUE TO BE EVIDENT IN KEY OCCUPATIONS SUCH AS

NURSING, COMPUTING, AND ELECTRONIC AND INDUSTRIAL

ENGINEERING. .

WITH IMPROVEMENTS IN OUR PLANNING AND THE RESPONSE OF OUR

EDUCATION AND TRAINING INSTITUTIONS, OUR AIM IS TO

PROGRESSIVELY REDUCE RELIANCE ON OVERSEAS SKILLED WORKERS.

WHILE IT CANNOT BE DENIED THAT CONTINUING ACTION IS REQUIRED

BY OUR EDUCATION AND TRAINING INSTITUTIONS, AS WELL AS

EMPLOYERS AND TRADE UNIONS, TO MEET FUTURE REQUIREMENTS FOR

LABOUR MARKET SKILLS, WE CAN RECORD SOME SIGNIFICANT

ACHIEVEMENT IN THIS AREA ALREADY.

FOR EXAMPLE, STRONG ECONOMIC GROWTH OVER THE PAST THREE

YEARS, COMBINED WITH FEDERAL INITIATIVES IN THE TRADE AREA,

HAS UNDERPINNED AN INCREASE OF ALMOST 50% IN THE

APPRENTICESHIP INTAKES SINCE THE DOWNTURN OF 1982-83.

OVERALL, GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE ON LABOUR MARKET PROGRAMS

AND SERVICES HAS RISEN BY A MASSIVE 98% SINCE 1983. MAIN

RESPONSES THIS FINANCIAL YEAR IN THE TRAINING AREA HAVE

INCLUDED FUNDING BOOSTS OF 47.5% FOR THE ADULT TRAINING

PROGRAM AND 84.5% FOR THE COMMUNITY TRAINING PROGRAM.

IN ADDITION, THE AUSTRALIAN TRAINEESHIP SYSTEM IS GRADUALLY

BEING INTRODUCED AS A MAJOR NEW VOCATIONAL TRAINING SYSTEM

FOR YOUNG PEOPLE IN THE NON-TRADES AREAS OF THE WORKFORCE.

AS AT MARCH 1987, SOME 89 TRAINING/INDUSTRIAL AGREEMENTS

WERE CONCLUDED IN A WIDE RANGE OF INDUSTRIES/OCCUPATIONS, IN

BOTH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTORS. OVER 9,000 TRAINEESHIP

OPPORTUNITIES HAVE BEEN CREATED, AND AROUND 1,300 EMPLOYERS

IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR ARE PARTICIPATING IN THE SCHEME.

WE ARE ALSO CONCERNED TO IMPROVE OUR SKILLS BASE AND

INTERNATIONAL COMPETITIVENESS THROUGH IMPROVED VOCATIONAL

TRAINING FOR INDIVIDUALS, COMPREHENSIVE PACKAGES OF

ASSISTANCE TO KEY INDUSTRIES AND INDUSTRIAL REGIONS AND

THEIR WORKFORCES TO RESTRUCTURE AND RETRAIN, AND A

SIGNIFICANT STRENGTHENING OF TRIPARTITE INVOLVEMENT IN

LABOUR MARKET POLICY ADVICE TO THE GOVERNMENT THROUGH THE

ESTABLISHMENT OF THE AUSTRALIA COUNCIL FOR EMPLOYMENT AND

TRAINING.

THE GOVERNMENT ALSO PLACES SPECIAL EMPHASIS ON AN EFFECTIVE

PROGRAM OF PROVIDING ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNING IN THE

WORKPLACE. IN RECENT YEARS, THE GOVERNMENT HAS FUNDED BOTH

LONGER COURSES AND INCREASED NUMBERS OF PARTICIPANTS - WE

NOW HAVE ABOUT 6,000 ENROLMENTS IN INDUSTRY-BASED COURSES.

THE GOVERNMENT'S ACCESS AND EQUITY POLICIES AND PROGRAMS

CONTINUE TO ADDRESS THE SPECIAL DISABILITIES FACED BY NEW

SETTLERS AND THEIR DEPENDENTS IN MAXIMISING THEIR POTENTIAL

CONTRIBUTION TO THE AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY AND AUSTRALIAN

SOCIETY. IT IS IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST THAT EVERY AUSTRALIAN

APPRECIATES THE REWARDS OF EQUALITY OF OPPORTUNITY.

PROGRESSIVELY, AUSTRALIANS ARE AWARE OF THE NEED TO BUILD A

LARGER POPULATION COMMENSURATE WITH ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT

OPPORTUNITIES, DEMOGRAPHIC TRENDS AND SOUND ENVIRONMENTAL

MANAGEMENT.

ÃÂµ

AUSTRALIANS WISH TO REMAIN FREE TO CHOOSE WHETHER AND WHEN

THEY MARRY AND HAVE CHILDREN. AUSTRALIANS ARE CHOOSING TO

HAVE CHILDREN AT A RATE SOME 10% BELOW THE LONG TERM

REPLACEMENT LEVEL. WITHOUT IMMIGRATION THIS TREND WILL LEAD

TO ACCELERATED AGEING OF THE POPULATION, A STEEP INCREASE IN

WELFARE PAYMENTS AND THEREFORE HIGHER TAXATION. THE PROBLEM

IS NOT SERIOUS YET BUT WILL CONFRONT US EARLY NEXT CENTURY

IF LEFT UNRESOLVED. MOST AUSTRALIANS ARE SUFFICIENTLY

ALERTED.TO THIS REAL POTENTIAL TO ACCEPT OR FAVOUR THE

IMMIGRATION OF YOUNG, SELF-SUFFICIENT AND MOTIVATED

MIGRANTS, AND TO RECOGNISE THE CONTRIBUTION THIS WILL MAKE

TO RETARDING THE AGEING PROCESS.

THIS GOVERNMENT HAS EXPANDED IMMIGRATION IN A MODEST,

CONTROLLED AND MANAGEABLE WAY. IT HAS DONE SO WITH

SUBSTANTIAL COMMUNITY SUPPORT AND GOODWILL AT A TIME OF

HISTORICALLY HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT AND ECONOMIC VOLATILITY. IN

THE PROCESS, IMMIGRATION'S CONTRIBUTION TO POPULATION GROWTH

HAS INCREASED. INDEED, THIS GOVERNMENT HAS ACHIEVED A Â·

SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE PROPORTION OF THE TOTAL

MIGRATION STREAM WHICH CAN BE DESCRIBED AS PROFESSIONAL,

TECHNICAL AND SKILLED WORKERS. FOR EXAMPLE, IN 1986 ALMOST

41% OF NET PERMANENT AND LONG TERM GAIN BELONGED TO THESE

SKILLED AND HIGHLY SKILLED COMPONENTS.  ACCORDINGLY,

MIGRATION CONTRIBUTES TO RAISING THE SKILL AND EDUCATION

PROFILE OF THE AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY.

I AM AWARE THAT MANY IN THE IMMIGRATION ARENA CONFUSE TWO

VERY DIFFERENT CONCEPTS OF SKILL. AS I HAVE ALREADY

OUTLINED, THE GOVERNMENT HAS AN OCCUPATIONAL SHARE SYSTEM.

IN ADDITION, THERE IS AN EMPLOYMENT NOMINATION SCHEME.

TOGETHER THEY ARE DESIGNED TO PLUG THEMSELVES TO THE

SUBSTANTIAL LEAD TIMES NECESSARILY INVOLVED IN TRAINING

PROGRAMS.

THESE PROGRAMS SHOULD NOT IN ANY WAY BE CONFUSED WITH THE

BROADER OBJECTIVE OF HAVING AS ONE ARM OF IMMIGRATION POLICY

THE DIVERSIFICATION AND ENRICHMENT OF THE SKILL COMPONENT OF

AUSTRALIA'S LABOUR MARKET. FROM THIS WIDER, MORE MACRO

PERSPECTIVE, THE OBJECTIVE OF BUILDING A MORE SKILLED, MORE

TECHNOLOGY ADEPT WORK FORCE IS A CHALLENGE WHICH AUSTRALIAN

INDUSTRY, GOVERNMENT AND TRADE UNIONS CONFRONT IN

PARTNERSHIP. WHAT WE SEEK TO DO AS A GOVERNMENT IS ENSURE

THAT WE OPTIMISE THE SKILL LEVEL OF MOST OF THE MIGRATION

CATEGORIES WHILST GIVING GREAT WEIGHT TO FAMILY REUNION,

HUMANITARIAN CRITERIA AND NATION BUILDING.

FOR ALL THESE REASONS, THE GOVERNMENT WISHES TO AVOID

SUBSTANTIAL OR RAPID CHANGES IN MIGRATION FLOWS FROM YEAR TO

YEAR. RAPID OR MAJOR CHANGES TO IMMIGRATION INTAKES CREATE

COMMUNITY UNEASE, COMPLICATE GOVERNMENT PLANNING AND PROGRAM

MANAGEMENT AT ALL LEVELS AND INVOLVE DISLOCATION TO THE

fo

ADMINISTRATION OF MY DEPARTMENT WITH CONSEQUENCES FOR OUR

CLIENTS.

WHATEVER CONSENSUS THERE IS ABOUT THE ECONOMICS OF

IMMIGRATION, WE KNOW THAT MOST OF THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL

COSTS OF AN IMMIGRATION PROGRAM ARE BORNE IN THE SHORT RUN

PREDOMINANTLY BY THE PUBLIC SECTOR AND THE MIGRANTS

THEMSELVES. MOST OF THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL BENEFITS ACCRUE

TO THE MIGRANTS AND THE COMMUNITY AT LARGE IN THE MEDIUM TO

LONGER TERM.

ANY MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION MUST, AMONG OTHER THINGS,

BALANCE THESE DIFFERENT TIME DIMENSIONS. EQUALLY, IN

ADDRESSING A LONG TERM RATIONALE AND FRAMEWORK FOR

IMMIGRATION, GOVERNMENTS BUSINESS AND TRADE UNIONS WILL

INCREASINGLY LOOK AT THE LONGER TERM ROLES OF EDUCATION,

TRAINING, ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT AND INDUSTRY POLICY

IMPLICIT IN AUSTRALIA'S LONG TERM OUTLOOK.

THERE IS LITTLE ARGUMENT THAT AUSTRALIA IS UNDERPOPULATED BY

ANY GLOBAL TEST AND BY MOST DOMESTIC MEASURES. THERE CAN BE

NO ARGUMENT THAT OUR POPULATION IS AGEING AND THAT THIS WILL

HAVE SIGNIFICANT IMPLICATIONS FOR GOVERNMENT HEALTH AND

WELFARE OUTLAYS. THERE WILL CONTINUE TO BE DEBATES ABOUT

THE CHOICE OF POLICY INSTRUMENTS AVAILABLE TO GOVERNMENT TO

ADDRESS STRUCTURAL DEFICIENCIES, LABOUR MARKET PROBLEMS AND

TECHNOLOGICAL CHALLENGES FACING AUSTRALIA.

/ {

NO ONE SHOULD PRETEND THAT IMMIGRATION OFFERS A PANACEA OR

THAT IT IS THE PREFERRED POLICY INSTRUMENT IN ALL

CIRCUMSTANCES AND ON ALL OCCASIONS. ON THE OTHER HAND, THE

LESSONS OF AUSTRALIA'S HISTORY WILL SHOW IMMIGRATION HAS

SERVED IT WELL AND THAT PROPERLY MANAGED, CAREFULLY BALANCED

AND GRADUALLY EXPANDED, IMMIGRATION PROGRAMS WILL REFLECT

THAT CAREFUL BLENDING OF ECONOMIC WISDOM, HUMANITARIAN

CONCERN AND DEMOGRAPHIC STIMULUS THAT SERVES AUSTRAIA'S

PUBLIC INTEREST.

I WISH YOU WELL IN YOUR DELIBERATIONS. IN DOING SO KNOW

THAT THERE WILL, AS IN THE PAST, BE CONTINUING DEBATE ON

SUCH ISSUES AS TO WHETHER IMMIGRATION INCREASES REAL LIVING

STANDARDS AND DILUTES OR RAISES THE COUNTRY'S CAPITAL STOCK.

I LOOK FORWARD WITH INTEREST TO READING THE TRANSCRIPT OF

YOUR IMPORTANT PROCEEDINGS.
