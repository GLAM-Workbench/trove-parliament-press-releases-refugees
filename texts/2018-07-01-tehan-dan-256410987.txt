Tougher No Jab, No Pay rules start 1 July

Parents who don’t vaccinate their children against disease will lose part of their fortnightly family  support payment starting 1 July.

Family Tax Benefit Part A payments will be reduced by about $28 a fortnight for each child who  does not meet immunisation requirements, under tougher No Jab, No Pay rules.

The change to No Jab, No Pay provides a constant reminder for parents to keep their children’s  immunisation up to date.

Immunisation is the safest way to protect children from vaccine-preventable diseases.

Parents who don’t immunise their children are putting their own kids at risk as well as the children of  other people.

Since the Turnbull Government introduced No Jab, No Pay in 2016 about 243,000 children and their  families have taken action to ensure they meet the immunisation requirements.

The Turnbull Government provided more than $14 million in last year’s Budget for free, catch-up  vaccinations for children, young adults and newly arrived refugees.

It also provided $5.5 million over three years to encourage Australian parents and carers to  vaccinate their children.

Exemptions apply for children who have medical contraindications or natural immunity and have  been assessed by a general practitioner.
