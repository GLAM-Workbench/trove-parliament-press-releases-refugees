MORRISON THE AD MAN IN FULL FLIGHT: OLD FIGURES USED TO HIDE  INCREASE IN PEOPLE SMUGGLING

Today the Morrison Government gave an “exclusive” story to a newspaper  claiming the number of people arriving by airplane and claiming asylum has  fallen.

It hasn’t. In fact, the latest numbers show the number of airplane people is  actually rising.

Scott Morrison does not have a plan for stopping the people smugglers who  have shifted their business model from boats to planes under the Liberal and  National Government’s watch - he just has marketing spin.

Here are the facts.

Using the asylum protection system, people smugglers have helped traffic  some 100,000 people to Australia, leaving many of them vulnerable to  exploitation, wage theft, modern slavery and even sexual servitude.

In The Australian today, the Morrison Government proudly claims it has seen  “significant increases” in people being stopped from travelling to Australia and  claiming asylum inappropriately.

When you read the story, it might seem like the Government has chalked up a  win and that the people smugglers might be on the back foot.

In a pure ad man move that only Scott Morrison could be responsible for, the  Government has used old figures from 2018-19 to make its case, when they  know the 2019-20 numbers show the exact opposite.

This is nothing more than Scott Morrison using a “look over here” trick.





Based on figures released to the Senate in January, a total of 25,700  people are set to arrive by plane to claim asylum in the 2019-20 financial year  - up from 24,520 in 2018-19.

Disturbingly, because the Morrison Government is taking longer and longer to  resolve asylum seeker claims for airplane arrivals following budget cuts, the  people smugglers can successfully sell their message that a trip to Australia  can result in years and years of work rights.

Perhaps it is not surprising that a Government that spent all of last year saying  there is no crisis at our airport borders, but is now saying it has solved the  problem, has been exposed for being too cute by half.

Today’s story is a marketing trick from the ad man Prime Minister.

Mr Morrison needs to put away his marketing textbook and start to focus on  what his Government can do to stop this border crisis and stop the exploitation  of these people on Australian shores.
