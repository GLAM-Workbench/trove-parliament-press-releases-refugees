PRIME MINISTER



BILATERAL MEETING WITH PRIME MINISTER O’NEILL

Today I met with Papua New Guinea’s Prime Minister Peter O’Neill ahead of the Pacific Islands Forum.

This is my third visit to PNG as Prime Minister.

Australians value the bond we share with PNG, forged through history, geography and our enduring links.

We have shared many significant moments, including September 16, 1975 - the day PNG became  independent.

To mark this milestone, I am pleased to announce that Australia will provide $25 million over four years to  support the upgrade of PNG’s foremost national cultural institution, the PNG National Museum and Art  Gallery.

This will ensure that the remarkable building continues to showcase and preserve PNG’s rich cultural  heritage.

The Kokoda track is a powerful part of PNG's history. Since 2008, Australia has provided $40 million to  maintain and improve the Kokoda track. Today I announce a further $5 million per year over five years to  continue this initiative.

This will support the maintenance of the track, improve the quality of life for communities living and  working along it, and help protect its natural and cultural resources.

Prime Minister O’Neill and I discussed progress on processing and settlement under the Regional  Resettlement Arrangements. I thank PNG for its continued cooperation in this regional solution. Progress  has been made and we discussed the importance of moving ahead to settle those found to be refugees.

I congratulate Prime Minister O’Neill for hosting the Forum, which is focused on real reforms that can  improve the lives of all people in the Pacific region.
