ASIA-PACIFIC FACES IBSTABILITY DESPITE BND OF CQLD WARI HILL

The Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Robert Hill,  says the Asia-Pacific region is facing instability and  uncertainty, despite the end of the Cold War and a supposed  new era of global co-operation.

He made his comments in a paper entitled "The New World

Partnership? - A Strategy for the Asia-Pacific Region". The  paper was submitted to the weekend meetfng in Cyprus of the  Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs of the International  Democrat Union (IOU).

Senator Hill said the much-h~ralded "new world order" was

based on assumptions of co-operations partnership in solving  the world's crises, unity in motivation, and a willingness to  take collective action aqainst intransiqent states.

"Much of this, however, will remain an ideal for the medium to  lonq term," Senator Hill said.

Ã¢Â‘"In Ã¢Â‘ many ways, global Ã¢Â‘cohesion - achieved under the threat of  superpower conflict - has broken down, and from a kaleidoscope  of world stresses has emerged an enhanced regional focus. This  is so in economic, political and security terms. '\

"Disputes withi~ regions and competition between them are  becoming the characteristics of the 1990s world.

"The Asia-Pacific is in  pressures were never  allegiances, so it is  dangerous trends exist."

Senator Hill said the absence of superpower confrontation had  fundamentally altered global politibal and security  circumstances, and this was equally so in the Asia-Pacific.

He said the break-up of the Soviet Union and the resulting  republics' severe economic problems meant a reduced impact on  global politics and the Asia-Pacific.

The United States was now exploring and re-evaluating its role  in the region, and it was likely that the US would expect more  from its allies and friends by requiring them to take more  responsibility for regional stability.

Senator Hill said the regional perception that the US was at  least in part withdrawing from the Asia-Pacific had led to an  increased number of regional actors attempting to protect  their interests, and in turn a perceived increase in sources  of threat.

Sources of tension in the region - democracy movements, ethnic  disputes and regional rivalries - had not been constrained or  disguised by superpower allegiances.

"The US presence, has acted as a stabilising factor, rather  than an inhibitor, " Senator Hill said.

"With a perception of the reducing influence of the US, these  sources of tension could become more prominent."

Defence spending in the region was being maintained at  consistently high levels and forces were being modernised.  North Korea remained the most serious potential flashpoint in  the region, and would continue ,to be a source of great concern  and instability.

In security terms, the Pacific Island states were fragile and  open; and their main security problems would be the result of  internal forces of instability.  Senator Hill said that demands for democracy were likely to  become one of the most significant factors affecting regional  stability, especially when coupled with harsh military  suppression of these demands.

Economic tensions in the economically dynamic Asia-Pacific  were largely related to concern about deterioration in trade  relations between the US and Japan.  Senator Hill's paper includes 19 policy recommendations to the  members of the IDU, includinqs

STRENGTHEN existing regional economic arrangements to  encourage liberalisation and enhance regional co-operation;

ENCOURAGE the better management of economic relations  between the US and Japan;

REAFFIRM support for the military presence of the US in the  region, but appreciate that friends and allies will be  expected to boost contributions to regional security;

ENCOURAGE regional political reform and democratisation; and

ENCOURAGE restraint on defence spending in the Asia-Pacific.
