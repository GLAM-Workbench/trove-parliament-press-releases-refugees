PRESENTER:

The Opposition Leader Tony Abbott has gone north today to Darwin where he’ll outline  another plank of the Coalition’s policy to tackle people smugglers and to put them out of  business. The Coalition plans to spend millions of dollars to put more Australian police  officers into the region to work on deterrence. The policy also includes bounties to buy  boats from owners who might be tempted to sell them to smugglers and to give Indonesia  more money to improve its own search and rescue capabilities. The Opposition’s  Immigration Spokesman, Scott Morrison spoke to Chief Political Correspondent, Sabra  Lane.

SCOTT MORRISON:

The measures we’ll announce today deal with the practical commitment to regional  cooperation and a single minded focus on deterrence. Now that will include everything

from significantly upgrading our involvement in joint operations with the Indonesian  National Police to work with them and make that offer. It also involves community  outreach programmes which would involve bounties potentially through working through  villages, buying boats back where you can but also just promoting the awareness like we  did after the Bali bombings with counter-terrorism to raise awareness that people  smuggling is a criminal activity and it’s things that shouldn’t be encouraged or supported.

SABRA LANE:

On the buying of the boats, would you need to talk to Indonesia about that first? Who  would make the approach? Would it be Indonesian officials or Australian officials on the  ground?

MORRISON:

All of these programmes will be run through cooperation with officials in Indonesia and  what’s in the policy today is about an offer of practical support of a nature that will put  meaning to regional cooperation initiatives. Regional cooperation isn’t about talk, it’s  about actually doing things and we need to significantly upscale the work that has been  done throughout the region, not just in Indonesia but also in Malaysia and Sri Lanka and  that’s what this policy seeks to address.

LANE:

The programme, I believe, also talks about deploying more Federal Police Officers into  the region. How many and where would they go?

MORRISON:

Well the Government has taken AFP Officers out of Indonesia most recently. The  majority of the work done on the ground is done by Indonesian national police. But that  is done through a partnership with the Australian Federal Police and we would seek to  increase the capacity there, but also in Malaysia and in Sri Lanka where there is virtually  no presence from the Australian Federal Police apart from one officer and these are  resources that would be dedicated to working on people smuggling.

LANE:

The total cost all up - how much will it cost and what kind of impact do you think it will  have?

MORRISON:

The Government has had a focus on accommodating people coming through the region  and processing, and that’s been their view through their regional protection framework.

We will have a Regional Deterrence Framework which we believe always should have  been the focus but the costs of these will be outlined at our policy announcement today.

LANE:

Mr Morrison, the Indonesians occasionally seem to have trouble when it comes to search  and rescue operations in their own waters when there are boats in distress.  Have you got  plans in relation to that to help Indonesia?

MORRISON:

A significant component of this package is about providing the offer of support to put  additional capacity into Indonesia’s search and rescue capabilities, particularly along the  southern Javan coast where we’ve seen so many tragedies. This is about building the  capability to respond in Indonesia’s search and rescue zone. But not just the vessel, but  the maintenance and support for running those services, but also increasing our own  aerial surveillance to earlier detect vessels where we can and use that information to  ensure that rescues are put in place more readily wherever possible.

LANE:

The UN Human Rights Committee late yesterday called on Australia to release 46  detainees who've been in custody. They've been found to be refugees but haven't been  released because of security findings. This committee says the continued detainment is  inhumane, that these people deserve to be released and compensated. If you’re  Immigration Minister, what would you do?

MORRISON:

Well, there's a contradiction here. Under the Refugee Convention, someone can be found  not to be a refugee if there are national security risks involved. And while each of the  specific cases are not in front of me, I'm aware of the broader issue which is that where  there are national security issues at stake and ASIO has not provided that clearance and  there’s a process for that to be undertaken, then people can't just be released into the  community.

LANE:

And the Committee though said that they found that this is unfair and that these people  should be released.

MORRISON:

Well they're entitled to their view and Australia is entitled to protect its national security.
