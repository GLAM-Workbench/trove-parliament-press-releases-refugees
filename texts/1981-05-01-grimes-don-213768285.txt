AIDS FOR DISABLED - STALEMATE

The Program of Aids for the Disabled (the P.A.D. Scheme)  is unlikely to get off the ground before the end of the  financial year which will mean that the initial allocation  of $700,000 will revert to consolidated revenue.

It was clear from answers given by the Minister for Health  in a Nationwide interview on 22nd May that the program  had been announced and was still being developed without ,   the benefit of basic information such as the approximate  ! size of the target group.

Ms. Quihn-Boas:".... do you anticipate spending $700,000  dn five weeks?

Mr. MacKellar;  "Well hopefully we won't waste the money  and the States will, if they accept the invitation that  -I've sent to them then they'll be responsible for getting  ; the expenditure in a proper way to the extent that they

can, but it is an ongoing program. It will be an onÂ­ going program so that everything won't stop on June 30th.

M s . Booth:  "Just how was the sum of $700,000 arrived at? V '

Mr. MacKellar: "Well we had information or the Department has information about the possible need within the  community. We looked at the amount of time that it was  going to be in place before the end of the financial year  and it was on the basis of information supplied by the  Department to me and to the Government that the amount  was decided.

M s . Booth: " .... has your Department arrived at a number of disabled people?" t

Mr. MacKellar:  "We have obviously consultation between the various Departments, whether it be the Department of  Social Security, whether it be the Department of Veterans'  Affairs, or whether it be my Department. All three working

together. Now obviously, as you say, there are no precise  figures and that's one of the problems that you come up  against in arriving at a figure like this. Also you have  to make a decision as to whether people are eligible for  benefits under any other scheme which may be operating  either at the Commonwealth level or at the State level

and this scheme is for those people who aren't covered by  either another Commonwealth scheme or a State scheme."

The Minister was obviously unable or unwilling to supply  straight answers to these basic questions. In the light  of this he would probably find it even harder to explain:

. What proportion of the original $700,000 has now been offered to the States for administrative  costs; and

. On what basis the program can be called "on-going"  when future allocations depend on the forthcoming  Budget?

-2-

The P.A.D.Scheme is a particularly sad example of the  Fraser Government rushing into a project that appears to  be compassionate and caring, while close examination  reveals a lack of planning, a lack of essential data,

and a lack of consultation with the parties who  administer and benefit from the scheme.

In the event, the first stage of a program described  by the Minister as of "great significance to a great  number of disabled people", is unlikely to see the  light of day.

.FAMILY ALLOWANCES WORTH $500 MILLION A YEAR LESS

^On 21 May 1981 Senator Chaney answered questions on notice about the run-down in family allowances.

^He stated:-1. The cost in 1980-81 of increasing the rate of family  allowances from 1 July 1980 by the increase in the  CPI between June 1976 and June 1980 is estimated to

be $470 million a year. (By May 1981 the CPI  increase would take that well over the $500 million  mark).

2. If the rate of family allowances had been increased by  the CPI movement from June 1976 and March 1981 the  cumulative monthly family allowances would increase by the following amounts:

(a) one child $8.65

(b) two children $21.00 (c) three children $35.80 (d) four children $50.60 (e) five children $67.90

The Government, in the Razor Gang Report, totalled 350  decisions to save $560 million.

By making just one decision - not to index family allowances  Mr. Fraser saved the same amount in one year.

Yet, he is the same Prime Minister who claims that money  does not belong to the Commonwealth, or the States, but to  the taxpayer.

NATIONAL ACOUSTICS LABORATORIES AND HEARING AIDS

The Razor Gang decision on 30 April 1981 read as  follows: .

"The major portion of the National Acoustics  *  Laboratories work to be carried out by the private sector with Australian firms tendering  :  for the manufacture and assembly of hearing i  aids. N.A.L. will continue to fit and repair  , aids for eligible persons."

This change seems to relate solely to the manufacture and  ^assembly of hearing aids. At present N.A.L. is the only  Australian organisation designing hearing aids, tendering  ifor their manufacture and finally supplying the completed

product to priority groups such as school children,  service personnel and pensioners.

Private firms obtain their hearing aids from foreign-  owned suppliers. .

There is no good argument for disrupting the current  system of N.A.L. manufacture, testing and supply. There  is only the Government's obsession in replacing public  enterprise with commercial operation.

The only obstacle to N.A.L. fulfilling its role has been  the rigid staff ceilings imposed by the Fraser Government.  This has caused lengthening delays in testing pensioners  with hearing problems and providing their hearing aids.

The delays are up to nine months in some areas, particularly  New South Wales and Victoria. Audiology teams are visiting  country areas less frequently, the number of visits last  year being only half that in 1979.

With such constant delays pensioners are, unfortunately,  vulnerable to the heavy advertising of private suppliers  who charge around $300, but can guarantee immediate supply.

The N.A.L. priority groups do not include students between  the ages of 21 and 25, nor the unemployed between the ages  of 21 and 64. An ABS survey on hearing and hearing aids in  1978 found there were 768,000 persons over 15 with hearing  problems. This represents about 1 person in every 14.

We have almost half a million persons between 15 and 64 with  hearing problems and a 6% unemployment rate. Though some  will be on invalid pensions, this probably means that about 25,000 unemployed people, who are not eligible for pensioner  concessions, must out of a social security benefit below

the poverty line, find several hundred dollars to buy a  commercial hearing aid or go without.

There is a strong case, particularly in the Year of  Disabled Persons, for upgrading the N.A.L.s manufacturing  capacity, increasing its staff and training more  audiologists. The N.A.L. has a world reputation and an  enviable record of efficiency.

An expansion of its capacity would relieve the anxiety of  .pensioners, and could then include the unemployed and  full-time students over 21 as priority clients.

People should not be prevented from leading a full  personal life because they cannot afford the price of a  ,commercial hearing aid.

(INCOME SPLITTING

JA proposal currently under discussion is the possibility  of allowing families to aggregate spouse incomes. These  >would then be divided equally between spouses, allowing  each to pay tax on half the aggregate. This advantages

the single high income family. A man earning

$500 per week would now be liable to pay:

$162.05 tax as a single person  $145.85 tax claiming a full spouse rebate  $114.40 if he could split the income and  tax with his non-income earning

wife.

Thus he would be $47.65 per week better off than a single  person on the same income, or someone who cannot claim a  spouse rebate. He would also be $32.17 per week better  off splitting tax than at present claiming the full tax  rebate.

If he was earning $200 per week, he would not do so well.  He would be $24.05 better off than the person taxed on  single rate but only $8.64 better off than at present with  the spouse rebate.

As tax splitting depends on the presence of a non-working  or low-earning spouse, it bears little or no relationship  to the presence or absence of children. In fact, it is  likely that tax splitting will put more resources into  high income non-child families.

On 1979figures, 45% of women with children worked for pay  as opposed to 38% of those without.

.. 5 ..

- 5-

815.000 wives with children are in the paid workforce, and  will probably not be able to benefit from tax splitting. 1.020.000 wives with children are not and could benefit from tax splitting (or their husbands will). However,

897,500 families without children would also use tax splitting for their benefit.

<  .  _

Additional problems are also presented by the number of  single parents who could not benefit - as they have no  partner to share their income.

INVALID PENSIONS - A  TERRIBLE MISCALCULATION

It is clear that the Government had no notion of the  consequences that would follow from its action in 1979  to redefine eligibility for the invalid pension and  apply those criteria quite savagely.

Mr. Lanigan1s memo 'Control of Invalid Pensions'  instructed senior officers in Social Security to tighten  up on invalid pensions because he was expecting in  1978/79 a 9.4% increase - "rather higher than might be  expected from normal growth".

The effect of the changes was not to stabilise invalid  pensions at "normal growth". The new rules created chaos,  delayed decisions,and pensions vetoed by non-examining  doctors.

There was in every month after the application of the  new rules quite an 'abnormal'  decrease in the numbers. While all other pension categories grew, invalid pension  numbers declined for the first time since figures had  been kept.

In the years between 30 June 1972 and 30 June 1980 the  number of invalid pensioners grew by just over 8% a year.

In the 7*5 months between 30 June 1980 and 13 February 1981  the number dropped by 2%. In that time 12,637 people who  would have been granted pensions under the old rules  were refused. Only 2,000 have appealed. Up till 7th  May when the new guidelines were announced by Senator

Chaney, probably 12,000 accepted the refusal of their pension  application and are living on lesser benefits.

In all conscience the Government cannot switch the rules  to cut numbers and then switch, back because of adverse  publicity, leaving stranded people whom it now admits were  penalised by too harsh guidelines.

. .6..

It is a scandal if the Government does not give every one of those people a second chance of proving the required 85% incapacity.

To make matters worse, three weeks later the new guidelines  have not yet been received by social offices, Social  Security Appeals Tribunals or Commonwealth Medical  Officers. '

It is known that some cases are still being decided under  the old rules. Officials have been known to say  "What new Rules? I haven't seen them".

People wanting copies are advised to request them directly  'from the office of Senator Chaney in Parliament House,  /Canberra.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ON HEALTH CHANGES *  *

(correct at time of printing)

Q . : What are the major changes likely to affect people? A . : Commonwealth medical benefits only for those with private  insurance - fund benefits will rise from 75% to 85%  for all.

Doctors can only bulk-bill for those who earn below  set incomes determined by the Government, not doctors.

Free hospital care restricted to those passing the  income test.

Q . :  Who receives the free medical and hospital care? A.: Pensioners with PHB cards, migrants and refugees in  their first 6 months in Australia, unemployed persons  who have same income as other 1  disadvantaged1  as defined

by Income Test, low income workers defined as *  disadvantaged1  under the Income Test.

Q . :  What is the Income Test for the disadvantaged? A.: Families, including single parent families with a gross weekly income (including pensions of $160 plus  $20 extra for each child) can be bulk-billed by

doctors for medical treatment and receive free  treatment in a public hospital. Single rate is  $96 a week.

Q.: Who decides who is disadvantaged? A . : The Department of Social Security decides based on the  applications from those who believe they may qualify.  Eligibility will have to be reviewed every 6 months

after reapplication, not automatically.

.. 7 ..

- ÃÂ Â­

ÃÂ. : What about students? A . :  Full time students up to 25 years can be covered by  parents' basic private medical and hospital insurance.  Funds are free to impose restrictions in other tables.

Students will be free to apply for disadvantaged status  on their own behalf but they will have to satisfy the  Department of Social Security that they are not dependent ,  on their family and that their income is below the

permissible level.

Q . :  How do the changes affect pensioners? A.: Pensioners with PHB cards still receive free medical  care through bulk billing and claiming 85% benefit,  and free hospital care.

Pensioners without PHB cards will have to take private  medical and hospital insurance, or personally meet  medical and hospital bills. .

'i

Q . : What will be the new basic fund benefits? A.: Medical 85% of the schedule medical fee for any one  service with a maximum patient contribution of $10 for  any one service.

Hospital Cover against the cost of a shared room in  a public hospital (probably $80 a day) and any  outpatient fee. This covers choice of doctor in  hospital.

Q . : Will funds offer other tables? A . :  Yes - for private accommodation in hospitals and cost  of private hospital care, and for 100% medical and for  extra benefits. These will differ from fund to fund.

Q. :  What are the differences in Table Cover? A.: The answer given to question 'What will be the new basic  fund benefits' (two questions ago) shows what is in a  basic table. Higher tables offered by funds

incorporate basic benefits and add an additional  cover against the cost of more expensive hospital  costs, or the 15% extra for 100% medical cover. While  the fund can impose restrictions on this, additional  benefit or cover, they must pay out the basic benefit  without those restrictions.

Q . :  Will there be any waiting periods for health insurance? A . : It is expected that all funds will have to allow immediate  cover for 2 months from the 1st September for basic  private medical and hopsital cover. After that, there

will be a two month wait for medical and hospital benefits.

- 8-

Funds will probably continue to have longer waiting ,   periods for additional benefits but can only have a  two month wait on basic tables

Q . :  What about pre-existing ailments - chronic illnesses? A.: Funds will not be allowed to refuse or restrict  membership on benefits because of a pre-existing  or chronic ailment on the basic table. They are '  free to apply restrictions, or refuse membership

on higher tables or additional benefits. :

Q . : What about pregnancy? A.: The waiting period for basic fund benefits can only  be two months even for pregnancies. Longer waiting  periods can be applied on higher tables.

7Q . : What if I don't take out private insurance and I earn  more than the income level? A . : You will receive no benefits against the cost of medical  care. (But any expenses will be tax deductible - if

your deductions are over the $1,590 automatic rebate  level). .

You will have to pay your hospital accommodation and  treatment charges yourself.

Q . :  What about the chronically ill? A . :  There is no special provision made for them; they would  have to satisfy the income test for free medical and  hospital care or take private insurance.

Q. :  Is there any provision made for single parent families  and recipients of part-pension? A . : No, they have to pass the income levels as outlined in  the answer to third question (previous page).

Q . ; Are general insurance companies not registered under the National Health Act authorised to offer basic medical  insurance cover? A . : No. If people hold cover with these funds they will not

receive the Commonwealth medical benefit paid through  registered funds.

Q . :  What is the position of veterans? A.: Remains unchanged.

Q . : What happens to cosmetic surgery after 1 September? A.: The Government has already deleted items relating to  hair transplants, facelifts, eyelid and certain breat  augmentation from the medical benefits list. No fund

will pay a medical benefit on these unless the  operation is medically necessary. The Government has  indicated that it could also be removing other items  from the schedule.

"WORK - OR THE WANT OF IT" (116 pages) $6.50 from ACOSS, 149 Castlereagh St.,   Sydney N.S.W. 2000

ACOSS has produced an up-to-date book on employment and  unemployment.

It charts the myths and realities of the workplace and  the job market. Work participation rates and the  composition of the labour force are discussed, with other  sections on the causes and casualties of unemployment.

The facts are presented with skill and thoroughness. The tables are well set out. In providing the data to  counter negative propaganda against the unemployed, this  book treats the problems of the workers and workless with

sensitive consideration.

Strong arguments are also put up for manpower policies  and job creation programs.

This invaluable guide to the facts on employment and  unemployment should be read as widely as possible to  remind us all of the people our economy is leaving behind.
