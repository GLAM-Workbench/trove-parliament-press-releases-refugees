GLEN BARTHOLOMEW: Well, Federal Cabinet will meet tonight to decide on a way ahead on the troubled issue of

asylum-seekers.

The Immigration Minister said yesterday legal advice to him was that last week's High Court decision had ruled out any

offshore detention under existing law.

Well, Tony Abbott says he doesn't think the court's ruling has that effect, and he's offered to cooperate with the

Government on changing the Immigration Act if that's needed to remove any doubts.

One of the Cabinet Ministers who'll be considering that thorny issue today is the Trade Minister, Craig Emerson, who's

spoken to Marius Benson.

MARIUS BENSON: Craig Emerson, how do you feel about the prospect of working with Tony Abbott on a key piece of

legislation?

CRAIG EMERSON: Oh well, working with people constructively is a hell of a lot better than three-word slogans. And Mr

Abbott seems to be persisting with his three-word slogans: "stop the boats," "phone the President".

The High Court ruling did invalidate the regional processing centre in Malaysia, but it also cast very serious doubt on

Mr Abbott's policy of picking up the phone to the President of Nauru. And it needs to be appreciated that Mr Abbott's

policy is no more sustainable than the Malaysian solution. And we need to work on that basis.

BENSON: Well, that's the reason he is now offering to change the Immigration Act in cooperation with you. Do you

think this is an honest offer or do you think it is, as some in Labor believe, a disingenuous offer aimed at wedging Labor

and dividing the Left off from the main body of opinion in Labor?

EMERSON: Well, I'm actually going to resist the temptation to make a pre-judgement here, but it is a very strong

temptation based on Mr Abbott's record in the past of slogans and simplistic solutions.

We respect now the decision of the High Court. We need to work within the parameters that have been established by

the High Court, and that means that we need to consider all options.

BENSON: Okay. Well, you'll be part of the Cabinet meeting which decides on the options. In your mind, which way

should the Government go: join Tony Abbott and resolve any doubts about offshore detention or abandon offshore

processing?

EMERSON: No. Well, I'm a team player and I want to hear the views of my colleagues and express my views in any

Cabinet discussion on this. So I don't want to pre-empt in any way the consideration of options that could be on the

table.

BENSON: Some leading figures on the Left of Labor have already publicly made up their mind about this. They say

they are not going down the Opposition route; they won't go down any policy that involves the Nauru option or

temporary protection visas. Do you believe the Left will go along with whatever the Government does decide?

EMERSON: Well, it's a matter for individual members. I don't know that you can describe the decisions or views of

individuals as the views of the Left or the Right, or the Centre or the Extreme Centre, or the left right out or anyone

else. You know there's a diversity of views within the Labor Party; that is true. There's a diversity of views within the

community; that is equally true. And it's quite probable that the diversity of views within the Labor Party reflects the

diversity of views in the community.

BENSON: There's a Newspoll out today just on the specific question of how well the Government is handling the issue

of asylum seekers. Seventy-eight per cent of people say badly. Are they right?

EMERSON: Well, I think once a High Court brings down a decision that rules out — invalidates — a regional solution

to a regional problem, people are going to say, 'well, that hasn't worked'. It's true: it hasn't worked. So I'm not surprised

about the poll.

BENSON: Can I just turn to workplace law for a moment? Because the Australian Industry Group, one of the key

employer groups, is holding a public conference today, and it is critical of Labor's Fair Work Act for being one of the

reasons that productivity growth is so low. They want a return to flexibility, these employers, and they want a return to

individual contracts. Will Labor listen to those calls?

EMERSON: Labor won't be going back to AWAs. AWAs were actually used to strip away penalty rates, pay and

conditions for working Australians.

Now, when we talk about productivity, productivity is GDP per hour worked. So what's the proposition: that Australians

aren't working enough hours, or that they're featherbedding; there's too much staff in shops and in factories?

And, again, if I could mention Mr Abbott in this context, he says he's the workers' friend. But on the steel industry he

says, 'what we've got to do is deal with is featherbedding'. That's just another word for him arguing that there are too

many steel workers and more steel workers should lose their jobs.

So, let's have a proper debate. But again, let's not go into slogans. And we will not being going back to the individual

contracts — AWAs, individual contracts — that Mr Abbott wants to return to. And we know that the Coalition, in

addition, wants to strip away penalty rates and they want to bring back unfair dismissal laws. So, there is a very clear

contrast between the policies of the Coalition and the policies of the Labor Government.

BENSON: Craig Emerson, thanks very much.

EMERSON: Thank you, Marius.

BARTHOLOMEW: The Trade Minister, Craig Emerson, speaking to Marius Benson ahead of the Cabinet meeting held

tonight, looking at some of the issues that it will consider.
