TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW - SKY NEWS AM AGENDA WITH KIERAN GILBERT -  PENNY WONG AND PETER DUTTON

SUBJECT:  DEATH OF AUSTRALIAN SOLDIER; CLIMATE CHANGE; IMMIGRATION;  PLAIN PACKAGING OF TOBACCO.

E  & O E - PROOF ONLY



GILBERT: Let me introduce our guests this morning on AM Agenda, the Finance Minister  Penny Wong and the shadow health minister Peter Dutton. Good morning to you both.

WONG: Good morning.

DUTTON: Good morning.

GILBERT: A very sad way to start the program this morning - another Australian soldier  killed as we’ve been advised. Defence yet to confirm that, Minister. But as I say, the news  conference held shortly.

WONG: Well look our thoughts and prayers are always with those serving overseas. And  we have seen unfortunately many families who have had bad news over the years. I can’t  comment on this until Stephen and the Chief of the Defence Force obviously make their  announcement for privacy reasons. Obviously that’s the way we need to deal with this.

GILBERT: Indeed. Shadow minister Dutton, your reaction? Obviously, you know, when the  Minister stands up, it’s something serious. This is again sad news out of Afghanistan.

DUTTON:  Well it is, we can only go by these initial reports but as Penny rightly says, our  thoughts and prayers are with not just the immediate family but the extended family in the  ADF. They always feel this terribly, a loss of one of their own. And we have to make sure  that at this time, and there always is bipartisan support for whatever assistance can be  pledged to that family and to the unit that that soldier came from.

GILBERT: Absolutely. Well let’s look at some of the other issues of the day as we await  that news conference with Mr Smith and the CDF.

On climate change, the forum continues today, the Climate Change Commission holding a  forum here in Canberra. But Minister, yesterday, it did appear that the Commission seemed  to endorse at least in part, some of the Coalition’s direct action plan. It said that it can’t be  that on its own but it did say that it had some merits, didn’t it?

WONG: I think that’s a very optimistic reading of that part of the report. I did take the  opportunity in Estimates last night to read as much as possible of that report. It says a  number of things. It says, first, the science is clear: the climate is changing. It says that  we’re already noticing the effects of that. It talks about the number of record hot days in the  last half century having doubled. And it says this is the critical decade to act. And we all  know that to act effectively, you have to put a price on carbon. Malcolm Turnbull has  confirmed that again.

The direct action plan doesn’t work and costs a lot. And it involves billions of dollars being  taken from taxpayers without compensation, without assistance and being given to polluters  hoping that that might have an effect. What the Commission said is that some of these  sequestration issues might assist, but they’re not enough. That’s consistent with what  Malcolm Turnbull has said and consistent with what economists say. Really Tony Abbott’s  plan is not a plan.

GILBERT: Peter Dutton, on this forum that continues - the Commission holding a  roundtable with MPs today to provide briefings - the Opposition Leader says that there’s  bipartisan support on the science. And yet it doesn’t appear that all of your party, the  Coalition, is convinced. We saw Barnaby Joyce yesterday mocking the Commission and  Nick Minchin calls it ‘climate alarmism’. Are you alarmed that some of your colleagues don’t  believe in the science?

DUTTON: Well Kieran, I want to address some of what Penny had to say. I think it was  probably the most selective analysis of the report that came out yesterday. It was significant  for the Coalition in that it did endorse that direct action plan that we took to the last election.  It does say that that needs to be a significant part of what’s the solution going forward.

Now, I think also what people can read from the report is that Australia acting alone without  anything from the United States, without anything from China or from India, I think that’s  why there’s scepticism, particularly in the community at the moment. Because people are  saying, well why would you export jobs? Why would the Labor Greens coalition entertain  this idea of stopping coal mines or closing it down? A $50 billion a year industry, 100,000  jobs.

WONG: This is just scaremongering and it’s just not correct.

DUTTON: This is what your partners want to do, Penny.

WONG: Well that’s the Greens policy. The Government’s policy has never been to end the  coal industry.

DUTTON: You’re in partnership with the Greens.

WONG: You ought not say that. I mean, this really demonstrates the way in which the  Coalition cannot deal with this issue other than by scaremongering.

DUTTON: I’m just reporting those statements.

WONG: The reality is that is just scare mongering. And I think, you know, are you going to  answer the question that was put to you? You have colleagues who say this is alarmist.  You have colleagues who simply deny the science. I mean, Senator Minchin who installed  your leader asserts that climate change is some sort of left wing conspiracy to de-industrialise the Western world. These are the sorts of views that your Party is full of.

DUTTON: Penny, if you talk to people like Martin Ferguson or Simon Crean and others in  their most private moments, as I understand it, there are some sceptics within your own  ranks. They’re obviously able to quieten down because they have a lot of pressure on them.  But the fact is -

WONG: Is that the best you can do Peter?

DUTTON:  That’s the reality.

WONG: Is that the best you can do?

DUTTON: The problem the Government’s got at the moment, Penny, and why there is such  a big disconnect between the public and the Government is that you are not listening to the  Australian public. You are telling people that they are idiots. You are telling people that they  don’t have -

WONG: I’m not saying they’re idiots. No one’s saying that. Why are you saying that?

DUTTON: You’re telling people in our democracy that they don’t have the ability to believe  what they want to believe.

WONG: Who is saying that? Who is saying that?

DUTTON: You are.

WONG: You just assert these things, Peter.

DUTTON: You are completely dismissive of people within the community.

WONG: You just assert these things without any basis -

DUTTON: I think that’s part of the Government’s problem.  I just want to make this point,  Kieran. The fact is that our plan accepts climate change.

WONG: It doesn’t work.

DUTTON: Our plan meets the same target that yours does -

WONG: It doesn’t.

DUTTON: - in terms of reducing emissions by 2020.

GILBERT:  OK there’s obviously disagreement there. You say it works but Senator Wong  says it won’t.

WONG: $30 billion is what it would cost. That’s what taxpayers would have to pay.

GILBERT: Let me ask you though about something which the Commission has found and  suggested yesterday that, for example, the Great Barrier Reef - it cannot be saved without  international action; that there needs to be concerted international action. That’s something  you need to convince people of, isn’t it? That we’re not going out there on our own?

WONG: Climate change is a global problem. Everyone has always acknowledged that. The  Government has always acknowledged that. And Peter just yet again, pointed to other  countries, but not only not acknowledging that they are acting, but more importantly saying  that’s a justification for us not to act. I mean that’s not the Australian way. We don’t sit back  and say, we’re just going to let everybody else deal with this problem that will affect us and  we’re not going to get our hands dirty. We’re not going to try and help as well.

I mean, this is a global problem. It’s not going to be stopped by one country alone. But it’s  not going to be stopped if every country says, it’s not our problem. And that’s their position.

GILBERT: OK before we move on, just quickly, Peter Dutton, on that, your conservative  colleagues in the United Kingdom last week announced a very ambitious reduction. There  are efforts in New Zealand. There are efforts across Europe, in China. There are also steps  forward. Australia won’t be leading the way on this.

DUTTON: Well let’s look at a couple of facts, Kieran. In the United Kingdom they’re talking  about a plan in 2025 - first point. The second point is that they’re largely reliant on nuclear  energy. We’re not. If you look at the Canadians who have just gone to an election and an  overwhelming majority of the conservative government there has been returned. Their  policy was not to go ahead with a similar great big new tax that Labor’s proposing here.

In New Zealand, their ETS is being wound back. President Obama is as far away from a  plan on this stuff as he has ever been. There is no plan for China. There is no plan for India.  And Penny is right in saying that we should be a responsible corporate citizen. But with a  population of 22 million people with a fraction of a percentage of world emissions we  shouldn’t be out there ahead of the world either.

WONG: And we’re not.

GILBERT: OK let’s move on to a couple of issues - asylum seekers. The United Nations  High Commissioner for Human Rights has said last night if Australia is serious about  sending 800 people out to Malaysia then I think it violates refugee law. It cannot send  individuals to a country that has not ratified the torture convention, convention on refugees.

WONG: Well look, I saw those comments. I’ve seen other comments by people in the  UNHCR as well recognising that we do need a regional approach to this. We do need to  resolve this issue and that Australia - by doing this - is resolving one of the problems which  is the large, you know, we’ve got a bank up in Malaysia. We have to break the people  smuggling model. This is what our approach does.

GILBERT: Peter Dutton, there have been mixed reports out of the UNHCR, some  suggesting that it is a step forward. The Commissioner, the Human Rights Commissioner,  suggesting that it obviously isn’t from the quote that I just read.

DUTTON: Look, I think it’s clear, Kieran, that the Government is in a complete muddle at  the moment when it comes to their immigration policy and I think Australians recognise that.  I see reports today that it may be that we don’t have to send the 800 people to Malaysia to  get the 4000 into our country. It may be that we are obliged to accept 4000 without 800  going the other way. That would be a remarkable deal.

WONG: It would mean the people smuggling model has been broken.

DUTTON: That would probably be the most stupid deal that the Prime Minister has come  up with yet and that’s a fair statement because this is a government that has presided over  a mess not just in immigration but in health, in economics, in taxation.

WONG: Can I just make this point -

GILBERT: Yeah sure.

WONG: If the 800 haven’t come, it means the people smuggling model has been broken.  So I mean, that’s the -

DUTTON: Malaysia doesn’t have to take one for us to be obliged to accept the 4000 -

WONG: Let me finish. The lack of logic in your position is, ‘oh this is really bad because if  the 800 don’t come, we still have to take these additional 4000’.

DUTTON: I’m not saying that, I’m not saying that. All I’m saying is that -

WONG: If we don’t have 800 refugees, asylum seekers, landing in Australia for return to  Malaysia then clearly the model has worked because the people smuggling business case  has been broken.

GILBERT: That’s a fair point, isn’t it? You know, if there aren’t 800 to send, that means that  the numbers haven’t arrived here.

DUTTON: That’s not as I understand the report. As I understand the report, there’s no  obligation for Malaysia, even if 800 people plus come to our country on the boats, there is  still no obligation for Malaysia to accept those, but the onus on us will be to accept the  4000. And the five for one swap is just the latest iteration, I think, in a complete policy  disaster by a government who clearly has lost control of our borders.

GILBERT: Let’s move on to the issue of plain packaging for tobacco. It looks like there’s a  backbench revolt within the Coalition ranks. Alex Somlyay, Ken Wyatt and Mal Washer are  apparently going to advise the partyroom today that they will cross the floor. What’s your  view as the shadow health minister? Should there be plain packaging or not?

6



DUTTON: Well Kieran, we’re happy to have a look at the Government legislation. Now just  to put this into perspective, the Government doesn’t plan to introduce this legislation until  the winter sitting, so as far as sort of August it may be before this legislation comes before  the Parliament.

At the moment there’s an exposure draft. They have that open for comment until I think the  first week in June. It doesn’t have a start date until, an effective start date, until July of  2012. What we’ve asked from the Government to do is produce the evidence, to show us  that this is the best way forward.

GILBERT: The Nationals haven’t though. The Nationals say that they won’t back it. They’re  opposed to it from the get-go.

DUTTON: Well when we were in government, Kieran, and Tony Abbott was the Health  Minister, we introduced the health warnings, the graphic health warnings that you get on  cigarette packets now. When I was the shadow health minister only a couple of years ago  we proposed the increase in the excise.

GILBERT: What about this? This is another step and the Nationals have said, Barnaby  Joyce this morning said - he was making it very clear that they don’t back this plan. So one  way or the other, you’re going to have division within your party over this.

DUTTON: Kieran, we will negotiate with people within our own ranks and we’re talking,  obviously, to people in the community, retailers who are quite upset about what the  government’s proposing. Don’t forget, this is the government that presided over FuelWatch  and GroceryWatch. This has been trotted out on four occasions, generally at a time when  there is a bad poll for the Prime Minister, or there’s discussion about Kevin Rudd  embarrassing Julia Gillard again. This is not a government that’s able to produce the  evidence. We will back measures which will effectively reduce smoking rates, but there’s no  evidence on the table at the moment, and what -

WONG: Well, hang on -

GILBERT: Well, we’ll come to the Minister to respond to that.

WONG: Thank you. Perhaps the evidence might be how much the tobacco companies are  opposing it.

DUTTON: (inaudible) warnings -

WONG: I heard you out, I heard you out on this issue, Peter. It’s clear that you don’t have a  position. Barnaby Joyce said on radio this morning that they were opposing it. As a shadow  health minister, really it’s incumbent upon you to do the right thing in the party room.

What is clear here is that Tony Abbott is caught between doing the right thing, which  everybody knows is to go down the plain packaging path, to reduce the capacity of big  tobacco to market. But he’s caught between that, doing the right thing, and the many  donations you are still accepting from big tobacco.

DUTTON: Well, hang on. That’s nonsense, that’s nonsense.

7





WONG: That’s true. It’s not nonsense, you are.

DUTTON: No, no, just -

WONG: Let me finish, and people in your own party, who think that this is some sort of  property thing. That’s the way in which Barnaby described it this morning, this is intellectual  property rights. I mean you’re the shadow health minister, are you going to do the right  thing?

GILBERT:  But the Coalition’s still receiving donations - that’s a fact - from these  companies. But it’s not nonsense, is it.

DUTTON: Kieran, it’s nonsense that we’re affected by those donations. I mean, I find it  completely offensive to suggest -

WONG: Well maybe you should get rid of them.

DUTTON: I heard you out, now hear me out. To suggest that somehow our view is  persuaded by that. I mean, they are a legal company, they make donations to political  parties, as many other companies and individuals do, both to the Labor Party, and to the  Liberal Party.

WONG: Well, we don’t take (inaudible) -

DUTTON: Look at the record at the time that these companies were making donations. We  decreased the smoking rate, the biggest fall in our country’s history when Tony Abbott was  health minister. We introduced graphic health warnings, which the industry opposed. I  proposed, along with our leader at the time, an increase of $2 billion in the excise because  pricing, we know, works when it comes to cigarettes. Children and adults are not addicted  to branding on cigarettes, they are addicted to nicotine.

GILBERT: Why are you sceptical about the packaging, though? Why do you think that  that’s not going to make an impact?

DUTTON:  I just don’t have the evidence one way or the other, Kieran. I’ve asked the  Government to produce the evidence. We’ve said we’ve got an open mind. Now, Penny  says we should declare our position now. I haven’t seen the legislation. There’s a draft  exposure out.

WONG: It’s been out for some time.

DUTTON: There’s a draft exposure out but there is no -

WONG: Tell me you’ve read it.

DUTTON: I have read it, but there is no final Bill before the House. And the Government  obviously, if they’re in their negotiating -

WONG: What’s your view on the draft?

8





DUTTON: Well, if the Government is sincere in asking for opinions, which is why they’ve  got an exposure draft out, presumably the final draft will not be what’s in its current form.

WONG: Well, Peter, we look forward to receiving your response, if you’re interested in  making a response. At the moment we have a completely different position amongst  members of the Opposition.

DUTTON: We would just like to see the evidence.

WONG: And you are the shadow health minister.

DUTTON: We would like to see the evidence that the Government is relying on. I mean,  why not an increase in excise? Why not some other measure?

WONG: Is that Coalition policy?

DUTTON: Why not another measure in relation to packaging, or if they’re clearly for  prohibition, then announce that? I mean, this is the phoniness -

GILBERT: Can you win the Nationals, though, regardless. When you get the advice, can  you win the Nationals who clearly have said they don’t want to support this initiative.

DUTTON: Kieran, we will see the legislation in its final form. I will take that to the Coalition  partyroom. We will have a discussion in shadow cabinet. That is the normal process with  any bill. Just bear in mind that this is being trotted out for the fourth time because the  Government is on the rocks. Nothing to do with the health debate, it’s all to do with a red  herring to distract from asylum seekers, from carbon tax, from mining tax -

WONG: That’s just not true. This has been our policy for a long time. Nicola has been  working on it. That’s just a line to try and get you out of the shemozzle you’re in as shadow  health minister when you’ve got your leader prevaricating and Barnaby Joyce saying ‘no’.  And you know it’s the right thing.

DUTTON: Penny, what you don’t want to be talking about is carbon tax.

WONG: We spoke about climate change first up.

DUTTON: You don’t want to be talking about this huge tax on families and business. You  don’t want to be talking about it, this is the problem.

WONG: I’m happy to talk about climate change.

GILBERT: Peter, the Coalition has been successful in keeping the focus on the  Government, and obviously politically doing very well in the opinion polls. Are you worried  that some of the moves like this from these backbenchers floating their ideas in the paper,  and the comments from Malcolm Turnbull last week, that people are maybe showing a little  bit of hubris. One former Coalition staffer in The Australian today is saying that that’s the big  risk for the Coalition; that you might show some hubris being well in front in the polls.

9



DUTTON: Kieran, I think we’ve been successful over the last couple of years because we  have supported good policy and we’ve opposed bad policy. And we want to make a  decision about whether this is good policy or bad, and we will go forward on that basis. It is  no different to the decision we took in relation to the carbon tax. We believe that’s bad for  the economy, and it’s bad for business. This is a government that’s in coalition with the  Greens. They want to close the mining industry down, we think that’s bad policy.

WONG: That’s not true. You see you’re lying again. You should stop lying Peter. You really  should -

DUTTON: Well, Penny, that is the Deputy Leader of the Greens stated position.

WONG: And that is not the Government’s position.

DUTTON: And this is your partner in government.

WONG: That is not the Government’s position, and twice in this interview now you have  simply again repeated something which is untrue. Now if you can’t win the debate by  actually addressing the facts, clearly you’ve just decided we’ll just lie.

DUTTON: Penny, I think what we should be talking about is whether or not you support a  $60 or $100 a tonne carbon price -

WONG: We will put out the carbon price.

DUTTON: - or will it be an ineffective price which effectively will just put a huge tax with no  economic or environmental benefit.

WONG: We will put out the details, and we can have a discussion then.

DUTTON: I mean, that’s pretty much where you’re headed, isn’t it?

GILBERT: Well, listen, we’re going to take a quick break, thank you both very much for  being with us. I’m going to, because we’re waiting, our viewers can see on the screen there  the pictures of the Russell Defence Headquarters. We’re going to take you there very soon  live for this news conference with the Chief of the Defence Force. But in the meantime,  Penny Wong and Peter Dutton, appreciate your time this morning.

WONG: Good to be with you.

DUTTON: Thanks very much.
