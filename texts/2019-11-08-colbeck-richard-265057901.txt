Grants available to help bring communities together through sport

Almost $20 million is now available to help communities promote social inclusion and  improve health outcomes through sport.

The Morrison Government’s Driving Social Inclusion through Sport and Physical Activity  grants program is open for applications from not-for-profit organisations including local  community groups, sporting clubs and local government entities.

The program is part of the Government’s $71 million investment in social cohesion initiatives  to build stronger communities.

Minister for Youth and Sport, Richard Colbeck said the grants will also contribute to the  Government’s plan to make Australia the world’s most active sporting nation.

“Playing sport and engaging in physical activity is great for our physical and mental health, so  we want to make sure more Aussies get more active, more often,” Minister Colbeck said.

“Our Government’s national Sport 2030 plan is to make Australia the world’s most active  sporting nation, and to do that we need everyone joining in.

“We have also invested $190 million to grassroots sporting infrastructure to encourage female  participation, because everyone should feel welcome at their local sporting club.”

Minister for Immigration, Citizenship, Migrant Services and Multicultural Affair David  Coleman said getting involved in sport was a great way for migrants to build connections,  improve English language skills and feel more at home.

“Sport plays an important role in the lives of so many Australians and is a great way to bring  communities together and strengthen Australia’s multicultural successes,” Minister Coleman  said.



“So many of our greatest athletes have migrated to Australia, and the achievements in sport of  people of all backgrounds is a key part of the Australian story.



“We want everyone to feel welcome to join in at our local sporting clubs and it is important  we provide a helping hand for people to get involved.
