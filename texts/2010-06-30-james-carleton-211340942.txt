INTERVIEW WITH JAMES CARLETON

ABC RADIO NATIONAL BREAKFAST

WEDNESDAY, 30 JUNE 2010

SUBJECTS: Prime Minister Julia Gillard, Resource Super Profits  Tax, election timing, religion, Cooper Review into superannuation

JAMES CARLETON:

Joining us now, we have the Minister for Financial Services, Chris Bowen,  and the Manager of Opposition Business, Christopher Pyne. Gentlemen,  good morning to you both.

CHRIS BOWEN:

Good morning, James. Good morning, Christopher.

CHRISTOPHER PYNE:

Good morning, James.

CARLETON:

Good to have you on, thanks. Let's start with you, Christopher, first,  Christopher Pyne. Is Australia, in your view, any different at all under  Prime Minister Julia Gillard than it was under Kevin Rudd?

PYNE:

Well, no it's not, James, and it's a good question. Obviously, the  Government wants to trick the public into thinking by changing the jockey  they've somehow changed the horse as well. But the truth is all they've  done is given the Government a facelift. The Government is still exactly  the same. The new Prime Minister is part of the gang of four, the Deputy  Prime Minister for the last three years, Acting Prime Minister for 21 per  cent of the time that Labor has been in power, and wears every single  bad decision of this Government, whether it's pink batts, school hall rip-offs, the boats arriving, mining tax, the emissions trading scheme being  junked, as much as the previous Prime Minister did.

CARLETON:

Chris, Chris Bowen, can I put the same question to you? Is Australia  different under Prime Minister Gillard as it was under Prime Minister  Rudd?

BOWEN:

Well, James, every Prime Minister puts their own stamp on the  Government; that's why governments are named after the Prime  Ministers: Howard, Rudd, Gillard. And Julia, being a very formidable  political and policy operator, will be putting her stamp on the  Government. She's already signalled a change of focus and she'll be  putting her stamp on it without question. And when you change the Prime  Minister, you change the Government, and you change the focus and the  approach. There's no question about that, despite Christopher's spin.

CARLETON:

But Chris Bowen, still with you, you were at the critical Cabinet meeting.  Do you, can you tell us whether we'll have a resolution to the mining tax  debate any time soon?

BOWEN:

Well, we've signalled that's a priority for us to sort that through. I'm not  going to go through yesterday's Cabinet discussion, you'll be shocked to  learn. But we've signalled that's a priority. There's been intensive  discussions between Wayne Swan and Martin Ferguson, in particular.

CARLETON:

And you would be keenly aware, Minister, wouldn't you, that unless this is  resolved soon, it will crash into the buffer time at which you need to stop  negotiations because you'll be going into caretaker mode.

BOWEN:

Well, that comes into the whole question of election timing, which is a  separate issue. But look, from day one, the Prime Minister said she  wanted this sorted out, that she wanted to get a fairer share of the value  of Australia's mineral wealth for Australians, but she wanted to do so in a  way which was consultative and which the mining industry was listened  to, and that's what she's been doing together with Wayne Swan and  Martin Ferguson over the recent period, and there'll be further updates  when we're in a position to provide further updates.

CARLETON:

How long do you reckon the Government has before Minister, or the  miners rather, start up with their campaign again?

BOWEN:

Well, look, I don't think you can put an artificial timeline on these things.  I know there's some people out there speculating about the end of the  week, etcetera, that's from some people in the mining industry. Others  may have a different view. You've just got to do what you can with the  information and the time you have available, and that is what the  Government's doing. I don't think you can, you know, say, 'Well, we've  got until this date, or anything that happens after this date is a failure;  anything that happens before this date is a screaming success.' The Prime  Minister has indicated that's a priority and we've been dealing with it as a  priority.

CARLETON:

Is that how you see it, Christopher Pyne?

PYNE:

Well, obviously the Government is in something of a cleft stick, James,  because on the one hand either they stick with their very bad mining tax  and plunge a knife through the heart of our standard of living in this  country in the mining industry or they back down on the mining tax and  in so doing they wreck their Budget. Let's not forget they planned a  surplus in three years' time, if you can believe it, of $1 billion. Now, if  they cut the mining tax, if they back down, then essentially they will be  wrecking the Budget. They'll need to have a mini Budget announced;  they're either going to have cuts to the Budget or they're simply going to  abandon their surplus. The bottom line is these people are amateurs and  it's an amateur hour operation, and it's time to get people into the  Government who actually know how to balance a Budget, pay back debt,  reduce the deficit and get Australia back on track again.

CARLETON:

Christopher Pyne, the assessment is, it's widely considered that the  leadership change was bad for the Opposition. What about the proposal  that a mining tax compromise is in the offering? Would that equally be  bad for the Opposition?

PYNE:

Well, you have to recognise of course, James, that the fact that there'll be  a mining tax backdown indicates, of course, the decision the Government  made, that Julia Gillard made in the first place was a bad decision.

CARLETON:

So it should be changed?

PYNE:

Well, this Government reels from one disaster after another. If it's not  pink batts and the school halls rip-off program, and opening the borders  to boat people and junking the emissions trading scheme, it's introducing  a very bad tax and then backing down from the very bad tax. Now, I  don't think the public would give the Government any credit for trying to  introduce a very bad tax and then backing down from a very bad tax. The  public would say, 'Why did you try and introduce it in the first place?'  because they [inaudible] the people running the Government have no  idea what they're doing.

Last Thursday, Chris Bowen was on this program saying that everybody  was sticking with Kevin Rudd, they were behind Kevin Rudd. By the end  of the day, Kevin Rudd was gone.

CARLETON:

Chris Bowen, your reaction?

BOWEN:

Putting aside Christopher's gratuitous comment at the end, we were  talking about the mining tax and Christopher knows that he's not telling  the truth there.

PYNE:

[inaudible]

BOWEN:

Hang on, you had your go, Christopher, and I listened to you in silence.  Settle down.

Now, Christopher knows that he's not telling the truth. I thank him for  reminding us that we are returning to surplus in three years' time, three  years ahead of time. That is not related to the Resource Super Profits  Tax. That is related to the Government's Budget rules of keeping  spending growth under two per cent in real terms and it's related to the  strength of the economy. And we will return the Budget to surplus in  three years' time, three years ahead of time. The revenue from the  Resource Super Profits Tax did not go to paying down the deficit or going  into surplus. Christopher knows that and he's being disingenuous by

speculating otherwise. The revenue from the Resource Super Profits Tax  is earmarked for three things: for boosting superannuation, for a  corporate tax cut and for an infrastructure fund, and to suggest that  there'll need to be some sort of mini Budget or that the surplus will be in  question if there are any changes to the Resource Super Profits Tax is  simply not true.

CARLETON:

And Chris Bowen, can you guarantee that the increase to super will stay,  because you would be personally devastated if it went?

BOWEN:

Well, our commitment to superannuation is very, very strong, unlike the  Opposition. We pioneered the superannuation system in Australia, as a  Labor Government, and we are the ones committed to superannuation  and boosting it. There's no question about that. When we deal with the  Resource Super Profits Tax, we'll obviously make announcements about  any implications that those changes may or may not have, but our  commitment to superannuation remains undiminished.

CARLETON:

I want to turn to the question of faith and religion, because it has re-emerged. Julia Gillard, she says she grew up in the Baptist Church but  she now describes herself as agnostic. The Prime Minister says she will  never pretend to be something she isn't.

JULIA GILLARD:

[grab] I am not going to pretend a faith I don't feel, and for people of  faith I think the greatest compliment I could pay to them is to respect  their genuinely held beliefs and not to engage in some pretence about  mine. I've never thought it was the right thing for me to go through  religious rituals for the sake of appearance.

CARLETON:

Christopher Pyne, you would consider that perhaps quite a deft political  positioning, true to her secular views and yet entirely open to those of  faith?

PYNE:

Look, I don't think that it's a deft political position. I think what it's  designed to do is get her through an election. But everybody has to make  their own choices in terms of faith and belief. I'm a committed Catholic,

Tony Abbott is a committed Catholic, and that's our choice. Good luck to  us. Julia Gillard, I understood she was an atheist but now she's  apparently describing herself as an agnostic. But whether she's an atheist  or an agnostic -

CARLETON:

She's certainly not a Christian socialist.

PYNE:

She's a non-believer and good luck to her. That's her personal choice.  [inaudible] one of the good things about Australia is that happily  sectarianism was left behind decades ago and we certainly don't want to  breathe life back into that again. So I'll go on being a Catholic and Tony  Abbott'll go on being a Catholic, and Julia Gillard can go on being an  atheist and good luck to her and good luck to us.

CARLETON:

You'd have common ground, Chris Bowen, with Christopher Pyne on that  score, wouldn't you?

BOWEN:

Well, with the exception of his comment about Julia's comments about  religion being related to an election, which I completely and utterly reject.  I think it's a good thing in Australia that we can, as politicians and people  in public life, have a range of things informing our values. All of us in  public life or in politics have a set of values. For some of us, that's  inspired and informed by religion. For others of us, it's inspired and  informed by more secular experiences. And both of those should be very  much respected, and I think it would be very sad if Australia got to the  point which, frankly, the United States has, where politicians have to  pretend to be Christians even if they're not, quite clearly sometimes  spectacularly are not, but have had to pretend to be Christians through  their political career. I don't think we've been in that situation in Australia  and nor should we be, and just as people's religious views should be  respected, so should those that are more secular in their approach.

CARLETON:

We're speaking with the Minister for Financial Services, Chris Bowen; also  the Manager of Opposition Business, Christopher Pyne. It's Polls Apart,  ABC radio National Breakfast at 8.17.

Christopher Pyne, do you agree with your colleague Joe Hockey when he  reckons the election will be called this weekend?

PYNE:

Look, I think the election will be called very soon. Labor want to have an  election before the honeymoon for the new Prime Minister ends. Whether  it's called this weekend or next weekend is probably immaterial. The  reality is it'll be in August. It could be as early as 7 August if called this  weekend or 14 August as each weekend passes. The bottom line is Labor  is trying to trick the Australian people into believing there's been a  change of Government because there's been a change of Prime Minister.  There hasn't been. Julia Gillard was involved, as part of the gang of four,  in every bad decision that this Government has made and I don't believe  the Australian public will be fooled. It's one thing to change the face of  the Government, but all the people who made the amateur hour decisions  which have caused all the problems in Australia in the last three years are  still there, still making those decisions, highlighted by the fact that  apparently this Government had lost its way, according to Ms Gillard last  week, but the Cabinet remains almost entirely intact this week. So all  they really did was say, 'Kevin Rudd is going to lose the election. Let's  change the face of the Government, do some public relations, give  ourselves a makeover and that will fool the Australian public into re-electing us.' Now, that is going to be the key issue at the election: are the  people fooled or do they want a Government that is not going to manage  the economy badly, that's not going to try and introduce bad taxes, that  will protect the borders and reduce debt?

CARLETON:

I'm going to take a wild guess, Chris Bowen, that you want to reframe  that question before [inaudible]?

BOWEN:

Well, no, I'm happy to deal with the matter of an election. I notice the  Liberal Party's been out there saying, 'Oh, the Labor Party might rush to  an election to avoid scrutiny.' I mean, what a disingenuous approach.  What greater scrutiny is there than an election on both sides? It might  mean the Liberal Party actually has to come up with a policy, which I  know is a novel idea, that they might actually have to come up with some  sort of alternative approach. Health policy wouldn't be a bad place to  start, which is so important to the Australian people. The Government's  outlined its plans for restructuring Australia's health system, training  more doctors and nurses. The Opposition has been deathly silent. If and  when there's an election - it will be soon, in the next few months - then  the Opposition will need to, as the alternative Government of Australia,  they'll actually need to stump up some policies, and the [inaudible] one  liners and personal abuse that Tony Abbott specialises in will need to be  replaced with an alternative vision, and I think he'll be found lacking.

CARLETON:

And Chris Bowen, last word for you today. We know there's going to be a  major superannuation industry report handed to the Government today.  When are we going to see that?

BOWEN:

I'll be releasing it in the not too distant future, James. I won't be  releasing it today, but I won't be sitting on it for weeks either. I'll be  releasing it quite soon, and of course this is the third stage of our very  significant reforms to super. The first stage was our reforms to financial  advice that I announced on 26 April. The next stage came with our boost  to the superannuation guarantee and other measures to boost the  fairness of superannuation that we announced on 2 May. The third stage  will be our reforms to the efficiency of the superannuation system to get  fees lower, and when you put these three reforms together, we would  have over the last few months completely changed the Australian  superannuation system in a way that hasn't been seen since Paul Keating  introduced superannuation in 1992, and that will be a change for the  better. It will mean that Australians can live with a more comfortable  retirement income and our national savings rate will be boosted, and  that's something, frankly, that I'm very proud about, that this  Government's been able to achieve. It's something the previous  Government just simply never tackled.

CARLETON:

Christopher, you'll have the last word next week. Thank you both for  being with us this morning.

BOWEN:

Nice talking to you, James.

PYNE:

Thank you very much.
