Labor should vote for Petro bills - Brown

31st May 2005



The Greens will be voting for Petro Georgiou’s private members bills  and so should Labor, Greens Senator Bob Brown said today.

“These private members bills are a remarkable breakthrough against  the inhumanity of John Howard’s asylum seeker regime,” Senator  Brown said.

“Today’s announcement that Labor supports the private members bill  but may not vote for them looks like a spinning top at the wobbling  stage.

“Labor should back Petro’s bills lock, stock and barrel.

“The Greens will help foster the legislation in the Senate. We are  prepared to introduce the bills in the upper house if no Liberal Senator  is willing.
