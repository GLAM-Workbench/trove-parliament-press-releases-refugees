Joint Statementwith the Prime Minister of  Malaysia  SAT 07 MAY 2011

Prime Minister, Prime Minister of Malaysia

The Malaysian and Australian Governments have today announced a commitment to enter  into a groundbreaking new arrangement to help tackle people smuggling and irregular  migration in the Asia-Pacific region.

The Malaysian Prime Minister, Hon. Dato’ Sri Najib Tun Razak, and the Australian Prime  Minister, The Hon Julia Gillard MP, have agreed to enter into a new bilateral arrangement as  part of the Regional Cooperation Framework agreed to at the recent Bali Process Ministerial  Conference in Bali on 30 March 2011.

The complex nature of irregular migration, which is closely linked to the crimes of human  trafficking and people smuggling, cannot be solved by acting alone but must be tackled by  countries forming cooperative arrangements under the auspices of regional and international  frameworks.

The bilateral arrangement will take the form of a cooperative transfer agreement that will see  asylum seekers arriving by sea in Australia transferred to Malaysia. In exchange, Australia  will expand its humanitarian program and take on a greater burden-sharing responsibility for  resettling refugees currently residing in Malaysia.

Prime Ministers Najib and Gillard have agreed that core elements of this bilateral  arrangement will include:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ 800 irregular maritime arrivals, who arrive in Australia after the date of effect of the  arrangement, will be transferred to Malaysia for refugee status determination;  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ in return, over four years, Australia will resettle 4000 refugees already currently  residing in Malaysia;  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ transferees will not receive any preferential treatment over asylum seekers already in

Malaysia;  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ transferees will be provided with the opportunity to have their asylum claims  considered and those in need of international protection will not be refouled;  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ transferees will be treated with dignity and respect and in accordance with human

rights standards; and  Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Australia will fully fund the arrangement.

The implementation of this one off pilot project will be important to undermine the business  model of transnational criminal syndicates, particularly in people smuggling and human  trafficking in this region.

Australia and Malaysia are working closely with the United Nations High Commissioner for  Refugees (UNHCR) and the International Organization for Migration (IOM) to operationalise  the arrangement.

The Malaysian and Australian Governments have asked senior officials to finalise a  Memorandum of Understanding in the near future to set out detailed arrangements.
