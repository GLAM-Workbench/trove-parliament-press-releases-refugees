OPPOSITION GIVES ‘KOSOVO WINTER RECONSTRUCTION 
ALL  OWANCE’ 
GUARDED SUPPORT

Â

Â

The Federal Opposition today expressed guarded support towards the 
Government decision to provide monetary incentives to the Kosovar refugees 
located in Australia, in an attempt to induce their voluntary return 
to their homeland.

Â

Shadow Minister for Immigration Con Sciacca today 
said that while the so called ‘  winter reconstruction allowance ’ made economic sense, it 
still did not address either the question of refugee safety upon their 
return to Kosovo, nor the many calls to allow some of these people the 
opportunity to state their individual cases for refugee status.

Â

‘Economically, it makes sense to spend around $6M 
to encourage these people to go back, given that currently, the operation 
is costing Australian taxpayers around $l0M per month.

Â

Mr Sciacca said that while parts of Kosovo are now 
relatively safe, almost 1000 refugees are from Eastern Kosovo, which 
following the redrawing of national boundaries by NATO is still under 
Serbian influence.

Â

“The Federal Opposition has been saying for many 
months that some of these people would want to remain in Australia and 
that those who had a proven fear of persecution upon their return, should 
be allowed to apply for refugee status.

Â

“For the umpteenth time, the Opposition calls on 
the Government to amend the Kosovo Safe Haven legislation to allow those 
Kosovars who fear for their safety should they return, to be allowed 
to state their case.

Â

“Allowing the Kosovars to apply for refugee status 
will safeguard their safety while at the same time removing them as 
a burden on the public purse, giving them a chance to become productive 
members of the Australian community,” Mr Sciacca said.

Â

Â

‘Operation Safe Haven’, established in April 1999 
is estimated to have cost approximately $90M to date.
