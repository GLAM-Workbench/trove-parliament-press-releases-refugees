Labor Party’s Divisiveness on Community Relations

The Labor Party is attempting to incite unrest among members of our culturally diverse Australian community.

While the Government is committed to national unity, the Labor Party has shown itself to be a party of disunity and instability.

In an address in Parliament last night, I cited three examples:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The Qld Parliamentary Secretary to the Premier and Minister responsible for Multicultural Affairs, Daryl Briskey, and Simon Crean’s Shadow Minister for Innovation, Industry, Trade, Tourism, Craig Emerson, making inflammatory comments which have caused distress to the Vietnamese community.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ An African and Latin American Festival in Brisbane was used as a platform for pro-Labor political speeches, showing the division that exists within the Qld Government on the matter of refugee policy. The Qld Education Minister Anna Bligh showed herself to be completely at odds with her Premier in her comments. This led to a letter of complaint by 53 members of the African community.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The Labor Party is trying to create a great deal of divisiveness in the Sydney Muslim community by trying to spread propaganda and whip up unnecessary fear about the Government’s increased community safety measures, including the ASIO bill. We have reassured the Muslim community the facts do not support the smear campaign run by the ALP.

The Government is determined that all members of the Australian community unite in a single purpose of contributing to the building of this great nation. For the Labor Party to attempt to cause division along ethnic, racial and religious lines shows they are more interested in harming the process of national unity than making a worthwhile contribution.

Many members of the communities mentioned have made exceptional contributions to Australia and have worked hard to succeed in our society. They deserve better from the Australian Labor Party.
