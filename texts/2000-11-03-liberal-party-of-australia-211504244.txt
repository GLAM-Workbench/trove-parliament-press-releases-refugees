Boat under Customs radar coverage

Australian Customs Vessel Wauri and Coastwatch kept a suspect vessel under radar coverage until interception was made at Ashmore Islands late yesterday afternoon, the Minister for Justice and Customs, Senator Amanda Vanstone, said today.

Customs Coastwatch co-ordinated the interception by the Wauri which was patrolling the area around the Ashmore Islands

The vessel, an Indonesian fishing vessel, was carrying 69 suspected illegal entrants. On board were 49 males, 10 women and 10 children of middle-eastern origin, with three Indonesian crew.

Senator Vanstone said the Samson Explorer, the chartered Customs vessel dedicated to transporting illegal arrivals, was on its way to the islands to ferry the suspected illegal entrants to the mainland, where the crew and passengers will be handed over to Immigration officials.
