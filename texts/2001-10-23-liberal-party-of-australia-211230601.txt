MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS BEAZLEY’S DISGRACEFUL OPPORTUNISM ON BOAT PEOPLE

23 October 2001

Kim Beazley has demonstrated he is unfit to lead this country.

His comments on the loss of up to 400 lives in the sinking of a boat off Indonesia are a deplorable display of political opportunism.

Mr Beazley’s appalling slur - that this tragedy is a ‘failure of policy’ by the Howard Government - demonstrates Mr Beazley lacks the discipline and conviction to lead this country. His only interest is in the cheap political shot.

The responsibility for the loss of life in this tragedy rests with the people smugglers who continue to ply their dismal trade.

It is a practice that Australia, working with Indonesia and other countries in our region and beyond, is committed to stopping.

Political grand-standing and rhetoric were a feature of Labor foreign policy during Mr Beazley’s last term in government. Nothing has changed since then.
