STATEMENT

The conflict in Israel and the Palestinian Territories

The Australian Government must use its position on the United Nations Security Council  to push for an immediate ceasefire in Israel and the Palestinian Territories.

With reports of more than 1300 dead, including many children, the fighting must end  now.

Labor is appalled by the recent shelling of a UN school in a Gaza refugee camp, and  attacks on similar facilities.

Labor deplores the abuse of civilian facilities for military purposes, including a Gaza  school that was used to hide rockets.

Hamas must stop firing rockets into Israel - more than 2600 so far, and Israel must  restrain its response, which has cost far too many civilian lives.

The scale of human suffering has shocked the world.

Australia needs to work urgently with the international community to bring this terrible  conflict to an end.
