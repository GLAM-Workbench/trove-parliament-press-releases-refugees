E&EO…………………………………………………………………………………………..

LEON BYNER:

Let's talk to Immigration Minister Peter Dutton. Peter we seem to be - and thank you  for joining us today - we seem to be accruing a longer, longer list of people who for  all sorts of reasons ought to be deported, but you can't get them out.

PETER DUTTON:

Well Leon, good to be on the show, so thank you very much for having me on.

Look, it's a growing frustration for everybody and it should be a growing frustration  for the community as well because 99 per cent of people who come to our country  do the right thing, but those people that don't, they need to recognise that if they're  non-citizens, they'll have their visas cancelled. And where they're overturned by the  AAT, in some cases I can overturn that decision, but it is a cumbersome process and  some of the laws that we've got before the Parliament at the moment in relation to  the citizenship space, we do have some reform around the AAT, but we're not able  to get support from the Independent Senators as yet.

LEON BYNER:

See when I had Bill Shorten in the studio not long ago and I think you heard the  quote because I played it on air a couple of times…

PETER DUTTON:

…yes.

LEON BYNER:

He was clear that if people are not genuine refugees or they are proven malcontents,  we don't want them.

So I would've thought it would be a lay down misere for you to be able to change the  rules to make those decisions. Not so?

PETER DUTTON:

No, this is where Bill Shorten frankly gets a bit tricky because he plays on words. In  the Parliament his words are very different than what he has to say on your show  and elsewhere around the country.

So at the moment the Labor Party's saying that they won't support those citizenship  changes.

So what we're saying is that we want people to be of good character, to have abided  by Australian law, to be working if they're of working age, to send their kids to school,  to speak a competent level of the English language - but they're all basic elements  which I think the public would support and at the moment some of the cases you're  talking about; those people do become Australian citizens, they do go on to become  Australian citizens under Labor's model and that's what we're trying to reform.

But at the moment Mr Shorten's being a bit shifty unfortunately and we do have to  rely on the Independent Senators and I'm hoping that Nick Xenophon and his team  will come through with their support.

LEON BYNER:

So this is to change the rules where the AAT can actually be overruled by you  easier? Is that what you want to do?

PETER DUTTON:

That's right and I'll give you one example.

There was a person who was non-citizen here on a visa, he pleaded guilty to and  was convicted of eight sexual offences with a minor, including two of having sexual  intercourse, three counts of assault, an act of indecency and three counts of an act  of indecency. He asked that a further five matters be taken into account. So the eight  offences took place over a period of 14 years and he was convicted and sentenced  to six years imprisonment.

The AAT set aside the decision under review and the decision-maker at the AAT  sent back the application for citizenship to the minister for reconsideration with the  direction this person should now be considered as of good character.

Now I can go through case after case of these Leon and I don't think it reflects  community values or community standards.

I think we need to tighten the law up here. I think we need to be reasonable. People  should have their day in court, but my job is to do all I can to keep Australians safe  and if these people go on to become Australian citizens, they have many more rights  than if they're just visa holders.

I want good people - law abiding people that have contributed to Australian society -  I want those people to become Australian citizens.

I don't want people of questionable character and certainly not those that have  committed serious sexual offences against Australian children to go on to become  Australian citizens and that's why we really need the support in the Parliament for  this Bill.

LEON BYNER:

You know what really gets under people's skin Minister, is that if you for example  want to bring over let's say a student from Latin America who you've got a relative  kind of a cousin relationship, often you'll get knocked back on the basis that this is a  person from a third world country. Statistically they are more likely to overstay their  visa so the answer is ‘no’ and yet we are protecting felons through this AAT process.  That doesn't look good to the public.

PETER DUTTON:

It doesn't look good and that's why we're going to change the law. So we can't act  outside the law and we obviously have to abide by the law which we do. But in some  cases where obviously the decision making process is just plain wrong then we do  need to reform the law.

I believe in this day and age it is important for us to know all we can about a person's  background, all we can about their time in Australia before we grant citizenship,  because as I say, under the Constitution, under the legislation, Australian citizens  rightly are afforded special protections and that's why we need to get it right.

The visa cancellations are now about 2800 over the last couple of years. That's up  quite dramatically and you and I have spoken on the show about this before. But  many of those people under the previous Labor Government would've gone on to  become Australian citizens and they're just not the people that we want to become  Australian citizens.

We want people who are going to work hard, abide by our laws, integrate into  Australian society, to become citizens. And that's why we've got this legislation  before the Parliament at the moment.

Now Mr Shorten has said that he doesn't agree with that and that he can't support  that legislation and in that case we need to rely on the Independent Senators to get  the Bill through the Senate.

LEON BYNER:

Peter Dutton Immigration Minister. Thanks for joining us today.
