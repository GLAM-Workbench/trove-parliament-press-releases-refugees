(Inaudible)

MR PEACOCKi

No, I was not aware of that,  I've nothing further to say at this  juncture. I'm sure that Mr Hawke will be taking every expedient  action he can because he knows that this has blown up in his face  and we’ll wait and see what happens.

JOURNALISTi

... expedient action to look at those document?

MR PEACOCKi

Well, I don't regard examining documents after they've been leaked  to be an expedient action. I don't know what's involved, we'll  wait and see.

JOURNALISTi

But,  if Mr Hawke produces the documents, Mr Peacock, isn't that  prima facie__in abusive due process.

MR PEACOCKi

It seems an extraordinary set of circumstances all along the way,   to me. Firstly, that anybody such as this would leak information)  secondly, that it would occur in an election campaign and thirdly,  of course,  you were led to the conclusion that the crime that  allegedly Mr Elliott may have committed is being Federal President  of the Liberal Party,

Do you accept that you've slurred Lionel Bowen by this accusation?

MR PEACOCKi

I know a little more about the law than you do.

JOURNALISTi

Have you spoken to Mr Elliott? .

MR PEACOCKi

No, I've not.

JOURNALIST* .

But, you won't take up the offer to see the document?

MR PEACOCK*

Well, is there an offer, I mean, I don't know whether there's been  an offer,  an offer what,  from the Attorney General to the Shadow  Attorney General or is he releasing it to you, or what?

JOURNALIST*

The Prime Minister has offered, for you to be briefed by Mr Bowen,   on the allegations.

MR PEACOCKi

Oh well, I would always be prepared to accept a briefing, but I  will not be constrained.  I mean, I receive briefing from Ministers  time and again and it's always on the basis that it does not  constrain me from my criticism. What Is discussed privately

remains so. This has become public and if it’s public knowledge  that he's making an offer, then I can publicly accept it. It's a  strange way of doing it though,  isn't it. Through the media, why  did he not-eorvtect me direct as is the normal process. I mean,   only a couple of weeks ago I received a briefing on one particular  matter from a Minister and it was the normal ground rules. I said,

yes, I'll take the briefing, yes I'll listen to what you have to  say.  I will certainly not divulge it but it will not constrain me  from my criticisms, I regard the criticism to be true.  So, we'll  wait and see and if the documents are to be made available I would  want my Shadow Attorney General to look at them also.

Mr Peacock, on the wage-tax deal there'e Â«till 3 percent pipeline  wages, wage increases to flow through the system, quite apart from  yesterday's announcement. If you win government,  will you honour  those increases or will you go back to the Industrial Relations  Commission and argue that they should .... the Opposition's

productivity gains.

MR PEACOCKS

No, Glenn, what we've indicated there is that what is in the  pipeline is part of a deal that was already implemented by the  previous government and that will have to be honoured.  In regard  to what was announced yesterday, it is part of an election campaign  which they're offering, it is an entirely different matter. But  what is in the pipeline, we believe, has to be honoured.

JOURNAL ISTl

Mr Peacock,  the government's bid is now on the table, what are you  going to do to match it?

MR PEACOCK!

Well, we've already indicated what we'll do for Australian families  and they'll be infinitely better off under us. Quite apart from  what they receive with the family tax cuts,  both child care  allowance, the child tax,  the child tax rebate and the child care

rebate and the increase in eligibility for the dependent spouse  rebate, we are, of course, proffering programs that will reduce  inflation and thereby reduce interest rates and we have programs,   of course, of privatisation and contracting out that will lift both  productivity and the delivery of services.  So, our programs are  down.

JOURNALIST!

Aren't you at a disadvantage though not having some fixed offer in  terms of wages on the table?

MR PEACOCK

I can say to you after yesterday I am in an even advantageous  position than beforehand. I think the reaction all around  Australia, the cynicism not only in terms of the impact that it  will be in beating up the average man or woman's wage,  but also the

political cobbling together and presentation, allegedly, of an  economic statement by a caretaker Treasurer is unprecedent. And,   no, people are seeing through this.  I couldn't believe that they  would present it in the manner that they did.

JOURNALIST!

Mr Peacock,  can you guarantee workers real wage rises under a  Coalition Government?

MR PEACOCK!

You cannot get real wage rises whilst you continue to have a nexus  between inflation,  wages and cost. You have to increase  productivity.  We're the only ones with such a stress, as you know  those who remain in the system, the Commission will be directed to  take account, not only of productivity, but of international

competitiveness of employment with the stress on productivity and  those outside will be negotiating, those who wish to move, will be  negotiating wage increases in line with productivity increases. As  a consequence, you can say to Australian workers confidently with  such a stress on productivity that they will have an increase in  real wages. More to the point, you will also be able to indicate

that we have the appropriate policies to tackle inflation and  thereby getting interest rates down so they'll be infinitely better  off and that's why I've said time and again under Mr Hawke it is  nothing but an offer of the same.  Accord Mark 6 is Just another

shabby deal for Australian workers. We're offering the break from  the past and offering a newer future.

JOURNALIST!

Is it therefore true to say that workers who don't or can't  increase productivity can't expect real wage increases.

MR PEACOCK!

Well, I believe that there can be productivity increases negotiated  and even the Trade Union Movement accept that,  too. Do bear in  mind for those who are worried,  there is in fact the minimum wage  setting that is down, even with voluntary agreements. But, with

the stress on productivity you can have significant increases.

JOURNALIST!

But, if you already have to pay the 5 percent in, that's still in  the pipeline^" this is going to severely restrict anything else that  would be paid in the coming financial year, won't it?

MR PEACOCK!

Are you suggesting to us that we should break that deal? I mean,   that would be unconscionable and we’ve said before, there's nothing  new in me saying that,  in fact, I heard both John Hewson and, and  heard of, Senator Chaney discussing that very point yesterday,

because we've taken that into our calculations.

JOURNAL 1STi

... any other movements in wages if you're committed to the 3  percent (inaudible)

MR PEACOCKi

No, that's not so because we've been able to project forward, which  is more than the government can do. We give you, of course,   estimates of revenue and estimates of expenditure. All they ever  give you as you well know are the forward estimates of expenditure

and they don't put down the revenue factor generally.

JOURNALIST! .

Mr Peacock, will we have to wait until the third budget of your  government to get your tax cuts?

MR PEACOCKi

The, (public announcement interruption)  I'd love to, Id love to and  to the pool as well. Yes,  anything. Ah, now can we go back to that  again, Mike?

JOURNALIST!

Will we have to wait until your third budget to get your tax cuts?

MR PEACOCKi

Well, as you know, the family tax relief, both child tax rebate,   child care rebate, the dependent spouse rebate, the abolition of  the capital gains etc, will be dealt with first of all and that's  all part of what we can prove to you as essentially the first  budget. Then we move into the second and third (year), we have  said that we will have in place our flatter two-tiered tax policy,

in that third year.  And you'll be getting the significant family  tax assistance in our first budget.

JOURNAL 1STi

... on tax cuts?

MR PEACOCKi

Yes,  I Just have.

JOURNALIST!

Can you be more specific?

JOURNALIST!

MR PEACOCKi

Well, I Just have, I've been so specific I've not only told you  what we’re going to do and the particular amounts on the child tax  rebate and the child care rebate, the eligibility for the dependent  spouse rebate, I can fully fund it, I can put it down for the first

budget, Now, they're all tax cuts. .

JOURNALISTi

The question, Mr Peacock, is, will you move towards the two-tier  system during your second year of office or will you only start  moving towards the two-tier system in the third year of office?

MR PEACOCKi

Well, we can make adjustments through the second year, but you'll  recall our goal and our aim is to have it in place in the third  year.

JOURNAL 1STi

So, it's possible that we mightn't have that sort of movement in  the second year, that it might have to wait until the third year?

MR PEACOCKi

No, I've indicated to you that the actual words of the document,  you want to stick to them, as our goal is to have them in place by  the third year and that means that they’ll be introduced in that  period of time. So, we can say to you that family tax cuts will be  down in our first budget and they are significant tax cuts and

they’re not illusory like the government's and they are fully  funded and in terms of the later implementation of the two-tiered  system, it will be in place in that third (year),

JOURNALIST*

Can I quote you, in Toowoomba yesterday Charles Blunt said the  Coalition would only introduce a two-tiered tax system in its third  year of government and only after it was fully funded. Now that  clearly indicates that it will come in the third year, not in the

second.

7

MR PEACOCKÂ·

It is quite clear that it will be introduced in the third year but  we could be moving toward that before then and it will be fully  funded because we can actually tell you what the costing was in  today's terms if we move to it now. You see, we did that costing

to see whether we should do it in the first year, but having cut  *2.7 billion we had the choice of either the *2 billion being used  for family tax cuts immediately or raising or finding another *100  million to implement it immediately. And we chose the family tax

rate first of all. Now, we were able to say to people higher  costings and today's values it would be *2.8 million. And what we  undertake to do is to have that in place in the third (year).

JOURNALIST!

But you cannot guarantee to voters that you will start to cut tax  rates in the second year, you're only saying you could move towards  it in the second year,

MR PEACOCKi

Well, I can give an undertaking that they get significant family  relief in the first year and by and in the third year they will  have the two-tiered system in place. And that's far more  definitive than what my opponents are doing and far more benefit to  Australians.

JOURNALIST!

Mr Peacock, twice so far on talkback radio the subject of  immigration has been raised, are you happy with the way that  immigration is being handled in an irregulatory sense in the way  that the government is applying those regulations,

MR PEACOCKi

Well, we’ve had our concerns with the changes that Senator Ray has  made about the enormous range of changes that he undertook and  we've indicated that we would do a review of these latest  regulations.jtfhlch seem to impact very unfairly on some, so we've

indicated that review. In terms of the wider area, I (inaudible) I  have also indicated, as you know, that there is now a very wide, a  much wider pool available to us through what's transpired in

Eastern Europe. So, I'd be lifting the effort there somewhat, it  doesn't detract from immigration elsewhere. I think in terms of  meeting the needs of shortage of skills in Australia, we would be  silly not to take account of the opportunities of getting skill

transfered.

Now, that is not a change in policy, that's Just a change in  administrative arrangements, to set in place migration officers  throughout Eastern Europe. Where we can with the posts that are  there.

JOURNALIST!

Would you be loosening the current constraints on the family  reunion claim?

MR PEACOCK!

No, family reunion remains, it's a very strong element of our  migration policy.

JOURNALIST!

... loosening the current constraints they're on.

MR PEACOCK*

Well, we'll be reviewing the latest changes, but in general we've  always got to say the family reunion is to remain a compassion  approach to immigration. It picks up that element of our  responsibi1ities on refugees, which we have, and have always been  compassionate. In fact, when we were in government we achieved a  situation where we took more boat people per head of population

than any other country in the world and it was at that period of  time that I was being ... by the then President of the ACTU, Mr  Hawke, on this very issue. But he seems to have had a change of  mind since he has had responsibllity for it. It showed a degree of

... in the way in which he swung from one extreme to the other.

JOURNALIST!

(inaudible)

MR PEACOCK!

Oh, well if you'd like one, I'd like to give you one. Of course,  of course in the next few days we might look at that and do it for  you, all right? Very happy to do it? I'm happy standing up but if  you want to sit down, that's alright, yeah. Politicians are always

interested in seats.
