Address b y .  Senator Gareth. Evans, Australian Minister

for Foreign Affairs and'Trade, to the Opening '6 t  Â£' Session of the ASEAN Post Ministerial Conference,

Jakarta, 27 July 1990. Â·

Mr Chairman .  "  .  .  .

Excellencies

Distinguished Participants .

Ladies and Gentlemen .

May I commence my remarks by expressing my own and

my delegation's sincere gratitude to our host. His  Excellency Ali Alatas, Chairman both of the recent

ASEAN Ministerial Meeting and of this Post-

Ministerial Conference, and to the Indonesian

Government, for the warmth of their welcome and- the

generosity of their hospitality.

In the two years' that All Alatas has been Foreign

Minister of Indonesia we have come to respect

greatly his knowledge, his wisdom, his experience,

ana his great thoughtfulness as a host. He has

been a leader of great effectiveness within a s s a n ,

’on the wider regional and international stage and

certainly in the development of the presently very

warm bilateral relationship between Australia and

Indonesia. We know that he will guide us well in  our deliberations here.

For more than forty years, mankind has lived with

the knowledge that it could destroy itself - and for  more than forty years, Â·  that knowledge has

constituted the basic organising principle of world  affairs, what has happened over the last few years

is scarcely believable to those who have lived

through those four decades. it is a curious thing,

however, that as t h e .  totally extraordinary becomes

wholly commonplace - as we greet with little more

2

than the raising of an .  eyebrow the Soviet Union's

agreement to a reunified Germany remaining in NATO - Â·   there is nonetheless still seme sense of disquiet

about the future and what it might bring. Perhaps  this unease reflects the fact that, however

unpalatable past certainties may have been, at least  they were certainties. Ac a prominent Soviet has

asked: “What are you going to do now that you no

longer have ua for an enemy?"

That is a good question, not just for the United

States and the Europeans, but for those of us who  live in this cart of the world. It is true that the

impact of the fundamental change in East/West  relations has been manifested most dramatically in

Europe. But it is also true that these fundamental

changes in East/west relations have had a rather

more immediate impact on the Asia Pacific region

than perhaps Is often acknowledged.

For example, Soviet "out of area" maritime

deployments, and activity at Cam Ranh Bay, have

significantly reduced. The ice has been broken in

talks between President Gorbachev and President Roh-

North Korea, in its own special way, seems to be

struggling to muster the courage to ,  taka some

tentative first steps towards an opening to other  states. There is rapidly growing pressure for major

political and economic reform in Mongolia. And the  rise of democracy as a force that is eventually

unstoppable has confronted the military ruler's of

Myanmar with the will of the people: I hope in this

respect that all of us will find ways of urging

those rulers to heed that will - by commencing

immediately a dialogue with the elected

representatives of the people to make arrangements

for the transfer of government authority to them.

3

Not everything has been positive, of course.  Both

China and Vietnam have reacted to events in East  Europe by a retreat from their moves towards

political liberalisation. But what is finally true  is that this part ,  of the world will inescapably have

to develop new priorities, new ways of thinning, '  and  eventually new structures and institutions, to cope

with the long-term fall-out ofÂ· "the change in the  East/West dynamic. And in this, ASEAN will play a

central role.

To say that ASEAN has been a success story is a

truism. But given that the thing about truisms is

that they are true, it does no harm to reiterate  them from time to time. ASEAN has provided a vital

confidence building mechanism between its member  states. It has presented to the world a group of

states which are .economically vibrant, confident

that they net only have a right to be heard but the

standing to ensure that they will be heard, and

determined to shape their own destiny rather than

having it thrust upon them- The vision of those who

founded ASEAN in 1967 has been realised.

1 recall ASEAN1  *  *  *  *  *  7s success in the .past only as a prelude to making the point that ASEAN will

unquestionably play a central role in creating the future. I say that not just for the negative reason

that ASEAN has the power to ensure that nothing can

"happen in this part of the world that it does not

want to happen. Bather, I say it because the very  resilience, unity, and pragmatism which have

characterised ASEAN7s past successes are the very  factors which will make It a positive, force in

dealing with the uncertainties and challenges we now

face.

4

One immediate example is AFBC." ASEAN has —

correctly net regarded APEC as an alternative to  ASEAN itself. Rather, it has seen APEC for what it

is: a broader regional framework for creating a freer trading environment and for stimulating ever

further economic benefit, which no more challenges

ASEAN than, in a different context, the Conference

on Security and Cooperation in Europe - the CSCE -

challenges the EC. It has been the support and

drive of ASEAN and its member states which have  meant that this proposal has not been, like its

predecessors, still-born, but has passed through its

difficult first months of life and has emerged, If

not yet mature r  at least as a lusty infant.

In security terms, there has been the beginning of

debate and dialogue about new concepts and new

approaches,  and this is reflected in the ASEAN

Foreign Ministers' communique and in our agenda. As

I said in a speech last week (which I labelled,

incidentally - I hope you will think not too

presumptuously - "Australia's Asian Future") , while

it is too early to try to map out in detail what

might evolve, it is not too early to be asking

questions about what kind of wholly new institutions  .  might be capable of evolving in Asia, as they did in

Europe, as a framework for addressing and resolving

security problems. we can, for example,  ask why we

should not seek to put together a Conference on

Security and. co-operation in Asia - a c s c a - similar

to the CSCE, perhaps in the first instance c.n a

sub-regional basis, then oyer time on a more allÂ­ embracing basis.

There are a number of negative responses which c a n ,

and no ti.oubt will, quickly be given to that question

(which is one that I know Joe Clark and others have

also been asking in recent times): because, it viJ i

5

be said., Asia contains many .different, issues of

contention and has many different "fronts’1, xml ike  Europe where there has been a single East-West

conflict;.  because Asia is a diverse and non-

homogeneous region, with little of the sense of

common cultural identity and .  common diplomatic  tradition of Europe; and so on. But for all that,

it is not unreasonable to hope and expect that new

Europe-style patterns of cooperation between old

adversaries will find their echo in this part of the

world,Â· and that imaginative new approaches to

confidence-building and problem-solving can be

found.

It may be one day that a CSCA will be seen as

timely- But if it should ba, it will be because a

process of dialogue has begun to build confidence

and patterns of co-operation not only between old

friends but between old adversaries. If such a

process is pursued, sooner or later a base will

emerge on which a more systematic security

architecture can be built.

This ASEAN Post-Ministerial Meeting is a highly

appropriate forum for carrying forward this kind of

dialogue. .  ASEAN has built networks of mutual

interest, respect and familiarity among neighbouring

countries which have had the potential to pose  security concerns for each other. The ASEAN

.  countries are continually seeking to develop a web  or co-operative relationships that strengthen their

mutual reassurance. So over the coming years,

instead of the downward thrust of communism, which

the last generation feared, we nay well see the  spread northwards and southwards of this approach

which. ASEAN has successfully applied within its cwn  membership.  .  Â·

6

..-V

One issue which is not a product of the new

international landscape so. much as a lingering .   byproduct, of the old is that of Indochinese refugees

- and it is a problem which very much preoccupies

ail of us here. Australia fully supports ASEAN in

wanting the complete Comprehensive Plan of Action Â·   implemented. Vie have made absolutely clear our own

position on the logic, the legitimacy and the

Ultimate inevitability of the repatriation of those

who cannot satisfy the accepted criteria of refugee

status.

But at the same time we think it would be unhelpful

to the resolution of differences if we were now tc

dig deeply into our respective trenches. This is a .  difficult and emotional issue,  and we need to. work

hard to find if there is some common ground on which  we can compromise.  While that search for common

ground continues, we consider it important and,

moreover, appropriate to the kind of relationship we

all have with each other, that no irrevocable action

bs taken by any of us, such as abandoning

precipitately the principle of first asylum. I

I have left until last the central regional problem  with which we are all still confronted: Cambodia-I-have left this until last because I wanted first

to sketch the backdrop against which the Cambodian

problem should now be seen. In the past Cambodia

has been seen as a Â·  great human tragedy - and it is

of course still that. It has been seen as the

single greatest focus of instability and security

concern to the countries, of the region - and -it is

still, that. But it is now mere than that. If we

are to re-shape the region's security environment,

develop fully its economic institutions, and address

the root of the Indo-Chinese refugee problem, we

7

cannot do so fully without a " resolution of the  Cambodian problem- .

Public attention over the last several days has been

focussed on the adjustment in policy by the united  States- That is hardly surprising: differences of

view are always much more interesting to the media

than the dull business of consensus. I do not want

to say much more here about the revised United

States approach, except to observe that Australia

could hardly be expected to do other than feel very

comfortable with it, since it is the policy approach

we ourselves have taken for some ten years. Â·'

What 1 do want to stress, however, is that in all  the drama of recent events, we should none of us

forget that we all remain united about the

fundamentals of this issue. Everything that ASEAN

Foreign Ministers have said in recent days confirms  me in that view. Â·

We are all committed to achieving a comprehensive

settlement which is supported by China and ‘  is

accepted" by all the Cambodian parties, including the

Khmor Rouge. I find no great moral dilemma, in this.

Certainly, we can never and must never forget the  horror that the Khmer Rouge inflicted on its own

people little more than a decade ago. Yet the

simple fact ie that, in the absence of a

comprehensive settlement supported by China and

accepted by the Khmer Rouge, the Cambodian tragedy

will continue. it will be -the Cambodian people

themselves who will suffer if we walk away now from

the hard, gruelling, thankless and seemingly endless  search for such a settlement. Australia sees

nothing that is either sensible or moral in such a  course, so long as there remains a real chance that

a comprehensive settlement can be achieved.

8

T-fc would be especially foolish to walk away frca the  comprehensive settlement path at the very time when  t h e .prospects of such a comprehensive settlement are

in fact better than they have, ever been, we are all  familiar with the- disappointments and frustrations

of dealing with .  this issue, with hope ebbing and

flowing. And wa have had differences of view, from

time to time, about tactics - whether particular

moves at particular times have been productive or

counter-productive.

But I think it important to recognise that since  late 1989, the underlying movement has been wholly

positive, with the various regional meetings and the  work of the Permanent Five members of the Security

Council all now focusing productively on a central

idea - an enhanced role for the UN, not just in the

now relatively familiar area of elections

organisation and peace-keeping, but in the new

domain of civil administration in the transitional  period leading up to free and fair elections. Last

week's meeting of the Permanent 5 achieved major  "  breakthroughs on the two most difficult issues

involved in a comprehensive settlement — namely the

military. '  arrangements and the transitional

administrative arrangements.  .

So we have moved from a situation last year, where

there were many different roads, to a situation  where we now have one road, whose broad direction

has been mapped out. The next bridge to cross on

that road, a crucial one if any further progress is

to be made, is the establishment of the Supreme  National Council. ASEAN Foreign Ministers have

correctly identified the establishment of a Supreme  National Council as being an urgent necessity, with

its occupancy of the Cambodian seat at the United

9

Nations consigning to Irrelevance the vexed question  of whether or not to declare Ã¢ÂÂ   that seat vacant- I  believe we should unite around this ASEAN approach,

and should direct all' our efforts in coning weeks to

convincing all the Cambodian parties, and their

supporters, that they should constitute this body as '   scon as possible.

in all of this, i think that there may be value In

this conference sending a particular message to

Vietnam- I do not believe that any of us here bear  any malice or hostility towards Vietnam, and its

present leadership - certainly that is true Â·  of

Australia. On the contrary, and for all the reasons

X outlined earlier, all of us see it as important

for the future order of our region that Vietnam,

along with the other countries cf Jndo-China, and  Myanmar, should be engaged constructively and

positively in the mainstream of the region's

affairs. But that will not happen until the

Cambodian problem is. resolved, and it will not be  resolved if major players like Vietnam adopt old-

style approaches of seeking to wear down the stamina  and patience of others. Such an approach will

certainly fail. Vietnam has moved over the last

.several months,. but It needs to do more, not in the

old spirit of winners and losers, but in the new

spirit of co-operative endeavour where all parties

can he winners. Such a new approach is net just in

the interests of the countries around this table,

but is very much in Vietnam's own interests.

X think it would be helpful — and this is the last

point I want to make - if this Conference were to  specifically address the question of process on

Cambodia: the next steps that might now be taken to

pull together t he.  threads of progress made at tha

various regional meetings, and by the Permanent 5

10

deliberations, and to bring the whole process to

conclusion. The Permanent 5 meetings have been  extremely important in - forging consensus on basic

principles, and they should unquestionably continue.  But, as the ASEAN Ministers have themselves now

flagged in their communique, there is only one

context in which all the threads can ultimately be

brought together (and, among other things, the  endless procedural wrangling over Cambodian  representation addressed and resolved) - and that is  the Paris International conference on Cambodia,

under the Co-chairmanship of Indonesia and France.

While the time is not yet quite ripe to reconvene

the Conference itself - we all know the ground has

to be very thoroughly prepared for that - the time

is ripe, in Australia's judgment for the Co-Chairman  to now play an active role in moving the process

forward- They might perhaps best do that by

embarking on an extended process of conciliations

with the Cambodian and other parties, focusing their

discussions on a single draft negotiating text

prepared by the Co-Chairman, with such help as they

might want to call upon, in a way which pulls

together the threads of progress made at the various

regional meetings and F5 deliberations.

If such -consultations were able to begin soon, and

involve in the first instance the Co-Chairman

meeting with the Cambodian parties, this could serve

as the means to conclude quickly the question of the

composition of the Supreme National Council, and to  have it establiahed in time to occupy the Cambodian

seat at the Forty-Fifth Session of the CJNGA which

begins in late September.

11

what Is most important: or all, however, is that this

Conference should unite in conveying to the world  the sense or urgency this conference feels, and the

need to maintain the momentum that has been

achieved. Â·' The Cambodian people have suffered war

and unimaginable horror for two decades. It is time'  for us to make clear to all the protagonists that  enough is enough. Â·
