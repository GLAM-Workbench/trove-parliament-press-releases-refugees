TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW SKY AUSTRALIAN AGENDA WITH   PETER VAN ONSELEN AND PAUL KELLY



Date: 21 July 2013  Topics: Asylum Seekers, Climate Change, FBT

PETER VAN ONSELEN:    To discuss the issue of climate change first up, we're joined now  out of Adelaide by the Climate Change Minister Mark Butler. Mr  Butler, welcome to the program.

MARK BUTLER:                 Morning, Peter.

PETER VAN ONSELEN:    We are going to focus, obviously, on climate change, but just a  quick question to start if I can, on this announcement from Friday  in relation to the boats. You're a senior factional member of the  Labor Party left. There has to be some disquiet, doesn't there,  within the broad Labor movement - but certainly within the left  you would think - about a policy that appears to be as harsh as  this, as Paul Kelly talks about?

MARK BUTLER:                 Well I think the Prime Minister was pretty frank at the  announcement on Friday - there would be people within the  Labor movement and the Labor Party, and the broader  community, who would feel uncomfortable with this. But in my  discussions with some people over the last couple of days,  although you know, there is a level of discomfort about some  aspects of this, there is also a very strong and clear recognition  that something very different needs to be done.

The numbers, the ruthlessness with which people smugglers are

putting people - including very young children - on these leaky  boats, the number of people we're losing on the seas means that  business as usual is simply unacceptable. So yes there is a level  of discomfort I'm sure in parts of the Labor Party and the Labor  movement, but there's a very strong recognition that this sort of  game-changer is needed to start to arrest the numbers of people  coming over from Indonesia in particular.

PAUL KELLY:                      Just on that point Minister, given the appalling nature of the  detention conditions in Papua New Guinea, are you prepared to  live with the idea that women, and children and family groups will  be sent there to those conditions?

MARK BUTLER:                 Well I think a range of these details will be fleshed out, and I  know you're talking to Bob Carr who's had much more

involvement in these arrangements than I have. But the Prime  Minister again made clear on Friday that there'd be very strong  supports put in place for these resettlement arrangements in  PNG in terms of health services, education services and the like.  Over coming days and weeks I'm sure we'll see details of that  fleshed out. But I know there's a very broad recognition,  including by the Prime Minister and Minister Burke and I'm sure  Minister Carr, that PNG is going to need - and deserves - some  assistance from Australia in some of those services.

PETER VAN ONSELEN:    We will pass that political hot potato on to Bob Carr after the  break where we'll talk to him about it. Let's move on if we can, to  your portfolio area of climate change. It's rhetoric gone over the  top, isn't it, for Kevin Rudd to describe himself as the terminator  of the carbon tax? At the end of the day, all that's happening  here is the floating price is being brought forward by twelve  months, and that's only happening if the Government actually  changes legislation, and that's unlikely to happen before the  election. We're just talking about an election promise here, rather  than any actual change, aren't we?

MARK BUTLER:                 Well I'm not sure I've ever heard Kevin Rudd call himself The  Terminator. We have said we're terminating the carbon tax, that  is the description given to the fixed-price arrangement by many  in the community, and most in the media, Peter and Paul. And to  be very clear, that arrangement under a Labor Government will  be terminated and we'll be moving more quickly than otherwise  would have been the case to an emissions trading scheme. A  scheme that for the first time, introduces an actual cap on the  amount of carbon pollution that can be dumped into the  atmosphere, and allows businesses to work out the proper price.

PETER VAN ONSELEN:    Don't you need to go to Parliament before the election to show  voters that you're fair dinkum about this? I mean recalling  Parliament, and trying to get this through the Senate, whether  you succeed or fail depending on what the Greens and the  Coalition did, wouldn't that be a real strong gesture that this is  more than just an election promise?

MARK BUTLER:                 Well that question's obviously very much tied up with the  question of election timing, and I'm not privy to that and Kevin  Rudd, as Prime Minister, has a range of issues he needs to  factor in that decision. But I've made it clear I think before, that I  see it as my responsibility to be ready to do either. Either to take  legislation to the Parliament in the event that Parliament does sit  again before the next election, or if not, then at least to have  very, very clear draft legislation out - which I hope will be out in  coming days or at the most the next couple of weeks - so that no  one could be under any ambiguity or any uncertainly about what  the Labor Party's commitment is around climate change.

We'll have draft legislation out, we already have costings out,

we'll be very clear what the impact to households and business  will be. And if - before or after the election - the Greens Party or  the Opposition for that matter, turn their back on emissions  trading again, for a second time, as they did in 2009, then I think  the people will judge them very, very harshly. This is a model

that has been accepted very broadly around the world,  overwhelmingly around the world as the right model to deal with  the threat of carbon pollution, and resulting climate change. And  I think the time has come for the Opposition to get off the political  posturing, for the Greens to get off their far-left political posturing  as well, and adopt the model that is increasingly being adopted  around the world.

PETER VAN ONSELEN:    I'm sure we'll get to some of those details about the model in a  moment. But you mention there about the Government being  very clear about the cost of pricing carbon and so on. There's a  bit of unclarity though isn't there, or a lack of clarity. Because  initially I recall for years during the life of this Parliament, your  side of politics saying that the Coalition is overstating the impact  on cost of living, they're overstating the impact of the carbon tax  on for example electricity prices. Yet part of your pitch for  bringing the floating price forward, is to fix cost of living problems  - indeed to fix the difficulties that people face in terms of their  power bills. That's inconsistent.

MARK BUTLER:                 Well fix is your language Peter, I don't think Kevin Rudd used  that language at all last week. He said that there would be a  modest but important impact on cost of living for households,  and also an impact on input costs for business, which ultimately  will flow onto households. This will be important relief, but the  modelling we put out there, the estimates - for example - on  electricity prices when the fixed carbon price, or the carbon tax  was introduced, was absolutely spot on in, I think, every  jurisdiction around the country.

Tony Abbott was talking about $100 roasts, and towns getting

wiped off the map. He was the one overstating, our modelling  was spot on. And what we're saying this week though, or said  last week, is that we'll be able to provide even more relief to  households, so that during what is a difficult time for everyone -  with ongoing uncertainty in the global economy - households,  businesses for that matter, will have just a little bit more relief  than we would otherwise have been able to deliver them in  2014-15.

PETER KELLY:                   Minister do you accept that the emissions trading scheme, which  is being adopted, is in fact Julia Gillard's scheme?

MARK BUTLER:                 Well, it's clear that the scheme introduced and passed,  essentially under the prime ministership of Julia Gillard, was  going to move to an emissions trading scheme in 2015-16. It has  been the policy of the Labor Party for years now, the 2007  election and 10 election, to have an emissions trading scheme -  a scheme that caps carbon pollution and allows business to work  out the cheapest possible way to work within that limit on carbon  pollution in our economy. So yes, Julia Gillard, all members of  the Labor caucus, have been committed to emissions trading.

PETER VAN ONSELEN:    [Interrupts] So Kevin Rudd is still selling Julia Gillard's scheme,  that's the bottom line. He's just brought forward the date of the  floating price.

MARK BUTLER:                 That's right. We've been able to terminate the fixed price, or the  carbon tax, what ever language you want to use, twelve months  earlier, so that we can move more quickly to the emissions  trading scheme, which has always been the ambition of all Labor  Party members since well before the 2007 election. We also  remember of course, last week is six years to the date that John  Howard announced that the Liberal Government then was  committed to introducing precisely the emissions trading scheme  model that we're moving to introduce in 2014-15. This is not an  unusual model to be used in response to this very significant  challenge.

PAUL KELLY:                      Now Minister, the Shadow Minister Greg Hunt argues that over  the next eight years the revenue raised through your carbon  pricing arrangements, as announced by Kevin Rudd, will be 58  billion as opposed to 64 before. Do you agree with those  numbers?

MARK BUTLER:                 Well no I don't. Look it's important to recognise what happened  with Treasury's modelling on this. Treasury, as is appropriate,  modelled a price in 2020 that would reflect, I guess, the  implementation of the international commitment - so not just here  in Australia but across the world - the international commitment  to keep carbon pollution to 450 parts per million, which ultimately  would mean that the increase in global temperatures would be  kept to below two degrees Celsius. And what Treasury has done  is essentially drawn a straight line from the floating price date,  which will now be 2014-15, up to that price in 2020.

Now over time of course, this is going to be a market where

business ultimately sets the price, and Treasury will have to  update its modelling, and it's forecast in the same way it does in  response to fluctuations in the currency market, or in the  commodities market. But that was entirely the appropriate thing  for Treasury to do, but being a market, over time Treasury will  have to review quite what the market is doing.

PETER VAN ONSELEN:    One of the issues though, isn't it, is that people look at the  projections by Treasury for where the floating price will move to,  versus the reality of where it's going start now that it's tied into  the European scheme. And they look at that and wonder how the  budget is going to be anything other than massively in the red, if  we are less likely to bring in the kind of revenue through the  floating price than Treasury has earmarked, given the amount of  compensation that's being handed back to voters at the same  time.

MARK BUTLER:                 But this is not unusual. We don't operate a command and control  economy. We operate a private economy, effectively, and  Government revenue is always subject to fluctuations in the  market as I've said, in response to fluctuations in the currency  market. And very significant fluctuations in commodity prices that  we've seen, hit revenues very hard. They hit them in a good way  in the mid part of the last decade, they're hitting them on the  downside, and have been for the last few years. So this is not  unusual. It makes Treasury's job very difficult, they're very  talented bunch, but over the next coming years they'll have to

monitor that market in the same way they monitor all other  markets.

PETER VAN ONSELEN:    But as uncertain as things like the iron ore price might be if we're  seeing a shift from $100 to $70 in percentage terms that's  nothing like what we're seeing with the carbon price moving from  around $24 a ton down to $6 a ton. I mean that's got to gut the  budget, doesn't it?

MARK BUTLER:                 Which is why we've had to make some pretty responsible but  difficult savings over the last week that we've announced. And I  guess that is the commitment ultimately particularly the  Treasurer and Minister Wong as Finance Minister, they do have  a difficult job in a time where revenue is being depressed  through the ongoing impact of the GFC and the issue we have  with nominal GDP growth being lower than real GDP growth. We  have a very strong commitment to fiscal responsibility and as  these different markets fluctuate including in the future the  carbon market, it is the job of the Expenditure Review  Committee to make sure that we cut our cloth accordingly.

PAUL KELLY:                      Minister, our 2020 reduction target is five per cent. Given the  ongoing warnings about the nature of the climate change  problem, to what extent would you like to look at a more  ambitious target?

MARK BUTLER:                 Well, in the time I've been the Climate Change Minister, a  number of environmental groups have talked to me about their  ambition for government to increase the target. As you'll  remember we have a range of targets that we've announced.  The five per cent minimum and then potentially higher targets  depending on progress in international negotiations. My  response to them and to the community more broadly is we put  in place I think a system that deals with this properly. It's a  system overseen by the Climate Change Authority chaired by  Bernie Fraser, the former Reserve Bank governor, and he is  doing a report along with the rest of his board and the authority  staff that will be looking at the 2020 reduction target of five per  cent as a minimum and also the caps year on year between  2014 and 2020 to ensure that we to that ultimate end point.

I think that's the appropriate thing to do, a draft report from

Bernie Fraser's board will be out I think in around October and  legislatively they're required to produce a final report by the end  of February to give us a very clear view about what that  minimum target should be. So my inclination is to let the Climate  Change Authority do its work. I know it's an authority that has a  high level of confidence in the environmental group sector and in  the business sector. I think instead of me stomping around and  nominating other figures, it's best to let the authority do its work  over the coming months.

PAUL KELLY:                      To what extent to you think the Australian public is still  concerned about climate change? A number of people would  argue the issue has gone off the boil. What's your view of that  and to what extent do you think climate change will be an issue  front and centre at the coming election?

MARK BUTLER:                 Well, look I think community views about climate change have  moderated to some degree since the middle part of the last  decade. I think the impact of the drought particularly in my part of  Australia and some other weather events were very much  accentuating the sense of immediacy around climate change but  also in a zero sum game way after the global financial crisis,  there was more of a focus on the immediate, I guess economic  health of the country and household security and suchlike. But  against all that I think there is still a very deep underlying  concern about climate change. I mean some of the research the  Climate Institute released last week for example shows that the  vast majority of people still think climate change is a reality and a  very worrying reality at that. And that human activity is a very  significant cause of that climate change.

They want their governments to act but I think it is true that the I

guess the smoke and the heat over the carbon tax debate over  the last couple of years has I think blunted the sense in the  community that government is serious about this. Not just our  government but Parliaments are serious about this. That's why I  think it's so important that we made the decision that we did last  week. We give the opportunity to the community to have a  confidence that we are going to move to the best possible model  as quickly as we can, the Emissions Trading Scheme. We are  going to have a cap on carbon pollution for the first time that  reduces over the years. And we are going to continue to have a  very, very strong commitment to renewable energy.

So that we can continue to see solar and wind-power and

suchlike grow into the future. And I think that will respond to the  very deep underlying sense the community has that they do  want serious action from their governments about what is going  to be a very enduring challenge for years and decades to come.

PAUL KELLY:                      What I'd like to ask you is do you believe that the Australian  public has got to make financial sacrifices in this cause? I mean  as Minister, is that your message or not? And the reason I ask  the question is because the degree of compensation provided for  these arrangements now is simply over the top. So what's your  view, what's your message about this point of financial sacrifice?

MARK BUTLER:                 Well, look, we make no apology, Paul, for the support that we've  particularly given to low and middle income households.  Households on fixed incomes like pensions to ensure that they  are protected during this transition in the economy. There does  have to be a very significant transition in the economy and  government is supporting that. For example, through supporting  small-scale renewable energy projects. People putting solar and  solar water heaters on their roof. Right up to the sort of support  that we need to give to very large-scale renewable energy  projects. I mean to that extent the broader community is making  a sacrifice through government making financial commitments  and giving financial support to that transition.

But we make no apology for ensuring particularly that low to

middle income households are protected during this transition  period. As we did in the 1980s when there was a very significant

transition in the economy under the Hawke and Keating  governments.

PETER VAN ONSELEN:    Minister, do you see how it looks like it doesn't make sense?  That if you're compensating people indeed overcompensating  people for increases in electricity prices attached to measures to  try to address climate change, then you're not changing their  habits necessarily because they've got the extra money in their  pocket to pay for the price rise. The whole point of an Emissions  Trading Scheme isn't it to deter people from being in a position  where they choose these high emissions intensive forms of  energy, why would they do that when they've got the money in  their pocket to pay for it?

MARK BUTLER:                 Well, because and this is the crucial element of an Emissions  Trading Scheme, you introduce a cap on carbon pollution so that  there is an effective limit on the amount of carbon pollution that  can be dumped into the atmosphere. That forces business to  start to find cleaner ways to operate. They start trading those  obligations through an Emissions Trading Scheme in permit so  that they can find the cheapest way to do it. But there is no  choice. Under a system that has a cap on carbon pollution, the  community simply must move to a cleaner way of operating. But  also I've seen a very strong willingness on the part of  households to do this.

When we came to government there were around 7000

households that had solar rooftop panels on their rooves. There  are now more than one million. People are willing to make this  change. They want to make a change for the better of the  environment into the future. But the really critical element is  putting this cap on carbon pollution. A cap or a legal limit on  carbon pollution that is the central element to the Emissions  Trading Scheme.

PETER VAN ONSELEN:    Mark Butler, we appreciate your time on Australian Agenda.
