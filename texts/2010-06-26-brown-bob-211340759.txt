"The Green vote "parked" with Australia's first female Prime Minister Julia Gillard, won't stay there long,"

Australian Greens Leader Bob Brown said today.



Commenting on the polls, Senator Brown said that the Gillard prime ministry will shed progressive voters

as the natural mood of celebration passes and the reality of Labor's right-wing ascendency manifests itself

in:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ A backdown to the mining billionaires over the $12 billion allocated from

the mining boom tax in the budget forward estimates.

"That will be a multibillion dollar loss other Australians will suffer", Senator Brown said.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ A continued harsh line on asylum seekers, as flagged in Ms Gillard's first

speech as Prime Minister.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Environmental failure: on whaling, biodiversity and marine reserves.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ A tough time for Greens negotiators wanting better funding for mental and

dental healthcare.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ More uranium mining and a Northern Territory nuclear waste dump.

"And I don't expect this Prime Minister to back the Greens' policy for a national integrity commissioner to

fight political corruption, or for our proposed commissioner for truth in political advertising.



"I do look forward to talking to Prime Minister Gillard about a carbon price and real action to tackle climate

change but I doubt that she will shake off the powerful coal mining lobby to achieve that goal," Senator

Brown said.
