E&OE

TONY ABBOTT:

Just on the government’s advertising campaign, this is a flagrant broken promise by  the Prime Minister. It’s a complete breach of faith with the Australian people. He said  before the last election that government advertising was nothing less than a cancer on  our democracy. He gave an absolute rolled gold commitment that he wouldn’t do it  other than under the strictest of conditions. He’s broken that, not because there’s a  national emergency, but because he’s now in a political emergency. The truth is that  you can’t believe anything that this Prime Minister says. He can give as many  doorstops outside churches as he wants but you still can’t trust anything he says.

QUESTION:

Why won’t the Coalition support the Greens to legislate an independent body to  review advertising?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, the issue here is that you cannot believe the Prime Minister, that’s the issue.  This is yet another Prime Ministerial broken promise, it’s yet another rolled gold rip  off by the Prime Minister.

QUESTION:

Would you put an end to government advertising?

TONY ABBOTT:

I want to put an end to a Prime Minister who just can’t be trusted.

QUESTION:

But what about government advertising?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, the issue is that you just can’t trust this Prime Minister. The most solemn  commitment from this Prime Minister is broken if he feels his political necessity

demands it. This is a Prime Minister who is completely driven by politics, not by  principle.

QUESTION:

But you’re the alternative Prime Minister, people have a right to know where you  stand on government advertising, would you ban it?

TONY ABBOTT:

The thing is that this is a Prime Minister who you just can’t trust to keep his word.

QUESTION:

What’s your opinion on government advertising, you’ve got to have an opinion?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think that what we want are governments and Prime Ministers who tell the truth and  this Prime Minister just has not told the truth.

QUESTION:

... you wanted to do everything to hold him to account, why not support an  independent body to review advertising?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I’m very happy to see the Senate inquiring into Senator Ludwig’s deception of  the Senate. I mean, the Government apparently has had this campaign in the pipeline  for some time. Senator Ludwig was before the Senate last week. If he’d had a skerrick  of honour he would have been upfront with his Senate colleagues about this  advertising campaign, but instead he hid it from them. So, I think it’s very important  that we see this inquiry into just why Senator Ludwig was so dishonest with his own  colleagues.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, what’s your message to the young LNP? They issued an invitation to  some of their members suggesting that Gough Whitlam’s birthday should be  celebrated because he’s old and near death.

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, it’s not something that I’m familiar with.

QUESTION:

They have form up there in Queensland, the LNP, with Facebook type pranks. What  do you think of this?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, I think I’d want to be familiar with the issue in question before I became  pontifical about it.

QUESTION:

On an alleged broken promise, Morris Iemma says that he actually had a commitment  from Kevin Rudd to help him privatise electricity, what’s your reaction to that?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well look, this is a Prime Minister who not only lies to the Australian public but he  lies to his own Labor mates. I mean the public can’t trust him, his Labor colleagues  can’t trust him, he doesn’t keep commitments to the public and he won’t even keep  commitments that he makes to Labor premiers.

QUESTION:

Is it appropriate for Coalition people to be joking about the near death of Gough  Whitlam?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, I just don’t want to comment on something that I haven’t seen and I just really  can’t comment in ignorance of what’s been done.

QUESTION:

On paid parental leave the Government’s released figures which show that your  scheme will push inflation up and inhibit growth, what’s your response to that?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think that there is real problem here with incomplete use of Treasury documentation  by the government. I hasten to add here that I am not being critical of the Treasury,  I’m being very critical of the government. The government regularly claims that  Treasury modelling shows something to its advantage but the modelling is never  released so that it can never be subject to proper scrutiny. Now, I just make the point  that it’s utterly implausible to think that a great big new tax on mining is going to  improve the economy when a modest and I hope temporary levy on just over 3,000  businesses won’t do so.

QUESTION:

What do you think about the Lowy poll that has found that voters have given a  scorecard of four out of 10 on the asylum seekers for government policies and five out  of 10 for climate change?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think this is a government which has really disappointed people and I think this poll  just reflects that. Thank you.
