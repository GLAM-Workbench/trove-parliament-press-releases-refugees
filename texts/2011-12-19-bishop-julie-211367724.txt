Subjects: Asylum seeker boat tragedy; death of Kim Jong Il

E&OE…

DAVID SPEERS    I want to go straight to the Shadow Foreign Minister Julie Bishop now, she is

joining us from Perth. Julie Bishop, thank you for your time I know you have been listening in there.

Can I just pick up before we get to Kim Jong Il’s death, just on this boat tragedy. I put it to Chris

Bowen and can I put it to you now, is it likely to break this deadlock or see any movement from the

two sides of politics in trying to set up an offshore processing regime?

JULIE BISHOP    Well David it is a tragic situation that is unfolding and given that it is about 12

months to the day since the last tragic boat event, as people try and make their way to Australia, it is

time for the government to acknowledge that its abandonment of offshore processing, and now having

an onshore processing policy, means that there are pull factors at play. The people smugglers have

been emboldened. It is time for the Prime Minister to swallow her pride and to reinstate the policies

that have been proven to work, and that is offshore processing on Nauru, temporary protection visas

and a policy of turning the boats back, working with the Indonesians, where it is safe to do so.

DAVID SPEERS    But is the Coalition prepared to at least come part of the way and look at a

combination of offshore processing that satisfies both sides here, Malaysia and Nauru?

JULIE BISHOP    David, there is one set of policies that have been proven to work and I do not

understand why the Prime Minister will not reinstate the policies that have been proven to work, and

that was offshore processing on Nauru which is a signatory to the UN Convention on Refugees,

temporary protection visas and a policy of turning back the boats. And I urge the Prime Minister to re-embrace those policies.

DAVID SPEERS    Let’s turn now to the death of Kim Jong Il. We heard the Foreign Minister Kevin

Rudd earlier point out there will be uncertainty and ambiguity about what happens next. How

concerned, or otherwise, are you about this situation now?

JULIE BISHOP    Well David the death of Kim Jong Il should provide North Korea with a rare

opportunity to become a more enlightened nation, to show more compassion to its 24 million citizens,

to embrace a more open system of government and to give greater freedom to its people. Few people

around the world will genuinely regret the passing of Kim Jong Il, who is one of the most notorious

dictators and has used the threat of nuclear weapons to remain in power and to terrorise neighbouring

countries.

There will inevitably be a period of instability as they transition to a new leader, hopefully a more

enlightened leader. But the designated successor Kim Jong Un is relatively unknown. He is a

relatively young man, so we understand, in his late 20s, he was educated in Switzerland at an

international school, but other than that there is very little known about him. Apparently there is only

one known photograph of him. So there is a lot of doubt about what will occur during this transition

period. We in Australia are of course committed to stability on the Korean Peninsula and just hope

that North Korea uses this historic opportunity to become a more responsible global citizen.

DAVID SPEERS    The six-party talks have essentially collapsed. China is seen as the only country

with real influence in North Korea, do you think Beijing has done enough to improve the situation in

North Korea and to deal with its nuclear weapons program, and what sort of message should be

delivered to China at the moment?

JULIE BISHOP    I don’t believe it has been easy for China because North Korea has been a very

irresponsible global citizen. It has reportedly developed and put in place nuclear weapons, it has

apparently tested nuclear weapons and long range missiles which have the capability of carrying such

weapons. We have had a number of incidents in recent times, including the attack on a South Korean

navy ship, that has caused great concern, it is deeply troubling.

I know that the United States will be wanting to re-engage with China and the other parties to the six-party talks and it is crucial that we seek to do it at this time. And I have no doubt that China will also

see the opportunity that the death of Kim Jong Il presents to try and bring North Korea back to the

negotiating table and try and engage with North Korea.

It is time for a new era. The 24 million citizens of North Korea have suffered long enough under Kim

Jong Il and his father before him. The Korean Peninsula has been unstable for long enough, and we

hope that this opportunity will be embraced by all of the relevant countries involved.

DAVID SPEERS    Is there - this point is sometimes made when we look at military interventions in

places like Libya and elsewhere - are there grounds given the extraordinary famine, the isolation, the

brutal nature of the dictatorship there, are there grounds for some form of military intervention in North

Korea? Also given the fact that it has been able to develop this nuclear weapons program.

JULIE BISHOP    Oh David that would be an extremely radical and dangerous step. What I believe

we need to do is take the opportunity to bring North Korea to the negotiating table. There will be this

period of transition and if the reports are correct Kim Jong Un, the designated successor, is not very

experienced. There was to be a managed transition in 2012 but the death of Kim Jong Il has meant

that managed transition cannot occur now. There are reports that one of his uncles, Kim Jong Un’s

uncles, will in fact be ruling behind the scenes as Kim Jon Un essentially learns on the job.

Now what that means in terms of the military and how they will respond is yet to be seen. But I think

what the world needs to do is send a message that we would be ready to work with North Korea to

help it engage with the rest of the world and become a more responsible global citizen. Now that must

mean abandoning its nuclear weapons program and the development of nuclear weapons, and it has

also been reported that North Korea has been proliferating nuclear technology to other countries,

other regimes, including Iran. We really must seize this historic opportunity and see what we can

achieve.

DAVID SPEERS    Well just on that, if it is exporting nuclear material to Iran surely there is a case for

tighter sanctions, patrolling to stop that happening?

JULIE BISHOP    You mentioned earlier that China has influence in this regard, I believe that to be

the case. Although I do point out that it is not easy for China, I don’t believe it is easy for any country,

to deal with such a mysterious and oppressive regime as North Korea. But we can only hope that

China will be able to use whatever influence it has to engage with North Korea so we can see a more

enlightened regime, as I said, to provide greater freedom to its people and to show them the

compassion that has been lacking over the last few decades.

DAVID SPEERS    What about the United States in all of this? We have only had a brief statement

from the White House that essentially the President is aware and the White House is monitoring the

situation. We’ve seen in the recent visit from President Obama a clear pivot from the United States, or

intention to pivot, more into the Asia Pacific region. Is that and should that be part of monitoring and

keeping some pressure on North Korea?

JULIE BISHOP    Without doubt the US engagement in the Asia Pacific is essential and I believe that

the US will seek to work with China to deal with North Korea at this time. It is a case of not just one

country having to be involved but the US and also China as well as Japan, South Korea will all have

to be involved in seeking to embrace North Korea.

It is an opportunity, as I have said a couple of times in this interview, it is an opportunity for the rest of

the world to seek to embrace North Korea if possible. If the successor Kim Jong Un is as

inexperienced as we understand him to be maybe this is the breakthrough that we have been looking

for.

Now I know Japan will be deeply troubled by any period of instability. Japan has a number of issues

with North Korea going back many, many decades and the most sensitive issue in Japan relating to

North Korea involves the abduction of some Japanese nationals many years ago and that has never

been resolved. In the case of South Korea they live in the shadow of North Korea’s repressive regime.

So both countries will be very concerned about the transition to a new leadership. That is why we

need the United States and China to work with them to see if we can start a new page in the history of

the Korean Peninsula.

DAVID SPEERS    It does sound like you are taking a glass half full approach here, as a new

opportunity as you call it, therefore what do you think of Australia’s role in this? Are we a big player,

can we have any influence in trying to get that engagement that you talk about?

JULIE BISHOP    Well we are allies with the United States, we are very close friends and trading

partners with China. Japan and South Korea are some of our closest and strongest allies in the region

so of course Australia can provide whatever support is needed. I know it sounds like a glass half full

but I think we need to take that attitude at this stage until we see differently.

I am not naÃÂ¯ve about it. There are some reports that Kim Jong Un is just like his father. If that is the

case then that does not bode well for changed circumstances on the Korean Peninsula. But let’s hope

that this does represent an opportunity for change, a changed regime, a changed attitude. And in the

case of the nuclear weapons program hopefully we will be able to work with China, the United States

and the other parties to the six-party talks to encourage North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons

program and not use nuclear weapons to terrorise its neighbours as it has certainly done in the past.

DAVID SPEERS    You heard Kevin Rudd’s comments a little earlier urging open communication

between all of these various players, that there not be any wrong signalling, diplomatic signalling,

between the counties. Has that been the appropriate response so far?

JULIE BISHOP    I think that is absolutely right. We must have open communication. It is a very

difficult period, we want to be able to seize the opportunity. If there are any positive outcomes that will

flow from this we wouldn’t want there to be any diplomatic missteps. So it is a very sensitive time and

I am sure the White House is working very hard behind the scenes to get it right. I have read the short

statement from the White House and no doubt the diplomatic channels are working overtime at this

point.

The funeral of Kim Jong Il is reportedly at the end of December so we will be watching very closely,

along with the rest of the world, to see how this transition to a new leadership plays out, and just hope

it will be a more enlightened leadership in North Korea. It is way beyond time for that to occur.

DAVID SPEERS    Shadow Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, appreciate your analysis and comments on

this. Thank you for joining us.

JULIE BISHOP    Thank you David.
