TRANSCRIPT OF THE HON JOHN HOWARD HP, LEADER OF THE  OPPOSITION, INTERVIEWED BY JOHN LAWS, RADIO 2UE, SYDNEY,  TUESDAY 23 AUGUST 1988.

Q .  Good morning.

JWH Good morning, John.

Q Can you explain how your policy is different from

that being followed by the Government?

JWH The goal is the same and that is to give yourself

the right to alter the flow of people from any part  of the world. That is what I have been condemned  for. That is what the Prime Minister has accused  me of dividing the nation over.  Now this morning

we find that the emperor has no clothes at all. His own Government, through its former Minister,  gave a direction to alter the flow of people from a  particular part of the world. In other words, to  get more Europeans and more from America. All the  backtracking and double-talk now won't alter the

fact that what the former Minister told his  consultant to do was to get more business migrants  - and why? In the words of Peter Cullen on "AM"  this morning, it is a fact that people operating  businesses in a western culture find that they can  establish businesses more quickly here.  Now that  may not always be the case with everybody. But

that kind of comment and that kind of justification  shows quite clearly what was in the mind of the  Minister and in the mind of the consultant when  that directive was given. What I resent most of

all, deeply, in this whole thing is the hypocrisy  of the Government.

Q Do you believe that the Prime Minister was aware of

the directive that came from Mick Young?

JWH Well I don't know whether he was or he wasn't. But

"  he is fixed with notice of it. He is the

Prime Minister and it was given by the Minister he  appointed. I understand from a newspaper story  this morning that there has been no withdrawal of

that directive. I am charging the Prime Minister  and I am charging the Government with monumental  hypocrisy. For the past three weeks I have been  accused of all the imaginable and unimaginable  .  moral crimes under the sun because I had the

Q

temerity to say on your program that we had to be  concerned as a nation about the pace of change and  that we had a right to alter the flow of people. I  wasn't arguing for an end to Asian migration.

N o , I know you weren't .

I was not doing it for a return of the White  Australia policy. I was arguing for the right of  the Australian Government to determine the mix. And here we have these hypocrites revealed as

having acted to do the same thing. There is no way  they can justify it as other than an exercise in  altering the mix of business migration.

Yes and to alter the mix of business migration the  instruction has been to increase the proportion of  Europeans and North Americans at the expense of

Asians - at the expense of Asians.

They may say otherwise, they will pretend  otherwise, but that is the practical consequence of  it. It can't be anything else. If you weren't  setting out to alter the mix, if you weren't

setting out to change the proportions, why would  you give the directive in the first place? If you  were perfectly happy, if you weren't trying to  alter the balance, if you weren't trying to  discriminate against one region of the world, why  would you even raise the question in the first

place? It was raised because the Government has  concern that the program was getting out of whack.  It was raised because the Government wanted to

alter the proportion. Now I am not criticising  them for that but I am damning them and criticising  them for having the temerity to take the moral high

ground in this issue, to accuse me of trying to  divide the country because I was honest enough to  say what they had thought and in this area acted  upon. They wanted to have it both ways. They  wanted the moral purity of saying that they were

following totally, in every sense of the word,  non-discriminatory policy but at the same time,  behind closed doors, they wanted to change it. Now that is, in my view, more morally reprehensible  than anything that has occurred over the past three  weeks. We have the spectacle of this

Prime Minister, over the past 48 hours, saying it  is a dreadful dark thing that I have done.  There  is nothing dark about what I have done. I have

been quite open about it. I have said that we must  take our immigration program in hand.  We must  reserve the right to alter the mix. We must have  the courage to say so. We should have the guts to

debate this issue. The Prime Minister dumps on me  and takes this morally unctuous attitude and he is  now revealed to be an emperor without any clothing  at all on this subject because his own hypocrisy is

3 .

revealed because his own Government has done the  very thing that I have been condemned for saying a  Government ought to have the right to do. It's  been found out. They look ridiculous and they  deserve to be condemned. -

It would appear that when you made the statements  to me on this radio program three weeks ago  yesterday that (inaudible) acted upon those  statements.  Now wouldn't you have thought that

somebody in Government would have said to them well  look you better go a bit gently here because some  months ago Mick Young initiated virtually the same  proposal that's been put by John Howard.  Why  didn't somebody tell him?

It may well be that he should have been told.  Perhaps that is the reason why Clyde Holding has  been dumped.  I don't know. But the Prime Minister  has to take responsibility for what goes on inside  his own Government. He is the Prime Minister.  We  have a system of Cabinet responsibility.  Particularly if you set out to attack your  political opponent on moral grounds and the

Prime Minister has waged a campaign of great moral  fervour.  He has talked about division. He has  talked about my darkness. He has appealed to, as  he calls it, the decent people in the Liberal Party  and all the time his own Government has been  condoning the very practice which they are

condemning in u s .  I am not condemning the right of  the present Government to alter the balance of the  program. I am not condemning that. That is what I  say any Government should have the right to do.

But why dump on me? Why accuse me of being  anti-Asian which I'm not? Why accuse me of trying  to divide the country? Why deliberately exaggerate  the impact of this debate on countries in

South East Asia? At least I have been honest and  open and I have been prepared to debate the issue. I have been prepared to cop the flak. But this

Prime Minister has taken this morally unctuous  attitude and all the time his own Minister has been  running the very policy that he condemns in me.

Did Clyde Holding deserve the sack?

I think he has been a poor Immigration Minister. The FitzGerald Report was a damning indictment, not  only of him, but of the two previous Immigration  Ministers, Young and West. I think they do need a

stronger Minister running that Department and  running the immigration program because it is a  sensitive issue and you need a hands-on approach to  immigration. It is too important and it is too  much part of the mainstream of our community. It

is not something on the periphery. This is the  point FitzGerald made; that immigration has been a

4.

JWH

poor relation of policy making over the years.  But  it is something that affects the character and the  future and the essence of our nation because it has  the capacity to permanently change it.

Do you think the demise of Clyde Holding indicates  that the Government hasn't yet come to grips with  the migration issue?

I think the demise of Clyde Holding demonstrates  that the Prime Minister has finally realised that  unless he gets a stronger Minister running this  show then public contempt for the immigration  policy of his Government will go on. I don't think

there is any doubt that he needs a stronger hand at  at the tiller of immigration policy because it has  got out of hand. FitzGerald - this is not Howard,

this is FitzGerald - found that there was  widespread community hostility to the immigration  program. What our policy released yesterday  endeavours to do is to point some new directions.  Not - I repeat and I have to say it again and again

in every interview - not anti-Asian directions, not  anti-refugee directions, but a direction that says  at the end of the day the national interest of this  country - and that has to include public acceptance  of immigration policy and social cohesion take  precedence over anything else and the Government  has got to have the right to alter the flow of  people from any part of the world. Now that was

recognised by Mick Young when he gave that  directive to Mr Cullen in December of last year. He recognised that. Now if it was alright for  Young to give that directive - and that wasn't  morally reprehensible - why isn't it alright for

Howard to be arguing the same thing? Why is it  that so many newspaper editorials and the  Prime Minister and so many people - and I address  these comments to some of the leaders of ethnic  organisations that have been so quick to condemn me

- will they be as quick to condemn the directive  that Young gave?

I doubt it.

Will they upbraid the Prime Minister?

I doubt it.

With statements saying he's been hypocritical? I  will wait. I will wait with baited breath.

I wouldn't hold your breath because I don't think  they will.

Well it will demonstrate that there is a double  standard in this debate.

Well there is no doubt that there is a double  standard in the debate.

I have said at the very beginning when I did that  interview with you, John, which in a sense -started  this thing off, that I chose my words carefully.  They weren't emotional.  They weren't prejudiced.

I haven't added to them. I haven't gone beyond  those words. I have taken care more than others  to not go beyond those words.  But I have not  retreated from them.

Do you think that this disclosure that indicates  that Mick Young took this same initiative in  December of last year, do you think it will lend  cohesion to the Liberal Party ranks because I read

in the paper this morning that the Liberals are so  divided over the amended immigration policy that  some are threatening to quit the Party? Do you get

that impression? You had a meeting yesterday with  them.

Nobody will leave the Parliamentary Liberal Party  over this issue.  I don't believe that for a  moment.

Have any members suggested to you privately that  they're unhappy with the path that you're following  in that area?

Some people disagree with it but there's nothing  unusual about that. The public has got to get used  to the situation that the Liberal Party, like the  Labor Party, has strong internal debates.  Majority  decisions are taken. The majority like those  decisions and some people don't. But that is the  nature of any democratic party and the  Liberal Party is no different from the Labor Party.

We're also being told it has upset important people  in certain Asian countries. This is what we're  being told. Are you aware of that?

I've been told that and I think that's been greatly  exaggerated. I wonder whether Mick Young's  directive to Peter Cullen will have the same  effect. I wonder whether the Prime Minister will  wring his hands about the impact of that directive

on people in South East Asia? I don't think  sensible people in South East Asia deny for a  moment the right of a country to make decisions on  its immigration policy free of interference. I

don't accept that any country has a right to  dictate to us how we will determine our migration  policy any more than I have got a right to say to  the Government of Malaysia or Singapore, "You

should have your migration policy according to  these principles". If I were advocating a stopping

of Asian immigration, if I were saying I wanted to  go back to the days of the White Australia policy,  there would be every justification. But I am not  saying that and I never will say that. I said that  on your program three weeks ago and I repeat it. I  will never argue for that. But what I will argue

for is that the pace of change has to be acceptable  to the community and we have to have the right to  alter the flow of people from any part of the world  if we believe the changed requirements suggest that  happen.  Now that is obviously what Young had in  mind in December of last year. (inaudible)

consistent with any other proposition.

Yes. They were very hush-hush on the subject  though, weren't they?

And they weren't up-front. They have belted me and  abused me and vilified me over the last three weeks  because I said that a Government ought to have the  right to do what they did.

Okay. Could I then summarise, not only what you've  said this morning but what you said to me  originally on that first fateful day that triggered  it all, that you still believe that we should have  a collection of people from all parts of the world.

Yes, absolutely correct.

You believe that if we can get people from all  parts of the world to make a contribution to this  country, so much the better?

Y es.

You also believe that when they come to this  country that they should look to Australia as their  country? But you don't see it necessary that they  lose sight of their own heritage?

Part of the Australian tradition is to acknowledge  that people who weren't born in this country want  to preserve an affinity with an affection for their  own heritage.

Yes, and you subscribe to that?

Utterly. There was one mischievous suggestion that  I only wanted people to speak foreign languages in  their own home. That's nonsense. They can speak  it anywhere they like. If I had beern born in  Greece I would want to be able to continue to speak  Greek anywhere I like. That's not an issue. That's not in question. I don't deny that  diversity for a moment.

So you're really not opposed to multiculturalism?

-  r

JWH I am opposed to the excesses of multiculturalism.

Q Yes but you're not opposed to multiculturalism to

the extent that the Greek community, if it feels it  should, should celebrate its Greek national day?

JWH No I'm not.  I go to them regularly. I love them,

(inaudible)

Q Well I would have thought that most would have. So

in essence you think that people should be able to  come to Australia from all parts of the world. If  they can make a greater contribution to the  country, so much the better. If they're prepared

(inaudible) citizenship and look to Australia as  their country while still maintaining their own  heritage, you see no problems with any of that?

JWH I don't see any problems. The uniting bond between

all of us, whether you were born in Australia like  you and me or born overseas wherever it is, there  has got to be some shared Australian values.  One  Australia is emphasising that all of us, whether  Australian born or in Vietnam five years or Italy

40 years ago, that we all have the same commitment  as Australians and we all have the same  responsibilities. But within that of course you  can maintain and cherish your own special heritage.

I have never denied that.

Q Okay John. Thank you for your time. It will be

interesting to see how other sections of the media  handle the fact that Mick Young has initiated some  months ago the moves that you suggested to me some  weeks ago and have been pilloried for doing so.

JWH I'll be fascinated.

Q Okay. I'll talk to you soon.

JWH Thanks John.
