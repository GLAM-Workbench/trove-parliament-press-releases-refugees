Labor Adds to Cost of Processing Unlawfuls MPS 016/2001

The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock, today said that Labor's position on the planned Administrative Review Tribunal would ensure higher processing costs for unlawful arrivals.

"Labor is again being obstructionist and has decided to oppose the reforms that will bring about the ART," Mr Ruddock said.

"This means that a more expensive multi-tribunal system will need to be maintained, even though Labor supports the principle that the existing Refugee Review Tribunal and Migration Review Tribunal should be amalgamated into the new body.

"The Opposition has criticised the Government over the costs of detaining and processing illegal arrivals, yet when solutions are offered, they make themselves part of the problem.

"It costs around $300-million a year to detain and process unlawful arrivals and the Government is determined to reduce the cost to the taxpayer.

"The stand on the ART, together with a lack of cooperation on judicial reform brings into question the Labor Party's commitment to improving the efficiency of the refugee and immigration determination system," Mr Ruddock said.
