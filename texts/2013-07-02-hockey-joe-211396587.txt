THE HON JOE HOCKEY MP

SHADOW TREASURER

RADIO 2GB - ROSS GREENWOOD   MONDAY, 1 JULY 2013



E&OE…………………………………………………………………………………

PRESENTER:

Let’s go now to the Shadow Treasurer Joe Hockey who is on the line right now. Many thanks  for your time. Look, here is the interesting thing about this. Now we are being told by Kevin  Rudd that if your Party were elected into Government that Australia would fall into recession.  As I pointed out, I fail to see the real connection because it wouldn’t matter what political  party right now is elected it’s certainly going to be a situation that the policies already in  place are going to be, if you like, detrimental to the future economic consequences of  Australia.

JOE HOCKEY:

It was a foolish comment. There are two Kevin Rudds. There is fake Kevin Rudd and then  there is real Kevin Rudd. Fake Kevin Rudd is one that says he is an economic conservative  and yet he runs the biggest deficits and the biggest debt in modern Australian history. The  fake Kevin Rudd says he is going to take a meat axe to the Public Service. The real Kevin  Rudd is the one that increases the Public Service by 20,000. The fake Kevin Rudd is the one  that says Tony Abbott cannot deal with Indonesia. The real Kevin one is the one that actually  did massively destabilise our relationship with Indonesia over the Oceanic Viking and a  range of other things. The list goes on.

PRESENTER:

On that subject, let’s go to one other comment that was made today by Kevin Rudd. Just have  a listen to this.

KEVIN RUDD:

I am very concerned about whether if Mr Abbott were to become Prime Minister and  continues that rhetoric and that posture and actually tries to translate it into reality I  really wonder if he is trying to risk some sort of conflict with Indonesia.

PRESENTER:

Now he’s talking about asylum seekers coming to Australia and the policy that the Coalition  has of turning back boats to try and dissuade people smugglers from sending people to our  country. What Kevin Rudd is saying there is that he believes if we do that we could create a  conflict with Indonesia. This seems again inflammatory?

JOE HOCKEY:

It is a silly statement. Again, this is fake Kevin Rudd who makes up things about Tony  Abbott - makes up things about the Coalition. The real Kevin Rudd is obviously the one that  has created the instability by making those stupid comments. This is a hopeless Government  led by someone who is a fake. Let’s call it as it is - they have had 70 front benchers in six  years under Labor. There are only 102 people in their entire Parliamentary room, and they  have had 70 of them - front benchers - in six years. They have had three reshuffles this year.  They have had five Assistant Treasurers in six years, six Small Business Ministers in three  years, four Immigration Ministers in six years, six Ministers for Housing, six Ministers for  Centrelink, four Trade Ministers and they have nine different Education Ministers in six  years. No wonder the business community is concerned about what is going to happen over  the next few months; let alone if they are re-elected and you have another three years of this  incompetent Government. Seriously, how could you ever have stability when you have had  70 front benchers - 70 people as ministers and parliamentary secretaries - in just six years.

PRESENTER:

I will take you to another one. Have a listen to this - the Prime Minister - talking about the  Government’s relationship with business.

KEVIN RUDD:

Business is a group that this Government will work with very closely. What I want to  see here in Canberra is for business and Labor to work together. I don’t want to see  things which drive business and Labor apart. We have been natural partners in the  past - we can be again in the future.

PRESENTER:

So there is Kevin Rudd talking last Wednesday night, as you are aware, with that particular  commentary about business. Now you are saying it is completely the opposite to what he is  trying to achieve?

JOE HOCKEY:

That is fake Kevin saying he wants to work closely with business because the next day he  went and passed changes through the Parliament - rammed them through the Senate - to  change 457 visas which is disaster for business when it comes to diversifying their  workforce. Importantly it is going to put a lot of pressure on businesses with red tape. The  business community has spoken about it - the Business Council of Australia, the Australian

Chamber of Commerce and Industry - they have all spoken out against these changes to  457s. But nothing changed. It was Julia Gillard’s legislation - Kevin Rudd rammed it through  the Senate on Thursday after saying he wanted a closer relationship with business.

PRESENTER:

As the Shadow Treasurer, are you, right now, concerned about the state of the Australian  economy? Growth is slowing. It would seem as though the Reserve Bank may have to cut  interest rates again. The Australian dollar is falling not because the economy is perceived to  be healthy by international investors. Really, it would seem there is genuine concern that the  economy may have gone off track.

JOE HOCKEY:

Of course. I have been very upfront about it. As I said two weeks ago in an address we, the  Coalition, will not let the Australian economy slip into a recession. As you know, Goldman  Sachs and Merrill Lynch have warned that there is a percentage risk - a minority percentage  appropriately - but a percentage risk that Australia next year could slip into a recession.  Nouriel Roubini has warned - in one of his private advices and, as you know, he is one of the  foremost economists in the world - that confidence in Australia had collapsed when the  Government failed to deliver a much promised surplus. Now you have political instability  and incompetence in Canberra. Why on earth would you as a business person go out and take  a significant business risk at this very moment when you have such massive instability and  incompetence coming from the Labor Government?

PRESENTER:

You say that you will not allow the economy to slip into recession but the Reserve Bank has  only got limited firepower left to be able to try and stimulate the economy. Do you therefore  say that the other option clearly is that the Government allows the deficits to grow, the debt to  increase to try and make certain the Australian economy does not slip into recession - that  there is enough cash, that there is enough stimulus out there to regain confidence?

JOE HOCKEY:

As you know, there are a number of economic stabilisers such as the Australian dollar which  can take some of the shock. Of course the Reserve Bank does have some capacity to move  but obviously of concern is that is increasing limited. Having said all of that the Coalition is  one that drives economic growth in Australia. Business gives us economic growth but the  Coalition has always put in place the drivers of economic growth - made it easier for  business to get on with the job of creating jobs and giving people hope that tomorrow will be  better than today.

PRESENTER:

Though you are now not the Treasurer - Shadow Treasurer you are - but you make the  observation that the Reserve Bank has limited firepower. Given if interest rates are cut we

don’t get the response from housing and business and the retail market, do think Australia can  discount - or you as the Treasurer - can discount the prospect of quantitative easing - the  effective printing of money in the future?

JOE HOCKEY:

I don’t think it is going to get to that at all. I certainly would not allow the situation to  develop where there was such a massive deterioration - and if it were in the reasonable  control of the Government - all factors being in reasonable control of the Government. For  example, you get rid of the carbon tax - that will have a positive impact on the economy, I  have no doubt about that. It will immediately act as a stimulus for the economy. It will lower  energy costs. One of great causes of angst, particularly for manufacturers in Australia, is the  cost of carbon. Here you have a Government that is going to play around with emissions  trading scheme which is more complicated than actually abolishing the carbon tax. But this is  what Kevin Rudd is about to promise at a cost to the Budget of billions of dollars. We are  saying no. The damn tax is going - that’s it. The mining tax is going to go.

PRESENTER:

But you have still got to manage the billions of dollars - whether you bring it down to a  market based scheme or whether you eliminate it all together. There are still billions of  dollars that have to be found.

JOE HOCKEY:

We said we are going to have cuts in some expenditure. We cannot afford to keep borrowing  money to pay out roughly a billion dollars a year on a Schoolkids Bonus. We have said that.  We have said that we will not keep 20,000 extra public servants in Canberra which is what  Mr Rudd has created. We said 12,000 will go in the first two years. We are going to cut our  cloth and get rid of waste and manage more carefully. Tony Abbott has had the courage to be  upfront about some of the savings that need to be made to pay for these things but when you  get rid of the mining tax and when you get rid of the carbon tax I am telling you, it is going to  stimulate business. One of the biggest miners in Australia came into my office - the CEO -  and said he is paying a $180 million a year in carbon tax and he is closing mining operations  in Australia at the moment. I said “Will getting rid of that carbon each have a difference?”  and he said “Sure it will… Maybe it keeps my pits open for a bit longer whilst we are going  through this period of oversupply in the global coal market”. Now this is the sort of thing I  keep hearing and we have got to do something about it. The problem is Labor is not doing  something about it because they don’t engage with business. They don’t listen to business -  big and small - all they do is just more regulation, more green tape and more taxes.

PRESENTER:

Joe Hockey, Shadow Treasurer, always good to talk to you.
