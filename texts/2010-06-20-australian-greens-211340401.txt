Senator Sarah Hanson-Young, Greens Spokesperson on Immigration and Human Rights:



"As we celebrate World Refugee Day today, it's important that the Federal Government acknowledges the

real effect of its asylum-seeker policies.



"We need to see an end to using vulnerable asylum-seekers as political footballs.



"The first thing the Government has to do to redeem itself is to lift its suspension of processing claims from

Sri Lankans and Afghanis.



"We know the damage that can be done to people's mental health when they are detained for prolonged

periods.



"If the suspension is not lifted, then we are going to see more men, women and children suffering harm

through their detention.



"The Government needs to stop trying to project a false image of toughness on asylum-seekers, and

remove policies that discriminate against people fleeing persecution because of their country of origin or

their mode of arrival in Australia.''
