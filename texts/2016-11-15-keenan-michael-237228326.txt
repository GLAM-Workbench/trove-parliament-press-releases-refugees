E&EO…………………………………………………………………………………………..

PETER DUTTON:

I’m very pleased to be here with Michael Keenan. I want to say thank you very much  to the staff that have showed us through the National Monitoring Centre here. It is  incredibly important work in keeping our borders safe and keeping our ports safe and  on a daily basis the officers here are working in with the AFP, and with other  authorities around the country and with their ABF contacts in a way that Australians  won’t see each day, but they should be reassured in the knowledge that this work is  being done in an effort to detect crime and to keep Australians safe.

I want to say thank you very much to Commander James Watson who is the  Regional Commander here in Victoria and Tasmania and also to the AFP  representative here John Beveridge and Mr Keenan can talk more about the work of  the AFP shortly.

I wanted to say a couple of words this morning about Mr Shorten and the Labor  Party’s approach to what we have got on the table in the Parliament at the moment.  The legislation that was introduced and passed in the Lower House is absolutely  crucial in our continuing message to people smugglers.

Don't forget - and no Australian should believe that people smugglers have not gone  away, this problem is with us and will be with us for a long period of time to come - Mr Shorten is out there trying to throw around these red herrings that somehow this  is going to be a problem in 30 or 40 years when people want to come to Australia  and apply for a tourist visa.

The reality is that this Government is dealing with the threat to our country over the  next three or four days, over the next three or four weeks, over the next three or four  months.

This problem of people smugglers is with us, it is tangible. We know that we have  14,000 people in Indonesia waiting to get on to boats now and we need to have this  legislation in place so that we can stare down threat from the people smugglers.

Mr Shorten is out there now today talking about 457 visas. This is another  distraction. It's another distraction away from the fact that the Labor Party remains  bitterly divided over border protection policy.

This Government has struck a deal with the United States to get people off Manus  and Nauru. Labor put these people on Manus and Nauru. We are getting them off.  We are doing it in a way that means that we can stare down the threat of new boat  arrivals, but if we have divided messages coming from Australian political leaders,  the people smugglers will trade on those messages.

Mr Shorten is out there trying to create distractions at the moment, but he needs to  answer the core question. He talks a big game, he says that he is on a unity ticket  with the Government and then votes against us. He says that he's for shaving off the  numbers of 457 visa applicants, but when he was a Minister in a Labor Government,  the number of 457 visas increased. So don't believe what Mr Shorten says, look at  what he does.

He has turned out to be a weaker leader than even Julia Gillard and Kevin Rudd  when it comes to our response of staring down people smugglers. It is now time for  Mr Shorten to deal with the Left of his Party, to show the leadership that he promised  at the last election and deal with this issue - stare down the Left of the Labor Party  and support this legislation through the Senate. If he does that then that will send a  strong message of  deterrence to people smugglers who will seek to misrepresent  the deal with the United States, our efforts to clean up Labor's mess, because we  don't want to see new arrivals filling the vacancies in the regional processing centres  on Nauru and Manus. We have been able to close down 17 detention centres on the  mainland and get 2,000 children out of detention that Labor put into detention.

We want to continue to work together with the agencies, including very importantly  the Australian Federal Police, and I will ask Minister Keenan to say some words and  then we're happy to take some questions.

MICHAEL KEENAN:

Thanks Peter. It's good to be here at the National Monitoring Centre of the Australian  Border Force with you. I'm pleased to be joined by Commander Watson from the  ABF and Commander John Beveridge, the AFP's State Manager for Victoria.

You can see behind us the sorts of sophisticated technologies that we use to secure  our ports and airports. When we came to Government we found both Customs at the

time and our other law enforcement community had not been supported by the  previous Labor administrations. They didn't have the capability to do what they  needed to do to keep the Australian people safe.

We reinvested in Australian Border Force, we reinvested in the Australian Federal  Police, we created the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission - an agency that  had not been supported by the previous administration - to make sure that we are  doing everything we can to tackle the organised criminal groups that particularly try  and peddle in the misery of drugs.

The Australian Federal Police works very closely with the Australian Border Force,  both in keeping our ports and our airports secure, but also in Operation Sovereign  Borders - it's one of the 16 agencies responsible for destroying the people  smuggling trade. That cooperation continues to be alive in the wake of the  resettlement deal that we have made with the United States and like other agencies,  the Australian Federal Police will be ensuring that they have resources on hand to  deal with anyone in the people smuggling trade that thinks that they can test our  resolve. If they do test our resolve, they will lose. We are determined to eradicate the  people smuggling trade and our record on this shows that we will continue to do  exactly that.

Now it’s up to the Labor Party about whether they are going to support these efforts.  It is clear that over the six years in government that every decision they made, every  judgement they made on people smuggling was wrong. They should listen to the  Government that got everything right when we came to office and eradicated the  people smuggling trade when they said it was impossible for us to do that.

The Australian Federal Police will continue to work very closely as part of Operation  Sovereign Borders and will continue to work very closely with Australian Border  Force to keep our ports and airports safe and I'd like to congratulate Minister Dutton  for the work that he's doing in ensuring that people smugglers never get another leg  up to game the system by bringing people illegally to our country.

PETER DUTTON:

Ok. Are there any questions?

JOURNALIST:

Minister Dutton you spoke a lot about Bill Shorten, but you've got four crossbenchers  in the Senate who are unsure whether they're going to support this legislation. Are  you concerned they will block it?

PETER DUTTON:

This is an issue for Mr Shorten. Mr Shorten has the balance of power in the Senate  and if he decides to support the Government that is important not only in the sense  of getting the legislation through, but more importantly for the people smugglers to

hear a united message from the Australian political leaders. Both the Prime Minister  and the alternative prime minister of this country must send a strong and coherent  message to people smugglers and at the moment it is only Malcolm Turnbull that's  meeting that test.

Unfortunately Mr Shorten has failed that test; not for any other principle than the fact  that he has got 26 people in his own Party who spoke out against this legislation  even before Mr Shorten was able to open his own mouth. It shows that the Labor  Party is desperately divided still on border protection policy. They have the ability to  show leadership now and they need to do it.

When the Senate reconvenes next week and the week after - there are only two  sitting weeks left this year - the Labor Party needs to deal with this legislation, to  pass the legislation so that we can stare down the threat of people smugglers who  will be using the US resettlement deal as propaganda to try and get people back  onto boats.

JOURNALIST:

It looks like Bill Shorten is not going to support this. Nick Xenophon says he will  support it if there is an additional increase in Australia's humanitarian intake. Are you  going to consider that?

PETER DUTTON:

I want Mr Shorten to support this legislation so that we can get it through the Senate.  That's the important test here. Mr Shorten is out there throwing around all sorts of  red herrings and distractions, but Mr Shorten needs to explain today when he stands  up and addresses the media conference in Queensland, he needs to explain to the  Australian people why he went to the last election saying that he was on a unity  ticket with the Government and yet his actions demonstrate the complete opposite.

I mean why does Mr Shorten, when it comes to the 457 issue, always pretend to be  a friend of the workers when really he is only a friend of union bosses?

JOURNALIST:

So you’re not going to negotiate with the crossbenches?

PETER DUTTON:

We shouldn't be in a position to have to negotiate with the crossbenches because  Labor has the ability to pass this legislation.

What we need for the people smugglers to hear - as we have seen reports out of  Indonesia this morning with the Police Commissioner in Jakarta who has said that he  is concerned about reestablishment of the people smuggling trade - if the people  smugglers hear messages of weakness from the alternative prime minister in this

country, then that is manna from heaven for them. They are rubbing their hands  together with Bill Shorten’s indecision. I mean this is obvious. This is what's  happened over the course of the six years of Labor Government.

The people smugglers are sophisticated criminal organised crime syndicates. They  watch every word that I say, that the Prime Minister says, that Mr Shorten says, that  leaders in this country - including Premiers - have to say on this issue and they use  that to manipulate the message that they are giving to people to pay money to get on  to boats.

Now 1,200 people drowned at sea when Labor was last in power and 50,000 people  came on 800 boats. The Labor Party apologised for that massive failing of public  policy - probably the most significant failure of public policy in our country's history -  and yet Mr Shorten wants to repeat the mistakes of Ms Gillard and Mr Rudd. It  seems to me that Labor has not learnt their lesson when it comes to border  protection policy.

This Government has put in place measures which have stopped drownings at sea,  we’ve got 2,000 children out of detention, we have closed 17 detention centres and  the test now is for Mr Shorten to stand up on the side of the Australian people; not  cower to the 26 people on his own backbench on the Left of the Party that are  beating him into submission, because it seems to me that Anthony Albanese, the  leader-in-waiting in the Labor Party, is getting his way at the moment over Bill  Shorten and Mr Shorten needs to step up and show the leadership that's required to  send a very strong message that Malcolm Turnbull has sent to the people smugglers  in Indonesia and elsewhere.

JOURNALIST:

Will there be exemptions for people fleeing conflicts in Australia's direct  neighbourhood?

PETER DUTTON:

Our policy has been very clear: that is that the US deal that we have announced will  not apply under any circumstance to new arrivals. I don't care where people are  coming from, I don't care what their circumstance is, they will not be settling in this  country. The policy that we have announced doesn't apply to people under the age  of 18 if they have arrived at a regional processing country after July 2013.

We have been very clear about the Ministerial Intervention powers that will be within  in Bill which will allow the Minister of the day to look at particular cases, particularly  for example, where families may have been separated. We can look at a sensible  way at each of these measures. But for Mr Shorten to be out there saying that he is  blocking this because he is worried about people coming here on tourist visas in 40  years, demonstrates that he doesn't have the capacity to deal with the issue today.

JOURNALIST:

So people fleeing conflicts, say a hypothetical conflict in Fiji, Indonesia; David  Leyonhjelm has raised concerns about that, will you make exemptions for those  people if there is a hypothetical conflict in the future?

PETER DUTTON:

I am not going to deal in hypotheticals.

JOURNALIST:

Minister Keenan, may I ask you a question regarding the police operation off the  NSW coast targeting a drug vessel? Are you able to give us an update on that?

MICHAEL KEENAN:

Look, I can't because it is an ongoing operation.

JOURNALIST:

Are you happy to tell us if there have been any arrests?

MICHAEL KEENAN:

Look, again, it’s an ongoing operation so we will be able to make comment about  that when the operational phase has concluded.

PETER DUTTON:

Thank you very much.
