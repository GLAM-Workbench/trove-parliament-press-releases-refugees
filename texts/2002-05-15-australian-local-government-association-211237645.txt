Press Release on 2002-03 Federal Budget by Cr John Ross



LOCAL GOVERNMENT SHOCKED AND APPALLED

BY $100 MILLION CUT TO LOCAL ROAD FUNDING



The  Australian  Local  Government  Association  has  expressed  shock  and  disbelief  at  the   Howard Government’s decision to cut $100 million from the Roads to Recovery program in  2002-2003.



“This decision simply beggars belief,” said ALGA National President, Cr John Ross.  “Local  Government’s confidence in the Commonwealt h’s commitment to building and maintaining  Australia’s road infrastructure has now been shaken to the core.



“Over  the  past  year,  the  Commonwealth  has  pressured  Local  Government  to  fully  expend   funding from the $1.2 billion Roads to Recovery program on local roads.  This has resulted in  substantial  forward  commitments,  involving  contracts  for  hundreds  of  major  road  construction projects.  Now, without warning, the Treasurer has slashed a third of the $300  million  previously  promised  for  2002-2003.   Given  the  lead  times  involved  in  major  roadwork  projects,  many  local  councils  will  now  be  potentially  unable  to  meet  their  contractual obligations.



“The Commonwealth has literally pulled the rug from under hundreds of shires and councils  across the country.



“Apparently,  no  thought  has  been  given  to  the  consequences  for  local  communities,  now   forced  to  cover  a  $100m  financial  shortfall  in  order  to  meet  their  road  construction  commitments  or  pay  unknown  but  potentially  huge  penalties  for  breaking  contracts  with   construction companies.



“Local  Government  demands  immediate  action  from  the  Commonwealth  to  ensure  no  local   authority will suffer financial hardship as a result of this cavalier decision.



“Communities from every federal electorate in the country have been grossly misled by the  Howard  Government.   The  impact  of  this  decision,  which  severely  handicaps  Local  Government, can be mitigated if the government moves to ensure the program is rolled over  for a further four years at the conclusion of the current funding period,” Cr Ross said.

Executive Summary

Last  night  14  May  2002,  the  Federal  Treasurer  Hon.  Peter  Costello  brought  down  his  7th  Federal Budget. The budget has been formulated during a period of major global change in  the post 11 September and in a post election environment.  The budget is projected to go into  surplus in financial year 2002-2003 in order of the $2.1 billion.  .

In addition to the Federal Budget the Government also released its Intergenerational Report.  The  report  demonstrates  that  demands  on  health  and  ageing  services  will  increase  as  the   population  ages,  the  resulting  impact  being  that  it  will  place  significant  pressures  on  government spending as the number of people in the workforce decreases.

Although the ageing of Australia's populatio n is not expected to have a major impact on the  Federal Budget for another 15 years, there is a focus on planning to meet the emerging policy  challenges in a timely and effective manner to maintain sustainable government finances and  ensure  the  wellbeing  of  future  generations  of  Australia.   Major  long-term  policy  priorities   identified in the Report include developing an affordable and effective residential aged care  system  that  can  accommodate  the  expected  high  growth  of  eligible  persons;  preserving  a   well-targeted  social  safety  net  that  encourages  working-age  people  to  find  jobs  and  remain   employed; and encouraging mature age participation in the labour force.  These are issues we  encourage  councils  around  Australia  to  consider.  Copies  are  available  at  http://www.budget.gov.au/2002-03/highlights_index.html

Finally, the Federal Government also released the Fuel Taxation Inquiry Report.

Attached  is  a  summary  analysis  for  the  Federal  Budget  prepared  from  a  Local  Government   Perspective

Economic Forecasts



Treasury expects that good economic conditions will continue in Australia over the next year,  although there are some risks.  Growth forecasts were revised upward during 2001/02 as the  Australian  economy  performed  well  during  a  difficult  global  economic  and  political  environment.

The economy is forecast to grow by 3.75% during 2002/03 and unemployment is forecast to  decline  to  6%  by  June  2003.   Business  investment  is  growing  strongly  and  consumer  expenditure remains sound.  Good growth prospects are likely to lead in a deterioration of the  current account deficit, due to a rapid increase in imports and a rising Australian dollar on the  back of a sluggish US economy.

Inflation  remains  a  concern  and  increasing  interest  rates  are  expected  over  the  next  year  to   keep  inflation  in  check.   Inflation  is  forecast  to  increase  by  2.75%.   Risks  include  the   possibility of higher petrol prices and higher insurance premiums.

Major Measures



The major measures in the budget are:



Australian Local Government Association

The  government  has  allocated  $180  million  over  four  years,  with  $45  million  allocated  in   2002-03.



An additional $137  million has been allocated to Roads of National Importance but offset  by reduced payments to the States.

Environment protection

Budget Aggregates

Operating Statement (Revenue, Expenses and Budget Balance)  The fiscal position of the Commonwealth Government has improved since the 2001-02 Mid  Year  and  Economic  Fiscal  Outlook  (MYEFO).   Higher  forecast  economic  growth  has  resulted  in  upward  revisions  to  estimate  taxation  revenue  over  the  next  four  years.   The   Federal Budget estimates that:

Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½revenue  in 2002-03 will be $169.6 billion rising to $199.3 billion in 2005-06 an increase  of 17.5 % over the period;

Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½expenses in 2002-03 will be $170.2 billion rising to $192.0 billion in 2005-06 an increase  of 12.8% over the period; and

Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½an underlying cash balance in 2002-03 of $2.1 billion rising to $7.1 billion in 2005-06 an  increase of 338 % over the period.

Net operating balance -3,595 -545 1,977 4,500 7,306



An  underlying  cash  deficit  of  $1.2  billion  is  now  forecast  in  2001-02,  compared  with  an   estimated surplus of $0.5 million at Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook.  The deficit is  explained in terms of priority defence expenditure in Afghanistan and upgraded security and  border  protection  measures.   Other  factors  include  lower  tax  receipts  early  in  2002,  strong   uptake  of  the  First  Home  Owners  Scheme,  increased  Family  Tax  Benefit  and  Child  Care   Benefit,  increased  estimates  of  the  Diesel  Fuel  Rebate  Scheme  and  reductions  in  unemployment payments.

Economic Forecasts



The Federal Government forecasts that GDP will grow by 2.75% in 2002-03, higher than the  largest OECD countries.  High growth is driven by strong domestic demand, and high levels  of  business  investment  and  consumer  expenditure.   Construction  activity  is  expected  to   moderate with the cessation of the First Home Owners Scheme and net exports will decline  due to the rapid increase in imports to fuel growth.



In summary:

Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Economic  growth  in  Australia  for  2002-2003 is expected to be sustained at a reasonable  growth rate of 3.75%.

Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Employment  growth  is  picking up and the unemployment rate forecast to decline to 6%  by the end of the financial year.

Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Inflation is forecast to be around 2.75%, easing to 2.5% by the end of the financial year,  within  the  Reserve  bank’s  medium  term  inflation  target  band.  Recent  increases  in  oil   prices,  if  sustained,  could  impact  inflationary  outcomes.   Other  short  term  pressures  on   inflation include higher insurance premiums.

Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Labour  costs  are  expected  to  grow  at  a  moderate  pace  (4.25%)  due  to  moderate  wage   increases and high productivity growth.

Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½World growth is expected to be around 2.75% in 2002, although Australia’s major trading  partner  growth  is  expected  to  be  slower,  mainly  due  to  continued  weakness  of  the   Japanese economy.



Major Expense Decisions

The  Commonwealth  has  taken  a  number  of  policy  decisions  since  the  2002-03 MYEFO.   Government  expenditure  as  a  %  of  GDP  is  forecast  to  decline.   Major  new  budget  expenditure commitments include:

Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Upgrading domestic security costing $265 million in 2002-03.

Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Additional  funding  for  processing  unauthorised  boat  arrivals  and  border  protection,  totalling $238 million in 2002-03.

Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Net additional Defence funding of $194 million to support Australia’s participation in the  war on terrorism in Afghanistan and the Persian Gulf.

Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Improved administration of the tax system

Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Increased funding of $105 million to improve accommodation support, respite care, day  services and other disability services.

Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Family assistance including the introduction of the Baby Bonus, providing benefits of $85  million in 2002-03, increasing to $510 million in 2005-06.



Offsetting these increases includes:

Australian Local Government Association

Page 11 of 23



Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Decreased  expenditures  on  the  Pharmaceutical  Benefits  Scheme,  resulting  in  decreased   expenditures of $384 million in 2002-03, increasing to $510 million in 2005-06.

Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Cessatio n of indexation on petroleum Revenue Replacement Payments foregone and the  implementation  of  a  National  Excise  Scheme  for  Low  Alcohol  Beer,  decreasing  budget   balancing assistance grants to the states and territories by $202 million in 2002-03; and

Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½A package to improve and develop the work capacity of people with disabilities, entailing  an  increase  in  expenses  in  2002-03  and  2003-04,  but  resulting  in  $337  million  of  net   savings over the forward estimates period.

Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Reduced rebates payments due to lower demand for diesel fuel.

Major Revenue Measures



Total revenue is expected to be higher in 2002-03 compared to the Mid-Year Economic and  Fiscal  Outlook,  largely  as  a  result  of  stronger  growth  in  income  tax  revenue  from  small   unincorporated  businesses,  primary  producers  and  companies,  and  higher  indirect  tax  revenue.



Policy decisions that increase revenue over the period 2002-03 to 2005-06 include:



Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Additional  funding  for  the  Australian  Tax  Office  to  improve  its  capacity  to  collect  tax,   expected to increase revenue by $1.5 billion.

Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Deferral  of  some  measures  associated  with  business  tax  reform,  resulting  in  a  revenue    increase of $540 million.
