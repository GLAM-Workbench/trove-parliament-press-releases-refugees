Border Protection Command assists vessel

HMAS Albany assisted a suspected irregular entry vessel 230 nautical miles west of Darwin last night,  within Australia’s search and rescue region under the Safety of Life at Sea Convention.

Initial indications suggest there are 37 passengers and 2 crew on board.

The vessel was initially detected by a Customs and Border Protection Dash-8 aircraft, operating under  the control of Border Protection Command.

The Australian Maritime Safety Authority Rescue Coordination Centre (AMSA) was notified that the  vessel may require assistance and AMSA co-ordinated the initial response.

A nearby commercial vessel attended finding that the vessel had run out of fuel. HMAS Albany also  attended and a doctor assessed the passengers, recommending that two people may need medical  assistance as a precaution.

The two people are being taken to Darwin for precautionary medical assistance, along with  three family members.

The remaining passengers are now being transferred to Christmas Island where they will undergo  security, identity and health checks and their reasons for travel will be established.

While their nationality is yet to be confirmed, if these asylum seekers are Afghans, the processing  suspension introduced by the Government on 9 April 2010 will apply.
