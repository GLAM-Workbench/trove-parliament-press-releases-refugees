Christmas Islanders have a right to be concerned

Christmas Islanders have a right to be outraged and concerned about the arrival, less then 48  hours ago, of the latest boat of asylum seekers.

“The asylum seekers pulled up to the jetty at Christmas Island in their wooden boat and literally  knocked on the detention doors themselves,” Dr Sharman Stone, Shadow Minister for  Immigration and Citizenship said.

“It is outrageous for the Rudd Government to imply or suggest that just because Christmas Island  is 1,000km from mainland Australia, doesn’t mean it’s not part of our country.  It should be  subject to the same border security and detection as any other part of the Australian coast line.”

“Clearly this debacle with the three boats in the last four days all arriving without detection or  appropriate response makes it more and more evident that an urgent inquiry is needed,” Dr  Stone said.

“Leaving the asylum seekers stranded on Warrior Reef for four days is hardly an appropriate way  for Australia to meet its responsibilities to those in distress in International waters or seeking  asylum within Australia’s own territory.”

Dr Stone again repeated her call for an urgent inquiry to sort out just where the problems exist.   In particular, to identify if it is the slashing of resources which is leaving Australia so exposed  right now and unfortunately exposing asylum seekers, in the hands of the people smugglers, to  death at sea.
