THE HON RICHARD MARLES MP  SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND  BORDER PROTECTION  MEMBER FOR CORIO



E&OE TRANSCRIPT  RADIO INTERVIEW   ABC NEWSRADIO WITH MARIUS BENSON  TUESDAY, 18 MARCH 2014

SUBJECT/ S: Asylum  seekers;  7.30  Report  footage;  Science  meets   Parliament.

MARIUS BENSON: Richard Marles, good morning.

RICHARD MARLES, SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND  BORDER PROTECTION: Good morning Marius, how are you?

BENSON: I’m well. That was very dramatic images in the report last night on  7.30 and very strong claims and counterclaims. What action should flow from the  Government as a result, if any, if do you believe?

MARLES: Well, the first thing that ought to come from this is that the  Government needs to start being transparent about what it’s actually doing on  the high seas, it shouldn’t be up to the 7.30 Report to be seeing vision of that for  the Australian people to discover what our services are doing in relation to this  policy. It should simply be a matter of this Government making plain what it is  actually doing out on the high seas and that’s what we would ask them to do.

BENSON: Well now that it is plain to some extent what’s happening out there,  and there are clashes which anyone would believe are inevitable when people  are turned back in the way in which the military are now being ordered to do, do  you believe that action should continue now that it has been made public?

MARLES: Again what we’ve seen is vision, but what we are yet to have is an  explanation from the Government to the country about exactly what it’s doing

and how it’s doing it and so it’s hard to comment on that until we hear exactly  how the Government is going about its business.

But that’s what we need to hear Marius, it’s not good enough on an issue of this  public prominence, on an issue where the Coalition ran so loudly prior to the  election, that after the election what we have is a veil of secrecy and no  comment from the Government at all about exactly what its policies and its  procedures are on the high seas when boats are intercepted.

And that’s what we now need to hear, and I make the point, we have supported  an inquiry in the Senate which will go to the question of exactly what is occurring  on the high seas. It’s now time for the Government to actually come clean and  answer those questions.

BENSON: Can I now change gears entirely on this interview, Richard Marles,  and ask you to take off your Shadow Immigration hat and put on your hat as a  scientist, possibly your lab coat.

Because you are a science graduate yourself, you are co-chair of the Friends of  Science in the Federal Parliament and it’s a bit of a signal day in science because  I was speaking earlier this morning to the astrophysicist Lawrence Krauss about  new information about the first nano seconds after the big bang, there are new  insights into cosmic inflation. Let’s not get lost in technicality - let me ask you,  yesterday the two-day event with scientists visiting Parliament began, it is  continuing today, is it a productive exercise?

MARLES: Look it’s a really productive exercise Marius, and so the Science meets  Parliament component of that event is today, scientists from throughout Australia  will fan out through Parliament House and speak to individual MPs about the  work that they do.

But I think what’s so important about this is that we have a real problem when it  comes to science literacy amongst our elected representatives. There are  precious few of us who have science qualifications here in Parliament and the  degree of understanding about scientific matters and scientific debates is  hopeless to be frank.

I don’t think that there is an area of public policy where the Parliament has so  much to do, where there is so little which is understood about what we do, and  that really needs to change, which is of course why Karen Andrews and I have  set up the Parliamentary Friends of Science but it’s also very much part of the  mission of the Science meets Parliament program which will be happening today.

BENSON: So science is a bit friendless in Parliament as things stand?



MARLES: I think it is friendless but I think it also it’s also a situation where  there is just a lack of literacy. I mean there are very sophisticated debates which  occur in Parliament around a whole range of matters, the economy, trade, social  issues, foreign policy, in depth debates which you would feel proud of as an  Australian that they are occurring within this building.

But when it comes to science, and this is the other point to make, science is in  many respects fundamentally a public endeavour. I mean, you had your  interview today with Dr Krauss, we are a country which is very good at  astrophysics, which is very good at astronomy. Brian Schmidt, whose our most  recent Nobel laureate, based at the ANU, all of that work is being done on the  public purse. Wi-Fi, which is perhaps the most iconic Australian invention of the  last few decades, done on the public purse. You go back into history Einstein,  Isaac Newton did their work on the public purse.

This is fundamentally a public endeavour and for that matter actually largely a  federal public endeavour, so people in this building ought to know what decisions  they are making and understand them, the science literacy in relation to politics  has to change.

BENSON: And can I just mention that for those listeners curious about what  happens in the first billionth of a second of the universe, we will be re-playing  that interview with Lawrence Krauss in about 20 minutes from now, but right  now Richard Marles thank you very much.

MARLES: Thank you very much Marius.
