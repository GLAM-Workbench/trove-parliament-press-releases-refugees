Introduction

In June this year the Attorney-General tabled the Administrative Review Tribunal Bill 2000, the long-awaited shake-up of the Commonwealth administrative review system.

A few weeks ago, the full detail of the proposed new system was revealed when he presented the Administrative Review Tribunal (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2000.

This Bill contains much of the nitty gritty setting out, among other things, the particular rights of parties in various divisions of the proposed tribunal, and appeal mechanisms for each of the hundreds of Acts which give rise to an opportunity for merits review.

Since the Administrative Appeals Tribunal commenced operation in 1976, the administrative review system has grown and evolved over a period of twenty five years with the successive establishment of numerous other specialist tribunals charged with hearing matters in the specialist jurisdictions of social security, migration, refugees and veterans appeals.

While there were good reasons to establish each of the new tribunals, it must be said that the process of evolution occurred on an ad hoc basis.

It was fitting that in December 1993, the Administrative Review Council commenced a review of the operation of the system as a whole.

In its Better Decisions report handed down in 1995, the ARC reached the conclusion that the system would be improved by bringing each of the existing tribunals under one umbrella - a new super tribunal to be called the Administrative Review Tribunal.

It also made a number of very careful recommendations to ensure that the new body would retain its independence and so that the quality of administrative decision-making would not suffer as a result of the rationalisation.

That report is, of course, the basis for the proposal that we are considering today.

The scope of administrative review

In approaching this debate it is important to appreciate the scope and volume of decisions for which any system of administrative review must cater.

Each year, government departments and Commonwealth agencies make more than 50 million decisions that affect the benefits, entitlements and rights of persons and entities inside and outside Australia.

Fortunately only a small percentage of decisions are challenged. But the ability for an ordinary citizen to challenge a decision by Government as manifest in its various forms is fundamental to the quality of our democracy.

The great bulk of decisions - more than 36 million - are made in the social security jurisdiction. In 1997-98, there were 43 074 internal reviews of such decisions by Centrelink officers, 9214 applications for external review by the SSAT and 1735 applications concerning social welfare decisions in the AAT. During the same period there were 33 social security related applications lodged with the Federal Court.

Also in that year, the Australian Taxation Office made more than 10 million decisions involving the amount of tax individuals and companies should pay. Of these, there were 76 229 objections to assessment, 1604 matters were lodged for review by the AAT and 19 taxation appeals were filed in the Federal Court.

While social security and taxation decisions comprise the great bulk of reviewable decisions, our tribunals also handle matters as diverse as workers compensation claims, war veterans and widows entitlements, residence, business and temporary entry visas, customs matters, and business licensing decisions.

Rights

Any move to modify, displace or replace the current arrangements for administrative review must be treated with caution.

Why?

Because embedded within the fabric of the current system is a bundle of fundamental rights that can have a direct bearing on the quality of life of ordinary Australians.

These are rights that many Australians may not even know they have, but which may become vitally important at crucial and often vulnerable times in their lives - when their child suffers an accident and becomes disabled, when they fall on hard times and have to reach out for help, when they are trying to start a new business or maintain a struggling business but can't cut through the red tape.

These rights are written into the laws as a vital check on the power of government officials to make decisions affecting people's lives.

As anybody who has fought for rights of any kind knows, rights are hard won, but easily eroded.

This is especially true of the right to seek review of unfair, unlawful or incorrect government decisions.

That is one reason why Labor is taking very seriously its consideration of the ART proposal that is before us today.

I think that most, if not all, people with an interest in the area would agree that as a whole Australia's system of administrative review is one of the best in the world.

It's based on the concept of a genuine merits review.

A quarter of a century ago, the only generally available option for disputing a government decision was formal judicial review through the Courts. Pursuing such a claim was invariably costly, slow, cumbersome, legalistic and the court only had the capacity to declare the decision lawful or unlawful.

The key feature of merits review is that a tribunal is able to make a fresh decision, based on all the evidence before the tribunal. Tribunal members "stand in the shoes" of the original decision-maker and make use of investigative rather than strictly adversarial techniques to reach the best decision in all the circumstances.

Our interlocking system comprised of the AAT and various specialist tribunals offers applicants with a genuine opportunity for merits review which, for the most part, is independent, inexpensive and quick.

While there is always room for improvement in any system, as a whole Australia's system of administrative review has worked well.

Any proposal which makes fundamental changes to this system must demonstrate how the changes will operate to improve the system and justify any cost savings which are claimed.

Labor's position

Labor supports the creation of an Administrative Review Tribunal in accordance with the recommendation of the Administrative Review Council.

However, we are very concerned that the tribunal that the government is seeking to create departs so significantly from that which was recommended by the Administrative Review Council, it would significantly diminish the quality and independence of administrative review.

The true motivation for the merger appears not to be improving and enhancing the quality and independence of review, but cost savings.

In May this year, the Attorney-General released figures which indicated that the establishment of the ART and the abolition of the existing tribunals (with the exception of the Veterans Review Board) would result in a net saving to the Commonwealth, over four years, of $13.5 million.

Since the May announcement, the commencement date has been pushed back until July 1 next year.

Now that the procedures for review in each of the divisions have been finalised, it will be necessary for the government to re-examine the costings.

Changes to the costings will also be necessary if the Bill requires significant amendment. For example, any modification of the grounds for a second-tier review will require the tribunal to be better resourced to deal with a greater number of second-tier appeals.

We believe that these cost savings claimed by the government are open to question and we will be pressing the government in Estimates hearings in December for a better explanation of how these savings will be made.

Cracks in the glass

When the government first floated the idea of a single merits review tribunal in 1997, the new Administrative Review Tribunal was also to subsume the role of the Veterans Review Board.

The government subsequently conceded, after a decisive campaign mounted by veterans groups, that the Veterans Review Board would be excluded from the amalgamation proposal.

As a result, the VRB will continue to exist, and veterans will be able to seek review of decisions of the Board in the Veterans Appeals Division of the ART.

This concession was a significant departure from the model recommended in 1995 by the Administrative Review Council.

It was a concession made in an attempt to reassure veterans that their hard-won rights of administrative review in veterans matters would not be diminished as a result of the other changes to the administrative appeals system.

Veterans, however, are not convinced.

While their rights of appeal have been preserved, there are serious concerns that the quality of decision-making by the Veterans Appeals Division of the ART will not match that of the current Administrative Appeals Tribunal given the restrictions on qualifications and experience that will be imposed on appointments to the ART.

Nevertheless, the decision to exempt Veterans was an early concession which casts serious doubt on the government's claim that the new tribunal will "improve and enhance the Commonwealth system of administrative review".

If the ART model is supposed to improve and enhance merits review, why was it necessary to carve out the Veterans Review Board from its scope? Aren't Veterans and their families equally as entitled to share in the benefits of an improved system.

The answer is that the ART model is a step backwards, rather than a step forwards, in administrative review.

It is unquestionably a step backwards, rather than a step forwards, in improving the confidence that Australians have in government. Veterans are justified in saying that they are not prepared to cop it. But so are we all.

The ART model is budget-driven and not motivated by a genuine desire to improve the quality of administrative review. It will fundamentally compromise the ability of citizens to hold government to account for unfair, unlawful or simply misconceived decisions.

Specific problems with the ART model

Vital to the health and credibility of any system of administrative review is that the system operates independently from the original decision-makers, and members are able to approach the task of merits review free of improper or heavy-handed Ministerial control.

It is also important that the system be established in such a way that the decisions which are made are of the highest quality. To achieve this, the system must be adequately resourced, there must be an appropriate balance of leadership, expertise and skills among tribunal members, and the procedures for hearing of matters must be fair and accessible.

I would like to touch today on a number of areas in which the proposed ART falls short in tests of its independence and the quality of review.

Structure of the ART

First, the structure of the new tribunal.

The ART will comprise six Divisions which broadly reflect the jurisdiction of the existing divisions of the AAT and the specialist tribunals.

It will have a President, six executive members (one appointed to head each Division), senior members and other members.

Significantly, the total number of senior members will be restricted to not more than 10 per cent of the total number of members, and not more than 15 per cent of the total number of members in any Division.

I believe that this restriction will significantly impact on the ability of the ART to deal with matters which are complex or which require greater expertise to resolve.

While the purpose of the restriction is to reduce running costs of the ART by staffing it more cheaply, the resultant loss of experience will adversely affect the quality of decision-making by the ART.

Currently, approximately 30% of members of the AAT are senior members. Senior members not only play an important role in adjudicating more complex cases, but they also contribute to the training and professional development of less experienced tribunal members.

The lack of tenure for full time members of the tribunal will also diminish the independence of the tribunal.

All members, including the President, will be appointed on renewable fixed term contracts. There will be a maximum term of 7 years, but no minimum term.

Accordingly, it will be possible for the government to appoint ART members with terms of only 2 or 3 years.

This lack of tenure for full time members of the ART is completely unacceptable as it will place members at risk of being replaced at the end of their terms if their decisions are not viewed favorably by the government of the day.

It will significantly curb the independence of the tribunal as it seriously impinges on the duty

of members to perform their review functions without looking to the prospect of reappointment.

Funding of the ART

Labor also sees problems with the model for funding the tribunal.

Each Division of the ART will be funded directly by the portfolio agency whose decisions it is responsible for reviewing.

This will make the President and executive members responsible for negotiating annual funding agreements with the very Ministers and Departments they will be responsible for reviewing.

Not only will this place an additional bureaucratic burden on the most senior people in the ART which will reduce the time available for those members to assist with the most important functions of the tribunal - that of review - it will also seriously compromise the independence of the tribunal.

It will leave the door open for pressure to be imposed over the ART by the Executive Government by restricting, or indeed threatening to restrict, the funding for particular Divisions of the ART.

This directly contradicts a key recommendation of the ARC, that funding should not be provided from those agencies whose decisions are to be reviewed by the tribunal.

While the SSAT, RRT and MRT are currently funded as part of their respective portfolios, the AAT is resourced though the Attorney-General's department.

Funding for the AAT should be based on a single appropriation from the Attorney-Generals Department.

The creation of the ART offers an opportunity to place the funding of all divisions on this more independent basis.

Appointment, qualifications and removal of members of the ART

The manner of appointment of tribunal members will also undermine the independence of the ART.

All members will be appointed to a Division upon the recommendation of the Minister whose department will be subject to review by that Division.

The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs will approve the appointment of members in the Immigration and Refugee Division.

The Minister for Social Security will approve the appointment of such members to the Income Support Division.

The Attorney-General will be responsible for approving the appointment of members to the Commercial and General Division.

While current appointments to the SSAT, MRT and RRT are made by the Minister for Social Security and the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs respectively, the establishment of the ART offers an opportunity for the appointment process to be improved so that portfolio Ministers in these areas are not directly responsible for appointing those persons who will be required, in appropriate cases, to make decisions which are contrary to the interests of the relevant Minister.

There are many better alternatives to the arrangement proposed by the Bill. One would be for members to be appointed solely on the recommendation of the Attorney-General.

Another alternative would be to empower an independent body comprised of a representative appointed by the Attorney-General, the President of the ART, the Commonwealth Ombudsman and the Chairman of the Administrative Review Council to conduct selection interviews and make arms-length recommendations to the Attorney-General.

It is also very surprising that the ART Bill does not prescribe any minimum qualifications for the President of the ART. This departs from the recommendation of the Better Decisions report, which concluded that the President:

would need to have high legal skills, high level experience in decision-making and dispute resolution, and an ability to determine authoritatively any decision from the diverse range of matters that would come before the tribunal. These qualities would ordinarily (but not necessarily) be found in a person who is a judge, or who has legal skills broadly equivalent to that of a judge.

Ã¢ÂÂÃ¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»

While I am aware that the Attorney is on record as saying that he would "expect" the President to have legal qualifications, I am at a loss as to why minimum qualifications have not been included in the establishing legislation.

Qualifications for other members are not specified in the Bill, nor have they been made public.

There is no indication whether ART members will need to possess the minimum core skills recommended by the Council: understanding of merits review, knowledge of administrative review principles, analytical skills, personal skills and attributes and communications skills.

Given the Howard government's record of political appointments to senior public service roles, we can have no confidence in the absence of public selection criteria that appropriate people will be appointed to the tribunal.

The greatly expanded powers of removal of tribunal members are also of concern.

Currently, an AAT member who is not a judge can be removed by the Governor-General only if both Houses of Parliament in the same session pass a resolution to remove the member for proved misbehavior or incapacity, or the member becomes bankrupt.

While the protection given to the President of the ART is similar to that currently afforded to the President of the AAT, the ART Bill provides a much looser mechanism to remove executive, senior and ordinary members of the ART.

While some expansion of the grounds on which tribunal members can be removed would appear to be justified, I am concerned that the ability to remove members on grounds relating

to performance agreements, the code of conduct, or directions of the President have the potential to invite highly subjective and inappropriate assessments of members' performance to be made.

This is particularly the case if the performance agreements or directions place members in a position where they are required to rush through review hearings to meet unreasonable targets which advance the goals of efficiency but compromise the quality of the review.

Availability of second-tier review

The scope for second-tier review of decisions of the ART is very narrow.

In order to qualify for a second-tier review, applicants will need to show one of two things, either:

1. that the first review was heard by a single member and the case raises a principle, or issue, of general significance; or Ã¢ÂÂÃ¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»

2. that the parties to the first review agree that the decision involved a manifest error. Ã¢ÂÂÃ¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»

These conditions are so stringent that it will be almost impossible to qualify for second-tier review.

While this will create the hypothetical possibility of second-tier review for some decisions for which such review is currently not available (for example, some taxation and workers compensation decisions), the practical impact will be that only a handful of cases will meet the requirements.

The second ground of appeal is pure fantasy. Never, in all my years of legal practice, have I seen a decision which both the successful and the unsuccessful party would have been happy to agree that it involved a "manifest error" justifying an appeal. For veterans, and putting aside for the time being arguments about the quality of decision making given the different qualifications and experience levels required of ART members, their appeal rights will be preserved.

However, other applicants before the proposed ART will almost always have only one chance at review. And applicants in migration and refugee matters will have no right to second-tier review whatsoever - something which will place additional burden on the Federal Court, to which applicants will turn by default.

This prompts an obvious question, to which I believe the government has no credible answer.

If the government accepts the need for an accessible second-tier review mechanism for veterans, why is the same opportunity not provided for taxpayers, social security recipients, migrants and refugees, disabled people, businesses affected by customs or licencing decisions or employees who have been denied workers compensation?

Legal representation

The quality of administrative review that will be available under the new ART is further compromised by the fact that there is no longer a right to representation for persons appearing before the tribunal.

In other words, representation will be at the discretion of the Tribunal.

It will also be possible for Ministers to make Practice and Procedure Directions which completely exclude legal or other representation in certain classes of cases.

The implications of this are enormous.

Firstly, the government has stated improved efficiency as one of the primary motivations for forming the ART.

However, in its recent Managing Justice report, the Australian Law Reform Commission found that legal representatives have the potential to enhance the efficiency of tribunals by firstly vetting out frivolous or unmeritorious claims and also in adequately preparing the parties who will be appearing before the tribunal as well as assisting the tribunal to identify and work through the issues.

Many of the issues that come before our tribunals - in particular, the AAT - are extremely complex and technical. Legal representatives are able to assist the tribunal in the interpretation and clarification of the legal and factual issues.

Restrictions on the participation of legal representatives would in all probability actually increase the number of matters that are brought before the tribunal and the prospects of achieving a settlement of matters. Experience shows that unrepresented litigants inevitably increase the length and hence the cost of those cases that proceed to hearing.

Many people appealing to the ART may have language barriers or disabilities that may exacerbate the difficulties they face in appearing before the Tribunal, let alone explaining the complex issues of their case. Representation makes an unfamiliar and often unfathomable process more accessible to many people who have been adversely affected by the decision of a government department.

The ALRC concluded in its report that:

…legislation, policy and practice concerning federal review tribunal proceedings should focus, not on excluding, but on better defining and managing representatives. Any provisions for ART management of party and representative participation should be judiciously targeted to allow management, not inappropriate restriction, of representation or participation.

Ã¢ÂÂÃ¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»

The provisions for representation in the ART package completely fail this test.

In my experience you can not underestimate the contribution that an objective professional adviser can make to a sensible resolution of disputes at all levels.

Ministerial control over practice and procedure of the ART

Under the proposed system, the conduct of ART members and staff will be constrained by administrative practice and procedure directions.

Disturbingly, the Minister whose decisions will be reviewable by a Division will be able to issue directions which will apply within that Division. The Minister's directions will prevail over those of the President and executive members.

In lay terms, this means that Ministers will be able instruct the tribunal as to how it must make particular types of decisions.

Again, this is an inappropriate interference in the work of the ART and its capacity to regulate its own practice and procedure.

Ministers should have no role in regulating the conduct of the independent body responsible for reviewing their Department's decisions.

That Ministers are permitted to do so affects not only the independence of the tribunal but also its perceived independence.

Confidence in the system of merits review requires a proper distance between the Executive Government and the body which is established to provide applicants with an opportunity to have decisions independently reviewed.

Conclusion

While Labor does not oppose the amalgamation of merits review tribunals to provide a more streamlined and efficient system of Commonwealth administrative review, we have grave concerns that the model which was been advanced by the government is a step backwards, rather than a step forwards.

In 1998, while the detail of the proposed tribunal was still under wraps, Justice Jane Mathews of the Federal Court suggested that "the proposed amalgamation constitutes such a downgrading of the merits review system as to fundamentally threaten the quality and independence of external merits review".

Now that the full detail of the government's model is available for scrutiny, it appears that those early fears are well-founded.

The Bills propose the creation of a new merits review tribunal in which the quality and independence of merits review will be substantially diminished.

In many ways, this proposal draws on the worst elements of each of the tribunals that are being amalgamated.

When Parliament resumes, the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party will be meeting to determine its approach to the two ART Bills.

I am grateful to the organisers of this forum for the opportunity to hear from those of you who are in close contact with the existing system. Your feedback will be very useful in finalising our position on the Bills.

Thank you.
