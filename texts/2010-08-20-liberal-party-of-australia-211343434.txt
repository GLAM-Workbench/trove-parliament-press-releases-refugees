E&OE……………………….………………………………………………………………………………..

TONY ABBOTT:

Thanks everyone for being here. It’s been a long road and we’ve got just a bit further to go together. Look,  at the beginning of this campaign I said that Australians faced a very clear choice and I think over the course  of the campaign the choice has just got clearer. If the Government is re-elected we’ll have more debt, more  deficits, more boats, more backflips and more leadership tension. If the Government is re-elected the debt  will just increase at the rate of more than $100 million a day every single day and what we know with Labor  governments is that they just get worse if they get a second term.

By contrast, if the Coalition is elected people know what they’ll get. They’ll get an end to the waste, they’ll  get debt and deficit repaid, they’ll get no big new taxes and they’ll get no boats. Our objective is very clear.  We will end the waste, we will pay back the debt, we will stop the big new taxes and we will stop the boats.  That’s not all we’ll do though. Over the first term of a Coalition government we would get people power in  our schools and hospitals. We would get direct action on climate change. We would get a 5 per cent cut in  emissions by 2020 and we would get a standing green army, 15,000 strong, to tackle the land care problems  which so bedevil our country. There would be a series of important participation reforms under a Coalition  government. A fair dinkum paid parental leave scheme. A better deal for seniors wanting to stay engaged in  the workforce and a better deal for young people who might otherwise be caught in the trap of  intergenerational welfare dependency. My vision, should I be elected tomorrow, is to move from a welfare  state to an opportunity society.

Now, eight weeks ago the Government on its own admission had lost its way. By sacking its own leader, by  politically assassinating the democratically elected Prime Minister the Government effectively voted no  confidence in itself and since then things have gone from bad to worse. The incoming Prime Minister Julia  Gillard said she’d fix the mining tax but she hasn’t. In fact, the mining tax has already done massive damage  to our economy. We had the news in the last week that Australia’s place in the international rankings of safe  places to invest in mining had dropped by 13 places in just a year thanks to Labor’s great big new tax on  mining. Australia now ranks behind Argentina, Tanzania, Ghana, Namibia and Botswana as a place to do  business in mining. This is the kind of damage that this Government has done. The Prime Minister said  she’d stop the boats but we know that her boats fix got lost somewhere in the Timor Sea and she said she’d  fix climate change but a climate change fix was to subcontract policy making to some kind of nebulous  citizens’ assembly, when that’s the job of Parliament to fix climate change. But now we know that when she  said she’d fix climate change what she really meant was that there would be a carbon price and a carbon  price means a big slug on consumers. A carbon price means effectively an electricity tax.

The Prime Minister has talked a lot about risk, but frankly the only risk in this election is that a really bad  Government might get the second chance that it doesn’t deserve and that Australia can’t afford. So I have a  very clear message to the Australian people as we countdown to election 2010. If you want to stop the boats  you’ve got to change the government. If you want to stop the taxes you’ve got to change the government. If  you want to see a 100,000 cut in immigration you’ve got to change the government. If you want to see a  competent administration you’ve got to change the government and the only way to change the government  is to change your local Labor member of parliament. So that’s my clear message.

I want to say that I have been on a blitz over the last 30 hours or so now. In the last 30 hours to the best of  my reckoning I’ve done six TV interviews, 14 radio interviews, I’ve visited 10 electorates and of course  now this press conference today and look, as far as I am concerned I will keep working. Keep working right  up till six o’clock on Saturday night. I am running for the biggest job in the country and if you’re running for  a big job you’ve got to make a big effort. The Australian people expect no less of the alternative Prime  Minister.

QUESTION:

Does that mean no more sleep tonight?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I’m not saying that I’m going to be quite as busy tonight as I was last night and I’m not expecting to  have the press pack with me all this coming night as I did all of last night. But certainly I’ll be busy until  quite late this evening. It won’t all be in public events but I will be busy until quite late this evening and I’ll  be busy quite early tomorrow morning.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, what is your workplace relations policy? Why haven’t you put out your industrial relations  policy?

TONY ABBOTT:

Patricia, we do have a workplace policy and it’s on the Coalition’s website.

QUESTION:

Eric Abetz has been promising to release that policy for days though now. Why hasn’t he released that?

TONY ABBOTT:

But there is a workplace relations policy on the Coalition website.

QUESTION:

With your superannuation policy, when will that be released?

TONY ABBOTT:

The superannuation policy is also on the Coalition website.

QUESTION:

3

Why have you done nothing on superannuation though? You raised the suggestion with the superannuation  industry and with superannuants that you would do something new, but your policy does nothing new. Why  have you let people down?

TONY ABBOTT:

I’m not sure that that’s entirely accurate. We are guaranteeing that at any age people will still get the  superannuation guarantee. We are promising to give serious consideration to the recommendations of the  Cooper Review. So, we do have a superannuation policy and it’s on the…

QUESTION:

Can you [inaudible] taxes on superannuation? That’s a recommendation of the Henry Review.

TONY ABBOTT:

We don’t intend to do anything other than what we’ve put forward in our superannuation policy.

QUESTION:

You’ve got all the commitments and promises given by yourself, Shadow Ministers, local MPs and  candidates. Are they all rock solid, iron-clad core commitments that you will fulfil in government?

TONY ABBOTT:

We have not made any commitments in this campaign other than those that we think are prudent, affordable  and feasible and all of them are fully costed and fully funded. We believe we can fund all of them out of the  savings that we have announced and even after the new spending commitments that we’ve announced, we  will spend $11.5 billion less than the Labor Party over the forward estimates period. At the end of the  forward estimates period, the debt will be $30 billion less under us than under the Labor Party.

QUESTION:

You say you’ll pay off Labor’s debt. Exactly [inaudible] will you suspend the Government’s borrowing  programme?

TONY ABBOTT:

I just want to say that thanks to the policies that we will pursue, the debt will be $30 billion lower at the end  of the forward estimates period under us than under Labor.

QUESTION:

When will you suspend the borrowing programme though? I’m asking you a specific question. When will  you suspend it?

TONY ABBOTT:

I’m only making commitments to the end of forward estimates period. At the end of the forward estimates  period the debt will be $30 billion less under us than under the Labor Party.

QUESTION:

4

Mr Abbott, you’ve given yourself three months to stop the boats. If, after that three month timeframe, we see  boats arrive into Australia, will you take personal responsibility for that and how many boats will you  accept? How far does your guarantee that you will stop the boats take? Will you step down if a boat arrives  after the three month mark?

TONY ABBOTT:

Obviously as the head of any incoming Coalition government, I would take ultimate political responsibility  for whatever happens under a new government’s watch, of course I would take that responsibility. I think  within three months we could make a very significant difference and what I would be intending to achieve is  the same kind of result that was achieved by the Howard Government and as you know, under the former  Government, between 2002 and 2007, there were on average three boats a year. Under the current  Government, after the policy was weakened, there’ve been on average three boats a week.

QUESTION:

[inaudible] once a year your target. [inaudible] more than three boats a year will you stand down?

TONY ABBOTT:

If I can…

QUESTION:

[inaudible] you said that you were going to stop the boats. That’s quite definitive statement to take to the  public.

TONY ABBOTT:

If I can achieve three boats a year, as opposed to three boats a week I think the Australian public would have  every reason to be grateful to the new government.

QUESTION:

[inaudible] directing preferences to the Greens ahead of Labor in Brisbane, in Grayndler in Sydney and the  seat of Melbourne. Will you consider the election campaign successful if you see the election of a Greens  MP in Melbourne, thanks to Liberal preferences?

TONY ABBOTT:

My hope is to see the election of as many Coalition MPs as possible. That’s my hope and in every seat  where a Coalition MP is not elected, I will regard myself and ourselves as having to that extent failed.

QUESTION:

What message would give to the people who are going to vote Green, in trying to convince them to give you  their second preference?

TONY ABBOTT:

I would say that if you want to preference a major party which has a serious policy, the only major party that  you can preference is the Coalition because we do have a serious, credible policy which has been out there  since February. It will achieve a five per cent emissions reduction target. Labor’s policy is all over the place.

5

On the one hand, it’s to have a Citizens’ Assembly, on the other hand, it’s to have a carbon price. Now,  they’ve got to make up their minds what they want.

QUESTION:

[inaudible] price over the last three years for over promising during the 2007 election and under delivering.  In areas like stopping the boats which is a very definitive statement, are you concerned that if you win, you  may suffer a similar fate to the extent that a lot of your campaign messaging has been very definitive and  you’ve given people the impression that you can stop the boats? What are you going to do when people  work out that you can’t?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, Catherine I think that we can stop the boats. The Coalition stopped the boats before and we can stop  the boats again and what we need to stop the boats is the right policies and the right policies are Temporary  Protection Visas, rigorous offshore processing, including in third countries and as you know I’ll pick up the  phone to the President of Nauru on day one of a Coalition government. I know it won’t be easy and I know  it won’t be possible in all circumstances but where it is possible to do so safely we’ve got to have the option  of turning boats around.

QUESTION:

If you won’t put your own job on the line over stopping the boats, will you put Scott Morrison’s job on the  line over stopping boats and if there are more than three boats, will his job be in jeopardy?

TONY ABBOTT:

I want to say that we will stop the boats. Now, if we can get the number of boats down from three a week to  three a year, as the former Government did, I will regard myself as having very substantially succeeded. I  will regard the government as having very substantially succeeded and I will regard Scott Morrison as  having very substantially succeeded.

QUESTION:

Why not make a commitment like that? Why not put your own job or Scott Morrison’s job on the line on  this question?

TONY ABBOTT:

I know that if we don’t succeed, we will be very harshly judged by the Australian people at the next election.  That’s what elections are about. Elections are an opportunity for the people to pass judgement on the  competence or otherwise of the government and just as I expect the current government to be judged very  harshly for its repeated failures to deliver, should any future government, including my own, be just as inept  in delivering its commitments, well that government should be judged harshly.

QUESTION:

Are you worried you’ve run out of steam, when this is potentially, for a lot of people, the last time they  might see you before they go and tick the ballot paper?

TONY ABBOTT:

James, I would much rather feel exhausted by the end of this election campaign and know that I have given  it everything I possibly could than to finish this election campaign like a spring chicken because, you know,

6

election campaigns are gruelling. They are a test of political parties and of political leadership and I expect  that the Australian people will want me to have been put to the test in this campaign. I think I have been put  to the test and I’m pleased to say that I think I have risen to the challenge.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, experts say that you can change the industrial relations regime by tinkering with the regulations.  Do you guarantee that you won’t touch the regulations?

TONY ABBOTT:

It’s good to see… I’ll come back to it, but it’s good to see that none of you have lost any of your energy as a  result of the long and late night!

QUESTION:

Will you guarantee that you won’t touch the workplace relations regulations?

TONY ABBOTT:

I will absolutely guarantee that WorkChoices in any name is dead, buried and cremated.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, a couple of months ago, Senator Judith Troeth floated the idea of affirmative action for the  Victorian Liberal Party. Is that an idea you would ever countenance?

TONY ABBOTT:

I want the Coalition, I want the Liberal Party to fully reflect the diversity of modern Australia. I really do. I  would like to see more women in the Parliament. I would like to see more women in the senior ranks of both  political parties. I’d like to see the more, if you like, ethnic diversity in our Parliament and I’ve got to say,  one of the things that gives me enormous pride is the fact that there is every chance that as a result of this  election, there will be the first ever Indigenous member of the House of Representatives and I’m very much  hoping that’s going to be Ken Wyatt as the Member for Hasluck, representing the Liberal Party.

QUESTION:

Do you have a strategy for working with the Independents if you need them to form government?

TONY ABBOTT:

As I said, my clear determination, every fibre of my being is directed towards trying to get a Coalition  government.

QUESTION:

You missed two of your major policy announcements this campaign, the NBN and your costings, can you  guarantee if you become Prime Minister, you will be at every major announcement that your government  makes?

TONY ABBOTT:

7

Well, I can guarantee that if the Coalition is elected that Andrew Robb will be the Finance Minister, that  Julie Bishop will be the Foreign Minister and David Johnstone will be the Defence Minister. I can tell you  who my Ministers will be in a way that the Prime Minister can’t. Let me continue. You said that I wasn’t  present at our costings announcement. Well, I tell you, at least we made a costings announcement. Earlier  today, sneaked onto the Labor Party’s website was their costings announcement, it wasn’t even fronted by  the Treasurer, let alone by the Treasurer and the Prime Minister and it’s not a great surprise as to why the  Treasurer and the Prime Minister didn’t want to front that announcement because it revealed that in the next  financial year, Labor’s deficit will actually be a half a billion great than tipped so, they snuck out their  costings within 24 hours of the election, without it going through the Charter of Budget Honesty, the Labor  Party are complete and utter hypocrites on this issue.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, you seem to be quietly confident here. Do you think you’ve got this in the bag?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, I’ve said right throughout this election campaign that I am the underdog. I think that out there, the  public are very disappointed with the Government. I think they are very concerned with the way our  democracy has been taken over by the faceless men of the Labor factions. Whatever they think about Kevin  Rudd as Prime Minister, I think they’re very concerned at the way he’s been politically executed, but despite  all of that, I am running against an incumbent Federal Government, against five incumbent State Labor  Governments, against the $1 billion political war machine which is the union movement and I’m running  against 79 years of history.

QUESTION:

You said you’d been to ten electorates in your blitz so far and yet, in most of those appearances you seem to  be with a fairly sympathetic audience. Why are you not going out and talking to undecided voters like you  said you would and could you name the electorates?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, Ben, you guys were there. You know where I’ve been and I’m not going to go through a travelogue  for your benefit, but I think that as anyone who was at the markets this morning would know, as anyone who  was in Chinatown last night would know, they were standard Australian audiences. There was no stacking of  the people who were at the markets , there was no stacking of the people who were at the fish markets and  I’ve got to say that I was extremely buoyed by the response because I think that the common denominator in  all of these places is that people feel let down by the Government.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott you have made much of how much you care about Kevin Rudd and his execution and you know,  you’re very sympathetic to his cause. If you win tomorrow and Kevin Rudd may leave Parliament, I mean  the whole world may change if you become Prime Minister, would you look at giving him an overseas  posting or looking after him the way the Labor Party has not?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, certainly I will treat the former Prime Minister Mr Rudd with more respect than his political  colleagues have. I’d certainly treat him with more respect. He may not have been a great Prime Minister and  for that reason and for no other, he deserves to be treated with respect, but I imagine barring a landslide, that  he will continue to be the Member for Griffith after the election and I think being a Member of Parliament is

8

a full time job. I think he will have more than enough to do representing the people of Griffith after the  election. Thanks very much. Thank you.
