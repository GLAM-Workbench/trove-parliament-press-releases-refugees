TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH THE OPPOSITION LEADER IN THE SENATE  AND THE SHADOW MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS, SENATOR ROBERT HILL,  BY MATTHEW ABRAHAM OF 2CN (ABC) AT 8.45AM ON FRIDAY, APRIL 5,  1991.

MA SENATOR HILL, GOOD MORNING.

RH GOOD MORNING, MATTHEW.

MA SENATOR HILL, WE HAD JOHN HEWSON CELEBRATING HIS FIRST YEAR  AS OPPOSITION LEADER - DID YOU BUY HIM A  CAKE?

RH NO - I HEARD A  REPORT THAT HE HAD A  GLASS OF AUSTRALIAN

CHAMPAGNE AND A CAKE WITH HIS STAFF. BUT YESTERDAY WE HAD  A  FULL DAY OF THE SHADOW CABINET HERE IN SYDNEY. REALLY,  I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY REASON TO REST ON OUR LAURELS.  WE'RE VERY PLEASED WITH OUT FIRST YEAR SINCE THE ELECTION,

IN THAT THE ATMOSPHERE IN THE PARTY IS MUCH BETTER. AND  WHAT WE'RE CONCENTRATING ON LARGELY NOW IS BUILDING UP OUR  OWN CREDIT, GETTING THE POLICIES RIGHT, GETTING THE

PROGRAMME FOR IMPLEMENTATION SO THAT, WHEN WE COME TO THE  NEXT ELECTION, IT WON'T SIMPLY BE THE GOVERNMENT BEING  REJECTED, BUT A  COMMUNITY THAT HAS CONFIDENCE IN THE

ALTERNATIVE WE HAVE TO OFFER.

MA IS THERE A  DANGER THAT THERE MAY BE SOME COMPLACENCY THERE,  THAT GOVERNMENT IS GOING TO FALL INTO YOUR LAP?

RH WELL, THERE'S BEEN NO SIGN OF IT ON OUR PART AND THAT'S

GOOD. I GUESS IN PART IT'S A  RESULT OF A  LONG PERIOD IN

OPPOSITION. BUT THERE IS, NOW, A  REAL DETERMINATION TO  REBUILD OUR PUBLIC CREDIBILITY AND TO GET IN AND DO THE JOB  WELL. AND THAT FEELING THAT WE DON'T WANT TO WIN FOR THE

SAKE OF WINNING, BUT TO WIN TO DO SOMETHING FOR AUSTRALIA  THAT'S BETTER THAN WHAT IT'S GETTING AT THE MOMENT, IS

APPARENT THROUGHOUT THE PARTY AND IT WAS A STRONG SENTIMENT  IN YESTERDAY'S MEETING. SO I THINK THAT'S A  GOOD SIGN.  THE PARTY'S BECOME VERY PROFESSIONAL IN THE LAST YEAR.

MA SENATOR HILL, IT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY TOO, AS SENATE LEADER.  CONGRATULATIONS.

RH THANK YOU.

MA WHAT'S BEEN THE HIGHLIGHT OF THE PAST YEAR?

COMMONWEALTH  PARLIAMENTARY LIBRARY  MICAH

RH WELL, AGAIN I THINK WHAT I'VE BEEN PARTICULARLY PLEASED  ABOUT IS THE WAY THAT WE'VE RECEIVED FULL CO-OPERATION IN  THE SENATE. I GUESS OUR LEADER CAN ASK NO MORE THAN THE

FEELING THAT EVERYONE IS IN THERE TOWARDS THE ONE OBJECTIVE  AND WORKING TOGETHER. AND THIS SPIRIT OF BACKING EACH  OTHER UP IS SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN MISSING FOR SOME

CONSIDERABLE TIME. WE'VE EXPERIENCED IT IN THE LAST YEAR -  I'VE CERTAINLY DONE MY BEST TO ENCOURAGE IT - AND I'M

PLEASED THAT IT'S THERE AT THE MOMENT, AND I THINK IT'S A  GOOD SIGN FOR THE FUTURE.

MA SO, IT SEEMS IN YOUR VIEW THAT WHAT WAS VERY DEBILITATING,  THAT THE ROUND ROBIN OF HOWARD-PEACOCK LEADERSHIP TENSIONS  WITHIN YOUR PARTY FOR SO LONG IS GONE NOW. IS THAT

COMPLETELY PURGED FROM THE PARTY?

RH YES, I THINK IT IS. AND I'VE GOT TO GIVE A FAIR AMOUNT OF

CREDIT TO JOHN HEWSON. AS YOU KNOW, I WENT TO TAIWAN WITH  JOHN LAST WEEK - AND THAT WAS A  FAIRLY DIFFICULT

ASSIGNMENT. AND I HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT HE REALLY DID  HANDLE IT WELL. I WENT ALSO WITH HIM TO BEIJING LAST YEAR  - AND WHILST I THOUGHT HE HANDLED THAT WELL, IT REALLY WAS  APPARENT THAT HE'D ALREADY GROWN SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE JOB

DURING THE INTERVENING PERIOD. AND HE STILL, I THINK,  ACKNOWLEDGES THAT HE IS VERY MUCH ON A  LEARNING CURVE, AND  PUT ANOTHER YEAR BEHIND HIM AND HE WILL OFFER EXCEPTIONAL  LEADERSHIP FOR AUSTRALIA. AND I THINK THAT HAS BEEN A

PRINCIPAL FACTOR IN REUNITING THE PARTY AND ALLOWING US TO  FINALLY CONCENTRATE ON THE REAL ENEMY.

ÃÂÃ‘ I NOTICE HIS MINDERS SHIELD HIM FROM TOO MUCH PRESS

EXPOSURE. IS THAT DELIBERATE? AND IS THAT AN AWARENESS OF  THE FACT THAT HE MAY BE A  BIT NAIVE IN HANDLING THE MEDIA?

RH I DON'T THINK SO. I DON'T THINK THAT HE'S BEEN

PARTICULARLY SHIELDED. IN FACT, I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT HE'S  FAIRLY OPEN. EVERY TIME THAT I'VE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH HIM  WHEN THE PRESS HAVE WANTED TO SPEAK TO HIM, THEY'VE BEEN  ABLE TO. IN SOME WAYS HE'S NOT SOMEONE WHO IS JUMPING IN  WITH A  QUICK GRAB OR A, YOU KNOW, THE 30 SECONDS FOR THE

NEWS. HE IS SOMEONE WHO DOES TRY TO REFLECT ON THE WORK

THAT HE'S DOING, AND SAY SOMETHING WHEN THERE IS SOMETHING  WORTHWHILE TO SAY. AND THAT'S IN THE NATURE OF THE PERSON,  I THINK.

MA IF WE CAN MOVE ONTO ONE OF YOUR AREAS OF PORTFOLIO

INTEREST. OF COURSE, AS OPPOSITION SPOKESMAN ON FOREIGN  AFFAIRS AND THE KURDS, YOU COULD ARGUE THAT IF THIS IS THE  NEW WORLD ORDER, THE KURDS SEEM TO HAVE MISSED OUT BADLY.

RH THEY CERTAINLY HAVE. I THINK IT'S REALLY APPALLING THE WAY  THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY HAS DESERTED THE MINORITIES,  NOT JUST THE KURDS IN IRAQ, SINCE THE END OF THE WAR. IT'S  WORSE, I GUESS, IN THE SENSE THAT THE INTERNATIONAL

ALLIANCE ENCOURAGED THE KURDS TO TAKE ACTION AGAINST SADDAM  HUSSEIN AND, HAVING ENCOURAGED THEM TO DO SO, WE NOW STAND  BACK AND WATCH THEM BEING MASSACRED. I RECALL THE

SITUATION IN THE PAST, DURING THE 1980s, WHEN SADDAM

HUSSEIN APPLIED CHEMICAL WEAPONS TO THE KURDS WITHIN HIS  COUNTRY/ AND THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY STOOD ASIDE. AND  I REALLY DO ASK THE QUESTION WHAT HAS CHANGED? WE MAY SAY  THAT THERE IS, TO SOME EXTENT, A  NEW WORLD ORDER IN

RELATION TO DISPUTES BETWEEN STATES. BUT CERTAINLY I DON'T  THINK ANYONE IN THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY SHOULD BE  PROUD OF WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE MIDDLE EAST AT THE MOMENT.  IT OUGHT TO BE PART OF THE RESOLUTION ON THE CEASE FIRE,

THAT HE WOULD BE OBLIGED TO RESPECT THE INTERESTS OF

MINORITIES. AND I REALLY THINK THE FACT THAT THE SECURITY  COUNCIL HASN'T BEEN ABLE TO ACHIEVE THAT - THAT THE MAJOR  STATES HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO AGREE ON IT - IS REALLY QUITE  DISCOURAGING.

MA DO WE HAVE THEIR BLOOD ON OUR HANDS?

RH WELL WE CAN'T TAKE THE GOOD AND REJECT THE BAD. AS FAR AS

I KNOW, WE HAVEN'T BEEN IN THERE LOBBYING FOR THE SECURITY  COUNCIL RESOLUTION ON THE CEASE FIRE TO INCLUDE PROTECTIONS  FOR MINORITIES WITHIN IRAQ. I BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD HAVE  BEEN. I REALLY SEE NO REASON WHY WE SHOULDN'T. I KNOW

THERE ARE VERY FINE TECHNICAL ARGUMENTS ABOUT WHETHER OR  NOT IT NOW BECOMES AN INTERNAL DISPUTE. BUT THE UN, IN

RECENT YEARS, HAS EXPANDED ITS ROLE IN NATION BUILDING AND  INTERNAL MATTERS - I THINK OF NAMIBIA, I THINK OF NICARAGUA  - AND IN ANY EVENT, THIS HAS GOT SO MANY ASPECTS OF

INTERNATIONALISM - NOT ONLY THE ENCOURAGEMENT, AS I SAID,  OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY FOR THE KURDS TO RISE UP -  BUT ALSO THE REFUGEE ASPECTS, AND THAT THIS CONFLICT, THIS  INTERNAL CONFLICT, HAS, REALLY, COME OUT OF THE EXTERNAL  WAR. SO I DON'T THINK IT'S A BRIGHT SPOT FOR THE

INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AT ALL. AND I'M DISAPPOINTED THAT  AUSTRALIA HASN'T BEEN IN THERE PREPARED TO INDICATE THAT  THE NEW WORLD ORDER SHOULD ALSO PROVIDE SOME SAFEGUARD FOR  MINORITIES AGAINST THE SORT OF ABUSE THAT THEY'RE RECEIVING

(FROM) SADDAM HUSSEIN.

MA SENATOR HILL, THANK YOU, VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME.

RH THANK YOU MATTHEW.
