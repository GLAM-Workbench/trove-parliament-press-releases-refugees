DOORSTOP: RUDDOCK WELCOMES NEW BUS INDUSTRY DISABILITY  STANDARDS & ANSWERS QUESTIONS ON LISTING OF TERRORIST  ORGANISATIONS



ATTORNEY-GENERAL PHILIP RUDDOCK:

Well you may or may not have heard my comments but disabilities affect a lot of people. And  in many ways you find that, even in your own families, there are people who have various  degrees of disability and I just observe that, in relation to my own late father, he had a  degenerative muscular disease that impacted upon his lower limbs, and it left him seriously  impaired in terms of being able to play sport, in terms of access to buildings, and so on.

So in a real sense, I see developments of this sort in which public transport is being made  more accessible is something that responds to very genuine and very real desires from people  who have disabilities of various degrees, to be able to participate fully in life.

And I'm pleased that there has been, working with the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity  Commission and in this case the bus industry, a willingness to address by developing  standards at the way in which over time you upgrade your equipment to be able to deliver  access for people with disabilities. So it's a significant development today and I was pleased  to be able to launch the guidelines.

QUESTION:



Okay, and so today this is obviously a sample bus.  Is this going to be a nationwide thing?  Is  it going to be…?

PHILIP RUDDOCK:

Look this is built in accordance with guidelines that have been developed by the industry and,  as the industry replaces its equipment, they'll be required to produce a product that meets the  guidelines.  Now it won't happen everywhere tomorrow.  This is a gradual program of  implementation of standards that the industry recognises are important and I think the bus and  coach operators have demonstrated a commitment to good public standards for assisting  people who have disabilities.

QUESTION:



And is there a deadline for the implementation?  Long term?

PHILIP RUDDOCK:

No, well I mean most buses have a life against which they're depreciated and the standard is  intended, not as a prescriptive, the standard is intended to produce an outcome over time.   And it has to be something that is affordable and you can impose standards which  significantly increase costs or you can do it gradually.  This is being done gradually.

QUESTION:



Mr Ruddock, do you think you'll be successful in getting the Senate to sit next week to try and  pass the legislation to have those two terrorist groups outlawed?

PHILIP RUDDOCK:

Well I don't know.  The point will be made that the legislation will in fact operate from the  date of the announcement of the Government's intention to implement it.  But of course, if the  Senate were to disapprove of it, that would be a significant factor.  I don't believe that will be  the case.

But the Senate also has requirements which the Opposition hints to in relation to passage.   And I don't know whether or not the Greens and the Democrats are going to co-operate in  relation to its passage.  If they were not, and the Labor Party was not prepared to vote with the  Government, the passage could be a pretty long and tedious matter.

And the point I've been making and it's a point of very significant substance - it's not  something you can dismiss.  There is no certainty that you're able to get the Parliament  together quickly to pass a specific statute.  I mean it's all right to say you can do it in this  instance because you put everything else to one side.  And it might be able to be done in this  instance if people lean upon the Senate to be co-operative.

But I think it demonstrates very clearly if you have to legislate each and every time that there  is a terrorist organisation that needs to be prescribed, that is not a very sensible system for  dealing with that issue.

There is a system by which the legislature recognises that you can deal with issues quickly  and expeditiously and that involves the passage of regulations which can still be disallowed  by the Parliament.  And that's the point I've made.  This is not removing from the Parliament  the opportunity for public scrutiny and parliamentary involvement in saying, look, we think  this goes too far.  It can still do that with regulations.

And why the Labor Party has set its sights against regulations, it seems to me, has more to do  with not wanting to admit that their opposition was a mistake than the good sense in terms of  dealing with the public policy question.

QUESTION:



But do you think that there's an imminent threat to Australia if these two organisations in  specific aren't outlawed soon?

PHILIP RUDDOCK:

The point I have made is that we have received advice from the competent authority - in this  case it's ASIO - that one of the organisations, both of which are known to be terrorist  organisations abroad, one of them has linkages into Australia.

And so the question is, when can you avail yourselves of the additional powers that a  prescribed terrorist organisation is subject to. And the fact is, the longer you leave it when  you've had that advice, the greater the risk.  And I can't say that there is an imminent threat.   All I can say is that the powers to deal with terrorist organisations prescribed are not  available, regulations can't be made, until the enactment is made.

And in my view, given the advice that we have had, I think those powers are 1) needed; and  2) the enactment ought to be as quickly as possible.  I mean that's why we're not sitting there  saying, look pass our bill that's waiting in the Senate.  It's why we've had to say, look, we will  bring in a bill, a specific bill because we know that that's all that the Opposition will agree to.  But it is not the best way of dealing with these issues.  The best way would be to support the  bill that's been in the Senate since June.

QUESTION:



Coastwatch: [Indistinct] Robert McClelland has been quite critical of Coastwatch's inaction  over the arrival of asylum seekers.  What's your response to him?

PHILIP RUDDOCK:

Well look, what I notice is that the Opposition is quick to blame authorities that have very  difficult tasks.  And the real issue here in relation to Coastwatch is that it does have a very  substantial remit.  It's been considerably expanded.  Its role is to identify vessels that might be  of concern and to report it to competent authorities. There may be occasions in which it  misses.  That is disappointing when it happens but I think one has to be reasonable in terms of  what you are able to do when you are searching very vast areas of ocean off Australia.

The broader question that the Labor Party has to address has been raised by my colleague,  Amanda Vanstone, and that is the extent to which they are prepared to support measures that  will send a very clear signal abroad that Australia is not again open for business, the business  of people smuggling.

And the people smuggling issue is a serious issue in which it is fuelled by expectations.  And  if you relent in relation to the measures that the Government has enacted and it seems that the  Opposition wants to deny some of those measures, then you are sending a very clear signal to  people smugglers that our measures are winding down.

QUESTION:



And Labor’s renewed their calls for a coastguard.  What’s your response to that?

PHILIP RUDDOCK:

Well, look, a coastguard is merely taking equipment that is in the hands of the Navy, and  others that’s in the hands of Customs, and re-badging it.  We have a very extensive coast  watch arrangement, with high levels of co-operation between Customers, who are on coast

watch, and the Australian military, that have a number of patrol vessels, and is operating  Operation Relics off the north of Australia. So the fact is that the idea that you can re-badge  organisations that are already operational, and that you’ve got some magic bullet to deal with  smuggling is - is very naÃÂ¯ve.  Okay?

UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: Thank you.
