PEACE IN THE MIDDLE EAST

Address by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade,  Senator Gareth Evans, to the Annual Conference of the  Executive Council of Australian Jewry, Melbourne, 11  December 1988

This is my first opportunity as Minister for Foreign  Affairs and Trade to speak to the leadership of Australian  Jewry. I want today to say something about the Middle East  peace process and about Australia's relations with Israel:

issues which I know are close to the heart of Australian  Jewry.

Australia has always been a friend of Israel. And the  Australian Labor Party has had a special affinity with  Israel from the moment Israel was established. Our  commitment to Israel traces back to Bert Evatt who played

an important role in the United Nation’s decision on the  creation of Israel.  Australia was the first country to  vote "yes” at the UN for Israel's right to exist :  a vote  cast by the Chifley Government.  And successive generations  of Labor Party supporters have identified with the liberal  democratic and democratic socialist traditions of Israel's

founders.

Since then our friendship and commitment has not wavered.   We have consistently opposed moves in international forums  to restrict Israeli participation in the councils of  nations. We vigorously opposed the UN resolution which  equated Zionism with racism. So much so that the

Australian Parliament - in a rare demonstration of

unanimity - called for the overturning of that resolution.  We were the first Parliament to do so, and since then our  lead has been followed by the legislatures of Canada and  the United States.

2

So Australian Jewry can have no doubts about the commitment  of this, and previous Australian Governments to a supportive  and substantial relationship with Israel., As I said before  the world community in my first speech to the United  General Assembly in October this year :  "The right of

Israel to exist within secure and recognised boundaries is  and must remain an indispensable condition of peace".  .

I emphasise our close relations not only because I regard  the .  relationship as an important one, but also because I  want you to know that my comments today on the very serious  problems and challenges facing Israel are the comments of a

friend. And true friendship, I am sure you will agree,  both reguires and accommodates frankness.

This past year has been a significant one in the Middle  East. There was the ceasefire - which we all hope will  stick - in the long and bitter war between Iran and Iraq :   a war that brought suffering or death to several hundred  thousand and which coldly challenged international norms  against the use of chemical weapons.  The year also saw the  uprising in the Occupied Territories continue unabated;

important but inconclusive elections in Israel; a revised  but so far unsuccessful US peace initiative; and, most  recently, the meeting in Algiers of The Palestine National  Council and the subsequent statements in Sweden by Yasser  Arafat.

The uprising in the Occupied Territories, whatever one may  think about its motives or its future, has added a new and  complicated element to the already complex cluster of  issues at the centre of the Arab/Israel dispute. '

3

The Australian Government has watched with concern the  increasing.  levels of violence, including loss of life.,.Â·  injury and destruction of property. .  We recognise that the  Israel Defence Force faces a difficult situation for which,  especially in the early days of the unrest, it was ill  prepared.  Yet the Australian Government cannot condone the

arbitrary measures being used by Israel to contain the  unrest.  In particular we have condemned practices such as  the use of live ammunition against Palestinian

demonstrators.

At the UN this year Australia voted in favour of a

resolution which drew attention to Israeli practices in the  Occupied Territories.  We did so because we were and remain  genuinely concerned at the erosion of human rights  standards in the Occupied Territories. It gave us no

pleasure to vote against Israeli practices in this way, and  to find ourselves compelled to call on Israel to abide by  internationally recognised standards of behaviour.  And our  disappointment flowed from the fact that the Australian  community expects Israel to be true to its founding ideals  of justice and respect for human life and free politicial  expression. If in Israeli eyes we sometimes appear too  critical on these matters,  it is because we associate

Israel with high standards and democratic values.

The Australian Government believes that there can be no  resolution of the Arab/Israel conflict - of which the  uprising is only the most dramatic manifestation - until  the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people are  addressed, because in the final analysis peace and justice  for Israel will only be found when there is also peace and  justice for the Palestinians. The Palestinian people, in  our view, should have the right of self determination,

including the right,  if they so choose, to independence and  the possibility of establishing their own independent state  - although a substantial view within supporters of the  Palestinian cause remains that the most likely ultimate  outcome would be a form of confederation with Jordan.

4

Now I do not pretend that such formulations can of

themselves bring peace to the region. A negotiated peace  reguires political will, flexibility and changes in current  policies and practices, because whatever arrangements are  finally settled will have to depend on decisions involving  the participation and agreement of all parties. No one

actor or coalition of actors can impose a peace.

But if peace must necessarily wait for all parties to be  ready to negotiate with each other- , it cannot wait  forever.  Time is running out.

In particular, in Israel the demographic clock is ticking.  Palestinian birth rates are much higher than that of the  Jewish population. There are already 750,000 Arabs living  inside the pre-1967 borders of Israel.  A further 1.3  million Arabs live in the Occupied Territories and the  demographic projections suggest that Israel faces the  prospect of an eventual Arab majority, if it maintains  control of the occupied territories.  And Arabs who live  within the present borders of the State of Israel are

identifying more and more with the aspirations behind the  current uprising. What will this mean for both the

Jewishness of the Israeli state and its democratic  traditions?

So Israel faces some difficult choices. It can try to keep  a lid on the Palestinian uprising, hoping to ride out the  storm. This will place even greater demands on the Israeli  defence forces and further strains on the values which have

so far underpinned Israeli society.

Alternatively Israel can opt for a territorial compromise

which goes at least part of the way towards meeting the

aspirations of the Palestinians, and perhaps containing an

increasingly restive and militant Palestinian population.

This approach lay at the centre of Secretary Shultz's

unsuccessful efforts earlier this year to review the peace

process.  It is also a crucial element of UN Security

Council resolution 242 which Australia strongly supports.

The outcome of the Israeli elections makes it very, clear  that, unhappily, Israel has yet to find a domestic

consensus on how to approach the peace process. The election result revealed a nation divided. At one end are  the views of leaders like Abba Eban and commentators like  the former head of Israeli military intelligence Yehoshafat  Harkabi who counsel compromise and negotiation. At the

other, are the increasingly extreme voices who advocate the  expulsion of the Palestinians from the Occupied Territories  - a path which in my view would be quite disastrous for  Israel and for peace. And in the the middle are probably

the great majority of Israelis who want peace but are also  deeply concerned to remove once and for all what they  perceive as direct threats to their security.

One can only hope that Israel - and the other parties -  come to see that time is indeed running out,  and that a  negotiated peace is a means of strengthening not abandoning  national security. Ultimately, the securing of any stable

international peace must rest on a commitment to joint  survival, whereby each side achieves security not against  adversaries, but with them: that is the essence of the concept of Common Security, so well articulated by the  Palme Commission on Disarmament and Security Issues in the  early 1980s,  and it has as much application to regional as

to global conflict.

In military terms, Israel currently holds a pre-eminent  position in the region. Its armed forces are better  trained, better equipped and better managed than any of its  neighbours.  But it is difficult to believe that the march  of technology won't eventually change the terms of the  military equation in the Middle East.  Already the spread

of ballistic missile and chemical weapons capabilities -  and their actual use in the Gulf War - have raised

questions about whether military hardware can guarantee

national defence.  These trends do not necessarily  completely change the game.  But they do suggest that

6

national security and certainly national prosperity .  may

require more than buffer zones and military hardware to be  protected. In this sense developments in military  technologies and capabilities serve to reinforce the  argument that it is in the interest of all parties to find  a negotiated settlement to the Arab/Israel conflict.

In focusing on the choices that face Israel I am not

suggesting that if only Israel changed its policies peace  would come to the Middle East. After all, Israel lives in  a region where most- of its neighbours do not even formally  recognise its..existence. And to negotiate you need, a

partner who is willing to sit with you at the table and  tackle the tough issues. Several of the Arab parties to  the conflict have not yet been prepared to do this.

But there are encouraging signs that this is changing. The  recent resolutions of the Palestine National Council in  Algiers represented in my view potentially significant  steps in the right direction. They certainly do not go far

enough and in crucial areas they were not explicit enough,  as I made clear in reacting to them on behalf of the

Government. The Council's acceptance of UN Security  Council Resolution 242 as the basis of an international  conference on the Middle East fell short of an absolutely  unequivocal statement of Israel's right to exist to the  extent that it was, in effect, conditional upon the holding  of a conference and the acceptance of other resolutions as  well.

Again, although there appeared at first sight to be an  explicit rejection of the "threat or use of force, violence  and terrorism .... against the territorial integrity of  other states", there is legitimate concern that the

accompanying exception made for "the mutual right to defend

[Palestine's] territorial integrity and independence" does  not comprehensively rule out the use of terrorism in

pursuit of the Palestinians' political objectives.

7

But now we do have the statement released in Stockholm on 7  December after a recent meeting between the PLO Chairman  and a number of American Jewish figures of varying degrees  of prominence in which Arafat associates himself with a

rather tighter interpretation of the PNC declaration, and

one which seems likely to be greeted favourably by a large  number of Western countries. To appreciate that point,;  I  think it is necessary to set out the relevant parts of the

statement in full:

The following explanation was given by the

representatives of the PLO of certain important points  in the Palestinian Declaration of Independence and the  political statement adopted by the PNC in Algiers.

Affirming the principle incorporated in those UN  resolutions which call for a two-state solution of  Israel and Palestine,

The PNC:

1. Agreed to enter into peace negotiations at an  international conference under the auspices of the  UN with the participation of the permanent members  of the Security Council and the PLO as the sole

legitimate representative of the Palestinian people,  on an equal footing with the other parties to the  conflict. Such an international conference is to be  held on the basis of UN resolutions 242 and 338 and

the right of the Palestinian people to

self-determination, without external interference,  as provided in the UN charter, including the right  to an independent state, which conference should  resolve the Palestinian problem in all its aspects.

2. Established the independent State of Palestine and  accepted the existence of Israel as a state in the  region.

3. Declared its rejection and condemnation of terrorism  in all its forms, including state terrorism.

4. Called for a solution to the Palestinian refugee  problem in accordance with international law and  practices and relevant UN resolutions (including  right of return or compensation).

8

It is difficult to argue that that statement, in paragraphs  2 and 3, does not go further, with less qualification, than  anything that has previously been said, and would seem to  justify, as a result, a rather more positive response than  the reflex negatives that have emerged from Israel so far.   What matters,  of cause, is the representative status of

that statement, and whether it will hold up as the

unambiguous position of the PLO as a whole. In this

respect, the UN meeting in Geneva next week will offer an  opportunity to put the Arafat statement in a more

authoritative way, and we will be watching with very close

interest to see what is there said.

Even if, for the moment, the PNC resolutions remain the  official text, and the Arafat statement just a gloss, it is  important to recognise that those PNC resolutions do  represent the most forthright and flexible position yet  demonstrated by the PLO. One can only hope that this will

be recognised and that the resolutions could evolve further  and set in train the development of much needed confidence  building measures.  As I have earlier argued, I think it  would be in Israel’s interests to respond positively to the

PNC resolutions - not to say that the resolutions solve all  the problems or meet all the necessary conditions: they do  not - but to encourage the less hardline elements within  the Palestinian leadership in a way that could help bring  about direct negotiations.

Now I recognise that Australia is a long way from the  Middle East. There are some people who argue that on  issues which directly concern the national survival of  Israel no public advice should be offered by outsiders

because it will be Israelis and not the outsiders who will  have to live with the consequences. Well Australia has no  intention of telling Israel what it must do. But as I said  earlier the responsibilities of friendship oblige us to

speak frankly, and we all have an interest in seeing that

peace comes to the Middle East. We are not a party

principal but I would like to think that we are sensitive

to the issues,  and we have endorsed clearly defined

principles which we believe contain the elements of a  peaceful and enduring solution.

Matters of war and peace are of concern to all responsible  international citizens, especially in these days of nuclear  weapons. I know that Australian Jewry wants to see, and is  working for, peace in the Middle East.  You have made an

important contribution to the development of relations  between Australia and Israel and anyone who visits Israel  cannot but notice the extensive involvement of Australian  Jewry in Israel's educational, cultural and economic life.  You are properly and understandably firm supporters of

Israel.  All of this gives you an opportunity to contribute  to the debate which is taking place in Israel and elsewhere  on how best to pursue the cause of peace; to change the  course of this damaging and ultimately disastrous  confrontation between Jews and Arabs.

For my generation, a generation born around the time of

Israel's birth, the founding of the state of Israel  represented not only the redressing of a shameful wrong.   It also carried with it great hopes about the establishment  and nurturing of a liberal democratic nation. It was a  moment when idealism found practical expression. And at a

time when all the parties to the Middle East dispute face  crucial decisions, I urge you all to use your influence and  to work with others to ensure that this idealism and sense  of justice which drove the move to establish Israel and  made Israel a "light unto the world" remain the inspiration

for future Iraeli actions and policies.
