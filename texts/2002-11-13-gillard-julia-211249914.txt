HOWARD GOVERNMENT FORCED BY LABOR  TO ACT ON CHILDREN IN DETENTION

On Australia Day 2002, Labor called upon the Howard Government to work with Labor to get children out from behind the razor wire of high security detention facilities.

In February we called for the closure of Woomera detention centre.

In Parliament we moved an amendment to the Migration Act to compel the Government to get children out from behind the razor wire.

Labor’s amendment ensures: Ã¢ÂÂ¢ That unaccompanied children are placed into foster or community care arrangements; and Ã¢ÂÂ¢ That families with children will be allowed to live in accommodation like the

Woomera alternate detention trial after meeting certain criteria.

The amendment is designed to meet the needs of children without endangering the health and security of Australians.  Labor has specifically drafted the amendment with this balance in mind.

Under pressure from Labor, it seems Minister Ruddock is now planning to act.

We call on Minister Ruddock to make a full statement and tell us whether he is adopting Labor’s plans in whole or in part.

We promised at the beginning of this year that Labor would be tough on border protection and compassionate on asylum seekers.

Perhaps the Government is beginning to see the sense of our position also.
