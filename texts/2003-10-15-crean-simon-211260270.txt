Prime Minister refuses to show compassion to Bali Victims

The Prime Minister must act on his promise of compassion to the victims of  the Bali bombing by allowing two children who lost their mother in the  bombing to visit their father in an Australian detention centre.

Mr Howard today failed to act on Labor’s call for a visa to allow the children  (aged 4 and 8) who have been stuck in Bali for over 12 months since their  Indonesian mother died, to come and visit their father who is detained in the  Baxter Detention Centre.

This is despite the Prime Minister’s statement in the Parliament the week  before, saying that the 2002 bombings in Bali would:

"....... be remembered as a day when Australians displayed remarkable  courage, remarkable s rength, remarkable compassion and remarkable  affection to those who had been so badly injured and so badly hurt."

.

t



A sign of this compassion would be for the Prime Minister to allow these  children to visit their Dad.

Failing to do this is downright mean and heartless.

Minister Vanstone also ruled out using her powers to grant these children  access to their father, despite the extraordinary circumstances of this case.

The Howard Government continues to show that it cannot grasp the concept  of compassion when it comes to asylum seekers.

Whilst we have a Prime Minister prepared to leave distressed children in a  foreign country, unable to visit their father, and a Minister for Immigration  prepared to keep children behind razor wire this Government’s talk of  compassion will continue to be exposed as nothing more than empty rhetoric.
