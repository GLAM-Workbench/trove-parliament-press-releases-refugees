INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT AGREES AUSTRALIA’S TREATMENT OF   ASYLUM SEEKERS BREACHES INTERNATIONAL LAW



Independent Member for Clark, Andrew Wilkie, will hold a press conference today to discuss the  International Criminal Court’s response, received yesterday, to his referral that the Australian  Government’s treatment of asylum seekers is a crime against humanity.

WHEN: 12:15pm TODAY 14 February 2020  WHERE: Parliament Lawns HOBART

The ICC in The Hague makes it clear that Australia is in breach of Article 7(1)(e) of the Rome  Statute because the conditions on Nauru and Manus Island do, and have always, constituted  cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment. The findings of the ICC are consistent with many other  reports including those by the Australian Human Rights Commission, the United Nations and  Amnesty International.

In their letter, the ICC confirmed that “in terms of the conditions of detention and treatment,  although the situation varied over time, the Office considers that some of the conduct at the  processing centres on Nauru and on Manus Island appears to constitute the underlying act of  imprisonment or other severe deprivations of physical liberty under article 7(1)(e) of the  Statute.”

“The ICC’s response is a remarkable condemnation of the cruelty of the Australian  Government’s asylum seeker policies,” Mr Wilkie said. “We’ve long known that the  Government’s response to asylum seekers has been barbaric, inhumane and expensive, but now  there can be no doubt that it also puts Australia in breach of the Rome Statute and guilty of  crimes against humanity.

“Although the ICC advised me that a number of matters I referred were beyond the Court’s  jurisdiction, recent developments in the Government’s asylum seeker policies have opened up  new avenues for further investigation and I am currently seeking legal advice as to the next step

forward.

“I first complained to the ICC in January 2015 and have been sending the Prosecutor evidence  ever since, including allegations of cash payments being made to members of Indonesian people  smuggling rings by Australian intelligence officials; the indefinite detention of children; forced  family separation; the forced release of asylum seekers into the foreign sovereign nation of the  Republic of Nauru; the treatment of unaccompanied refugee minors; the contents of the so-called  Nauru files comprising of reports of assaults, sexual abuse, self-harm attempts, child abuse and  ongoing trauma endured by asylum seekers held by the Australian Government in Nauru; the  legislated life time ban of refugees who arrived by boat from Australia; and other discriminatory  migration laws.”

Prominent human rights lawyer Greg Barns welcomed the response. “When Andrew Wilkie  wrote to the ICC five years ago he did so to make it aware of the cruelty of the offshore detention  regime,” Mr Barns said. “It is clear that the Rome Statute has been breached by Australia. It is  extraordinary and shameful that a nation which purports to believe in the rule of law should be  found to be in breach of the international law which outlaws cruelty and inhumanity.”

“This appears to be the first time that the ICC has taken Australia to task for Rome Statute  breaches,” Mr Wilkie said.

Dear Madam,



On behalf of the Prosecutor, I thank you again for your communication received on 29 June 2017, as  well as any subsequent related information.

In our letter of 6 December 2018, we informed you that the Office of the Prosecutor (“Office”) was

carrying out an analysis of the allegations in your communicati on, based, inter alia, on the

information you provided. The purpose of this analysis was to assess whether on the basis of the

information available, the alleged crimes appear to fall within the jurisdiction of the International

Criminal Court (“ICC” or “Court”) and therefore warrant the opening of a preliminary examination

into the situation at hand.



Following this evaluation, the Office would like to inform you that the matters described in your

communication do not appear to fall within the jurisdictio n of the Court.



As you are aware, the ICC is entrusted with a very specific and carefully defined jurisdiction under

the Rome Statute (“Statute”). The Court may only exercise jurisdiction over crimes committed on the

territory or by nationals of States Parties, after the entry into force of the Rome Statute, on 1 July

2002 or following the entry into force of the Statute for the State Party concerned. This jurisdictional

regime can only be otherwise extended where a non-Party State lodges an ad hoc declaration

accepting the exercise of jurisdiction by the Court with respect to crimes committed on its territory

and by its nationals, or where the United Nations Security Council refers a situation to the

Prosecutor acting under Chapter VII of the UN Charter. The Court’s subject-matter jurisdiction is

limited to the most serious crimes of concern to the international community as a whole, namely:

genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and the crime of aggression. To be admissible,

relevant cases must be grave enough to justify action by the Court and must satisfy the

complementarity principle, as set out in article 17 of the Statute.



Your communication alleges that crimes against humanity may have been committed by the

Australian government against migrants or asylum seekers arriving by boat who were interdicted at

sea (either in Australia’s territorial waters or international waters), transferred to offshore

processing centres in Nauru and Manus Island, and detained there for prolonged periods under

inhuman conditions from 2001 to the present day. It is further alleged that these acts were

committed jointly with, or with the assistance of, the governments of Nauru and Papua New Guinea,

as well as private entities contracted by the Australian government t o operate the centres of the

islands.



In assessing the allegations received, as is required by the Statute, the Office examined several forms

of alleged or otherwise reported conduct and considered the possible legal qualifications under

article 7 of the Statute.



In terms of the conditions of detention and treatment, although the situation varied over time, the

Office considers that some of the conduct at the processing centres on Nauru and on Manus Island

appears to constitute the underlying act of imprisonment or other severe deprivations of physical

liberty under article 7(1)(e) of the Statute. 1 The information available indicates in this regard that

migrants and asylum seekers living on Nauru and Manus Island were detained on average for

upwards of one year in unhygienic, overcrowded tents or other primitive structures while suffering

from heatstroke resulting from a lack of shelter from the sun and stifling heat. These conditions also

reportedly caused other health problems—such as digestive, musculoskeletal, and skin conditions

among others—which were apparently exacerbated by the limited access to adequate medical care. It

appears that these conditions were further aggravated by an environment rife with sporadic acts of

physical and sexual violence committed by staff at the facilities and members of the local

population. The duration and conditions of detention caused migrants and asylum seekers —

including children — measurably severe mental suffering, including by experiencing anxiety and

depression that led many to engage in acts of suicide, attempted suicide, and other forms of self -harm, without adequate mental health care provided to assist in alleviating their suffering.



These conditions of detention appear to have constituted cruel, inhuman,  or degrading treatment

(“CIDT”), and the gravity of the alleged conduct thus appears to have been such that it was in

violation of fundamental rules of international law. This conclusion - including regarding the

relevance of victims being subjected to CIDT - is consistent with jurisprudence from other

international courts and tribunals and human rights supervisory bodies regarding the level of

severity required to establish a deprivation of liberty that falls within the intended scope of the

crime provided under article 7(1)(e).



The Office’s characterisation of detentions - including with respect to their duration and the

conditions to which migrants and asylum seekers were subjected - are also largely consistent with

the assessments made by various UN bodies, human rights organisations, and, in part, certain

domestic inquiries in Australia. Overall, taking into account the duration, the extent, and the



1 This is without prejudice to an assessment of the required contextual elements, which is discussed separately

below. In this context, the Office notes that it appears that once the facilities on Nauru and Manus Island were  converted into “open centres” as of October 2015 and May 2016, respectively, the migrants and asylum seekers  can no longer be considered, under the particular circumstances presented, to have been severely deprived of  their physical liberty, as required by article 7(1)(e) of the Statute.

conditions of detention, the alleged detentions in question appear to have been of sufficient severity

to constitute the crime of imprisonment or other severe deprivation of physical liberty under article

7(1)(e) of the Statute. By contrast, based on the information available, it does not appear that the

conditions of detention or treatment were of a severity to be appropriately qualified as the crime

against humanity of torture under article 7(1)(f) of the Statute, or of a nature and gravity to be

qualified as the crime against humanity of other inhumane acts under article 7(1)(k) of the Statute.



With respect to the alleged acts of deportation under article 7(1)(d) of the Statute, it does not appear

that Australia’s interdiction and transfer of migrants and asylum seekers arriving by boat to third

countries meets the required statutory criteria to constitute crimes against humanity. In this respect,

the Office’s analysis of whether the transfer of migrants and asylum seekers amounts to deportation

has focussed primarily on whether the persons in question - intercepted either in international

waters or in Australia’s territorial waters - could have been considered ‘lawfully present’ in the area

from which they were displaced. In this context, the Office considered both relevant domestic

legislation as well as applicable international law standards, with due regard also for international

refugee law, human rights standards more broadly, and various principles enshrined in the UN

Convention on the Law of the Sea, such as those concerning freedom of navigation in the high seas

and the right of innocent passage.



Ultimately, however, the Office was not satisfied that there was a basis to conclude that the migrants

or asylum seekers were lawfully present in the area(s) from which they were deported, within the

scope and meaning of this element of the crime of deportation under the Statute. In this respect, for

example, the Office considers that while the removal of migrants or asylum seekers to territories

where they would be subjected to CIDT would engage a State’s human rights obligations, this does

not affect the distinct legal question of whether the persons to be so removed were ‘lawfully present’

for the purpose of international criminal law and the crime of deportation . To consider otherwise

would render the question of lawful presence under that provision rela tive to, or dependent on, the

legality of a person’s subsequent treatment. Such a circular approach would arguably be the

opposite of the logic of the elements of the crime under article 7(1)(d), which seeks to ensure that

only if persons are lawfully present are they protected from deportation or forcible transfer without

grounds permitted under international law.



Finally, with respect to the crime against humanity of persecution under article 7(1)(h) committed in

connection with other prohibited acts under the Statute, the Office considers that the above

identified conduct of imprisonment or severe deprivation of liberty does not appear to have been

committed on discriminatory grounds.



With respect to remaining alleged or otherwise reported relevant co nduct, based on the information

available, it did not appear to the Office that any other acts constituted crimes within the jurisdiction

of the Court.



Bearing in mind the Office’s finding with respect to imprisonment or other severe deprivations of

physical liberty under article 7(1)(e), the Office proceeded to assess whether the requisite contextual

elements were also met since, notably, the identified conduct was committed in the context of



Page: 4 / 4



Australia’s offshore detention and processing of migrants in N auru and Papua New Guinea, which

was carried out and pursued as part of border control policies adopted by successive governments.



Having assessed the information available, there is insufficient information at this stage to indicate

that the multiple acts of imprisonment or severe deprivation of liberty were committed pursuant to

or in furtherance of a State (or organisational) policy to commit an attack against migrants or asylum

seekers seeking to enter Australia by sea, as required by article 7(2)(a) of the Statute. Specifically, the

information available at this stage does not provide sufficient support for finding that the failure on

the part of the Australian authorities under successive governments, whose policies varied over

time, to take adequate measures to address the conditions of the detentions and treatment of

migrants and asylum seekers seeking to enter Australia by sea, or to stop further transfers, was

deliberately aimed at encouraging an ‘attack’, within the meaning of article 7. In this context,

although Australia’s offshore processing and detention programmes were initiated to pursue, among

other things, a policy of immigration deterrence, as confirmed by official announcements and

statements, the information available at this stage does  not support a finding that cruel, inhuman, or

degrading treatment was a deliberate, or purposefully designed, aspect of this policy.



The Office could not otherwise establish a State or organisational policy to commit the acts described

by the governments of Nauru and Papua New Guinea or other private actors.  As such, based on the

information available, the crimes allegedly committed by the Australian authorities, jointly with, or

with the assistance of, the governments of Nauru and Papua New Guinea, and private actors, as set

out in the communication, do not appear to satisfy the contextual elements of crimes against

humanity under article 7 of the Statute.



Accordingly, the Prosecutor has determined that there is no basis to proceed at this time.

Nonetheless, consistent with article 15(6) of the Statute and rule 49(2) of the Rules of Procedure and

Evidence, this decision may be reconsidered in the light of new facts or  information.



I am grateful for your interest in the ICC. I hope you will appreciate t hat with the defined

jurisdiction of the Court, many allegations will be beyond the reach of this institution. In this regard,

please also note that the ICC is designed to complement, not replace national jurisdictions. Thus,

you may wish to raise your concerns with other appropriate national or international authorities.



Yours sincerely,







Phakiso Mochochoko
