ADDRESS BY HIS EXCELLENCY MAJOR GENERAL MICHAEL JEFFERY AC CVO MC

GOVERNOR-GENERAL OF THE COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA

ON THE OCCASION OF

OPENING OF THE NATIONAL HEADQUARTERS BUILDING THE INSTITUTION OF ENGINEERS, AUSTRALIA NATIONAL CIRCUIT, BARTON, ACT

13 OCTOBER 2004

Mr Doug Jones, National President, Engineers Australia Past National Presidents Councillors Distinguished guests Ladies and gentlemen

I am delighted to have this opportunity to support the Institution of Engineers Australia, and as Patron to affirm the  profession’s influential role in the development of Australia.

During the next few minutes, I want to illustrate the contribution and place of engineers in society - the striving for  excellence in all they do - in seeking innovative solutions to simple and complex challenges - being responsive to the  needs of the Australian and international communities.

The American, Gordon Brown, a leader in the modernisation of engineering, was an astute observer. He wrote that:  “Engineering is not merely knowing and being knowledgeable, like a walking encyclopaedia; engineering is not  merely analysis; engineering is not merely the possession of the capacity to get elegant solutions to non-existent  engineering problems; engineering is practicing the art of the organized forcing of technological change... Engineers  operate at the interface between science and society.”

So where is that connection in Australia? There are thousands of examples, and I want to mention several that echo  Brown’s view.

Ladies and gentlemen. When Governor Arthur Phillip set foot on Farm Cove to begin the task of nation-building, the  importance of engineering was recognised immediately with the development of the colony’s first water supply in a  stream draining an area of less than 73 hectares on the western slopes of what is now Hyde Park. Three large tanks  were excavated from the sandstone bed and were used to collect sufficient water to enable survival through a long and  severe drought.

Despite all that has occurred during its life, the Tank Stream, fed by underground springs, still flows today, symbolic  of its great historical and engineering significance. This was probably the first conscious example of European water  technology in Australia.

But of course for many thousands of years before that, indigenous Australians were successfully employing hydraulics  to harvest food. In western New South Wales and western Victoria, complex systems of stone weirs channelled  streams and rivers into specially designed stone fish traps.

Aborigines employed detailed knowledge of tides and the rise and fall of river levels. Their stone enclosures were  designed to ensure maximum catch of the desired species, the traps under constant monitoring, repair and redesign to  ensure the efficient harvest of marine life for families’ needs. That’s the powerful image of the engineering of  necessity and its relationship to the land and the sea - understanding the rhythm of the environment.

Another remarkable example of engineering excellence is the boomerang. Similar throwing sticks were known to have  existed in ancient Egypt for killing birdlife directly, however the ‘Australian model’ was aerodynamically designed to  return. Nets were often draped between a clump of trees and as a flock of birds flew overhead the boomerangs would  be thrown over the top of the birds. The boomerangs were directed in such a way that they would hover over the birds,  as a hawk would, the birds would panic and swoop down into the nets.

What I draw from these ancient examples are recurring themes of genius in simplicity, of resourceful, inventive people  exploring possibilities and creating solutions. And this is the philosophy that I see underpinning the engineering  profession in 2004.

Engineering is not simply about the application of science in order to construct things - though that’s an essential.  Ultimately, engineering is about people and how we can improve their amenity so they can live prosperous and  fulfilling lives.

As a boy at school, I was always enthralled by what engineers did, and the stories told of the glorious history of the  great pioneer engineers - their dams, bridges, railways, tunnels, harbours and numerous public works.

Throughout history we have seen how technology has influenced the course of revolutions in agriculture,  manufacturing, sanitation, medicine, warfare, transportation, information processing and communication, all of which  have an engineering dimension.

Australia has benefited over the years from its high-quality engineering.

For example, hydro-power systems in the Snowy Mountains and Tasmania have been leaders in the use of renewable  energy sources.

That magnificent engineer, C.Y. O’Connor, built the Perth-Kalgoorlie water pipeline, revolutionising life in the  Goldfields. A life-size bronze statue of O’Connor is located in a commanding position at Victoria Quay overlooking  one of his other great projects, Fremantle Harbour.

During my military career, I was closely associated with army engineers (the sappers) who worked hard and  incessantly, both in and out of action, “delousing” mines, blowing wire, demolishing bridges and repairing others,  fixing roads, and performing a hundred other hazardous and somewhat energetic chores.

Away from battle, there was no respite for the sapper. In a quiet area, roads always required repair, an airfield built or a  water point constructed.

Their bulldozers were never quiet.

In Vietnam, engineers did much to improve the living conditions of the South Vietnamese people of Phuoc Tuy  Province - ranging from classroom construction to the establishment of a concrete products industry at Long Tan.

Villagers were provided with technical advice, labour assistance and materials as part of the Vietnamese Village Self  Development Plan.

In 1969, the same year your national headquarters building was opened, a joint venture at Baria Hospital saw kitchens,  dining rooms, toilets and showers, a water supply, a sewerage system, road works and landscaping completed.

Australian assistance took many forms - buildings, community centres, sporting facilities, village offices, the provision  of electricity, and improved agriculture and better medical and dental-care facilities.

Thus even in a war situation, our engineers continued their traditional role of building enduring futures for people.

In Northern Australia, the Corps of Royal Australian Engineers are actively participating in the development of remote  regions - supporting indigenous communities by constructing sewerage facilities and other infrastructure projects.

Ladies and gentlemen. In the great centre of Australia the completion of the Alice Springs-to-Darwin railway will  provide the opportunity for Australia to supply almost anything into South East Asia quickly and effectively, and has  the potential to make Darwin a major sea, air, road and rail transport hub as an important gateway to Australia.

Similarly, Australia’s vast, well-designed and well-constructed 816,000-kilometre network of roads open for general  traffic to transport people and goods, is a vital component to a vibrant economy and our competitive viability in export  markets.

Science and engineering, conjoined, have the ability to deliver great benefits for society. Examples include:

Ã¢ÂÂ     clever clean-up processes for the human body (nanomachines that attack cancers); and

Ã¢ÂÂ     toxin eaters and water purifiers for our ecosystems.

Importantly, engineering has allowed Australians to take their knowledge, expertise and skills to the wider world with  such projects as the Mekong River Friendship Bridge between Laos and Thailand, the My Thuan Bridge linking  Vietnam and Laos, Hong Kong’s international airport, the 2004 Olympic stadiums in Athens, the Virgin Atlantic  service facility in London, the Singapore Exhibition and Convention Centre, Wembley Stadium and the re-establishment of essential infrastructure in East Timor and Iraq.

Australia enjoys a global reputation in engineering competency assessment and accreditation, with exports of  engineering services growing at an average annual rate of almost 15 per cent for almost a decade.

Many Australian engineers are undertaking aid work in under-developed countries and offering humanitarian relief.

For example, the work of the Registered Engineers for Disaster Relief (RedR Australia), as part of a global endeavour,  offers Australian engineers the opportunity to directly improve the lives of many people around the world.

Since 1992, RedR Australia has principally worked for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, funded  by the Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID), under a continuing program of assistance to the  world’s refugee population.

Australian RedR volunteers provide vital services such as safe drinking water, sanitation, power, roads and bridges in  Afghanistan, East Timor, Iraq, Jordan and Mozambique.

Ladies and gentlemen.

The world is changing at a breathtaking pace. As we hurtle into the 21st century, our lives are increasingly influenced  by sophisticated and complex technologies. They have changed our institutions. They have made our world smaller,  yet given us the tools to think well beyond our own horizons, enabling us to engage with minute precision on projects  of grand proportions.

The level of engineering knowledge and skills needed for the world to flourish is growing at an accelerating rate,  making life-long learning an exciting fact of life.

Within this context, engineers have an increasing responsibility to create a safe, innovative and environmentally  friendly society. As members of the world’s largest and most dynamic profession during the most significant era in the  history of technology, engineers will be a key driving force in shaping society. Indeed the synergy of engineering and  science, business, finance and politics has changed the world.

The future of engineering lies not only within the great legacy of engineering success we’ve enjoyed up to today, but  also, and very importantly, in the recruiting and training of the engineers of tomorrow. This includes educating and  mentoring young Australians, along with encouraging more young women to take up engineering - (presently they  represent only about 14 per cent of the overall engineering student population).

In thinking of young Australians and how to encourage them to your profession in greater numbers, I believe in getting  in early in secondary education, promoting the study of mathematics and science - demonstrating that your profession  is relevant, that it practices in a range of settings and interdisciplinary approaches that offer the diversity and ‘edge’  that many young people are seeking.

It is sobering to consider that of the OECD countries, Australia rates in the lower order of engineers per head of  population. There are roughly half as many engineers graduating from our tertiary institutions as there are scientists, at  a time when we need people who convert ideas into products, processes and infrastructure, as much as we need those  who do pure and applied research.

One of the keys is fostering creativity - matching an individual’s values and priorities to those of your profession.

Another of the keys is mentoring; enlisting the participation of engineer ‘grandparent equivalents’ (often retirees) who  would expose young students to the enduring satisfaction of an engineering career. I strongly support mentoring  programs for male and female students, using these opportunities to transform lives; stimulating individuals to self-assess and reflect in becoming more conscious learners; wiser heads acting as sounding boards for problem solving.

There are marvellous opportunities ahead for Engineers Australia. I am confident in your capacity to manage the future  because of what you have accomplished so convincingly in the past.

Mr President, I commend you and your executive on these new national headquarters. They symbolise rightly, an  optimistic approach for the future. I wish the Institution, and the 75,000 members it represents, the continuing success  they deserve.

As Patron of the Institution of Engineers Australia, it is now my very great pleasure to declare the National  Headquarters officially open.
