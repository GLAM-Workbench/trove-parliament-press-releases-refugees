PRESS RELEASE

FROM MOSS CASS, SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND ETHNIC AFFAIRS

REFUGEES ATTEMPT SUICIDE IN SOUTH AUSTRALIA.

"Some 40 refugees have attempted suicide since their arrival in

Adelaide. Unfortunately, last week, one of them has been successful. .

This disconcerting information was given to me yesterday by .

Mr Bill Scetrine, State Director of "Austcare" in South Australia," Ã¢ÂÂ

said Dr Cass, Shadow Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs.

"Apparently those Indo-Chinese refugees who attempted suicide complained

that they receive little or no information to help them to settle

in South Australia, no information about their home land and most

of all because they hold little hope in reuniting with their families

still living in Vietnam and in refugee camps. They also complained

because they can't be sure that things sent from Australia to

Vietnam to help their families would ever reach their destination,"

Dr Cass said. "Finding suitable employment in South Australia was

just another problem."

"An even more frightening situation seems to developing in South

Australia.. Refugees who have risked their lives to escape from

Vietnam and Kambodia are apparently receiving threatening phone

calls and bomb threats in Adelaide. Indeed, even officials working

with refugees are constantly harassed and threatened. I don't

know whether the situation is the same in other States, but these

threats are certainly to be deplored," Dr Cass said.
