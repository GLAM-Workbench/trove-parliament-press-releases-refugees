in the field of national health and welfare statistics and in analysing 
public health trends. It has thrived under Professor Reid’s guidance 
and that of its present Director, Dr Richard Madden.

I’m looking forward to continuing to work with the Institute and its 
staff in their critical role in the development of health and welfare
