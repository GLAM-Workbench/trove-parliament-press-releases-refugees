RAAF ASSISTANCE TO PAPUA NEW GUINEA

RAAF Chinook helicopters involved in training in Papua New

Guinea will transport building materials for a new settlement

for border-crossers at East Awin, in PNG's Western Province.

The task is to be carried out,at the request of the PNG.

Government and the United Nations High Commissioner for

Refugees.  Â·

The PNG Government announced late last year that it would move

the Irian Jaya border-crossers from their present temporary

camps.

The materials will be moved from a former mine construction camp

at Ningerum in Western Province. Rough terrain in the area

would make road or river transport of the material slow and

difficult.

The task, which involves nearly 70 tonnes of freight, is

expected to take about 25 hours of flying time of the two

Chinooks which have been on deployment from RAAF Base Amberley

for training in PNG since November 19.

practicable,  also meet PNG Government requests for transport

assistance during these deployments.
