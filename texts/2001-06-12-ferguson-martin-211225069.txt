Address - Australian Population Institute 'Vision of a Greater Australia' Breakfast, Melbourne - 12 June 2001

Check Against Delivery

Introduction

Ladies and Gentleman,

It is a pleasure to be here with you this morning.

I note the theme of this session is "A Vision for a Greater Australia".

It would be hard not to endorse such a theme, but I'd like to address a few things that must be incorporated in that notion.

"Freedom of choice, engagement, learning, adaptability, being open to new ideas, and playing a leadership role in our region, and in the world."

Where we don't agree on the vision, we need to be having a debate.

Where we do agree on the vision, we need to get down to the nitty-gritty of how we go about achieving it.

In either case, what I am suggesting is that the key to moving forward is facilitating a genuine public debate.

And it cannot be a public debate dominated by this interest or that - whether it is business, the environmental movement, or our politicians.

This debate must be informed, and it must give ordinary Australians a voice.

Population Debate

It seems like only yesterday that I was addressing a similar audience here in Melbourne about the need to have a genuine debate about population policy.

At the time, nearly 18 months ago, there was little public understanding of the population debate, and while there is still a long way to go, I am pleased to say that the debate has moved forward considerably.

It has moved forward because people such as Kim Beazley have shown the leadership that has been needed.

When Pauline Hanson first raised her loathsome agenda, just as the Howard Government was running and ducking for cover, it was Kim Beazley who had the courage to go out and argue for higher immigration.

When Labor said that we would establish an Office of Population to advise on the range of population options, the response of the Government at the time was, and I quote the Minister for Immigration, "there is no need for a formal population policy."

A Beazley Labor Government will commission this Office of Population to undertake a wide-ranging inquiry into alternative population scenarios.

Labor believes the Office of Population should play a key leadership role in encouraging a wider public understanding of population issues, and an open and honest debate.

The Office of Population will also examine ways to better coordinate State and Commonwealth efforts to settle skilled migrants in regional Australia, and improve the delivery of migrant family and community services.

Reflecting the importance Labor places on this issue, the Office will be located in the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet.

Labor's position has been consistent. We support a higher Australian population.

Players in the Debate

We all know that there are a variety of public opinions on population policy - and I note the constructive role many have chosen to play in the debate.

Those in business who are prepared to engage in a broad debate are to be commended, as are those in the environmental movement.

However, there are also those who simply refuse to engage, and believe they already have the answers.

In the end, the Australian community will side with people who are prepared to face up to alternative arguments, not those who have the most money behind them, or who simply want to scream the loudest.

While I do commend every small step forward the Immigration Minister has taken, I also note that the Prime Minister seems to want to turn back time.

A few weeks ago, I attended the National Farmers Federation Annual Dinner in Canberra.

The keynote address was by John Howard.

What struck me was that when you looked beyond the GST rhetoric, it was all about how we needed to protect our national borders, and how a Howard Government would never give in on so-called 'progressive' issues - such as reconciliation, the republic and immigration.

A sad aspect of the Prime Minister's contribution on this occasion was that his view of the future seemed to be stuck on taxation and industrial relations reform.

I think that our future should be about much more - an agenda of international openness, an agenda that sees our diversity as a strength, not a threat.

Our future needs to be based on the politics of hope, not the politics of fear.

Whether we maintain support for higher immigration will depend, in the end, on which path the Australian people choose.

Labor's Position

Labor believes that a larger population can culturally enrich us, assist us to achieve our economic objectives, help build our cities and regions, and help us to meet the new health and lifestyle challenges as our population ages.

But this is a debate that goes well beyond the size of our population.

A higher population is not sustainable without strong leadership, and it is not sustainable unless we maintain public confidence on immigration and population issues.

When Labor argued for a higher immigration intake, the Government refused to endorse it.

When Labor argued the need to link skilled migration with family reunion, the Government refused to endorse it.

When Labor argued that we needed a population policy, the Government explicitly opposed it.

I am pleased to say that we have moved on - and I commend the Minister for Immigration for at least engaging in the debate in more recent times.

Immigration

The Government typically runs the line that skilled migration produces greater benefits for our economy than family reunion or the humanitarian program.

Such an analysis surely misses the point.

Our past experience of immigration has shown us that people who commit to making new lives in Australia contribute a lot more to our nation than economic measures alone can capture.

Labor supported the shift in the skills mix of our immigration program. But an immigration program

must be balanced, and its objectives do go beyond the effects on our economy.

Our family reunion program recognises that we have an obligation to respect the people that become part of our nation, and their family circumstances.

Our humanitarian program recognises that we are still relatively lucky, and that we openly accept our moral obligations to fellow human beings when they face persecution and oppression in their native lands.

Furthermore, many of the benefits of immigration are indirect.

Immigration brings with it new perspectives, new ways of doing things and a greater understanding of different cultures and the way things are done in other parts of the world.

Immigration has contributed to creating a multicultural society, a society that has within it an inherent respect for people no matter where they come from.

It has changed how we see ourselves, and it has changed forever our place in the world.

When I was in Melbourne for our centenary celebrations, I was fortunate to be present for the comments that came from 15-year-old Sydney schoolgirl Hayley Eves during that event.

Before 7000 people in the Royal Exhibition Building - and before a massive live television audience -she had this to say:

I am young, I am a woman and I am Asian Australian. That I am standing in front of you demonstrates clearly that we have changed. Ã¢ÂÂÃ¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»

I believe more Australians were listening to what Hayley had to say that day - about a nation maturing -than are getting sucked into the politics of fear.

Hayley's message is that we have come a long way, and there is no turning back.

But we know there are tensions we are still struggling with.

If we are to maintain support for an agenda of hope rather than fear, we need to do more for the people and places currently missing out, and we need to listen to what people actually expect from government.

If we do these things, we have every chance of portraying our diversity as a key part of our national identity, rather than a threat to it.

Population Policy is about more than Immigration

Population policy is about more than immigration - it is also about issues of fertility; positive ageing; and labour force participation.

As with so many aspects of this debate, this too is something that the Government has only recently recognised.

Demographer Peter McDonald has noted that in the past 20 years, most industrialised nations have birth rates that are below the level that will reproduce their populations.

Australia's birth rate has fallen from an average of 3.6 children in 1961 to 1.75 in 1999 - well below the replacement rate of 2.1.

McDonald argues that the characteristics of market-based economies are making it difficult to arrest this decline.

Small government, low taxation, free trade and the free flow of capital, fewer restrictions on employers to determine wages and working conditions, and welfare cuts have rewarded innovation and hard work but failed to look after the casualties.

As McDonald says: when the welfare safety net is not guaranteed, people adopt risk-averse behaviour, and risk-averse can mean deciding not to have children.

Family-Friendly Policies

Our declining birth rates are in part due to our failure to help parents balance their work and family responsibilities.

While a minority of couples may not want children, many more couples who would otherwise choose to start a family are delaying that decision because they cannot balance work and financial commitments with caring for a child.

The contention that work has left little time for family life is not just a matter of perception - there is a wealth of evidence to suggest that Australian employees are now working longer and harder.

Governments have a responsibility to ensure people who want to start a family are supported to do so.

Countries that hold to 1950s ideals where men are breadwinners and women remain at home are not only out of touch with reality but are failing to confront one of the causes of falling birth rates.

In 50 years, these countries will suffer the social and economic consequences of having communities without kids.

At Labor's National Conference in August last year, Shadow Family and Community Services Minister Wayne Swan released a work and family policy blueprint to support families. This blueprint provides the foundation for our plan to tackle Australia's falling birth rate.

It means making a commitment to ensuring high quality and more affordable childcare.

It means ensuring childcare provides a forum for childhood development, particularly in disadvantaged communities.

It means committing to industrial relations strategies that strengthen the role of the Industrial Relations Commission and ensure families have more control in balancing their jobs and their parenting responsibilities.

Our families need a Government that is prepared to remove the barriers between welfare and work, to invest in the early years of their children's development, to better balance work and family, and ease the financial pressures families are under.

If we continue to pursue policies that are harmful to the wellbeing of families, we will pay a costly social

and economic price in 50 years.

We need to examine honestly whether families are given the genuine opportunities they need.

The Government should be supporting families who wish to have children by:

Ensuring access to affordable child care; Ã¢ÂÂÃ¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â» Providing a quality education for those who cannot attend expensive schools; and Ã¢ÂÂÃ¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â» Providing more support for families with young children. Ã¢ÂÂÃ¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»

On current rates, 26% of Australian women would remain childless at the end of their reproductive life.

For projected fertility, even the higher assumptions show an expected fertility rate of 1.75.

Labor's work and family policies, including assistance for families with young children, better support for education and more flexible industrial relations policies for workers with family responsibilities, are the only policies on offer to support Australia's working families.

Sustaining an Agenda for a Higher Population

We know that immigration has played an enormous part in developing our economy, our society and our culture.

But we also know that many people have doubts about immigration.

The key to the population debate is in maintaining the integrity of our immigration program, and in developing an agenda that better attends to the concerns and aspirations of all Australians.

The business community also still has some issues it has to face up to in this debate.

We are at a stage of the national debate when we have to move forward, and that demands that we look beyond our own patch and beyond our own immediate interests.

Unless we are all prepared to put our hands up in these debates, we will not win the confidence of ordinary Australians.

Business needs to recognise this - and start forging its role in the big debates about how we meet our environmental challenges, how we strengthen our democracy, and how we ensure that we develop our cities and regions sustainably.

Attracting People to the Regions

Australians are getting older, we are having less children but later in life, and we are moving away from the dry land regional areas to the coastal conurbations.

Our goal should be to create skilled people, competitive businesses and vibrant communities. Above all, we must develop a culture of learning - for individuals and for communities.

One gap in our immigration program is that it is failing to realise the potential benefits of migration to our regional areas.

Clearly, the future of regional migration does not lie with large-scale infrastructure projects such as the Snowy Mountains Hydro Scheme.

The future of regional migration must be far more closely in tune with the skill needs of regional areas, particularly our regional centres.

Recent arrivals are currently showing an increasing tendency to settle in major urban areas, particularly in Sydney and Melbourne - to be close to family, friends and services.

Attempts to attract migrants away from the big cities, such as state-sponsored and regional migration schemes, have been patchy and piecemeal at best.

My challenge to you today and to governments is to recognise that we must extend our thinking by creating new social and economic opportunities in regional Australia.

Modern Regional Cities

Skilled people, including skilled migrants, are critical to the future of our regional centres.

Under the Howard Government, regional Australia is about small, country towns and rural industries. This has left our regional centres, like Ballarat, Dubbo and Townsville without the support they need from their Federal Government.

Unfortunately, the attitude of the current government runs totally counter to international developments -which show that regional centres are where regional economies are moving forward.

Regional cities offer a lot of advantages for families - in terms of quality of life, safety and security. They are also big enough to offer a diversity of opportunities for a family.

Labor is examining ways to attract skilled migrants and businesses (and their families) to the regions not only to contribute to local economic development, but also to break down the misconceptions many people have about immigration.

Regional Migration Support

This is no small point, because it goes to the heart of the problem with the Howard Government's whole approach to regional development, which is to have no approach.

Just as regions aren't given the tools to help them create a regional vision, they aren't being given the resources to help employers on the ground.

Attracting migrants to our regions must be linked to the broader regional development agenda.

We are examining ways in which our regions can play a greater role in attracting migrants to particular areas according to their particular needs.

While skilled migration can contribute to our economic development, we cannot make the mistake of seeing it as a substitute for retraining our existing workforce.

Where it has been used for that purpose, such as in the building industry, it has undermined the public's

confidence in the integrity of the system.

Skilled migration is at times necessary to fill skills shortages, but only if our data on regional skill shortages is adequate.

I would also make the point that regional migration cannot be a substitute for retraining our existing workforce.

To make regional development work for us all, we must also be prepared to invest in the skills of those people who are being left behind.

Canada is conducting a trial to attract people to its provinces.

Under this trial, immigration becomes a shared responsibility between the Federal Government and provincial governments.

The Canadian Government commitment is through an agreement with the provinces to facilitate the co-ordination and implementation of immigration policies and programs.

Such a federal-provincial agreement outlines specific responsibilities and establishes formal mechanisms by which a province can contribute to the development of immigration policies and programs.

Quebec has pilotted a two-year project where the province nominates up to 150 individuals for migration based on skills and entrepreneurial ability.

The province is in a much better position to make these choices and it gives them a hands-on approach to targeting people to the area.

The Canada-Quebec accord is the most comprehensive of the agreements, enabling Canada and Quebec to manage this shared jurisdiction effectively and efficiently to meet their respective objectives.

The Canadian Government is committed to the provinces to the extent that they have formally enacted it in the immigration act to include the development with the interests of the provinces.

We can learn from the Canadian experience.

We need to take note about empowering our regions and for the Commonwealth to take a more co-ordinated approach to regional migration as opposed to leaving it up to the states as is the current ad hoc system.

Settlement Services

If we are serious about encouraging people to live in our regions, we must have a sustainable regional development agenda and a coordinated approach between the states and the Commonwealth to support people to settle.

In this respect, I note the comments of the Shadow Minister for Immigration, Con Sciacca, stressing the need for settlement and ethnic-based family and community services to be located where they are needed.

The problem with existing programs such as the state-specific scheme is that there is a lack of

coordination between the states and the Commonwealth about each region's needs.

Currently, Australia's regions have certifying bodies that are supposed to identify the skills needs of their area.

The Commonwealth in turn through its skills matching database is supposed to help regional employers or state and territory government agencies find people who have applied to migrate to Australia to fill specific skilled work vacancies.

But we have to ask ourselves how well the system is working.

One of its main problems relates to how employers use it in practice.

Since the Howard Government abandoned regional development in 1996, it is not at all clear where regional businesses go for assistance, whether it be in relation to migration or anything else.

There are a number of regional structures, and nobody on the ground seems to know what the respective bodies do.

In January this year, there were 42 certifying bodies covering South Australia, Tasmania, the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory, and most regional areas of the other States, but there are vast differences in how they operate and how they are resourced.

Some of these certifying bodies, which are sometimes offices of regional development, are doubtless doing a fine job. The anecdotal evidence is that others are having little impact in realising the skills needs of their regions.

Taking the Debate Forward

While it is not always possible to establish MRCs in regional cities, if you talk to people who work in settlement services, it is clear that there is scope to improve settlement services in our regions -community services, language services, better health and education.

The current pattern of settlement of refugees and migrants is into areas of high unemployment with few job prospects and a lack of services.

We know that a major influence on people settling in a country is the ability to get a job quickly and therefore provide economic and social independence for their families.

So settlement programs should be targetted to these areas where migrants can become participating members of the society as quickly as possible.

Non-profit groups, local government organisations, community groups educational institutions and business must be encouraged to work co-operatively to deliver better, more diverse and efficient settlement services.

These may include language training for adult migrants, orientation services, interpreting and translating services, referral to community resources and employment assistance.

Maintaining support for regional migration means linking with the broader regional development agenda - creating better settlement services combined with a proper investment in skilling people.

"Vision of a Greater Australia"

Ladies and Gentlemen,

Whether our nation chooses the politics of hope over the politics of fear does depend, to a great degree, on the quality of our vision.

But is also depends on our ability to gain people's respect.

Respect in public life and in public debate comes from honesty.

Public debate should not be mistaken for a popularity contest.

I believe in an agenda of openness, of free trade, of higher immigration, and of multilateral engagement with other nations.

But for those who agree with me, I note this point of caution: if you believe ideology will deliver that, think again.

Leadership today is as much about giving others a voice, as it is about providing your own vision.

When we lock ordinary Australians out of their own futures, we lose their trust. Labor's population agenda cannot be sustained unless we engage more effectively with ordinary Australians who feel like they are missing out.

We need to lead, and we need to listen. The only way to move forward is to move forward together.

It is important that we work on a vision for a greater Australia.

But a vision is nothing more than that until it puts bread and butter on the table. It is nothing more than that until it produces a change in the hearts and minds of Australians.

As a nation, we have had our ambition suppressed for the past five years, and the time for developing grand ideas is surely now. But equally, we must do the things we need to do to convince ordinary Australians that they have a stake in their own future.

Thank you. Authorised by Geoff Walsh, 19 National Circuit, Barton ACT 2600.
