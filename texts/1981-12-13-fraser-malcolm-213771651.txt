FOR MEDIA SUNDAY, 13 DECEMBER, 1981

ELECTORATE TALK

With Christmas approaching, there is a renewed burst of ' Â· industrial unrest, but the dispute in the Department of Social  Security has been going on for a long time because bans and  limitations were first imposed four years ago.

The main union involved - the Administrative and Clerical Officers  Association - is in effect claiming the right to determine staff  numbers, a position which would surely be unacceptable to any  private firm, and is certainly unacceptable to any elected

Government; and they have also attempted to decide for themselves  what duties they would perform, rather than carry out the work  they were employed by the community to do. Thanks to the loyalty  of the majority of the Departmental staff and the efforts of

the Government all pensions and the bulk of other benefits are  still being paid. But it is impossible to avoid disruption to  the payment of some benefits - especially sickness and unemployment  benefits - and to deal with all new applicants, and an increasing  number of hardship cases exist which are having to turn to voluntary  agencies for help.

Bans and limitations by A.C.O.A. members employed in the  Department of Social Security were first imposed in 1977. Further  bans were imposed during 1979 and 1980, and still further bans  were imposed this year on the implementation of the new health

arrangements for disadvantaged people, on new arrangements for  handling unemployment benefit forms,  on overtime, on certain  interviews for unemployed and sickness benefits, and giving priority  to representations from Federal Government members.

Every effort has been taken by the Government and the Department  to meet the stated concerns of the unionÃ¢ÂÂ  A consistently patient  approach has been adopted by management, especially because of  the Government's overriding concern that pensioners and social  welfare beneficiaries should not be inconvenienced further Ã¢ÂÂ But  bans have continued in Victoria and New South Wales, despite

considerable progress on staffing and conditions by the Government. In May 1980 a consultative working party on staffing and workloads  was established.  An amount of $2.4 million was allocated in the .   last Budget for the upgrading of accommodation in regional offices.  A comprehensive training programme was implemented, and additional

intensive technical training is to begin shortly. The Department  has been exempted from the 2% across-the-board cuts in staff ceilings  this year.  A temporary staffing allocation of 660 persons was made  to administer the introduction of the disadvantaged persons health,

scheme - some 350 of that allocation,  no longer required for that  purpose,  are to be retained until June to undertake an intensive  training programme in the Department, and overall, staffing in the  Department has increased from about 9,000 in 1976 to almost 12,400 todax

Senator Chaney has made it clear throughout that he would be  prepared to discuss with the union its stated grievances on  staffing and conditions matters,  but he has rightly refused  to negotiate while industrial action or the threat of such

action still exists.  Faced with a refusal to lift bans  despite all that has been done,  the Director-General of the  Department of Social Security put staff on notice on 28 October  that unless bans were lifted by 9 November the "no work as  directed - no pay" provisions would be used. Bans were lifted

except in N.S.W. and Victoria where employees implementing bans  were placed on no work as directed - no pay. The dispute has  further escalated in those States since then, with a campaign  of rolling stoppages, destructive tactics in regional offices,

and attempts by militant minority groups to take control of  officesi harassing and physically intimidating officers trying ;   to work.  In one case a regional manager was held a virtual  captive in his office.

On 4 December, Senator Chaney formally advised all staff in Victor:  and N.S.W. that any officer who undertook disruptive or  ihtimidatory actions, or refused to work as directed, would be  dealt with under the provisions of the Commonwealth Employees

(Employment Provisions) Act. Since that time over 400 employees  have been stood down under those provisions.

The Government has at all times remained willing to discuss the  union's stated grievances - although not in an adversary  atmosphere while industrial action still continued. The union  in these two States consistently refused or rejected this approach  and in so doing demonstrated that it was willing to pursue its  aims with scant regard for the welfare of the community. The  Government has made a number of special arrangements to minimise  disruption as a result of the dispute, but where people do not

receive their usual benefit cheques on time, and are faced with  serious difficulty, I suggest they go to the office of the  Department of Social Security which they normally attend and apply  for a counter cheque. Should that office be closed, they should

seek emergency relief from a designated voluntary agency which  the CommonwealÂ·th Government is assisting.

The Government is doing what it can not only to meet the needs  of those directly affected by the dispute,  but also to resolve  the dispute.  It was with the interests of the public in mind that  the Government met on Friday last with the A.C.T.U. to discuss

this dispute and other serious industrial matters.  As a result of  those discussions,  the A.C.T.U. President, Mr. Dolan, is to put  certain proposals to the Federal Secretary of the A.C.O.A., Mr. Munro, prior to a meeting of the Federal Executive of A.C.O.A.  due to take place on Monday.

We want this dispute to end.  Senator Chaney is prepared to consult  with the unions,  but we cannot concede the right of unions to  determine staffing levels and we cannot agree to consultations  while industrial action continues.
