MEDIA RELEASE  SENATOR THE HON. ERIC ABETZ  Leader of the Opposition in the Senate  Shadow Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations

Liberal Senator for Tasmania

2011-2012 Additional Estimates Summary

Labor Waste and Mismanagement

‘The Writing is on the Wall - even for the  Cookie Monster’  The 2011-2012 Additional estimates hearings were held on Monday, 13 February and Tuesday, 14  February (Group A) and Wednesday, 15 February and Thursday, 16 February (Group B) with Cross-

portfolio Indigenous matters on Friday, 17 February 2012.



(See Senate Estimates Transcripts here)



Taxpayer Funded Toilet Graffiti Study

When it comes to exposing LaborÃ¢ÂÂs waste and mismanagement the writing is on the  wall (literally). And indeed it was, with Minister Evans attempting to defend recent  media reports about LaborÃ¢ÂÂs taxpayer funding of a University research project into  graffiti on toilet walls.

Asked by Liberal Senator Brett Mason during Senate Estimates last week as to why  taxpayers should have to fork money out to fund the La Trobe University project,  Senator Evans slammed the media for running what he called “such sensationalised”  stories.

Once again LaborÃ¢ÂÂs mismanagement is everyone elseÃ¢ÂÂs fault and not their own or  was this just Labor attempting to find out what people are really saying about them.

When it comes to Waste and mismanagement this Additional Estimates exposed  that LaborÃ¢ÂÂs reckless spending and incompetence appears to have no bounds, here  are just a few glaring examples.

No Idea

Senator Fifield is still waiting to hear if Social Inclusion Minister Mark Butler has got  any official instructions from Julia Gillard as to exactly what he is supposed to do.  Senator Fifield said that two months after Mr Butler had difficulty explaining his new  Social Inclusion portfolio it appears he is still waiting for his official charter of  instructions. (Story here) Perhaps Mr ButlerÃ¢ÂÂs Charter will turn up amongst the graffiti  being researched by La Trobe University?

The Cookie Monster

Senator Fierravanti - Wells questioned Health Department officials about the  growing use of consultants in including a former public servant known as the “cookie  monster”. Senator Fierravanti - Wells accused Labor of breaking its promise to  reform the health system without increasing the size of the bureaucracy. The  Department has awarded a $440,000 contract to Health Policy Solutions (HPS).  Former Public Servant Professor Stephen Duckett, a consultant to HPS, was sacked  as head of The Alberta Health Board in Canada after he repeatedly refused to  answer questions by reporters whoÃ¢ÂÂd been chasing him, his excuse for not talking …  “IÃ¢ÂÂm eating my cookie.” (HereÃ¢ÂÂs the YouTube link). Professor Duckett, the so called  Ã¢ÂÂexpertÃ¢ÂÂ on activity based funding, has been brought out from Canada to tour  Australia to Ã¢ÂÂconsultÃ¢ÂÂ on activity based funding.

When asked at a recent consultation what impact activity based funding would have  on hospitals, Professor Duckett said “we have no idea”.  Needless to say when  questioned about this by Senator Fierravanti - Wells DoHA officials had no  response. No doubt officials would have been immediately on the phone to Professor  Duckett with a “please explain”. Despite the assurances that so called health reform  would not result in extra bureaucracy, we have seen the expansion of the  bureaucracy through the back door with consultancies doing work which should have  been done in house. For example, the Independent Hospital Pricing Authority had  contracted out its “key role” of developing the efficient price hospitals will be paid for  each service.

Tragedy at Sea blamed on Red Tape

Senator Michaelia cash extracted an admission from Customs and Border Protection  officials that red tape was the reason for the delay of almost four hours before  authorities launched a rescue mission to go to the aid of a missing asylum seeker  boat with more than 100 people onboard. None of the asylum seekers were ever  found and are believed to have drowned at sea. Labor initially denied any knowledge  of the boat however they have since admitted a distress call was received. Following  an investigation by the Herald Sun and reported last week in the Sydney Morning  Herald it was revealed that the Government had been tracking the vessel as it left  Indonesia and that they knew the boat was in trouble. Senator Cash was told by  Departmental officials that Border Protection officers took three and a half hours  before deciding on a Ã¢ÂÂset of wordsÃ¢ÂÂ that could be used to tell Maritime Safety about  how they knew the boat was in trouble and where it was. Senator Cash has  demanded a full explanation from the Department.

Boat arrivals blow the budget at Immigration

During questioning by Coalition Senators Gary Humphries and Michaelia Cash it was  revealed that estimated costs at the Immigration Department have blown out by  more than $860 million over four years. Officials conceded that the continued influx  of asylum seekers arriving in Australia by boat is the main reason for the blow out.

Fair Work Australia/HSU - The Investigation goes on and on and on

Charge it up to the union!

Senators Eric Abetz and Michael Ronaldson continued their questioning of officials  from the Australian Government Solicitor and Fair Work Australia about the Craig  Thompson/HSU affair. (See their joint news conference here).

Legal fees soar

The Australian Government Solicitor confirmed that so far Fair Work AustraliaÃ¢ÂÂs  three-year investigation into Labor MP Craig ThomsonÃ¢ÂÂs use of his trade union credit  card has cost $912,000 in legal fees.  And thatÃ¢ÂÂs only the legal fees from the AGS;  fees from private sector legal firms engaged by FWA will be extra.

Additionally FWA has paid out $100,000 in accountancy fees which is a high price to  pay for Mr ThomsonÃ¢ÂÂs vote, which the PM needs to maintain her Parliamentary  majority. But donÃ¢ÂÂt expect FWAÃ¢ÂÂs report anytime soon.

An inquiry into the inquiry

Admitting that its snail-like investigation into Mr ThomsonÃ¢ÂÂs credit card spending is  taking an “unreasonably” long time, FWA has now appointed KPMG to “review” why  the original investigation is taking so long. The reviewÃ¢ÂÂs expected cost and  completion date are unknown. Senator Abetz said, “This is completely  unacceptable.”

The email trail

Senator Abetz was told that there was more contact than had previously been  revealed between staff from Gillard Government ministersÃ¢ÂÂ offices and FWA about  the investigation into Craig Thomson, with staff of former workplace relations  minister, Chris EvansÃ¢ÂÂ and current minister Bill ShortenÃ¢ÂÂs offices contacting the  authority. (See feature in the Australian here).

Abolishing the ABCC - Labor gives the green light to militant unionists to return to  the bad old days of coercion, thuggery and illegal activities.

Senators Abetz and Mary Jo Fisher asked the Australian Building and Construction  Commission about their work in stamping out thuggery, coercion and illegality in the  building and construction sector. The Committee also discussed, thanks to a Labor  Senator, the 2007 KPMG Econtech report that showed the ABCC had contributed a  $5.2 billion economic welfare gain to the Australian economy. Sadly, later in the day  the Government moved an amendment to their bill to abolish the ABCC that would  turn its replacement from a toothless tiger to a toothless mouse. (See Senator  AbetzÃ¢ÂÂs media conference here). (See his interview with Andrew Bolt here)

$1 million to tell Labor the Carbon Tax isnÃ¢ÂÂt popular

Senator Birmingham asked why the Government spent $1.03 million on ten focus  groups and tracking research to gauge public feedback to its unpopular Carbon Tax.   The research was conducted following the GovernmentÃ¢ÂÂs $32 million advertising  blitz.  Coalition Senators pointed out that it shouldnÃ¢ÂÂt take $1 million in opinion  research for the Government to understand that Australians donÃ¢ÂÂt like LaborÃ¢ÂÂs  Carbon Tax, and arguing that if the Labor Party wanted to conduct polling on ways to  sell it to voters then the Labor Party should pay for it.

International Carbon Price

Meanwhile as Senator MacDonald pointed out, at $23 per tonne, Australia has the  worldÃ¢ÂÂs highest Carbon Tax - and just how high it is compared with other countries  was confirmed by officials from the Department of Climate Change.  The officials  reported that CaliforniaÃ¢ÂÂs Carbon Allowances are trading for $14 per tonne, and the  European price was 7.79 Euros per tonne (A$9.63).  This is further proof that LaborÃ¢ÂÂs  Carbon Tax will make Australia less competitive.

Labor spends $200,000 on a Carbon Tax Logo

Senator Birmingham discovered that the cost of developing a logo and branding for  LaborÃ¢ÂÂs Climate Change Department has cost the taxpayer a massive $200,000. We  all remember the $61,000 of taxpayersÃ¢ÂÂ money Labor spent on developing the

Carbon Offset Standard logo  uncovered by Senator Abetz in last MayÃ¢ÂÂs  Senate Estimates.

Meanwhile it was also revealed to Senator Birmingham that former Telstra director  Chloe Munro will head LaborÃ¢ÂÂs Clean Energy Regulator overseeing LaborÃ¢ÂÂs Carbon  Tax on an annual salary of $535,000 which is almost $100,000 more than we pay  the Prime Minister. And Senator Colbeck discovered that the Department of  Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry spent $77,627 on consultants to come up with its  new Ã¢ÂÂidentity brandingÃ¢ÂÂ.

Dairy farmers will be hit hard by LaborÃ¢ÂÂs Carbon Tax.

Questioned by Nationals Senator John Williams officers from the Australian Bureau  of Agricultural & Resource Economics (ABARES) revealed that the Carbon Tax will  add $4,200 to average dairy farmersÃ¢ÂÂ costs, rising to $4,500 when the Carbon Tax is  introduced on diesel used by heavy transports in 2014.

$55+ million to sell broken promises

The Government will spend $millions of taxpayersÃ¢ÂÂ money to sell its broken election  promise to not means test the Private Health Insurance Rebate. Legislation to  impose the means test passed through the House of Representatives last week.

Senator Sue Boyce was unable to extract an answer from Health Department  officials when asked whether taxpayers would have to pay for a proposed $11.5  million dollar advertising campaign to explain LaborÃ¢ÂÂs changes to the Private Health  Insurance Rebate. LaborÃ¢ÂÂs use of advertising to sell its broken election promises is  not new.   In July 2011 the Prime Minister personally approved spending $31.5  million to sell the Carbon Tax she promised not to introduce.  And this was in  addition to $13.7 million already allocated for a “communications and public  engagement” strategy1.

Shorten fails

Senator Cormann exposed LaborÃ¢ÂÂs failure to properly assess the impact of its Future  of Financial Advice changes on business and consumers after an the Office of Best  Practice regulation gave a damning assessment of the FOFA legislation currently  before the Parliament. Senator Cormann was told the GovernmentÃ¢ÂÂs regulatory  impact statements did not have enough information about the impact on businesses  and consumers and the cost benefit of the contentious parts of FOFA for the  Government to make informed decisions. Industry says the changes will cost $700  million to implement upfront and $350 million a year there after. Senator Corman  said Minister Shorten has failed to demonstrate that the increased costs to business  and consumers are justified.

Dangers of picking winners

The dangers of Governments picking winners have been highlighted by the  revelation that the technology platform used for the first three towns to receive the  NBN rollout is already obsolete and needs to be replaced.  Senator David Bushby  discovered that the three Tasmanian towns, all much used for picture opportunities  by visiting ministers, will need to be retrofitted, including the hardware and  equipment installed in homes and businesses.  The cost, of course, ends up with  taxpayers.

A failure to connect

Senator Mason exposed LaborÃ¢ÂÂs Ã¢ÂÂcomputers in schoolsÃ¢ÂÂ farce during estimates after  it was revealed that four and a half years into the program only eight mainland  schools out of 2650 secondary schools nation wide have been connected by the  Federal Government. So much for LaborÃ¢ÂÂs so called Ã¢ÂÂdigital education revolutionÃ¢ÂÂ.

Cheaper to buy a new TV

Senator Simon Birmingham asked Labor to explain why the cost of each set-top box  delivered under LaborÃ¢ÂÂs digital TV rollout is now being estimated at up to $698,  almost double the GovernmentÃ¢ÂÂs $350 original estimate.   But, as the Coalition  warned when the scheme was announced in last yearÃ¢ÂÂs Budget, even at $350 per  installation it is grossly overpriced.  As a Harvey Norman spokesman said at the  time, "We can do a top-range, LCD digital television for $199, which you don't even  need a set-top box for.  All you have to do is plug a lead from the TV into the wall  and one to the antenna."

Cheaper at Wrest Point Casino

The Government spent $15 million establishing the temporary Pontville Detention  Centre to house up to 400 immigration detainees for six months.  Pontville accepted  its first detainees on 1 September 2011 and is scheduled to close on 1 March.   Senator Abetz remarked that rather than spending $15 million at Pontville, 400  detainees could have been accommodated at HobartÃ¢ÂÂs Wrest Pont Casino for  $9,288,000, a saving of more than $5 million of taxpayersÃ¢ÂÂ money.

Charter flights for Asylum seekers

The Government chartered an aircraft to fly 35 detainees from the Curtin Detention  Centre in WA to its new temporary detention centre at Pontville in Tasmania. The  cost of the charter was $189,500.  It would have cost only $62,895 to fly them  Qantas Business class, a saving of more than $100,000.

2,000+ claims against dodgy Ã¢ÂÂpink battÃ¢ÂÂ installers

Department of Climate Change officials revealed to Senator Simon Birmingham that  2,035 letters of demand have been issued to installers seeking $21.3 million to fix  problems caused by the GovernmentÃ¢ÂÂs Ã¢ÂÂpink battsÃ¢ÂÂ home insulation scheme.   However, just $844,000 has been recovered. $18.1 million remains outstanding,  much of it for at least nine months.  A further $2.3 million has been written off or  cancelled.  Australian taxpayers are still paying for the GovernmentÃ¢ÂÂs incompetent  management of a scheme linked to at least four deaths and more than 200 house  fires.









7



CarrÃ¢ÂÂs Confessional

In yet another example of LaborÃ¢ÂÂs recklessness we learned courtesy of Senator  Ryan and Sophie Mirabella that the Government has breached the rules of the  Automotive Transformation Scheme after Minister Carr confessed that at least $34  million has been granted to car makers despite the original funding criteria not being  met by the ATS. We also learned that there has been no evaluation done of the  failed $1.3 billion Green Car Innovation Fund.

University infrastructure unfunded under expansion

Senator Mason discovered that Labor has failed to plan or factor in the cost of the  infrastructure which will be needed for the hundreds of thousand of extra students  flooding into the University system over the next decade. Senate Estimates was told  that funds have been flowing out at a rate of $1 billion per year with no plans by  Labor to replenish it. Senator Mason pointed out that Labor had been running down  the capital of the Higher Education Endowment Fund set up by the former Coalition  Government to upgrade the infrastructure of Australian universities. Peter Costello  established the $6b fund in the days when Australia ran a budget surplus with the  interest distributed annually. Labor promises to add another $5b to the Fund,  bringing it to $11b, have come to nothing. Instead Labor has raided it and run it down  so the Fund now has a balance of only $2.7b.

Greens Wotif donation questioned

Senator Ryan asked the Australian Electoral Commission about Wotif founder,  Graeme WoodÃ¢ÂÂs $1.7m donation of TV advertising to the Australian Greens at the  last Federal election.  Senator Ryan asked the AEC about implications for funding  disclosure if the GreensÃ¢ÂÂ TV ad campaign turned out to be linked to a major  corporate TV advertising campaign by online accommodation provider Wotif.

Serious Secrets and Scandalous Skyping

Senator David Johnson exposed during Senate Estimates that four Labor Members  of Parliament including at least one Cabinet Minister were aware of serious  allegations about dubious security vetting processes in Defence last year yet nothing  was done until the claims were aired on Lateline in May 2011. It was revealed that  20,000 security clearances, including 5,000 top secret clearances, would now have  to be re-vetted after the claims about staff being advised to make up details of  applicants to fill in gaps were found to be true.

We were also told that a series of defence reviews stemming from the Australian  Defence Force AcademyÃ¢ÂÂs Ã¢ÂÂSkype ScandalÃ¢ÂÂ have so far cost taxpayers almost $12  million.

Labor Spat over Australia Network

Senator Birmingham asked questions about whether taxpayers had been the meat in  the sandwich in a spat between Julia Gillard and Kevin Rudd over who should run  the Australia Network, the ABC or SKY. Senator Birmingham said “Julia GillardÃ¢ÂÂs  own Department intervened to prevent a Cabinet submission from Kevin RuddÃ¢ÂÂs  Department proceeding with their recommendation for the awarding of this contract”  and that “Julia Gillard wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt let Kevin Rudd get his way, or a tenderer remotely  connected to News Limited, succeed.”

Labor spends $6 million on new website

After more than a year behind schedule the new Parliament House website has been  launched $600.000 over budget at a cost to taxpayers of $6.1 million.

Pokies Porkies

Officials from FaHCSIA told Senator Bernardi during Senate Estimates that despite  being aware that the peak body representing poker machine manufacturers believes  the timeline for LaborÃ¢ÂÂs poker machine reform plan is unrealistic, no advice from  poker machine manufacturers was sought. Senator Bernardi said this exposed Labor  as knowing their so called poker machine reform plan is fundamentally flawed.

Meanwhile Senator Concetta Fierravanti - Wells ascertained that Labor has sought  conflict of interest advice regarding the ACT poker machine trial given that the ALP  runs Clubs subject to the trail. Senator Fierravanti - Wells said the Australian  taxpayers are entitled to be sure that Labor was not engaged in some grubby  deliberate plan to funnel more money into ALP coffers.

And Department officials at FaHCSIA confirmed to Senator Abetz that the  Government had technical advice indicating LaborÃ¢ÂÂs promise to Andrew Wilkie on  poker machines could not be met and that they know about it 9 months before Mr  Wilkie was finally told. (See the Australian story here).

A Conflict of interest?

Senator Fierravanti - Wells also discovered there is nobody working in the alcohol  policy area in the Health Department who has any alcohol industry experience.   Professor Daube, the Ã¢ÂÂalcohol adviserÃ¢ÂÂ according to the Australian National  Preventative Health Agency” website is an anti-alcohol activist.  So how can you  develop sensible alcohol policy when there is no-one with experience of the alcohol  industry?

Chocolate Swapping

Senator Fierravanti - Wells also asked the Department about criticism from Medical  experts concerning the $872 million 6 year Swap It, DonÃ¢ÂÂt Stop it Campaign - gems  on its website include swapping a large portion of milk chocolate for a small piece of  dark chocolate. Really, who would swap Old Gold for the famous Cadbury glass and  a half?

Aged Care - LaborÃ¢ÂÂs $1.9 billion blow out

Labor faces a $1.9 billion blow out in its aged care budget. Senate Estimates was  told expenditure on aged care is growing faster than anticipated and that the  Department of Health and Ageing would spend $444 million more than originally  budgeted and up to $1.9billion more than anticipated over the next four years. (See  story in the Australian here).

To See or Not to See

Senator Birmingham raised the issue of Government funding for the ABCÃ¢ÂÂs coverage  of local football. ABC Managing Director Mark Scott was unable to give a  commitment during Senate Estimates to this or coverage of the Paralympics or  womenÃ¢ÂÂs sports.

Woof - Woof

Senator David Fawcett discovered that the RAAFÃ¢ÂÂs VIP luxury aircraft which routinely  transport the Prime Minister along with other Government Ministers and staff have  also been used to transport private pets.

Mining skills shortage

Senator Cash raised concerns by mining companies that the threshold for resource  projects to qualify for Enterprise Migration Agreements has been set too high.  Senator Cash said Mining companies want it lowered to 1000 workers and she also  queried the role of trade unions in the approval process.

Mining Tax - Take six

Senator Cormann has demanded that the Treasurer come clean with the Australian  people after it was revealed that the LaborÃ¢ÂÂs mining tax will cost at least $4 billion  more over the current forward estimates than it will raise. Senator Corman said only  Labor could try to implement a new tax that will leave the Budget worse off.

SBS criticised

Senator Kroger strongly criticised SBS management for its decision to screen Ã¢ÂÂThe  PromiseÃ¢ÂÂ, a four part drama series, despite knowing that the subject matter would be  highly controversial and offensive to the Jewish community. (See the Punch article  here and story in the Australian here, SMH here other media here, and here).

Misconduct probe to cost $millions

Senator Kroger ascertained that law firm DLA PiperÃ¢ÂÂs review of Australian Defence  Force Academy misconduct allegations had cost $7.1m in legal fees in 12 months.  And thatÃ¢ÂÂs just for a scoping exercise. Phase 2 of the review has not yet  commenced.





10



Limited access

Senator Brandis raised the fact that the Prime MinisterÃ¢ÂÂs Communications Director,  John McTernan was not an Australian citizen and therefore not able to obtain the  security clearances that would usually be required for such an appointment. The  story was carried in the Australian. Apparently Mr McTernan has been issued with a  waiver that limits his access to some sensitive material.

Small business snubbed?

Senator Ryan severely embarrassed Small Business Minister and Sports Minister,  Mark Arbib, by asking him whether he would be attending the National small  business summit on 1 & 2 August or whether he would be at the Olympic Games in  London. (See Senator RyanÃ¢ÂÂs recent Media Release on Senator ArbibÃ¢ÂÂs lack of  attention to his Small Business portfolio here).

One Sided

Senator Bernardi exposed the fact that information CSIRO produces and distributes  to school children under the Carbon for Kids program only presents one opinion  about what is driving climate change. This was despite the fact that CSIRO advised  the school childrenÃ¢ÂÂs teachers that climate change was a complicated topic and  could be controversial, leading to many different opinions. (See story here).

Toddlers targeted too

Meanwhile Senator Simon Birmingham was told that Labor is even turning to  toddlers to help sell its climate change message. Senate Estimates was told that  Labor handed over $150,000 to the producers of childrenÃ¢ÂÂs TV program Ã¢ÂÂDirtgirlworldÃ¢ÂÂ  to help spread their message about reducing energy. A further $200.000 was  handed over to run climate programs in primary schools and $93,000 given to the  ACTU. (See story here).

Sub trouble

Senator Johnson established that Australia could be without a submarine defence  between the retirement of the existing Collins submarines, scheduled for 2025, and  the active entry of their replacement.  Defence officials admitted that it could take 20  years from design drawing board to water, leaving a significant gap. Meanwhile more  than 800 South Australian jobs are potentially at risk at the Australian Submarine  Corporation according to media reports.

ABS land ownership data criticised

Senator Heffernan was critical of ABS data collected for a report about foreign  acquisition of agricultural land in Australia branding it as meaningless because its  focus was on business ownership rather than on land ownership. Senator Heffernan  said “they didnÃ¢ÂÂt look at trusts, they didnÃ¢ÂÂt look at mining companies, they didnÃ¢ÂÂt go to  the land titles office … how can you can say who owns the land?”



11



Northern security neglected

Senator Eggleston drew attention to the low profile of the Australian Defence Force  in North West Australia and the need for increased infrastructure in the region. It was  revealed that naval patrol boasts spend just 90 days a year in the region despite the  fact that the North West has massive resource projects including North West Shelf  and AustraliaÃ¢ÂÂs biggest ports at Dampier and Port Headland. CDFS Hurley agreed  that the North West had been neglected by the ADF in recent times and told the  committee that the Tanami Road between Halls Creek and Alice Springs was just  one improvement that needed to be made as part of the infrastructure overhaul.

Childcare Operators and Families left stranded

Senator Chris Back asked questions of officials from the Department of Education,  Employment and Workplace Relations who were left red faced attempting to explain  how a computer meltdown involving the Childcare Management System has resulted  in delays to Government payments to and from Childcare Centres and families.  Opposition spokesperson for Childcare, Susan Ley said there were almost 80 calls a  day to DEEWR since early January from Childcare Operators concerned about  payment delays and other anomalies.

Labor abandons Work for the Dole

Senator Bernardi uncovered alarming figures which reveal that the Gillard  Government has all but killed off the Work for the Dole program. Senator Bernardi  was told participation in the Work for the Dole program has dropped by around 60  percent since the Howard Government left office. Shadow Minister for Employment  Participation, Susan Ley said “The real tragedy here is that Labor has killed off the  hopes of tens of thousands of Australians who might have had a better chance of  getting back on the job”.

National Shame

Senator Mason asked why Labor has failed to keep their promise to build three  Indigenous boarding facilities in the Northern Territory. During questioning at Senate  Estimates it was revealed that construction has only just commenced at one site and  the government has no idea when any work will commence on the others.

Indigenous programs in disarray

Senator Scullion said LaborÃ¢ÂÂs Indigenous programs have now fallen so much into  disarray that the Government has no clue about what programs they are running and  how much they cost. Despite being assured only a week before Senate Estimates  that Labor would provide information about the cost of their Indigenous programs the  Committee was told it was too hard to deliver.







12



Skills shortage in the bush questioned

Senator Fiona Nash questioned officials from the Higher Education Group of the  Department of Industry, innovation, Science, research and Tertiary Education about  the critical shortage of graduates and skilled workers in the agriculture sector citing  the example of the University of Western Sydney which is being forced to cancel its  agriculture course this year at its Hawkesbury campus due to low enrolments.  Senator Nash also questioned the DepartmentÃ¢ÂÂs modelling which states the  agriculture sector will grow at only 1.4% per annum to 2015-16 and represents only  2.8% of the national workforce. Senator Nash said these figures differ significantly to  figures widely used within the agriculture sector in that agriculture employs 1.6  million in farming and related industries, representing 17.2% of the national  workforce.

Labor cost cutting targets regional students

Senator Nash also accused Labor of failing to provide a reason why thereÃ¢ÂÂs a  parental income test for regional students applying for the independent youth  allowance. Senator Nash said despite Labor last year being forced into an  embarrassing back down on other unfair changes to the independent youth  allowance, such as the 30 hour a week work rule, the parental income test has  stayed.

Concerns that Volunteers face fines or jail under new Labor laws

Senator Mitch Fifield raised concerns that volunteers could be fined up to $300,000  or imprisoned for five years for breaching LaborÃ¢ÂÂs new harmonised occupational  Health and Safety Laws. Workplace Relations Minister Bill Shorten was forced to  convene a crisis meeting of volunteer groups last month after the sector expressed  alarm at the possible ramifications of LaborÃ¢ÂÂs new laws on their sector. Senator  Fifield said “Legitimate concerns remain over the chilling effect these laws may have  on the culture of volunteering.” The Coalition has urged Labor to delay the  implementation of their new OH&S laws for 12 months to give organisations a  chance to fully understand the implications of the new regime.

$100m spent on MDBP using out of date data

Senator Joyce questioned why Labor is spending over $100 million to develop the  Murray-Darling Basin Plan which is not even based on up to date information.  Senator Joyce says the Murray-Darling Basin Authority is relying on out of date data  for its recommendations to take 2,750 gigalitres from productive use in the MDB.

ASIC coy on ad campaign

Senator Bushby asked ASIC to comment on reports its actively examining the  Industry Super NetworkÃ¢ÂÂs “compare the pair” advertising campaign following  questioning about some of the underlying calculations behind the advertising  campaign. ASIC Commissioner Peter Kell acknowledged the issue, but said the  regulator did not comment on operational matters. (Story here).



13



APRA

Senator Bushby also sought answers to questions on notice put to the Australian  Prudential Regulation Authority relating to enforcement actions over flawed unit  pricing and asset valuation practices as well as actions with respect to unresolved  conflict of interest issues.

Public Servants to lose jobs under Labor

In further questions by Senator Gary Humphries to the Department of Immigration  officials confirmed the Department is looking at slashing public service jobs within its  department to cope with LaborÃ¢ÂÂs $47 million cut to funding. Any job losses come on  top of the confirmed loss of 180 positions in DIAC arising from a new enterprise  agreement.

Security issues questioned over Flag burning

Senator Scott Ryan sought answers from the Department of Parliamentary Services  as to how indigenous protesters got away with taking a fire onto the Parliamentary  forecourt which was used to set an Australian Flag alight following the Tent Embassy  protest debacle. Senate Estimates was told that the Usher of the Black Rod had  given permission for protesters to light a small ceremonial fire. (SMH story is here).  Meanwhile Senator Brandis accused Julia Gillard of attempting to cover up the cover  up over the Tent Embassy protest affair.

Fishers hit

Senator Colbeck was told that a rise in licence fees for Tasmanian fishers has been  partly due to the Government ending subsidisation of levies.

Forestry Jobs

Senator Colbeck also questioned Forestry Minister Joe Ludwig about the loss of  business and jobs in the Tasmanian timber industry following an announcement from  Tasmanian company Ta Ann that it was shedding jobs. Senator Colbeck said Julia  Gillard and Tasmanian Premier Lara Giddings must take full responsibility.

Labor puts NationÃ¢ÂÂs Bio-security and Quarantine measures at risk

Senate Estimates was told that the Gillard Government is to axe principal scientists  from the Department of Agriculture employed in key roles as part of the NationÃ¢ÂÂs bio-security defence. Shadow Minister for Agriculture and Food Security, John Cobb  says “This is an astonishing move that flies in the face of the GovernmentÃ¢ÂÂs own  advice … rather than bolster the expertise with our quarantine system; Labor is fast  tracking its shutdown.”







14



The final word

Having established at the beginning that Labor has spent a bucket of taxpayersÃ¢ÂÂ  money on a project to research graffiti in womenÃ¢ÂÂs toilets itÃ¢ÂÂs perhaps worthy of note  that estimates week was also the week when it was revealed that Julia Gillard has  banned Ministers from taking pens and paper into Caucus meetings.

Maybe if sheÃ¢ÂÂd taken the pens and paper off them before she told them she was  banning their use then someone wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt have used a pen and paper to write it  down and leak the story.

Meanwhile over at the Department of the Senate thereÃ¢ÂÂs more news on pens and  paper. They are conducting a risk assessment for stationery items used by its  officers. Senator Ryan wanted to know what the risk assessment was for using a  pen.

Finally we learned that the Department of Families, Housing Community Services  and Indigenous Affairs is spending $55,000 to teach staff how to write to the  Minister. Given that the Minister herself has been banned from using a pen and  paper, perhaps this is prudent.
