TONY ABBOTT:

What we saw today from the Treasurer and the Finance Minister was the incredible shrinking budget  surplus. We’ve got scarcely a third of the financial year over and already a third of the projected surplus has  gone. I want to make it very clear that in my judgment and in the Coalition’s judgment, this is a government  that will never, ever deliver an honest budget surplus. Even to deliver today’s cook the books surplus,  families have been hit. This is the fundamental point: Wayne Swan is hurting families’ budgets so he can  patch up the Government’s budget.

There are cuts to education, there are cuts to health, there are cuts to the baby bonus, there are cuts to  superannuation - all cuts to families’ budgets so that the Government can patch up its budget. Families are  suffering so that the Government can look better.

This is essentially a government which is incapable of controlling its own expenditure and just to give one  emblematic example in MYEFO today, there’s $20 million more on NBN advertising. The NBN, as we  know, has just 6,500 live fibre connections. This is an enormous white elephant which has so far paid more  in its chief executive’s salary than it has actually gained in revenue from its customers.

To give another example of just how precarious all this government’s numbers are, without $5 billion-plus  of company tax bring-forward in the next financial year, we would actually have a significant deficit next  year not a $2 billion surplus. So, this is another fiddle in order to give the Government an election year  surplus.

There is consistently from this government a fundamental failure of economic management and to give you  another emblematic illustration of this, in 2004-05 with unemployment at five per cent, the Howard  Government delivered a budget surplus of 1.5 per cent of GDP despite terms of trade 40 per cent lower than  last year when this government delivered a deficit of three per cent of GDP. So, this is a government which  is fundamentally incapable of good economic management.

2



I suppose my principal disappointment with the economics of this government which was on display again  today, there was nothing in the statement today to indicate that this government is serious about trying to  give us higher economic growth; trying to give us a fundamentally stronger economy. There was nothing  that would boost productivity, for instance. There was nothing that would cut red tape, for instance. What  we saw from this government again today is illustration that this is a government, a Prime Minister and a  Treasurer that has a political strategy rather than a real economic strategy.

The bottom line always with this government is that more taxes are on the way and the Treasurer, I think,  gave the game away in his press conference when he said that there would be further structural adjustments  to pay for things like Gonski and the NDIS. That is code for wait for more taxes; more taxes that they won’t  talk about before the election but are inevitable if this government gets re-elected.

Well, I think there is a clear choice between a Coalition that believes in making the changes necessary to  boost economic growth and a government which is addicted to regulation, to spending and to taxes. We do  have an economic plan and our economic plan relies on getting spending down, getting taxes down, getting  productivity up and further engaging with Asia. That is how we will get the economic growth that can  deliver for Australian families the prosperity that they want; the hope, reward and opportunity that they’re  entitled to.

Over to you, Joe.

JOE HOCKEY:

Thanks very much, Tony. This document raises fair more questions than it answers. There are cuts to health  but there’s no funding for the NDIS. There are cuts to education but there’s no funding for Gonski. The  $120 billion of unfunded promises remain unfunded. There is no economic strategy in this document. It is  quite clearly a continuation of a cook the books strategy.

If I can go into a fair bit of detail, because I think people need to be aware of some of the detail here. In  terms of the terms of trade, they remain far higher today than at any time under the previous Coalition  government. Spending today and into the forward estimates is always higher of the last two years of the  Coalition government. The only way the Government is going to get to a forecast promised surplus this year  is with an additional $30 billion in taxation revenue this year and, in addition, other sources of revenue are  now at record levels and that includes dividends, $400 million out of Medicare this year which is about $250  per policyholder, half a billion dollars out of the Reserve Bank at a time - some would say - of vulnerability;  over $200 million out of Australia Post.

If I can just go to some of the initiatives - the Pay As You Go for companies fiddling the payments for  company tax raises $8.3 billion and it goes down to companies with a turnover of just $20 million. So, it  covers a vast number of companies. As Tony said, that brings into next year, an election year, about 14  months of company tax which means that is the difference between a $2.2 billion surplus and substantially  less. So, they’re booking an extra $5.5 billion next year in an election year in order to get to surplus and of  course the company tax working group we’re told hasn’t even seen this proposal, yet it’s meant to be taken  seriously by the Government.

The Future Fund - changes in accounting rules for the Future Fund - delivers $2 billion to the bottom line  and $417 million this year. Nearly half the surplus this year is a fiddle in the treatment of the Future Fund -  not any extra revenue to the total government, just a change in the accounting treatment. Private health  insurance, they’re ripping $1.1 billion out of private health insurance. Asylum seekers, an extra $1.1 billion  this year alone and I note there is an unexplained discrepancy in MYEFO page 243, the Government says to  increase the number of humanitarian migration places it will cost $432.4 million over four years and in the  panel report, the expert panel report, it said the panel has been advised, that is the Government advised the  expert panel, an increase in the humanitarian programme from its current level would be in the order of $1.4  billion over the forward estimates. So, the Government needs to explain there the missing billion dollars.

3





It is also the case that there is a dark unexplained allotment in the contingency reserve which means the  Government are budgeting for a boost this year of more than $2 billion in the Government’s budget but there  not explaining where it’s coming from. It’s extraordinary. MYEFO in 2009-10, the contingency reserve was  plus $508 million. The following year it was minus $750 million. In 2011-12 it was minus $850 million. At  budget time it was about the same. Now, it’s minus $2.8 billion. So, $2 billion pops into the budget from  nowhere in this current financial year with no explanation from the Government, which I must say, is quite  extraordinary.

Furthermore, as Tony mentioned, $460 million on cuts to the Baby Bonus; cuts to research - $500 million;  cuts to apprenticeships - I thought they were about jobs, jobs, jobs - $277 million; superannuation, after 12  months of a dormant account, your superannuation will be transferred to the Australian Taxation Office.  This year alone it’s worth $555 million - this year alone, in six months. So, don’t go overseas for 12 months  to work. Journalists get postings overseas, Wayne Swan’s going to take your super which I’m expecting  would be very generous. The self managed superannuation funds - 480,000 self managed super funds will  have a 36 per cent increase in their fees to raise $319 million.

I saw Penny Wong’s comments on grants, the grants freeze, extraordinary. They’ve frozen it this year to  increase grants next year, an election year. The grants freeze this year raises $324 million, but over the  forward estimates it reduces because they’re shuffling it out into an election year.

They’re increasing penalties by $185 million and it goes on and on and on. These are questions that need to  be answered by the Treasurer. As Tony said, we have a plan. Our plan is simple. It is about growing the pie,  it is about living within your means. It is about providing an incentive for people to work harder, earn more  money and care for their families. This is a budget that targets health, education and families but it leaves  everyone confused because it just has no economic agenda at all. It is simply about the politics of the day.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, some of these things are going to require legislation. I know it’s early days but can you see the  Coalition opposing private health changes and the baby bonus changes and anything else that you could say,  off the bat, that that’s not going to pass muster with the Coalition?

TONY ABBOTT:

Phil, look, obviously we don’t like these changes but I’m not going to state now exactly what our position  will be, we have to further digest this. Don’t forget, we’ve only had it for about three hours. Look, our  fundamental commitment is to get the economy on a path of sustainable growth and to return the budget to  sustainable surpluses. That’s our fundamental commitment and we will be making our decisions about these  specific measures in the light of that fundamental commitment. Lenore?

QUESTION:

Are you saying that you could get the budget into a sustainable surplus without cutting spending that  impacts on families or on education? Are you saying you wouldn’t consider cuts to those sorts of things  when you undertake the budgeting task?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, in terms of the budgeting task we can do better than this mob because we are committed to the sort of  reforms that are necessary to produce an economy that’s growing more strongly than is currently the case.  We are committed to those reforms and we are certainly committed to eliminating unnecessary government  spending and look, the NBN is one example, border protection blow-outs are another example and every

time you look at what this government is doing, you come up with more examples of waste, the most recent  one being $30,000 for a portrait of Peter Slipper. Andrew?

QUESTION:

Can I get your view specifically on the PAYG changes, because if you win next year’s election it will  actually be to Mr Hockey’s advantage because he’s going to get a $5 billion windfall. What sort of attitude  do you bring to that change? I mean, do you think it’s a good or bad idea, on first blush?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, Andrew, whenever we see cooking the books, we will call it out. Whenever I see cooking the books, I  will call it out. I want to make that absolutely crystal clear and this is, plainly, another example of fiscal  fiddling in order to get the Government out of a political jam. Now, but for the $5 billion bring-forward in  company tax, but for the fact that they’re going to get 14 months of company tax in 12 months, there  wouldn’t be a $2 billion surplus in the election year, there would be a $3 billion deficit in the election year.  So, this is all about political management, it’s not about economic management and the fundamental  problem, though, is that they are hurting family budgets to help their own budget.

JOE HOCKEY:

I can just add a couple of things. This has obviously had no modelling done behind it. It’s come out of the  blue, it’s taken people by shock. It will affect dividends for millions of shareholders; it will affect the costs  of capital for companies. This money is coming from somewhere and it’s coming from the corporate line of  business and this is not just big business. This gets down to small businesses. I mean, you can have pubs  with $20 million turnover easily. You can have large pharmacists with enormous turnovers and yet their  margins are not so significant. But the bottom line is, this is going to fundamentally change the way some  business does business and no one’s asked any questions about it because this is the first we heard about it,  like you, today.

QUESTION:

Does that mean you’d reverse it in government?

JOE HOCKEY:

My view is you’ve got to speak to business first to find out what the impact is. It will vary from business to  business. For example, some businesses will have bulk cash flows at various times. I mean, agricultural  businesses, they get their money when it comes in and, you know, they might have held that money to  address overdrafts and a range of other things. Who knows what the impact is going to be on those  businesses?

TONY ABBOTT:

Laura, it’s telling that this is a government which says that it’s trying to rebuild its relationship with  business; this is a government which has a business tax working group. Here is a very significant change to  business tax - an $8 billion change to business tax which was decided and announced without any prior  consultation. Now, I know governments don’t want to give away the last detail of what they are about to  announce, but surely in broad terms this could have been discussed with the business community before  making an announcement of this nature.

QUESTION:

5



Can I just clarify - you've both talked about the fact that this doesn’t have an underlying strategy to it. Could  I just, as a baseline proposition, do you think the surplus figure that the Government has ended up with,  however it’s got there, is about the right strategy? Should they have done more at this point in time or should  they have done less in terms of the budget balance?

JOE HOCKEY:

They should have done it previously. We said the stimulus was too big. We didn’t oppose the second  stimulus per se in saying there should be no stimulus, we said that the second stimulus was way too big and  all along we have identified waste, we have identified mismanagement by this government and we have  railed against it. We have previously said, for example, that in the abolition of the carbon tax and mining  tax, the packages will go. You know, we’ve said that.

QUESTION:

But in a broader economic sense, in terms of the impact on…

JOE HOCKEY:

Sure, our view has always been about getting back to surplus, but it’s got to be a real surplus and it’s rather  telling that Wayne Swan says don’t worry, this is not really a surplus that’s going to have an impact on the  economy, it’s not really a real surplus, but we’re pretending it is. So, the actual economic impact of this,  even by the Treasurer’s own admission, is that this is not a surplus.

TONY ABBOTT:

Laura, again, look at what the Howard/Costello Government achieved in 2004/2005. At a period with  unemployment at five per cent, they achieved a 1.5 per cent of GDP surplus despite terms of trade that were  40 per cent lower than last year with unemployment at five per cent more or less, where the Government  achieved - if that’s the right word - a three per cent of GDP deficit. So, this is a government which is  consistently getting the fiscal decisions wrong.

QUESTION:

Given these are decisions that would have to be legislated - I’m presuming the company tax one might have  to be legislated, you’re going to go into Parliament and you’re going to have to be making a choice between  letting things through or not letting things through because of their impact on families or business, versus  what the bottom line of the budget is. You don’t have an opportunity to sort of have alternative measures.  Which one will come first?

JOE HOCKEY:

Well, hang on. I think we need to actually find out what the implications are of a number of these decisions.  I mean you know, even just standing here, you can think of those people that have lumpy cash flows who are  going to end up - how they are going to assume what the monthly payment will be. Currently with Pay As  You Go with employees who look at previous years’ income - in this situation it will be a very complicated  process.

QUESTION:

Mr Hockey,  much has been made of the timing of MYEFO. In government, would you try and fix MYEFO  so it’s, like, exactly six months after the budget to try and remove….

JOE HOCKEY:

6





Absolutely. It’s got to be of a credible timing. Everyone knows this has been framed to avoid having the  revenue on the mining tax in the budget. I mean, they’ve revised down the revenue, but on the other side of  Canberra, the revenue numbers are actually coming in and I’m prepared to bet they’re a lot less than what’s  in this document.

QUESTION:

[inaudible]

JOE HOCKEY:

Well, we’d be more credible. In the case of Peter Costello, he actually held most of his MYEFOs in  December, which was the original intent. The only time it ever came to October was when there was an  inevitable election in the next month or two. So this bring-forward can only be looked at through cynical  glasses.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, one of the allocations is $200,000 for opposition leader and minority party leader to spend on  travel overseas. Is that something you’d be prepared to give up?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, look, this is a decision which the Government made quite some time ago as I understand it. It’s not  additional spending as I understand it. It’s a change in the way the money is spent. Previously, as I  understand it, money has come out of the budgets of individual missions overseas and now it’s coming out  of its own allocation. Michelle?

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, can I ask you a question about the Nielsen poll today?

TONY ABBOTT:

Sure.

QUESTION:

In that poll, 42 per cent thought you were sexist. Why do you think this is?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I’m going to leave others to ponder these matters, but I simply deny utterly that claim and I don’t think  anyone who knows me would think that that particular claim was sustainable and Bill Shorten, I think, has  said that it’s not a sustainable claim, Mark Butler has said that it’s not a sustainable claim…

JOE HOCKEY:

Tony Burke on TV with me.

TONY ABBOTT:

7



...Tony Burke said it was not a sustainable claim. So, the real story here is the split in the ranks of the  Government. You’ve got the Prime Minister and some making what is frankly an outrageous and  unsustainable claim and you’ve got others saying look this is absolute nonsense.

QUESTION:

This is the community you’re dealing with here.

TONY ABBOTT:

As I said, I will leave others to ponder the reasons for it but I think what we’ve seen over the last few  months is hyperventilating from the Government making claims which simply don’t stand up to serious  scrutiny.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, in MYEFO, the penalty for scrapping the NBN is now $2.8 billion. Is that money well spent, to  scrap the NBN, do you think?

TONY ABBOTT:

Let’s look at what the NBN’s achieved so far. It’s been going for five years and they’ve got 6,500 live fibre  connections. Now, plainly this isn’t working out. It’s over budget and it’s behind schedule and they  constantly keep revising down their forecasts for achievements. This is an utterly underperforming entity  and I think that the more we see of this the more it looks like a massive white elephant; school halls on  steroids as I’ve been saying since before the last election.

QUESTION:

Mr Hockey, can I just ask, in terms of the comments you’ve made in the past on welfare and entitlements,  don’t things like the wind-back of the baby bonus actually support your politics? Why would you go against  them in Parliament?

JOE HOCKEY:

Well, can I just say this, why are they discriminating against families that are bigger? I mean, you know, the  costs of anesthetists and so many other things are pretty consistent whether it’s a first child, a second child  or a third child and if this is part of their social engineering, why haven’t they talked about it previously? I  need to look at these things together with Tony and our colleagues on a whole-of-government basis.  Families are under pressure. This is attacking families but pretending not to. Of course it attacks families. It  reduces the amount of money. I mean, the concept of "one for mum, one for Dad and one for Australia" is  not part of the lexicon of the Government because now they’re saying that if you have a second or a third  child or more, then you’ll be worse off than you were today.

QUESTION:

Gentlemen, how is this going to affect Aboriginal people in the bush like, you know, Aboriginal people  watching this now? I mean, you’ve talked about the business community and all this kind of stuff, but  what’s your message to those people out there watching this now who may be confused by this today?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, our overall message is that this is a government which is hurting your family’s budget to patch up its  own budget. Now, there’s little in this that is specific to indigenous programmes but it helps indigenous

8



people as it helps Australians generally if we have a growing economy because a growing economy  produces higher wages, it produces more jobs and, in the end, as Noel Pearson keeps saying, it is a strong  economy and strong participation in a strong economy which is going to be the long term salvation of the  indigenous people of Australia. But, as I said, this is not a document which has been focusing on indigenous  policy.

QUESTION:

On the A.C.T election, do you expect the A.C.T Greens to back the Liberals?

TONY ABBOTT:

I expect the ALP and the Greens to accept that there has been a seven per cent swing to the Liberals and the  Liberals are now the largest party in the Assembly. I think that the message of the electorate should be  heeded and if instead of heeding the electorate the Greens and the ALP do another deal with each other, I  think the message that will go forward is that the Greens and the Labor Party are opposite sides of the same  coin and I think Labor voters are going to ask themselves what’s the point of voting Labor if we’re just  going to get Green policies and Green voters will say what’s the point of voting Green if, come what may,  we’re just going to get bad Labor governments?

Thank you.
