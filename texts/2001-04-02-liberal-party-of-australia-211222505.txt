Search for Immigration Facility Sites Begins MPS 37/2001

The Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs is about to begin identifying appropriate sites for new immigration detention facilities in Darwin and Brisbane.

The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock said today that a call for expressions of interest in the design of the new facilities will be made soon.

"I have sent letters to local stakeholders to inform them we are about to start looking at possible sites for these facilities, which were announced in Budget 2000," Mr Ruddock said.

"We will soon be calling for expressions of interest from architectural firms to compete in a select competition to design the new facilities which will include medium security fencing.

"In Budget 2000 I announced the establishment of a 500 bed facility in Darwin to be used primarily for unauthorised boat arrivals.

"The Darwin facility will feature "surge capacity" to handle up to 2,000 people, should this be needed.

"This will allow us to cope with large influxes such as the one we experienced in 1999 -2000.

"I also announced the development of a 200 bed facility in Brisbane, which will have capacity to expand to approximately 550 beds if required. This facility will mainly accommodate unauthorised air arrivals and overstayers.

"In keeping with the Government's policy on property ownership, the construction of the new facilities will be undertaken by the private sector, with the centres being leased back to the Government.

"This will provide a welcome boost in local job opportunities in Darwin and Brisbane," Mr Ruddock said.

It is expected that these facilities will be operational by mid-2003.
