TRANSCRIPT  15 August 2012  Interview with Sabra Lane  ABC AM



Topic: Asylum Seekers

TONY EASTLEY:      The Home Affairs Minister Jason Clare has confirmed  that a captain of a car-carrier that rescued 67 asylum  seekers earlier this week abandoned his planned journey  to Singapore and headed instead for Christmas Island  because he feared for his crew's safety.

The Minister says the captain became concerned as the  asylum seekers became agitated when they discovered  the ship was headed for Singapore.

Mr Clare has spoken to our chief political correspondent  Sabra Lane about that, and the reconnaissance teams  heading for Nauru and PNG today.

JASON CLARE:         Weâ€™ve brought the reconnaissance team forward by one  day. They'll leave Australia this morning; they'll arrive in  Manus Island later today and then Nauru I understand  tomorrow.

They're job is to identify how to set up those facilities and  how quickly they can be done. The Prime Minister has  made the point that this needs to be weeks, not months.  We want to be processing people on Nauru within a  month.

SABRA LANE:           There are reports in the West Australian this morning  that the captain of the car carrier that picked up 67  asylum seekers earlier this week originally planned to

Singapore with them, but he had to turn the boat around  and head for Christmas Island because the asylum  seekers became agitated when they were learning that  they were going to Singapore.

What can you tell us about this?

JASON CLARE:         That's right. This all happened on Tuesday. We had a  call from a vessel in distress off the coast of Indonesia.  The Australian Maritime Safety Authority put out a call to  merchant vessels in the area. A merchant vessel arrived,  picked up 67 asylum seekers, then began a journey to  Singapore - its destination.

When the asylum seekers on the boat found out about  this, they became very aggressive and the master of the  ship made the decision to turn the vessel around and  head to Christmas Island.

SABRA LANE:           When they became aggressive, have you been told  exactly what they were doing? Did the captain call  Australia and tell Australia of his intentions to turn the  boat around?

JASON CLARE:         The captain did. The captain rang the Australian  Maritime Safety Authority to tell him of his intentions and  he made the point that he was concerned for his crew's  safety and therefore decided to take the ship to  Christmas Island.

They arrived on Tuesday night. Now that means that the  people that were on this boat now face the prospect, like  other people that arrive in Australia from now on, of being  transferred to Nauru or to Manus Island.

SABRA LANE:             This agitation. Did they threaten the crew?

JASON CLARE:         I don't have those specific details. We'll need to talk to  the master of the ship about exactly what happened.  What we do know is that the master of the ship contacted  Australian authorities said that he was concerned for the  safety of his crew and on that basis made the decision to  take the asylum seekers to Christmas Island.

SABRA LANE:             Does it worry you that that happened?

JASON CLARE:         It does. It shows you just how dangerous it can be out on  the high seas when you've got desperate people doing  dangerous things, and that's what happened here. It tells

you how dangerous potentially towing a boat back to  Indonesia can be as well, when people behave like this.

But there's no advantage in that sort of behaviour.  There's no advantage in it because these people now  face the prospect of going to Nauru.

SABRA LANE:           The car-carrier's owned by the same company that  owned the Tampa.

JASON CLARE:         Yes and there's another point worth making here, Sabra.  Next week's the 11th anniversary of the Tampa.

Politicians here have been fighting about this now for 11  years. We've been fighting about it for too long and  hopefully today we'll have legislation passed through the  Senate and we can end this debate once and for all.

SABRA LANE:           The UNHCR representative to this region is very  concerned about this new measure that some people  may be held on Nauru and Manus Island indefinitely,  without processing.

And he says that Australia risks breaching its  international obligations.

JASON CLARE:         This is a wretched area of public policy, there's no easy  choices here. What's this all about? It's about trying to  make sure that people don't come to Australia by boat  because they think it's the fastest way to get here.

That's why compassionate people like Angus Houston,  Paris Aristotle and Michael L'Estrange have established  this principle of no advantage, so that if you come to  Australia by boat, you won't be processed any quicker,  you won't be able to get to Australia any quicker than if  you went through the UN in Jakarta.

It's very tough. That's right, but it's about trying to make  sure that people don't have the incentive to pay a people  smuggler $10,000 to get on a boat to come to Australia.

SABRA LANE:           On the missing boat that set sail for Australia in late  June, Fairfax reports this morning that the Palestinian  representative to Australia, his office, contacted the  Federal Government three weeks ago with his concerns  and he says that the Government did nothing and nothing  happened.

Is that right?

JASON CLARE:         I can confirm some information for you and talk to you  about what government authorities know. I was first  informed of this on Thursday last week through a call that  we received from the West Australian newspaper who'd  been in contact with the Palestinian community in  Australia.

The Australian Maritime Safety Authority have said in the  newspaper today that they never received a distress call  about this vessel and that no search and rescue for this  boat ever occurred.

The best information that we've got is that the boat set  sea on the 29th of June and was never heard from since.

It wouldn't surprise me if concerned members of the  Australian community contacted a range of different  government departments over that time from the 29th of  June till now. Whether that's Immigration, the Maritime  Safety Authority or my own agency, Customs and  Boarder Protection, and I'll go back and do more work to  find out when those calls first occurred.

TONY EASTLEY:      The Home Affairs Minister Jason Clare speaking to chief  political correspondent, Sabra Lane.
