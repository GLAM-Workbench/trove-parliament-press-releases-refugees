VESSEL INTERCEPTED BY BORDER PROTECTION COMMAND

6 April 2010

HMAS Childers operating under the control of Border Protection Command successfully  intercepted a suspected irregular entry vessel last night, near West Island at Ashmore Reef.

Initial indications suggest 22 passengers and one crew member are on board the vessel.

The Australian Government remains committed to protecting the Australian border from  maritime threats, including people smuggling. People smuggling is a global and regional  problem and the Australian Government continues to work closely with our regional  neighbours to address this issue.

People smugglers seek out and exploit vulnerable persons who, having faced uncertainty,  conflict and violence, pursue stability and safety.

The Australian Government has committed more than $654 million to implement a  comprehensive people smuggling strategy to combat this issue with an expanded presence in  the region by the Australian Federal Police, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the  Department of Immigration and Citizenship and the Australian Customs and Border  Protection Service.

The Australian Federal Police continue to provide support to foreign law enforcement  agencies in their efforts to detect and disrupt people smuggling activities in the region.

Close working relationships with regional neighbours such as Indonesia, Malaysia and Sri  Lanka have resulted in a number of arrests and disruptions to people smuggling ventures.

People who are owed Australiaâ€™s protection under our international obligations will be  granted that protection. Those who seek to exploit and put lives at risk through people  smuggling will face the full consequence of the law.

The group will be transferred to Christmas Island for security, identity and health checks, and  their reasons for travel will be established.
