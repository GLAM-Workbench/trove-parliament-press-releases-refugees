PRESS RELEASE

Minister for Justice  The Hoo. Duncan Kerr MP

An officer from the Australian Federal Police is to join the United Nations peace-keeping  force in Somalia, the Federal Minister for Justice, Duncan Kerr, said today.

Mr Kerr said that Superintendent Barry Carpenter had recently completed a three-year  secondment with the United Nations Border Relief Operation (UNBRO) on the Thai " Cambodian border.

"His innovative and resourceful approach during that time has reflected magnificently on  both himself and the Australian Federal Police," Mr Kerr said.

"Superintendent Carpenter worked in a refugee camp of more than 200,000 displaced  Cambodians where he recruited and trained a police force of 3000, wrote a criminal code and  established a court system," Mr Kerr said.

"So successful has his work been that at the request of the United Nations, Superintendent  Carpenter has been further seconded to enable him to take up the position of senior police  adviser to the United Nations operation in Somalia under U .S. Admiral Howell."

Mr Kerr said that of the 11 AFP officers currently in Cambodia, 10 were based at Thmar  Puck in north-west Cambodia. The officer in charge of the contingent, Superintendent Bob  Bradley, was also the UN Transitional Authority (UNT AC) district police commander, with  the Au~tralians working with police from Germany, Algeria, India and France.

''The AFP contingent, which took over from an initial group in January, has continued to  build on the relationship and trust developed by the AFP officers," Mr Kerr said.

''The Australian Ambassador has reported that the Australian police appear to be trusted by  all factions and have established a police training course for four factions.

''The UNT AC force commander has also been quoted as saying that this situation of trust is  unique in Cambodia, and a model he would like to see followed elsewhere."

Mr Kerr said the second contingent was now working towards assisting in the conduct of the  elections, and police patrols of the Thmar Puok district had commenced this week.

'While the officers are concerned about the press coverage of incidents in Cambodia,  particularly from their families' point of view, they have advised the Commissioner of Police  that this has strengthened their commitment to the people of Cambodia, the peace process  and the holding of the elections."
