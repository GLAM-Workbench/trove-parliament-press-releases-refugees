ADDITIONAL ASSISTANCE FOR 
PALESTINIAN REFUGEES

Friday 12 June 1998

Â

I am pleased to announce a number of measures 
to address the relief and development needs   of Palestinian refugees in the Middle East, valued at almost $3.4 
million.

Â

Australia has been providing assistance to the Middle East for many 
years, with our program of assistance for the Palestinian people the 
main focus. As the oldest refugee population in the world, the needs 
of these people are a constant concern for us.

Â

Australia will provide an additional $1 million in 1998 for the work 
of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) which plays an 
important role in providing services to the Palestine refugees in its 
five areas of operation. These funds are intended for the income generation 
activities undertaken by UNRWA as we see these activities as the trend 
of the future in fostering greater self-reliance among the refugee population.

Â

UNRWA has experienced, in the past few years, a series of budget problems 
caused in part by the growth in the refugee population and in part by 
falling donor contributions. Australia has contributed nearly $9 million 
to UNRWA over the last three years.

Â

Mental health is an area too often neglected in conflict zones. Australia 
will provide $342,000 in 1998 for a day care centre for Palestinian 
victims of the   intifada.  The day care centre - an initiative of the Australian 
Red Cross - will help those victims of the violence in the region who 
have suffered psychological trauma to return to society.

Â

Australia will provide an additional $50,000 for the fit out of the 
Forensic Laboratory of the Palestinian Civil Police in Gaza. This will 
enable the provision of a large quantity of technical equipment to be 
provided by another donor and for the laboratory to commence operation. 
This is a very practical example of how Australia can facilitate a good 
outcome by carefully targeting the key constraints to development

Â

Similarly, Australia is soon to begin an agricultural capacity building 
project valued at $2 million over four years. Agricultural development 
is central to the future of the Palestinian people as the mainstay of 
the Palestinian economy. Our focus on strengthening they key Palestinian 
agricultural institutions is expected to act as a catalyst for other 
donors to become involved in the sector.
