Government must halt transfers from  Villawood

The Australian Greens have called on the Government to halt a series of transfers of refugees  who are involved in legal proceedings from the Villawood detention centre following the  Government’s significant data breach in February.

“Moving refugees away from their lawyers the day before their case was due to be heard is  inappropriate and deeply cynical,” the Greens’ immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah  Hanson-Young said.

“They have already cut legal aid funding, but now the Abbott Government is moving refugees  from centre to centre in a bid to keep them from gaining a fair legal hearing.

“Australia was once the country of the fair go, but the treatment these refugees have received is  anything but fair.

“The protesters at the Villawood detention centre today were simply doing what the Government  should be, trying to protect refugees and ensure that they have legal representation.

“The Government must halt these transfers now and give these refugees time to argue their  case in a court of law. Anything less is unacceptable.”
