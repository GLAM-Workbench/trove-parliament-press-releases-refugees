AUSTRALIAN DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE :   MINISTERIAL STATEMENT

The Government remains committed to give practical  effect to Australia's responsibility to assist developing  countries to improve the economic and social conditions of  their people. Australia* s aid program is one important  means of working towards this objective. .  Consistent with

this objective the Government will increase Australia's aid  program for.1976/77 by the greatest amount which can be  reconciled with the constraints imposed by the budgetary  situation. .

The provision for aid in 1976/77 will be $400m. This is an increase of about $49m over expected actual -   expenditure of about $351m, this financial year - an  increase of 14 per cent. Many Australians will regret

that this is not greater. I sha,re this regret. We have '

to realise however that the basis of our development | . assistance is to be found in the stability and growth of  the national economy. The provision of an amount of  $400m under the present ; circumstances demonstrates the

importance with which the Government regards its objective  to assist developing countries. Ã¢ÂÂ   1

MAJOR INITIATIVES :  - ‘  Ã¢ÂÂ   Â·-------- ------ ------ ------ ----------- ------------  |  Ã¢ÂÂ

We have already announced a number of major initÂ­ iatives which to a considerable extent set the framework  of our aid program..

.  I

The first is a five year commitment to Papua New Guinea which guarantees that country at least $180m per  annum.. This base figure will be topped up each year to  take some account of inflationary and other.factors. Over

the five year period commencing in 1976/77 Papua New Guinea  can expect at least $930m. The total direct allocation to  Papua New Guinea will be $190m in 1976/77 and $200rA in  1977/78. Papua New Guinea ministers have publicly .acknowledged

their satisfaction with this pledge and indeed the{Minister  for Finance has held us up, in an international forum, as an

. /2.

example to other donorsÃ¢ÂÂ The firm nature of this pledge  provides a basis for Papua New Guinea* s long term  development planning.

After Papuan New Guinea our prime obligationÂ·., as ,   an aid donor is to our other close neighbour, Indonesia. The  Government has given Indonesia an assurance that Australia  will allocate not less than $86m in aid over the next three

years. This commitment which represents a substantial  increase on the previous pledge of $69m will be reviewed  towards the end of the second year, bearing in mind the  desirability of maintaining its value in real terms and

Indonesia*s traditional share of the Australian aid program.

Australia has also committed itself to contribute  its agreed fair share of $US41.6m to the replenishment of  the Asian Development Fund through which the Asian  Development Bank provides loans on concessional terms to  poorer member countries. In addition we have announced our

full support, in prirticple, for the proposed increase in the  Bank's capital resources to come into effect in the middle  of 1977. Provision will be made in the 1976/77 budget to  honour Australia's pledge of $4m to the "Third Window", a  new lending facility of the World Bank which is designed to  provide additional funds on semi-concessional terms for ,

countries affected by the increase in oil prices and other  developments in the world economy.,The 1976/77 estimates will,  include some $23m for the International Development .  . Association (IDA) which provides concessional finance for

the poorest developing countries.

In addition to the World Bank, the Asian  Development Bank and IDA, Australia also contributes to UN,  Commonwealth and regional agencies.  We will continue to give  our fair share to these programs which play a valuable role  both in assisting development and, in the case of organisations

like the Children's Fund, and the High Commissioner for Â·   Refugees, in providing urgent humanitarian relief as well.

These are major commitments which we must meet;'  but we have also been able to make some increased provision  for other‘facets of our aid program. Our geographical  situation dictates that the,ASEAN members (of which Indonesia

3,

is one) and the South Pacific countries should be the focus of our priorities. Within the total of $400m it will be possible to carry on with all the projects to which we are committed in our bilateral program and to provide a modest

increase,  Australia will continue to provide food aid on a substantial scale and to provide training, in Australia and abroad, for people from developing countries.

We will continue to endeavour, within the priorities  set by recipient countries and within the context of our  policy and funding capacity, to improve the performance and  quality of our aid program. We recognise also the importÂ­ ant role of non government organisations both in undertaking  projects of a type which cannot be handled by government and

in increasing public understanding in Australia of the  development problem. We will continue and increase our  support for these organisations.

.  Australia remains committed to the internationally  accepted target of providing 0.7% of its gross national  product as development assistance. Given Australia's  present economic circumstances it would be inappropriate to

set any date for the achievement of this target. v
