TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP, COMMONWEALTH PARLIAMENT OFFICES,  SYDNEY, 27 SEPTEMBER 2007

E & O E - PROOF ONLY

Subjects:  Burma; ALP Frontbench; Tariffs; Nicole Cornes; Tony  Abbott Remarks; Overseas Trained Doctors

RUDD:  There are further reports of violence in Burma.  I understand  that further monks have been injured or killed.  It’s important for the international  community to unite in their condemnation of the Burmese regime.  These are  unacceptable acts of violence against peaceful protestors, against peaceful  religious protestors.

I repeat what I said the other day.  It is important for Australia to join the  international community in imposing further targeted sanctions against members  of the Burmese regime.

I noticed Mr Downer, the Foreign Minister, said the other day that these sorts of  sanctions were not useful, were not effective.  Labor’s view is they are useful and  they should be adopted, consistent with the call by United States President Bush.

I notice that Mr Downer’s position is in complete conflict with the position  announced by Prime Minister Howard today.  I get the impression that on Burma,  this Government hasn’t worked out whether it’s Arthur or Martha on the question  of how to deal with the human rights challenge.

Mr Downer has been committed, for reasons I don’t understand, to a policy of  human rights constructive engagement with the Burmese regime.  That policy of  constructive engagement with the Burmese regime has conspicuously failed.  It  is a further failure of Howard Government foreign policy and I would call on the

Howard Government, including its Foreign Minister, to fully embrace the call by  President Bush that the international community unite in a program of targeted  sanctions, targeted sanctions both in terms of travel and in terms of financial  transactions on individual members of the Burmese regime.

When it comes to Burma and the abuse of human rights, the international  community, including Australia, must speak with one strong, united voice.

On another matter, I’ve noticed that Mr Howard today has continued and  expanded his negative campaign against Labor and made references to Labor’s

team because Mr Howard does not want to debate plans for Australia’s future.  I  don’t intend to allow Mr Howard to distract from the debate on plans for our  country’s future, my plans versus his plans.

That’s why I’m confirming today that if we are elected to form the next  government of Australia, the core members of my economic team will be Wayne  Swan as Treasurer, Lindsay Tanner as Minister for Finance, and Julia Gillard as

Deputy Leader and as Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations.

My team have been performing fantastically over the period that I have been  leader.  When it comes to the rest of the Ministry, I’ll be determining the  composition of the Ministry and its portfolio allocations subsequent to the  election.

I repeat, I have no intention whatsoever of allowing Mr Howard, by continuing  and expanding his negative campaign, to distract from the core debate facing the  country which is my plan for Australia’s future versus what Mr Howard may or  may not have on offer.

My challenge to Mr Howard is this.  When does he intend to hand over the prime  ministership to Mr Costello?  The Australian people have a right to know.  If Mr  Costello then becomes Prime Minister, who will Mr Costello then have as  Treasurer?  Well, Mr Howard has sought clarity on this matter.  I’ve provided

clarity. I ask Mr Howard now to do the same.

Happy to take your questions.

JOURNALIST: Mr Rudd, why did you not yesterday confirm that Wayne  Swan would be your Treasurer?

RUDD:  Well, Mr Howard, today, decided to weigh into this debate  and to extend his negative campaign against Labor’s team.  I don’t intend to  allow him to use that debate to distract us and the country from a core debate  about our plans for the country’s future.

JOURNALIST: You’ve said that Bill Shorten and Greg Combet will be on  your frontbench.  Who would you drop?

RUDD:  I’ve said in the case of those coming into the parliamentary  team that we’d want to see them with a strong role.  And what I’ve also said is  that we’ll be determining the composition of the rest of the Ministry subsequent to  the election based on merit, based on experience and based on the overall  needs of any incoming government, should, of course, we be elected to win the  next election.

JOURNALIST: Will you leave it entirely to the Caucus to nominate who  should be in the ministerial team or will you express an opinion after the election,  if you win, on who should be on the frontbench?

RUDD:  Let me be very clear about this.  I’ll be determining the  composition of the Labor Ministry should we be elected to form the next  government of the country.

JOURNALIST: So, don’t you risk propelling the Prime Minister’s accusations  of hubris and getting ahead of yourselves by discussion of these frontbench  positions now?

RUDD:                        Mr Howard engaged in this debate today and therefore I  don’t intend to allow Mr Howard to enable us to be distracted from the core  debate for the country’s future.  And that core debate for the country’s future  concerns my plans to keep the economy strong, my plans for an education  revolution, my plans on health and hospitals, my plans on climate change and  water, my plans also when it comes to restoring fairness and balance to the  workplace.  Therefore I want to make sure that this election campaign is about

his policies versus mine and on the question of the outcome of the election, I  know winning 16 seats is like climbing Mt Everest.  I know we have only won  twice from Opposition since World War II, and I know that I’m up against a very  clever and very cunning politician and this is going to be hard as hell trying to win  this election.  But I’ve decided to add clarity to this debate for reasons I’ve just  outlined.

JOURNALIST:           Would Wayne Swan make a better Treasurer than Julia  Gillard?

RUDD:                        Wayne Swan has been performing fantastically as a  Shadow Treasurer and will be a first class Treasurer of the Commonwealth.   Lindsay Tanner, similarly, has been doing a first class job as Shadow Minister for  Finance.  Look at the work he’s done already in terms of identifying savings.   Julia Gillard, as Deputy Leader, and as Minister for Employment and Industrial  Relations, will have a huge job to undertake which is to bed down the  implementation of a new industrial relations law for Australia which restores  balance and fairness to the workplaces of this country.  These will form the core  members of Labor’s economic team.

JOURNALIST:           Is there an argument for Mr Combet and Mr Shorten to go  straight on to the front bench?

RUDD:                        I believe that Parliamentary experience is important.  I also  believe that the overall balance of the arguments of merit, of experience and the  overall needs of an incoming government are important but I’ll make that

determination subsequent to an election should Labor win the next election and  that’s going to be a very difficult challenge.

JOURNALIST:           Would you expect to bring Parliament back if you are  elected this year?

RUDD:                        Look, the challenge ahead is to put forward our plans for  Australia’s future and to argue our case and then submit it to the ballot box and  allow the Australian people to decide.  That’s what I’m concerned about.  Matters  subsequent to that we should leave until the people exercise their choice.

JOURNALIST:           Do you want to bring forward a review of the TCF sector  and do you want tariffs to be part of that review?

RUDD:                        What I’ve already indicated, consistent with positions I’ve  taken in the past, is that Labor does not embrace protectionism.  Labor has  always indicated that there would be a review when it comes to the existing TCF  tariff regime and we haven’t changed our position on that one bit.

JOURNALIST:           Regarding Nicole Cornes, was the electorate insulted when  she deals with the question the way that she did yesterday?

RUDD:                        My experience of Nicole on the ground is that when it  comes to her explaining our position to working families about cost of living  pressures, about the challenges on the ground and the communities in Boothby,  that she’s doing a first class job.  Look, everyone, when they’re confronted with  interviews, is going to have good interviews and bad interviews.  I understand  that.  Every candidate around the country understands that and I think Nicole has  displayed great guts and determination in getting out there and putting Labor’s  message out to the community.

JOURNALIST:           Tony Abbott appears to be trying to make the problems out  at Sydney’s Royal North Shore Hospital into a federal election issue.  Today he’s  come out and said that (inaudible) don’t vote for Labor because Labor’s created  the problem and he thinks that Federal Labor would just make the problem  worse.  Is this a topic you’d argue (inaudible)?

RUDD:                        A miscarriage is a tragedy for any family and a miscarriage  is a tragedy for this family, and I extend our thoughts to the Horska family  because of what they have just gone through.  I also note that the NSW  Government has indicated there will be an external inquiry as to what has  happened here.  I think we should all await the outcome of that inquiry to decide  what in fact has happened.  Mr Howard, in my experience on these matters, is a  decent man.  I’d ask him to reflect very carefully on this what Mr Abbott has said  and to take appropriate action.

JOURNALIST:           What is that action?  What would be appropriate?

RUDD:                        I would, as I said on these sorts of matters, I’ve always  found Mr Howard to be a decent man and I’d ask him to look carefully at what Mr  Abbott’s has said and to speak to Mr Abbott about his remarks.

JOURNALIST:           Is he trying to exploit the situation politically?

RUDD:                        I would, I think the Australian people will reach their own  conclusions on that.  I think when it comes to a family tragedy like this, our hearts  go out to the family.  These sorts of experiences are very personal and tragic and  I think it’s important that Mr Howard look carefully at what Mr Abbott has said.

JOURNALIST: Do you think they were insensitive remarks from Mr Abbott?

RUDD:  I think when you’re dealing with individual human tragedies, it’s  very important that the respect for the family concerned takes first place, and I would  ask Mr Howard to look very carefully at what Mr Abbott has said and form his own  judgement about whether those remarks are appropriate.

JOURNALIST: Just on another thing, apparently it’s been revealed today that  five Papuan asylum seekers were deported back to their countries after (inaudible)  the Torres Strait.  Do you support that method?

RUDD:  I have not seen that report.  I’d wait to be fully briefed on it  before making a substantive comment.  Last questions?

JOURNALIST: About that hospital case, Mr Abbott is right, though, in saying  this is a State problem and that the Federal Government does give so much money  to State Labor.  Surely some of the blame should be placed there?

RUDD:  Look, on the question of the individual circumstances  surrounding this tragedy, there’s an external inquiry which has been commissioned,  that’s appropriate.  I would think Mr Howard, who I believe to be a decent man,  should reflect on what Mr Abbott has said today.  There’s a stark contrast between  what Mr Howard has said and what Mr Abbott has said.

JOURNALIST: There’s another report out today, Sir.  Kevin Andrews has  written to the State medical authorities questioning their capacity to adequately vet  visiting overseas doctors.  It relates back to the Haneef case, a colleague of his.  Do  you think the States are doing well enough in this area or is it something the Feds  should take over?

RUDD:  I would think that Mr Andrews should reflect first on his own role  in recent events on this particular case and reflect long and hard on his own role, on  this particular case.



On the question of State vetting, I’ll leave it to my colleague, the Shadow Minister for  Immigration, to make a substantive reply to that.

Thanks very much.
