100 days, 40 failures: a preview of secretive, cruel and chaotic government

Releasing a list of the Abbott government’s top failures, the Australian Greens say the first 100  days have been a secretive, cruel and chaotic preview of what is to come.

“During the election campaign the Abbott government’s true agenda was hidden behind cheap  rhetoric, but you can’t run a country with a slogan,” said Australian Greens Leader Christine  Milne.

“The Abbott government has tried to claim a so-called mandate to take Australia back to the last  century, but he doesn’t have one.

“The longer Prime Minister Abbott and his big business mates run the show, the less the public  knows about what’s going on behind the scenes. The Abbott government is a secretive, cruel  and chaotic government.

“The Australian people didn’t sign up to this, and the Greens will stand against it.

“This secretive, cruel and chaotic preview of what is to come has motivated and focussed the  Greens to defend action on global warming and to care for the people the Abbott government  will ignore.”

In PM Tony Abbott’s first 100 days he has:

Ã¯ÂÂ· Continued his campaign to roll back action on global warming  Ã¯ÂÂ· Begun a harsh campaign of cuts to health, education and community services  Ã¯ÂÂ· Increased secrecy and cruelty towards vulnerable people seeking asylum  Ã¯ÂÂ· Undermined attempts to address discrimination in society regarding sexuality and

race

Ã¯ÂÂ· Demonstrated that big business and mining interests will be put ahead of  communities and the environment under the Coalition government
