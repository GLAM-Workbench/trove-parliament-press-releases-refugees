INTERVIEW WITH KIERAN GILBERT

SKY NEWS AM AGENDA

16 FEBRUARY 2011



SUBJECTS: Funerals of Asylum Seekers, MRRT revenue

KIERAN GILBERT:

Thanks for being with us this morning on AM Agenda. Joining me now  from the Sky News Centre, I have the Parliamentary Secretary to the  Treasurer, David Bradbury. David, good morning.

DAVID BRADBURY:

Good morning Kieran.

GILBERT:

And from Melbourne we've got the Shadow Small Business Minister Bruce  Billson. Bruce, good morning to you.

BRUCE BILLSON:

Hello to you, Kieran and David.

GILBERT:

Bruce I want to ask you first of all, Scott Morrison said it was not a  reasonable cost for the Government to fly 21 relatives of the Asylum  Seeker victims for the funerals yesterday in Sydney, to fly them from  Christmas Island to Sydney. What is your view?

BILLSON:

Of course those family members should be at that very difficult service,  the laying to rest of their loved ones, an incredibly important part of  peoples lives, those near and dear want to be apart of that moment of  great grieving and commemoration and having family members there is  appropriate. I think Scott's point is that we're unclear about why the

decision was made for the funeral services to be held in Sydney, I think  that's a reasonable question to ask, but we'll all learn more next week in  Senate Estimates when the decision making process will hopefully be a  little more illuminated. May I extend my condolences to the families of  those who lost their lives in that tragic event.

GILBERT:

Joe Hockey made a very, you know, differentiated himself quite clearly  from the comments of Scott Morrison, he said "no matter what the faith  or colour of the skin of a person, they have every right to say goodbye",  so there was clearly a division there on a very sensitive day, a day the  funerals were being held. Do you think it was appropriate for Scott  Morrison to be making those comments yesterday?

BILLSON:

I'm not sure the division's quite as some would portray it. I think the  issue of the families coming together for this extraordinarily difficult  moment, the grieving, the loss, the laying to rest of the remains of  someone very dear and immediate family members. I don't think there is  an issue there about that being an occasion that should be attended by  family members. I think Scott was making a point about it was unclear  why that coming together, that occasion, was in Sydney. This highlights  the enormous tragedy of people making these very dangerous journeys to  Australia which is why we need to get this policy area right…

GILBERT:

Bruce, should he have made the point yesterday, on the day of the  funerals though?

BILLSON:

Are you talking about Joe or Scott?

GILBERT:

Scott Morrison suggesting that the funerals could have been held  elsewhere, was it the appropriate day to be making that point, on the day  these people were being buried?

BILLSON:

I think yesterday was a day of reflection and commemoration and the loss  of life is invariably the focus we should all be giving and the issues around  the decision making process we can canvas in Senate Estimates next  week.

GILBERT:

So you're saying it wasn't good timing for Scott Morrison to be making  those points?

BILLSON:

Well the opportunity for those decisions to be examined presents itself  next week. Our thoughts and prayers are with those families of loved  ones who lost their lives and that is the way it should be.

GILBERT:

David Bradbury, the Prime Minister was asked about it yesterday, there  have been reports today that it took a bit of time for her to find her voice  on this, saying that she was asked about it initially and she said that it  was a matter for Ministers at home.

BRADBURY:

Well I don't know about those reports but I think the facts are pretty  simple and that is the Government has taken a course of action in this  particular area, and we saw what happened yesterday when Mr Morrison  came out and tried to make a political point around it. I just want to put  on record that I think that the comments that we've heard from Bruce  today are very decent, sensible comments and I think that they very  much reflect the comments that Joe Hockey made yesterday. But the  point that I would be making is that sure, Scott Morrison went out, clearly  this was an overreach, it was an insensitive thing to do, I think it was a  shameful low. But, that was one thing. But when Tony Abbott was given  the opportunity to pull him into line and to acknowledge that this had  been an overreach, and to make some of the sensible points that Joe  Hockey made and that Bruce has made here today, he refused to do that.  It's okay for Bruce to say that there is no division within the Liberal party.  I have not seen such a clear cleavage within the Liberal Party on a  philosophical issue in a long time. I've got to say, that there is now a very  clear choice within the Liberal Party on these matters. You've got the  Hockey view, which says that there should be a more moderate approach  to these matters, and then there is the Abbott view which we've seen  through revelations in The Australian today, but in large part is a position  which has been outsourced to a vicious and virulent email campaign that  has been mounted by various elements within One Nation. Frankly, I  think that the divisions within the Liberal Party have never been greater  and Joe Hockey was right to do what he did yesterday, Bruce Billson is  right to do what he has done this morning, but frankly Tony Abbott needs  to come forward and to distance himself from those comments and to  make it clear that he is not going to take the One Nation approach to this  issue, that he is going to ensure that a little bit of decency is preserved in

this debate. For goodness sake, we had funerals going on yesterday, to  make the sorts of comments that we saw from Scott Morrison and backed  up by Tony Abbott was frankly just callus.

GILBERT:

Bruce Billson, David Bradbury refers to a One Nation approach, but one of  your own former Liberal colleagues, Bruce Baird, the predecessor for  Scott Morrison in the seat of Cook says that he's worried about a lurch to  the right that reflects the Tea Party movement in the United States, what  do you make of that?

BILLSON:

We can offer comments on comments and have an analysis full of  commentary. The circumstances of this tragic loss were stark, vivid, they  moved everybody to see that ship thrown against the shore line at  Christmas Island was a terrible and tragic reminder that we have a policy  challenge here. There are 6200 people in detention centres, policy failures  with boat arrivals, people taking these extraordinarily dangerous journeys  to come to Australia. We can have a commentary about timing of this  particular issue, but it's a small part, an important part, but a small part  of a much broader policy challenge the nation faces and I wish David and  his colleagues would put as much energy into examining the border  protection policy failures as they are trying to insight conflict within the  Liberal party about the tragic events of the last few days.

BRADBURY:

I've got to say Bruce, that I'm not trying to incite anything. I think Joe  Hockey came forward and made his comments very plainly and very  clearly and as I said I do applaud you for standing up and showing the  courage of your convictions on this issue. But frankly, you made the point  about the tragedy that we've seen, and I want to put on record that I  actually think that the way the Opposition conducted themselves around  the time of that tragedy was entirely appropriate. But what I can't  understand is why we find ourselves now in a situation, on a day that  some of the bodies of these people are being buried, that we have the  sorts of insensitive and inflammatory comments that we saw from Scott  Morrison and backed up by Tony Abbott, you know, I think that it was a  shameful low, and frankly I think that the people in the Liberal Party that  have been courageous enough to stand up on this should be applauded  but they must be very concerned about the direction that their party is  heading in.

GILBERT:

Well we've covered this story substantially now, lets move on to the  mining tax. David Bradbury the Treasury forecasts have only just been  released over the last couple of days. Up until now we've only had a  sense of what the first two years will generate, now over the ten year  period, it's going to be $60 billion less than the original mining tax was  going to generate, so this has been one hell of a compromise.

BRADBURY:

Well we have always said that there would be revenue implications from  the agreement that had been entered into when we put forward the  compromise arrangement that involved the Mineral Resource Rent Tax….

GILBERT:

They're big implications though, $60 billion...

BRADBURY:

They are big implications but I simply make this point, that I have seen  some of the commentary that's being made and in particular the  criticisms being brought forward by the Liberal Party and frankly it's left  me scratching my head. In the first instance, we were told that this is a  "great big new tax" that had to be defended and fought against and the  Coalition went to the hilt on this. Now the criticism that we've seen  coming forward from the Opposition is that, well it was a 'great big new  tax, but it's not as big as we thought it was going to be'. Now, what sort  of criticism is that? It's either a big tax, or it's too big or it's too small.  The reality remains that we are committed to delivering real  improvements as a result of the introduction of this new tax and the  improvements that we will deliver will be reductions in company tax, we  will be boosting retirement savings and we will be delivering  improvements in infrastructure. The point remains, that had the Liberal  Party got their way, had they been elected, there would be no such tax  and…

GILBERT:

Doesn't this diminish the prospect for reform, how can you deliver  everything you said that was tied to the mining tax when it's going to be  such a short fall in revenue generated?

BRADBURY:

Well the commitments we have made, we will deliver. In terms of the  mathematics of the funding, we have taken these matters into account  and the various so-called revelations we've been saying made in the  papers today, are matters that have been factored into Government

decision making from the time that decision has been taken. I make the  point that it seems to me rather hypocritical on the one hand for the  Liberal Party to be saying "this is a great big new tax" but then on the  other hand to say that it's not nearly big enough.

GILBERT:

Okay let's hear what Bruce has to say about this. Bruce, these forecasts  from the Treasury suggest that the projected revenue from the mining tax  is going to be $60 billion less than the original plan.

BILLSON:

Yeah and people have to be concerned about that forecast from Treasury.  It follows a series of forecasts from private sector analysts saying that the  numbers on which the Government was basing its claim were incredibly  shaky. You've just heard the Government say that they've spent the  money from the mining tax, this cobbled together policy flawed idea of a  mining tax that has lurched around and can't even be described and the  details aren't known, yet we know that the revenue is just not going to be  there, that the Government has already spent. This underlines the  vulnerability of the budget position where this Gillard Labor Government  and its predecessor Labor Government, have so created a structural  deficit in our finances, there is an enormous hole about the revenue  requirements into the future where Governments making spending  commitments beyond the forward estimates and even within the forward  estimates are not backed up by revenue. So we're going to see debt and  deficit, the Government spending like there's no tomorrow, without any  plan for actually financing the spending. They need to get rid of the  mining tax, it was flawed in it's design to begin with, the Government  conceding that itself by the changes, now the amount of revenue it's  bringing in is not within a bull's roar of what was promised and the  Government has already spent that money, that's not there. People  should be concerned about the underlying structural deficit that this  crowd is embedding in our budget for decades to come and be very  concerned about the trajectory of our nation's finances.

BRADBURY:

Well that's simply not true.

GILBERT:

But David you've still got a stink with the mining companies over the  royalties regime as well where the States are reimbursed.

BRADBURY:

And Kieran we continue to work through those issues. For Bruce to say  that that money has already been spent firstly is a dishonest thing to  say…

BILLSON:

You said it yourself David, you rattled off all the areas where you were  spending the money.

BRADBURY:

Bruce, we have announced the areas where we will be implementing a  range of structural changes that, in the long term, will be a national  benefit.

BILLSON:

That's called spending. Spending the money that's not there.

BRADBURY:

The money hasn't been spent…

BILLSON:

You've made announcements, you've told everybody on this show where  all this money is going that's not there.

BRADBURY:

The money hasn't been spent. The second point that Bruce made is he  talks about how spending decisions have been taken in relation to matters  that are beyond the forward estimates. Well, I thought that was the  height of hypocrisy given the so-called spending cuts or spending  deferrals that we saw from the Opposition just a week or two ago, when  their way of restoring some sort of structural integrity to the budget was  to defer spending decisions beyond the forward estimates. The reality is,  when it comes to the Mineral Resources Rent Tax, we are using this new  taxation approach to ensure that we are securing a reasonable return to  tax payers for the exploitation of natural resources, to deliver sensible  long term benefits for the Australian people. More infrastructure, boosting  retirement savings and cutting company tax.

GILBERT:

Gentlemen, David Bradbury Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer and  Bruce Billson Shadow Minister for Small Business, thanks so much for the  discussion, we'll catch you soon.

BRADBURY:

Thanks Kieran.

BILLSON:

Thank you.
