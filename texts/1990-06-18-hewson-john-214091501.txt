DR JOHN HEWSON, HP  LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION  500 CLUB ADDRESS - SYDNEY  MONDAY 18 JUNE 1990

Thank you very much Peter for the kind words of introduction.   I don't have the same memory that you do of that flight but we  will talk about the detail later.

I thought I would try and do two things today, if I can, firstly  I will report on what we have done since I assumed the Leadership  after the last election.  I feel very strongly that I should do  that because most of the people in this room are our supporters  and without the 500 Club we wouldn't function.  It is by way of  saying thanks and by way of stewardship that I think I should  report on that. .

Secondly, I thought I'd comment on a few current issues - the  performance of the Hawke/Keating Government if you like so far  in this their fourth term.

Well what we have done is a whole string of changes which have  probably been the most significant changes to the structure and  organisation of the Liberal Party in decades.  We started from  ^cratch. I was elected, of course, to put a broom through the  Parliamentary Party and its procedures and that's exactly what

I've done.  Some of it we have announced and some of it will be  announced in due course but having won the Leadership without  owing anybody anything I was in the unique position of being  able to restructure the Shadow Ministry to renegotiate a

Coalition agreement and review Party procedures and policies and  processes without any constraints. That has basically been my  task for the last eighty odd days.

I wanted to put on record, however,  that nobody should be in any  doubt as to the tremendous contribution that Andrew Peacock made  to the Liberal Party in the last election, and in the run up to  the last election. It is very easy to blame those in the past,  Andrew knew that he started behind in that election, well behind,  but to my mind he ran a flawless campaign aind he took more shit  off the media and other parts of this country than I've ever seen  and he stood there,  took it, and delivered more day after day,  and I think it should go down in the record that he gave us every

chance to win and in the end we only lost by a few thousand votes  across half a dozen seats. He in fact and you shouldn't forget  this got more people to vote for him as Prime Minister than Bob

Hawke did by a very significant margin.

I'd also say to you that the aftermath of the election has really  been a bit of a shock to the ALP where we won nine seats and ,

as you know, was a combination of the pathetic performance of the  ALP in Victoria at the National level and the sustained ineptness  of the Cain Government at the State level. The issue of

membership of the ALP in victoria is now a very real one. Indeed  people are trying to resign from the ALP, I'm told, as I've seen  several newspaper reports.  The concern is so great in the ALP  that they have now embarked on a formal campaign to try and shore  up membership and they've developed a three part strategy to  build membership in Victoria. If as a Party member you can find

somebody who will join the ALP then they will remit your fees for  one year. If you can find two people who will join the ALP, and  that's not easy, they will allow you to resign quietly from the  ALP and if you can find three people you will get a personal

letter from Bob Hawke saying that you never were a member of the  ALP.

If you look at their performance in recent days you can see why  there is that sort of pressure. There has been a whole string  of failures and mistakes and ad hocery, if you like, in those  months. We have seen the Tate affair with the Justice Minister  managing to survive in a set of circumstances in which he should

have known better. We have seen Paul Keating attack John Button  in an unprecedented breach of Cabinet solidarity and not to be  criticised or attacked by his Prime Minister. You have seen  Cassandra Walsh telling you know what we told you all the way  through the last election campaign. You've seen Beazley and  Keating making a whole host of what are quite bizarre decisions

in relation to micro reform and industry restructuring and , of  course, in the last week you've seen the Prime Minister take four  or five public positions on the treatment of refugees.

Now all through that period we've just been quietly working away  trying to rebuild ourselves as a Party and we haven't wasted any  time. As I said I renegotiated the Coalition agreement as one

of my first tasks to recognise the significant shift in the  relative strengths of the National Party and the Liberal and to  change the mix of portfolios and other representations of the two  Parties in the Coalition. We are both very happy with the

agreement that we've got. I can tell you that I think it is a

very effective agreement from both points of view.

Secondly, I was able to pick the Shadow Ministry on the basis of  merit, overwhelmingly on the basis of merit, because I was in the  unusual position of being able to put round pegs in round holes

and put people in jobs where they have demonstrated some capacity  or ability to do those jobs. But the basic thrust that I brought  to the Shadow Ministry structure was something that I guess  people in the business community take for granted and that is a  simple managment approach.

3

One of our great failings in the past has been the difficulty we  have had in managing issues or managing our position on

legislation or in managing our response to events as they break  or, indeed, in managing people. So I divided the Shadow Ministry  up into seven management groups, built around what I consider to  be the seven main public policy areas likely to be of importance  over the next three years. And so I have a group on environment

and development for example, I have a group on manpower and  labour market reform, I have a group on industry restructuring,  a group on business and economics, I have a group on foreign  affairs and defence and, of course, a public administration  group.

It helps me manage our positions and policy formulation and  importantly it helps me manage the people involved, each of those  Shadow Ministers, and it also, I think most importantly builds  a basis for team work which we haven't had. People work as part  of a team now in each group, they think as part of a team, they

have to pass their ideas through that team before they go through  the Shadow Ministry and the Party Room for final announcement to  the public. That teamwork, I think, that concept of unity and  teamwork, which is something that eluded on several previous  occasions is going to be fundamental to our success at the next  election. We have also built a link from the Shadow Ministry to  the back bench, we have back bench task forces that match those  Shadow Ministry groups, back benchers shadowing Shadows,  assisting them in both houses in the representation of their  portfolios. It is a much better and much greater back bench

involvement than has ever been the case in the past.

We've also reviewed our whole Parliamentary structure and  procedures of the Parliamentary Party, we had a two day meeting  , *  for that purpose. We reviewed every aspect of that, including  some very sensitive issues which in the past have caused us a lot

of trouble, issues, for example, like discipline and we formally  debated the need for a code of conduct and in the end we decided  not to have a written code of conduct but an unwritten code of  conduct. Through the Party Room procedures we can impose

discipline on each other. That has already been tested in a very  significant way and worked very well in terms of bringing the  particular individual to account.

We've also as a result of that process been able to handle very  difficult issues as a Coalition which in the past may have split  us or caused us, at least, a lot more public embarrassment than  has been the case. Let me site the example of the wool debate  which was handled internally very well. Both Parties, of course,

had people of different views. In the end, I believe, we took  the sensible decision from the point of view of both the nation  and wool growers and we managed to manage that issue through the  Parliamentary process and in public and come out with as I say

the best decision in the interest of both groups. And that I  think is an example of how the changed structure, the managment  structure, the team work approach, the involvement of back bench  and the concept of discipline all came together to make that a

4

very.successful exercise from our point of view and to take the,  what I think, is as I say the sensible decision to be taken.

We've also had a review at the Party organisation level, a two  day conference recently at Sefton in Victoria. Again the whole  process of Party organisation was reviewed. Every element in the  past that has caused us some pain or disunity or disruption has  been on the table and very constructive changes are being made,  particularly, I would emphasise a desire to build a more national  orientation to the Liberal Party than has been a feature in the  past. That is to have a genuine high powered national Liberal  Party Organisation such that we can be an effective campaigning

force and co-ordinated campaigning force at the next election.  If you think back to the disparity in performance between the  State organisations in just the last campaign I think you will  understand the significance of what I mean in aiming for a

national organisation.

Two other things that we've done in recent days which I think  have been very important - one is to embark on a major project  which we are calling "Australia 2000". Trying to get people  involved in the fairly basic exercise of thinking about what sort

of country they would like to build, here in Australia, by the  year 2000. There is far too much focus on the day to day

pressures of politics and political debate. There is far to  little medium term thinking and medium term planning. There is  far too little consideration of medium to long term trends that  are at work in our economy. And so we have embarked on a major  exercise, as I say, to get people to think about the sort of

country they would like to build in the year 2000. what sort of  industrial structure, or economic structure, or political  structure, or cultural structure, or social structure, or  environmental structure and so I could go on. What type of

country we could build or should we aim to build, realistically,  by the year 2000. We are involving everybody from our branch  level right through in this, writing to individual branch members  encouraging Party conferences to work on those issues, going to  have public seminars and so on. We are writing to major business  organisations, community groups, ethnic associations and so I can  go on inviting them all to be part of it. It is not just

rhetoric - it is a major exercise which will be sustained over  the next twelve or eighteen months, trying to delineate a very  clear vision for this country and a clear set of policies against

that vision which will allow the achievement of that vision.

And so I think that will be a very important" feature of what we  do and we have so far had extremely encouraging response to that  sort of objective. In my view Australia can emerge as a major  economic and political force in our region, the Asia/Pacific  region, by the year 2000 and that is generally our objective.

The final thing that we have done in the last few days is to

demonstrate a capacity to raise issues which have in the past  been very difficult for political parties to raise. It comes,  in part, from our approach to "Australia 2000", we think that  will help us in raising these issues. But also in recognition

5

of the very difficult circumstances in which this country  presently exists. There should be no sacred cows. All issues  should be up for review and I feel very strongly that issues like  immigration, for example, should be the subject of public debate,  rational mature public debate, without running off at the mouth

on issues like race but be able to get down to the detail of the  size of the immigration intake and in due course, of course, the  extent to which that is skill based or family reunion based or  whatever.

Similarly issues like the consumption tax, which have only been  off the agenda in the past through a lack of political will.  They have got to be on the agenda if they will bring the benefits  to savings and national productivity and incentive and lower tax  and so on that are claimed for them, then, they have got to be  reviewed even if it is a politically difficult exercise. And if

it)?decided that yes that should be part of a policy platform  going into the next election then we will have to work very hard  against that objective in order to introduce that type of policy  in a pre-election context. But the nature of the circumstances  in Australia calls for a political party to be prepared to raise  those issues.

The final one that I have raised which has caused me a fair

degree of controversy is the issue of Parliamentary standards  and political performance. I have a fairly simplistic view that  I don't think that Parliament really ought to be a blood sport  for the entertainment for a few people in the media. I think it

is basically an area in which we run the country and people pay  us to do a job and they expect us to do that job. They expect

us to focus on issues and deal with issues and debate issues in  a productive way, not to run something of a circus and so we are  going to push on with that.

Â·>ÃÂÃÂ²'ÃÂ½ÃÂ² attacked the Government at every turn where we feel they  have fallen off Parliamentary standards, trying to treat question  time as a joke rather than as an avenue for answering serious  questions or making ministerial statements in question time which  ought to be made by way of formal ministerial statements,

encouraging the Treasurer to make major public statements and  policy statements to the Parliament rather than to other venues  around the country, attacking the Government for guillotining  thirty five bills in the recent Parliamentary sitting in two days  when many of those bills demanded in themselves several days

consideration. Think of the wool tax bill as one of those

examples. But thirty five bills in two days, we were happy to  stay in the Parliament an extra week or two to make sure that  that process ran its course. We attacked them for sitting for  only nine days in the first half of this calendar year and they

scheduled twenty seven days in the second half of this year which  will give us the second lowest number of sitting days in our  history since Federation. So we will sustain that attack. I put

it to you that the electorate is interested in that issue. It  puts it very high on the agenda, even if certain elements of the  Gallery don't think it is very important, and we will just

continue with it.

6

The second part of the remarks today is that I Just wanted to  comment briefly on a number of issues which have emerged in  recent days. I think it would fair to say that if you look at

the Government's performance since the March 24th election the  one overriding conclusion you would draw is that they didn't  expect to win - because they had no vision or no ideas or no

strategy beyond that date and what you have had is a range of ad  hocery which I think is setting, in many cases, the decisions  that are being taken are setting this country off on precisely

the wrong course, relative to what will be required in the course  of this decade.

This is like the debate about a recession, for example, to me are  becoming an annoying distraction. To hear the debate to whether  or not it is a technical recession you are inclined to say so  what. Our economy is very flat, it will be flat for twelve or  eighteen months from now. We are going to have at least two

years of a very flat period. Now, it may not be in statistical  terms, yet, a recession. But it is seeing hundreds of thousands  of small businesses and personal bankruptcies. They are record  levels and the amount of pain out there as a result of the

Government's policies should not be underestimated. The tragedy  of a National Accounts number, as we saw the other day, where as  many in the media said that it gives the Government breathing  space. The tragedy is it may be another quarter or two quarters

before the Government realises the magnitude of the damage that  has been done by high interest rates. It might be another couple  of quarters that that pain is going to be unnecessarily

prolonged, another couple of quarters before they actually do  shift policy as is required in the current circumstances. If the  Government waits to see the whites of the eyes of the recession  in statistical terms it may well be too late for the great bulk  pf small to medium sized business in Australia.

This is a different recessionary period or period of flat

activity. I w o n ’t use the word recession. But it is a different  period because it is driven by a collapse of asset markets.  Asset prices are falling more significantly than has been the  case in previous recessions, yet interest rates are still high

in nominal and real terms, higher than they have been in the  past. Its a quite different experience. You are not seeing the  effects on unemployment yet that you have seen on earlier

occasions because the nature of the labour market has changed so  dramatically in recent years. Redundancy deals are being done  in recent times, firms have an incentive to hang onto Labor as  long as possible to avoid those redundancy deals. They may

ultimately have the impact on unemployment that we fear, at this  stage they haven't. But so you are seeing record levels of

personal bankruptcies and small business failures rather than the  traditional increase in unemployment at this stage. Although  unemployment has gone up by 50,000 since October of last year,

.  We are also in a period where the banks are pulling back or

starting to pull back significantly on available credit and a  large part of the business community is going to be subject to

7

a double whammy.  That is, not only are interest rates high and  as the Government says likely to stay high for some time yet but  the banks are now starting to restrict credit. So you are going  to have a credit squeeze on top of high real interest rates of  the last two to three years. You think of the difficulties that  the corporate sector will run into as the banks realise that a  lot of the paper they put on their books in recent years isn't  good, the percentage of non performing loans relative to capital

is now at near record levels and you are going to go into a very  difficult period. It may not be called a technical recession.  As I say the pain for the business community is going to be quite  significant. And yet inflation is still rolling on right through  this period. Who would have thought that the economy could have  been flattened the way it has been and inflation still to be  running at eight to nine percent as it presently is at the

current time. And people have got very sad inflationary

expectations, if you think about it. You see them rushing into  fixed interest, five year mortgage money at 15.5%. They have  basically given up on the prospect of inflation being brought  under control or interest rates coming down significantly.

The second set of issues of the last few days that have been of  concern to me are those foreign ownership decisions that related  to foreign investment in the television industry and most  recently in the newsprint industry. There you have got two  industries that require significant restructuring. That  restructuring is going to involve an injection of capital and  the decision that has to be taken is where is that capital going  to come from in current very difficult equity market

circumstances. The television ownership decision didn't, to me,  have any logic to it all. There had been a well established set  of rules for nearly ten years which allowed twenty per cent  foreign ownership in the licence and 49.9% foreign ownership in

the holding company. A well established set of rules under which  everyone had operated and against which there were no proposals  to significantly change those rules. None of the proposals for  the restructuring of the networks went anywhere near breaching

those rules, yet there is a retrospective change to those rules  so it became twenty per cent across the board. And it seems now  that the Government in taking that decision readily accepted the  prospect that maybe we would only have two rather than three  commercial networks. It seems a nonsensical and unjustified  retrospective changing of the rules in an industry that

desperately needs to be restructured.

Similarly the Treasurer felt at home knocking over the proposal  that was only rumoured that Maxwell might buy into the West  Australian newspaper with an offer as high as 49% foreign capital - only rumoured to be the case, no foreign investment proposal,

no proposal gone before the Treasurer - but he rules it out of  order and plucks a number out of the air - some magic 25% number - which doesn't mean anything. And this is the Treasurer who has  run this country into the ground, who has sent it broke, who has  put it up for sale at bargain basement prices, who last year  approved 32 billion dollars worth of foreign investment

proposals, and that was at a time when our current account

8

deficit was $17.5 billion - $32 billion - $15 billion of those  being in real estate - and then he starts to get very selective  about other particular proposals in industries that really need  restructuring. There's no economic logic to it. There's no logic

in defence of our national culture or national interest, as he  puts it. The only justification that you come up with is that  he's doing it for short-term personal politically expedient  reasons - trying to buy the support, in a very jingoistic sense  of the left wing and the centre left of his party in support of

his leadership bid. Its got nothing to do with what those

industries will require down the track and there's nothing in  those proposals which to my mind would have in any way

compromised our national culture or our national identity.

Similarly, the decision on the ANZ-National Mutual merger, here  we have an inconsistency between the Treasurer's view about the  significance of the superannuation industry on the one hand and

his views on competition and industry restructuring on the other.  The Treasurer has created an environment in which savings are  being channelled into superannuation. He gives a tax break for

the money to go into superannuation and a process of occupational  superannuation is an additional impetus to the growth of that  industry. He boasts, quite openly, that the industry will grow  to $600 - $800 billion under management by the Year 2000. He's

consciously created a set of circumstances where savings move  from everywhere else in the economy into the superannuation  industry. In particular they move from banks into the

superannuation industry. So you shouldn't be too surprised if  a bank wants to get involved in the superannuation industry,  particularly if you recognise that in producing $600 - $800  billion under management by the Year 2000 the industry is going

to need something like $35 -$50 billion of capital.injection on  the existing mix of business. Now where is that money going to  .come from in our current and prospective economic circumstances?

The inconsistency in his approach is mind boggling. His

justification was I want to preserve competition and he said  insurance and banking are really two quite separate businesses  and I would like to keep those institutions separate to preserve  competition. So when he was asked, well why did you approve the  Coles/Myer merger he said well they are two quite separate  businesses, retailing and food. The same argument used to defend  two quite inconsistent positions. What concerns me is that

superannuation is going to be a big industry, it is going to  involve a large capital injection and where's the capital going  to come from? The banks are the largest potential domestic  source of capital - is he really going to let a major foreign  institution take over one of our major domestic superannuation

funds or life insurance companies? That, short of

nationalisation, is the only other place he's going to get the  capital from.

9

Fourthly, we have the issue right now of the Premiers'

Conference. And again we are starting to see the posturing that's  taking place between the Premiers and the Commonwealth about the  annual bunfight that takes place next week which we call the  premiers Conference/Loan Council meetings. Yet we have a basic

structural problem there that's not going to be addressed, that  doesn't look like it's going to be addressed by this Government.  You have the continuing problem that the States do the spending

in this country in large part and the Commonwealth does the  taxing in large part. To the extent that it doesn't do the

taxing, the States have come up with a whole host of taxes and  charges of their own to try and pick up the difference as

restraint has been put on their expenditure, or the Commonwealth  payments to the States in recent years. We now also have the  situation where a lot of the public sector debt is being

eliminated from the Commonwealth sector but it is still quite  significant and the debt service burden in particular is very  significant at the State level. In those circumstances there is  a crying need for structural change in the nature of the

financial relationships between the Commonwealth and the States.  You'll never get a better time, in my mind, to do it than at

present where the States are struggling under those debt burdens  and they have seen their revenue bases collapse, particularly  those associated with the recent property boom, stamp duty  revenues and others which have collapsed quite dramatically in  the course of the last 12 months. And in circumstances where the

States are for the first time being reviewed by somebody like  Moodys, separately, from the Commonwealth. The prospect that  Moodys could downgrade the State of Victoria, relative to the  Commonwealth, is there at the present time. So there's a very

important structural need that needs to be addressed in terms of  Commonwealth-State relations and its (to be) hoped that the  challenge is taken up.

.Ã¢ÂÂ¢There's one final dimension of that which, of course, is very  important. Most of the micro reform that needs to be done in this  country, whether it's waterfront reform, privatising port  authorities or putting an enterprise focus to their wage

negotiations, or land transport, road and rail transport for  example, and a host of others, they involve a very important  degree of co-operation between the Commonwealth and the States.  Another central element of the Premiers Conference this year

ought to be the basis for an agreed agenda between the

Commonwealth and the States on micro-reform in the course of the  next three years.

Finally, of course, the last nonsensical debate associated with  ad hocery as its taking place at the present time, is this debate  about the so-called multi-function polis. what on earth is that  debate all about. How many people in this room, going into a new  business, would contemplate a situation where they are told that  they've got to take a particular location in a particular State  before they know what the business will do and before they know  whether the business will be viable. That's the nature of the  debate at the present time. And you get canned, of course, if you

stand up and you are seen to talk against a concept like that,

10

because technology is like motherhood, you know we've just simply  got to have it, but when you think about, what sort of technology  are we after, are their better and more effective ways of getting  that technology? Is a separate city the answer to getting

technology transfer in this country? On the one study that I've  seen, which admittedly was a preliminary study, it would take 20  years before we got a favourable effect on our balance of

payments under the separate city concept that was investigated  in that study with very significant increases in foreign

ownership and foreign debt levels, very little to no benefit to  this country for 20 years. I think it's about time we had a

realistic assessment of what on earth is happening out there and  it boggles the mind that you would determine the location for  something (when) you don't know what it will be or what form it  will take or whether it will be viable well in advance of that

debate taking place.

So I just want to summarise my position by saying that since the  Election you've had a string of ad hoc decisions and statements  and performances by the Hawke/Keating Government. They clearly  have no vision, they clearly have got no direction for this  country, and, as I say, they clearly didn't expect to win the

last Election. Their thinking stopped on the 24th March, yet  we are in the most difficult set of circumstances, at least since  the post-War period in my view, with a period of very flat

activity and prospects where we will see record levels of

personal bankruptcy, record levels of small to medium size  business failures and record levels of individual financial  hardship. The magnitude of our problems is enormous and the  Government is just letting the situation drift.

By comparison; we've set our sights on winning the next Election.  In doing that, I've recognised that you don't win elections in  Ã¢ÂÂ¢the last five weeks -as has been tried in the past - you win them  over three years. It's a long hard slog, day by day, day after

day, right through that three year period. We believe the

changes we've put in place in recent days in terms of the

Parliamentary Party and the Party organisation - which are  unprecedented - will provide us with the basis on which we can  go ahead, delineate our vision, further refine our policy  position and win the next election.

Thank you.
