PRIME MINISTER

TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH BARBARA WALTERS, ABC GOOD MORNING  AMERICA, WASHINGTON DC, 27 JUNE 1989.

Walters: Prime Minister Bob Hawke of Australia is in the United  States for an official visit. Later today he meets with President  George Bush and Secretary of State James Baker. It's the first  Bush/Hawke summit since Mr Bush was elected President and it's  pretty certain that trade between the two countries will top the  discussions. Right now the Prime Minister joins us from  Washington.

Walters: Good Morning Mr Prime Minister. It's a sad fact that  most Americans probably would not know unprompted, the name of  the Prime Minister of Australia. Do most Australians know the  name of the President of the United States?

PMi They sure do.

Walters: We are remiss. Most of what we know about Australia  probably comes from Crocodile Dundee movies or commercials. Can  you tell us, what should we know most about your wonderful  country?

PM: I think you should know there's a country of 17 million down  there in the South Pacific and probably the strongest ally that  the United States has. We fought together in wars side by side  and that in peace time we've formed an alliance in defence as the  values that we share.  The previous President said that this

relationship was amongst the most important and that's a view  that this President shares. So I guess those are the important  sorts of things as well as the fact that we're able to knock you  over pretty regularly at tennis and anything else you like to  take us on at like sailing.

Walters: Oh I see well as I was not going to bring it up Mr Prime  Minister, but we saw you play golf with President Bush, you were  not great...(laughter).

PMi You didn't see me play golf. You saw a most unfair  representation. My first shot after weeks on an aeroplane and  sitting in rooms, why didn't you show the second shot?

Walters: Because you shot into the fairway but it was the wrong  one. (laughter) well maybe we'll show the second one. on your  agenda today I don't think you're going to be discussing golf Mr  President, what is it? what are the biggest trade concerns.

PM: Well, we're a bit worried that the program you have here,  your export enhancement program to protect your farmers is  knocking the bejesus out of your own people here. It's costing

(PM Cont) about $74 Billion a year, to your taxpayers and  consumers. The 90 odd per cent are being taken for a ride in  favour of a very small percentage and we're the ones that to some  extent are getting hurt. But we're not going to allow that  particular argument that we have to upset the firm understandings

and points of agreement we have on just about every other issue.  But that's a silly thing that's happening to American taxpayers  and consumers. You are paying as I say the best part of a $100  billion which increases your costs and your prices. That's

stupid. We think it's stupid. The Europeans are doing the same.  You're trying to beat them but in the process you're hurting  yourself and the rest of the world.

WaltersÂ·. Do you think you're going to get that changed?

PM: No. I have a great conviction in my own h u t  T d e a l t  ÃÂ I  I  s i  - 1  -  -------  . . . 1  vw - ,

Walters: Mr Prime Minister you know how concerned we have been  about what's been going on in China and I'm sure you have as  well. And you have trade with China. What is your attitude  towards the Chinese? How far are you going in condemnation or

restrictions?

PMÂ«  I've had the opportunity already on Sunday of having long  talks with George Bush about this. Our positions are I would say  Identical. What we are going to do Barbara is two things and it's

very difficult to walk the line between. Firstly we have to  unequivocally condemn the barbarism, brutality, the  unacceptability of what they've done in Tianaman Square on the  fourth, and persecution and execution of people since then.

There's no question about that. Secondly in the interests of the  people of China themselves as well as the region and of the  world. We mustn't close off the relationship with China and turn  them in on themselves, because that would be bad for the Chinese

people. It will stifle the moves that will inevitably go on  within that great country for further not only economic reform  but for further political reform. If we close ourselves off. If  we don't cooperate in an acceptable way then we will be going

against the interests of the very people we want to help. Now  that's a difficult line which political leaders have to walk. But  to attempt to walk it we must.

Walters: I think it is very similar to the point of view of our  President.

PM: I think we are at one.

Walters: Sir, you do have another problem, and that is that eight  years from now Hong Kong goes back to the Chinese and are you  concerned that you may have so many refugees from Hong Kong. Can  you handle them, will you take them all.

PM: I like the assumption in your question that w e ’ve got to  handle them.

Walters: Well, I ’ve heard that a greats many of them have already  buying homes in Australia and ... are thinking of going there.

PM: Well sure, under our immigration program Barbara we have a  business migration element in which we welcome people from there  and other areas. It's going to be, if you take the most  pessimistic scenario, and there isn’t a decent relationship  between China and Hong Kong and the rest of the world at that

time, then all the world and particularly Britain that has the  relationship with Hong Kong has to be prepared to do something  about accepting those people who want to leave.

Walters: We thank you for being with us. We hope that Americans  will remember the name. I ’m sure they all liked seeing you today.  Prime Minister Bob Hawke of Australia. Thank you.
