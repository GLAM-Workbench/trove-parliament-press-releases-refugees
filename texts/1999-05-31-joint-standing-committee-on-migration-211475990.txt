Committee finds refugee review fee should stay

Â

The Joint Standing Committee on Migration has recommended maintaining 
the $1,000 fee on unsuccessful applicants  to the Refugee Review 
Tribunal, the Chair of the Committee, Mrs Chris Gallus, announced today.

Â

Mrs Gallus was speaking at the conclusion of the Committee’s 
inquiry into Migration Regulation 4.31B.

Â

“The regulation forms part of a package of measures 
to deter non-genuine applicants,” said Mrs Gallus.

Â

“The Minister asked us to examine the regulation 
on 6 January 1999. This followed a commitment in 1997 that the fee would 
be reviewed within 2 years.”

Â

During the inquiry that collected 24 submissions and 
over 100 pages of transcript evidence, some groups expressed concern 
that the fee could be stopping genuine refugees from appealing.

Â

“The groups who suggested this failed to produce 
appropriate cases that would have supported their claim,” Mrs Gallus 
said.

Â

“The Department of Immigration provided evidence 
that the numbers of refugees from countries where refugees had traditionally 
come had not decreased; but the numbers from traditionally low refugee 
producing countries had gone down.”

Â

“However, we felt that 2 years had not been long 
enough to provide unequivocal evidence and for this reason we recommended 
that the regulation be looked at in another three years.
