ASHLEIGH GILLON: Stephen Smith, thank you for your time.

Is Thailand a safe place to go right now, or are you warning travellers to stay away?

STEPHEN SMITH: Our travel advice says that people need to exercise a high degree of caution.

We have a large number of Australians who go to Thailand, in particular, Bangkok and Phuket every year.

We have, in recent days, drawn attention to the need for Australians to stay away from demonstrations,

and to also be careful about their presence near government buildings.

We, of course, want the situation in Thailand to be resolved peacefully and peaceably, but we are advising

Australians to exercise a high degree of caution, and in particular to stay away from large gatherings of

people, in particular the demonstrations.

ASHLEIGH GILLON: Political unrest isn't exactly rare in Thailand. What's the best outcome from this latest

eruption?

STEPHEN SMITH: The best outcome so far as Australia is concerned is that Thailand continues to resolve

these matters peacefully.

We've had such protests before by the so-called red shirts, and also previously by the so-called yellow

shirts, the supporters of Prime Minister Abhisit. So our urgings is that these matters be resolved peacefully

in accordance with Thailand's democratic ways. We have regrettably in the past seen military intervention.

We are very pleased that that road has not been gone down for some time and we urge Thailand and its

people to resolve these matters peacefully.

ASHLEIGH GILLON: On another matter, our viewers just heard an update about the cyclone in Fiji.

What's the latest information you have on the situation and is Australia standing by to help?

STEPHEN SMITH: We're monitoring this carefully. All the advice is that the cyclone will hit in the course of

the day, so Australians in Fiji should follow the advice of the local authorities. Anyone thinking of travelling

to Fiji should obviously consult with their travel advisors and proceed with caution today.

We are, as we always are with Fiji, ready, willing and able to provide assistance if that is required as we

have in the past with floods and cyclones and the like.

ASHLEIGH GILLON: On another issue, the Daily Telegraph is reporting today that two vessels carrying

several hundred asylum seekers are on their way to Australian waters and it says that the move to process

asylum seekers in Darwin is imminent. Is that right?

STEPHEN SMITH: Firstly these are matters for my colleague, the Immigration Minister, Senator Evans. But

I never comment and the Government never comments on intelligence or speculation or rumour about boat

arrivals. We know that we have a very serious problem that we need to confront.

Senator Evans has made it clear that Christmas Island, of course, has a limited capacity, some 2,000 or so

with further improvements to be made which will see a capacity of 2,300 to 2,400 in the near future. But

he's also made it clear that if that capacity is met then the facility in Darwin will be used for processing of

offshore arrivals.

ASHLEIGH GILLON: And do you expect we'll see that in the coming weeks or months?

STEPHEN SMITH: I think we should not respond to rumour, but just take it step by step and allow Senator

Evans to make calm and careful and deliberate decisions and announcements as time arises.

ASHLEIGH GILLON: There's been a lot of confusion and speculation about President Obama's upcoming

visit to Australia.

Parliament was meant to break for seven weeks this Thursday, but the Government recalled Parliament

next Monday and Tuesday to welcome the President. When are you expecting Mr Obama here?

STEPHEN SMITH: As the White House made clear over the weekend, and as they advised us, President

Obama has had to put off his visit for a couple of days, so the Parliament won't now sit on Monday and

Tuesday to welcome him.

In accordance with the most recent advice, President Obama will be here arriving on Thursday with an

address to the Parliament on Friday. So Parliament will sit on the Friday and that's the advice that the

White House made clear overnight and we welcome very much his arrival. As the Prime Minister has said,

any time President Obama wants to visit Australia, we're very pleased to roll out the welcome mat.

ASHLEIGH GILLON: You are, this week, hosting the Deputy Chair of the African Union, I understand.

We've heard a lot about racism targeting Indian people and today there's a report accusing Victoria Police

of actually targeting African youths. Is this an issue you've had to confront with the Africans as well?

STEPHEN SMITH: I haven't seen that report. It's not something that's been drawn to attention. But the

Government's been working very hard to enhance its engagement with Africa, both the continent and the

constituent countries, over 50 countries, and also the African union. So today I'll be formally meeting with

the Deputy Chair of the African Union and also meeting with South Africa's Deputy Foreign Minister.

This continues our enhanced engagement with Africa which is economically and strategically very

important to Australia in the long-term. We know, of course, Africa also has its difficulties, so I'm also

announcing today a humanitarian assistance package of some $11 million for food and emergency

assistance for Somalia, for the Congo, and also for Kenya where we see difficulty so far as food and

displaced people are concerned.

ASHLEIGH GILLON: Foreign Minister, Stephen Smith, thanks for your time.

STEPHEN SMITH: Thanks very much.
