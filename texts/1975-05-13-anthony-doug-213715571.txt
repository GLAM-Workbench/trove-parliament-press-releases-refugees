CENSURE MOTION

Speech by the Leader of the National Country Party of Australia

Rt. Hon. J.D. Anthony

The Prime Minister, as usual on these occasions, has talked  about everything but the real subject of the debate - that is his  deception of the Parliament.  I say ’these occasions' because we  have a lot of them. When you have a Prime Minister whose  principles are of the kind which this Prime Minister and his

Government espouse, then you have to expect this kind of debate  quite often. That in itself is a pity, because there are many  urgent and deep national problems demanding our attention. We have  had inflation, and bad unemployment - with both getting worse. But  when there is such a clear deception of the Parliament by the Prime  Minister, it cannot be ignored.

And that is what this debate is all about - the Prime Minister's  deception of the Parliament. He has done all he can to avoid talking  about that deception. He will be shielded from the censure of the  Parliament by the people who sit behind him, even though they know  that he does not deserve their protection.

This afternoon the Leader of the Opposition has spelt out  indisputably the difference between the cables sent by the Prime  Minister to Hanoi and Saigon. In view of the firm and categorical  denial of any difference by the Prime Minister and supported by  the Minister for Foreign Affairs in another place, there is clear

evidence for everybody to see that the Prime Minister has deceived  the Parliament and has tried to suppress and keep secret the  Government's real feeling and attitudes. This is therefore a  matter of utmost concern for the Australian people. All the counter

charges, all the accusations and allegations, the red herrings  thrown about, do not alter the inescapable fact -- the Prime  Minister has deceived the Parliament and the nation. The Prime  Minister has been exposed for duplicity in foreign affairs. The  Prime Minister’s integrity and trust must now be challenged.

Under the Westminster Parliamentary system there is nothing  more serious, no greater felony, than for a Prime Minister to  mislead the Parliament. And when the deception is in the most  important area of foreign affairs it makes the felony doubly

serious. The Prime Minister’s departure from the truth must place  in question Australia's position of trust with other countries,  particularly those we look upon as friends and allies.

This whole issue exposes : .the devious attitude of the  Govermment to the cause of Communism. If the cables had not  become public (and goodness knows what other messages have been  conveyed) the Australian people would never have known that  their Government had in the most secretive way been doubleÂ­ dealing to assist and encourage '.the Communist cause in South  Vietnam. In '-other words, the actions of this Government have been  tantamount to conspiring to help Communist expansion in IndoÂ­ china.

This could have lasting and serious consequences for other

V

countries in South-East Asia, and ultimately for ourselves. The whole balance of political power has now been altered in  favour of the Communists in one of the potentially most unstable  regions of the world. Vietnam now has one of the best-equipped

and largest military forces in the world. It seems as a result  of the Communist victory, the Soviet Union will possibly establish  a naval base in South Vietnam. All of these things can" hardly  be claimed to be in the long-term interests of Australia or her  friends in this part of the world.

The letters and cables, as demonstrated by the Leader of the  Opposition, verify that the Government has been more than  sympathetic to Communist aggression and Communist victory in  Vietnam - a victory which will mean that, systematically and  ruthlessly, any western influence or political opposition will  be removed. Obviously the Prime Minister is conscious of the  general feeling of Australians. What other reason can be given  for the underhand way in which he has handled this matter ? Why  did he mislead the Parliament ? Why did he try to hide and cover  up ?

There are many issues that cluster around this central matter  of deception. There is the issue of the Prime Minister's support  for the Communist side in Vietnam. There is the issue of the Prime  Minister's efforts to hide that support from this Parliament and  from the Australian people. There is the issue of the Prime  Minister's continuing efforts to place all the blame in Vietnam  on the side that was under attack - the South.

It has been the South - those who have been suffering the  aggression of the Communists - who have been blamed by the Prime  Minister for the continuation of the war. Not a word of blame, not  a word of condemnation or rebuke, has passed the Prime Minister's

lips about the Communist side. The only words he has uttered  about the Communists have been words of understanding, words of  advice. And the words that have passed the lips of the Deputy  Prime Minister have been words of encouragement to the Communists,  but that's par for the course as far as he's concerned.

And there is the issue of the Prime Mnnister's attitude to the  Vietnamese refugees, and the sense of shame this has given so many  Australians. These are very important matters, and they reveal a  great deal about the attitude of this Government.

But I repeat that the heart of this debate is the deception  practised by the Prime Minister. Deception is a fairly kind word  for what the Prime Minister did on 9th April. The Sydney Morning  Herald used a more appropriate word in its editorial of 30th April,  when it said: "The Prime Minister has lied to Parliament".  It

is this deception, this act which the Herald called lying, which  has moved the Opposition today to censure the Prime Mnister on  behalf of the Australian people whom he deceived. By trying to  divert attention away from his deception, the Prime Minister

today did not remove the distrust he has drawn to himself - he  compounded it. By talking about matters which have nothing to do  with his deception of the Parliament, he has not allayed the  fears and suspicions which his deception created, but deepened

them.

All the Prime Minister had to do today was admit to the House  that he was wrong when he said* on 9th April, that the two cables  he sent - one to Hanoi and one to Saigon - were not the same, as

he then claimed they were- He could have admitted what everyone  who has now read the cables knows. He could have frankly told the  House that he was in error; that on looking at the cables he now  agrees that they are in fact substantially different. But of

course the Prime Minister wouldn't do that. He has tried instead  to show that the cables were in fact substantially the same. He  has brought forward all sorts of other communications to support  his position. He has delved into history to try to find records

that might in some way reflect on people who made decisions years  ago. How can any of these things justify or excuse the Prime  Minister's own actions ?

The simple fact is, as the Prime Minister knows and everyone  else knows, he did not tell the truth when he said in this House  on 9th April that his cables to Hanoi and Saigon were substantially  the same. The simple fact is, as the Prime Minister and everyone

else knows, that the Prime Minister has given support to the  Communist cause in Vietnam. No amount of waffle by the Prime  Minister or anyone else can change these facts.

Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister has developed his own  technique for dealing with these frequent attacks on his integrity.  He has had to do that, of course, because his actions spark off  these attacks so often. We've seen him use this technique on  many occasions of this kind. The technique involves ignoring the

substance of the matter and retreating under a smokescreen of  things that have nothing to do with the subject. To me, and  I'm sure to most people, this technique does nothing to help the  Prime Minister - it merely gives greater substance to his guilt.

We can recall a number of occasions when the Prime Minister  has used this technique. We can recall the shabby way in which  he got rid of the former Treasurer and put the present one in his  place. What a ghastly error of judgement that was !  But the  technique was used then. We can recall the destruction of the

former Speaker, and the fundamental breaches of principle and  privilege which were involved in that episode. The technique was  used then. We can recall the Gair affair, the ASIO affair, when the  Prime Minister mislead Parliament and the Senate acted to impeach  him. We can recall the many occasions on which the Prime Minister  has breached tradition and convention. The same technique was used

every time.

Why does the Prime Minister do it? Why does he go to so much

trouble to avoid the issue, to cover-up, to hjde? The most  apparent reason is that he simply does not want to acknowledge his  errors. But I think there is a deeper reason - a reason which is  becoming clear to more and more people. And that reason lies in

expediency.

It is becoming more and more clear that when the Prime  Minister sets himself on a course, then nothing stands in the  way of it. Principle is cast aside. Integrity is forgotten. The  truth becomes a casualty. Deception becomes commonplace. If the

Prime Minister decides to get rid of a minister, then he  relentlessly pursues that objective until he achieves it. If the  Prime Minister decides to get rid of the Speaker and" assert his  own domination oVer the House, then nothing is too shameful to

stand in his way. If the Prime Minister decides to try to rig the  numbers in the Senate, or to try to rig a court, then he sets out  to do it with an admirable yet reprehensible single-mindedness. If  the Prime Minister decides that he wants to side with the

Communists, then he does it. When this bias is exposed, he denies  it and tries to hide it.

I suppose many of the other things in which this Prime Minister z  has been involved will not leave irreparable damage behind them. Of course there will be some continuing damage as a result of the  Gair affair, the ASIO affair, the Cope affair, the Crean affair,  and all the others. But the damage that will flow from the Prime  Minister’s bias to the Communist cause, and the deception that

bias had led him to engage in, will not be easily rectified. Certainly his own standing in the eyes of the Parliament and in the  eyes of the Australian people has been badly damaged, if not  destroyed.

But what is much more important is the damage that has been  done to Australia. The Prime Minister is here today and gone  tomorrow. I'm not talking merely about his overseas travel, but  about his appearance on the Australian political scene. But  Australia will be here for a long time, and we will have to live  with many other nations, and work with them, and have their trust, ,

for a long time.

The great tragedy of this Prime Minister is the damage he  has done, not only to himself, but to this country. We cannot earn  the trust of other nations if we have a Prime Minister whose  attitudes and actions are based on expediency. We cannot expect  others to take us at our word if the word of our Prime Minister  cannot be taken with confidence. We cannot be seen as a nation  of integrity if our Prime Minister, under the cloak of so-called

even-handedness in foreign affairs, takes sides, and takes sides  secretly. We cannot, as a nation, have trust in our Government  when the Pimme Minister cannot be relied upon to speak the truth  in this Parliament.

This is the simple charge which has been made against the Prime  Minister - that he misled and deceived this Parliament. The fact  that he did deceive and mislead the House is plain for all to see,  and cannot be denied or explained away by all the Prime Ministerial  rhetoric or departmental leaking and explaining to the world.

The Prime Minister will be saved from the censure he should  receive no doubt because the people who sit behind him lack the  courage and the integrity to do what is right. But I want them to  remember that in saving the Prime Minister, they will be doing  nothing to restore in the eyes of the world the reputation of

integrity and trust which this nation should enjoy, but which the  Prime Minister has so seriously sullied.

13th May 1975.
