Subjects: Foreign politics in 2013 around the world.

RICHARD GLOVER: Before we hear the song, though, let's just talk  about the world, and what's going to happen in the world of 2013.  2012, of course, was a pretty dramatic year in world politics. Egypt  got its first democratic president, there was a dramatic escalation of  violence in the Middle East between Israel and Gaza. Succession  occurred in North Korea, but continuing misery for its people if there  were expectations that things might change, that didn't seem to  happen. Big change of leadership in China, only happens once a  decade. Affects, well, a quarter of the world's population, and, of  course, continuing horrible violence in Syria.

What challenges will this year bring, and what pressure will Australia  be able to bring to bear from its new seat on the UN Security Council,  Bob Carr is Australia's Foreign Minister and he joins us in the studio.

Senator, good afternoon.

BOB CARR: Good afternoon Richard.

RICHARD GLOVER: If you had to guess, 2013, what are going to be  the powder kegs, I suppose, of this year?

BOB CARR: You can never guess. I remember a few months ago  talking to someone from the American foreign policy establishment,  and she said just before the Arab Spring erupted in Cairo, she was  there with the Council of Foreign Relations, and she had well  informed people, experts in Egyptian intelligence predicting that the  demonstration in Tahrir Square the next day would probably  represent only a few thousand people.

So, it's very hard to predict. I'm interested in a range of things, but  whether the rest of the world wants to respond, I'm interested in  getting on to the world agenda a focus on the catastrophic condition  of human rights in North Korea, the existence of a North Korean  gulag that has an estimated 200,000 or more prisoners, and seeing if  the world, at a time of some change in North Korea, could exert  pressure to have a humanisation of those sorts of [indistinct]…

RICHARD GLOVER: Okay it really depends on China doesn't it? More  than anything else.

BOB CARR: Yeah, China's the one power that could move effectively  in a way that influences North Korea and there are the first hints that  the new leadership in China, yet to be properly installed, is focused  on some measure of political reform.

There's been the report, apparently well sourced, about China paying  attention to its own detention camps, reeducation camps, in which  people can be confined without a decision of the courts, and without  any review of the courts. When Xi Jinping spoke about the rule of law  in China, he was obviously pointing at this, because it is the most

obvious breach of the rule of law. A system of detention  independent of any judicial review.

RICHARD GLOVER: So he talked about the rule of law in North Korea  did he?

BOB CARR: No, no, in China, and I'm saying that creates a context in  which some engagements with…

RICHARD GLOVER: He can then ping the other side.

BOB CARR: …some engagement with China about catastrophically  alarming level of abuse in North Korea might be feasible.

RICHARD GLOVER: Mmm. Let me talk to you about Syria.

Your predecessor, Kevin Rudd, as Foreign Minister, he's come out  now and said that we should be considering arming the rebels. At  least give them a fighting chance. 60,000 people have died according  to the UN in Syria, when 2000 had died in Libya, already the west  were doing something about it. We don't seem to be doing that in  Syria.

BOB CARR: Indeed. The cost of intervention is enormously greater in  Syria than it was ever going to be in Libya. The far more formidable  defence forces arrayed in support of the Syrian Government. There is  no comparison with the pretty flimsy defence that Gaddafi was able  to call on.

RICHARD GLOVER: But you can't make a human rights policy, oh we  do it when it's easy.

BOB CARR: Well, let's just tease this argument out a bit more. You do  what you can do, but we've had enough lessons in the unintended  consequences of intervention in the Arab world to give us pause.

I spoke to one Arab foreign minister who said, specifically addressing  this problem, that he would support weapons being supplied to  rebels in Syria if he could be given the CV, the name and address, of  the people who would end up with those weapons. It's a lesson of  Afghanistan, the American army of the Mujahideen, the irony that  after the Russians withdrew from Afghanistan in 1989 those  weapons, given to the Mujahideen by the Reagan Administration,  were there to be used against the west.

So we've got to think very carefully about…

RICHARD GLOVER: I understand that argument, but there is  something awful about the idea that the regime is being supplied by  - with weapons and the rebels are not.

BOB CARR: It is a big step, a big step for the west to decide to  provide weaponry for one part of this civil war. It's a step that might  be taken, but there are big consequences. In the meantime we've got  two priorities. One, providing humanitarian assistance to look after  the refugees - we are the sixth biggest humanitarian contributor to  this crisis. We pay more attention to the condition in the refugee  camps that are in Lebanon and in Jordan. Indeed, I visited two of  them in Jordan, and in Turkey. We've contributed $30million to  setting them up with tents and food - woefully inadequate given the  condition of people who've been driven out of their homes.

RICHARD GLOVER: Okay, then Kevin Rudd is wrong about going that  extra step?

BOB CARR: Well, let me just say what else we're doing, then I'll come  back to that. That's the first thing, the humanitarian assistance.

And the second one is redoubling our efforts to get all the parties in  this conflict to agree on a medical pact. A medical pact to see that

the hospitals are not bombed or used as bases, to see that we can  get medicines into Syria to see that medical personnel will not be  fired on. At the present time you've got doctors and nurses fleeing  from the country. And I've asked our UN mission to pursue, again, an  idea I broached three or four months ago in New York. And that is to  say if the parties can agree on an exchange of prisoners, as they did  last week, they can agree on enforcing international law. This is  existing international law, to protect medical supplies and medical  personnel and medical equipment.

RICHARD GLOVER: These are fantasy ideas though when you  consider the murderous nature of the regime.

BOB CARR: Well, the murderous regime - I accept that description of  the Assad regime - has agreed to a pact with the opposition to  exchange prisoners. I'm asking our mission to see whether we can  get agreement of the - especially among the five permanent  members of the Security Council, on the notion of a pact that will see  medical supplies, which these people.

Richard, there's been a lot of consideration of non-lethal assistance  to the Syrian opposition and some is flowing. That would be a step  that Australia could contemplate taking down the track, but we  would draw the line at us being involved militarily, just as we did  over Libya. We supply humanitarian and disaster relief assistance.

RICHARD GLOVER: You've been having meetings with the British,  haven't you. Are they on the same page as you?

BOB CARR: We've had preliminary meetings. We're spending a day  meeting with our British counterparts, Stephen Smith and I, in Perth  on Friday. It'll be interesting to explore the extent to which they've  moved down the checklist. Non-lethal assistance, different

categories of non-lethal assistance. There's a difference between a  paper clip and a mine detector, for example.

And to get their views on at what stage in this ruinous disastrous  calamitous civil war, the west would look at supplying arms. And  would do so in the absence of agreement on the Security Council  which I'm assuming would not be achieved.

RICHARD GLOVER: You're listening to the Foreign Minister Bob Carr,  I want to get onto Iran and Mali and lots of other topics. Before we  leave this, I'll ask you again about Kevin Rudd. He's made quite  explicit comments about considering arming the rebels. You think  he's wrong?

BOB CARR: I think his analysis of the calamitous nature of this  humanitarian crisis is absolutely correct. In capturing the despair and  the frustration we all feel, again he's right. But it is not the space we  are in at the moment, supplying military equipment, and I detect  that the United States and the Europeans are not at that point  either.

RICHARD GLOVER: In terms of our new seat on the UN Security  Council, we've been given the job of running the sanctions regime  against Iran, Al Qaeda and the Taliban, we're going to be chairman of  that committee. Bruce Haig says look, this is a toothless tiger this  particular committee, no other country wanted the job and we don't  even have enough personnel to do it properly.

BOB CARR: Well, Germany had the job before we got it, so is Bruce  Haig suggesting the Federal Republic of Germany was wrong to take  on this work? If you're on the Security Council, you do the work that  goes with it. And some of it is hard and unglamourous, and this is in  that case. What is Bruce Haig suggesting we do?

RICHARD GLOVER: Have you got enough officials to do it?

BOB CARR: Yes, we've increased the - we've significantly enhanced  the budget of our UN mission over the next two years, to see that  they can follow through on this.

RICHARD GLOVER: And this is an example, isn't it, where our position  does seem to influence our policy. Because we're on the Security  Council, we then, ourselves as a country, seem to have beefed up our  sanctions against Iran.

BOB CARR: No, this is the, I think, the fifth announcement I've made  of a steady ratcheting up of our sanctions, our, so-called autonomous  sanctions against Iran, it's in line with what our international  partners are doing, more or less.

RICHARD GLOVER: It's not just because we're on the committee, we  want to…?

BOB CARR: No, no it's not.

Australia was elected to the Security Council very largely because we  were seen as a good international citizen, a good interlocutor or  partner for so many countries. You've got a crisis in Mali at the  present time. We, out of our foreign aid budget, saw that $44 million  in 2012 was given to the Sahel, that is that band of Africa below the  Sahara, that semi-arid zone, in which there is such extensive  humanitarian disaster on display. And that was us foreseeing that we  needed to increase funding, to be delivered by international  organisations, UN and NGO organisations, in an area where there  were, I think in Mali alone, 400,000 refugees.

Not for nothing did Mali and other African countries vote for us in  that Security Council ballot. Because they saw us not as part of the  Anglo-sphere where Tony Abbott wants to contain us, but as a

country that is motivated by large humanitarian concerns. A  generous country and one that has got no racial or regional blinkers.

RICHARD GLOVER: Now just explain to people what's going on in  Mali. The French are bombing cities. An African army is being pulled  in to try to help the government. The northern parts of Mali have  been taken over by the Islamic insurgents who are adopting pretty  strict versions of Islamic law.

BOB CARR: It's a rough and ready comparison, but one with  Afghanistan would not be overblown. Even down to the drug dealing,  the criminality, the criminal cartels that are a further complication  here, and a reason why the French, after months of consideration,  decided to give their support to the government in Mali.

RICHARD GLOVER: You think that's appropriate what the French  have done?

BOB CARR: Oh absolutely appropriate, and we supported it when it's  been discussed at the Security Council. In December, there was a  resolution adopted that mandated the establishment of an African  led stabilisation force in Mali. But before that can get set up in the  country, a French presence is required, and in the mean time, we'll  be arguing the date of the African led intervention ought to be  brought forward from the middle of 2013 to really, as soon as  possible.

RICHARD GLOVER: I know we're bouncing around the world, but Fiji,  they've spent a lot of money and a lot of time on this big review of  their constitution. Great experts brought in to help them. It's finally  been released and the military government have said no, rip it up,  let's do something else.

BOB CARR: Yeah a bit more nuanced than that, but only a bit. I'm  disappointed. I would have been very disappointed if they jumped  the timetable for the election. I was relieved that that did not take  place. There's going to be an election that will have Fiji returning to  the community of democracies, that is the civic community, the  Commonwealth community…

RICHARD GLOVER: Maybe under a constitution which gives  enormous power to the army.

BOB CARR: Okay, let's just deal with that. I looked at the constitution  that had been recommended by the constitutional commission.  There were a couple of things in it that I thought the interim  government of Fiji, for all its faults, was probably reasonable to  question. For example, the idea that there should be a large  consultative body, not elected, sitting next to the parliament. I can't  think of any other constitution where you have such a citizens forum  comprised of NGOs, sitting next to an elected parliament.

To make it a little more troubling, it was proposed that that body  have the right to elect the President. If I'd been the interim Prime  Minister of Fiji, I think I would have seriously objected to that. Why  shouldn't the parliament elect the president?

Now if they're the grounds for the interim government's concerns, I  think they're readily understood. But if it goes beyond that, and they  don't like the notion of a constitution which entrenches freedom of  the media, freedom of assembly and other guarrantees…

RICHARD GLOVER: Well the constitution they're talking about limits  the role of the military in a very prescribed way, and that seems to  be one of the things that they don't like.

BOB CARR: Yeah, I don't think it was spelled out in those terms by  the interim Prime Minister, in his televised address, nor by that of  the President. But were that to be the case, that would be troubling.  In the mean time I take comfort from the fact they remain  committed to the time table for an election in Fiji by 2014, which  would enable us to lift the sanctions. And I take your qualification  that it be under a constitution that meets our requirements, and the  requirements of the community of the Pacific which is taking a keen  interest in this - all those other countries of the Pacific, Richard,  being committed to democratic governance. And Papua New Guinea  to its enormous credit, having demonstrated it can hold a rough and  ready but free and fair election across an intimidating landscape with  the most ethnically diverse population in the world, Fiji can do the  same.

RICHARD GLOVER: You're being a lot more sanguine than the New  Zealand Foreign Minister about this.

BOB CARR: No, I'm not being sanguine. Because even in my short  time in the job I've been disappointed by things that have come out  of Fiji, like the expulsion of the ILO delegation a few months ago.  Disappointed by…

RICHARD GLOVER: That's the International Labour Organisation?

BOB CARR: Yeah. And we're all - the other members of the Pacific  island forum were disappointed by that, and by various decrees and  other behaviour of the Government. But looking at the  recommendation of the constitution, I can see legitimate grounds for  argument. I hope the objections of the interim government are  based on those and not on other propositions.

RICHARD GLOVER: Foreign Minister, thank you very much for your  time this afternoon.

BOB CARR: Thank you Richard.

RICHARD GLOVER: That's Bob Carr, Senator Bob Carr, Australia's  Foreign Minister in this year that sees us on the UN Security Council  and, as he mentioned, chairing this sanctions committee which deals  with the difficult task of sanctions against Iran, Al Qaeda and the  Taliban.
