TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW - AM AGENDA WITH KIERAN GILBERT

SUBJECT: SUPERANNUATION; BUDGET; ROYALTIES; SKILLED MIGRATION;  ASYLUM SEEKERS.

E  & O E - PROOF ONLY

GILBERT: We’re joined by Finance Minister, Senator Penny Wong. Minister, thanks for  your time.

WONG: Good to be with you.

GILBERT: The outgoing minister, Simon Crean, has urged the Government to drop the  plan to raid super concessions for the wealthy. He says it would be trashing the legacy of  Hawke and Keating. What do you say to that?

WONG: What I’d say is this Government is firmly in the tradition of Hawke and Keating and  past Labor Governments. We’re about creating wealth and ensuring there is opportunity  and fairness. That is the Labor tradition.

And when it comes to superannuation, we are building on the Labor tradition. Two key  policies: increasing the superannuation guarantee from 9 to 12 per cent, a critical aspect of  work unfinished from the Keating era. And the other thing we’re doing is making sure low  income workers, millions of Australians who are on lower incomes, get a fair tax break on  their super. Something that they don’t currently get and, were Tony Abbott to be elected, he  wants to rip away.

GILBERT: But Simon Crean, first and foremost, was a member of the expenditure review  committee, until last week when he was sacked from the Cabinet. So if we wanted an  indication of where the Government was going, this is a pretty clear indication, isn’t it? He  was sacked from the ERC last week, so he knows exactly where you’re planning to make  savings, ie, on super.

WONG: I don’t get into hypotheticals, and I certainly don’t get into any gossip about what  might or might not have been discussed in a Cabinet committee. I take my responsibilities  as a Labor minister more seriously than that.

GILBERT: But he’s disclosed it, hasn’t he?

WONG: No, I don’t agree. What I would say about superannuation is this is the Party, the  Labor Party, that built superannuation over the opposition of John Howard and the Liberal  Party. And we are the Party that is strengthening superannuation through the increase in  the superannuation guarantee and the tax break for millions of low income workers. Now I  think that is a very proud record and a very proud policy platform.

GILBERT: Martin Parkinson has recently said that to be sustainable or to have these  concessions on a sustainable footing in an ageing population, that there will need to be  changes. That’s a view supported by the head of AustralianSuper - that’s a $60 billion fund.  Is that your view?

WONG: I have a very strong view about the importance of sustainability into the future.  Whether it’s super or other parts of the Budget, you always have to look at what your  decisions will mean looking out ahead. And that’s why, if you look at our past budgets and  the number of saving decisions we’ve taken over the opposition of Tony Abbott and Joe  Hockey - if those had not been taken, things like the Private Health Insurance rebate  changes, our net debt position in 2020 would be $250 billion worse. We are -

GILBERT: Is that why you’re looking then at reining in the concessions?

WONG: This is why we will always look at how you ensure strong, sustainable  superannuation, and a strong sustainable budget position - not withstanding all the  challenges that the budget and the Government and the economy face given what’s  happening to nominal GDP.

GILBERT: But how do you think that that’s going to be received in the electorate? People  who have put away their nest egg and feel that the Government is again changing the  rules?

WONG: Well, what I’d say to people first is don’t believe everything you read. And I know  that budget speculation always abounds at this time. But I think on Budget night, a lot of the  stories that are written prior to the Budget are demonstrably inaccurate. And so I‘d say to  people: look at our record and look at our support for superannuation.

GILBERT: Gary Gray’s the new Minister for Resources. He was elevated to Cabinet. He  seems to have defended, yesterday, the States’ rights to increase resources royalties. He  says it’s... he seems to be suggesting it’s a good combination and that the resources  industry are contributing more to state coffers than they ever have before, and that’s a good  thing.

WONG: Well -

GILBERT: ...The Treasurer has a very different message though, to the States. He doesn’t  think royalties should be increased.

WONG: I don’t know how you quite get that from Gary’s comments. I read Gary’s  comments as making the very obvious point that the resources sector is contributing a  significant amount of revenue to State and Federal governments. I always think it’s

interesting in this debate that the Liberal Party would die in a ditch to defend against a  mining tax but would also die in a ditch to defend the rights of Liberal states to impose  mining taxes in the form of royalties, which is more inefficient.

GILBERT: He seems to be sympathetic, do you deny that? To the States raising royalties?

WONG: I think Gary is a strong supporter of the resources sector. So if you ask me, what is  he sympathetic to, he’s sympathetic to the views of mining companies, as he should be as  the Resources Minister. He will always listen to their views and he has a very strong record  of not only working in that sector but understanding its importance to his state.

GILBERT: And on that front as well - on 457 visas, he’s argued at just how important they  are to that economy that needs labour when there are critical skill shortages. This, again,  he seems to be distancing himself from the Prime Minister’s rhetoric on 457 visas.

WONG: I think it’s very important in this debate to remember what the policy position is,  rather than people getting carried away about what they think someone said or what they  think someone said means. The policy proposition of the Government, supported by all  members of the Government, is that 457s, that is short term migrant labour, should be used  to fill skill shortages that are genuine, and not to ensure that Australians are not able to take  jobs for which they’re entitled.

GILBERT:  So the Prime Minister’s been guilty of some colourful rhetoric when the policy’s  different.

WONG: No, look, I just think it’s very important in this debate to be really clear about what  the policy is, and the policy is clear.

GILBERT: The promise to lift wages in the child care and aged care sectors apparently has  led to the unions to try and renew their push for membership targeting in the workforce.,  some 300,000. Do you concede that that injection of funds to the aged care and child care  sectors is going to have that effect of boosting union membership as well?

WONG: What I’d say is an injection of fund is important for those sectors. It’s important for  the principle of opportunity, because we want our children to have the best possible start in  life. That’s why we have our Gonski platform, and that’s why we want to improve school  funding. And it’s also why we want to ensure we continue the improvement of quality in  child care centres and similarly in aged care. We need to make sure that people in those  occupations are paid appropriately.

GILBERT: But the unions will also get a benefit of this, won’t they, with their numbers going  up?

WONG: Unions are entitled to advocate for improved wages and conditions for their  members, that’s their job.

GILBERT: But you’ve put a condition on this funding to be only given to centres that have  signed up enterprise bargaining agreements. That gives a competitive advantage to the  unions.

WONG: Hang on, you can be part of an enterprise bargaining agreement and not be a  member of a union.

GILBERT: It doesn’t happen as often, certainly not with low paid workers.

WONG: Hang on, let’s get this... we’re not saying we’re only going to pay a person ‘X’  who’s a union member and not person ‘Y’. What we’re saying is we want to use the  enterprise bargaining framework. And you know why? Because what we want is this  injection of money to go to wages, to improve the labour supply into those industries, which  is important, and not simply to be taken as profit by centres and increasing charges to  parents. It’s a very sensible policy position.

GILBERT: One final issue I want to ask you about, the boat arrivals we’ve seen in the last  few days. Obviously another tragedy at sea and there’s no sign that the boats are going to  stop at this point. What I want to ask you, though, as Finance Minister, is the financial  impact on the bottom line. According to the figures around today, the Government had  budgeted for 12,000 arrivals. We’ve already seen more than 15,000 arrivals in 2012-13.  How significant is that impact to the Government’s costing?

WONG: Well, we have to update all our estimates in every budget update. We have to  review them and update where appropriate, and that’s what we’ll do with this as with other  budget parameters. And what we will do, unlike Joe Hockey, is we will be transparent to the  Australian people about what we are spending on and the decisions, the choices, we are  making to fund important reforms like DisabilityCare and our plan for school improvement.  My challenge to Joe Hockey is: instead of the rhetoric, why don’t you come up with some  costings?

GILBERT: But your funding for the boats and the asylum seekers has been costed at  around $2.5 billion for this year, down to $1.3 billion for next year. How is there going to be  a decline given the trajectory of the number of arrivals that we’re seeing?

WONG: This is a budget question, this is a question about reviewing those forecasts and  considering whether or not they need to be updated, as with any other forecast, and we’ll  be doing that.

GILBERT: You’ve been critical of Joe Hockey but he has said that once the Pre-Election  Fiscal Outlook is out, he will release the details. That’s fair enough, it’s what Opposition’s  do.

WONG: Look, you know, it’s really interesting that Joe beats his chest regularly about  ending the ‘age of entitlement’, and then comes into the Parliament and votes against the  Government’s plans to ensure the Baby Bonus is more sustainable. He has no credibility.  It’s entirely hypocritical.

GILBERT: Finance Minister, Penny Wong, thanks for your time.
