MINISTER ANNOUNCES CLOSURE OF BRIGHTON AND 
PORTSEA SAFE HAVENS

Â

The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ru ddock, 
today announced the closure of Brighton and Portsea Safe Havens.

Â

The Minister explained that as part of the ongoing 
consolidation process, Brighton (Tas), and Portsea (Vic), would close 
early next week.

Â

“Most of the Kosovars from these havens have now 
returned to Kosovo, taking the total number of returns to nearly 3,500, 
or close to ninety per cent of those who came here under Operation Safe 
Haven,” said the Minister.

Â

“The remaining 126 Kosovars at Brighton and 55 at 
Portsea will move to Bandiana Safe Haven in northern Victoria. The total 
at Bandiana will then be 388.

Â

“Bandiana was a logical choice as the final haven 
site because it currently has the largest number of Kosovars, and with 
the arrival of the Brighton and Portsea Kosovars will be again running 
at a more cost-effective level. It will also involve fewer moves to 
consolidate the Kosovars in Bandiana.

Â

“Nearly 70 Kosovars still remain at East Hills in 
Sydney where some family members are completing medical treatment. Another 
45 Kosovars are living outside of safe havens.”

Â

Mr Ruddock expressed disappointment that the remaining 
Kosovars did not take up the offer of the Winter Reconstruction Allowance 
and return to Kosovo.

Â

“I understand that some Kosovars have needed to 
complete medical treatment before they can return, and I have extended 
the Winter Reconstruction Allowance for these families. However, I am 
concerned that other Kosovars in a position to return home may be receiving 
bad advice from certain areas - falsely raising expectations - and therefore 
choosing to remain beyond the 30 October deadline.

Â

“Accordingly, I have written to each of these Kosovar 
families, indicating that I have extended their visas for one month 
until the end of November to enable them to set out in writing why they 
believe they should be allowed to stay longer in Australia. I will consider 
further month-by-month extensions in consultation with the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Refugees.

Â

“I would like to thank the people who supported 
the Brighton and Portsea safe havens. Their efforts have ensured that 
the time the Kosovars spent in these areas was as comfortable as possible,” 
the Minister concluded.
