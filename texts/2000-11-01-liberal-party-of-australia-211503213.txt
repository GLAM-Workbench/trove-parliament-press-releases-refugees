New vessel in Customs fleet

Customs has added a new vessel to its fleet with the lease of a ferry dedicated to transporting illegal arrivals, Minister for Justice and Customs, Senator Amanda Vanstone said today.

"The lease will allow Australian Customs Service and Australian Defence Force vessels to focus existing assets on the initial interception of suspect illegal entrant vessels," Senator Vanstone said.

"This arrangement shows the Government’s commitment to Australia’s border protection. The dedicated transport vessel will reduce the need to use Customs and Navy vessels as transporters."

Managed by Customs, the vessel, Samson Explorer, a 35-metre, twin-hulled ferry, is likely to operate mainly in north-west Australia and is capable of carrying up to 150 people, far in excess of the capabilities of individual Customs and Navy vessels.

Samson Explorer will have a crew of five, with additional Customs and other Commonwealth officials on each voyage to ensure onboard security and safety of passengers and crew.

"Leasing of the vessel is part of a package announced in the Budget. The funding and effectiveness of the transport arrangement will be reviewed after two years," Senator Vanstone said.

Senator Vanstone said the Samson Explorer had already proved its worth and was involved in the transport of the 116 suspected illegal

entrants who were intercepted by Customs near Ashmore Islands earlier this week.
