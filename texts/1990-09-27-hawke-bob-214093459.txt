PRIME MINISTER

TRANSCRIPT OF NEWS CONFERENCE, ILLAWARRA STEELERS CLUB,  WOLLONGONG, 27 SEPTEMBER 1990

E & OE PROOF ONLY

JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke can we get the Balance of Payments  figures out of the way first? They've been described  generally as being within market expectations.  What do you  have to say about it?

PM: Well they seem to be in about the middle of the market  expectations,  1.8 billion. There was over $300 million of  Qantas imports in that and importantly the downward trend in  imports which has been apparent for many months has  continued. So we are on line with the Budget expectations

and importantly the Government policies which have been  aimed at two things.  That's firstly dealing with the  current account deficit and secondly with inflation. They  are on target. Of course when I say that about inflation  you have to have one question mark there which has been

acknowledged as to what the impact of oil prices will be but  as far as these figures are concerned on the important  question of the current account deficit the Budget forecasts  seem to be on track.

JOURNALIST: Still, Prime Minister, a look at the breakdown in exports.  The rural sector is still performing very  badly.

PM: Well wool of course is very bad. Now we see in this  morning's paper an indication that perhaps the Soviet Union  is going to come back into the market and of course if they  do that that will be a good thing. But wool there 's  nothing Government can do about that other than exhortation.   We're sending Minister Kerin overseas with a mission to the

Soviet Union and other countries to try and revive the  overseas interest in the wool market.  I think that will  come.

JOURNALIST: --Prime Minister-, any chance of tax relief as a  result of the -  windfall from the oil price rise? '  -PM: No. The question of tax relief is not on the agenda.  You'll appreciate that in January there will be significant  tax cuts coming up which have already been legislated for.

JOURNALIST: ... rural lobby groups ... today called for  some sort of crisis meeting with the Government about the

situation facing the rural sector.  Is that something that's  on the cards?

PM: I'm always prepared to meet representatives of the  rural industry in the 7h years we've been in Government I've  frequently met with them. Of course the basic problem of  the rural industry is, as it's been in the past in times of  crisis, is the fall in their commodity prices. The only  thing basically that Government can do on the prices receive  side is what I have been, myself and had my Ministers  working hard on, and that is in the Uruguay Round to try and  ensure that we get a reasonable outcome on agriculture out  of the Uruguay Round.  Because what's been an enormously  devastating thing for Australian rural producers,  who are  the most efficient producers in the world, is that they are  denied access to the large markets. I mean in Europe, North  America, but as bad as that is what's been even worse is the

export subsidisation by those trading blocs of their rural  producers which has meant that our more efficient producers  have been losing markets or suffering significantly reduced  prices in markets. Where if there were free competition we  would be doing very very much better.

JOURNALIST: South East forests. You've granted an extra  week for discussions before any decisions are made. Obviously the people on the South coast are extremely  concerned that this has been an ongoing problem. Will the  Government have a final solution by October the 8th?

PM: I hate the phrase final solution. The Federal  Government responded to a request from the New South Wales  Government for more time but we've made it quite clear that  the final decisions as far as we're concerned will be made  by the 8th of October.  This is an area where I want to get  an outcome which will get the proper balance that is  necessary for the community. That is the protection of jobs  and the making available of adequate resources, the timber

industry, getting that balance with the responsibility that  we have for this and future generations of having  ecologically sustainable development, as we put it. I hope  and believe that we will get the balance right.

JOURNALIST:  Jervis Bay is another environmental issue.  You've ruled out the fleet base relocation what about  disarmaments depot?

PM: There is further consideration of that matter going on  and again I hope that we'll be able to find a location which  matches the needs of the navy with the proper, consideration  that we must give to, the, environment,.-.There'  s further, work

going on on that.  I hope we'll be able to come up with an  acceptable solution. Â·  .

JOURNALIST: .  .  .  current account ... '  -liiirÂ·

PM: Just a minute the Current Account I'm back on here.

JOURNALIST: Financial markets believe that there is scope  with today's figure for an ease in interest rates by the  middle of next month and that would also help the rural and  the manufacturing sectors?

PM: When you say the financial markets believe, what’s the  financial markets. You mean certain people who purport to  speak for the financial markets express a view. Well that  they express that view is not surprising.

JOURNALIST: You don't think there's any room for an easing  ... in interest rates?

PM: I think that I have the responsibility as Prime Minister not to say anything which can influence the  movements in the markets because that's to no-one's  advantage. Let me say this, that in 1990 we've had four  discreet reductions in interest rates, four percentage  points in prime rates.  That is proof of the fact that this  Government in co-operation with the Reserve Bank authorities  has been prepared to give effect to the commitment we made.

That is that when circumstances were appropriate and we  believe we could safely move to reductions in interest rate  levels we would. Now we've given proof of our capacity and  readiness to do that during this year and we will follow the  same process, that if the circumstances are adjudged  appropriate and that we can responsibly further reduce rates  then they will be.

JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, you've just spoken to the local  unions. Their concerns are mainly unemployment.  Did you  make any commitment to them, especially on relocation ...  the tax office ...

PM: They've raised a number of matters, including that one.  I have indicated, as I have before, that I have sympathy  with them. That's not just ... of words.  I have sympathy  with them. I have more than that. I believe you know

something may develop in this area but I'm not prepared to  make a specific comment upon that now. Things are happening  in that area.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, an immigration issue, some of  the Cambodian boat people have been waiting up to nine  months. Is a decision on them forthcoming ...

PM: You say that some of the Cambodian people have been  waiting for nine months.  I can tell you my friend that  there are people in the refugee camps in Asia who have been  waiting years and years and years and years.  So, get.your. _  balance and priorities right.

.  JOURNALIST:  Prime Minister/ yet again holiday makers' air travel plans have been interrupted through regrettable  circumstances. Do you think this country's becoming more  sophisticated, is the union movement becoming more

sophisticated in its response to the problems that arise and

4 .

seem to influence people like the airlines where it's  directly not even their problem?

PM: Well, obviously when you have a problem like this it is  disturbing and I wish that it hadn't happened.  But you ask  whether the trade unions, plural, collectively are becoming  more sophisticated and responsible. If you were listening  to my brilliant address here today you would've heard one  part of it indicating that in the steel industry in this  region, in this year the level of industrial disputes is

five per cent of what that level was at the beginning of the  '80s which would be proved positive I would suggest of the  increasing sophistication and sense of responsibility of the  trade union movement. If you want to reflect that on an  aggregate level for the whole of Australia there has been a

59% reduction in industrial disputes since 1983. So yes the  evidence is overwhelming that the trade unions of this  country have become both more sophisticated and more  responsible.  They've accepted a shift in national income

away from wages to profits which has allowed a very  substantial increase in investment. Which will mean that in  the longer term Australia is going to become more  diversified and more economically able to insulate itself

from the devastating effects of wide swings in commodity  prices. Now having said all that you're still in a free  democracy where there is the right of industrial action.  You're going to have some exercises of that freedom which do

appear to be irresponsible and I think in this case you can  categorise the stoppage in that way. I think it's  particularly unfortunate that it's occurred at a time which  inflicts problems on kids and their holiday period. I don't

like that and I hope that it's very quickly stopped.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, a year ago we had the pilots  strike, the planes were down and the Government was quite  vocal then about ... Yet the Government has been very very  quiet about this latest round ... I mean I believe your  comments just now are the first you've made.

PM: Yes well, if you just sit down and think about ... and  if you believe that there's an analogy between what the  pilots were trying to do there and this dispute well I think  you really do need to do a bit more thinking.

JOURNALIST: In The Age this morning Mr Willis was quoted as saying that if oil prices remain high the Government must  look at some form of tax relief. Is he speaking out of  turn?

.  PM: Mr._Willis_. never speaks out of turn. '  ... ; j .  rr

JOURNALIST.:_So there is no likelihood of tax relief?: Ã¢ÂÂ

PM: That doesn't follow. You see, what you seem to forget,  I don't know why, is that we've been in office for seven and  a half years and we have shown in the whole of that period a  preparedness and a capacity to deal with changing economic  circumstances and make the decisions which are appropriate

5 .

to those changing circumstances. Nothing's new. If a  position arises where you needed to look at the level of  taxation because a new situation had arisen then the whole  of our record of seven and a half years shows that we'd be  prepared to do that.  But I 'm not going to speculate at this  point that the circumstances as they exist now require that  decision.

JOURNALIST: Just to bring it down to a local level ...

PM:  You pay taxes here too don't you.

JOURNALIST: You made a commitment today to look at the  report.  Do you think we might get another commitment of  some dollars and cents in the short term?

PM:  I don't know about the short term but I think I 'm  entitled to look the citizens of Illawarra directly in the  eye and say well you look at Bob Hawke's record, has he got  a commitment to this region, does he take seriously the

proposals that are put up? I think the answer is yes. I  think this is a very good piece of work that has been done  and I will not only look at it closely myself but I will see  that it's examined by all relevant Ministers and  departments. I say this, if there are ways that we believe  that we can positively respond to proposals that have been

put and that we can responsibly do that then that will  happen.

JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, have you made any commitment to the  South Coast Labour Council on approaching the Greiner  Government over building projects like Caloola Pass?

PM: I think any discussions I've had with the Labour  Council at least at this stage ought to remain confidential.   But I have certainly listened to a range of matters that

they've raised. I think that they have put up serious  questions for consideration and I've given them an  undertaking that I will look at them. Obviously some of the  things that they've raised are more within the area of State  Government responsibility. I'm prepared to raise them in  that context too. But my first reaction will be to go back  and talk with my Ministers who have a responsibility in the  areas where the issues have been raised.

JOURNALIST: Millions and millions of dollars worth of  projects. I mean there was one for example out at Brandon  Park, they said $600,000, way too much. You haven't got  that sort of money.  I mean we're talking about millions of  dollars .here.  Where '  s the..money going to be coming from?

PM: Well the money that governments provide comes out of  the pockets of taxpayers.  That's where the money comes  from. I haven't got a mint that I just create money. State  governments really haven't got it. Where the money comes

from is out of the pockets of taxpayers.  The responsibility  of governments is to get a proper balance between what you  expect the taxpayers will pay and what you understand

6 .

taxpayers want expenditures outlaid on. That's what  government is about. You've got to try and get your  priorities right. I think that at the Federal Government  level we have. I'm not altogether sure as far as this  region is concerned that the State Government has.

JOURNALIST: So some of these would be pie in the sky?

PM: Well I don't think any of the things that have been  raised with me are pie in the sky.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, Bob Hogg said the other day  that he thought that there should be more open forums and  would like in one way to address the leadership crisis, the  membership crisis ...

PM: He said, Bob Hogg certainly thinks there's no  leadership crisis. He's very happy with what he's got.

JOURNALIST: Do you agree with the idea for more open  forums?

PM: I'm always in favour of open forums.  But I think  really that as far as the Labor Party is concerned if you  look at the political parties in Australia we're the open  forum party. I mean we couldn't be more open. We do it at

length. I would always support Hogg or any other operative  in the Party who was calling for more discussion. I don't  think you can ever have too much of discussion of issues.  This recent exercise that we've had was invigorating I think  in that at the industrial and political level the discussion  went on for a very considerable period.  We refused to  pre-empt the discussion at the early stages by having a  Cabinet decision. We waited till the very end ... discharge

the responsibility we had of saying what the Government  position was.  In the process I think the Party came through  it well. The important thing on that particular issue is  that we will go into the next election with an absolute  dichotomy between Labor and the conservatives because Labor  remains totally committed to a competitive

telecommunications system within which there is a fully  publicly-owned telecommunication facility operating  internationally and domestically. The others want to  dispose of that absolutely and to put it totally into the  hands of the private sector as I've indicated. That's a  debate. You talk about open forums.  I'll be debating and  arguing that at the Tories for all the time between now and  the next election.
