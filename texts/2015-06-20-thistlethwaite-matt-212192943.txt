E&OE TRANSCRIPT  TELEVISION INTERVIEW  SKY NEWS SATURDAY AGENDA  SATURDAY, 20 JUNE 2015

SUBJECT/S: Paying People Smugglers, Iran Travel Advice, Tony Abbott’s  Royal Commission.

DAVID LIPSON: The people smuggler bribery row with Indonesia has escalated with  new claims Indonesian Police were also paid off to allow the boat at the centre of the  dispute to set sail. Joining me now to discuss this Liberal MP Alex Hawke and  Shadow Parliamentary Secretary for Foreign Affairs, Matt Thistlethwaite. Good  morning gentlemen I might start with you Matt Thistlethwaite this would hardly be the  first time that this has happened if it’s true but still the allegations aren’t likely to ease  the tensions with Indonesia.

MATT THISTLETHWAITE, SHADOW PARLIAMENTARY SECRETARY FOR  IMMIGRATION & FOREIGN AFFAIRS: Well there can be no tolerance for bribery or  corruption in any government, that’s why tax payers expect their governments to  show integrity, to spend government resources wisely so there can be no tolerance  for that in any government but we’ve seen this week allegations made by Indonesian  Police about the Australian Government paying people smugglers to turn boats  around on the water and that’s creating a dangerous incentive we believe for people  smugglers in what’s an illegal activity and the Government needs to explain that.

LIPSON: We also heard claims this week that Labor in government had paid people  smugglers to disrupt their operations.

THISTLETHWAITE: Well Labor didn’t pay people smugglers to turn boats around on  the water and anything else is pure speculation David but what we do know is that  the Indonesian police have made these allegations, that’s created a very dangerous  incentive because they’re not out in the open and people smugglers would now know  that there’s a possibility if you take a crew of people towards Christmas Island  there’s the chance that you’ll be paid to turn that boat around so they’ve created a  dangerous incentive and I think it’s now up to the Government to say whether or not  this has occurred and if it has to try and shut it down.

LIPSON: Alex Hawke, Julie Bishop wrote a letter to her counterpart Retno Marsudi  in Indonesia but the Indonesian Foreign Ministry says it provided no information so  they can’t be blamed for assuming that payments were made on the open seas.  Does Australia owe Indonesia a further explanation at all?

ALEX HAWKE: Well look I mean the first point to make about this situation is that  the Australian Government’s maintained for a long time now that these on water  matters, these operational matters that involve intelligence and security agencies  aren’t matters that the Government comments on, that’s a principle under the Labor  Government and a principle under the current Government. Now the Foreign  Minister also made a good point to Indonesia, that is Indonesia is responsible for its  sovereignty and the sovereignty of its own borders just as we’re responsible for the  sovereignty of our own borders so for Matt Thistlethwaite to say that there’s incentive  and evidence and speculation about what is happening now but he won’t answer any  questions about what happened under his Government it simply doesn’t stack up  and I think the Australian people can see through what is happening here. Now no  government comments on these matters quite rightly in my opinion because they  involve very serious matters of operational security so I think the principle…

LIPSON: So you believe we don’t owe Indonesia any further information about this  as a result?

HAWKE: Well the Government will continue to work with Indonesia as it has been  under the Labor Government and under the current Government to do its best to  work through all of these matters, sovereignty of our borders, but Indonesia’s  responsible for its sovereignty and its borders and we’re responsible for ours and we  make no apology for being very strident in defence of our own sovereignty and our  own sovereign borders.

LIPSON: Matt Thistlethwaite one of the claims today in the report by Greg Sheridan  in the Australian is that when this people smuggler boat was intercepted the seas  were rough, the crewmen were determined to head to New Zealand at all costs, and  that the Australians involved didn’t think that the boat would actually make it  anywhere near New Zealand, the passengers would they thought end up in the sea  and the suggestion was that they gave all priority to safety of life at sea. With that in  mind does that ease your concerns about these claims that bribes were paid to turn  the ship back towards safer waters?

THISTLETHWAITE: David there’s a very big difference between operating and  ensuring the safety of others at sea, that’s a requirement under international  maritime law and then giving people money particularly large wads of US dollars,  that potentially does in the eyes of the Indonesians amount to bribery, and that’s  something that I think no Australian would like to see our Government involved in,  and certainly does harm the relationship with Indonesia so it’s something that I think  the Government if it is occurring does need to shut it down.

LIPSON: Matt how do you rate the relationship with Indonesia now that this  Government has?

THISTLETHWAITE: Well I think that it’s at the lowest point its been for many, many  decades. We’ve seen in the past the former Indonesian Foreign Minister Marty  Natalegawa have to come out and explain what had occurred in a private meeting  between himself and the Foreign Minister Bishop after the Foreign Minister Bishop  had attempted to verbal Marty Natalegawa about what had actually occurred, we’ve  seen ongoing tension between Australia and Indonesia over a number of issues  most notably turn backs -

LIPSON: You said it’s worse in many, many decades, you mean its worse for  example after the East Timor vote, when Australia went to the rescue of the  Timorese?

THISTLETHWAITE: Well we’ve seen constant tension since the Abbott Government  was elected and on water operations…

LIPSON: But do you stand by the claim of many, many decades, it’s worse?

THISTLETHWAITE: Yeah I do believe it is, on water operations, these turn back  issues have created tension between our nations and this is as a direct result of the  policies of the Abbott Government, it’s one of our most important regional neighbours  and when we talk about ensuring that we’re working within our region to tackle  issues such as people smuggling, and trans-border crime, it’s important we have a  strong working relationship with Indonesia.

LIPSON: Alex Hawke, Tony Abbott did say he wanted to have a Jakarta not Geneva  approach when he came to Government. Perhaps your thoughts on the state of the  relationship in response to Matt Thistlethwaite.

HAWKE: Well the relationship with Indonesia is strong, it’s one of our most important  relationships, I think what Matt Thistlethwaite said is correct I mean things have  diminished but the Prime Minister has had a relentless Jakarta focus and the reason  its diminished is because Indonesia of course took a very unprecedented decision to  execute two of our citizens and you know the Australian Government has a firm  position against the death penalty and inevitably you’re going to see a diminishment  of relations between two countries when you have such a severe disagreement over  something so serious governing the matters like lives of our citizens, now without  sanctioning any of the crimes that those two young men committed the Australian

Government unashamedly adopted a strident position against the death penalty and  I think we all agreed with that including Matt Thistlethwaite but of course you’re going  to see some diminishment in the relationship because of that, it was a very tense  time, a very tense period and I don’t think anyone would blame Tony Abbott, no one  would blame Julie Bishop, no one in their right mind would say any Australian  Government should take any other position than to be extremely strident when the  Indonesian Government, when the lives of our own citizens are at stake.

LIPSON: What about Australia’s policies though, have they impacted on the  relationship do you think?

HAWKE: Well certainly advocating against the death penalty when a presidential  decree is to execute…

LIPSON: But apart from that one I mean on asylum seeker turn backs, spying claims  and alike?

HAWKE: Well sure we can talk about those issues but there’s been no bigger  disagreement between the Indonesian and Australian Government than over the  execution of two of our citizens and we’re stridently against it, nothing bigger, and  you can’t say there’s been an overriding issue, that has been the prime issue  between our two nations over the last 12 months.

LIPSON: At the same time relations with Iran seem to be getting warmer, they were  once regarded as part of the axis of evil, it wasn’t that long ago, now we see that an  agreement on sending asylum seekers back to Iran who failed in their claims in this  country is pretty close, there are reports that one of the things that is being  considered by Australia in return for them accepting asylum seekers is us toning  down the language of our travel advice. Matt Thistlethwaite is that appropriate?

THISTLETHWAITE: Well at this point in time this is a media report David and we  would seek a briefing from the Government about the reasons for this change in  approach but naturally I think the Opposition will take a sceptical approach, this is a  very unstable region within the world, the Iranian Government in the past has  supported Bashar al-Assad, it has a number of known Al Qaeda operatives that have  sought shelter in the country so I think it’s reasonable for the Opposition to take a  sceptical approach and to ask the Government to justify why this change in policy.

LIPSON: But you won’t oppose it at this point even though it is just reports that the  Government is considering included travel advice and the strength of the language in  those negotiations, you’re ok with that as a principle?

THISTLETHWAITE: We’d need to talk to the Government about the reasons why  they’ve made this decision and it needs to be justified and most importantly of all  David we need to be satisfied that the safety of Australians will not be compromised  in any way by this change in policy.

LIPSON: What do you think Alex Hawke, is that reasonable, is that something we  should be considering, and are you comfortable fully with a thawing of relations with  Iran in this space, asylum seekers?

HAWKE: A difficult issue but obviously the Australian Government is within its rights  to work with countries within our region and broader internationally to stop people  smuggling and to stop source countries where we have a lot of the problem  occurring, I think Matt is right I mean people are re-looking at this issue of our  diplomatic relations with Iran for a number of reasons I mean here I am sitting in  Sydney very close to the Lindt CafÃÂ© and one of the things that we’re hearing about  Man Monis was that the Iranian Government warned us about Man Monis that he  was not a genuine refugee and he was someone of danger to our country and  Australia generously took Man Monis into our country and we ended up having a  very tragic terror incident so things aren’t as black and white as saying well Iran will  always be bad, Iran will always lie to us, in many ways our country would wish we  had listened to the Iranian Government’s advice long ago about Man Monis and we  would never have had that problem. I think the Australian Government’s well within  its rights to work with countries in our region, countries around the world to say lets  stop people smuggling in general and any country that wants to participate in  stopping people smuggling I think is helping.

LIPSON: And what do you think Alex about the principle of having travel advice on  the table in negotiations over returning asylum seekers?

HAWKE: Well I have no data about that, I hopped on the website this morning, the  travel advice hasn’t changed from the Australian Government, I’m not aware it is on  the table for discussion, as Matt said I will monitor events, I don’t believe that any  Australian Government would use travel advice as a diplomatic tool, I think travel  advice will always reflect the best available judgement and intelligence of Australian  authorities about people travelling to different countries but this is a very different  question about a diplomatic relations where we have source countries and trying to  do whatever we can in source countries I mean recently in Burma we’ve heled with  funding their to stop much of the refugee problem at its source providing millions of  dollars in humanitarian aid, this is another tool in our armoury working with countries  within our region to stop people smuggling at its source.

LIPSON: Want to turn to the Royal Commission into Union Corruption and Fairfax  reports this morning that Bill Shorten’s former wife has been asked about some of  her share dealings when she was married to Mr Shorten. Matt Thistlethwaite is that a  reasonable for those sorts of questions to be asked?

THISTLETHWAITE: Well this story this morning David I think just proves that this is  a very, very expensive witch hunt, it’s not about improving the safety of workers in  particular industries, it’s not about improving the efficacy of the way our workplace  relations system works, it’s all about trying to damage the reputation of Bill Shorten  and other figures within the Labour movement and the fact that -

LIPSON: But this enquiry has come from the Royal Commission itself, not Mr  Shorten’s political opponents.

THISTLETHWAITE: Yes but it was Tony Abbott that set this Royal Commission up  with a very strong view I believe that this was about trying to damage the reputation  of Bill Shorten and other leaders of the Labor Party and the labour movement.  There’s no objective reason I believe why you’d be looking at the affairs of a wife, Bill  Shorten’s former wife, it just proves to me that this is really a political witch hunt and  a very expensive one at that, $80million of taxpayers money wasted on something  that at the end of the day I don’t believe is going to improve how our industrial  relations system works.

LIPSON: Alex Hawke do you think it’s reasonable to dig up Mr Shorten’s past in this  way, it does relate to the alleged share dealings that he had at the time.

HAWKE: David this is absolutely incredible what Matt Thistlethwaite is saying that he  says in one hand in the same interview that we should look into corruption and  bribery and yet somehow the union movement is completely sacrosanct and  somehow above reproach, now we know in recent years that unions have become  like major corporations dealing with hundreds of millions of dollars, poor workers  money in many cases, and what we’ve learnt that because there isn’t suitable  governments of unions, there aren’t suitable standards, there aren’t the requirements  of large corporations on them that the dealings of unions are very much in question.  Where does the money go? What is it used for? And how does it benefit workers are  absolutely legitimate questions for the Royal Commission to be asking and in their  asking them this Royal Commission is exposing there are serious questions about  very large amounts of money that do need to be answered and Bill Shorten has  questions to answer there is no doubt about it not because of anything the Liberal  Party has said or done but because he is administered unions under which some of  these practices as Matt Thistlethwaite said earlier in this interview bribery, corruption  people should answer and be transparent, well let’s be honest and transparent with  what’s happening with our unions because if our unions are sick, if they are not up to  standard then workers will not benefit from it and we are seeing now evidence of  agreements where workers have been left short by union leaders for substantial  sums of money, and I think people do want to know, I think union members who give  over their hard earned money to the union do want to know the answers to these  questions, where do these payments go? Who benefits from these payments? And  are payments to unions at the expense of union agreements for workers… there’s  very much evidence in the AWU that this might have been the case…

LIPSON: I just wanted to get your thoughts just quickly, on the specifics of the John  Holland deal which Tony Shepherd says was the best that he’s ever seen, save the  company hundreds of millions of dollars and was delivered five months early, it  sounds like the sort of deal that you would support doesn’t it?

HAWKE: Well not if it’s for an extortion payment, David and that’s the different here  and why can’t our industrial relations system be about agreement and consensus  and productivity like that example all of the time, why should it have to be on the  basis of an under the table payment to a union, that’s the question that’s being asked  and our economy, our society can’t operate on that basis, there’s nothing wrong with  deals and agreements between employees, unions and workers and I’ve always  been an advocate of saying unions in this country need to actually wake up and  realise that they are not against employers, they should be working with them to the  benefit of workers and that’s what’s gone wrong in this country but of course what  we’ve seen is that to do business in this country you’ve basically got to stump up a  wad of cash and give it to someone. The questions have to be asked, what is that  money for? Where did it go? And what did it do for workers?

LIPSON: And those no doubt will be asked when Bill Shorten appears before the  Royal Commission on July 8. Matt Thistlethwaite and Alex Hawke, thank you for your  time.
