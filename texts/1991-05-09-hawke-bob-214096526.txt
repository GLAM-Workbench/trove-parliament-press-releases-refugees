PRIME MINISTER

CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY

SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER  PARLIAMENTARY DINNER IN HONOUR OF THE  PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF TURKEY, MR TURGUT OZAL CANBERRA - 9 MAY 1991

President Ozal and Mrs Ozal, Distinguished Guests, Ladies and gentlemen,

Tonight marks a watershed in the history of relations  between Australia and Turkey.

Mr President, you are the first head of State of the  Republic of Turkey to visit this country,  and as such you  are a particularly welcome guest in Australia and in  Canberra.  It is indeed an honour to have you here, and it

is a pleasure to be able to return the hospitality that you,  and the people of Turkey, so generously extended to me and  to the large party of Australians who visited your country  in April 1990.

That visit, as you know, was centred on the 75th Anniversary  of the Gallipoli campaign.

With the Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the  National Party, I was privileged to visit the shores of  Anzac Cove and the heights of Lone Pine - and to do so in  the distinguished company of a number of Australian veterans

of the Gallipoli campaign - original ANZACS who despite  their advanced years embody still the courage, the  endurance, the good humour and the sense of service that  today represents, for all Australians, the best of the ANZAC  tradition.

Mr President, Turkish and Australian soldiers endured great  hardship and made great sacrifices in the almost  unimaginably difficult campaign that began on 25 April 1915.

It is commonplace to speak of such campaigns as 'senseless1   - and certainly, we must ensure that never again will the  nations of the world engage in such costly and short-sighted  conflict.

2.

But it is clear too that those of us on whose behalf that  terrible price was paid not only honour our predecessors -  we also recognise that their sacrifice was not in vain.

For Australians, Gallipoli was our coming of age as a nation  - a traumatic experience that taught us, and proved to the  world, the quality of our character and the magnitude of our  potential.

For Turkey,  the campaign was also a milestone on the road to  nationhood; the leadership and skill displayed by Kemal  Atatiirk in defending his homeland at Gallipoli paved the way  for his building of the modern state of Turkey.

It may seem paradoxical that a war should lie at the base of  the warm and generous friendship which now exists between  us. But the strong bond between our two countries is a  tangible fact of contemporary life, not merely an artefact  of history.

That truth was so vividly shown last year at Gallipoli,  personified by the emotional reconciliation by veterans of  our two armies.

Mr President, it was because of your own role, through that  visit, in developing relations between Turkey and Australia,  that you were invested yesterday as an Honorary Companion of  the Order of Australia. We congratulate you on that award.

Mr President,

On Anzac Day this year, we in Australia saluted our veterans  of another war - the Gulf War.

Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on 2 August last year posed a  direct threat to the basic principles of international order  which we uphold. It threatened to take from our grasp the  great hopes which we held, in the wake of the Cold War's

conclusion, for a saner and safer world.

Saddam Hussein violated those principles - but he faced a  world newly but tenaciously committed to upholding them.

It was in the most basic sense an issue that affected all  nations - Australia, distant from the Middle East/Gulf  region; Turkey, immediately proximate to it and a neighbour  of Iraq.

Australians are proud of the contribution that we made to  the success of the multinational response to this challenge.

Proud as we are, Mr President, it is a matter for deep  satisfaction to be able to tell you how much we appreciated  and respected the contribution of Turkey to our common

cause.

3.

As a front-line state, Turkey's role in achieving a  successful outcome was critical; its support for the  multilateral coalition was vital.

By actively supporting the sanctions regime imposed on Iraq,  Turkey suffered much more than most - in particular, through  the crucial closure of the pipeline carrying Iraqi oil to

the Mediterranean. Later, when it came to war, Turkey's  assistance to allied military efforts helped ensure their  success, and helped shorten the conflict.

Although the war itself is over, there remains much to be  done before we are able to say that peace and stability has  returned to the region.

The spirit of multinational cooperation which reversed  Iraq's aggression in Kuwait must be sustained and entrenched  if we are effectively to tackle and to resolve the  deepseated problems of the region and of the global  community.

Foremost in our minds is the plight of the refugees fleeing  persecution in Iraq. The outflow of refugees from Saddam's  regime provided yet another challenge to the world. Australia has played its part in the global endeavour to

contain the massive dimensions of this human tragedy. Again, however,  it must be recognised: Turkey's contribution  to the handling of this new crisis has been vital.

Beyond this profound humanitarian challenge lies the great  question of how to so order the affairs of the world as to  build on the progress of recent years - the conclusion of

the Cold War; the warmer superpower relationship; the  negotiated agreements for disarmament; the resolution of a  number of regional conflicts; the upholding of the Charter  of the United Nations in the Gulf War.

Middle power diplomacy, which we both practise, will be a  key element of the foundations upon which such progress can  be constructed - and Turkey, at the crossroads of Europe and  the Middle East, is well placed to contribute to both

regions during the years ahead.

There is cause to hope that the spirit of cooperation  witnessed during recent months may pave the way for a  broader understanding of the possibilities of cooperation.

But there will be no easy solutions to the long-standing  problems which remain.

Mr President

Without doubt one such issue is the dispute in Cyprus.  As  we discussed in our talks this morning, this is an issue on  which Australia and Turkey differ.

4 .

As you know, Mr President, Australia has consistently upheld  UN Security Council resolutions 541, 550 and 649. We uphold  the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of  Cyprus. We have consistently expressed opposition to the

unilateral declaration of the Turkish Republic of Northern  Cyprus in 1983.

We have also been extensively involved in efforts to restore  peace in Cyprus through our assistance to the United Nations  peacekeeping force. Our position is that all parties should  achieve a solution in accordance with the mediation of the

United Nations Secretary-General.

Mr President, we fully recognise your important personal  role in these issues and the consistent support that you  have expressed for a resolution of this problem in  accordance with the principles articulated by the United  Nations Secretary-General.  We recognise Turkey's interest

in and influence on this question, and we urge all parties  to participate constructively and openly in inter-communal  negotiations.

In our discussions this morning I also raised Australia's  concerns about reports relating to human rights in Turkey. As you know Australia takes a consistent approach to human  rights world wide.

While noting our concerns,  I also acknowledge your own  personal efforts to improve human rights in your country,  including the recent package of important legislative  reforms, which we see as an important positive move on this

issue.

Mr President

Yesterday you inspected the Snowy Mountains Scheme, to see  whether it can help you with the Greater Anatolian Project  underway in Turkey.

Australia has the experience and expertise in engineering,  irrigation and agricultural technologies available to assist  Turkey in that project if you wish. There is the potential  for benefits to be derived by both countries. Austrade has  already received the support of the Turkish Government in  assisting with the provision of services and technology to  the project.

In trade too, there is the potential for further expansion.  Both our Governments have achieved substantial restructuring  of our national economies, to make our countries more  efficient and effective competitors in international  markets. I pay tribute to your own leadership in the

process of reforming the Turkish economy.

5.

The liberalisation of international markets is essential to  both our economies. Like Australia, Turkey has suffered  from the distortion of third country markets, resulting from  EC and US export subsidies. We are well aware of the  potential for stagnation of the world economy, and for the

strangulation of our own economies, should these policies  continue. We urge EC leaders to show the political will and  strength to reach a satisfactory resolution of the Uruguay  Round. The wellbeing of both our countries depend on this.

Mr President,

For all the importance of the other issues I have discussed  so far, the links between our two countries are best  exemplified and maintained by the presence in Australia of a  large and vibrant Turkish community.

Australia is proud that, in particular since World War II,  we have attracted to our shores millions of new settlers  from more than 130 nations around the world.

In 1967 Turkey and Australia signed an agreement to  facilitate the migration of Turks to Australia. Some 40,000  Turkish people have since come to settle in Australia.

Let me say Mr President that these new members of the  Australian community are welcome among us.

We have been enriched by their contribution to our  multicultural society. And we respect the way in which they  have contributed to our society and economy while also

keeping alive the traditions of the Turkish language and  culture.

That thousands of Turkish settlers have realised their  dreams for themselves and their children in this country,  while carefully guarding their immense Turkish heritage,  should be, and is, a matter of great satisfaction to the  vast majority of the Australian people.

Mr President,

Australia is truly a land of immigrants. Well over one in  five Australians were born in another country. Over one in  ten Australians came to Australia from a country where  English is not the principal language. Overseas-born  Australians and their children now form some 40 per cent of  our population.

Within this diversity, it is important that all Australians  be able to express and share their individual cultural  heritage, to practise their religion, to speak their  language. It is also important that all Australians be  treated equally, without disadvantage because of race,  culture, religion, language, gender or other reason.

6.

Within this diversity, too, it is important that all  Australians unite around an overriding commitment to  Australia, to its institutions, its interests and its  future. There must be understanding and trust between our

many communities in Australia as we work and live together.

Integral to this vision of a multicultural society is the  political freedom of all Australians to express their views  - including their views about events in their old homelands.

But we do not see Australia as a place in which communal  rivalries and divisions of the old world should be played  out in a new community.

Certainly, Australia does not conduct its foreign policy on  any basis other than what we judge to be best for Australia  and for all Australians.

Mr President,

I have looked forward to your visit since my visit to Turkey  last year. I welcome this opportunity to discuss world  events with you and to advance the relationship between our  countries.

In once more welcoming you I express the hope that the  friendship between Turkey and Australia will continue to  prosper and to deliver increasing benefits to both our  peoples and countries.
