5 boat arrivals in 48 hours under Labor

In the last 48 hours we have seen 5 boats, carrying over 300 people, arrive illegally on Australia’s  shores, Shadow Minister for Justice, Customs and Border Protection Michael Keenan said.

“This unrelenting rate of boat arrivals continues to increase this Labor Government,” Mr Keenan said

“With over 14,000 people having been smuggled successfully across Australia’s borders this year  alone, it is clear that Labor does not have the necessary resolve to address this crisis of their own  making.

“The boats will continue to come whilst Labor continue to offer incentives that emboldened the  people smugglers.

"The greatest incentive being the continued ability for people smugglers to sell permanent residence  to Australia - an issue that a return to temporary protection visas would address.

"The Coalition has a proven track record of stopping the boats because we have always taken a  tough stance on border protection - something Labor previously vilified us for doing.

“It will take a change in Government to shut down this insidious trade in human misery and remove  the control of Australia’s borders from the hands of the people smugglers,” Mr Keenan said.
