$5 million to support resettlement of displaced persons in Sri Lanka

Australia will contribute $5 million to support the resettlement of internally displaced people  in northern Sri Lanka.

Australia has welcomed the end of the decades-long conflict in Sri Lanka: a conflict that cost  tens of thousands of lives and forced so many Sri Lankans from their homes.

Australia remains concerned, however, that over 250,000 people displaced by the conflict  remain in temporary camps, and supporting their resettlement will be a major focus for  Australia’s assistance in coming months.

The start of the monsoon season this month has increased the urgency for voluntary  resettlement and other solutions that provide freedom of movement.

To assist resettlement, Australia will provide $5 million through international organisations  such as the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the International  Organization for Migration (IOM).

This funding will include assistance for processing of documentation for internally displaced  people to facilitate their return, their assistance with essential items, including food and water  for travel and reintegration, and assistance to families hosting displaced people.

Australia welcomes the fact that the Government of Sri Lanka has committed itself publicly  to the resettlement task.

Australia has previously provided $5.25 million through UNICEF for emergency water and  sanitation and support services for children in the camps.
