EO&E...........................................................................................................................................



TONY ABBOTT:

The catalyst for this visit to Indonesia was the anniversary commemoration in Bali yesterday but this visit is  also importantly the result of discussions between myself and President Yudhoyono in Darwin a few months  ago. In those discussions, I affirmed my strong view that in some ways Indonesia is the most important  relationship that Australia has and my determination at the earliest possible opportunity to lead a delegation  of shadow ministers to Jakarta to deepen the relationship and to build the links between the Coalition and the  Government and people of Indonesia.

So, I’ve got with me Julie Bishop, the Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs, Scott Morrison, the Shadow  Minister for Immigration and John Cobb, the Shadow Minister for Agriculture. That should enable a wide  range of productive discussions to take place and to try to ensure that as far as is humanly possible, the  relationship between Australia and Indonesia is just getting stronger and stronger.

So, yesterday, after attending the commemoration, I visited Sanglah Hospital where I had spent a day in  2005 assisting with the evacuation of the Australian and other causalities from the 2005 bombing. I had a  light lunch with Mr Farshal Hambali, one of the Indonesian victims of that bombing, who I was able to help  evacuate to Darwin where he underwent three months of rehabilitation and treatment and is now Virgin  Australia’s representative here in Jakarta. I then visited an orphanage which was in part funded through  Australian philanthropy. Today, I’m visiting an AusAid water project, an AusAid disaster co-ordination  centre. Tomorrow, I’ll be making some agricultural visits, having discussions with people in the cattle sector  and then having dinner this evening with senior business leaders. Monday will be basically a day of  meetings with senior representatives of the Indonesia Government - including, I’m pleased to say, President  Yudhoyono - and a speech to a luncheon of senior Australia business representatives here in Jakarta.

So, I very much look forward to this visit. Indonesia is certainly a pivotal relationship for Australia. I think  that Australians need to understand better just how much progress Indonesia has made, particularly over the  last decade. Along with India, Indonesia is the rising democratic power of Asia. It’s very important for  Australia and for our region that the relationship between Australia and Indonesia goes from strength to  strength and I hope this visit will help to make that happen.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, this visit has sort of come about very quickly and some of the people we’ve spoken to in the  Government have been unaware that you were coming right up until yesterday. Is that kind of visit fitting for  a relationship that you say is this important?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, as I said, the genesis of this visit was my discussions with President Yudhoyono in Darwin back in  early July. So, President Yudhoyono has known for quite some months of my firm intention to make this  visit and my enthusiasm for making this visit was based in large measure on his enthusiasm for having me  here. So, as far as I’m concerned and as far as the most senior levels of the Indonesian Government are  concerned, this visit has been quite a few months in the making.

QUESTION:

It’s unusual, as I understand it, for an Opposition Leader to meet with the President. Is that a signal, do you  think, from Mr Yudhoyono that he wants to build relationships with the future Prime Minister?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, President Yudhoyono is a man who fully understands the diplomatic correctness and he understands  that I’m not the Prime Minister, that Prime Minister Gillard is the leader of our country and he’s maintained  a very full and proper relationship with the current Prime Minister and with the current Australian  Government, but I think the relationship between Australia and Indonesia is mature enough and I think the  knowledge on both sides of the political realities in both countries is sophisticated enough for people on both  sides to be able to maintain good relationships with all significant political figures and certainly I’ve met in  Canberra with Aburizal Bakrie, who is likely to be a candidate in the next presidential elections here  Indonesia. I certainly intend to maintain the closest possible relationships across the board here in Indonesia.

QUESTION:

Some considered Mr Yudhoyono didn’t turn up yesterday to the Bali commemorations, some interpreted  that as a snub to the Government and to the Prime Minister and now he’s meeting you in Jakarta. Do you  think he’s trying to send some kind of signal?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, I wouldn’t see it that way and I think it would be a mistake to read too much into it. I think that the  presence of Foreign Minister Natalegawa who made a really gracious speech and lovely speech yesterday is  a sign that the Indonesians took the commemorations very seriously indeed. After all, there were many  Indonesians killed that terrible night as well as 88 Australians and the fact that the Indonesians put so much  effort into organising the ceremony, into ensuring that the ceremony was the greatest possible success, I  think, is a tribute to their respect for our country and, in particular, their respect for the 88 Australians who  died on that terrible night.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, what are you going to say to the President and the other dignitaries that you meet on Monday  about your tow back the boats policy?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, they understand that this is but one element in our policy and as President Yudhoyono and others in  Indonesia have said time and time again, Australia needs to “take the sugar off the table” and that’s why a

3



very important element in our policy is the restoration of temporary protection visas so that the people  smugglers don’t have a product to sell, they can’t sell to potential illegal boat arrivals the prospect of  permanent residency in Australia.So, the Indonesians are very well aware of our policy. They understand  that turning boats around is but one element of that policy and the last thing I’m coming to Indonesia to do is  to lecture. I’m coming here to listen, to learn and to indicate to the Indonesian Government that as far as I’m  concerned, Indonesia and its government should always be treated with respect and should always be dealt  with as a candid friend.

QUESTION:

But you’ve said it’s one part of your policy but you have in the past said it’s a central part of your policy.  Scott Morrison is here obviously and he has prosecuted that very hard and yet, you know, Marty Natalegawa  has said that it’s a backward thing. In 2010 he said it’s impossible and not advisable, he said it’s a chain, if  you start sending people back, where will it end? Johnny Hutauruk who is an important figure in the co-ordinated ministry for these issues said it would make it complicated at our end. It’s clear the Indonesians  don’t like that policy, that you’ve said is a central part of your policy. So, how are you going to deal with  that issue?

TONY ABBOTT:

I’m not going to preempt the discussions that I have over the next few days and I understand that there are  lots of things that are important to Indonesia, just as there are lots of things that are important to Australia.  We have our way of saying things, they have their way of saying things, but I am very confident that in  government, we would be able to achieve the levels of cooperation with the Indonesian Government  necessary to ensure that we stop the boats. Let’s face it, under Prime Minister Howard, those levels of  cooperation were there. I’m confident that under the next Coalition government we can have the same levels  of cooperation.

QUESTION:

But how are you going to make that happen?

TONY ABBOTT:

I’m not going to preempt the discussions. I’m confident that we can have the right levels of cooperation to  ensure that we do stop the boats.

QUESTION:

Mr Abbott, on beef, you’ve made it plain that you believe the Australian Government’s actions are at fault  for the reduction in the beef quota here. The Indonesians consistently tell us that they want a self-sufficiency  policy, that it’s their own internal policy that they want to increase beef consumption, so on and so forth and  we see the problem continuing. Do you acknowledge that that’s a difficult issue for the Indonesians as well  and that it’s not simply an Australian-created problem?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, I’m not here to go over former criticisms of the Government. Then again, I’m not here to resile from  them either. That was a very difficult period in the relationship between Australia and Indonesia and I think  that it had ramifications beyond that issue itself but nevertheless I’m not here to till old ground, as it were, to  blow life into old embers. What I want to do is to try to explore a way forward that will be mutually  beneficial for both countries. Now, one of the really interesting developments in Indonesia - of which, I  suspect, most Australians are hardly aware - is the tremendous economic advances that have been made here  over the last decade and the growing sophistication in lifestyle of so many Indonesian families. This is not a

4



third world country in the traditional sense anymore and as Indonesia grows and prospers, as more and more  Indonesian families become middle class families, inevitably their diet is going to change and beef is going  to be a bigger and bigger part of the Indonesian diet. Now, I think that it’s possible for them to be more self-sufficient and at the same time for Australia to have growing export markets in beef here as well. So, that’s  what I hope to explore and discuss over the next couple of days.

Thank you.
