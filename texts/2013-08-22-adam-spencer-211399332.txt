TRANSCRIPT OF PRIME MINISTER KEVIN RUDD  INTERVIEW WITH ADAM SPENCER  702 ABC SYDNEY   22 AUGUST 2013



E & O E - PROOF ONLY  _____________________________________________________________



Subjects: Paid Parental Leave; Debt and surplus; Treatment of asylum  seekers; Car industry assistance.  _____________________________________________________________



HOST: The famous quote “does this guy ever shut up?” came about during a  discussion of paid parental leave.  Do you concede that Mr Abbott’s scheme is  more generous than yours?

PM: What I will say about Mr Abbott’s scheme is that it is unaffordable and it is  unfair. If you are on $150,000 dollars a year out there, then yes it is more  generous than ours and it is also less affordable than ours for the overall bulk of  the Australian taxpayers.

HOST: Mr Abbott says that his scheme can be funded.  Most of it seems to be  quibbling about something in the vicinity of $1 billion dollars, in a Budget of this  size he’ll be able to find that money won’t he?

PM: You look at the actual numbers here. They have finally admitted that this is  $5.5 billion dollars a year.  That is not a small amount of money.  That is more  than the Australian Government pays each year in every form of childcare  assistance to each and every one of your listeners this morning - the childcare  rebate and other forms of assistance. So it’s huge.

Secondly, only last Sunday he said that this would be fully funded by a levy on  business, well the truth is he has admitted for the first time in the debate last  night that it can’t cover the distance. So therefore it means having to cut  elsewhere either in jobs, health or education to make up the distance.

So it’s unfunded, unaffordable and I really think though it’s unfair.

Last night Mr Abbott drew an analogy with the aged pension and he said that this  is a great social reform like the aged pension.

Well I think that says a lot about Mr Abbott’s priorities. The aged pension is a  huge reform for the nation brought in decades ago.  We provided the single  biggest increase in the aged pension back in 2009-10. But to equate this, which  gives millionaires access to $75,000 dollars for six months if they have a baby,  it’s just frankly unbelievable. That is why people’s sense of fairness is offended  by this.

HOST: When it comes to budgets and budget management, it was as late as  December last year that your side of politics finally conceded that we won’t have  a surplus in 2013-14. Until then it had been for a long time saying it would,  despite the Opposition saying you won’t hit surplus, many commentators saying  you won’t hit surplus, but until December last year, finally the concession we  won’t quite get a surplus. That’s been adjusted to a $1 billion dollar deficit, a $7  billion dollar deficit, a $14 billion…it now sits at about $30 billion dollars the  projected deficit - that is how much it has gone down from December last year  when you were insisting we could still make surplus. The last budget deficit was  $44 billion dollars, the forward estimates of deficits get up towards $100 billion  dollars, where is the proof that your side of politics is in control of the economy?

PM: Well it’s pretty basic Adam. Number one is that every major economy in the  world has been wrestling with challenges to their budget bottom lines because of  the impact of the global economic recession, government revenues around the  world have been falling, falling and falling…

HOST: But you were insisting during that time that you’d still make surplus,  saying: “We’ll make surplus, we’ll make surplus…” and you have missed it by a  mile.

PM: But the point I was making was one you asked about - the management of  the economy and the management of the budget, that was how you concluded  your question, that is what I am trying to answer here and that is, every country  around the world has been impacted by the global economic recession.  Every  budget around the world is under pressure because government tax revenues  have not recovered in the way in which people projected them to be and we are  not Robinson Crusoe there.

The second point is this, we really need to ask the question, why did we  temporarily borrow? The reason we temporarily borrowed was to prevent this  economy of ours Australia from falling into recession and producing mass  unemployment like you’ve seen elsewhere in the world.

So what are the measures? We’ve kept the Australian economy in positive  growth now for the last five to six years when the rest of the major industrialised

economies all went into recession.  Secondly our unemployment level now at  5.7% is less than half that of what you see in Europe today. Third one, when you  come to measures of our net debt and net deficit, these are the amongst the  lowest in the world.

You’ve just talked about the budget deficit standing at about 1.9% of GDP - well  the average across the major economies is something like 5.7% of GDP.

Now let’s put all of this into some context, so if you are arguing that we should  not have temporarily borrowed and allowed the recession to hit and tens of  thousands of small businesses to collapse and unemployment to reach double  digits which would have thrown it out into more than a million people out of work -  that’s the price you would have paid.

We are paying this back in a responsible and orderly fashion and in fact we are  doing it in a way which doesn’t cause the overall economy problems.

HOST: Mr Rudd on the topic of asylum seekers, you have promised years ago  that you wouldn’t lurch to the right. Under the current regime that your  Government is postulating, the PNG solution as it is called, unaccompanied  minors it is being reported in the papers today are soon to be sent to Manus  Island. When it comes to people who have been found to be genuine refugees,  can you point to anything in your policy that has a shred of human compassion in  it?

PM: Absolutely. We are under the obligations of the International Convention for  the Protection of Refugees, that’s out guiding principle here. Number two, under  the Convention we voluntarily settle in this country, 20,000 refugees from around  the world, from camps in parts of the world that most of your listeners would  never heard of.

HOST: No, but for those who arrive by boat, where is the compassion?

PM: Well, you asked about compassion at it implies to refugees, and I’m trying to  fill out the entire picture for you… The third point…

HOST: The solution that your Government’s advocating, people who arrive by  boat, where is the human compassion?

PM: Human compassion, Adam, lies in doing everything physically possible to  prevent thousands of people drowning each year, rather than hundreds at  present, by sending an absolute clear cut message to people smugglers that if  you send people to Australia by boat then they will not be allowed to settle in  Australia. That is the only way in which you undermine the people smugglers  business model, because if you don’t do that the numbers will go up and up and  you won’t have hundreds drowning each year, you will have thousands.

This is a hard decision - getting the balance right.

And also in terms of the proper assessment and treatment and handling  of  individual asylum seekers, we are meticulous in the application of the  requirements on us through the Refugees Convention and making sure that the  countries that we are cooperating with are themselves signatory to the  Convention. That’s our overall approach. It’s the right one. It’s a hard policy  decision and it’s certainly one which the entre Government, including myself has  struggled with in order to get the right balance. We believe we have.

HOST: Would it be fair to say that you have, quote ‘lurched to the right” on this  issue?

PM: I think lurching to the right would mean axing your obligations for refugees  around the world.

Do you know that Australia is the country which takes the third largest number of  refugees of all countries in the world through the humanitarian program and we  cooperate everyday with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in  camps in Afghanistan, in Pakistan, in east Africa and in the Middle East and bring  people who have been languishing those camps for three years, six years, nine  years, twelve years to Australia to form a brand new life and we help resettle  those people and we’ve increased that number from 12,000 a year to 20,000 a  year under this Government. That, I believe, is the right and humanitarian  response.

It’s also important from a humanitarian perspective to do everything physically  possible to stop people smugglers’ business model, that’s why our approach has  to be hard-line. We’re balancing compassion for refugees, bona fide refugees,  and a hard-line towards people smugglers. I believe that’s the right balance.

HOST: Can I ask you Prime Minister, on the topic of the car industry in Australia,  $500 million pledged for Holden - surely that is throwing good money after bad. If  anything the last decade has taught us in this country, it’s that subsidies for the  car industry end up with the car manufacturers then going ‘sorry, conditions have  changed, we’re out of here’.

PM: If you look around the world, Adam - it’s always important to put into context  what we do here.

HOST: No, but what happened specifically in Australia recent was Ford after  having had years of subsidies, saying ‘sorry, can’t do it, we’re out of here’. Would  you be surprised if in a few years Holden say exactly the same?

PM: No, what I’m going to, Adam, is exactly where our level of support for the car  industry fits against what people in our country would perceive to be successful  car manufacturers around the world.

Our total amount of support for the car industry in Australia adds up to about $18  a head per year; in Germany, that figure is $90 a head per year; in the United

States its $96 a head per year, and we believe in Australia we need for our own  strategic purposes a vital car industry for the future.

Secondly, I’m not about to chuck a quarter of a million Australians on to the  unemployment scrap heap because a bunch of economic rationalists say ‘it’s not  right to support a particular industry’. Our support is modest. It’s one with co-investment from industry. It’s never going to be perfect. Mr Abbott says he's  going to pull all this away, and a reporter in yesterday’s press said that the effect  in Victoria alone would be to see 36,000 jobs go. I’m not about to stand idly by  while that happens, irrespective of what certain members of the Flat Earth  Society might be telling us.

HOST: Mr Rudd, best of luck in the rest of the campaign. Thank you for your  time.

PM: Thanks, Adam, for having me on the program.
