DR JOHN HEWSON, HP

TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW ON RADIO 3AW  WITH NEIL MITCHELL AT UNEMPLOYMENT FORUM

E & 0 E - PROOF COPY ONLY

SUBJECTS:  Unemployment, youth training, unions, reform.

Mitchell:

Dr Hewson, your reaction to the Prime Minister's statement.

Hewson:

It's a bit much from a guy that created the problem.

I'm disappointed Neil, as you know, that he won't attend  functions like this and he won't debate me on issues like  unemployment. But at least he's focussing his mind on it now and  I hope,  quite seriously, that something does come out of the  process.  I'm always very sceptical of talk fests, but I hope

that there is going to be sufficient public pressure on the  Government in the course of the next few months to actually do  something because the problem is much bigger than they are  prepared to admit.  And, in fact, in the course of this week, I  mean I was tempted to turn up today and say, "What are you all

Doing here, because the Prime Minister said the other day that  there really isn't a problem, the statistics are exaggerating a  problem." That isn't true, the problem is bigger than the

statistics.

Mitchell:

Well you've said that you could create 2 million jobs, is that  "polly" talk or is it a real chance?

Hewson:

No, I wouldn't have said it if I didn't believe it was a

realistic possibility.

Mitchell:

How?

Hewsonr

Well, I can give you plenty of examples, by industry if you like.  Let me just take one area which has got a lot of potential, which  is tourism. Now, we take 2.7 million tourists a year, 2.7  million. We could take 10 million by the Year 2000, a realistic  possibility. And for every - just let me finish I'm happy to

listen to you - for 25,000 tourists you create 1,400 jobs. So  we can create 400,000 or 500,000 jobs in the tourism industry  alone by the Year 2000. ,  Â·

Take another example, food processing. Food processing is an  area where we ought to have a major advantage into the Asia-  Pacific region.  The demand for processed food in that region is  growing at 18% a year in real terms.

Mitchell:

But are these realistic? They're ideas and they're areas to  target, but can they really turn up the jobs?

Hewson:

Yes. If you reduce costs in Australia and open up our tourism  industry, to stay with that example, yes, it's a realistic  outcome.

Mitchell:

How can you reduce costs with a 15% GST?

Hewson:

Well 15% GST takes costs off business.

Mitchell:

But it puts them on to the tourists.

Hewson:

Well the tourists pay taxes. Look it has a marginal effect on  the cost of a tour package, sure,  but they pay GST type taxes in  other countries that they go to, it will not discourage the  tourists from coming here. And the whole thrust of the GST is

to take taxes off business so that business can go on and create  jobs.  And abolishing payroll tax, for example - even the Prime  Minister admits that the abolition of payroll tax could create  200,000 job. There is a specific policy that they can do at a

Premiers Conference, they could agree to abolish payroll tax,

0006

REF: TRANSCR\0496\BQ 3.

200,000 jobs.  They're putting the Parliament today a

superannuation guarantee levy that'll cost upwards of 80,000 more  jobs, because it's just another tax on jobs.  And so if you go  through the system and you abolish some of those taxes, and  FightbackJ $20 billion worth of taxes, then of course you start  to create the capacity in business to employ people.  And that

is where the jobs have got to come from.

Mitchells

Ok, well this is about you answering the questions, not me so  much. Shane Healy has someone at the back for us.

John:

Hello Neil, hello Dr Hewson.

Hews on:

Morning.

Mitchell:

John, what is your position first,  are you unemployed?

John:

No I'm not unemployed, I'm a job trained lecturer/teacher, taking  students of which Bernie Griswald is one of my students.

Mitchell:

Ok, what's your question?

John:

Well students over the last 12 weeks have established in the  western community that there are a lot of businesses who do want  to help and support and give employment but are unable to because  of the lack of monetary incentives because of taxes, the liquor  commission and hotels and restaurants who can take people on, the  cost structure that they've got to put out are so enormous that

they cannot afford to take people on. So I'm training people but  don't have a resource where to put them.

So what the students and I have done is gone out and found a way  where we can help those businesses, the community and unemployed  people through job training and skills by a program project that  we've introduced.

Mitchell:

Ok, John, sorry your question?

n o n ?

REF: TRANSCR\0496\BQ 4 .

John:

If we show a way but what we've demonstrated and I've got letters  here of endorsement from businesses who believe that this is a  way to go, will the Government, the Local Shire Councils, -allow  us to show it to them without them throwing it back in our faces

and let us do what we've got to do - the people to make it work  for the people?

Hewson:

Sir, I think we should look at every idea in the current

circumstances and I'd be very keen to pursue with you personally  the detail of the proposal you are putting to see whether it can  work. There are a lot of rigidities in our system, in our wage  structures that stop people working, particularly young people,

and one of the things that were eliminated by the ACTU and the  Government in recent years were youth wages.  And to me the  single most important way to get young people back to work, for  example, is to offer the possibility of a youth wage, somewhere  above the unemployment benefit but below the adult award wage,  somewhere in that range and you'll see a lot more young people  employed in this country.

Mitchell:

Ok, Stephen Price has somebody for us.

Stephen:

We have got Bernie here Neil, who is an unemployed shearer.

B u m i e  :

Well the present Government and Opposition have failed to protect  Australians jobs. They've caved into the bank corruption, the  New World Order, we're controlled from overseas. And here's an  example of a sell out of Australians jobs to overseas. Through

the trans-tasman travel arrangement with New Zealand over 100,000  Australians jobs are now being taken by New Zealanders. Work  permits must be introduced to protect Australians right now. All  other foreign nationals have to have work entry requirements.

So my question to Dr Hewson is, do you support work permits or  New Zealanders wanting to take Australians jobs? Yes or no.

Hewson:

No. I don't, and let me tell you why, because I think it is

important that we recognise that we can build a large common  market with New Zealand which will create an awful lot of jobs  in Australia and our policy is committed to doing that. There  are some difficulties in some industries, but in aggregate I

think it's beneficial to Australia.

0008

REF: TRANSCR\0496\BQ 5.

>

We should look to integrate with New Zealand and build a bigger  market with Australian products and that's what we ought to be  on about, because that'll create a lot of jobs.

Mitchell:

Dr Hewson, the other thing that has come out today, is the  decision on penalty rates, do the unions have to give more, have  they got to drop their penalty rates principles?

Hewson:

I think we should have a system whereby at the work place you can  negotiate away penalty rates. I used the example before of food  processing as an industry, I looked at the penalty rates in food  processing the other day in Australia, New Zealand and the United  States and the loadings for afternoon work or evening work or  weekend work in Australia are draconian by comparison with New

Zealand and the United States.  For example, the weekend loadings  are 50 to 100%, in New Zealand and the United States they're  between 0 and 20%.

Mitchell:

With me, the alternative Prime Minister, the Opposition Leader,  Dr John Hewson, and we do have a question from the audience.  It  is Nancy from Ringwood.  Ã¢ÂÂ

Nancy:

Hi Neil, I'm unemployed for 12 months, I used to work at St  Henry's Hospital in St Hilda Road. And I'm asking Dr Hewson, I'm  from Ringwood area, unemployment from Ringwood area is 42.4%, why  can't the Government help the eastern suburbs of Ringwood?

Hewson:

the answer is that they ought to just get on with it, the jobs  can be created. There are plenty of ways we can start creating  jobs today.

Nancy:

I've got statistics from our local paper from yesterday, because  I look at our local for jobs, it's so hard!  I'm 21 and all

through Ringwood area and also the eastern suburbs, it's so hard.'  Why can't the Government come out to the eastern suburbs and see  how unemployment feels?

Mitchell:

Well Dr Hewson can't actually answer for the Government,  what  about the Opposition?

0009

REF: TRANSCR\0496\BQ 6.

Hewson:

Well we can start creating jobs today.  Abolition of payroll tax,  youth wages, cuts in immigration, other policies designed to  lower business costs, no more wage increases that are not matched  to productivity, all those decisions can be taken today.  Abolition of the superannuation guarantee levy - we can start

creating jobs today, it's there, the option is there, all you  need is political leadership.

Jrnlst:

Neil, I have got Ron from Mount Macedon wants to ask you and Dr  Hewson a question.

Ron:

Thank you Neil, Dr Hewson.

Mitchell:

Ron, first your position, are you unemployed?

Ron:

No, I had my own business for 16 years,  it's now gone under, it  was a very lucrative business.

Mitchell:

What industry?

Ron:

In the sound and quarry industry and I'm now a consultant of my  sons. But I heard Martin Ferguson the other say there is no easy  fix. Well, I believe there are plenty of easy fixes and I think  the first is that we start working, getting back to 40 hours,  getting rid of RDO's, getting rid of holidays we don't need other  than Christmas,  New Year, Easter. We can go on and on and on but

I think to take on the unions on this side, they don't want to  let go. But I think as Australians, when we have been down over  the years and there has been a few of them, we have come to the  fore, it's the ethos of Australians and the hallmark of our great  nation to pull together under conflict.  And I think this is one  of them where we've all got to say, well enough is enough, we've

got to start shaking at the foundations and there's many, many  ways in which we can rise above all this by just having a good  hard look at getting other people employed. They can see it that  all these young kids, what we can save out of these 17.5%

loadings, that we don't need.

0010

REF: TRANSCR\0496\BQ 7 .

Mitchell:

Ok Ron what you're saying is take on the unions, now that

inevitably leads to conflict ...

Ron:

But I can't see the conflict Neil ...

Mitchell:

They won't give it up easily, the penalty rate decision today.

Ron: ‘

Look it doesn't matter as long we're getting people employed.  What do we want? Do we want it the way it is? Or do we want to

get people employed? The other thing I was going to say, if I may ...

Mitchell:

Just before you do, we'll let Dr Hewson answer that part first.

Hews on:

I agree that our wage system, our union structure is one of the  biggest problems we've got in this country. I ask you a simple  question, how many union leaders have lost their jobs in the last  18 months compared to the rank and file workers that have lost  their jobs?

Mitchell:

How many politicians too?

Hewson:

Listen, I think politicians ought to lose their jobs if they  don't get on and create jobs for you, I agree with that too.

The gentleman's sentiment is right. Enough is enough. We have  to start and act today and the unions are as much of the problem  as anybody else. And I was amazed today to see that Mr Keating  is going to talk to Mr Kelty to see if it's alright to have a  youth wage. Mr Kelty has become a defacto Cabinet Minister in

this Government and that is one the principal reasons why you're  losing jobs. They're looking after their job but not your job.

Ron:

Neil, can I just follow up on that please.

0011

REF: TRANSCR\0496\BQ 8 .

Mitchell:

Yeah, very quickly.

Ron:

I believe this is very important,  that Dr Hewson's GST is bound  to fail unless we fix up the tax system first and by that I mean  that if we do a tax on our gross, so you are talking Dr Hewson  about a $40 billion black money going in, now the only way we can  stop that black money and tax it is to stop people cheating on  their tax in the first place. I know it is all legitimate, but  we've got to get rid of this mentality of going once a year to

our accountant and say, what's the best we can get around this  and not pay as much tax.

Mitchell:

Put the money into pig farms!

Ron: ‘

Put the money into funds, everybody pays tax and then you can  bring in your GST. Without that you're doomed to fail.

Hewson:

We do that.  We bring the GST in as we cut personal tax.  And

just to give you an understanding, we cut, personal tax by a third  and we give you almost a Hong Kong style personal tax system.  Somebody on average income, $25,000 a year or thereabouts will  pay 14 cents in the dollar tax, they'll keep 86 cents in the  dollar. They can double that income to $50,000 and pay 22 cents

in the dollar tax, keeping 7 8 cents in the dollar for themselves.  Now, quite frankly, you can't do much better than that as a tax  system to give you incentive and it'll stop a lot of what this  gentleman is talking about.

Also, his point about leave loadings and so on is very correct.   We pay ourselves more in this country, 17.5% more, to go on  holidays than we do to go to work and that is a major cost.

Jmlst:

It's Steve from St Auburn's, he has a question for Dr Hewson.

Mitchell:

First your position Steve, are you working?

0012

REF: TRANSCR\04 9 6\BQ 9 .

Steve:

Not full time any more, I was a full time employed person but  recently I was retrenched. I want to make something of myself  so I don't want to sit around and pick my nose every day.

Mitchell:

How old are you?

Steve:

30, so I decided to go out and try and make a business for myself  and get it going. To do that you need to register a business  name, you then go into Social Security and tell them and be  honest and be up front and they tell you sorry we can't give you  anything any more, so you're back to get nothing in income, so  that tells you go back on the Dole rather than work.

Mitchell:

Rather than get a business going? .

Steve:

Yeah, rather than get something going and create employment,  possibly in the future, and you get no assistance at all.  What  are you supposed to do?

Mitchell:

This keeps coming through Dr Hewson, the level of frustration in  dealing with government agencies is staggering. We have had so  many examples here already today of people who want to do the  right thing, want to work, it's not even a matter of money, it's

just a matter of a bit of help.

Hewson:

Well the system does, as the gentleman says, discourage you from  going into business or starting a business, building a business  and a lot of it is unnecessary government tape, red tape

particularly, but you've also got green tape and black tape all  around Australia which is holding up business projects.

And quite frankly, if you want some lateral thinking like the  gentleman up the back was advocating, where we've all got to stop  and change our attitude, why not say to Government, look as of  a certain date shouldn't all regulations and so on cease unless  there's a good argument for them to continue. Because there are  thousands and thousands of regulations that get built up over  time, at the local level, the State level, the Federal level, you

start a business you have got 50 or 60 approvals you've got to  get before you can walk through the door.

0013

REF: TRANSCR\0496\BQ 10.

Mitchell:

Can you do that?

Hewson:

Yes, we are looking at the feasibility of doing something like  that where all the relevant and outdated regulations are scrapped  at one point in time because there is just so much of that over  lap. And equally if it's a bigger development project, for  example, which gets caught up in this impact study and that  impact statement and this group and that group and so on, we  should put a finite time period, we should have a one-stop shop

for the approval and the process should be decided very quickly.  I agree the environmental studies have got to be done and other  things, but once they're done you've got to get a clear decision  otherwise you're never going to get into business.

Mitchell:

Sally, what's your position.

Sally:

I don't consider myself unemployed, a mother who works at home  and that's my contribution to society.

Mitchell:

A mother, how many kids?

Sally:

Two.

Mitchell:

Good on you, how old?

Sally:

Two and nine months.

Mitchell:

You work!  You work!

Sally:

Now there is one vital point that no one seems to have considered  with regard to the current unemployment problem. Did you know  that 69% of working mothers would prefer to be at home with their  children, if only they could? And that is a statistic from the

Australian Institute of Family Studies.  There is a way to give

0014

REF: TRANSCR\0496\BQ 11.

these women the incentive to take this option and that's to free  up those jobs for our unemployed, effectively reducing the  Victorian unemployment to below 4%.

Mitchell:

Ok Sally, can you just make the point on how that would happen?

Sally:

That would happen if we were able to give the mothers a

remuneration for their work.

Mitchell:

Mothers wage?

Sally:

At no cost. I've done a costing here, that I would like to

submit Dr Hewson, at no cost to the taxpayers.

Hewson:

I'd be happy to look at it. We've tried a bit in Fightback! to  target more money to mothers who stay home.  Things like family  allowances which are paid to the principal carer, which is  usually the mother, are doubled for families with incomes up to

$30,000 as an attempt to give you more financial freedom and more  choice. We also allow under superannuation for you to be part  of superannuation even though you're not in the work force.

Sally:

Employer contribution for mothers superannuation?

Hews on:

No, but as a family right now, you as a wife,  can't get access  to superannuation and your circumstances could change down the  track.  Our dependent spouse rebate is another way of giving you  money back in your pocket. Admittedly if the husband is a

taxpayer it goes into his pocket and I don't know what your  relation is like with your husband,  but at least it's an attempt  to get money back to families where the wife, usually the wife,  chooses to stay home.  Things like child care, expanded child  care places or more direct subsidy, some tax right off perhaps  to your family for child care would allow you to do some part  time work if you chose. Now that is some of the direction in  which we've got to go, but I'm happy to look at your particular  proposal.

0015

REF: TRANSCR\0496\BQ 12 .

Mitchell:

If you want to leave that down the front.  The relations with  your husband aren't too bad if you've got kids 2 and 9 months.

Shane: .

It's Steve this time from a delegation from the Australian  Workers Union today, Steve.

Steve:

Thanks very much.  Dr Hewson, I understand that the Liberal Party  policy is to cut immigration further as some sort of job

creation. Keeping that in mind, for one,  why does the Liberal  Party continue to support an open access policy where New Zealand  economic refugees, or guess workers, or whatever you want to call  them, can hold up to 200,000 jobs in this country?

And the second question is a bit more general in relation to the  union movement. Isn't it true that it was in fact the corporate  cowboys of this country that created the recession we're  currently in and not the working class people who have taken wage  cuts of up to 20%, .  .  .  (inaudible)  .  .  .  the corporate extravagance  of the sort of people that you represent?

Hewson: '

I think you'll find in relation to the New Zealand workers that  there are more New Zealanders going home these days than are  coming here because the opportunities in New Zealand are better  than they are here.

No, I'm making a serious point, I think there has been a tendency  in the last couple of years for New Zealanders to go back and get  work in New Zealand because they are becoming more competitive,  internationally competitive than we are.  Well we can easily  check the numbers.

On the second point, I didn't say that the workers had created  the problem, I said Mr Keating had created the problem and I have  no doubt that Mr Keating created the problem, he was certainly  in creating that problem aided and abetted by union leadership  which has stalled an enormous amount o f ‘reform that could have

taken place in this country, could have lowered costs and created  jobs.

Mitchell:

Do you accept the point that Steve is making that the average  worker has already paid a pretty heavy cost in reduced real  wages?

0 018

REF: TRANSCR\0496\BQ 13 .

Hewson:

The average worker has seen their living standards fall, yes.  The Accord process which was supposed to be in the interests of  the average worker has not been in the interests of the average  worked. It's been to the detriment of the average worker and  that ought to cause you to stop and ask, what is it that you are  attracted to in the Accord process, because it is discriminating  against you?

Mitchell:

I don't want to disenfranchise the listening audience we have,  I want to keep taking calls, because they're people who want to  get a message to you, allow they can't be here. Helen is on the  line in at the 3AW studios, Helen good morning.

Helen:

Good morning.  I'd just like to say that I'm an employee of my  parents small business, a cleaning company, and without them I'd  be unemployed, I'm 20 years of age. I find it extremely

frustrating, in fact insulting, that unions and government make  out that all employers of these, excuse the language, bastards  rolling around in their money and not giving a damn about their  employees. I'd like to get this much straight. My parents have  been working damned hard for over 15 years to establish this  business, and we were with nothing for 10 of those years to get

it going.  We need to be able to get mutual respect between an  employee and employer to give, well instead of creating and anger  and hostility, get co-operation, it just has to stop.

Mitchell:

What would you ask Dr Hewson to do if he became Prime Minister  to encourage that?

Helen:

The unions have such a stronghold, will that actually deteriorate  at all and allow small business to actually grow. Or is this  stronghold going to continue?

Hewson:

It won't continue under us. Bill Kelty will not be a defacto  Cabinet Minister in a Hewson Cabinet.

Mitchell:

Ok, thanks for calling Helen.  We are nearly out of time and Dr  Hewson has to get away at 10. I just ask you to perhaps, wrap  up Dr Hewson, within a minute or so. We have here people who are  looking for answers and very constructively, even from different

0017

REF: TRANSCR\0496\BQ 14 .

points of view, there is no question they're looking for help,  they're looking for answers, they're looking for hope.  What can  you offer them?

Hewson:

Let me just say a couple of things because I have spent a lot of  time over the last 2 years or so since I have been Leader of the  Opposition getting around Australia and talking to people in  unemployed circumstances, in SkillShare centres, community

agencies and youth homeless centres and so on. To try and  understand the problem, it is the most important problem in  Australia today, there are three elements to solving the problem.

The first is making ourselves internationally competitive, taking  a pro-business stance because that is where the jobs are going  to come from.  We can create 2 million jobs by the Year 2000 if  we really get on with it.

Two, we have to do a lot more about training.  We are making a  lot of square pegs for round holes, a lot of kids who can't get  into university, can't get into TAFE colleges, that system has  to be changed and it has be done at the TAFE level and at the  community level where I think a lot of voluntary agencies really  must play an expanded role in terms of training and we put more  money into that.

Thirdly, and I think very importantly, don't under-estimate how  big a problem this is. Under the sort of policies you've seen  in recent years, the unemployment rate is going to stay 8.5 to  9% imtij. the end of the decade and the human dimension of that  problem is horrific in a country like Australia. It will spin  off into family break downs, youth homelessness, drug abuse,  crime, violence.  #

We've got to act and we've got to act now or we're going to have  a spate of social problems in Australia like you've never seen  in the course of this decade and that human dimension is going  to call for all of us to take a completely different attitude and  to work with a sense of urgency. And I personally think that  government can only do so much in that area, a lot more is going  to be done by community service organisations,  the Brotherhood  of St Laurence, the Sydney City Mission, St Vincent de Paul and

so on, in terms of dealing with people.

We are about to put a whole generation of kids on the scrap heap,  we're going to leave them a lower standard of living than we've  enjoyed ourselves. That's intolerable.

0018

REF: TRANSCR\0496\BQ 15 .

Mitchell:

I think the people here would understand that from personal  experience.  Dr Hewson thanks for your time, thanks for coming  in, it's good to see politicians in the real world, we'll keep  in touch.  .

Hewson:

Thanks very much Neil.

Mitchell:

The Opposition Leader, the alternative Prime Minister, Dr John  Hewson.
