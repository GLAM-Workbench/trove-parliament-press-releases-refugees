MIGRANT RESOURCE CENTRE NETWORK FUNDING 
ANNOUNCED

Â

The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock, 
has announced funding of  $8.75 million for the Migrant Resource 
Centre (MRC) network for 1998-99.

Â

Mr Ruddock says the funding is necessary to help overseas-born 
residents, particularly humanitarian entrants and those who have arrived 
in Australia recently, settle into the Australian community.

Â

“Migrant Resource Centres offer a range of services 
for new arrivals to Australia, including multilingual information, and 
advice and referral services.

Â

“In addition, they assist in the development of 
specific services for migrants to meet local needs and promote awareness 
of such issues on a local level.

Â

“Importantly, MRCs also assist people settle into 
the community by providing a base for ethnic communities’ educational, 
cultural and social activities”.

Â

Mr Ruddock said core funding will be provided under 
new Service Agreements and Work Programs which focus on greater accountability 
for MRCs.

Â

“The new Service Agreements are a significant advance 
on former agreements and will allow my Department to more closely monitor 
MRC performance and link payments to outcomes.

Â

“We need to ensure that new settlers, particularly 
refugee and humanitarian entrants that may have been tortured or traumatised, 
can access services that are currently available to other members of 
the community.

Â

“Such service provision allows new arrivals to settle 
more successfully and make effective long-term contributions to our 
nation”.

Â

The national MRC network is comprised of 30 MRCs across 
all States and Territories and three outreach services.
