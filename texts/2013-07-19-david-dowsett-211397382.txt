E&OE……………………….…………………………………………………………………

DAVID DOWSETT:

Well, first up just a couple of weeks ago you were riding high on the polls, the country’s preferred Prime Minister. The Coalition

was riding high as well. Now, that Labor has caught up and you are no longer the preferred Prime Minister, you must be feeling  pretty gutted now.

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, David I always said that winning from Opposition was like climbing Mount Everest. I have always said that this is a

government which is hopeless at administration but brilliant at low politics. Look, they’ve done the same thing in Canberra that  they have done in New South Wales and elsewhere. They have tried to give a bad government a makeover with a new leader but

I think the public are alive to these Labor tricks and I am confident that when the election comes we will be very competitive.

DAVID DOWSETT:

Are you missing Julia Gillard?

TONY ABBOTT:

I suspect that a lot of people inside the Labor Party are because they had some respect for Julia Gillard, we know that when Kevin  Rudd became the leader again fully one third of the Cabinet refused to serve with him.

DAVID DOWSETT:

What about Kevin Rudd’s latest asylum seeker policy? What are your feelings on that?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, he doesn’t have a policy as such. He just has a bit of briefing to the media that there will be some sort of announcement  today. Look, Mr Rudd started this problem back in 2008. I don’t think he is the man to finish it. Mr Rudd has been thrashing

around like a fish on a deck of a boat on this one. Look, if he wants to make a difference he should just put in place the policies  that were proven to work under John Howard and the previous Coalition Government: temporary protection visas; rigorous

offshore processing for everyone who arrives illegally by boat in this country; and the willingness to turn boats around where it is  safe to do so.

DAVID DOWSETT:

But you must be a little bit concerned that he is in the process of maybe taking away a vote winner for you?

TONY ABBOTT:

If he can stop the boats I will applaud but he is not going to stop the boats. The one thing he can never do is re-introduce

temporary protection visas because he has a problem with the left of his own party. The other thing he will never be able to do,  even though he promised to, is to turn boats around where it is safe to do so. In the end the Labor Party lacks the will to do this.

He keeps deriding what he calls a three-word slogan - stop the boats. What does he propose to do because the only acceptable  outcome is to stop the boats. If you don’t stop the boats the tragedies keep happening and the people smugglers will keep taking

Australia and its people for a ride.

DAVID DOWSETT:

You announced a pot load of money for the Bruce the other day. Will that actually flood proof the Bruce though?

TONY ABBOTT:

It is going to make a very big difference and it is going to bring the Bruce Highway into the 21st century. In a big enough flood  nothing is flood proof but certainly this will make an enormous difference and one of the major projects is the Yeppen Flood Plain

which has taken out the Bruce Highway several times over the last few years for weeks at a time. So, it is going to make a very  big difference.

DAVID DOWSETT:

But why that money now? You were part of the Howard Government for ten years. Why not invest back then, why suddenly now?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, the Howard Government put more into the Bruce than the Hawke/Keating Government had done, yes the current

government has spent more than the Howard Government but there is more traffic on the road now than there was in the days of  the Howard Government. Each government needs to spend more. We are promising to spend $2.6 billion more than the Labor

Party, this Labor Party, this Labor Government and I say if they are fair dinkum about the Bruce they better match our offer.

DAVID DOWSETT:

What about money for flood mitigation? State Government has no more money, will the Coalition come to the rescue?

TONY ABBOTT:

We think that it is very important that the Federal Government doesn’t shirk its responsibilities under the disaster recovery  arrangements. At the moment the State Government has fully worked through and fully approved a proposal for $12 million of

disaster recovery dredging. Here in the Port of Bundaberg the application is sitting on Kevin Rudd’s desk. If Mr Rudd spent more  time at his desk and less time in the plane he would be able to sort this out. He needs to sort it out now. The sugar industry can’t

wait much longer and if Mr Rudd is the Queenslander that he says he is, he will get back to Canberra, he will get behind his desk  and he will actually approve this $12 million to sort out the Port of Bundaberg.

DAVID DOWSETT:

Would a Coalition government have a flood recovery minister?

TONY ABBOTT:

A Coalition government will do its job, it will do its job because I will do what is necessary to keep the wheels of government  turning. All we have got from the Prime Minister at the moment is a series of stunts. It is campaigning, it is not governing.

DAVID DOWSETT:

Just finally because I know you have to move on, unemployment big problem in the Wide Bay, NBN, it was hoped that the

National Broadband Network would help to create jobs. You have never been such a big fan of NBN have you?

TONY ABBOTT:

No, and the problem with the NBN is that it is going to cost $60 billion more than it should and because…

DAVID DOWSETT:

But if it creates job isn’t that good?

TONY ABBOTT:

It’s never good to waste money. It is never good to waste money and if you waste money you might create one job in one area but  you will lose two, three, four jobs in another area. The problem with the NBN is that there is a fundamental flaw at its heart. The

assumption that every premises needs fibre, whatever their usage, whatever their budget. The fact is some premises need fibre,  many of them don’t, there should not be an automatic fibre to the premise roll out at this time. That is what the Coalition can do it

much more quickly. We can deliver much faster broadband, much more quickly and much more affordably than Labor.

DAVID DOWSETT:

Tony Abbott, thanks very much.

TONY ABBOTT:

Thank you.
