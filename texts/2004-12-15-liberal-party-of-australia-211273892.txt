DIPLOMATIC APPOINTMENT: AMBASSADOR TO MEXICO

I have today announced the appointment of Neil Allan Mules AO as Ambassador for Australia to  the  United  Mexican  States.   Mr  Mules  will  succeed  Mr  Graeme  Wilson  who  has  been   Ambassador  since  January  2002.   Mr  Mules  is  expected  to  take  up  his  appointment  in  March   2005.

Australia and Mexico enjoy close and expanding relations.  Mexico is one of Australia’s largest  trading  partners  in  Latin  America,  with  bilateral  trade  of  around  A$1  billion  in  2003-04.    Commercial  links  were  boosted  by  the  entry  into  force  of  a  Double  Taxation  Agreement  in   January 2004, and we will conclude an Investment Protection and Promotion Agreement (IPPA)  in the near future.

Mexico is an increasingly attractive trade and investment destination for Australian companies  across a range of sectors.  The energy sector is extremely important, with coal being our largest  export to Mexico and with the potential for significant LNG supply from Australia.  Agriculture is  another pillar of our bilateral trade, particularly meat and dairy products.  Australia's export  profile continues to strengthen and diversify, as evidenced by a rapid rise in enrolments by  Mexican students in Australian education institutions, the introduction of a 20 peso polymer note  and sharply increased wine sales.  We are developing further bilateral cooperation in these and  other sectors, including through a Joint Trade and Investment Commission meeting and through  the work of the Council on Australia Latin America Relations (COALAR), which has sponsored  visits by prominent Mexican journalists and has promoted Australian goods and services.   Australia and Mexico are also partners in a range of multilateral fora, including the WTO and  APEC, and share a commitment to agricultural trade liberalisation.

Mr Mules is a senior career officer with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and served  as Head of the Australian Representative Office in Baghdad prior to being appointed as Australian  Ambassador  to  Iraq  in  June  2004.   Mr  Mules  has  also  served  as  Deputy  Head  of  Mission  in   Jakarta  (2002-03);  Counsellor  in  Hanoi  (1996-98);  Counsellor  in  Jakarta  (1992-95);  First   Secretary in Harare (1988-90); First Secretary in Ankara (1985-88); and Third Secretary and later  Second Secretary in Brasilia (1981-84).

In  Canberra,  Mr  Mules  was  First  Assistant  Secretary,  Diplomatic  Security,  Property  and   Information Management Division (2000); Assistant Secretary, Maritime South East Asia Branch  (1998-2000);  Director,  Conditions  of  Service  Section  (1991-92);  and  Desk  Officer,  Refugees,   Immigration and Asylum Section (1984-85).

Born  in  1954,  Mr  Mules  holds  a  Bachelor  of  Arts  degree  from  Flinders  University.   He  was   appointed  an  Officer  in  the  Order  of  Australia  in  April  2004  for  his  outstanding  service  as   Australia’s representative in Iraq.
