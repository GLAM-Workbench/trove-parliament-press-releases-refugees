MIGRANT SETTLEMENT FUNDING

John Forrest, the Nationals Federal Member for Mallee today invited community groups  to apply for Australian Government funding to assist migrants, refugees and  humanitarian entrants to settle in Australia.

“Settlement services help migrants and humanitarian entrants adjust to life in Australia  so that they can achieve independence and participate fully in Australian society,” said  Mr Forrest.

“Local service providers and members of the community are in the best position to  recognise local problems and develop local solutions.  As such I strongly encourage  organisations to apply for funds, given our increased population of migrants seeking  employment in the electorate.”

“The Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (DIMIA),  through the Community Settlement Services Scheme (CSSS), have allocated $14.5  million to assist people to settle quickly and effectively into the local community.”

For more information and applications for funds can be made on the DIMIA Website:  www.immi.gov.au/grants and close on Friday, 14 January 2005.
