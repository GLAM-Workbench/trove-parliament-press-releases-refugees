Tuesday, 31 March 2015

The Minister for Immigration and Border Protection Peter Dutton and the new Operation  Sovereign Borders Commander Major General Andrew Bottrell today held talks with the Papua  New Guinea (PNG) Minister for Foreign Affairs and Immigration Hon Rimbink Pato MP regarding  the PNG Regional Resettlement Arrangement.

The meeting follows an inspection of the Manus Island Regional Processing Centre (RPC) by Mr  Dutton and MAJGEN Bottrell yesterday.

Mr Dutton said the Australian Government and the Government of PNG have today restated their  commitment to the PNG Regional Resettlement Arrangement.

“I am grateful to the PNG Government for their cooperation in this regional solution, which has so  far seen 11 refugees transferred from the RPC to the East Lorengau Refugee Transit Centre on  Manus Island,” Mr Dutton said.

“My Department has worked closely with the PNG Immigration and Citizenship Service Authority  (PNGICSA) to assist them to establish a robust refugee determination process.”

Refugee determinations are undertaken under PNG domestic law and are administered and  managed by PNGICSA.

While the Government of PNG is responsible for managing the transit centre, Australia continues  to provide support and assistance.

“The PNG Government is continuing its processing of protection claims and I anticipate more  refugees will move to the transit centre in the coming weeks,” Mr Dutton said.
