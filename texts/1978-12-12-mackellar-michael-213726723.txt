.  AUSTRALIAN ASSISTANCE FOR INDO-CHINESE REFUGEES

The Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Hon Andrew Peacock,

and the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, the Hon. M.J.R.

MacKellar, jointly announced in Canberra and Geneva today that

Australia will contribute $A3 million to the United Nations High

-  Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to assist the Indo-Chinese

refugees.

Australian contributed $A2.3 million in 1977/78 for the

same purpose and the new commitment reflects Australia's concern at

the rapidly increasing size of the problem.

This latest contribution was in addition to Australia s

pledge of $A740,000 to the UNHCR General Program of assistance for

refugees throughout the world.

The Ministers said that Australia's contribution would

help UNHCR meet the needs of refugees in camps in countries of

first asylum.

Refugee arrivals in the ASEAN states had increased

considerably in recent weeks and the number of refugees in Malaysian

camps had risen from 16,000 to 45,000 in the past 3 months.

The Ministers also said that Australia would continue to

take a leading role in seeking solutions to the Indo-Chinese refugee

problem. In recent months the Government had taken a number of

significant initiatives to internationalise the resettlement effort,

including the proposal to hold the current Geneva consultations.

The Minister said that Australia also had an on-going

commitment to accept Indo-Chinese refugees. This had been reflected

in yesterday's announcement to increase the 1978/79 Indo-Chinese

refugee intake by 1,500 to bring it to 10,500.
