DEFENCE SURVEILLANCE

Statement by Minister for Defence, .

Mr D.J. Killen

Suggestions that RAN units based in Darwin .

had been placed on "full alert" were simply untrue.

Defence Forces at Darwin are taking appropriate

action to protect Australian interests.

Surveillance of refugee boats is being undertaken

in response to requests by Immigration, Health and

Custom authorities.V Normal defence surveillance of

Australian interests continues.

The refugee problem is a political problem.

It is not a defence problem.
