Humanitarian crisis on Nauru

Medecins Sans Frontiers' revelations about the conditions of the people Australia is detaining on Nauru have laid bare the truly despearte situation, Greens Immigration spokesperson Nick McKim says.

"MSF have made it clear that they have never seen such traumatised people and that every refugee presented with suicidal symptoms," Senator McKim said.

"These are stomach turning revelations which confirm yet again that offshore detention is destroying innocent lives."

"No longer can Morrison and Shorten ignore the humanitarian calamity caused by their bipartisan policy of cruelty."

"Every single person Australia is detaining on Manus Island and Nauru must be evacuated to Australia immediately."
