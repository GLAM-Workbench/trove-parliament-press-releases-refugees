E&OE

Subjects: Newspoll, Nicola Roxon, mining tax, Dalai Lama, PM’s private life, online  shopping, State of Origin.



MADONNA KING: Let's try and start, first with, I guess this poll

out this morning. Dr Emerson, only one in  three voters are now satisfied with the way  Julia Gillard is doing her job?

How do you turn that around?

CRAIG EMERSON: Obviously, the carbon-pricing initiative of

government, the carbon tax, is not popular.

I was reminded by the commentary on this that

neither was the GST when it was first

announced by John Howard.

KING: Yes.

EMERSON: And, for those who say that it's all very dire for

Labor, John Howard announced that GST and

2



went on to ... stayed the Prime Minister for  nine years, so …

KING: All right, but …

EMERSON: …I wouldn't be chuckling or chortling if I were

those who want to see an end to the Labor  Government …

KING: All right, but…

EMERSON: … because there's a long way to go.

KING: Her support is now lower than Kevin Rudd's

rating just before he was dumped. At what  point does the support the Prime Minister has  become an issue for the party?

EMERSON: Well, I think it is very much related to the fact

that we have, on the books, a proposal to  introduce a carbon tax. And the support for the  leader, the support for the party, reflects that  fact, just as it did with the GST. And indeed,  now Julia Gillard as Prime Minister remains  more popular than Tony Abbott as Opposition  Leader.

At a comparable time with the GST, the

Opposition Leader, Kim Beazley, was far more  popular than the Prime Minister, John Howard,  and he went on to remain Prime Minister for  another nine years.

KING: All right. So you're not particularly worried?

You're saying that the carbon tax is the right  thing to do. It may be an unpopular thing to do,  but so was the GST?

3



EMERSON: Well, indeed. And the carbon tax is a tiny

proportion of the impact of the GST.

KING: All right, then.

George Brandis, briefly: you would agree with

that? John Howard at one stage, I think, had  support of 19 per cent, didn't he?

GEORGE BRANDIS: That was in the 1980s, long before he was the  prime minister and proposed a GST.

Of course there's one very, very big difference

between the carbon tax and the GST, and that  is John Howard took the GST to an election.

They ... Gillard and Howard were both

politicians who at one point had said ... had  ruled out this particular tax.

KING: Yes.

BRANDIS: Howard said, in about 1990, after the 1993

election, that a GST was off the agenda. Julia  Gillard …

EMERSON: Well actually, he said Ã¢ÂÂnever, everÃ¢ÂÂ.

BRANDIS: … said six days before the 2010 election:

“there will be no carbon tax under the

government I lead”.

KING: All right. We know, we know that …

BRANDIS: And the ... and the diff… I know you know it.

4



KING: Are you saying …

BRANDIS: You asked, you asked me a question,

Madonna, and I'm simply responding with the  facts.

EMERSON: George is a bit toey this morning.

BRANDIS: With the facts.

KING: But, but, so …

BRANDIS: And the difference is that Howard didn't break

his promise. He said to the people: “I have  reconsidered the matter, but because I made  this commitment years ago, I won't introduce a  GST unless you give me your mandate to do  so at an election”.

KING: All right, now. I'm jumping in here. I'm jumping

in here. I mean, you're simply saying that John  Howard took his unpopular promise to an  election. Julia Gillard didn't.

BRANDIS: Well it's not as easy …

EMERSON: And John Howard actually said there would

never, ever be a GST.

BRANDIS: Excuse me Craig. Excuse me. Excuse me

Craig.

Can I have a go, please?

EMERSON: I thought you just did, George.

5



BRANDIS: Can I have a go?

EMERSON: You just did. There was someone here talking.

I thought it was you.

BRANDIS: Can I have a go, please Craig, and can I have

a roughly equivalent time?

KING: Well I think you have.

EMERSON: Oh, gee…

KING: I think you have.

EMERSON: … this is a bad morning for the Liberals.

BRANDIS: Yeah, terrible morning. I was …

EMERSON: Yeah. Yeah.

BRANDIS: I was reading in this morning's paper …

EMERSON: Very toey.

BRANDIS: …Craig.

EMERSON: Very toey.

KING: All right. I think we've finished that issue and

we're going to actually go onto another issue.  And this is on Nicola Roxon, who on AM, the  Federal Opposition has branded her a  hypocrite for seeking financial support from  tobacco manufacturer Phillip Morris in 2005,  almost a year after her then-leader - that was

6



Mark Latham - had banned tobacco industry  donations to the Labor Party.

George Brandis, how serious a problem is

this? Should it cost her her job?

BRANDIS: Well, the tradition is that if a minister lies to the

Parliament, they should resign.

Now, this morning, within the last half-hour,

the Labor Party actually used its numbers to  close down a debate on this in the House of  Representatives.

The fact is that Nicola Roxon has been going

around the country for a long time now  scolding the Liberal Party for taking money  from tobacco companies. And now we find that  she, herself, was soliciting money for the  Labor Party from tobacco companies.

KING: All right, so …

BRANDIS: It couldn't be a ... there couldn't be a clearer

case of hypocrisy and dishonesty …

KING: All right, but…

BRANDIS: … by a minister.

KING: But my question to you was, should she lose

her job over it?

Yes or no.

BRANDIS: Well, traditionally…

7



KING: I'm asking you. Forget tradition.

George Brandis, do you think that she should

lose her job over this?

BRANDIS: Well I haven't seen what Mr Dutton, the health

spokesman, has said in the House of  Representatives in the last half an hour, but  I'm merely pointing out …

KING: Yes.

BRANDIS: …that traditionally a minister who is exposed

for…

KING: Yes, you've explained that.

BRANDIS: …lying to Parliament ought to resign.

EMERSON: Yes, well let me…

KING: All right. Craig, no, no Craig Emerson - let me

ask you a specific question. I mean, this is the  Health Minister of Australia. She's admitted  very strongly this morning it was a mistake, but  she did it. Should she remain the Health  Minister?

EMERSON: Yes, she should and I resent strongly

George's assertion that Nicola Roxon lied to  the Parliament. She did not. She did not. And  so …

BRANDIS: She said the Labor Party doesn't take money

from tobacco companies.

8



EMERSON: …as a barrister or a QC equivalent, to say that

she lied to the Parliament, knowing that she  didn't, is highly irresponsible and reckless.

BRANDIS: Well, sorry…

EMERSON: She did not lie to the Parliament. Now George,

you just asked for me to give you a go after  you had a good run at it; let me now respond  to this. Nicola is embarrassed about this. I will  point out to your listeners that no such  donations were ever made ... were ever made,  in contrast to the Coalition which freely  accepts donations from the big tobacco  companies.

KING: Yeah, but I'm asking about Nicola Roxon.

EMERSON: But she is embarrassed - yes, and I said she is

embarrassed about it and she has indicated  that she's embarrassed.

KING: All right. Can I move on slightly on this issue,

but watching her on television this morning,  she was very, very open. Whether you like  Labor, dislike Labor, she said Ã¢ÂÂyes, it was a  mistakeÃ¢ÂÂ. She was questioned: Ã¢ÂÂwell, did you  not really know they were on the invitation?Ã¢ÂÂ.  She was very clear. She said: Ã¢ÂÂno, no I knew it  was a mistakeÃ¢ÂÂ. And I'm just wondering, as a  politician, is it refreshing to hear, or do we  need more of you to come out when

something is done - whether or not it costs  your job - and say, Ã¢ÂÂlook, I made a mistake. I  got it wrongÃ¢ÂÂ, and cop the consequences of  that? Do we need to see a bit more of that?

EMERSON: Well, I think so. And I think the Australian

public is very understanding, because most

9



members of the Australian public, at some  time or other in their lives, also make

mistakes. It actually has them, in a sense,  understanding that people aren't perfect.  Nicola wasn't perfect in this case and I think  people do think a little bit of candour and  directness is the right way to go on it.

KING: George Brandis, do you give her a pat on the

back for openly admitting it and doing it in that  way? Or do you think …

BRANDIS: No, because ... no, I give her no pat on the

back, because she's lying about it. This wasn't  a mistake. This was an act of hypocrisy which  she is now trying to air-brush away by saying,  in effect, Ã¢ÂÂoh, look, we'll all human, I just made  a mistakeÃ¢ÂÂ. She did one thing quite deliberately  and she said the opposite and she lied to the  Parliament about it.

EMERSON: She did not lie to the Parliament about it.

KING: All right. Let George Brandis have his say,

Craig Emerson.

So George Brandis, how does ... where does

this go from here? The debate is being closed  down. Is it over?

BRANDIS: Well, the debate was closed down by the

Labor Party, so that Parliament could consider  the matter half an hour ago. I wouldn't be  surprised that it ... well, I'm sure that the issue  will continue today. Because, I mean, there's a  pattern of conduct here. You've got a Prime  Minister who lies to the public about a carbon  tax. You've got a Health Minister who lies to  the public about tobacco advertising. I mean

10



that ... you wonder why the government is  plummeting in the polls, because nobody can  believe a word their ministers say.

KING: All right. Now I want to move on to mining tax

next and Craig Emerson, if I give this to you -  there's asylum-seekers, there's the carbon tax  that we've talked about. There's the mining  tax. All huge policies; but the mining tax,  where exactly is it? Where is it at?

EMERSON: Well it's now in detailed legislative form and

we are obviously pressing ahead with the  mining tax. We said that we would and the  benefits of the mining tax include tax breaks  for small business and increasing people's  superannuation entitlements from 9 per cent to  12 per cent.

KING: All right. And at what level is the tax, or how is

that determined?

EMERSON: I think the effective rate is 22 per cent, but this

has all been both announced, and then  through a committee convened by leading  businessman Don Argus.

KING: Look, I understand that, but Andrew Forrest

from Fortescue Metals, very upset. He was in  Canberra again yesterday. Does he have a  point that this might be okay for big miners, big  companies, but it will hurt many of the smaller  ones?

EMERSON: Well, I'm not sure ... I mean I know Andrew

well and I don't think he would actually say  that he's a little miner. He's a big miner, too,  and the fact is iron ore prices - mineral prices -  are the highest in 140 years. And the general

11



public deserves a share of those extra profits  and that share will be delivered in the form of  extra infrastructure, tax breaks for small  business, a small cut in the company tax rate  and, importantly, increased superannuation  savings for working Australians.

KING: Do you think - just before I go to George

Brandis - do you think if this was put to the  public, most people would say, Ã¢ÂÂlook, they're  big mining companies, they earn a lot of  money and, yes, this is a good taxÃ¢ÂÂ? It would  [indistinct]…

EMERSON: Look, I think that is right. And it was put to the

public. It was put to the public before the last  election because we said we would proceed  with the mining tax. Tony Abbott said he would  rescind the mining tax …

KING: Yes.

EMERSON: …and give the money back to the miners and

deprive small businesses and working  Australians of the superannuation and the tax  breaks.

KING: George Brandis?

BRANDIS: Well, our position has not changed on this. We

think the mining tax is a thoroughly bad idea. It  will have a devastating effect on mining  communities and though - particularly, of  course, in Western Australia and Queensland -  ..

And it's all very well for Craig to say, Ã¢ÂÂwell, you

knowÃ¢ÂÂ - I mean, I don't want to put words in  your mouth, Craig, but in effect, what Craig is

12



saying, well, the Government has done a  sweetheart deal with the three big

multinationals - BHP Billiton, Xstrata and Rio.  But what about the rest of the mining sector,  including Mr Forrest's Fortescue Metals?

KING: Yes.

BRANDIS: But there are literally thousands of small

miners. There are hundreds of quite

substantial what are called mid-cap miners.

KING: Yes.

BRANDIS: And they employ tens of thousands of people.

There is no provision for them because the  Government, in a corporatist way, has done a  deal with the three biggest …

KING: Or - no

BRANDIS: Correct.

EMERSON: Completely incorrect. This is a profits-based

tax. The Western Australian Government just  increased royalties, which the same Mr Forrest  says is fine, which is not based on profits. If  they're little miners and aren't profitable or not  very profitable …

KING: Yes.

EMERSON: … they won't pay the tax.

KING: All right. Will it be impossible to roll back,

though, George Brandis? Will it be too hard to  do that?

13



BRANDIS: Well, that's the commitment we've made.

KING: All right. Let's go on to Sixty Minutes. Did

either of you see that episode with Julia Gillard  and Tim Mathieson?

BRANDIS: Yeah, I watched it.

EMERSON: And I didn't.

BRANDIS: I watched it.

KING: All right. Annabel Crabb on The Drum website

yesterday wondered why people felt they  could take such liberties with the Prime  Minister. Tim Mathieson was asked whether  he was in love with this woman. He said, Ã¢ÂÂyes,  absolutelyÃ¢ÂÂ. The Prime Minister was then  asked did she love this man. She said,  Ã¢ÂÂabsolutelyÃ¢ÂÂ. And Annabel Crabb said, Ã¢ÂÂis it  because she's a woman that those questions  can be askedÃ¢ÂÂ or, secondly, because she's  somehow failed to assume the respect of the  Prime Minister's office. Craig Emerson, what  do you think?

EMERSON: I think people are entitled to ask questions in a

democracy. It doesn't seem to me to be ...  strike me as a particularly affronting sort of  question, as to whether two people are in love.  I mean …

KING: Yeah. So you say in public office, no real

question is ...  a question like that is not off-bounds?

EMERSON: No, I don't think so.

14



KING: Yeah. What about you, George Brandis?

Would you agree with that?

BRANDIS: Look, I ... not necessarily. I've got a rather

more conservative view of these things. But,  you know, understandably, people are  interested in the personal stories of political  leaders. I think that's fair enough. I don't think  it's a gendered thing, though. And to the extent  to which people lack respect for Julia Gillard, I  don't think it's got anything to do with her  personal life. It's got to do with the fact that  she can't run a government competently, and  that she lied to them.

KING: All right. From …

EMERSON: Old George never misses a beat, does he?

BRANDIS: Well, that's the reason…

KING: Well, all right.

BRANDIS: That's my opinion, frankly. That's my opinion.

EMERSON: Here he goes again.

BRANDIS: I think people …

EMERSON: There goes that poofle valve.

BRANDIS: …don't respect Julia Gillard because she lied

to them.

KING: All right. Let's go from Julia Gillard to Bob

Katter. Do you think his party is making any  inroads, yes or no?

15



EMERSON: Early days, I think. It's obviously a party of the

conservative side of politics.

KING: All right.

EMERSON: I really just think it's too early to say, Madonna.

KING: And George Brandis?

BRANDIS: I suspect, like a lot of these parties built

around, you know, one prominent personality,  it will attract a bit of attention for a while. But I  agree with Craig about this: I don't think it will  go very far.

KING: Either of you want to meet the ...

EMERSON: I didn't say that [laughs].

KING: [Laughs]

BRANDIS: I thought that's where you were heading.

KING: [indistinct]…he was close enough.

EMERSON: He wanted to get around in front of me and

lead me there.

KING: Do either of you want to meet the Dalai Lama?

EMERSON: Well, to be perfectly honest, I'm just flat chat.

We've actually got a Filipino trade delegation  today and tomorrow.

KING: All right. That's - okay. So you're saying you

would, if the opportunity arose, or am I putting

16



words in your mouth? It's not something you're  desperate to do?

EMERSON: Not desperate to do.

KING: All right. George Brandis?

BRANDIS: Look, I'm a bit like Craig here. I was invited to

a function for the Dalai Lama yesterday. And it  was in my diary, but I just got too busy to go.

KING: And you just didn't turn up?

BRANDIS: Well, I just wasn't able to.

EMERSON: Snubbed.

BRANDIS: So I sent an apology.

EMERSON: Fair enough.

KING: He might have thought you were a woman.

Did you see where he thought Julia Gillard  was a man till he was told? And just ... with  such good humour.

BRANDIS: No comment.

KING: No?

BRANDIS: No comment.

EMERSON: Gorgeous George is not a woman.

KING: To this issue, very briefly. The Productivity

Commission is looking at the retail sector and

17



this online shopping issue. Colorado Group  are closing 142 stores; 1,042 people to lose  their jobs. Retailers are saying it should  consider dropping the $1,000 GST-free  threshold on buying goods online. CHOICE  says that's not the answer. Many mark-ups are  much higher than that. Do either of you do  your shopping online, any shopping, for  clothes or shoes?

EMERSON: No, I don't, but my kids all do.

KING: Yeah? And what about you, George Brandis?

EMERSON: And I think that's ...  I think that is a trend.

KING: Yeah.

EMERSON: Kids just automatically think of online and they

will compare a store price with an online price.  And a lot of the online goods turn up within a  week and that's pretty appealing to the kids.  So, a challenge for retailers. I think people do  want to touch and feel and …

KING: All right.

EMERSON: …look at items, but that's going to require a bit

of change on the part of our traditional  retailers.

KING: George Brandis, do you ever shop, your kids

shop, online?

BRANDIS: My kids do. And I occasionally buy books

online.

18



KING: So do you think there is an argument for that

$1,000 GST-free threshold to change, to be  reduced?

BRANDIS: Well, I'm not here on your radio show to

announce tax policy on behalf of the Coalition,  am I?

KING: No, but ... so the Coalition doesn't have a view

on this? Is that what you're saying?

BRANDIS: No, no. I'm saying I'm not here to announce

tax policy on your radio show.

KING: No, well ... well, what is the Coalition's current

policy on this?

BRANDIS: The Coalition's current policy is we don't

favour increases in the tax rate.

KING: Okay.

EMERSON: That doesn't answer the question. No one is

proposing increasing the GST rate.

BRANDIS: Or increasing the tax burden by shifting

thresholds or whatever.

KING: Yes. Okay. And, Craig Emerson, what's your

view?

EMERSON: Happy to see the Productivity Commission

complete its report on this matter. And it is  looking at this very issue, Madonna.

19



KING: Okay. Finally, State of Origin. Let's end on a

note where you'll both agree. Who's going to  win?

EMERSON: I actually think it will be very close. It's in

Sydney. And New South Wales are now more  competitive. There's no doubt about that, just  based on the first State of Origin match. So,  tipping Queensland because they seem to pull  something out of the ...  a little rabbit out of the  hat in the last couple of minutes, just when  New South Wales think they're across the line.  So tipping Queensland, but fasten your  seatbelts because it's going to be a real close  one.

KING: And, George, you'd agree with that?

BRANDIS: Yes, I think Craig is a pretty good football

commentator, I might say, so I'm prepared to  adopt his predictions.

KING: Would you say a better football commentator

than politician?

BRANDIS: No, I didn't say that.

KING: [Laughs] They're ending on a friendly note.

George Brandis, thank you.

BRANDIS: Thank you.

KING: Craig Emerson, thank you.

EMERSON: Bye-bye, Madonna.

20



KING: And we'll catch up with Senator George

Brandis and Dr Craig Emerson at the same  time next week.
