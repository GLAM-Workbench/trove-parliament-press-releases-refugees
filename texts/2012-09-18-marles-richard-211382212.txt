Australia Awards Presentation Ceremony  Parliament House

Speech, E&OE, check against delivery

18 September 2012

It is my great pleasure to be with you here in Parliament House.

Can I congratulate those of you who are receiving an Australia Award and extend a very  warm welcome to you all.

There are nearly 200 of you here, from 46 countries.

That's an impressive international gathering.

Your time in Australia will establish enduring ties between our country and yours as well as  between all of you.

It's a journey of friendship and connection that may be lifelong.

It will certainly be enriching.

I was recently in Ethiopia and met award recipients about to undertake their studies in  Australia.

I also had a chance to speak with Australia Awards alumni who were there to share their  experiences of life and study in Australia.

What struck me about this impressive group was the sense of potential they had about the  contribution they can make to the development of their countries.

They approached their careers with enormous enthusiasm and commitment.

The Australian Government invests in Australia Awards and the Leadership for Development  Program to build capacity so you all can lead development reform in your home countries.

Leadership and the Leadership for Development Program

In 2012, around 4500 scholarships will be offered to people from 108 developing countries.

By 2014 the number of awardees in Australia at any one time will increase to over 6000.

You are here because you have been identified as having strong leadership qualities.

The Australian Government is not only investing in your formal education, but also in  providing you with opportunities to establish and strengthen your networks, including with  Australia.

Australia recognises that leadership is of central importance to development, and that  development driven from within is much more likely to be sustainable and relevant to the  country context.

The size and complexity of the development challenges faced by countries today increasingly  require collaborative leadership.

That is why we need to continue to build networks and partnerships for development - to  achieve objectives that would otherwise not be possible to achieve, and to overcome  challenges that we cannot overcome alone.

Leaders are not just the national political leaders of a country, but people and organisations  across all levels and sectors - public and private sectors, civil society and non-government  organisations.

It is our hope that through your formal academic studies and your networking at this  conference, and as part of the Program's other activities, you will become a source of new  ideas and new approaches to tackling age-old problems.

I understand that you have the opportunity this week at the Leadership for Development  conference to discuss key themes in development, such as governance, accountability,  diplomacy, cultural identity and mining.

Australia recognises that education has a central function in development. It provides the  foundations for economic growth, strengthens education and improves stability and security,  and fosters effective states.

We know, too, that a key indicator of economic advancement is the full inclusion of women  in the life of a nation.

Australia's aid program, and the Leadership for Development Program as a part of this, aims  to empower women to participate in the economy, leadership and education because of the  critical untapped role of women in development.

That is why the Prime Minister announced recently at the Pacific Islands Forum that  Australia will support gender equality in the region through a partnership of more than $300  million over the next decade.

Australia Awards Global Alumni

As with the empowerment of women, the development challenges we are facing are not  short-term challenges, but will be the work of generations.

Many of you will soon be going home to join the ranks of thousands of Australia Awards  alumni who will shape reform and development and contribute to a positive future for the  generations to follow.

We know these opportunities are possible because of those who have been before you.

Indeed, the current Vice President of Indonesia, Dr Boediono is an AusAID alumnus.

But you don't need to become a politician to make a difference in your country.

An AusAID graduate from Samoa has made a significant impact to the Education Sector in  Samoa, and is now giving advice to AusAID on its education programs.

Tilianamua Afamasaga, who studied at Macquarie University under an AusAID scholarship,  developed Samoan Teacher Training institutions, was the Dean of Education at the  University of Samoa and established and now runs the Centre for Professional Development  at the University.

Tilianamua has also worked as a consultant for AusAID in areas such as Inclusive Education  and designed a Samoa School Fee Relief Scheme.

Allison Sudradjat Awardees

Education is the flagship of the Australian aid program.

We have many people in our government and aid program who are advocates for education;  and one of our strongest was the late Allison Sudradjat.

Allison was the head of AusAID in Indonesia when she and 21 others died in a plane crash at  Jogjakarta in 2007.

She knew without a shadow of doubt the power that education had to lift people out of  poverty and allow them to grow as individuals.

To honour her life, AusAID established leadership awards in her name for promising leaders  in Indonesia and Papua New Guinea. These were countries Allison worked in and were very  dear to her.

Five recipients of the Allison Sudradjat Award are here tonight.

It gives me great pleasure to congratulate these awardees tonight and invite them up to the  podium.

1. Mrs Atun WARDATUN

Atun commenced a PhD at the University of Western Sydney this year. She is specialising in  gender relations in the West Nusa Tengarra province of Indonesia. Before coming to  Australia, Atun was a lecturer at the State Institute for Islamic Studies Mataram and has  worked as a gender analyst at the Indonesia Women Association for Justice and as a trainer  on gender issues. She aims to use her knowledge to continue advocating for the  mainstreaming of gender perspectives into government policies in Indonesia.

2. Mrs Sri Wiyanti EDDYONO

Also from Indonesia, Sri Wiyanti was previously a research associate at the Semarak Cerlang  Nusa Consultancy, Research and Education for Social Transformation. She has had a long  history of dedicated activism for women's rights. She is currently undertaking a PhD at  Monash University to continue her work on women's empowerment, governance and human  rights issues.

3. Ms Mary MAGABE

Before coming to Australia, Mary was a midwife and Nurse Unit manager at Mendi Hospital  in the Southern Highlands Province of Papua New Guinea. She is undertaking a Masters in  Midwifery at Flinders University, including a reasearch project on “Assessing the use,  knowledge, and accessibility of family planning by child bearing age women in Southern  Highlands of Papua New Guinea. Currently Papua New Guinea has one of the highest  maternal and infant mortality and morbidity rates in the Asia Pacific region, and Mary aims  to apply her skills and knowledge to improve the evidence base for improved practices in  midwifery, to address women's and children's health in her province, and throughout Papua  New Guinea.

4. Mr Harits MASDUQI

Harits commenced a PhD in Education at the University of Sydney last year, so is the veteran  of the group. Before undertaking his PhD he was a lecturer at the State University of Malang  in East Java, Indonesia. His research is focused on Asia-Pacific students and their use of  critical thinking skills and reading skills in English. He wants to apply his knowledge in  developing critical thinking and leadership training both locally, in East Java, and across  Indonesia.

5. Mr Andrey DAMALEDO

Before being awarded with an Australia Leadership Award, Mr Damaledo was the Head of  the Integrated Secretariat for International Development Cooperation in the Regional  Development Planning Agency in the Indonesian province of East Nusa Tenggara. Mr  Damaledo is undertaking a PhD at the Australian National University on East Timorese  Refugees Communities in the Local Development of West Timor.

I would also like to acknowledge Mr Arthur Elijah from Papua New Guinea, an Allison  Sudradjat Awardee for 2012 that is not able to join us in Canberra tonight. Mr Elijah is  currently undertaking a Master of Public Health at Monash University in order to acquire the  necessary skills to become a lecturer in obstetrics and gynaecology at the University of Papua  New Guinea.

I am sure that were Allison still here she would wholeheartedly approve of your work and the  contribution you have made - and will continue to make - to your countries' development.

Once again, I would like to say how privileged I am to be hosting this reception tonight to  welcome you to Australia and to Canberra, and to our fine higher education institutions.

Make the most of your time here in Australia - both professionally and personally - and  please stay connected with us.

Thank you.
