CHANGING REALITIES IN THE ASIA/PACIFIC REGION

The following is the text of the address by  the Minister for Foreign Affairs,  Mr Andrew Peacock, to  the Council of World Affairs in Los Angeles on 5 October  1979.

I T  IS NOW.-SOME F IV E YEARS SINCE AN AUSTRALIAN FOREIGN MINISTER '  HAS HAD THE HONOUR TO ADDRESS THE LOS ANGELES COUNCIL OF WORLD A F F A Â­ I R S .  THE INTERNATIONAL SCENE THAT MY PREDECESSOR WOULD HAVE DEPICTED  TO YOU THEN HAS- CHANGED SI G N I F IC A N T L Y .  TRENDS THAT WERE EMERGING I-N

THE EARLY SEVENTIES HAVE GATHERED MOMENTUM. THE COMPETITIVE PACE QFi  INTERNATIONAL POLITICS HAS QUICKENED IN AN ENVIRONMENT THAT I S  UNSETÂ­ TLED, EVEN VOLATILE. .

I CANNOT HOPE TO DO FULL JUSTICE TO THE MANY UNDERCURRENTS IN  THIS EVOLVING WORLD SCENE. INSTEAD, I PROPOSE TO CONCENTRATE UPON "   THE CHANGING REAL IT IE S IN ASIA AND THE PA C IF IC  -  PARTICULARLY THEIR  ECONOMIC DIMENSION: I DO SO DELIBERATE!Y AND WITH GOOD REASON. OF ALL THE DEVELOPMENTS OF THE SEVENTIES ONE OF THE MOST FAR-REACHING  HAS BEEN THE ECONOMIC TRANSFORMATION OF THIS REGION. CHANGE IS  OCCURRING RAPIDLY AND ON A LARGE SCALE.

THE SINGULAR STORY OF JAPAN'S ECONOMIC SUCCESS IS FAMILIAR TO  YOU. WHA1 IS LESS OFTEN REALISED IS THAT JAPAN'S SUCCESS HAS BOOSTED  ECONOMIC GROWTH IN OTHER REGIONAL COUNTRIES. JAPAN CONTINUES TO  STIMULATE GROWTH -  AS A SOURCE OF CAPITAL, TECHNOLOGY AND AS THE

PROVIDER OF SUBSTANTIA! MARKETS -  BLIT MORE IMPORTANTLY, I T  HAS BECOME  THE MODEL FOR REGIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT.

JUST AS EXPORTS OF MANUFACTURES WERE VITAL TO JAPAN'S SUCCESS, SO  THE PRODUCTION AND EXPORT OF LABOUR-INTENSIVE MANUFACTURES HAS  GENERATED REMARKABLE TRADE AND INDUSTRIAL GROWTH IN OTHER COUNTRIES  IN THE REGION. THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA, TAIWAN, HONG KONG AND MEMBERS  OF THE ASSOCIATION OF SOUTH EAST ASIAN NATIONS (ASEAN) -  COLLECTIVELY  REFERRED TO AS THE NEWLY INDUSTRIALISING COUNTRIES -  HAVE ALL PARTICÂ­

IPATED IN THIS PROCESS.

GROWTH RATES IN THE REGION HAVE BEEN CONSISTENTLY HIGH SINCE  THE EARLY S I X T I E S  -  RANGING FROM SEVEN TO TWELVE PERCENT A YEAR. THE  REPUBLIC OF KOREA, FOR EXAMPLE,.HAS NOW ALMOST REACHED THE LEVEL OF  DEVELOPMENT AND INCOME ATTAINED BY JAPAN IN THE EARLY S I X T I E S . OTHERS ARE NOT FAR BEHIND. Ã¢ÂÂ '. *

T H I S  SUCCESS HAS AL READY HAD AN I M P A C T  COMPARABLE TO T H E  C H A L L Â­

WE IN AUSTRALIA HAVE BEEN PARTICULARLY ALIVE TO THESE CHANGES. IT  I S ,  AFTER ALL, THE REGION IN WHICH WE L I V E  AND WHICH SHAPES AND  COLOURS OUR EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT. NATURALLY, AUSTRALIA HAS NOT BEEN  IMMUNE TO THE ECONOMIC PROBLEMS "! HAT HAVE BUFFETED THE DEVELOPED

2

WORLD OVf.P THL PAST DECADE. BUT INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT IN THE A S I A /   PACIFIC REGION- HAS GIVEN A PARTICULAR REGIONAL FOCUS TO THE EXTERNAL   PRESSURES ON THE AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY. I T  HAS BROUGHT HOME TO THE   AUSTRALIAN COMMUNITY THE REALITY OF OUR ECONOMIC POSITION AND THE

COMPETITIVE CHALLENGES HE FACE : THE RELATIVELY EVEN GROWTH OF THE   S IX T IE S  IS BEHIND US.

Â· BUT k'E MUST OFFSET THE COMPETITIVE CHALLENGES AGAINST THE EXPANÂ­ DING OPPORTUNITIES BEING GENERATED BY ECONOMIC GROWTH IN THE REGION.   ALREADY THE REGIONAL ECONOMY HAS BECOME AN IMPORTANT MARKET FOR RAW '   MATERIALS, ENERGY RESOURCES, A BROAD RANGE OF INDUSTRIAL GOODS AND

EQUIPMENT AND FOODSTUFFS- Ã¢ÂÂ

AUSTRALIA, FOR REASONS OF GEOGRAPHICAL PROXIMITY AND COMPLEMENTÂ­ ARITY OF TRADE INTEREST, IS WELL PLACED TO REAP RICH REWARDS. INDEED   GOVERNMENT AND ACADEMIC AUTHORITIES HAVE EXPRESSED THE VIEW THAT, IN   THE LONG TERM, THE REGION OFFERS A SET OF PROSPECTS DISTINCTLY ORIENÂ­

TED TOWARDS AUSTRALIA'S RESOURCE AND TECHNOLOGY BASE. DEMAND FOR   MINERALS, ENERGY RESOURCES AND FOODSTUFFS IS EXPECTED TO RISE   STEADILY BUT THE PROSPECTS FOR THE AUSTRALIAN MANUFACTURING AND   SERVICE SECTORS ARE ALSO PROMISING.

SO FAR I HAVE ADVANCED ECONOMIC ARGUMENTS IN FAVOUR OF GREATER   PARTICIPATION BY THE DEVELOPED COUNTRIES IN THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION   IN THE REGION. THERE ARE ALSO COMPELLING POLITICAL REASONS FOR   DOING SO. LET ME REFER AGAIN TO AUSTRALIA'S EXPERIENCE. IN OUR   CASE IT IB BECOMING INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT TO SEPARATE OUR DOMESTIC   ECONOMIC D IFFIC U LTIE S  FROM OUR FOREIGN RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE

COUNTRIES OF THE REGION. AS I HAVE FREQUENTLY STATED IN AUSTRALIA   OUR FUTURE POLITICAL RELATIONS WITH THE REGION AND OUR DOMESTIC   ECONOMIC FUTURE ARE TWO SIDES OF THE SAME COIN.

BUT THIS POINT HAS A MORE GENERAL APPLICATION. IN THE LONGER   TERM ECONOMIC CHANGE WILL HAVE A PROFOUND INFLUENCE IN SHAPING RELATÂ­ IONSHIPS WITHIN THE REGION AND BETWEEN THE REGION AND THE REST OF   THE WORLD. ALREADY THERE ARE SIGNS THAT THE FAMILIAR REGIONAL LANDÂ­ SCAPE IS CHANGING -  NEW PATTERNS ARE. EMERGING. RAPID ECONOMIC GROWTH

IS OCCURRING AGAINST THE BACKGROUND OF IMPORTANT CHANGES ON THE   GROUND IN THE REGION. WHAT SIGNIFICANCE THESE DEVELOPMENTS WILL   ULTIMATELY HAVE WILL DEPEND ON HOW THEY F I T  INTO A PICTURE WHICH IS   FAR FROM COMPLETE . .

IN THE TIME AVAILABLE I CAN ONLY HEADLINE SOME OF THE MORE   IMPORTANT ELEMENTS IN THE SHIFTING PATTERN OF RELATIONSHIPS IN THE   REGION. THESE MUST INCLUDE j -  '

.. THE WAR IN 1NDO-CHINA AND, OF COURSE, FLOWING FROM THIS SITUATION THE MORE IMMEDIATE AND PRESSING HUMANITARIAN PROBLEMS OF THE   REFUGEE EXODUS FROM INDO-CHINA AND THE RELIEF OF THE DEVASTATED   .POPULATION OF KAMPUCHEA: '

- CHINA'S MODERNISATION PROGRAM AND THE IMPROVED TENOR OF ITS RELATÂ­ IONS WITH NON-COMMUNIST COUNTRIES:

- THE INCREASING SELF-CONFIDENCE, RESILIENCE AND COHESION OF ASEAN   WHICH HAS EMERGED AS AN IMPORTANT REGIONAL GROUP: AND

-  THE P O S S IB IL IT Y  OF A MORE ACTIVE POLITICAL ROLE IN THE REGION FOR JAPAN. .

I COULD ADD TO THE LIS T  BUT TO DO SO WOULD ONLY ILLUSTRATE MORE ,   FORCEFULLY THE EXTENT TO WHICH REGIONAL RELATIONSHIPS ARE SHOT   THROUGH WITH UNCERTAINTIES. TWO ASPECTS DESERVE MORE ATTENTION,   HOWEVER: THE SITUATION IN INDO-CHINA AND THE QUESTION OF JAPAN'S FUTURE ROLE IN THE REGION.

THE SITUATION IN INDO-CHINA HAS CREATED PROFOUND UNEASE THROUGHÂ­ OUT SOUTH-EAST ASIA. THE VIETNAMESE INVASION OF KAMPUCHEA AND THE   LARGE-SCALE EXODUS OF REFUGEES FROM BOTH KAMPUCHEA AND VIETNAM HAVE   CREATED SERIOUS POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC PROBLEMS AND TENSIONS WHICH   THREATEN.TO JEOPARDISE REGIONAL ST A B IL IT Y .

THE HUMANITARIAN ASPECTS OF THE INDO-CHINA SITUATION ARE OBVIOUS   AND COMPELLING. WE FACE A C R IS IS ’ OF MASSIVE PROPORTIONS. IN THE   NAME OF HUMANITY IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY   CO-OPERATE FULLY AND URGENTLY IN BRINGING RELIEF TO THE STARVING AND

DEVASTATED PEOPLE OF KAMPUCHEA. FOR ITS PART AUSTRALIA IS DOING ALL   THAT IT CAN TO ASSIST IN SAVING THE KHMER PEOPLE. IN RELATION TO   THE WIDER REFUGEE PROBLEM WE ARE SETTLING SUBSTANTIAL NUMBERS OF   REFUGEES IN AUSTRALIA. WE CONTINUE TO PROVIDE SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS   OF FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE.

LESS OBVIOUS BUT NO LESS COMPELLING ARE THE SECURITY IMPLICATIONS   FOR THE REGION. THE BASIC CAUSES OF THE HUMANITARIAN CRISIS IN   INDO-CHINA HAVE NOT BEEN RESOLVED. IT STEMS FROM THE RIVALRY AND   HOSTILITY WHICH EXISTS AMONG THE FOUR COMMUNIST STATES -  THE SOVIET   UNION, CHINA, VIETNAM AND KAMPUCHEA. THE SEEDS FOR AN ESCALATION OF   GREAT POWER RIVALRY IN THE REGION REMAIN -  AND WILL REMAIN UNTIL THE   NATURE OF VIETNAM'S RELATIONSHIPS WITH ITS COMMUNIST AND NON-COMMUNÂ­

IST NEIGHBOURS IS RESOLVED. THERE CAN BE NO LASTING PEACE IN THE   REGION UNTIL ALL EXTERNAL FORCES ARE WITHDRAWN FROM KAMPUCHEA AND   THE KHMER PEOPLE ARE PERMITTED TO. DECIDE THEIR OWN FUTURE FREE OF   OUTSIDE INTERFERENCE OF ANY KIND.

THE SECOND QUESTION I WANT TO RAISE IS JAPAN'S FUTURE ROLE IN   THE REGION -  NOT ONLY BECAUSE OF JAPAN'S CENTRAL IMPORTANCE BUT ALSO   BECAUSE THE QUESTION BRINGS ME BACK TO MY MAJOR THEME OF ECONOMIC   GROWTH IN THE REGION,

IF IN THE PAST JAPAN FELT THAT ITS ECONOMIC SUCCESS HAD NOT BEEN   SUFFICIENTLY RECOGNISED OR ADEQUATELY REWARDED WITH THE INTERNATIONAL   STATUS IT BELIEVED WAS ITS DUE, JAPAN HAS NOW ACQUIRED GREATER   CONFIDENCE. ITS INFLUENCE HAS GROWN. THIS HAS BEEN EVIDENT IN THE

EXPANSION OF JAPAN'S RELATIONSHIP WITH CHINA AND IN ITS DEVELOPING   RELATIONS WITH ASEAN. JAPAN HAS ALSO DISPLAYED GREATER INDEPENDENCE   IN ITS DEALINGS WITH VIETNAM. '

IT WOULD BE RASH THESE DAYS TO ASSERT THAT ECONOMICS DETERMINES   POLITICS BUT THE SPECULATION THAT SURROUNDS JAPAN'S FUTURE ROLE   EXEMPLIFIES THE AMBIGUITIES AND UNCERTAINTIES INHERENT IN THE GROWÂ­ ING ECONOMIC STRENGTH OF THE REGION. BUT IT IS CERTAIN THAT JUST AS

JAPAN HAS PROVIDED THE -STIMULUS AND MODEL FOR REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT   SO THE COURSE IT ADOPTS WILL HAVE A VITAL BEARING ON THE FUTURE   PATTERN OF RELATIONSHIPS THROUGHOUT THE REGION. .

THE NEWLY INDUSTRIALISING COUNTRIES OF THE REGION HAVE DEMONSTRATÂ­ ED THEIR DESIRE TO REMAIN WITHIN THE WESTERN SYSTEM OF TRADE AND   PAYMENTS. IN FACT, A RELATIVELY FREE AND OPEN INTERNATIONAL TRADING   SYSTEM HAS BEEN A VITAL ELEMENT IN THE ROBUST GROWTH ACHIEVED BY   THEM SO FAR. BUT TO REMAIN WITHIN THIS SYSTEM THEY WILL NEED TO   DEMONSTRATE TO THETIR PEOPLES THE CONTINUING BENEFITS OF THIS ASSOCIAÂ­ TION. IT IS IN THIS CONTEXT THAT THE INCREASED T R E N D  TOWARDS P R O T E C -

TIONISM IN THE ADVANCED ECONOMIES IS SO OMINOUS A .DEVELOPMENT.

IF WE WANT TO PLAY OUR PART IN THE EMERGENCE OF A STABLE AND   PROSPEROUS REGION IT IS IN OUR INTEREST TO FOSTER RATHER THAN PUT   UP BARRIERS TO ECONOMIC GROWTH. WE MUST CHOOSE FOR IT WILL BECOME   INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT TO RECONCILE THE TWO. BOLD AND IMAGINATIVE   NEW METHODS OF CO-OPERATION ARE NECESSARY - METHODS WHICH TAKE   ACCOUNT OF THE PROFOUND ECONOMIC CHANGES WHICH ARE TRANSORMING THE   REGION.

I BELIEVE THIS AWARENESS LIES BEHIND THE JAPANESE PRIME MINISTERS   RECENT REVIVAL OF THE NOTION OF A PACIFIC COMMUNITY. THE CONCEPT   RAISES A RANGE OF FORMIDABLE PROBLEMS WHICH WILL NEED TO BE ADDRESSED   FRANKLY AND OPENLY IF THE IDEA I*S TO MAKE ANY PROGRESS. GIVEN THE   VERY GENERAL NATURE OF MR OHIRA'S PROPOSAL AT THIS STAGE, THE  AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT HAS IN IT IA T E D  A STUDY WITH THE INTENTION OF   DISCUSSING IT WITHIN THE REGION AS AND WHEN OUR THINKING DEVELOPS   AND MATURE:. WHAT IS OBVIOUS FROM THE START IS THAT NO BALANCED   JUDGEMENT CAN BE MADE UNTIL THE FULL IMPLICATIONS OF THE CONCEPT   HAVE BEEN MULLED OVER AMONG THE COUNTRIES OF THE REGION.

IT  IS IMPORTANT - INDEED VITAL -  THAT ANY PROPOSALS THAT ARE   FLOATED REFLECT AN EMERGING REGIONAL CONSENSUS. ANY PROPOSAL THAT   DID NOT REFLECT THE ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL REALITIES AND THAT DID NOT   ACCOMMODATE THE LEGITIMATE INTERESTS OF THE COUNTRIES OF THE REGION

COULD SERIOUSLY RETARD PROGRESS TOWARDS SOME FORM OF REGIONAL COÂ­ OPERATION IN THE LONGER TERM. THE SUCCESS OF REGIONAL CO-OPERATION   WILL DEPEND ULTIMATELY UPON THE IDENTIFIC ATION OF SHARED INTERESTS   AND PERCEIVED MUTUAL BENEFITS.

I BELIEVE THE PRIVATE SECTOR WILL HAVE AN IMPORTANT ROLE TO PLAY   IN INFLUENCING THE DIRECTION DISCUSSION OF THE ISSUE TAKES. THE   PACIFIC BASIN ECONOMIC COUNCIL WHICH MET HERE IN LOS ANGELES EARLIER   THIS YEAR IS WELL PLACED TO MAKE AN EFFECTIVE CONTRIBUTION TO THE   DEBATE. THE COUNCIL HAS A WIDE MEMBERSHIP AMONG THE BUSINESS COMMUNÂ­

I T I E S  OF THE REGION. IT HAS VALUABLE EXPERIENCE AND_KN0WLED6E   WHICH WILL PROVE A ' GREAT ASSET “WHEN THE, COUNCIL MEETS IN SYDNEY NEXT   MAY TO "DISCUSS THE IDEA OF A PACIFIC COMMUNITY.

I HAVE SPOKEN ABOUT THE CHANGING REALITIES IN THE AS IA N /P A C IFIC   REGION. I HAVE EMPHASISED THE NEW PERSPECTIVES THAT AUSTRALIA HAS   DEVELOPED. BUT THE V IT A L IT Y  OF THE ANZUS RELATIONSHIP IS A SALUTARY   REMINDER THAT CONTINUITY CAN BE AS IMPORTANT AS CHANGE. ANZUS   RETAINS ITS RELEVANCE NOT ONLY BECAUSE IT CONTINUES TO REST UPON A   SENSE OF COMMON PURPOSE AND A SHARED OUTLOOK -  EXPRESSED IN A GREAT   VARIETY OF FORMS OF CO-OPERATION -  BUT ALSO BECAUSE IT HAS THE CAPACÂ­

ITY TO ADJUST TO CHANGING RE A LITIE S . '

THIS WAS BROUGHT. HOME VIV ID L Y  AT THE MOST RECENT MEETING OF THE   ANZUS COUNCIL IN CANBERRA IN JULY THIS YEAR. WHO -  TEN, EVEN FIVE   YEARS AGO -  WOULD HAVE IMAGINED THAT THE AGENDA OF THE ANZUS COUNCIL   WOULD HAVE INCLUDED SUCH VARIED SUBJECTS AS ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT   AND THE NORTH/SOUTH DIALOGUE, THE INDO-CHINA REFUGEE CRISIS AND   POSSIBLE NEW FORMS OF REGIONAL CO-OPERATION. THIS DEMONSTRATED

CAPACITY TO RESPOND TO THE CHALLENGES OF NEW CIRCUMSTANCES WILL BE ÃÂ®   VITAL ASSET AS THE ANZUS PARTNERS CONFRONT ÃÂ¤ÃÂÃÂ MANY UNCERTAINTIES OF   THE COMING YEARS.

MR CHAIRMAN, . ECONOMIC GROWTH IN THE A S IA /P A C IF IC  REGION IS  OPENING UP  TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITIES. THE WAY IN WHICH WE GRASP THESE OPPORTUNÂ­ I T I E S  WILL DO MUCH TO INFLUENCE AND SHAPE REGIONAL RELATIONSHIPS WELL

INTO THE NEXT CENTURY. I WANT TO LEAVE YOU WITH THE THOUGHT THAT  THE UNITED STATES HAS A SUBSTANTIAL INTEREST, A SIGNAL OPPORTUNITY  AND A MAJOR CONTRIBUTION TO MAKE IN ALL THESE DEVELOPMENTS WHICH  ARE SLOWLY BUT SURELY TRANSFORMING THE A S IA /P A C lE lC  REGION.
