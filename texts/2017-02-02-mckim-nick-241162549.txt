Media Release: Ditch the deal and bring the refugees to Australia

February 2, 2017

Malcolm Turnbull should scrap his refugee "deal" with the US and bring people  detained on Manus Island and Nauru to Australia , Greens Immigration  spokesperson Nick McKim says.

"It is becoming increasingly clear that Mr Turnbull is placing his faith in a xenophobic  and anti-immigration US President who has a track record of dishonesty and  lies," Senator McKim said.

"Only a fool would take Trump at his word."

"As confirmed by Immigration Department Secretary Mike Pezzullo to a Senate  Committee late last year, this so-called deal does not commit the United States to  accept a single refugee."

"All that has been accomplished is to create further uncertainty for people who have  suffered so greatly at Australia's hands."

"Clearly, it has also compromised an already weak Prime Minister from standing up  to a dangerous and unstable US President."
