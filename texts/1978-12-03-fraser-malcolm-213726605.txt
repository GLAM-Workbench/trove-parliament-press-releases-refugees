PRIME MINISTER

FOR PRESS 3 DECEMBER 1978

ELECTORATE TALK

Since coming to office, your Government has followed policies  consistently designed to sustain economic growth and thus  provide employment opportunities.

There is no easy w a y . We have not been seduced by demands for  politically expedient, short-term palliatives. Such policies  would do no more than fuel the fires of inflation without  curing the problem. .

Our policies are long-term ones that will put Australian  industry and commerce once more back on a sound base, and  from that base will come a resurgence of job opportunities. . It won't happen overnight, but already there are encouraging  signs:  inflation is down substantially, interest rates are coming down, investment is picking up, order books are filling  up, and once more some major Australian companies are gearing  up their export, divisions.

Despite the progress we have made there is still much to be  done. The Government is not sitting idly by waiting for a  magic solution.  Over the past few days we have taken major  new steps to up-date our policies, to meet the changing needs

of our time.

The creation of the new.Commonwealth Department of Employment  and Youth Affairs is a positive example of the great importance  your Government places on giving attention to employment,  particularly employment opportunities for young people.

More recently, we have taken initiatives to underline the  Government's determination to gain every possible benefit  from technical innovation, both here and overseas, and acquire  a better understanding of the labour market.

Your Government has decided to set up a Committee of Inquiry .   to examine, report and make recommendations on the process  of technological change in Australian industry. The Union  Movement will have representation on the Inquiry. ,

Much work in the field of technological change —  the so-called  1  computer revolution'  —  has been pioneered by the Department  of Productivity, established by the Government just on two  years ago. However, the new Inquiry will place emphasis on .   maximising the economic and social benefits of the technological

revolution and minimising any adverse consequences.

The second initiative will involve the Government in joining  with industry and the unions in a wide ranging study of labour  market problems posed by such things as penalty rates, weekend  and part-time work, juniors, job-sharing and trade skills.

This Inquiry, agreed to by the National Labour Consultative  Committee, will be headed by the Chairman of the State Electricity  Commission of Victoria, Mr Trethowan.

Both moves demonstrate the Government's real concern for problems  forced on an established workforce by a changing technology. But this is not a job for the Commonwealth, industry and unions.   The States too have an important role to play. I have therefore  written to the Premiers, asking them to co-operate in a review

of all areas of State responsibility which may contribute to  unemployment or which may reveal scope for encouraging employment.

It may well be that some State legislative or institutional  arrangements are having an adverse effect on employment. For  example, there are inconsistencies between States in such matters  as standards and regulations. This is particularly true in the

construction industry, where undoubtedly it has an adverse  effect on employment opportunities.

There is also no doubt that some State taxes and charges provide  a financial burden on industry and discourage increased job  opportunities. In the same general area, employment conditions  which result in increased costs for industry, such as high

standards of long service leave, also restrict employment  opportunities.

I have asked the State Premiers to give serious consideration  to these questions, and I believe that considerable benefits  for employment could flow from such an examination.
