E&OE……………………….……………………………………………………………

TONY ABBOTT:

ItÃ¢ÂÂs great to be here today at Paradise Lagoons. I want to thank Graeme Acton and his family for making me  and Ken OÃ¢ÂÂDowd and Senator Ian Macdonald so welcome. This is a multi-generation family property and  Australian governments should make it easier for people to stay on the land, not harder. Now, the cattle  industry has been doing it tough for a long time. What weÃ¢ÂÂve seen is a monumental disaster from  government when the ineptitude of the Gillard Government has put the live cattle export trade to Indonesia  in complete jeopardy. This is monumental incompetence from government and the last thing that the cattle  industry would want is to see what they believe is the most incompetent government in living memory try to  execute the most complex policy in living memory with a carbon tax. Because the cattle industry has been  doing it so tough for so long, the last thing they need now is a carbon tax which will just put their costs up  and up. Power and transport are a very important component of the costs of the cattle industry and, as we  know, power and transport will be the principal focus of cost increases under the carbon tax.

So, I say to the Prime Minister, look, if you are fair dinkum about wearing out your shoe leather, you wonÃ¢ÂÂt  just walk down to the National Press Club, you wonÃ¢ÂÂt just go down to Melbourne to talk with Tony Blair,  youÃ¢ÂÂll actually be out in regional Australia and what weÃ¢ÂÂve seen from the Prime Minister is that it looks like  sheÃ¢ÂÂs surrendered. It looks like sheÃ¢ÂÂs admitted defeat. It looks like sheÃ¢ÂÂs given up wearing out the shoe  leather. The shoes have got holes in them because for the last few days, if sheÃ¢ÂÂs left Canberra, it hasnÃ¢ÂÂt been  to talk about the carbon tax package because she seems to have worked out that the more she talks about it,  the less people like it. She seems to have worked out that the more she talks about it, the more toxic this  carbon tax seems to the Australian people

So, IÃ¢ÂÂm going to ask Graeme to say a few words and then I might ask Ken to say a few words and then I  might have a bit to say about a couple of other political issues.

Graeme?

GRAEME ACTON:

Yes, thanks Tony. ItÃ¢ÂÂs great that youÃ¢ÂÂve come out here into the centre of some of the great cattle country in  Australia and youÃ¢ÂÂve identified the great negatives with this carbon tax. Timing is everything in any  industry. WeÃ¢ÂÂve just seen the greatest debacle, as you say, thatÃ¢ÂÂs happened with one of our major trading  partners. The Government has no responsibility, no idea of doing business and we are very grateful that you  have come out here and the philosophies that youÃ¢ÂÂve exposed to us this morning and, as I say, timing is  everything and to put a tax - an extra cost on the agricultural industry at a stage when nations such as the  USA and the European nations are suffering dramatically with cost labour burdens - is absolutely ludicrous  and shows the misunderstanding and the unbusinesslike government that we have in power here today and  the sooner that Tony and his party can get back into power and I would encourage and I would probably  plead with the people of Australia to understand, this is a wonderful nation and we need good governance to  keep us all in the way weÃ¢ÂÂve been kept in the last few decades. IÃ¢ÂÂd encourage the Australian people to vote  for a government that has business acumen and can manage the economy of this nation.

TONY ABBOTT:

Thanks Graeme. Ken?

KEN O’DOWD:

IÃ¢ÂÂd like the thank Tony and Graeme for his hospitality here this morning but just to add to the cattle markets,  thereÃ¢ÂÂs still another hurdle to go and that is thereÃ¢ÂÂs going to be a private members bill introduced into the  parliament and they want to stop live cattle exports altogether. They donÃ¢ÂÂt want to see it ever again for  Australia and thatÃ¢ÂÂs cattle, sheep, anything else we do, horses, they want to put a stop to everything and that  is bad for us and bad for central Queensland and the other thing so inappropriate today is the carbon tax,  here we are at the heart of the coal country and thanks Tony for coming here for that, this is going to have  big impacts. Add a mining tax to a carbon tax to a renewable energy tax, which is just another slug, it just  spells disaster. There are already 600 Australian companies working in South Africa and other parts of  Africa. ThereÃ¢ÂÂs 250 projects going in Africa at the moment by Australian companies and youÃ¢ÂÂll watch them  go offshore very quickly once these taxes are introduced.

TONY ABBOTT:

When it comes to the Malaysian people swap this is wrong on three grounds. ItÃ¢ÂÂs wrong because it is yet  another broken promise. The Prime Minister declaimed so self-righteously just a few months ago that the  Government would never send boat people to a country that hadnÃ¢ÂÂt signed the UN refugee convention and  Malaysia hasnÃ¢ÂÂt signed it and has no intention of signing it. So, itÃ¢ÂÂs wrong on that score. ItÃ¢ÂÂs wrong because  itÃ¢ÂÂs a terrible admission of defeat by this Government which has been claiming for years that boats were  arriving because of push factors, now itÃ¢ÂÂs finally accepted that it is pull factors all along that have been  bringing the boats our way. Finally, I doubt very much that it will work.

In the time since the Malaysian people swap was first announced weÃ¢ÂÂve had 11 boats and 567 illegal  arrivals. If announcing the deal didnÃ¢ÂÂt stop the boats thereÃ¢ÂÂs very little to believe that signing the deal is  going to stop the boats. What the Prime Minister should do, itÃ¢ÂÂs not too late, is pick up the phone to the  President of Nauru because Nauru is ready, willing and able to open the detention centre there. We know it  will work in the future because itÃ¢ÂÂs worked in the past and the thing about detaining boat people in Nauru is  that they will be looked after in accordance with our standards, not in accordance with the very different  standards that Malaysia applies. Now, IÃ¢ÂÂm not against Malaysia. Malaysia is a good friend and neighbour of  Australia, but their standards when it comes to human rights are quite different from our standards. Once  people get to Australia they should be looked after in accordance with Australian standards of human rights,  not the very different standards that apply in countries like Malaysia.

QUESTION:

The Malaysian Government, though, has committed to honouring those human rights. Are you worried that  you are offending them by saying that they are not going to keep that deal?

TONY ABBOTT:

IÃ¢ÂÂm just saying that once people have arrived in Malaysia they are going to be looked after in accordance  with Malaysian standards. Now, Malaysian standards are perfectly alright for Malaysia. But ours are  different and we should look after people in accordance with our standards, not theirs, and that certainly  wonÃ¢ÂÂt happen under this deal.

QUESTION:

So, youÃ¢ÂÂre saying the deal signed yesterday was for Malaysian human rights, that thatÃ¢ÂÂs the agreement  theyÃ¢ÂÂve signed or thatÃ¢ÂÂs the only one theyÃ¢ÂÂre going to keep?

TONY ABBOTT:

IÃ¢ÂÂm just saying that when people are in Malaysia, self-evidently they are going to be looked after in  accordance with Malaysian standards. That just stands to reason. The Australian Government is not  sovereign in Malaysia. The Malaysian Government is sovereign in Malaysia. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs as it is, as it should be,  and that means that people are going to be looked after in Malaysia in accordance with Malaysian standards  and they are quite different from ours.

QUESTION:

What exactly is different about them?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, to start off with - as anyone who has watched some of the television programmes that weÃ¢ÂÂve seen  recently would know - their camps are different, their detention centres are different, their work practices  are different, their education and health systems are different and most importantly their systems of justice  are different and people in Malaysia are subject to the kind of punishments which we would regard as  unacceptable in this country. Now, again I stress I make no judgment on what Malaysia thinks is appropriate  for people in Malaysia, thatÃ¢ÂÂs their business. But it is our business what happens to people who have come to  Australia and claimed Australian protection.

QUESTION:

You mentioned that the UNHCR didnÃ¢ÂÂt sign the Malaysian solution, yet they didnÃ¢ÂÂt sign the Pacific Solution  either. What would you say to that?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, we never said that a UNHCR sign-off was necessary for any border protection policy that we put in  place, but large numbers of the Labor caucus have said that they canÃ¢ÂÂt possibly support the Malaysian people  swap without a sign-off from the UN High Commissioner for Refugees and plainly that hasnÃ¢ÂÂt happened.  Now, I challenge members of the Labor caucus to maintain their principles in the face of a Government  which is doing what - if it was done by the Howard Government - would have had every human rights  activist in the country up in arms and I would hate to see that members of the Labor Left turn out to have  very flexible consciences when it comes to the practices of their own Government.

QUESTION:

But doesnÃ¢ÂÂt that mean that this deal is along the lines of Coalition policy and shouldnÃ¢ÂÂt you be applauding it,  then?

TONY ABBOTT:

This deal is very different from the CoalitionÃ¢ÂÂs policy. The CoalitionÃ¢ÂÂs policy is to reopen the detention  centre in Nauru. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs our position. It worked in the past, it can work in the future and people who are dealt  with in Nauru will be dealt with in accordance with Australian standards.

QUESTION:

What about the moves to open Manus Island?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, again, yet another blunder, yet more evidence of the fact that this Government is much better at  announcing things than delivering on things. They announced an East Timor solution and it never happened.  They announced a Manus solution and it hasnÃ¢ÂÂt happened. They announced a Malaysian solution and it took  almost three months to get it in place. It seems that the Australian Government has been at the mercy of  Malaysian negotiators through that period and in the process weÃ¢ÂÂve had 567 boat people arrive, 11 boats. So,  itÃ¢ÂÂs a deal that hasnÃ¢ÂÂt worked since it was announced and is unlikely to be any different just because itÃ¢ÂÂs been  signed.

ThereÃ¢ÂÂs just one more point I might make on the carbon tax. Look, a lot of people say that this carbon tax is  a done deal. Wrong, wrong. There is a lot of unhappiness in the caucus about this carbon tax because there  are lots of members of the caucus who know that this is a Greens tax, itÃ¢ÂÂs not a caucus tax. This is a tax  which has been driven by Bob Brown and the Greens. ItÃ¢ÂÂs not something that has been negotiated by the  caucus. So, I say to Labor members of parliament whose electorates are going to be severely affected by the  carbon tax: “stand up for jobs in your electorates and stop making excuses for this toxic tax.”

Now, IÃ¢ÂÂm not far from the electorate of Capricornia. Capricornia has a cattle industry, it has a coal industry.  The coal industry in particular is going to be very severely prejudiced by the carbon tax and if Kirsten  Livermore is serious about being CapricorniaÃ¢ÂÂs representative in Canberra rather than just Julia GillardÃ¢ÂÂs  echo in Rockhampton she will say no to this toxic tax and I call on Labor members right around the country  to follow the lead of union officials like Tony Sheldon and Dean Mighell in saying “this tax is not going to  be good for us; this tax is not going to be good for jobs in my area.”

QUESTION:

Under your policy I understand there will be financial penalties for companies who increase their emissions  intensity. IsnÃ¢ÂÂt that another form of carbon tax?

TONY ABBOTT:

No itÃ¢ÂÂs not because Australian companies are reducing their emissions intensity. Take a company like  Linfox, Linfox has reduced its emissions by 35 per cent on 2007 figures simply by better driving and  sensible practices such as getting more natural light into its warehouses. Now, this is something which a  company like Linfox has done without a carbon tax because it makes economic sense to reduce your energy  usage. Now, Australian companies are doing this all the time. They are going to keep doing this. They donÃ¢ÂÂt  need a carbon tax. What they could use is some significant incentives to keep doing what they are already  doing to work with the grain of Australian business with incentives rather than with penalties.

QUESTION:

The President of the Czech Republic opposes climate change. Will you be meeting with President Klaus  while heÃ¢ÂÂs in Australia?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, President Klaus is a very reputable international leader. HeÃ¢ÂÂs not in my diary but if I did get the  chance to meet up with him I would regard that as an honour.

QUESTION:

After the tragedy in Norway do you support the Christian LobbyÃ¢ÂÂs push for tougher penalties on video  games and also another push for a crackdown on gun laws being pushed by the Greens on semi-automatic  weapons, in particular?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, I fully supported the Howard GovernmentÃ¢ÂÂs dramatic change and improvement to gun laws. I think  since the Howard Government crackdown on semi-automatic weapons the situation in Australia has been  radically different from the situation in Norway. Now, as for these horrific videos I dislike them intensely.  IÃ¢ÂÂve never been against censorship but itÃ¢ÂÂs got to be effective censorship and IÃ¢ÂÂd want to see what any  proposals might be before I signed up to them.

QUESTION:

In regards to Malaysia, Minister Bowen has indicated this morning that thereÃ¢ÂÂs the likelihood that theyÃ¢ÂÂll  increase above 800. What are your thoughts in regards to that?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well you know, this is a government which is constantly making announcements that donÃ¢ÂÂt then come true.  He made an announcement that there was going to be a Malaysian deal two-and-a-half months ago, itÃ¢ÂÂs only  through sell-out after sell-out that the deal is finally signed. You just canÃ¢ÂÂt trust this government. You  couldnÃ¢ÂÂt trust the Prime Minister when she said thereÃ¢ÂÂd be “no carbon tax under the government I lead.” You  couldnÃ¢ÂÂt trust the Prime Minister when she said that she wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt send boat people to a country that hadnÃ¢ÂÂt  signed the UN Convention. You couldnÃ¢ÂÂt trust Minister Bowen when he said that all of the people who have  arrived since the Malaysian announcement was first made will be processed offshore. I mean, almost  nothing they say turns out to be followed through in practice. They are chronically untruthful. They suffer  from Ã¢ÂÂTDDÃ¢ÂÂ - truth deficit disorder; and I just would believe anything they say when you actually see it with  your own eyes.
