JOINT STATEMENT BY THE LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION, THE HON. ANDREW  PEACOCK, MP, AND THE SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND ETHNIC  AFFAIRS, THE HON. MICHAEL HODGMAN, MP, TO AN ETHNIC MEDIA  CONFERENCE .IN MELBOURNE .TODAY..

The Leader of the Opposition, the Hon. Andrew Peacock, MP,  today described the Hawke Labor Government's handling of  Immigration and Ethnic Affairs Policies as 1  an absolute disaster'.

"Immigration and Ethnic Affairs will be one of the major  issues in the forthcoming Federal Election," Mr Peacock predicted.

Mr Peacock said that the Hawke Government had broken its  pre-Election commitment as to the size of the Migration intake; "  it had practically abolished Ministerial discretion; it had upset  many people by destroying the Australian Institute of Multicultural

Affairs; and, it had politicised Australia's Refugee intake,  and  Ethnic Affairs generally.

Mr Peacock pledged that a Liberal/National Party Federal  Government would

.  restore humanitarianism and compassion to Australia's  Immigration Policy;

. reintroduce Ministerial discretion for appropriate cases;

. increase the Family Reunion Programme;

. 'eliminate discrimination on the grounds of Ethnic  .  origin; and

. depoliticise Ethnic Affairs Policies and Programmes.

"Under the Hawke Labor Government, Immigration and Ethnic  .  Affairs Policies have taken a dangerous and radical turn to the  Left. Mr West is simply listening to the wrong people and  pandering to extremist elements who do not represent majority

opinions in Australia's Ethnic Communities. The Hawke Labor  Government has already destroyed the Australian Institute of  Multicultural Affairs and now is turning its attention to the  Special Broadcasting Service - a major initiative of the Fraser  Government," Mr Peacock said.

Mr Peacock said that his Government would ensure 1  a  balanced, non^politieal and equitable Migration Policy and a fair  deal for Ethnic communities - free from political favouritism,  nepotism and string pulling.1  .
