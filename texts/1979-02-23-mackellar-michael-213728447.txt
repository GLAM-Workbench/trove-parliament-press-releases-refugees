#50,000 COMMONWEALTH GRANT TO  AID MARRICKVILLE MIGRANTS

A Commonwealth grant totalling $51Â»750 over three

years will enable the Centre for Human Services to improve

life for migrants in the Marrickville area of Sydney.

The grant is in line with the Galbally Report

on Programs and Services to Migrants which made more than 50

major recommendations requiring additional Commonwealth

expenditure over three years.

Announcing the grant tochay, the Minister for

Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Mr MacKellar,  said Marrickville,

with 43 per cent overseas born, had the highest migrant

concentration in Sydney and one of the highest in Australia.

The largest ethnic groups were Greeks, followed

by Yugoslavs, Lebanese and Turks, and a growing number of

refugees. r

Various objective social indicators showed the

area to be one of the most disadvantaged in Australia.

"It is apparent that many of these disadvantages

are aggravated by the difficulties newcomers face in settling

in Australia," Mr MacKellar said.

"Nearly one in five of the overseas-born have no

skill in English and the generation gap which most Australians

experience is exaggerated by conflict between traditional

attitudes and those learnt here."

The Commonwealth grant would enable the Centre

for Human Services to employ an experienced social worker.
