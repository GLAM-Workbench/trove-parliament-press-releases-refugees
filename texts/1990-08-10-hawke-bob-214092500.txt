PRIME MINISTER

TRANSCRIPT OF NEWS CONFERENCE, PARLIAMENT HOUSE,  10 AUGUST 1990

E & OE - PROOF ONLY

PM: The decisions I'm about to announce of course are  against the background of Australia's total unequivocal  condemnation of the invasion by Iraq of Kuwait and its  subsequent reported annexation. We join with the rest of  the world in saying that we will not tolerate, will not

stand idly by while any member of the international  community purports to break the rules of civilised  conduct in that way. We've been considering what more  should be done in addition to our joining with the rest  of the world in imposing sanctions, to give an additional

response to what is happening in the gulf. We have been  in contact with Washington on this issue. I have  discussed the matter with a number of my Ministers, the  Deputy Prime Minister Paul Keating, with Ministers Evans,  Ray, Duffy and Button. And against that preparatory  thinking that w e 've been undertaking President Bush  called me this morning, I had a lengthy conversation with  him. And out of that conversation we agreed that  Australia would contribute to a multinational task force  in the gulf. Let me make it clear that the primary  purpose of that multinational naval task force will be to  enforce the blockade on Iraq and Kuwait and of course to  protect the exports from other oil producing gulf  countries and to protect other trade in the gulf. That's  its primary purpose, to enforce the blockade and to keep  other trade free. But by its very nature its worth  saying that the force will contribute to the deterrence  we believe of further aggression by Iraq. Obviously when  a decision of this sort is made there is a number of  important issues of detail that have to be resolved and  there will be discussions going on now between the United  States people and ourselves to deal with those matters.   Without being exhaustive they obviously include the  question of the status of the force, what the other  membership of it will be and the command structure.  Our  ships of course will remain under Australian National  command, but they may operate when they get there,  under  US or some other form of actual operation control. Now  these issues are important issues and they will be  discussed now in the hours and the days ahead.  We will  send two guided missile frigates, FFG's, the Adelaide and  Darwin and they will be supported by the replenishment  tanker Success. Let me say, and if you want to go to any  more technical questions on these matters. Admiral

Beaumont is available. But let me say that these two  FFG's are extremely capable ships with comprehensive self  defence capability. They have a Standard air defence  missile, Close In Weapons System, the Harpoon Anti-Ship  Missile, Electronic counter measures and they will also  be equipped with Sea Hawk helicopters. Each frigate has  a crew of approximately two hundred,  that's for each of  the frigates and also the Success has a crew of the same  magnitude. I'm given to understand that the ships will  be able to leave Australia within five days and they will  be on station within twenty two days. Let me say that we  understand that in making this decision the deployment  may involve significant risks. It is a potentially high  threat environment into which the ships will be moving,  but we have profound faith in the equipment and the  training of our men in their capacity to meet any  situation which they will be confronted. The actual  conditions of service and other aspects will be  considered by Cabinet, but let me make it quite clear  directly to the members of our naval forces that are  concerned and to the public that the Australian  Government will be providing conditions commensurate with  the serious nature of this deployment. So I conclude  ladies and gentlemen as I began by saying that what we  are witnessing in the gulf at the moment is a series of  actions and threats which are entirely unacceptable to  the Australian Government and we are prepared to play a  responsible part in seeking to ensure that this  aggression is deterred and that the blockade that has  been decided upon and the embargoes that have been  imposed should be effective. And I express the hope that  in this way a further escalation of conflict will be  avoided and the hope that President Suddam Hussein will  understand that the only sensible course of action now is  to withdraw his forces from Kuwait and to allow the  restoration of the former government in that country.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister is Australia responding to a  request from the United States or is this offer made off  our own bat?

PM: The matter was raised with us initially in the  United States and we therefore responded.  We had  discussions with them there and it was out of those  preliminary discussions that were initiated from the  United States that the President rang me today and that  out of those discussions we agreed that this Australian  naval asset would be provided.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister these United Nations  sanctions, wouldn't it have been better to wait for the  United Nations or seek a United Nations response before  committing ships?

PM: We can always find a reason and an excuse for not playing a responsible role in a threatening situation and  if we had wanted to do that yes we could have easily done  that, but I believe that the gravity of the situation is

3

such that it warranted this action at this time by  Australia. Obviously I believe it would be the  preference of the United States as well as of Australia  that there could be a United Nations flag operation and

that is not out of the question. It may be that that  emerges. But in circumstances of this kind I think it's  not appropriate to wait until the ideal actually emerges,  but if that can emerge Australia will be very happy.

JOURNALIST: What other countries are going to be  involved in this force?

PM: Well already you will appreciate that there are  naval forces there. You've got the United States, you've  got Britain and you've got the Dutch.  The Italians are  going to be providing facilities and there is the NATO  meeting today in Paris in which this whole issue will be

discussed. So obviously a number of West Europeans will  be involved and I know that the matter is being  considered by our friends in Canada. I have had  discussions by telephone with my friend Brian Mulroney  and no decision has been made there, but the matter is  being considered in Canada. It may be also that Japan  could be involved.

JOURNALIST:  Any discussion Prime Minister of aircraft or  ground crews?

PM: No. There has been no question raised of any other  Australian commitment other than the naval assets to  which I have referred.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister US television networks have  reported that you at some stage actually phoned President  Bush, was there an earlier conversation?

PM: No I didn't phone President Bush. But as I said quite straightforwardly there had been earlier  discussions at officials levels initiated in the first  place by the United States, but the only contact between  President Bush and myself was the phone call from him to  me this morning.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister did President Bush give you  an assessment this morning of the likelihood of the  conflict escalating?

PM: Well he was - you'll appreciate there are some  aspects of the conversation that I can't make public -  but I think I can say this, that the President was  optimistic about the degree of support that was being  proffered. For instance in an operational sense he  indicated that port facilities would be available in some  neighbouring States, I won't name them for obvious  reasons, but it wouldn't be therefore a situation that  our naval forces would be operating ... without access to  relatively adjacent port facilities.

JOURNALIST: Have you thought how long you might leave  these ships there? The reason I ask is that I understand  Iraq has ... supplies and it will be months before these

sanctions bite, and secondly where are these three ships  at the moment?

PM: The two that we're talking about,  the Adelaide and  Darwin - where are they Admiral?

ADMIRAL BEAUMONT: Eastern Australia. In Sydney.

PM: They are actually in Sydney.  They are in Sydney.  And the Success. And as I say, I'm informed it's five  days, within five days.

ADMIRAL BEAUMONT: They sail on Monday Prime Minister.

PM: Yes, they sail on Monday.

JOURNALIST: In the past both Presidents Carter and  Reagan faced some pretty important consequences as a  result of deploying forces into the Middle East. What  are your apprehensions about sending an Australian  contingent, given that background?

PM: Well these are not decisions that any Prime Minister here or President of the United States makes lightly,  because the record of the Government with which we are  now particularly concerned is not a terribly attractive  one. The United States particularly has a large number  of people who are being detained in Iraq and Baghdad.  We  are doing everything we can of course to try and protect  the welfare and the safety of Australian citizens. We  are in constant communication, not only of course with  our own diplomatic representatives but they with other

like-minded countries. We will do everything we can to  ensure the safety of Australians. But when you're faced  with a situation like this you've, I believe, got to make  the decisions which you believe are most calculated to  bring about a situation where the aggressor will  understand that a continuation of those actions is not  only not acceptable to the international community but

that any intelligent assessment of self-interest on the  part of Iraq must lead to the conclusion that the troops  should be withdrawn.

JOURNALIST: ... first question Prime Minister, how long  are we likely to stay there given Iraq's ...?

PM: I'm sorry Laurie. Well, obviously I can't give a  definitive answer to that. I can express the hope that  it would be a relatively short period. But you are right  in referring to the fact that there is, according to the  reports, a fairly substantial reserve of foodstuffs. We  understand for instance that there's something like six  months' supply of grain there in Iraq. But there is  already, may I say, an impact of the sanctions. For

instance, in regard to both pipelines, that is the

5

pipelines across Turkey and across Saudi Arabia, there  are no tankers loading and those pipelines are now not  operating. They will already be suffering an impact upon  their receipts. And of course any expectation that they  may have had about being able to receive the income from

the very substantial Kuwaiti assets abroad,  has "been  frustrated by the action that's been taken around the  world including here in Australia to freeze those assets.  So Laurie I think that in fact you'll already be starting

to get a very significant impact, and that's an impact  which will escalate in economic terms very significantly  in the days and weeks ahead.  So I repeat,  that any  intelligent rational assessment by the leadership of Iraq

ought to lead to the conclusion that their best interests  are served by a withdrawal.  Now, unfortunately, we can't  proceed on the basis that rational, intelligent  assessments will be the only criteria in considerations  which lead to action there.  So I can't be dishonest to

say I know how long, but I think what is true, Laurie, is  that the more nations like Australia with a capacity to  make a commitment as I've made, the more this is done and  the more that the leadership of Iraq understands that

they are confronting a very, very comprehensive  opposition to their position, the more likely it is that  we will be looking at a relatively short period. May I  finally say, in answer to your question, that I think  you'11 agree that an important part in this gathering of

a representative opposition will be what is done by parts  of the Arab world and I'm hopeful that there may be some  accession of Arab forces in those that will be lined up  in opposition to Iraq.

JOURNALIST: Despite the petrol price freeze, some of the  impact of the Gulf conflict will feed through to the  September quarter CPI. Do you believe this should be  discounted from the wage increase that will flow as a  result?

PM: Well, frankly, I have, as a result of the action  that the Treasurer took yesterday on behalf of the  Government that we won't actually see any significant  feed through, so to that extent I hope, Milton, that the  question remains hypothetical and I therefore, you know,  don't address it now. I mean, if the issue arises, we'll

address it at the time.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, just to clear up something -PM: Yes, sure.

JOURNALIST: Are we committed for the duration of the  blockade?

PM: Yes, we, as I've said, the primary purpose of the commitment of the Australian naval forces is to enforce  the blockade and that's on Iraq and Kuwait and to  protect, as I say, the movement of other oil producers in

6

the region and our intention would be to commit these  forces for as long as is necessary to successfully  achieve that primary purpose.

JOURNALIST: Do you believe it would be necessary to  protect our personnel in the Navy from the possible use  of chemical weapons?

PM: Well, I'm sure that our naval authorities will be  completely aware of the environment and the potential  dangers into which they are moving and that they'11 have

all the appropriate protective apparatus. But when I've  finished, if you want to address any, as I say, technical  question like that, but that would be my obvious  assumption.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister -PM: And I see from the affirmative nod of the Admiral,  that the Prime Ministerial assumption is correct.

JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, do you see the need to increase  security on our shores because of any possible terrorist  threats ... arising from our involvement?

PM: Well, we have, as a Government, have attached very  considerable importance to ensuring the capacity of  Australia, both by our own efforts and by a high degree  of cooperation with other nations, having the capacity to  meet any terrorist threat.  We haven't been slack in that

regard in the past and I would believe that in the  circumstances all those who have a responsibility in this  area would be particularly alert.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, ... indications last night  that you'd wait till next week before announcing a  decision, did President Bush urge you to make an  announcement more quickly than -PM: No, as I've said to you, my dear friends, before and

I say it again, don't get led away by what you write  yourself in creating an expectation for me about my  parameters and framework of decision-making. I mean, you  don't do it and you haven't on this occasion.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, has any assessment been made  of the likely Iraqi reaction, especially with regards  Australians that are still in Iraq or in Kuwait?

PM: Well, let me say this. As you would imagine I have  been following these issues almost on an hourly basis  since the crisis arose and I have been reassured in my  reading of the continuous stream of cables about the fact  that our representative in Baghdad is in continuous  contact with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs there about  the welfare of Australian citizens and is doing that in  very significant cooperation with other like-minded  countries.  So I can assure you that up till this point,

7

we've been doing all that we can and clearly in these  circumstances we'11 continue to do that.

JOURNALIST: Is there any contingency for an adverse  reaction by the Iraqis to our sending ships to the Gulf?

PM: Well, the point I'm making is I don't think we could  have been, up until this point, doing more than we have  been doing to try and secure the safety of Australians in  the region and we'll continue to do that.

JOURNALIST: What is the extent of Australian role here?  You've said that it's mainly an enforcement mechanism for  the sanctions that are imposed, you've also said that US

ships would be in control of the Australian ships ...

PM: ... that could be, well ...

JOURNALIST: I'm just wondering, do you say that  Australian ships will not be involved in any direct  military attack or support for it ...

PM: Let me, yes, that's a good question. ... I have  said what the purpose is, what the agreement has been.  If there were any request to escalate the role of our  assets, then that would be a matter for request,

discussion, negotiation and then decision.

JOURNALIST: A related question, Prime Minister.

PM: Yes.

JOURNALIST: Is this the absolute limit of our  involvement, having ruled out the use of ground troops  and our aircraft ...

PM: Well, Laurie, no question has been raised about that  and I will be totally frank with you in this, no question  has been raised about it. It's our belief that the best  that Australia, the most effective contribution that  Australia can make is the one that we are making and I  don't anticipate any request for assets from our airforce  or from the army. I don't anticipate any requests  because I don't think, in that respect, we are likely to  be seen as able to be as effective by way of contribution  as we are in our naval assets. If, and this is purely

... if such a request were at any time in the future to  be made, we would obviously consider it, but I doubt that  any such request would be made.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, what are the chances of ... boosting our naval contribution to the blockade?

PM: Well, let me say this, that the President was very grateful for the commitment that I made. It's seen as a  very significant contribution and indeed when you look at  our size, by any objective assessment, it is a

significant contribution and again, from the

8

conversations that I ’ve had and that have been held by  our representatives, I don't anticipate that there will  be a request for any larger commitment of our naval  assets.  Again, let me say this, if a situation arose  where there were to be such a request we'd examine it,  but I don't expect that such a request will be made.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, have you discussed this  commitment with any of the Arab countries and  particularly Saudi Arabia?

PM: No.

JOURNALIST: Did you have any discussions with President  Bush or have you got any information on the likely  strength of Arab ... on this?

PM: I did have a discussion with President Bush about  this. I do have some understanding of his expectations,   but I think,  for reasons you'll understand,  I can't go to  that.

JOURNALIST: What about the security of Australians  elsewhere in the region, such as Saudi Arabia and  Bahrain, other States?

PM: Well, ... the comments that I made before about the  safety of Australian citizens apply to those regions.  Just, if I could refer to, give you some numbers. We  know of 55 Australians in Iraq, about 3,000 in Saudi  Arabia and less than 20 in Kuwait. I won't go to

individuals, there is some information about some  individuals, but that’s the disposition, as it were, of  Australians in the region and in each of those areas we  are, either through our own diplomatic presence or in the  case of areas where we don't have representation through  other friendly embassies, we are in constant  communication.  We don't have reason at the moment to  believe that all Australians, for instance, need to be  evacuated from Saudi Arabia. We're recommending quite  clearly that people don't travel there now. I mean, it  would be quite pointless for people to be travelling in

to that region, but you would appreciate that not only in  regard to Australians, but in regard to a number of  foreigners who are there in that region, a lot of them  would be involved, for instance, in the oil production  processes and it's important with the loss of the Iraq

and Kuwait production which is of the order of four  million barrels per day, that we don't have people  leaving en masse from the other Gulf producing areas, oil  producing areas, because it's important that to the  extent they can, they increase their production to make  up in part for the shortfall created by that loss of four  million barrels per day.

JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, if there was a request later for  wider military involvement,  would you think it's  necessary to take that to your full Cabinet and,

9

secondly, did you give any consideration to calling the  full Cabinet together on this matter?

PM: In answer to your first question, obviously at the  next Cabinet meeting, whether there is a request or not,  I will give a detailed report to the full Cabinet about  this matter and if the question of further involvement  did arise, we would have time to have a full Cabinet  consideration of it and that would be done. In these  circumstances, Michelle, I didn't regard it as necessary,  but I think you can see that it was a fairly  representative group of Ministers that I consulted.

JOURNALIST: In light of ... decision, Prime Minister, is  a special watch being kept on the Iraqi community in  Australia?

PM: On the?

JOURNALIST: Light of today's decision -PM: Whether ...

JOURNALIST: Is a special watch being kept on the Iraqi  community in Australia?

PM: I think that question, the answer to that question  is comprehended in something I said earlier, we would  regard our normal processes, our normal relevant  processes in Australia, to be operating appropriately and  effectively.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, what's your best assessment  now of, firstly, the likelihood of an Iraqi invasion of  Saudi Arabia and, secondly, the ability of the other oil  producing countries to crank up their production and take  up the shortfall?

PM: Alright, well, there's two separate questions there.  In regard to the first, as I say, I have been, I've had  the capacity to follow all the intelligence on this  matter and let me pay tribute to our relevant bodies here

in Australia, particularly the Office of National  Assessments which keeps up a continuous flow of  information. I mean, I pay tribute to them. They are  very effective. So relying on that and the conversations

I've had, I would think on balance that an invasion from  Saudi Arabia is unlikely, but as I said before, in answer  to a previous question, one has to understand that in  trying to analyse these situations, there's not only the  criterion of rationality and self interest assessment,  which needs to be taken into account because one would  have thought that if those had been the only criteria

that had been applied, one would have thought the  leadership of Iraq would have adhered to the promise that  it made to its Arab neighbours, to the Arab community  generally, that they wouldn't invade Kuwait because an  application of those criteria will have led to the

10

conclusion that an invasion was against the best  interests of Iraq. But to the extent that you can  therefore apply considerations of what intelligently is  the most likely course of action, my answer is I think it  not likely. Now in regard to the second - but there, is,  could I just add this, this rider. There is so much  evidence of an Iraq, a continued Iraqi presence in Kuwait  beyond what is necessary merely to hold their position,  and of a build-up of forces, additional forces still  within Iraq and on the border,  that you can't discount

the possibility for that reason. Now as to the second  question, let me say this. That, as I put to you, the  combined production in day terms of Iraq and Kuwait is of  the order of four million barrels per day. These things  need to be taken into account in looking at the likely

impact on the availability of oil and of prices. It is  the case that the world has a higher level of stocks now  than it has had for about six years and therefore there

is a capacity to run down, let's say, those stocks by a  million barrels per day for some time. If you make that  assumption then the additional production that would be  necessary from the rest of the OPEC and the non-OPEC  countries would be only to the order of three billion  barrels a day to make up the balance. The assessment is

that there is that capacity available. It will obviously  be regarded as in the interests of many of those  producers to do so. There is evidence that they are  doing it. In the pricing field you can perhaps draw some  conclusions. Prices are expressed in United States  dollars. Before the invasion the price per barrel was  just under $20US a barrel. It peaked a couple of days

ago at $30 a barrel.  It's down to $25 now. Now you  can't, just from those figures, draw any absolute  conclusion but it's not inconsistent with the proposition  I j ust put to you.

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, could I ask a question of  Admiral Beaumont through you, a technical question?

PM: Yes sure.

JOURNALIST: During the Kangaroo '89 military exercise, the Fills armed with exocet missiles ... bombing runs  against the guided missile frigates, such as the ones  we're sending. Are you able to say how often the Fills  with the exocets have been successful in killing the ...?

ADMIRAL BEAUMONT: No I'm not.

JOURNALIST: Can you confirm that that does happen?

ADMIRAL BEAUMONT:  It does happen occasionally, yes.  But  for the most part against individual ships. But these  ships would be operating as part of a task group we  believe, so there'd be a layered defence process. But  yes, it does occur.  I'm not able to say how frequently.  But suffice to say that the guided missile frigates have

11

a very competent and very capable anti-air missile system  and have very good results in our exercises.

JOURNALIST: Admiral, is that system a phalanx system?

ADMIRAL BEAUMONT: No, I'm talking about a standard.

JOURNALIST: So they're not equipped with that.

ADMIRAL BEAUMONT: They are equipped with phalanx as  well. ...

JOURNALIST: On another topic, can you tell us what the  implication will be for federal Labor with the change of  leadership in Victoria?

PM: No I can't. I don't want, obviously, to intrude  unduly in what I ’ve said consistently is the affair of  the Victorian Parliamentary Party. I would like to take  this opportunity of saying, I repeat what I said  publicly, that I respect greatly the manner in which John  cain relinquished the Premiership. Mrs Kirner's win was  a decisive one. I believe that Mr Crabb is serious in  the unqualified commitment he gave to her leadership. I  believe now that there will be a concentrated attempt by  all groups within the Victorian Labor Party to get behind  Joan Kirner and to give her all the support that she'  s  obviously going to need in this very challenging task. As far as the Commonwealth Government is concerned, we  will, within what is appropriately in our capacity, do  everything we can to assist her.

JOURNALIST: In light of the present trends can you see  Ros Kelly as the likely next Prime Minister?

PM: Well, how old will she be when I retire? She'll  have a lot of experience under her belt by then.

JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, on the September special national conference, do you see the need for more flexibility to  make decisions between meetings of the national  conference itself. Do you think it would help your  Cabinet if you did have that power?

PM: Look, I'm not going to speculate in any way which  may be unhelpful to the processes which, I can assure  you, and you know, are going on now, between now and the  special conference. There's a lot of talking going on

between a lot of people and a lot of groups to try and  get an outcome which is going to be the best for the  Party and the Government. I think that when the time  comes the Party will understand the importance of making  decisions that are in the best interests of, not just the  Party, but of the country. I have confidence that that  will be the outcome. So I don't want to say anything  more particular than that which could be unhelpful in

these very detailed processes of discussion which are  going on.

12

ÃÂ,

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, does the fact that Michael  Duffy is taking part in the opening ceremony of the new  Chinese embassy indicate a thaw in our relations with  China?

PM: No, I think that's an appropriate level. He's the  acting Foreign Minister and I think that's appropriate.  We are handling this issue I think in a sensible way, and  I don't mean just the issue of the opening of the

embassy. I mean the issue of our relations. As I made  clear, we've got to walk that, at some times difficult  line, between making sure that China understands our and  other nations' position that what happened some more than  twelve months ago is not something to be forgotten, and  at the same time on the other side try so to conduct our  relations with them in a way which will mean that China  is going to remain open to the rest of the world because  it's in no-one's interests, and least of all those within  China who want to see a reformed China and an open China,

if countries like Australia close themselves off from  them. So that's at times, as I say, a difficult line. I  think we're walking it appropriately.

JOURNALIST: Do you see any inconsistency though in  actions like Mr Duffy's and the Government's, in  particular Senator Evans', strongly repeated condemnation  of the National Party's visit to China?

PM: No.
