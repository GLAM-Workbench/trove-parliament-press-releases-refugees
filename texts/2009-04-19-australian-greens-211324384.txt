TPVs must remain buried relic of cruel Howard regime





The Greens have urged the Federal Government to reject outright the Opposition Ã¯Â¿Â½s call to reinstate  the much-criticised Temporary Protection Visas.

Opposition Leader Malcolm Turnbull told ABC radio this morning that the reintroduction of Temporary  Protection Visas  Ã¯Â¿Â½should be high on the agenda Ã¯Â¿Â½, following the arrival of boats carrying asylum  seekers in Australian waters last week.

Ã¯Â¿Â½Temporary Protection Visas should remain buried as a cruel relic of the former Howard regime, Ã¯Â¿Â½  said Greens Senator Sarah Hanson-Young.

Ã¯Â¿Â½Australia was then the only country in the world to have this kind of visa, which was actually in  contravention of our international legal obligations to refugees.

Ã¯Â¿Â½Temporary Protection Visas left genuine refugees living in limbo and fear, while attempting to build  a new life after fleeing torture and persecution.

Ã¯Â¿Â½The restrictions on family reunion breached the human rights of children.

Ã¯Â¿Â½The Greens have always opposed TPVs, as have respected humanitarian organisations such as  Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and the Refugee Council of Australia.

Ã¯Â¿Â½Even the Liberals under John Howard recognised that the TPV policy had to go and spoke about  moving away from it, before the Rudd Government did away with it altogether.

Ã¯Â¿Â½Why would we want to return to such an inhumane approach, which simply condemned the world Ã¯Â¿Â½s  most vulnerable people to an uncertain future, compounding their trauma and suffering?

Ã¯Â¿Â½The Government must reject Mr Turnbull Ã¯Â¿Â½s call for TPVs to be reintroduced, just as former  immigration minister Philip Ruddock originally rejected the idea as  Ã¯Â¿Â½highly unconscionable Ã¯Â¿Â½ when it  was suggested by Pauline Hanson back in 1998.

Ã¯Â¿Â½The Greens also reiterate the call for all asylum seekers on any future boats to be brought to the  Australian mainland for claims to be processed and checks to be carried out. Ã¯Â¿Â½
