High Court proves we need a change of  government: Greens  7th Oct 04  The High Court decision to keep kids locked up in detention proves we need a change  of government, Greens Senator Kerry Nettle said today.

Today’s unaminious decision of  the court dismissed an application by four Afghani  children, aged between seven and 15, to be released from the Baxter immigration  detention centre in South Australia who claimed they were being held there  unlawfully.

“The High Courts decision shows the only way we will get kids out of detention is a  change of government”, Senator Nettlesaid.

“There are current 86 children in detention, in breach of the Convention on the Rights  of the Child. But the High Court’s hands are tied.”

“The only way to get those kids out of detention is to change the Migration Act. To do  that we need to change the government.”

“The Greens want to see an end to mandatory detention and a return to a humane  system of processing refugee claims.”

“Only with a strong Green voice in parliament can we ensure a Latham government  implements its promise to remove children from detention while continuing to  campaign for an end to mandatory detention.”

The Greens advocate a compassionate approach to asylum seekers that arrive in  Australia. Our policy supports reception centres for health and security checks that  accommodate asylum seekers for a maximum of 14 days, before being assisted into  the community.
