Â

Call to Downer on Irian Jaya

Â

Wednesday, 8 July, 1998

Â

The Greens have called for Australia to facilitate an international 
fact finding delegation to investigate the civil strife in Irian J aya 
(West Papua).

Â

Greens Senator Bob Brown says the Howard Government 
should propose the mission when Foreign Minister Downer meets Indonesian 
President Habibie tomorrow. He has written to Mr Downer calling for 
a stronger stand on the issue. (letter attached).

Â

Irian Jaya is Australia’s nearest neighbor but despite 
a disastrous drought with thousands of deaths, military occupation by 
Indonesian troops, mass arrests and torture of political leaders, and 
an ongoing civil war against the Indonesians with more than 10000 refugees 
fleeing into Papua New Guinea, it has been a blind spot for successive 
Australian Governments.
