The Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Hon. Tony Street MP,

He deplored also Palestinian rocket attacks on northern Israel

settlements and Israeli air attacks inside Lebanon. He said that

the Australian Government was convinced that the use of force  was not the answer to provocations by either side, or acts of

terrorism, and called on all parties to return to the ceasefire

of July 1981. The Minister noted that the UN Security Council

had now unanimously adopted txvo resolutions calling for a halt

to all military activities and withdrawal of Israeli military

force forthwith and unconditionally. Mr Street said that the

Australian Government completely endorsed the Security Council's

action. .

Mr Street said that all parties, including Israel,  must avoid

actions which could only further widen the cycle of violence

in Lebanon. He said that the current fighting had already

incurred a grievous loss of life, including the deaths of -many innocent civilians. .
