Michael Keenan MP - Federal Member for  Stirling Showdown Interview with Chris Kenny April 23, 2013

Topics: Labor’s border protection failures/ Gonski Reforms

Chris Kenny

We are joined now from Perth by the Opposition Spokesperson on Customs, Justice and Border Protection, Michael  Keenan. Thanks for joining us Michael.

Michael Keenan

It is great to be with you Chris.

Chris Kenny

I will come to your portfolio areas in a minute but I just wanted to ask you first about the news of the day on the Gonski  reforms. The NSW Liberal Premier Barry O’Farrell has done a deal with Julia Gillard on this. Has he dudded Tony Abbott  by doing this deal with the Labor Government?

Michael Keenan

No. I think you would expect Premier’s to pursue what is in their states best interest and clearly that is what Premier  O’Farrell has done today. We have no expectation that they will do anything other than support what they believe is the  right thing for the future of their state. If they make the judgement that doing a deal with the Government on Gonski is in  the interest of their state then good luck to them.

Chris Kenny

But by doing the deal with Julia Gillard isn’t he endorsing her Gonski reforms? Isn’t he effectively saying, not just to the  people of NSW, but to the people of Australia that he thinks Julia Gillard’s deal for education is better than what he would  get from an Abbott Government after September?

Michael Keenan

There was clearly a large financial incentive for NSW to sign up. Other state Premier’s are certainly not as enthusiastic  about what has been offered for their states. I would cite Premier Barnett, in my home state of Western Australia, who  doesn’t think it is a particularly good deal for our state. The Premier’s as heads of government in their jurisdiction need to  make the decisions that they think are right, in the interest of their citizens and what they perceive are in the interest of  their education system.

Chris Kenny

You mentioned Colin Barnett in WA; do you think he will hold out? Or is there a chance that the Government will get all  states onboard here and actually put a national education deal together before the election?

Michael Keenan

I think that remains to be seen. I can’t speak on behalf of Colin but I do know as Premier that he has a pretty long history  of standing up for WA’s interests and I don’t doubt that he will be doing that in his conversations with the Federal  Government about this.

Chris Kenny

Well the Prime Minister seems to be happy to throw a fair bit of money around so I think she will be waving the cheque  book under his nose. Let’s have a look about what Barry O’Farrell said about this earlier today.

Well as you say Michael Keenan the Premier of NSW saying he is acting in the interests of his state but of course he has  done a previous deal with the NDIS. He was the first Premier to jump onboard with that. He seems to be developing a very good working relationship with Julia Gillard. How well does he get on with Tony Abbott?

Michael Keenan

I am not familiar with the ins and outs of their relationship but I think they both get on very well. They are both NSW  Liberals, they would have a lot to do with each other. He is the head of government in NSW and he obviously needs to  deal with the Federal Government in Canberra as it has been elected by the Australian people. I think everyone would  expect him to get on with the business in the way that he has and in the way that he sees fit for his own state.

Chris Kenny

Ok we will move on to your portfolio area now in particular border protection. Border Protection is a bad issue for the  Government as they have not been able to stop the boats as they said they would do and of course the Tony Abbott line  of “stop the boats” is well known around the country. It is certainly an electoral plus for the Opposition. If that’s the case  and we all know that, why do you need to be so heavy handed about it? Why do you need to go out and put up billboards  referring to illegals and the like?

Michael Keenan

I don’t see that as a heavy handed approach. Obviously we are prosecuting our case for the way we think that we can  govern Australia in a significantly better way than the incompetence that has been shown by the Labor Party for the last  five and a half years.

Chris Kenny

But we know that the Coalition are promising tougher measures, very similar to what the Howard Government had in  place, and that we know were successful. We know that and we see on the news that boats are still arriving. Is there any  need to inflame the situation by putting up this billboard and referring to ‘illegal arrivals’ which starts up a debate that  people find uncomfortable, that seems to demonise, or can in the eyes of some people demonise the asylum seekers  themselves?

Michael Keenan

We don’t demonise people seeking asylum here. We do demonise and we do target people smugglers. That is the whole  point of the policies that we want to take to the Australian people to secure our borders. It is not about the people on the  boats it is about the manner in which they arrive and the fact that they have contracted organised criminal syndicates to  come to Australia in this way. We cannot accept this continuing and that is why we do make the point that we will do  better. I might say that when Julia Gillard knifed Kevin Rudd for the Prime Ministership, his failure to secure our borders  was on of the three reasons that she cited that she needed to do that. Clearly it is a significant issue and I think the  Australian people are right to expect that the Commonwealth can do a lot better and we will if we get a chance to govern.

Chris Kenny

So why the need to go to Geraldton today? We know that a boat arrived on the mainland in Geraldton harbour nearly a  fortnight ago. Why the need to deliberately highlight that particular arrival?

Michael Keenan

It was a pretty shocking circumstance that a boat will sail within 200m of Geraldton harbour undetected by Australia  authorities. We have asked the Government for some details about how this was able to occur and so far they have  refused to give us a briefing.

Chris Kenny

I will just interrupt you there Michael Keenan. Obviously you have been experienced in his area for quite some time. Isn’t it  the case that we would never be able to stop boats from getting to the mainland under any regime because most of the

asylum boats that are so called intercepted now are actually seeking out the Australia Customs vessels and the Australian  Navy vessels. They go to Ashmore Reef or Christmas Island looking to be intercepted and even ring up and ask boats to  come pick them up. You couldn’t really effectively corner off that whole north western coastline?

Michael Keenan

We can if we reduce the incentive for people smugglers to operate. What we will do is destroy the people smugglers  business model. So it won’t just mean stopping boats from coming to mainland Australia, it will mean stopping boats going  to Christmas Island, Ashmore Reef and Cocos Island.

Chris Kenny

That’s the point isn’t it? It is about reducing those pull factors? It is not actually about having some kind of Navy blockade  across the waters intercepting boats. That is never going to work. It is about the pull factors?

Michael Keenan

That is exactly right. The absolute heart of this problem is changing the policy in Canberra that is causing Australia to be  an enormous magnate pulling people in literally from all over the world. You are exactly right but we will still need to  maintain a presence on our borders. Obviously not just for intercepting asylum seekers but all the other sorts of things that  a sovereign country needs to do to protect its sovereignty.

Chris Kenny

Now despite the success of the Howard Government regime and the fact that some boats were turned back and all the  experts say that it was quite a decisive factor in why the boats were stopped last time. But the Labor Party is very keen to  resist that. They don’t want to say that they will attempt to turn back boats in any circumstances. I will just show you firstly  what the Trade Minister, Craig Emerson, had to say on that earlier today.

(Audio)

Now we go around in circles on this issue. The Government keeps saying that you can’t do this as it will offend Indonesia  and I know that Indonesia is never going to welcome this policy but it is the case that it has happened before and  therefore could happen again. Michael Keenan the point though is simply that you have to be prepared to say that if in  government you have that opportunity to turn back boats that you are willing to put up with tension in the relationship with  Indonesia, if that is the result. You are willing to pay a diplomatic price if necessary?

Michael Keenan

I think we will have a very good working relationship with Indonesia as we did under the previous government. I don’t think  we need to apologise for standing up for Australia’s interests. It is in our interests to close down people smuggling. It is  also in Indonesia’s interest that we close down people smuggling as well. There is a lot of tension with our relationship  with Indonesia at the moment because of the dumb decisions that have been taken by Rudd and Gillard Governments,  particularly on the live export debacle. They are very concerned about other things that have happened within that  relationship. What we will do is fix Australia’s domestic policy that is encouraging people smuggling. We will then speak to  the Indonesians from a position of strength and set out why we think it is important to follow the policy prescription of  turning the boats back around and I am sure we will come to a working arrangement with them.

Chris Kenny

That will be an interesting situation to watch develop, if indeed it does. Thank you for joining us tonight from Perth,  Michael Keenan.

Michael Keenan

My pleasure Chris.
