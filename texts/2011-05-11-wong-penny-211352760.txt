TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW - ABC 891 BREAKFAST WITH MATTHEW ABRAHAM  AND DAVID BEVAN

SUBJECT:  BUDGET 2010-2011.

E  & O E - PROOF ONLY

JOURNALIST: Senator Penny Wong joins us now. Good morning to you Senator.

WONG: Good morning, how are you both?

JOURNALIST: Well how are you? I’ve just seen you on national television, I think on  Sunrise, sitting in an open tent on a -

WONG: It’s freezing.

JOURNALIST: On the lawns of Parliament House in Canberra.

WONG: I called it extreme interviewing. Did you see that the light nearly fell on us all too  because of the wind?

JOURNALIST: That’s gutsy stuff.

WONG: Yes, well it was pretty chilly. I feel sorry for the poor old journalists; they’ve been  out there for hours.

JOURNALIST: Oh no don’t feel sorry for journalists, no one else does.

WONG: (laughs) OK I won’t.

JOURNALIST: No one else does.

JOURNALIST: Senator Penny Wong, Finance Minister and South Australian Labor Party  Senator. A very senior player in the Federal Government. And obviously somebody very  much involved in framing this budget with Wayne Swan. It’s been almost universally  dismissed as a budget that talks tough, but isn’t really tough. What’s your view?

WONG: There are plenty of tough decisions in this budget, some $22 billion of them. And  I’ve seen a fair few responses from the Opposition criticising those tough decisions. But  that’s what you need to do to come back to surplus.

It’s a budget which is a very Labor budget, focused on jobs, on opportunity, on getting more  people into work, on training people and on creating jobs.

JOURNALIST: There are $21.7 billion worth of savings over four years, is that correct?

WONG: Just under $22 billion, that’s right.

JOURNALIST: Right and that’s over four years?

WONG: That’s right.

JOURNALIST: Is that offset by $18.9 billion in new spending?

WONG: No that figure’s not quite right. The net save position is about five and a bit billion  dollars, because the spending includes some spending for which we’d already provisioned.  There’s a thing called the contingency reserve and spending had already been booked  against that. So the net save position is about $5 billion. But I think the -

JOURNALIST: That starts to sound less impressive does it not?

JOURNALIST: On your figures it’s five and a bit billion over four years?

WONG: Well hang on, the Budget comes back to black. We come back to surplus in 2012-13, as we said we would. We reduce the deficits and we come back to surplus. And we do it  not just by savings cuts, but we also do it by a lot of spending restraint. And can I just give  you -

JOURNALIST: But -

WONG: Can I just give you this one figure -

JOURNALIST: No well Minister, Minister if we could -

WONG: Because this is important, this is an important -

JOURNALIST: Just clear this up though -

WONG: Well this is an important figure -

JOURNALIST: Minister, well let’s work with the figures we’ve got so far. That is you’re  making savings over four years of just under $22 billion. You are increasing spending in  other areas, so on your figures your net saving is about five and a bit billion over four  years?

WONG: And the point I was trying to make was that there’s also an enormous amount of  spending restraint. And the figure I wanted to give you was this one. Over the course of this  budget, the average real growth in expenditure over the forward estimates - over the budget  period - is about 1 per cent a year. In fact in one year, there is a reduction in spending.

You know the last time that sort of restraint was achieved was in the 1980s. That’s the last  time. In the 1980s was the last time a Federal Government achieved that sort of spending  restraint. So we are coming back to surplus after an enormous hit on revenue from the  floods, from the cyclones, from the overhang of the GFC, and of course a very cautious  consumer and a high dollar. We’ve had to write down revenue by about over $16 billion  over the first couple of years that we’ve been putting this budget together.

JOURNALIST: Now is it correct Penny Wong that of that $5 billion, $5.1 billion over four  years, $1.7 billion is going to be spent on the asylum seeker solution?

WONG: There is an increase in the management of detention of asylum seekers. Just as  this was expensive under the Howard Government, this is also an expense under our  Government, and we -

JOURNALIST: But over four years, almost half your savings effort - net savings effort, is  going to be spent on the asylum solution.

WONG: What I’ve said is that there are obviously expenses associated with maintaining a  system of detention. It is an expensive thing. But it’s the right policy setting and it’s -

JOURNALIST: So voters who are losing what is allegedly middle-class welfare, to use I  think maybe some commentators' view, it almost exactly matches the cuts in so-called  middle-class welfare including to kids’ savings, taking money from kids’ piggy banks.

WONG: Oh come on.

JOURNALIST: Almost exactly matches what it’s going to cost you to fix the asylum  problem.

WONG: Alright, there’s a few things there I’d like to respond to. The kids’ piggy bank thing  really, even for you Matt, is a bit over the top. You know what we’re doing? We’re saying  the tax break we give low income earners - that is people who are on low incomes, under  $30,000 a year - we have increased tax benefits, tax breaks to them so people keep more  of every dollar they earn. It’s called the Low Income Tax Offset.

What we’re saying is if your parents are wealthy, you don’t get access to that for income  you haven’t earned - that is, for income where your parents just allocate that to you as part  of the tax return. We’re saying in that year, it’s not fair that a Low Income Tax Offset that’s  about trying to reward low income people for doing work, that shouldn’t be given as a tax  break where you haven’t earned that income or it’s simply been allocated because your  parents are wealthy. So I think the piggy bank thing is a little unfair.

When it comes to asylum seekers, this is a policy that costs money, just as it did under  John Howard. And we have to make room for that in the budget. Just as, and more  importantly - we made room for the mental health package which is a very important  initiative, $2.2 billion to deal with a group of people in our society who we know desperately  need more services.

JOURNALIST: Alright. Now we know you’re pushed for time Senator Penny Wong.

JOURNALIST: Let’s go to Elizabeth from the Hills. Hello Elizabeth.

CALLER: Good morning. I’m confused because there is a $50 billion deficit this year, $20  billion next year. Is this residual debt? Does that mean that - what I have heard is that there  will be a debt of $100 billion by the end of three years. Where does this money come from  to pay that debt back? Or are we just paying interest on it?

JOURNALIST: Senator Penny Wong?

WONG: Well first, in terms of the deficits, the deficit particularly in 2010-11 is entirely as a  result of how much money Government receives being massively downgraded.

So when we looked at what Treasury and the Department of Finance thought that  Government would receive in terms of tax revenue six months ago, for a whole range of  reasons which include the fact that we have a very high dollar and that’s having an effect on  company profits, we’ve seen some $16 billion less predicted to come to Government this  year and next year. So that’s the reason for those deficits.

But in terms of debt, can I just give you a bit of a feel for it. Our net debt peaks at about 7.2   per cent of GDP. That is of the size of our economy next year, in 2011-12, 7.2 per cent. The  peak net debt for major advanced economies on average peaks at 91 per cent of GDP. So  we’re at 7.2 per cent even at our most - at our highest net debt level. And the average of  most major advanced economies is 91 per cent. So you know, we’re less than one tenth of  the peak debt.

JOURNALIST: But just to answer Elizabeth’s questions, do those deficits just go on the  debt?

WONG: The deficits do have to be funded by Government.

JOURNALIST: So she’s right. So it’ll end up what, being $100 odd billion?

WONG: Well the Government has what we call a Commonwealth Government Securities  Program. And that debt is issued by the Office of -

JOURNALIST: Minister, how much is the debt?

WONG: The net debt, which is the right assessment peaks at 7.2 per cent of - .

JOURNALIST: No, no, no not in a percentage term, but in dollars.

WONG: Well the -

JOURNALIST: That’s what Elizabeth was asking you.

WONG: Net debt would be about $106 billion at its highest next year.

JOURNALIST: So she’s right.

WONG: And what I’d say to her -

JOURNALIST: It took a long time to say you’re right Elizabeth.

WONG: But I think it’s important to get the figures clear, because we can talk a lot about  debt and we do, which is why we’ve made decisions to bring the budget back to surplus by  2012-13. But I think it’s also important to remember where we are compared to the rest of  the world. We’re at 7.2 per cent of the size of our economy. They’re, on average, major  advanced economies - 91 per cent. So we are you know, a long way ahead.

JOURNALIST: Now Senator Penny Wong, just finally - Finance Minister and South  Australian Labor Senator - has the Government of which you’re a member, and this  includes the Rudd Government, ever met its budget forecasts?

WONG: You will remember there was a thing called the global financial crisis. And whilst  some people in the Liberal Party like to pretend that didn’t happen, I think Australians know  it did. And they certainly can see how that affected countries like the UK, countries like the  US, other parts of Europe.

How we have been fortunate enough as a nation to come through that well. But that has an  enormous effect on our revenues. And no country saw that coming. There would be no  minister of finance anywhere in the world that could say to you we saw that coming and we  adjusted our budget figures ahead of time.

JOURNALIST: Senator Penny Wong thank you for talking to 891 ABC Adelaide Breakfast.

WONG: Good to speak with you all.
