Manus Island crisis re-escalates

The federal government's neglect of refugees and people seeking asylum on Manus Island has led to a re-escalation of tension and danger, Greens Immigration Spokesperson Nick McKim says.

"For the last few days access to two facilities where more than 250 refugees and people seeking asylum are living has been blocked by the landowners who are in dispute with the PNG Immigration department and contractors," Senator McKim said.



"The refugees and people seeking asylum are trapped. They are effectively being held hostage even though the landowners’ dispute is not with them."

"The situation is close to a flashpoint. It is chaotic and unpredictable, and the refugees and people seeking asylum who remain Australia’s responsibility are in significant danger."

"Responsibility for this crisis rests with Peter Dutton and Malcom Turnbull for ordering the closure of the Australia’s Manus Island prison when safe alternative facilities were not ready, and with the ALP which has backed them up every step of the way."

"The only safe and durable solution is to bring the refugees and people seeking asylum in Papua New Guinea here to safety in Australia."
