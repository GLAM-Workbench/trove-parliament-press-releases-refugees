CHRISTMAS MESSAGE

(By the Acting Prime Minister and Leader of the National Country  Party of Australia, the Rt Hon. J.D. Anthony, M.P.)

For Australians ahd for -people of many languages and  cultures around the world, Christmas is a day of great importance

It is a celebration, a day for enjoyment and friendship,  and I hope that all Australian enjoy a very happy Christmas  day with their families and friends.

At the same time, I hope that we do not lose sight of the  fact that many people, for one reason or another, will not be  able to share in this happiness.

We are a fortunate nation,-  and not only in material terms.

During 1981 we have been sharply reminded of our good  fortune in living in a country that, whatever its faults,   offers security, stability and opportunity.to all its people.

Above all, we have been .reminded that we live in a country  at peace wrth its neighbours, a free country, whose people can  and do decide the course of their own.lives, who choose their  own governments, and who resolve differences between themselves  by just and peaceful means.

We value'these gifts of peace-and freedom above all. others,  and we are properly concerned if they are threatened or denied  anywhere in the world. .

The,crisis i n ;Poland is therefore a matter of grave  concern for all Australians.

It is a crisis with the most serious implications, not  only for the reforms achieved in Poland in the last 17 months,  but for overall international stability.

This Christmas, I hope the thoughts of the people of  Australia will be with the people of Poland.

-  We all wish, I believe, that they can maintain the reforms  they have won, that there can be an early return to civil and  trade union liberties, and that Poles can find their own solution  to their difficulties without further bloodshed.  (

The prayer for peace on earth is as old as Christmas itself.  It is one needed now as much as ever.
