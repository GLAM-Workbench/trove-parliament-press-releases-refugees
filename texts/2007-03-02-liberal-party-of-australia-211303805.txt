Labor put out the welcome mat for people smugglers

'l'oday the Labor Party have again shown themselves to be soft on border protection  by committing to close the detention centre at Nauru.

A Rudd Labor Government will put out the welcome mat for people smugglers who  seek to profit from packing humans like sardines into unseaworthy boats.

This irresponsible policy would inevitably result in a flood of vessels heading to  Australia

The strong border protection policies of the Howard Government have significantly  reduced the number of boats attempting to sail to Australia.

As a result of our successful border protection policies, Australia is able to commit to  resettling 13,000 people each year that the UNHCR identify as in need of refugee and  humanitarian aid.

Only the Howard Government will keep Australia's borders secure.
