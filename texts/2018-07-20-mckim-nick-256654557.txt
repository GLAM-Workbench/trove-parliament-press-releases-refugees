Turnbull and Tudge should stop dividing

The Turnbull Government should stop punishing and demonising migrants if it wants to help people settle in Australia, Greens Immigration and Citizenship spokesperson Nick McKim says.

“Turnbull, Tudge and Dutton should put their money where their mouths are if they want to help migrants settle in Australia,” Senator McKim said.

“They have cut support for asylum seekers, tried to make citizenship more difficult, and consistently embraced the hateful agenda of One Nation.”

“They tried to water down protections against racist hate speech, and are in the middle of a racist campaign against African-Australians.”

“Instead of all this, they should be funding programs that help people to settle in Australia, and make them feel welcome in our community.”

“But above all they should cut the racist crap.”
