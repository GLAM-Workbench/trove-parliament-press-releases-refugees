War will create more Australian veterans & 
a responsibility to hel  p Iraqi refugees in Australia

Â

Australia’s commitment to any future war 
on Iraq will have many long term costs including rebuilding Iraq, repairing 
relationships in our region and caring for a new generation of veterans 
and their families, according to the   Australian Democrats.

Â

“If the Government insists on participating in a 
war against Iraq, Australia will have an obligation to assist in rebuilding 
the nation, assisting the victims and giving asylum to refugees,” 
Senator Andrew Bartlett, the Leader of the Australian Democrats, said 
today.

Â

“Rather than sending Afghanistan and Iraqi refugees 
back to the region, the Government should offer them permanent asylum 
and the chance to build new lives in Australia,” said Senator Bartlett.

Â

“The suicide last week of a refugee in Australia 
on a temporary protection visa highlights the desperate situation facing 
those seeking asylum in Australia.Â Â  The number of young people 
becoming psychiatrically ill due to the Government’s policy rises 
daily.”

Â

Senator Bartlett rejected the Prime Minister’s recent 
comments that war against Iraq could allow Australia to return more 
asylum seekers.

Â

“It is ridiculous to think that asylum seekers should 
be returned to a post war country, whether it is Afghanistan or Iraq,” 
said Senator Bartlett.

Â

“The Australian Democrats call on the Government 
to grant permanent protection to Iraqi and Afghanistan people presently 
on temporary refugee visas, and allow immediate family reunion rights.

Â

“Australia cannot claim that people who flee Iraq 
do not deserve protection at the same time as using human rights abuses 
in Iraq as one reason for sanctioning war.

Â

“Kurds and Iraqis are already seeking asylum across 
the world. If war begins, the UN estimates that numbers will soar to 
1.4 million refugees, with 900,000 crossing the border and an additional 
500,000 people trapped in Iraq itself.Â  Neighbouring countries 
are indicating they will close their borders. The scale of human disaster 
cannot be underestimated.

Â

“It is the families in Iraq and the families of defence personnel 
that bear the greatest cost of war.

Â

“There will be costs in caring for a new generation of veterans 
and their families. Australia has outstanding debts to the veteran community 
since World War II, and the health study of ou r 1991 Iraq veterans 
is still to be released,” concluded Senator Bartlett.Â
