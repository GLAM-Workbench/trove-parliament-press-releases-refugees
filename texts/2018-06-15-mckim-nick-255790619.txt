Media Release: Death on Nauru

June 15, 2018

The death of person who sought asylum in Australia but was exiled offshore for five years is a another bloody stain on  Australia’s national conscience, Greens Immigration spokesperson Nick McKim says.

“This is yet another life lost due to our country's cruel and inhumane refugee policies," Senator McKim said.

"This tragedy was entirely predictable, yet the Liberals and ALP remain in cruel policy lockstep.”

“Australia’s offshore detention system has been a humanitarian calamity and one of the darkest chapters in our  country’s story.”

“How many more lives need to be lost? How many more shattered hopes and dreams? How many more days of lost  hope and yearning for freedom?”

“This is an emergency. Australia’s detention centres on Manus island and Nauru must be evacuated and every  woman, man and child immediately brought to Australia so we can try to help them rebuild their lives.”
