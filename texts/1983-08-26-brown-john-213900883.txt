JOHN BROWN MPMINISTER FOR ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICESMINISTER ASSISTING THE MINISTER FOR INDUSTRY AND COMMERCE\l+SHORT TERM LEASING OF UNITS AT FAIRY MEADOW MIGRANT CENTRE, NSWThe Minister for Administrative Services,  the Hon. John Brown. MP,  announced today that following discussions with the Minister for  Immigration and Ethnic Affairs the Hon.  Stewart West MP, areas  of the Migrant Centre at Fairy Meadow would be mad.e  available  for short term leasing by community, charitable,  sporting and  similar bodies . Expressions of interest would be invited through the media in  the Illawarra Region on Saturday, 27 August 1983. Mr Brown said that consideration had been given for some time by  departmental officers as to how best to use the facilities  following the closure of the units at the Centre in late 1982.  English classes, information programs and other settlement  assistance continued to be provided at Fairy Meadow by the Â·  Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. It was recently agreed that the residential units could be made  available for use by community organisations. "The facilities would only be offered for short term leasing .  because the need could arise at very, short notice to accommodate  refugees,  victims of natural disasters, etc," he said. "Although several groups have already expressed an interest in  using the Centre,.  I want to be sure that its availability is  made known to a wide audience.  Details of terms and conditions  will .  be available from the Sydney office of my Department." Mr Brown added that the Commonwealth was anxious to see that  this valuable asset was put to good use and for this reason  a decision on likely users would be made fairly quickly. 26 August 1983  .
