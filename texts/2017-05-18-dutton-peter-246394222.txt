RAY HADLEY:

Every Thursday we try to talk to the Immigration Minister Peter Dutton and the  Minister's on the line from Brisbane this morning. Minister, good morning.

PETER DUTTON:

Good morning, Ray.

RAY HADLEY:

Well, well, well, they're coming after you, the Admin Appeals Tribunal, you've been a  naughty boy, you're in trouble with the Law Council of Australia. Have you lost sleep  over that?

PETER DUTTON:

No, I think if you tell the truth you should sleep well at night and I think people, when  they have a look at some of these cases that are being decided by the AAT or in  some of the courts, people who believe that they're above the law, above scrutiny by  the public; I think should be the ones that shouldn't rest too well at night. If people  are deciding matters and they aren't meeting community expectations then I don't  see why people shouldn't face scrutiny over that.

RAY HADLEY:

Okay. Well it's almost side-splittingly funny that the Law Council President - whom I  don't know - Fiona McLeod should say; Tribunal members reviewed government  decisions in accordance with law, not personal preference or ideology.

She must be on another planet given - and I'm not talking about just this tribunal the  AAT, I'm talking about magistrates, judges of all persuasions - if she thinks that  they're background…maybe she needs to have a good long look Immigration  Minister at the Magistrate's Court at Southport to see exactly what the Labor-appointed magistrates do in that court among many courts across the country.

PETER DUTTON:

Or in Petrie Ray, I mean it's not that long ago we were talking about the Grand  Magistrate at Petrie who had presided over the matter where university students  climbed up on to my roof of the Electorate Office; the police and fire brigade had to  bring her down and, as your listeners will recall from the time that this case was  heard in his decision, the learned Magistrate said that had it been his daughter he  would have been proud of the fact that she was up on the roof.

Now, I don't think that's written in any criminal code or any statute anywhere, that  approach. I think for people to believe that magistrates or judges or tribunal  members don't bring their own personal views to matters is a nonsense and it's  embarrassing that somebody would make such a statement, but anyway, that's for  them to answer.

From my perspective I'm going to continue to do what I think is the right thing and  that is cancel visas where people don't have a legitimate claim to be here or they've  committed criminal offences and I just can't abide the Australian people or taxpayers  being taken for mugs and I think in some of these cases clearly that has happened.

RAY HADLEY:

Now I saw your comments on Sky News and I know you spoke earlier this week with  Alan suggesting only half of the detainees on Manus Island have been found to be  genuine refugees - and I note that you said obviously they won't be going to the  USA because they're not genuine refugees - but you suggested that perhaps they'll  be the problem for the PNG Government, not the Australian Government. Is that still  the case?

PETER DUTTON:

Well under the deal that was struck by Kevin Rudd and Prime Minister O'Neill - and  Labor's got a short memory on this; I mean Bill Shorten's all critical, but he was  sitting around the Cabinet table when these boats were arriving in great number -  and the deal struck between Mr Rudd and Mr O'Neill meant that if people were found  to be refugees, then they would settle in PNG and we operate under the same  arrangements, the same deal that was struck by Labor at the time; so that is the  arrangement.

Now, for a lot of refugees we're hoping that they will be eligible for the arrangement  to go to the United States, but that's up to the US, they'll decide who goes to their  country, rightly, and there will be some who have been found not to be refugees -  they're economic migrants essentially, not refugees by any stretch of the imagination  - they have to go back home, they have to go back to their country of origin because

as we spoke about this week Ray, we've spent $13.7 billion on cleaning this mess up  of the 50,000 who arrived on boats since 2007-08 - $13.7 billion.

There are pensioners across the country who can't afford to turn on heating this  winter and yet we're spending almost $14 billion on cleaning up this mess - and I  believe very strongly, given the state that Bill Shorten's in with his Left wing of his  party, that if they're re-elected the boats would restart and we would be back to  square one. This nightmare would be relived.

RAY HADLEY:

Speaking of such matters; there was an attack in Sydney's west this week. On  Tuesday a 37 year-old, Wol Kuac Wol Wol was charged after allegedly groping three  women and damaging a bus. I heard on one report he's a Sudanese refugee. Are  you aware of Wol Kuac Wol Wol?

PETER DUTTON:

I'm not aware of the particular case, but we do get referrals from police agencies,  we’ve been working with the police very closely to identify people who are non-citizens who commit crimes and if it's within the law, then we can cancel their visas.

Victoria had a particular problem with the Sudanese - we discussed that before - we've cancelled six visas down there for people that have been involved in Apex  gangs; we're having a look at another seven at the moment.

So that work across each state, each jurisdiction goes on every day and the police  do a great job with our officers from the Australian Border Force as well. So there's  no shortage of work unfortunately.

RAY HADLEY:

Now, just on a matter which we haven't addressed: the announcement by the Prime  Minister on 457 visa holders and the changes that will be introduced. I had a well  written note from the Managing Partner of Blenheim Partners, Mr Gregory Robinson.  He says we're leading the way in seeking amendments to the Government's  announced policy initiatives to the 457 visa, in particular potential for loss of  opportunity for the country and impact on capability, diversity, innovation and so it  goes on.

Now, they're an organisation that deal with executives and they make the point that  really high-powered executives who might be coming to the country because they  have special skills, won't come under the new arrangements.

Now, I'll talk about that in detail with you at another time, but I've also been  approached via email and phone call by a lot of restaurateurs - and I'm not talking  about the big end of town, I'm not talking about the fancy ones on wharves, on  harbours - I'm talking about the suburbs of Sydney and Brisbane where they might  have an Italian restaurant and they have a chef coming out here to work and if it

works out, he wants to become a citizen - he might be from Italy, obviously, or from  Greece if it's a Greek restaurant or the like.

They say that things are going to be made so much harder for them. Is there any  thought of any dispensation to some industries in relation to 457 visa holders?

PETER DUTTON:

Well Ray we've tried to strike a common sense balance here. So I think there is a  cultural issue here where we've got young Australians who can be trained up to work  in restaurants or fast food outlets or whatever else. I mean the expectation is that  they have to work and the welfare system, you know, we've tightened it up in the  Budget, but people would say that young people living a passive life on welfare, that  somehow that's an acceptable way to live your life, it's not. People have worked hard  all of their lives and paid taxes and the expectation is that young people who are of  working age, have a capacity to work, should work.

Now, if there are particular circumstances where in regional areas they can't find  workers or they can't get local people to work there because there's low youth  unemployment or whatever, then there are circumstances that we can look at  individually and see what we can do.

RAY HADLEY:



Yeah okay, I take that, but Peter you're not going to train blokes to cook pizza and  pasta in a couple of years. I mean you're talking about young people and you and I  both know the most productive immigrants we've ever had in this country are the  ones that came here after the war from Europe - be it Italy, from Greece, from Malta,  and all the other nations that came here - I mean these are the lifters not the leaners  these people; they're working.

PETER DUTTON:

Ray, I guess the point here is that there are circumstances where workers can be  brought in where they can't find an Australian worker to fill that job and we haven't, in  abolishing the 457 programme…it's not as if we've put an end to the ability for  employers to bring foreign workers in. If they can demonstrate that there's not  somebody available to fill that job locally, so they need to go through market testing  - which they didn't before - that is, that they need to properly advertise the job and  find somebody - and there may be a migrant that's been here a long time who's  willing to fill that position in the Italian restaurant, for example and there may not be -  and in that circumstance we can work with that company, but there are a couple of  cases that have been in the media in the last week where I've asked the Department  to go and have a look at and it turns out that they're just factually incorrect; that  either the person hadn't applied for a visa or there was another visa category that  they could have applied under. So we've just tightened it up dramatically, but as I  say, it's a common sense approach.

We don't want to see businesses close, we want to support businesses, help them  grow, employ more young Australians, but there are some businesses you look at

where you think; well I'm pretty sure that we could train up young Australians or help  support Australians - in this Budget we put a billion and a half dollars together to  train about 300,000 apprentices and I don't want those kids being displaced from  work.

So it is just a question of trying to get the balance right, but again we can have a look  at individual cases and see what might suit them, but the default position should be  to employ an Australian.

RAY HADLEY:

Okay. Appreciate your time. Look, there's breaking news here I'm just reading from  the screen, the Australian Federal Police says the ATO officer arrested is Michael  Cranston, the father of Adam Cranston. He's been arrested earlier today and he's  been charged…the ATO official, this is the Deputy Commissioner, Minister,  according to Sky News reporting right now, he's been charged as part of a tax fraud  investigation. Crikey.

PETER DUTTON:

Well my understanding Ray is that the Police Commissioner Andrew Colvin will have  something to say or the Federal Police will have something to say at the appropriate  time, but obviously it's a serious investigation and it shows the good work that the  Federal Police and the other agencies do on a daily basis. So I think there'll be more  information available soon enough.

RAY HADLEY:

It's one thing for the son of the Deputy Commissioner to be arrested, it's another  thing for a Deputy Commissioner to be charged.

PETER DUTTON:

Well Ray, I mean without commenting on that case, again, obviously it's a sensitive  issue, but none of us are above the law; not Ministers, not public officials and not  judges, not magistrates, everybody in our society is equal, they abide by the law  equally and obviously, ultimately, we're answerable to the people.

RAY HADLEY:

Okay. Appreciate your time, we'll talk next week if possible.

PETER DUTTON:

Thanks Ray. See you, mate.

RAY HADLEY:

That's Peter Dutton, the Immigration Minister on the line from Brisbane.
