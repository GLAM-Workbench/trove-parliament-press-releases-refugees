RAY HADLEY:

Mr Abbott, g’day.

TONY ABBOTT:

G’day, Ray.

RAY HADLEY:

Nice to talk to you. Geez, you’ve had a month.

TONY ABBOTT:

It’s been busy and ultimately it’s been disappointing but, yeah, it’s certainly been an honour to lead the  Coalition through a tumultuous election campaign.

RAY HADLEY:

Well it’s part of history, political history in any case, for both you and the Prime Minister and for your  parties and it basically had the nation on the edge of their seat for that entire period.

TONY ABBOTT:

It wasn’t dull. Whatever else it was, it wasn’t dull, Ray, and, yes, only twice in a hundred years has a first  term government lost its majority and in this case we had a chaotic and incompetent government before the  election and I suspect it’s just going to get worse in the months ahead.

RAY HADLEY:

What, from a personal viewpoint is worse? Getting beaten by a dozen seats or waiting for the last vote to fall  with Rob Oakeshott keeping us on the edge of our seats collectively for 17 minutes? What’s worse, going so  tantalisingly close or just being beaten?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, to use the football analogy, it’s always disappointing to lose the grand final but it’s better to play a  really good game and lose by a point than to get walloped, so you don’t want to be the Dragons in 1975.

RAY HADLEY:

With poor old Changa in the white boots…

TONY ABBOTT:

…in the white boots, that none of us have forgotten!

RAY HADLEY:

We’re still talking about in 2010! I noticed when Changa was there recently at the SCG he wore pair of  white sandshoes to celebrate things so he hasn’t lost his sense of humour, either. Well, we’ve got a whole  range of things to cover. Look, I broadcast into the seat of Lyne and the people up there are absolutely, well,  they’re filthy; they’re cranky. They in some respects think they’ve been duped and then all of a sudden Mr  Oakeshott throws another spanner in the works today by saying that he’s asking Tony Windsor to support  his attempt to be the Speaker of the lower house. That’s unprecedented, well it’s not unprecedented, but it’s  almost unprecedented.

TONY ABBOTT:

Yeah, look, Rob is a good guy. I like him. He’s a very decent bloke and I’m very disappointed with his  decision as I am the decision of Tony Windsor but I respect their right to make that decision and in the end,  this is going to be a matter between Rob and his electors. As for the Speakership, well, I was thinking that  the best thing we could do would be to move towards a Westminster-style Speakership where once a  Speaker is selected, he or she continues to serve at the pleasure of the Parliament but without a party  political role and Harry Jenkins, who actually did a pretty good job in the chair in the last Parliament, I think  would be the ideal candidate to start a Westminster-style Speakership in this country. Now, if Rob puts his  hand up, obviously we’ll give him a fair consideration but we’ll have to see who else puts their hand up.

RAY HADLEY:

One of the things among many I’ve received this morning, and I’ll throw this one up to you, this is from the  website, ‘since Rob Oakeshott proclaims to be independent he would need on every division to decide which  side he supported, the Coalition or Labor, and then get a person from the other side to pair with him. Let’s  say the Government proposes some bill which the Opposition doesn’t support and Oakeshott also doesn’t  support, there would be in the Chamber 75 people in support of the Bill, assuming the other independents  and Green went that way, and 74 plus Oakeshott against, that’d come down to 74 apiece but of course he  gets the casting vote’. So he’s all powerful.

TONY ABBOTT:

Yeah look, we’re in uncharted waters here, Ray, and I guess it’s hard to know how this new system is going  to pan out. Perhaps one of the reasons why Rob wants to be considered for Speaker is because he wants to  take himself out of having to make a decision on legislation on a day-to-day basis, maybe that’s one of the  reasons why he wants this job.

RAY HADLEY:

In the email, they also say that they’ve checked other countries that have a Westminster system of  government. In all cases, the Speaker is not paired, he or she doesn’t vote but does have the casting vote. So,  they don’t impact on the first vote, but if they’re required, they cast later.

TONY ABBOTT:

That’s right. So, I suspect that one of the attractions of the Speakership for an independent is that it stops the  independent from needing to consider every bit of legislation on its merits because it’s not common for  votes to be tied and the Speaker to then have to make a casting vote.

RAY HADLEY:

And that’s why the Prime Minister is seeking legal advice as we speak, no doubt.

TONY ABBOTT:

I suspect that’s right. I mean, look, you would think that the simplest thing would be for the incumbent  Speaker to continue in the role but hopefully to continue in the role in a much less partisan way than has  traditionally been the case in Canberra.

RAY HADLEY:

When we spoke well before the election was called, I indicated to you I thought that asylum seekers was a  really important part of the process and as it turned out, it did capture the hearts and minds of the electorate.  A story today in the Telegraph by Simon Benson, and this furphy is always thrown up to me by various  people from the Government, ‘oh look, you whinge about the illegal boat people, there are many more  arriving here legally by plane who are then seeking to be refugees’. Well the figures that have been tossed  up by Simon Benson fly in the face of that, 6,310 illegally as opposed to 5,646 applying for onshore  protection visas once they’re here legally by air with their passport.

TONY ABBOTT:

That’s right.

RAY HADLEY:

It continued to be a problem, we’re overcrowded, we had a promise from the Prime Minister before the  election she’d solve it by the East Timor solution, but we’re no closer to that than we were on the day she  announced it.

TONY ABBOTT:

Absolutely right, and, look, there’s never going to be an East Timor processing centre because the East  Timorese don’t want it, the Indonesians are against it and Kevin Rudd doesn’t believe in it. So, this is just a

4

bit of pre-election myth making and, frankly, it’s disappointing that the Prime Minister has half gotten away  with this because it was never going to work. It was obviously not going to work from the very beginning.

RAY HADLEY:

On a personal note, back to the campaign, I was amazed by the energy levels of both you and the Prime  Minister, you just kept going, and then on the final day I was driving to work very early, very early, with a  big day in front of me and heard you doing an interview and it would have been about ten to four in the  morning and then you fronted up and spoke to my colleague Alan Jones later in the morning and your idea  was to illustrate that you wanted to go right to the last minute talking to people about where you were  headed. What about the physical toll on you and on Julia Gillard? I mean, you’re both, you know, relatively  young people, but by gee it must be hard.

TONY ABBOTT:

Yeah, you’ve got to be physically and mentally tough to go for the top job and I think I’ve got a degree of  physical and mental stamina, Ray, so, look, I don’t feel wrung out by it, I just feel disappointed at the  outcome. But the reason why I wanted to do that was because I figured that you’ve got to work hard to  establish your credentials for the top job and I didn’t want any Australian to be under any doubt as to how  hard I was prepared to work to get the job and then to do the job well, should I get it.

RAY HADLEY:

I think I’ve found, by talking to Australians every day, they don’t like to say, look, someone to say to them  ‘you’ve got to work harder, you’ve got to be out there and do it’ and then that person who’s preaching to  them in any capacity doesn’t apply that same principle to themselves and I think that’s a very important  point, not just for you but for the Prime Minister as well, that you are prepared to do the hard yards. Having  said that, I suspect that you and your family are looking forward to a summer break over Christmas.

TONY ABBOTT:

Yeah, and that’s when we’ll get a break. That’s the normal time for the political business to go into  hibernation and probably from about the middle of December until sometime towards the end of January I’ll  be taking a decent holiday this year.

RAY HADLEY:

Were you surprised by the comments that appear on the front page of the Financial Review today by BHP’s  Marius Kloppers in relation to the climate action and what he’s said? He’s called for an early introduction of  a price on carbon. They’re saying in ‘a boost to the Gillard Government’s hope of establishing a consensus  on climate change policy’. It appears to me that the last time this was discussed at a world level in  Copenhagen, it appeared that the Prime Minister, then Kevin Rudd, didn’t get any support so I’m surprised  that BHP think that it’s perhaps a fait accompli long-term globally, not just here.

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, all of us want to do the right thing by the environment, Ray, but you don’t need a great big new tax on  everything to reduce emissions and the Coalition’s climate change policy will establish significant  reductions in emissions by 2020. We think we can achieve a five per cent reduction in emissions by 2020  without a great big new tax and this idea that we here in Australia should put a big tax on our businesses and  on our consumers in the absence of similar action from other countries would just put our exports at a  terrible competitive disadvantage and I reject it, I completely reject it. Prior to the election, the Government  itself actually rejected a carbon tax. We had Greg Combet saying earlier this week that the coal industry’s

5

future would be secure under the Government and I think it’s really up to the Government now to confirm  post-election what it said pre-election that they completely reject a carbon tax.

RAY HADLEY:

I don’t know how the shareholders of BHP Billiton would be feeling about their CEO telling them that they  should pay more tax, seeing they export that large amount of coal elsewhere in the world where there won’t  be a carbon tax.

TONY ABBOTT:

Exactly right. I mean, it’s all very well for companies like BHP with international operations. If we put extra  taxes on production in Australia, they just move their production offshore and this is the problem with the  mining tax - a big new tax on mining in Australia just means that companies like BHP and Rio and Xstrata  put the investment into other countries that don’t have these taxes.

RAY HADLEY:

In relation to the Greens, it’s inescapable that a good percentage of people voted for them particularly in the  Upper House and then we’ve got one member of the Greens and one that perhaps leans that way a bit in  Tasmania in Andrew Wilkie. Now that they’ve actually got some power, it’s a coalition effectively of the  Labor and the Greens, it’s a coalition. Now they’ve got some power, I guess the electorate will be looking,  this is where the pressure comes for Bob Brown - it’s been ok in the past to be in the back row, screaming  instructions to you or to John Howard or to Julia Gillard, and now all of a sudden he’s part of the decision  making process and people can see for themselves where we’ll end up if the Greens are given too much  power. Should we be concerned that there is a coalition between the Greens and Labor?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well this is something for the Labor Party to explain. It needs to explain just how it is going to manage this  effective coalition with the Greens and just what is it going to give to the Greens to get their continued  support and I think it’s pretty obvious, Ray, that the Labor Party is going to move to the left, we’re going to  get more radical policies, less business-friendly policies from the ALP in this term of government because  they do have to keep conciliating those Green votes in the Parliament and those Green voters in the  community.

RAY HADLEY:

I’m getting all sorts of comments from our listeners via the email from Port Macquarie particularly, I just  wish they weren’t so defamatory so I could share them with our broader audience. You have been quoted  today as attempting in some way to say well, look, if things don’t go according to plan, and they’ve said  clearly, Oakeshott and Windsor in particular, they’ll vote on matters of supply and they won’t deny  important legislation, but they retain the right to vote as they see fit. You’ve said you can’t see this  allegiance lasting for the three years. Do you think that we’ll be more likely to go to an election as opposed  to then changing allegiances, because they’re saying today, no we won’t be coming your way, we’ll stay  where we are?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well Ray, if this government is as incompetent after the election than it was before the election, I don’t see  how independents acting in good faith could continue to support it for three years. If we have a replay of the  pink batts programme, if we have a replay of the school hall rip-offs - and on this programme you know a  lot about just how disastrous they’ve been - no independent in good conscience could support a government  that was guilty of the kind of maladministration that the Rudd-Gillard Government was guilty of. So, if the

6

Government genuinely improves, if the people who were incompetent and wasteful before the election can  fundamentally change after the election, sure, this government can go full term. But if it is incompetent, I  think the independents have a duty to take the mandate from Labor and give it to the Coalition. Now that  doesn’t mean an election, I’m not asking the public to go through the inconvenience and the expense of a  new election, I would be asking the independents in the event of gross incompetence on the part of the  Government to look at putting another government, a better government, in place on the floor of the  Parliament.

RAY HADLEY:

I spoke to your colleague yesterday, Malcolm Turnbull, and what I tried to do, there is that much out there  about the NBN, I mean the normal urban myth email that obviously you get and everyone else gets and you  try to get to the bottom of it, and I thought he approached it quite solidly. He said ‘yes, I’m a fan of this type  of infrastructure…

TONY ABBOTT:

We all are, Ray.

RAY HADLEY:

…but I’m not a fan of the $43 billion’. I asked him a question he couldn’t answer and maybe you can. You  mentioned and raised the spectre of insulation. Now, I was still arguing in December of last year - before I  went on leave - with Peter Garrett, about how flawed it was and he was arguing black and blue I was wrong.  Well, of course by February the next year, the then Prime Minister Kevin Rudd stopped it in its tracks. Can  you explain to me and to the people listening to this programme, how such a minister could possibly be  rewarded with a promotion in the next government? I mean, does he have photos of someone in a  compromising position? It’s the only possible explanation.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, another possible explanation is that in fact all the relevant decisions weren’t being made by Peter  Garrett, they were being made by Kevin Rudd and that Garrett had to protect Kevin Rudd but if that’s the  case, why has Julia Gillard given Kevin Rudd a big new job? I mean, if Kevin Rudd was the real author of  the pink batts disaster and the school hall rip-offs, why has he been rewarded with Australia’s foreign  policy?

RAY HADLEY:

Sounds like a question that you can’t answer for me, either. We’re left in limbo.

TONY ABBOTT:

One day, perhaps, Peter Garrett will write his memoirs and…

RAY HADLEY:

Geez, I hope I live long enough to see them.

TONY ABBOTT:

…we will learn. Maybe he’ll sing about this one day, but…

RAY HADLEY:

Well, I know, because they’re Cabinet-in confidence, I won’t live long enough to, or maybe I will, maybe  someone will read it to me in the nursing home about what did actually happen in relation to insulation. I  appreciate your time in a busy schedule. Thanks for coming in and spending some time with us.

TONY ABBOTT:

Nice to be with you, Ray.
