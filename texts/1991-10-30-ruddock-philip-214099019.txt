AGREEM ENT ON HONG KONG REFUGEES WELCOMED

The agreement between the United Kingdom and Vietnam regarding the enforced  repatriation of asylum seekers found not to have bona-fide claims for protection, will in  effect be the same procedure Australia follows in regard to its illegal entrants. Ã¢ÂÂ   Â·: : .

Individuals claiming refugee status in Australia have their applications assessed  scrupulously, but if screened out, the authorities follow the only proper course of action,  which is to return them to their country of origin.

It is a great pity that the United States has not yet confirmed that it accepts this  approach outlined in UK/Vietnam agreement. While the USA like Australia, has been  generous in resettling refugees, it has certainly not volunteered to resettle all those  screened out from Hong Kong or other South East Asian countries.

United States support is not necessary for the bi-lateral agreement to be given effect, but  it would be better if the US were to affirm the agreement positively, rather than  acquiesce in silence.

The agreement is a welcome advance which will ensure that first asylum is still available  and minimise the risk that asylum seekers will be pushed off without access to due  process.

It will also encourage asylum Seekers to use proper channels. Hence the agreement will  reduce the risk to life of those forced to travel long distances in unseaworthy vessels.

From Australia's point of view, this is also an important example in the handling of those  boat people who are already in Australia. It suggests the proper, but expeditious  consideration and resolution of claims is required. The Minister, once such decisions have  been taken, must then act quickly to remove any non bona-fide claimants from Australia.

There is little evidence that Australia is seen abroad as having effective and timely  repatriation procedures. The extraordinarily long delays in handling such cases in  Australia has led to a large number of claimants. This mitigates against Australia's  effective control of border entry arrangements.
