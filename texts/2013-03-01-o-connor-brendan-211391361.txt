LIBERALS HIT NEW LOW ON ASYLUM SEEKERS

Yesterday I thought the Opposition had hit a new low by likening people seeking asylum in  Australia to paedophiles.

Today Tony Abbott showed that they can indeed go lower with their disgraceful fear  campaign, claiming thousands of people are “disappearing” into the community.

This is plainly untrue. Asylum seekers are only released from detention on bridging visas  after they have passed health, identity and security checks.

As a condition of their visa, they must report regularly to the Department of Immigration,  either in person or by phone, and they must advise the Department of where they are living.

There is more monitoring of asylum seekers on bridging visas than there was under the  Howard Government’s temporary protection visas - which the Opposition says we should  reintroduce.

Mr Abbott should show some leadership and pull his divided party into line. Instead he  chooses to back his Shadow Minister’s reprehensible scaremongering and pretends not to  know about his Senate Leader’s vile comments.
