ABBOTT SAYS ‘YES’ TO ANOTHER BOAT AND ‘NO’ TO  OFFSHORE PROCESSING

The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Chris Bowen MP, and Minister for Home  Affairs, Jason Clare MP, said another asylum seeker boat was intercepted last night - the  32nd since Tony Abbott rejected the GovernmentÃ¢ÂÂs offer to work together to implement  offshore processing.

“The CoalitionÃ¢ÂÂs consistent refusal to support offshore processing legislation is a significant  factor in asylum seeker arrivals,” Mr Bowen said.

“Mr AbbottÃ¢ÂÂs cheap slogans wonÃ¢ÂÂt stop the boats, but offshore processing will help to stop  people taking these dangerous boat journeys and prevent more deaths at sea.

“Yet the Coalition continues to give the green light to people smugglers because theyÃ¢ÂÂve  cynically calculated itÃ¢ÂÂs in their own political interest for boats to keep coming.”

The latest boat comes as Indonesia yet again made clear its opposition to Tony AbbottÃ¢ÂÂs  plan to Ã¢ÂÂturn back the boatsÃ¢ÂÂ, with Foreign Minister Marty Natalegawa reported as saying it  was not a solution to the people smuggling issue in The Australian today.

“Tony Abbott remains in denial - his tow-backs policy is dangerous and ignores all the  expert advice, including from our Navy which says it is dangerous and risk lives,” Mr Bowen  said.

Mr Clare said it was time for the Coalition to stop being negative and allow for offshore  processing to proceed.

“Working together we can help stop people dying at sea. We can pass legislation to  introduce offshore processing,” Mr Clare said.

“If Mr Abbott is serious about stopping the boats he must stop saying no and pass our  legislation to allow asylum seekers to be processed offshore in Malaysia and Nauru.”
