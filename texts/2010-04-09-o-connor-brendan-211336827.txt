BORDER PROTECTION COMMAND BOARDS VESSEL

(9 April 2010) Border Protection Command has provided assistance to a vessel 73 nautical  miles east-south-east of Christmas Island.

HMAS Wollongong, operating under the control of Border Protection Command and at the  request of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, responded to a distress call and boarded  the vessel at 8:42 pm (AEST) on 8 April 2010.

Upon boarding, there were approximately 70 passengers on board the vessel.  They identified  themselves as asylum seekers and then asked to be taken to Australia.

Just after 2am (AEST) the engine failed on the vessel which began to flounder. The transfer  of passengers to HMAS Wollongong commenced immediately. Approximately 16 passengers  were transferred immediately however some passengers abandoned the vessel.

Passengers were rescued from the water by the crew of HMAS Wollongong.

HMAS Wollongong is now proceeding to Christmas Island with the passengers for security,  identity and health checks.  Defence will provide an operational brief on the matter this  afternoon, at a time to be advised.

The Australian Government remains committed to protecting the Australian border from  maritime threats, including people smuggling. People smuggling is a global and regional  problem and the Australian Government continues to work closely with our regional  neighbours to address this issue.

People smugglers seek out and exploit vulnerable persons who, having faced uncertainty,  conflict and violence, pursue stability and safety. Those who seek to exploit and put lives at  risk through people smuggling will face the full consequence of the law.

The group will be transferred to Christmas Island for security, identity and health checks, and  their reasons for travel will be established.
