E&OE……………………….…………………………………………………………………

DAVID OLDFIELD:

Mr Abbott has been good enough to join us this morning on a whole range of issues. Good morning, Tony.

TONY ABBOTT:

Good morning, David.

DAVID OLDFIELD:

Look, Tony, the Government is still persisting with the lunacy of blaming you for the increase in asylum  seekers. I mean, yesterday we saw the arrival of the biggest boat load this year - 143 in one go, the sixth  boat in a week. Nearly 1,000 asylum seekers and crew arrived so far this year and we’re only in the middle  of February with more expected as soon the monsoon season closes down. There’s a chance that 2012 is  going to eclipse the huge numbers that have come in the last couple of years. With the way you’re copping  the blame, could we perhaps soon expect to see your name, your photo maybe, printed on tickets as the  sponsor of all of this?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well David, look, they blame someone else for everything and they even were blaming me, as we know, for  the Australia Day riot but it turned out that it was the Prime Minister’s office that had been responsible for  that. Look, we’ve got to stop the boats, no doubt about it. There is a proven way to stop the boats: it’s  Nauru, temporary protection visas and the option of turning boats around and this is one of the issues that  the Government has to sort out very quickly and one of the issues that I suppose Kevin Rudd would be  mulling in his mind is what policies would he change if he were to become the leader? Because at the  moment, the Labor Party’s leadership issues are all about personality and, in the end, if it’s to be productive  for anyone, if it’s to be productive for our country, there’s got to be some policy element in it.

DAVID OLDFIELD:

Well, certainly Labor can run and hide on who’s to blame when it comes to the influx of asylum seekers but  it all started with Mr Rudd changing what were the Howard Government’s laws, in 2007, which put out the  welcome mat and there we have it, thousands have come since then.



TONY ABBOTT:

That’s right, David. Look, the day before the election, Kevin Rudd said that he would turn boats around. He  was on the front page of The Australian in 2007 declaring the day before the election that he would be tough  enough to follow John Howard and to turn boats around where that was necessary and appropriate. Not a  single boat has been turned around under this government and it’s one of the reasons why the people  smugglers think that we’re a soft touch.

DAVID OLDFIELD:

People are angry. In fact, I can tell you that when days go by that we leave the issue of asylum seekers alone  - because there is so much else to talk about and we don’t want people to be numb - when those days occur,  I actually get emails saying not enough people are talking about this, why are people not continuing to talk,  the boats keep coming?

TONY ABBOTT:

And the reason, David, why people are so angry about it is because they think that the basic sign of a  sovereign country is the ability to control its borders and if you can’t control your borders you’re at risk over  time of losing control more generally. People want the Government to be in charge, they want the  Government to be able to run the country effectively and a test of that is the ability to control your borders  and that’s why I think people do take this issue so seriously and rightly so.

DAVID OLDFIELD:

The Government’s own figures show very clearly that 99 per cent of these people, as seen in the last 3,000  or so, throw away their documents, including their passports, which of course they had to get to get to  Malaysia or Indonesia in the first place. The Government’s figures also clearly show that 93 per cent of the  so-called asylum seekers, even having once been accepted as refugees five years later, are still on welfare,  without jobs, not having made a contribution in the first place, like someone who may have worked and  indeed as an Australian citizen has some expectation and right to be looked after. Pensioners who this winter  are going to find it very, very difficult to pay their electricity bills and find it hard to get the sort of food that  they want and the warmth and the comfort that they reasonably should have, are going to be looking and  angry as we all are about the stories of $200,000 a week in rent for homes for these people, the whitegoods  and furniture packages and many of them quite clearly looking to be exposed as not much more than those  who want to live in a better place, rather than fleeing from death. How tough will you really be? Will you  stop it?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, David, we did it before under John Howard and we can do it again. You’ve got to have Nauru,  because you’ve got to have rigorous offshore processing. You’ve got to have temporary protection visas,  because you’ve got to deny the people smugglers a product to sell. But this is very important, David. You’ve  got to be prepared to turn boats around, because if you’re not prepared to turn boats around you are not  prepared to protect Australia’s sovereignty.

DAVID OLDFIELD:

We’ve had circumstances here, much seen in the last few weeks with jobs going all over the place, be it the  banks, be it industry, be it now even tomato growers as yesterday announced down at Queensland. The  carbon tax is not quite with us, but already having an impact and indeed I had quite an argument with Craig  Emerson here at the end of last year, who wanted to argue with me that it would have no impact, for  example and specifically on the aluminium industry and now that’s proven to be as I’d suggested it was.  What can we do about that? Do you still stand by turning over and dispensing of the carbon tax?



TONY ABBOTT:

Of course, David, of course. I mean, this is at the heart of our plan to help our nation’s economy. There are  lots of things that are beyond government’s control, but sensible government always avoids making a bad  situation worse and this is what the carbon tax will do. All of the problems on household budgets, all of the  pressures on Australian jobs will be much, much worse under a carbon tax…

[Interruption]

DAVID OLDFIELD:

Sadly something happened with our line there and Mr Abbott has been lost to us. If we can get him back we  will.

[Advertisement break]

DAVID OLDFIELD:

Now, Tony Abbott has been good enough to come back to us. We don’t know what happened with the line  there but it doesn’t matter, you’re here, thanks Tony.

TONY ABBOTT:

G’day, David.

DAVID OLDFIELD:

Tony, look, just quickly, the Pacific Highway, very important to people in New South Wales. It is that road  going out of Sydney that is in many stretches is seen to be a death trap. For like the millionth time, the  funding upgrades that are required just don’t seem to be occurring. Would you have a better relationship, do  you think, with the state government here to do something about safety on the Pacific Highway?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, the short answer is yes. But, you know, one of the problems that we’ve got - it’s a huge one, David -  is when you’re spending $50 billion-plus on the National Broadband Network you obviously have far less  money to spend on what I think are much more pressing tasks like the Pacific Highway, like the roadways of  Sydney. I mean, you know, we still don’t have a proper motorway system in Sydney and how can Sydney be  a first world city if it doesn’t have a first world infrastructure. So, there is a huge infrastructure challenge in  this country and one of the reasons why there has been almost no progress under the current federal  government is because they’re blowing billions on a white elephant such as the National Broadband  Network.

DAVID OLDFIELD:

The circumstances of the leadership of the Labor Party - if such a word can be used in relation to what it is  that purports to be the running of the country - I suggested yesterday that we are suffering from paralysis,  essentially, where this is concerned. There’s no management, there’s no governing taking place - it is all just  behind the scenes and number-crunching and factions. I mean, it’s hilarious to open a newspaper and, in  theory, be able to read who’s on whose side when it comes to a vote for Rudd or a vote for Ms Gillard. Is  Simon Crean any kind of viable third contender?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, I think that it’s really up to the Labor Party to sort and they’ve got to do it soon because as you say,  David, investment isn’t happening, employment isn’t happening, confidence is shattered. If you can have no  confidence in the Government it’s very hard to have confidence in the country but the other thing, I think, is  that relationships inside the Labor Party are now so poisonous that it’s very difficult to imagine - regardless  of what happens next week, regardless of who might ultimately emerge as the leader, whether it’s Gillard  still, whether it’s Kevin Rudd, whether it might ultimately be Simon Crean - it’s almost impossible to  imagine that this is going to be an effective and functioning government. They are so full of poison, they are  so full of bile, they are so full of hatred that it seems to me and I think to increasing numbers of Australians,  they just can’t function as an effective government anymore.
