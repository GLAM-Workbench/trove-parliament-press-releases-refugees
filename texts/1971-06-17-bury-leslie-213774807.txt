AID TO REFUGEES IN INDIA (4)

Some new developments. .  .

Ã¢ÂÂ   The second consignment of Australian relief aid for Pakistan refugees in India arrived in Calcutta early yesterday. The load  consisted of vaccines,"antibiotics, vitamins, plastic for shelter  material and baby food, costing altogether $127,000. .

.  The vaccines - 30)000 shots against typhoid and cholera" and 30)000 against typhoid were offloaded promptly and taken  straight to cold storage facilities in Calcutta.

At the request of the Indian Government, all the vaccines and Ã¢ÂÂ    also 43 of the 83ÃÂ rolls of plastic shelter material will remain for  the time being in West Bengal. However, the rest of the goods will be  taken later today by a chartered Hercules aircraft to Agartala, in  Tripura, the most easterly Indian State. .  .

:  The Indian Government is particularly concerned about the situation around Agartala, where there has been a vei'y large influx  of refugees and where only limited relief facilities are available. India has asked for more flights to Agartala. For technical reasons, it  is not possible to send a Boeing 707 to Agartala.

.  ' Arrangements have therefore been made for a series, (possibly three) of relief flights by RAAF Hercules aircraft to proceed direct  from Australia to Agartala. This will also avoid Calcutta where  traffic is building up as more reli'ef supplies begin flowing in from a  number of other countries. Â·

The first of these flights will leave Australia today. E.T.D.  Richmond air base is 1100 A.E.S.T. The Hercules will.carry more  laminated and woven plastic shelter material especially made up to  Ã¢ÂÂ¢specifications recommended by India, tarpaulins and baby food. The

relief flights to Agartala will continue at approximately weekly intervals.

(NOTE: Sorry for the short notice about departure time for this -  special flight. Arrangements were made quickly and final  details about departure times, flight plans etc., were  only finalised overnight.) Ã¢ÂÂ   Â·  .
