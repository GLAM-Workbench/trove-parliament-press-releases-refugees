PRESS STATEMENT BY THE SHADOW MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION Â·> Â·  I .

AND ETHNIC1  AFFAIRS, MR. TED INNES. Ã¢ÂÂ   i Ã¢ÂÂ   Â·  Â·  Ã¢ÂÂ

The Government today gave further evidence of its indifference

towards the plight of Lebanese refugees.

On September 23, the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic . '  Ã¢ÂÂ   \ .  ' .

Affairs announced special "relaxed criteria" for the

entry of relatives of Lebanese residents in Australia .  .

He said an Immigration task force would be sent to Nicosia

for three months to handle applications for those Lebanese who had

been able to reach Cyprus.

The three-month period expires on December 31. When I asked

the Minister today in Parliament whether this period would be

extended, he refused to give any specific answer. In. his

answer he admitted that the grave refugee-situation

"still exists in the Lebanon" but all he could say was that

the Government would "reassess" the criteria. My understanding

is that the extended criteria will cease at the end of the

year. While the Government is dithering, Lebanese residents

in Australia are left in the dark about the future safety of

their relatives in Lebanon.  .
