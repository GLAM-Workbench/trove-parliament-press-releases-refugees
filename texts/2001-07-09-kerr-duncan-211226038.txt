Citizenship and equality

Words like democracy, citizenship and equality are constantly contested. The last two centuries have seen two distinct conceptions of citizenship and equality vie for adherents within the democratic, non-communist world.

One conception is that grounded in classical liberalism, now subsumed in neo-liberal - or, in Michael Pusey's Australian term, economic rationalist -economics. It sees citizenship as conferring rights of equality on individuals. The state meets its obligations to equality by establishing a framework of rules within which free-market operations are to govern outcomes. In its most authentic tones, it, in the words of Margaret Thatcher, asserts 'there is no such thing as society.'

The alternative conception looks beyond formal rules to substantive outcomes. Advocates of this conception of citizenship and equality assert that the state should provide a foundation of common provision - in Jamrozik's words - a platform of legal, social and economic infrastructure and access to material goods for all its citizens, so that, being relieved of the concern for basic survival, they can pursue their individual interests but within a framework of collective provisions, interests and obligations.

This latter notion is the ideological foundation of the welfare state. Michael Ignatiff points out that the 20th century has seen a struggle " to transform the liberty conferred by formal legal rights into the freedom guaranteed by shared social entitlement. Given the inertial tendency of markets to generate inequality, the state is called upon, by its own citizens, to redress the balance with entitlements designed to keep the contradiction between real inequality and formal equality from becoming intolerable".

Globalisation, however, has caused governments world wide to reorientate their social policies towards the neo-liberal paradigm. This paper looks at what has been happening, asks whether there is anything we can do about these changes, and puts forwards strategies that allow for the alternative conception of citizenship and equality to be reasserted in our globalised world.

The golden straitjacket

Britain's Margaret Thatcher popularised the expression "There is no alternative". She was wrong and in her case the alternative was John Major, then Tony Blair. Ironically, the idea that there is no alternative to governments constraining their expenditure on social justice and repudiating much or all of the welfare state also underpins much of post-Thatcher thinking. Much contemporary political debate seems to accept the paradigms Thatcher championed ... The Queen is dead, Long live the Queen.

Prime Minister Tony Blair put it this way. "These forces of change driving the future don't stop at national boundaries, don't respect tradition. They wait for no one and no nation. They are universal".

This idea that citizens and nation states are powerless to alter the impact of globalisation is best captured in New York Times' correspondent Tom Friedman's phrase the "Golden Straitjacket". Friedman's phrase describes the elements of policy now required of national governments by global capital markets, to sustain the value of their currencies and to remain able to attract or even retain foreign investment.

To fit into the Golden Straitjacket a country must either adopt, or be seen as moving toward, the following golden rules: making the private sector the primary engine of its economic growth, maintaining a low rate of inflation and price stability, shrinking the size of its state bureaucracy, maintaining as close to a balanced budget as possible, if not a surplus, eliminating and lowering tariffs on imported goods, removing restrictions on foreign investment, getting rid of quotas and domestic monopolies, increasing exports, privatizing state-owned industries and utilities, deregulating capital markets and making its currency convertible, opening its industries, stock, and bond markets to direct foreign ownership and investment, deregulating its economy to promote as much domestic competition as possible..... When you stitch all of these pieces together you have the Golden Straitjacket.

Ã¢ÂÂÃ¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»

Yet is it all that clear-cut? If it were, I would join with those who accept the agenda of accommodating the inevitable.

But it is not. Rather, close analysis suggests we are dangerously close to throwing the baby out with the bathwater. If we run down the elements of our common citizenship and make bare the social safety net, what will be left for the dispossessed? What will hold together societies that are increasingly being polarised between the rich and the poor?

Dani Rodrik, author of Has Globalization Gone Too Far?, points out that until the recent past there has been an unmistakable positive correlation between a nation's openness to trade and the amount it spends on social programmes. In his view the social welfare state has been the flip side of the open economy. Its unravelling may undermine the whole edifice.

By any standard, the postwar social bargain has served the world economy extremely well... [The expansion of world trade] did not cause major social dislocations and did not engender much opposition in the advanced industrial countries. Today, however, the process of international economic integration is taking place against a backdrop of retreating governments and diminished

Ã¢ÂÂÃ¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»

social obligations. Yet the need for social insurance for the vast majority of the population that lacks international mobility has not diminished. If anything it has increased.

This is rapidly becoming a much more broadly accepted view. In essays published since the influential The Lexus and the Olive Tree in which the Golden Straitjacket was described, Tom Friedman himself gives greater importance to the legacy of the social welfare state, arguing that attention to the issues of social safety nets may be a precondition to the health of the global economy.

Nor is this any longer just opinion held by academic and media commentators. It is shared by the OECD, (see its landmark publication, Global Markets Matter), the Secretary General of the United Nations and the head of the World Bank. Most importantly, it is increasingly the demand of huge numbers of strongly outspoken citizens and protest groups - some violent and counterproductive, but most simply demanding an end to increasing inequality, and attention to the needs of those who have borne the costs of, not gained from, overall economic growth. They demand global financial architecture to protect the vulnerable from the relentlessness of the market, and they demand accountability and democratic participation in global institutions such as the World Trade Organisation

It is also becoming increasingly clear that further moves towards global trade liberalisation will not be possible unless, at a minimum, issues of labour and environment standards are taken into account. Even the Business Roundtable, the association of chief executives of the United States 150 biggest companies, now accepts and advocates this.

The squeeze of the golden straitjacket: Australia as an example of international trends

I entered the Australian parliament in 1987. Then it was possible to imagine that Australia would resist the seductive claims of globalisation. Australia had high levels of public ownership, including a national bank. Its telecommunications system was state-owned. It had high (albeit reducing) tariffs to protect local manufacturing. The government had put sectoral industry plans in place for the car and steel industries. Australia had the best system of public health-care in the world. State education was free and there were no fees for entry to university. There were no private universities. The government had the power to regulate the money supply. Most revenue was raised through (steeply) progressive income taxes.

Just fourteen years later Australia has been transformed utterly. Many changes were wrought by the Hawke and Keating Labor governments, in which I served - initially as a backbencher and later as attorney-general and as minister for Justice. The conservative Howard government that came to power in 1996 - and has held office since-has contributed regressive social reform to the mix.

Australia now has low levels of public ownership. Successive governments have sold the national bank and the national airline, opened the telecommunications market to competition and partly privatised the national telecommunications carrier. Tariffs have been reduced to negligible levels. Industry plans have not been renewed. Private health insurance has been subsidised, a financial penalty imposed on those who fail to take it up, and the public system allowed to run down. The federal government now provides more funds to support private education than it provides to assist state schools. Fees or charges have been introduced for the universities. Private universities have been established. Governments have forgone the power to regulate the money supply. Income tax rates have been repeatedly reduced and a new regressive system of indirect taxation, the goods and services tax (GST), has been introduced.

I highlighted this social transformation in my book Elect the Ambassador! Building Democracy in a Globalised World. I did so because it was so illustrative of the policy constraints that flow from an acceptance of the disciplines of the 'golden straitjacket.' My observations are neither a mea culpa nor a 'look back in anger'. The Hawke and Keating governments went along with the prevailing neo-liberal economic orthodoxy of their times but they preserved - to a degree unprecedented in comparable countries, with the possible exception of Canada - the key elements of the welfare safety-net. The Howard Government has substantially undone that important legacy.

Whatever the merit of judgments made by governments during those turbulent years it has become clear to me, with the benefit of hindsight, is that Australia, in common with all its regional neighbours and most other countries, is now comprehensively enmeshed in the global economy. Australia, like social democratic governments, world wide, accepted the need for these policies because, like Friedman, they believed they were necessary for their countries to remain internationally competitive, to attract and retain investment and to shift resources to areas of new opportunity. As a result many of the levers that were formerly central to Keynesian national economic policy-setting - the exchange rate, tariffs and control over the money supply - are no longer available. These key decisions are now left, unregulated, to the "market" or granted to remote and unaccountable international institutions. This pattern has been repeated, with minor variants, in country after country across the globe.

I see it as destructive to identify social democracy's future main task as working within these constraints. Those who advocate that we rely more on strengthening the private sector and local communities and on public-private partnerships, while operating within these constraints, seem to ignore the evidence that we are running down the reservoirs of common citizenship we once took for granted. The public sector has been eroded at an escalating level because criteria of efficiency and profitability have been applied uncritically to its activities. Of course, the public sector must work as efficiently as possible but certain areas of its activity cannot be evaluated solely on market criteria. Access to health, education, a clean environment and a range of social and cultural provisions is a public matter, based on well-grounded rights of citizenship in a democratic society. So, too, is accountability. For this reason, infiltration of the public sector by the values and attitudes of the market corrupts the value-base of the public service. The degree of infiltration into the public sector by such values is evident from people's attitudes to public issues and from their declining interest in community activities and in political participation.

Communities can survive the occasional failure of privatised (or public) energy or water supplies, annoying and occasionally disastrous as that may be; but can real democracy survive the shrinkage of quality public education? Can we hold together as a society if the rich separate themselves physically from the rest of us and retreat to live in walled, gated enclaves patrolled by private security firms -leaving even law and order and the provision of policing as a poorly funded public residue?

Equality and inequality

Concerns about inequality are nothing new. They are as ancient as laments about the irresponsibility of youth. Yet, the dynamics of globalisation and the impact of neo-liberal economic policy-settings have given a sharper edge to recent expressions of concern about inequality.

The lead article in the Millennium features published in the Australian on 31 December 1999 was titled 'A decade of division'. Introducing his article, the author Murray Waldren wrote:

How will we judge the 90s? It was the cyber decade, the era of the Supermodel, capitalism's time Ã¢ÂÂÃ¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»

of triumph. But most of all, the period is symbolised by the growth of great wealth - and of the numbers of poor, the homeless and refugees.

Is this picture of a widening gulf between rich and poor accurate?

Two major reports examining this question have recently been released. The first is the United Nations Development Program's 1999 Human Development Report. The second is the OECD's 1998 report Income Distribution and Poverty in Selected OECD Countries. An annex to this OECD report summarises and reviews the findings of other studies covering the period from 1970 onwards on income distribution and poverty within individual OECD countries.

The global picture: inequality between countries

A key measurement tool used by the United Nations Development Program in the Human Development Report is a statistic devised to measure what it calls the 'Human Development Index' (HDI). This is a measurement that combines statistics on life expectancy, education and income - rather than using just raw economic purchasing power - to report on human development.

Using this measuring device, the Human Development Report shows that, overall, people living in the developed world have made strong gains in all areas covered by the HDI since 1975. On average, people in these countries are living longer, are better educated and have become wealthier. However, the gains that have been powered by economic growth and globalisation have not been evenly shared.

All of the ten top-ranked countries on the Human Development Index have experienced strong annual economic growth since 1975. Norway's 3 per cent average annual rate of Gross Domestic Product growth was the highest for this group, while Sweden's 1.1 per cent was the lowest. The highest annual rate of growth for any country was 6.8 per cent, for the Republic of Korea, which ranked 30 on the Human Development Index. However, Korea's outcome would have been downgraded dramatically if the recent Asian economic crisis were taken into account; but the Human Development Report only covers up to 1997. For the developing world the picture is mixed. Some countries, such as Mauritius and Poland, have improved as places to live; others, such as the Russian Federation and Madagascar, have worsened.

The picture is far bleaker for the least-developed countries. All ten poorest nations are African countries. Six of these ten have experienced negative annual economic growth since 1975. The worst outcome was for Sierra Leone, whose population was the poorest of all. It was ranked last (174) on the Human Development Index, having suffered an annual rate of decline of minus 2.2 per cent in its GDP over the twenty-two-year period since 1975. Only four of the bottom-ranked countries achieved positive GDP growth, despite their low starting point. The best result was for Burkina Faso, which reached a growth rate of 1.2 per cent. This is only 0.1 per cent better than the rate of growth achieved by the worst performed of the ten top-ranked countries. In much of Africa the human development indicators have hardly improved at all since 1975. In many instances they have declined. AIDS has reduced life expectancy and incomes have fallen in what were already appallingly poor countries.

It seems clear from this that, at least at the top and bottom ends of the HDI, the wealthiest nations are getting richer and the poorest ones are getting poorer.

A major feature, and driver, of globalisation is the technological revolution that has occurred in the information and telecommunications industries. This is part of the information revolution. As with

economic and financial wealth, the benefits of the information revolution have been very unequally distributed. Buying a computer would cost the average worker in Bangladesh more than eight years' wages; it would cost the average citizen of the United States of America just one month's income.

Surveys have shown that users of the Internet are generally the already well-educated and affluent. In the United Kingdom half of those who use the Internet have degrees. Men dominate: women constitute only 38 per cent of users in the United States of America; in the Arab states they constitute only 4 per cent. Users are young: their average age in the United States is 36 years old and the average user in both Britain and China is less than 30 years old. Despite only one in ten of the world's population being able to speak any English, 80 per cent of all websites are in English. The profile of the average Internet user, thus, is: young, male, from a developed nation or from the ÃÂ©lites of developing nations, well-educated and English speaking. The Internet has had virtually no penetration beyond wealthy, developed countries.

Inequality within nations

The Human Development Report provides strong evidence that most people in developed nations have improved their well-being since 1975. On average, citizens of developed nations are living longer, are better educated and have become wealthier in terms of annual income.

But averages can mislead. If five boys are each given $10 per week pocket money and five other boys are given only $2 per week each, the average pocket money each of the ten children receives is $6 per week. This shows how the careless use of such averages can give a false picture. The mathematical (mean) average doesn't allow us to see the differences within the group of children. To do that we have to look more closely and disaggregate the data.

And one consequence of globalisation has been 'the disaggregation of national economies into sometimes starkly contrasting locales or regions'. In other words, inequality has increased, not only between nation states but also within them.

Global cities such as London and New York are resource rich hubs in the world economy. They link economic and political elites through financial, informational and other commercial and institutional networks. In certain respects the prominence of these key locations is equal to, or perhaps increasingly even greater than, the nations within which they are located.

To think in terms of a globalising economy is to recognise that the processes integrating certain locales for better or worse are intensifying in transnational modes. The global city phenomenon - so essential to the spread of the service economy and the speeding up and growth in importance of capital flows and financial exchanges - is a key indicator. But so are the economically depressed regions of the advanced industrialized economies suffering from the transfer of production and extraction processes to more profitable areas of the world.

Information technology might be thought to level the playing field but, instead, it widens the gulf between the 'haves' and the 'have nots'. Thus, the latest data on household use of information in Australia shows that only 15 per cent of non-metropolitan Australians have Internet access, compared to 26 per cent of those in the cities. This data also reveals that only 17 per cent of households with incomes below $A50, 000 have Internet access, compared to 52 per cent of households with incomes of $A100, 000 or more.

While Australia and the United States have relatively high internet access, this masks the hidden inequalities and the relative exclusion of the regions and the poor from the new economic opportunities opening up for those with a head-start in the information age. This is part of the reason why there is a potent latent populism railing against globalisation, even in the United States of America, which has seen the greatest benefits from global growth. Consider the remarks of Jim Hightower, former Texas Agriculture Commissioner, at an anti-World Trade Organisation rally on 18 October 1999.

[T]his amounts to a class war. I was two years ago outside of Atlanta Georgia, at a Lucent Technologies plant ... and ... we met a woman named Anna Harris, who has worked for Lucent Technologies, a $26 billion-a-year conglomerate that makes telephones and other high-tech products. She had worked there 25 years and worked her way up to $15.59 an hour. That's not bad. That's about 31,000 bucks a year. You're not going to summer in France on that but you can get a little slice of the American middle class out of that. She got that high because she was skilled, she was efficient, she was hard working, she was loyal, she was a quality employee making a quality product .... [T]he company kept messing with [Anna Harris] and said Mexico beckoned, and they needed to speed up production. And if they didn't that they were going to haul off to Mexico. And indeed they said at one point that you've got to take a pay cut. So Anna Harris and her co-workers did. She went from $15.59 per hour to $13 per hour. That took about a $5000 slice out of Anna Harris's life. Now if you're Bill Gates, $5000 doesn't matter, but if you're Anna Harris $5000 is a real piece of change. She's a single parent.

Well the company kept messing with them ... and then along came NAFTA [North American Free Trade Association] in 1993 and within a couple of weeks of the passage of NAFTA, Lucent Technologies backed up U-Hauls to the Atlanta plant and hauled off the equipment and hauled off the jobs of Anna Harris and 1000 other people .... A buck an hour they're paying to Anna Harris's replacement down there. That's a poverty wage in Mexico ... . Then thanks to NAFTA, as pretty as they please, they ship that telephone equipment right back into the United States, back onto our markets, right into our stores without paying a tariff, without honouring any kind of quota, without saying as much as a hidy do to us. Anna Harris, it took her several months but she did finally get another job. She got one of those 23 million jobs that Bill Clinton brags about having created since he's been in office. Hers is at Target and she gets $7 an hour not $13 or $15.59. She gets $7 an hour, but she only gets part-time work. They keep messing with her so they don't have to pay benefits.

Ã¢ÂÂÃ¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»

Anna Harris's experience unfortunately is typical - the poor getting poorer despite living in the richest country on earth. It is confirmed by OECD studies into income distribution and poverty.

What is most startling about the OECD's findings is that income inequality has risen sharply since the mid-1980s in almost all the OECD countries studied. Not one country recorded a decline in inequality for the period from the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s.

From the mid-1970s to the mid-1980s, and from the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s, citizens of the United States experienced a rise in income inequality. The United States of America was the first to show a trend to increasing inequality in the 1970s. Australia and the United Kingdom followed, the increase in inequality being particularly sharp in the United Kingdom in the 1980s. Since the mid-1980s the rise in inequality has spread to continental European countries, particularly to the Nordic nations. For the study period Canada was most successful in resisting the trend to increasing inequality. It was the only OECD

country that showed no increase in inequality.

Democracy, citizenship and fairness

Since the 1970s much debate on social policy has revolved around the constraints imposed by the free market on governments that sought to maintain 'the welfare state'. The argument initially was that these constraints had created an abnormal situation and placed the welfare state in crisis. The notion of 'crisis' was first introduced and elaborated upon by James O'Connor in 1973, in his book The Fiscal Crisis of the State.

Under the relentless pressure for national governments to fit national policy into Friedman's golden straitjacket, O'Connor's abnormal 'crisis' situation has now become a normal condition. The welfare state, as envisaged in its ideal form by the early writers such as Wilensky and Lebeaux, had a very short life. While many of its features remain to varied extents in most industrialised countries, almost all of these remaining features are under increasing pressure of reduction or abolition. That is why the term 'welfare state' is no longer a strictly correct description for such societies.

The new forms of social policy that have emerged since the 1980s have one common feature: namely, an endeavour to control, and preferably reduce, social expenditure. Neo-liberal advocates have put forward two arguments in favour of this. One argument is that welfare expenditure has a negative effect on the economy, by reducing the amount of capital available for investment. The second is that it has a negative effect on the population: namely, the creation of a growing attitude and behaviour of dependency and reduced responsibility - a form of 'moral hazard'.

Increasing pressure from global market forces has led governments in all Western countries, whether enthusiastically or reluctantly, to reduce their taxes and social expenditures as they seek to ensure the inflow of investment capital and to maintain their market competitiveness. Ramesh Mishra makes the link to globalisation explicit, arguing that 'globalisation weakens the ideological underpinning of social protection ... by undermining national solidarity and legitimising inequality of rewards'. But it is also a matter of raw survival. As observed by Ian Culpitt, governments 'are no longer ethically driven by the social needs of their citizenry but by the economic imperatives of survival'. As a result, Culpitt notes:

Political support for traditional welfare states is no longer an obvious feature of the public rhetoric of western liberal democracies. The theoretical rationales which were used to defend the welfare state and its traditional pattern of practical social policies have been challenged. ... An essential aspect of this attack on the welfare state has been the complete rejection of those social ideas of citizenship rights and obligations which were encapsulated in the political and social structures of the welfare states.

Ã¢ÂÂÃ¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»

The attack on the welfare state by the neo-liberal economists has been mounted not only on economic grounds but also as a matter of ideology. The advocates of the 'free' market have represented the welfare state as a threat to individual liberty, arguing that the controls imposed by the welfare state on the 'free' market were reducing populations to a state of serfdom. True freedom, they have argued, can be achieved only through an unrestrictedly 'free' market. Those who espoused such ideas found a receptive political constituency among the increasingly affluent middle-classes, who enjoyed benefits from the welfare state but resented having to pay the taxes, which the state needed in order to fund these services and benefits.

A related feature of this change was the transfer of many public services to private welfare agencies. This

involved a growing acceptance of the neo-liberal argument that 'private welfare agencies can provide a more effective means to recognise distinctive individual or group claims to services'. The movement towards privatisation of welfare services paralleled the privatisation of the material infrastructure -services such as power and water supply, public transport, national airlines, the communications network, and various pieces of public real-estate property. The outcome has been substantial reduction of the public sector and corresponding growth of the influence of market forces.

The role of the state has been reduced to providing the preconditions for the activities of the market and to controlling those who have been excluded from the mainstream of economic and social life - the growing 'human residue' of the market economy, people who are forced to rely for their subsistence on the state. For the majority of the population, however, the market has become the main regulating force and authority, providing a seemingly unlimited range and variety of goods and services.

In presenting this analysis, it is important to emphasise that this significant shift in policy orientation -the subjugation of social policy to the pervading ideology known as economic rationalism - is the reason the industrialised countries (or any country for that matter, perhaps with rare exceptions) can no longer be referred to as 'welfare states'. By any analysis, the period that gave the birth to the welfare state has come to an end. In this period of uncertainty it is more accurate to refer to such states as 'post-welfare states'. This is a theme that is further developed in a lucid and very readable way by Adam Jamrozik in his recent book Social Policy in the Post-Welfare State: Australians on the Threshold of the 21st Century.

Features of the post-welfare state

The dominant feature of post-welfare states is that social policy is used as an instrument of support for free market economic policy - rather than to alleviate the excesses of inequality generated by the market, which was the aim of the welfare state. Government policies in post-welfare states tend to reinforce and aggravate the excesses of inequality generated in the free market. This occurs because governments have become persuaded that market activities must be given free rein, and believe that the most important determining factor in the economy is the level of private profit rather than an equitable distribution of resources.

The post-welfare state is a minimalist state: it may provide a minimum income support for marginalised sections of the population but does not aspire to redistribute income or wealth. On the contrary, the post-welfare state supports and encourages inequality: its social policy is based on the virtues of competition.

Post-welfare state policies, therefore, aim to reduce the bargaining power of wage earners but not to provide any restraint on the profitability of business enterprises nor on the incomes of managers and business executives. The result of these policies has been an unprecedented increase in inequity in income distribution in most industrialised nations, including Australia, and in corresponding lifestyles and life-chances.

The philosophy of the post-welfare state is that material incentives are a stimulus for higher productivity and efficiency, and high rewards are necessary for managers, who possess almost mystic powers that ordinary mortals can neither aspire to nor comprehend. Furthermore, provisions such as income support, emergency relief, or access to care services, are no longer available as a right in a post-welfare state but are stringently rationed according to need, the determination of which is the prerogative of the service

provider. In the provision of these services, the criteria of 'deserving' and 'undeserving' have again become important factors.

Other significant conceptual and policy differences between the welfare state and the post-welfare state are set out below. These differences produce changes in resource allocation and corresponding gains and losses for the well-being of various communities within the population.

The welfare state vs the post-welfare state

Welfare state   Post-welfare state

Acceptance of responsibility for the welfare of all citizens, as a matter of deliberate policy vs

Acceptance of responsibility for welfare as rather unfortunate necessity

Universal entitlements to social provisions vs Selective entitlements

Aim to control the excesses of the 'free'-market economy vs Promotion of market economy principles as

a model to follow

Commitment to the pursuit of equality, at least in access to opportunities and resources vs

Acceptance of inequality as 'natural' and, indeed, desirable to achieve efficiency

Commitment to principles of collectivity vs Commitment to individualism

Maintaining social expenditure at a level ensuring reasonable standards of provisions vs Curtailment of social expenditure to an

absolute minimum

Infrastructure of resources (such as power, water) provided by the public sector vs Reduction of the public sector; privatisation

of the infrastructure

Acceptance of collective bargaining in industry through trade unions vs Promotion of individual work contracts

between employer and employee

Distributing money, services and power through citizens' participation vs Distributing money, some services but no

power to citizens

Social control by the state vs Social control increasingly by the market

What is at stake: conceptions of citizenship

The transformation of formerly welfare states into post welfare states is not simply an economic issue; it changes how we think about citizenship rights. Consider by contrast the agenda offered by most recent social democratic parties with the way Gough Whitlam, the former Australian prime minister, in writing about the philosophy that guided the policy of his government, conceptualised the role of citizen rights:

[My] approach is based on this concept: increasingly, a citizen's real standard of living, the health of himself and his family, his children's opportunity for education and self-improvement, his access to employment opportunities, his ability to enjoy the nation's resources for recreation and cultural activity, his legacy from the national heritage, his scope to participate in the decisions and actions of the community, are determined not so much by his income but by the availability and

Ã¢ÂÂÃ¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»

accessibility of the services which the community alone can provide and ensure. The quality of life depends less and less on the things which individuals obtain for themselves and can purchase for themselves from their personal incomes and depends more and more on the things which the community provides for all its members from the combined resources of the community.

Whitlam, in turn, was drawing on Abraham Lincoln's assertion: 'The legitimate object of the government is to do for the people what needs to be done but which they cannot, by individual effort, do at all, or do so well, for themselves.'

The retreat to privileging the individual and treating acceptance of the responsibility for welfare as just an unfortunate necessity not only conflicts with the social democratic tradition but also threatens emptying the idea of democracy of real content.

In a democratic society there are fundamental assumptions on which public services are established and expected to operate. Certain public assets constitute the core infrastructure of community services: the provision of health, education, public transport, policing, clean air and water, public libraries, and other cultural and recreational facilities. The availability of this core infrastructure hitherto was seen to be essential for the adequate social functioning of a civilised, democratic society, and the efficient operation of such services was seen as important because public property should not be wasted. But the main criterion for their provision, their raison d'ÃÂªtre, is their effectiveness, that is, the discharge of the function for which they had been created - ensuring social rights of citizens in a democratic society. Access to the services constituting this core infrastructure is, or should be available by right to every citizen -something that in a democratic society has to be regarded as a citizen's birthright.

Uncritical acceptance by governments of free-market ideology presents a threat to democracy, one that is particularly evident in the reduction of the public sphere. If the public domain shrinks to nothing, the idea of commonality disappears with it. Without any shared public domain there is no area of life in which all citizens meet and interact as equals.

It also sets in train a vicious cycle of blaming the victims.

Explanations of social problems are now being sought in the characteristics of the populations and individuals experiencing a given problem.

One of the most important issues - poverty among families -increasingly has been translated into child abuse and neglect. Poverty is explained almost solely as the pathology of parents, who are then subjected to punitive methods of remedial intervention. Ironically, the methods of intervention based on this perspective have been developed as part of a worldwide movement among psychologists, psychiatrists and social workers, reinforced by regular international conferences held in attractive locations such as Rio de Janeiro, Sydney, or Queensland's Gold Coast.

Cowed, frightened or willingly co-opted, social work and other 'helping' professions have come to occupy supporting roles of social control. Pursuing structural and social explanations and methodologies has become dangerous and to be avoided. Adam Jamrozik and Luisa Nocella have described the process of social issues being converted into personal problems:

Examples ... are poverty, unemployment, child welfare, and gambling addiction. The source of these problems can be identified in the pursuit of certain values and goals, and in the corresponding allocation of resources. The underlying common factor in the first three problems is

Ã¢ÂÂÃ¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»

inequality, and the source of the fourth is in a state-conducted and state-promoted activity. The common factor in all four problems is the methods of intervention at the operative level, which are based on perceptions of certain personal pathologies in those experiencing those problems. Methods employed entail a range of personal services of a counselling and therapeutic nature reinforced by surveillance and an implicit (and sometimes explicit) threat of withdrawal of income support, or other punitive sanctions. Even when there is some acknowledgment of structural or external causes of the problem, intervention remains in these cases at the operative level, substantiated at times by the argument that 'this is the best one can do.'

The demise of the public sphere driven by the attempt to fit government into the constraints of globalisation has thus meant a reduction of the rights of citizenship. The mere possession of the right to vote for those who govern us, important as it is, is not sufficient to ensure the survival of a democratic system if the public sphere is curtailed. In applying T.H. Marshall's typology of citizenship rights, the exercise of civil and political rights might be formally maintained if the public sphere is curtailed, but social rights - that is, the rights to society's resources -are certainly lost.

Furthermore, a citizen's civil and political rights are also curtailed, in practice, if they are delivered within a public sphere constrained by the same market forces.

The privatisation of such public utilities as the supply of energy or water often endows private providers with monopoly powers. State monopoly, which is subject to scrutiny by public institutions such as the parliament and the auditor-general, is replaced by a private monopoly which is outside any such scrutiny. Accountability becomes an issue as arrangements for the privatisation and contracting out of the provision of public services are usually shrouded in secrecy. Susan Strange sees the issue of accountability as one of the dilemmas of globalisation. She says:

The long struggle for liberty and accountability gradually made at least some states accountable to the people, but globalisation, by shifting power from states to firms, has allowed international bureaucracies to undermine that accountability. None of the new nonstate authorities are accountable; few are even transparent. There is a democratic deficit, not only in Europe, but America, Japan - the entire globalised economy.

Building Democracy in a Globalised World

There is a well-known prayer that counsels us to seek the grace to accept those things that cannot be changed, the courage to change those things that can and the wisdom to tell the difference. It is the credo of practical politicians.

In the short term the first order challenge for any incoming social democratic government must be to restore what it can of the social safety net within the existing constraints of the global economy.

That is in itself a crucial task. It is the reason I support without reservation Labor's campaign direction for the coming Federal election -which focuses on rebuilding the most important elements of social infrastructure, health and education, rededicating ourselves to the goal of reducing unemployment and Kim Beazley's championing of Australia as a "Knowledge Nation".

But we need to distinguish between appropriate policies and programs for a three- or five-year term of office and the wider objective of the social democratic project. To achieve that objective social democracy now needs global, not merely national, ambitions.

More importantly anyone whose conception of citizenship and equality goes beyond the neo-liberal paradigm, cannot simply seek local solutions.

There has been a 'widening, deepening and speeding up of worldwide interconnectedness in all aspects of contemporary social life'. This is particularly evident in the case of economic and financial matters, but it applies equally to cultural, environmental, criminal and security matters. It also relates to the growth of transnational government. Globalisation is not going to go away, it needs to be dealt with. Nor are all aspects of globalisation abhorrent.

Globalisation and open markets have allowed resources to be used more efficiently and productively. There is strong evidence that the efficiency benefits of open trade and investment regimes have led to net economic growth. Prices have usually come down after the removal of trade barriers.

Strategies that are destructive of open markets or that promote protectionism are, therefore, not only naÃÂ¯vely impractical but also flawed in principle. Further any developed world nation that unilaterally attempted to reintroduce tariff protection would invite retribution.

The net gain in global growth generated by globalisation however has come at a cost. Globalisation has been responsible for increasing inequality within nation states and between the richest and the poorest countries. The rhetoric of those who still argue that 'a rising tide raises all boats' or that gains to the wealthy will 'trickle down' has been proved wrong time and time again.

The facts don't fit the theory. Trickle down hasn't trickled. Many boats have been left stranded. Millions of people have correctly concluded that their interests have been treated as marginal, their losses ignored, their job security lessened, their costs not compensated, their futures left bleaker than ever before - all because of globalisation.

The problems of globalisation require international government

It is now unrealistic for citizens to expect that their national government, single-handedly, will be able to solve problems that are no longer national in character. Issues as diverse as crime, culture, labour standards, environmental responsibility, trade, taxation, financial stability and biotechnology - all once could be regulated by national laws. Now their regulation requires a framework of international government.

The growing disparity of wealth between the developed and least-developed world is also a product of globalisation. The idea that there are effective national 'development' policies that can lift grossly disadvantaged nations up by their own bootstraps, and lead them out of poverty so that they can enjoy economic parity with their wealthy counterparts, has been discredited. The remedy for the problems of under-development, if sought, is not just self-help. Solutions must move beyond that and be international in scope.

The regional and other disparities that globalisation has given rise to will be difficult to overcome - if not impossible - unless minimum standards on social issues can be agreed between nations. In particular, policies to sustain adequate collection of taxation are vital if the golden straitjacket of globalisation is to be refitted. This will require international cooperation and international institutions.

Social democracy can only be built on the willingness to address the twin issues of growth and fairness. That is why we must now give priority to developing international approaches that seek to tame the

anarchy of financial markets, to establish multilateral agreements on minimum social and labour standards, to set global environmental benchmarks and to curb transnational tax avoidance.

Only by shifting the focus of democratic debates to the international sphere can solutions for these, and similar issues be imagined. It means that the current undemocratic way in which these issues are decided must be challenged. How to achieve this, rather than seeking to squeeze the social democratic project into an ever-tighter straitjacket of what the existing order of the global economy allows is in my view the biggest question facing Labour parties around the world.

The ten proposals for global social democracy:

1 Develop a program to deal with the negative structural consequences of globalisation Ã¢ÂÂÃ¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â» 2 Foster the evolution of transnational political groupings Ã¢ÂÂÃ¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â» 3 Establish a second, directly representative, assembly for the United Nations Ã¢ÂÂÃ¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â» 4 Democratically preselect leaders of key international bodies Ã¢ÂÂÃ¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»

5 Introduce citizen-initiated recall provisions for key international positions 6 Establish processes for the democratic endorsement of national nominees for international posts Ã¢ÂÂÃ¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»

7 Require open negotiation processes in making regional and international agreements Ã¢ÂÂÃ¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â» 8 Allow participatory involvement in key international agreements before they are made or adopted Ã¢ÂÂÃ¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»

9 Insist that non-government organisations meet minimum standards of internal democratic accountability before they receive accreditation in international forums Ã¢ÂÂÃ¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»

10 Elect advisory chambers for transnational regional associations Ã¢ÂÂÃ¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»Ã¯Â¿Â»

These ideas, developed by me in more detail in Elect the Ambassador!, are intended to open a conversation that social democrats need to have, rather than to lay down a fixed plan.

It is now commonplace to recognise that globalisation has shifted power from local and national government to transnational institutions. What then holds back social democratic parties and other citizens who place a high value on democracy from asserting the logical case for democratic control of the institutions of international government? Perhaps the only answer is the natural propensity of those who hold positions of authority and influence to cling to the comfort of continuing business as usual. We should not be surprised when insiders gloss over challenging ideas that threaten their status and power. Stephen Jay Gould, the pre-eminent populariser of science, cited Freud as the key to answering the conundrum of how it is possible for humans to know, intellectually, that an old system of thought is no longer tenable yet to continue to behave as if it were.

In a famous statement, Sigmund Freud argued that scientific revolutions reach completion not when people accept the physical reinstruction of reality thus implied, but when they also own the consequences of this radically revised universe for a demoted view of human status. Freud claimed that all-important scientific revolutions share the ironic property of deposing humans from one pedestal after another of previous self-assurance about our exalted cosmic status. Therefore, all great revolutions smash pedestals - and inspire resistance for the obvious reason that we accept such demotions only begrudgingly.

Globalisation has unleashed a 'revolution' that is smashing the underpinning of purely national politics. The way we trade, the way we communicate and the way we govern our lives - all are affected by this revolution.

No national government acting alone can call a halt to these processes. But we are not just powerless passengers along for the ride, whether we like it or not. Globalisation also presents us with opportunities to begin anew: building responsible and democratic institutions of international government. Economic and social revolutions call on us to craft new approaches. We should heed the parallels in history. Useful analogies can be drawn between the changes now being wrought by globalisation and the information revolution and those generated by the industrial revolution two centuries ago. The industrial revolution generated vastly greater productivity and wealth than had feudalism, but it also produced the poverty and 'dark satanic mills' of Dickensian England.

Like the industrial revolution, globalisation has produced greater productivity and economic growth, but at the cost of greater disparity of wealth and at the price of an increasing exclusion of the poor.

The solutions suggested by the Luddites and by Marxists to redress the cruelties of the industrial revolution were flawed. Yet, successful alternatives did emerge. Social democratic policies succeeded in creating social bargains in which the vulnerable were, at least to a degree, compensated and protected from the bleak relentlessness of the market.

Globalisation has corroded and limited any single governments ability to sustain what the welfare state achieved. This is not to deny that defending and reshaping what remains of the welfare state to better accommodate new needs in education, housing, health and aged care is still a worthwhile national objective. But, increasingly, defence of social bargains will not be possible at a national level.

Unless discussion of these issues is shifted into the international arena, the pressure to reduce expenditure on social programs is likely to become irresistible. Democracy will become a hollow shell if we persist in thinking about issues of equity and rights only on a national scale.

Nor is it enough to 'think globally but act locally'. Our world has changed. There is nothing unambiguously 'local' remaining.

Effective democratic participation in our world is now not possible unless we both think and act globally. Some share of our energy and commitment as citizens, therefore, has to be devoted to asserting our rights as members of the global community. As former US Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbot correctly points out, the very word 'foreign' is becoming obsolete.

The fate of democracy will be determined by how we adapt to that reality. Authorised by Geoff Walsh, 19 National Circuit, Barton ACT 2600.
