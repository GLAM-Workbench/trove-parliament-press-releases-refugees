Subjects: St Vinnies CEO Sleepout; taxpayer-funded advertising; Julia Gillard’s Malaysian people swap;  Kevin Rudd.

E&OE……………………….…………………………………………………………………

LISA WILKINSON:

Opposition Leader Tony Abbott has spent a night on the streets of Sydney, sleeping rough as part of the  Vinnies CEO Sleepout and I’m pleased to say he joins me now looking very fresh-faced but it was a wet and  chilly night in Sydney last night, Mr Abbott. How did you go?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well I survived, that’s the important thing, I guess, Lisa and the good thing about something like this is that  a lot of people who are normally in pretty comfortable circumstances at least have some better  understanding now of those who have to do this all the time. So, I guess a) we should count our blessings  and b) we should be more appreciative and sympathetic towards others and I think there’s some important  lessons there.

LISA WILKINSON:

Do you know how much was raised overnight?

TONY ABBOTT:

A lot of money, a very great deal of money. Ralph Norris and John Hartigan both raised about $100,000  each. I think something like $3 million right around Australia was raised which is great for Vinnies and it’s a  sign that that spirit of decency is alive and well, even in the boardrooms of Australia.

LISA WILKINSON:

Yeah, it’s really, really good to see - way too many people sleeping on our streets at the moment. Meantime,  back to the business at hand. Now, taxpayers are set to foot the bill for a $12 million advertising campaign  for a carbon tax. It has plenty of people fired up. People are calling it a waste of money. This was the  response from independents Rob Oakeshott and Tony Windsor yesterday. Take a look.

ROB OAKESHOTT:

I totally disagree with the decision and totally disassociate myself from the decision.

TONY WINDSOR:

It almost puts us in a position where we’re endorsing the spending of public funds on  propaganda and I’m not prepared to do that.

LISA WILKINSON:

Two pretty crucial people there disagreeing. A problem for the Government, Mr Abbott?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well it certainty should be. Julia Gillard called taxpayer advertising an abuse, that’s what she said. She said  before the election that it was an abuse, taxpayer-funded advertising. Obviously two key independents agree  with her pre-election view. Let’s hope that if it comes to the parliament next week those independents  maintain their rage.

LISA WILKINSON:

But compared to the WorkChoices ad campaign spend when you were in government of $120 million,  doesn’t this become a bargain by comparison?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well look, I just make the obvious point that two wrongs don’t make a right and the fact is that this is yet  another example of grotesque inconsistency from this government and we see it all the time and this week,  for instance, the Malaysia deal has been in the news and Julia Gillard said before the election there was no  way that boat people would be sent to countries that haven’t signed the UN Convention on Refugees and  here we have an example of just that.

LISA WILKINSON:

Now, on that subject, you visited Nauru this week convinced that this return to the Pacific Solution remains  the answer to the asylum seeker issue. Now, yesterday you suggested in parliament that this was the cheaper  option and yet looking at the Pacific Solution 1,500 went through that at a cost of one billion taxpayer  dollars. That’s $600,000 per person. That sounds like a very expensive solution.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, that’s not correct. It was under $300 million in Nauru, so that’s just not correct, Lisa.

LISA WILKINSON:

Well they were the figures that I saw yesterday.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, trust me, the costs of Nauru - keeping it open from 2001 until 2007 - was under $300 million. So,  that’s why I say Nauru is more humane, more cost-effective and certainly proven in a way that Malaysia is  not.

LISA WILKINSON:

Well yesterday both houses of parliament took a rare step in condemning the Government’s Malaysia  solution. That’s a pretty embarrassing defeat to the Government.

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, it’s absolutely unprecedented. Not once in our history has a government policy been condemned by  both houses of parliament and what we’ve got now is a government which is not just in a dispute over policy  but it’s in defiance of the parliament and the point I make, Lisa, is that it’s one thing for the Greens to  condemn this bad policy, what they now need to do is to force the Government to drop it because this is a  Labor-Green alliance and this is a big question for Bob Brown. Is he prepared to force the Government to  adhere to what he thinks are decent principles here?

LISA WILKINSON:

Ok, now, moving on, the papers are full of a particular photograph today. There was a seven and a half  minute meeting between Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard yesterday and it ended in this photo and it certainly  doesn’t look like there’s any love lost there. The body language kind of says it all. What do you reckon was  going on?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, there are a lot of issues at the moment where, frankly, Kevin Rudd should be assisting the  Government. You’ve got the Malaysia people swap, you’ve got the Indonesian cattle deal problem and I  suspect this is what Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard were discussing. Whether Kevin Rudd was offering to  help the Government and Julia Gillard was saying no we don’t need your help, whether there was some  other issue internal to the caucus, I just don’t know and I’ll leave it to them to explain. The tragedy we’ve  got here, Lisa, is that we have a country with a few problems and we’ve got a dysfunctional government  because if the Foreign Minister and the Prime Minister of the country can’t have a constructive working  relationship, obviously that is a disaster for any government.

LISA WILKINSON:

Ok. Just to finish on a light note, Mr Abbott, at the Midwinter Ball on Wednesday Julia Gillard joked that  she was going to offer herself up for a second charity item, an elocution lesson teaching people how to say,  ‘look at moi,’ Kath and Kim-style. How good is your impression? Let’s see if yours is worth more?

TONY ABBOTT:

Moving forward! How did I go? Look, Julia often criticises me for using three word slogans like ‘stop the  boats’ but, you know, she was pretty good at a two word slogan, ‘moving forward.’ I just don’t know…

LISA WILKINSON:

You’ve got to do ‘look at moi,’ Mr Abbott. Come on. Go on, give us one go.

TONY ABBOTT:

Perhaps I need an elocution lesson from the Prime Minister.

LISA WILKINSON:

After me, ‘look at moi.’

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, I don’t want to draw attention to myself! Honestly, I don’t.

LISA WILKINSON:

You’re not going to play are you? Ok, Mr Abbott. Well, well done last night. It was a really good effort and  a lot of good money raised. Thanks very much.

TONY ABBOTT:

Thanks so much, Lisa.
