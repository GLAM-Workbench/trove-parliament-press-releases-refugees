Afghan Refugees Arriving in Australia from Nauru

VPS 93/2004

The first of 146 Afghan refugees on Nauru will arrive in Australia this evening.

Minister for Immigration, Senator Amanda Vanstone, said the arrival of the first group of refugees followed  the Government's commitment late last year to reassess the entire Afghani caseload on Nauru, in light of  updated information from the UNHCR about changed circumstances in Afghanistan.

'Of the 146 people reassessed by Australia to be in need of refugee protection, there are 55 children, 70 men  and 21 women,' the Minister said.

'In the first group of 35 arriving this evening, there are 19 children, 11 men and five women.

'They will be resettled in Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, the ACT and Tasmania. A number of the arrivals  have family members already residing in Australia.

'All of the refugees arriving this evening have been granted secondary movement visas. 26 refugees were  granted three-year visas, the remaining nine were granted five-year visas.

'These visas are available to people who have abandoned or by-passed effective protection in a country of first  asylum and travelled to another country to seek a preferred migration option.

'Departmental officers are working with the remaining 111 Afghan refugees in the Australian caseload on  Nauru and it is expected most will be resettled to Australia in the coming weeks,' Senator Vanstone said.

'The next group of up to 40 people is due to arrive in Australia next week and arrangements are being finalised  to bring the remaining refugees to Australia, possibly by charter flight in the week commencing 12th July.'
