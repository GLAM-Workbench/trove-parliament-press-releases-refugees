AUSTRALIA'S MESSAGE TO U.N  WORLD CONFERENCE FOR WOMEN

The Minister for Home Affairs,  Mr Bob Ellicott,  who leads  Australia's delegation at the World Conference of the  United Nations Decade for Women,  yesterday addressed the  conference at the Bella Centre, Copenhagen.

The text of the Minister's statement on behalf.of Austr.aliar;  is attached. *Ã¢ÂÂ  Ã¢ÂÂ

No. 5 1 of 1980,  Copenhagen, Denmark

I congratulate you on your election as president of  this extremely significant conference. Others have paid tribÂ­ ute already to your experience and your dedication. The  Australian delegation associates itself with these statements.

.I congratulate the other members of the bureau on  their election.

.  I thank Her Majesty the Queen for tier presence, and

her perceptive remarks.

We are grateful to the Danish Government for hosting  this conference. -

It is especially significant that this second world  conference convened by the United Nations to consider the  situation of women should be held in Copenhagen,  for it was  here on 8 March 1910 that International Women's Day was first  proclaimed by a group of women meeting to discuss some of the

issues which we will be addressing in the next fourteen days. The anniversary of that meeting has become a time for women all  over the world to reaffirm their common experiences and  aspirations. We hope and expect that this conference will keep  ...alive ,.thi;s .tradition of. international co-operation in efforts

to raise the status of women.

Australia, as a member, of the preparatory committee '   for the conference, recognises that preparation for a meeting of  this magnitude is extremely demanding. My delegation compliments  the Secretary-General,  Dr Lucille Mair, and her staff on their.:.'  work.  Dr- Mai r 1s speech has set the tone for our conference.

Her experiences of responsibility for areas of national and  particularly international concern fit her admirably for the  task.

Madam President,  .  .

I would like to extend a particularly warm welcome  to the representatives of Zimbabwe. Australia was pleased to  be able to play a part in the process which brought Zimbabwe  to independence earlier this year and looks forward to a conÂ­

tinuing olose relationship with Zimbabwe as a soverign '   independent nation.

Our membership of the preparatory committee gave us  the opportunity not only to contribute to preparations for this  meeting but has helped crystallise our thinking on the key  issues and reinforced our belief that progress in raising t h e .

status of women all round the world depends on commitment to the  task. It will only be achieved if governments and international  agencies constantly and critically appraise their efforts towards  the goal.

The charter of the United Nations organisation reaffairm:  in its opening statement faith in fundamental human rights and in  the equal.  rights of men and women.' It was therefore logical that  one of the first of all the commissions established by the United  Nations was the Commission on the Status of Women. Australia

is proud to have been four times a member of that Commission. We have welcomed the opportunity to participate in and contribute  to the Decade for Women. I am especially pleased to be able Ã¢ÂÂ

to announce today a substantial increase in the Australian  contribution to the Voluntary Fund for the Decade for Women.

2

We believe that the fund makes a real contribution to  improving the daily lives of women in the developing world.

I am also very happy to announce that tomorrow  I will sign for Australia the Convention on the Elimination  of a. 11 Forms of Discrimination Against Women.  This will  signify Australia’s commitment to the principles which underlie  the Convention. It will encourage us to continue the pursuit  of practical measures designed to eliminate discrimination.

I regard the Convention as the most important of all interÂ­ national instruments for women's advancement.

Madam President, Australia has undertaken many  practical measures for the advancement of women. Australian  women have been entitled to vote since Australia became a  nation in 1901. They enjoy equality before the law, full legal

capacity and rights of citizenship, equal rights and entitleÂ­ ments to education, welfare and health services, equal pay  and access to employment. .

Since the commencement of the United Nations Decade  for Women steps have been taken to strengthen our capacity  to respond to t h e .diverse-needs of' women in the community and  to protect their rights. The Australian Government has  upgraded and expanded its Office of Women1s Affairs, set  up women's policy units and equal opportunity units in  Government Departments,and agencies, and established a  National Women's Advisory Council. .

Three of our six State governments have enacted .

wide ranging legislation prohibiting discrimination on grounds  of sex and marital status, arid similar legislation is to be  introduced in a fourth State and in the Australian Capital  Territory. Four State governments have appointed advisers  on women's affairs and most States have special advisers  ,  on the education of women and girls.

One of the great tasks facing this conference is  to suggest ways of ensuring that women will have a voice  in the basic decisions affecting the development of their  countries. Although Australian.women have had full voting  rights for the whole of this century and there has been no

legal restraint on their standing for Parliament, there  are few women in our Parliaments. The same low representation  of women is repeated in the top echelons of the bureaucracy f   .  trade unions and business. '

The Australian Government established the National  Women's Advisory Council to give .  to our women a more effective  voice in government. The council consists of twelve women  of diverse views and experience appointed by the Government

to advise on issues relating to women. '

In preparation for this conference it embarked on an  ambitious and unprecedented program of community consultations  to ensure that the Government would be aware of the views  of women and take these views into account in determining  the national priorities for the second half of the Decade .

for WomenÂ·  At meetings convened by the Council all over  Australia - in cities, in towns and in remote and rural  areas - women put their views. It was not, of course,  to  be expected that all women would agree tin all matters.

-'Women, like men and like nations,  have different perspectives  . Â· : and priorities. Nevertheless there are a great many matters. Ã¢ÂÂ .of universal relevance on which Australian women agree. I  .hope that this conference will establish conclusively that

-there are many issues of profound significance for women on  =  which nations agree. .

Ã¢ÂÂ  ' / ;  I have spoken of the Advisory Council because I

; ;  believe it has been a very successful initiative for Australia. ‘  In appointing its Convenor Mrs Beaurepaire,  Deputy Leader  of the delegation, my Government has recognised its significance.  Ã¢ÂÂ¢  -Australia relaises that it is not enough to pass laws and set  i  Ã¢ÂÂ up machinery. .  ,

v In Australia the family is still regarded as the basic

‘  unit of our society. Greater pressures are being placed on the  i -family, particularly on women within the family.  Marriage  breakdown is not uncommon. One in ten families is a single  .-parent family and eight out of ten of these are headed by

:  women. .

-Female participation in the Australian workforce has  .  increased substantially in recent years. About 37 percent of -  -the total labour force are women of whom nearly two thirds are  -married. In 1954, 12.6 percent of married women were working

full-time.  By 1976, 43.8 percent of married women were working.  Over one third of these were working part-time.  Statistical -   projections suggest increasing participation in the workforce  --by married women, especially women of child-bearing a ge.

To some extent women who stay at home and care for  Ã¢ÂÂ   - children feel that their position as mothers is being depreciated  and that the value of their contribution to society is not  adequately recognised. .

/ In these respects Australia is no doubt in the same .

" position as many other countries. My point, however,  is that  none of us will adequately deal with the issues relating to the  .  status of women unless we also turn our minds to the problems  confronting women in the home, or married women at work,  or

single mothers or to the growing pressures on the single income  “"'family. These are matters of constant concern to my GovernÂ­ ment, and in recognition of them we have taken a number of  '  positive steps. .  .

Ã¢ÂÂ¢  We have introduced a system of family allowances for

h women with dependent children and we have recently given . - additional help to single income families. There is also an  extensive program for the provision of child care facilities. ’  We provide funds for the operation of 99 refuges which in

the past year provided shelter for 12,000 women and their  .  15,000 children in domestic crisis. Clearly, governments  must initiate practical programs such as these to assist Â·   women to exercise their rights ro equal opportunity and equal

status. It Is not much use women having rights if they cannot  turn them to account.

This conference will be a success only if it has  meaning for women the-world over. Our deliberations and con-  Ã¢ÂÂ elusions must take account of their .views and aspirations. Our roles as representatives of nation states and our special

political concerns should not distract us from our Â·

fundamental obligations here which have to do with the  everyday needs and concerns of those women this conferÂ­ ence and the decade are designed to assist.

I hope that this conference will establish  conclusively that there are many issues of profound  significance for women on which nations agree. Australia  believes that this conference will be fruitful if deleÂ­ gations keep in mind their responsibility to the world's  women, especially the poor, the powerless, those whose  views are seldom articulated, those denied their fundaÂ­ mental human rights by all forms of oppression.

We must be prepared to accept the discipline of  focussing sharply on the real obstacles to women's progress  and on the elaboration of specific strategies and programs  for overcoming these, substituting tough practical proposals  for high sounding but facile rhetoric. This conference  requires of participants sensitivity to women -s needs,  a clear perception of the measures- which will"promote their  advancement, and the will to give them effect.

The spirit of optimism generated by International  Women's Year may have led many to believe that will alone  would be sufficient to raise the status of women. The  review of the last five years shows that progress is more

difficult and more complex to achieve than we realised. We still have a long way to go. Australia expects this  conference to come to grips with the major obstacles to  progress and to concentrate on pertinent and practical

action. .

We do not believe that women need to be or  should.be shielded from debate on the significant political  issues of today. But at the same time this is a conference .   about how women are to achieve their rightful place in society -  and we should ensure that we do not lose sight of that central  concern. Debate on all items on the agenda should concentrate  on practical measures of assistance to women in their different  environments.

Some have expressed concern about the value of this  conference. Australia is among the optimists. The. disadvantages  .  suffered by women are the disadvantages of society as a whole.  Society is the poorer when half its resources are not fully

mobilised. At the same time we do not believe that raising the  status of women or ensuring equal opportunities for women should be  seen only or indeed primarily as a means of achieving national  development goals. It is far more fundamental than that.

It is a question of treating each woman as an individual  with her own dignity and self respect and the power to make  decisions about her own destiny.

We recognise that special measures, are required  for women who are particularly disadvantaged. Australia .   is making special efforts to ensure that migrant and AborÂ­ iginal women have access to facilities and services generally  available in the community and share in making decisions about  programs aimed at their own communities.

We welcome the inclusion in the agenda of an item on women  refugees. All refugees,  women and m e n , suffer hardship and  deprivation, but women bear special burdens. The plight  of women refugees in Africa and Asia has made this clear. Yet their problems have never before been the subject of  discussion in an international forum. This conference will  be breaking new ground. The discussion paper prepared  by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees is a  very useful start and points the way to future action by

international agencies and national governments, action  which is urgently needed.Â·

Australia would like to see the program of action  for the second half of the Decade for Women give more detailed  guidance on effective mechanisms, at the regional and interÂ­ national levels, to promote integration of women in developÂ­ ment and support and complement efforts made by governments

at.the national level. We would like to see the U.N.  strengthen its capacity to deal with status of women issues  and to integrate these into the mainstream of its activities.  The conference should give careful consideration to .ways in '   which this might be done. ’

For example, should a Special Adviser to the  Secretary-General of the U.N. be appointed or should there  be an inter-divisional working group within the U.N.  Secretariat? What should be the relationship between any  new position or body and the existing mechanisms? What  role should the Commission on the Status of Women have? These are some of the questions this conference must address.  My delegation stands ready to join with other delegations in  developing proposals. .

Finally, the Australian Delegation calls on the  United Nations itself and its specialised agencies and .   regional commissions to set an example in their own policies  / and practices.  They must develop and support practical

projects to raise the status of women and promote their  .  active participation in the development process. We should  like to see more women employed at the senior levels of  the Secretariat. The practices of the United Nations

organisation must not fall short,  as they now do, of  standards set for governments.

Ultimately this conference will be remembered not  for its handling of issues debated in so many other interÂ­ national forums but for its commitment to dealing with the  factors which shape the daily lives of women and its thinking  of programs to assist women wherever they are - in cities,

towns and villages, in the world's nations.
