~<.eynote speech by Senator Gareth Evans, Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs , to

the 12th Australia-Japan Ministerial Committee meeting, Tokyo, 2 Nove ber 1993

My Australian Ministerial colleagues and I are delighted to be here in ToKyo for the  12th Meeting of the Australia-Japan Ministerial Committee. You have welcomed us

warmly and graciously, Foreign Minister Hata. As always in Japan, we feel

ourselves immediately to be with very close friends.

This meeting is significant in two important respects. First, it is now twenty years

since our countrie~ first established the AJMC . Almost unique in its structure, this

bilateral ministerial dialogue of ours on political and economic issues has played a

major role in shaping the close, comprehensive and confident relationship we have

today. I have been coming to th~se meetings now for nearly a decade, wearing a

number of different ministerial hats. Over that time I have seen our meetings

become more broad in the range of issues addressed , more deep in the intensity of

discussion on particular issues, and ever more direct, relaxed and free-flowin9 in

~tyle . I hope rhat we can continue all of these trends today, and in doing so add still

more dimensions to our "Constructive Partnership".

The other significant aspect of uÃ¢Â‘ 1is rllet:!ling i:; that it cumes at an historic time In

Japanese politics, soon after the inauguration of the Coalition Government. You are

embarking on a major process of adaptation and change : we under ::;le:uK.i the

magnitude of your task, and wish you well in it. It is similar in some ways to the

complex and difficult process we have been through ourselves in the last decade as

we have internationalised the Australian economy , and come to terms ih many new

ways with the reality of our geography as an Asia Pacific nation.

Since this Committee last met in 199Ã¢Â‘ 1 the rush of events, both intemal and

inlernational, have left us all a little breathless. Ou r agenda today will cover many

different political, security and economic issues - g:obal, regional and bilateral

levels. There is one particular theme however that will often recur in our

discussions, and which I would like to emphasise at the outset - and that is the very

rapid emergence over the last few years of a re

2

The most obvious manifestation of this in the economic context has been the rapid  evolution of APEC , and ir1 the political and security context the recent creation of the  ASEAN Regional Forum . But I believe this emerging setise of Asia Pacific

community is beginning to have an even wider significance : changing the way in

which all countries in the region are thinking, at all levels, about their relations with  each other. We have a chance to create, in this very diverse region of ours,

something quite new: a region of real peace, and real pro~perity, worKing

cooperatively together in the common interest to bridge gaps of culture and

ideology, and in some cases very different levels of development, all of which have

been sources of tension and conflict in the past.

1 believe that Australia and Japan share very similar visions about our regional

future and that, ju:st as we have worked so well together in the past, we can play a  real leader:ship role together Jn the future to make that vision a reality.

International Security Environment

There nave certainly been many great improvements in the international security  environment flowing from the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold

War, including:

superpower agreements for significant reduction in nuclear arsenals;

additional C~dher~nb to the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty;

significant moves towards the negotiation of a Comprehensive Test Ban

Treaty:

the conclusion of the Chemical Weapons Convention;

the signing and implementation of the Cambodian Peace A;;cord. an

immensely positive development to which Australia and Japan both

contributed, and which we can both regard with some pride;

the inclusion of Russia. CJ-,ina and Vielnan " - and Laos - in regional political

and security consultative processe:s, now formalised as the new ASEAN

R~gional Forum; and

!.

the clear articulation by the Clinton Administration of a United States policy

commitment to the Asia Pacific-and in particular express US statements of

intention to maintain key military undertakings in North East Asia as the

cornerstone of an overall commitment to compreht:ilsive political and

economic engagement in the Western Pacific.

Unfortunately, the new strategic environment has not swept away all problems,

including:

the unresolved issueÃ¢Â‘ of the DPRK's nuclear program and the need to

ameliorate tensions on the Korean peninsula;

the issue of the Northern T erritorles;

on a wider international front, reform in the structures and processes of the

United Nations system - In this regard, we conti6ue to support Japan

becoming a permanent member of the Security Council, and hope that Japan

will support our efforts (spelt out in my recently published book Co-operating

for Peace) to improve the intemalional machinery for the resolution, and  above all prevention, of conflict; and

the continuing imperative to ensure the observance of universal standards of

human rights, notwith5tanding the sensitivities and difficulties involved.

International and Regional cconomlc Environment

Y../e meet at a particularly critical time for the international economic system. We

have e dete end a deadline (15 Dt~t,;~mu~r) by which we will Know whether we are to

be working in the future within a . vigorous. constructively evolving, multilateral

trading system - . or rather whether the vital and ambitious Uruguay Round has

foundered, and we are looking instead at a trading system in danger of rapidly

deteriorating.

Rational self-interest demands, for Japan and Australia and every country

dependent on global trade, that there be a successful outcome to the Round _  Au:;;~trelie's leadership of the Cairns Group and Japan's position as an economic

power of the first rank can give considerable weight Lo lhe intf;!rnational efforts in

these critical final weeks of the Round . By asserl.ing a leadership role, Japan has

4

on exceptional opportunity to make a major conlr iuution to removing remaining

bottlenecks in the market access package and to securing a genuinely trade

liberalising result on agriculture, in parlicular by agreeing to'a schedule which is

consistent with the DunKel text and with comprehensive tariffication without

exception.

We also see APEC as a logical means for pursuing cioser integration , and ultimately  further trade liberalisation, among Asian Pacific economies. APEC has been placed

on a firm in~titutional footing, and uÃ¢Â‘ ,e initiative for a leadersÃ¢Â‘ meeting Will come to

fruition later this month. So too will the adoption of a Trade and Investment

Framework which will consolidate the region's collect ive commitment to consensusÃ¢Â‘

building in pursuit of trade and investment liberalisation. Japan has been an

important partner with us from the ouls~l in ~II uf tt1is You share, I know , our vlston

of APEC 's long term potential to promote economic integration In the Asia Pacific,  end we look forward to you to make an energetic commitment to realising that

vision.

It is particularly important that we continue to empr1aoio the importance of Asia

Pacific-wide economic cooperation, given the emergence of new free trade

arrangements involving North America and the ASEAN region respectively. These

developments in sub-regions of major economic importance for both Australia and

Japan certainly may_ work. in a way that is genuinely trade creating, and offer

opportunitie~ to us, but we need lo slay <:~1~1 t to tr1e possible risks and

disadvantages for countries like us of arrangements of this kind. It is essential,

more generally, that we both promote arrangements that encompass economies on

both sides of the Pacific and do not encourage any which may tend to drive wedges

between Asia Pacific countries.

We in Australia have watched with a good deal of interest the conclusion earlier this  year of the United States-Japan Fr~mework Agreement for a New Economic

Padnership. TtÃ¢Â‘ te ste:~lJility of your bilateral relationship has major implications for the

global and regional economies and not least for Australia. We have welcomed the

commitment of both parties to pursue bilateral trade relations on a most favoured

nation consistent basis, and without resort to managed trade policies _

Bilateral Relations

In the more than four decades since the San Francisco Peace -'freaty, Australia and

Japan have been very successful in put~ing the wartime past behind us. We have

no wish whatever to relive that past, but nonetheless we do think it is helpful - for

Japan's bilateral relations throughout the region -for there to be strong statements

of regret for past acts of aggression, like those recently made by Prime Minister  Hosokawa and by you, Foreign Minister Hata, and also for steps to be taken to

ensure that the lessons of the past are learned by eact1 new generation.

Since the 1950::; we have both benefited profoundly from fundamental economic

complementarities - your need forÃ¢Â‘ commodities and o~.;rs for manufactures. But we

have also nov.' moved far beyond this limited trading structure. Economic links have

been substantially uivtlr ~ifitld through extensive Japanese Investment in Australia,

the growing expert of Australian processed products and elaborately-transforrned

manufactures to Japan, collaboration in science and technology and the

development of a vast trade in services, particularly tourism and education.

Political and security ties have also developed to the point where our two countries

are regular interlocutors in many different forums. Our co-operation has broadened

out from . its Western-alliance base to include now common interests as good

international citizens in promoting disarmament, peace-keeping, security dialogues

and vorious humonitE~rian causes .

Along wilh lhese fundarr1ental developments in the economic and political areas has

gone a large-scale effort to promote people-to-people exchanges betw~en our two

countries in the spheres of education, academia , culture, journalism and so on.

The Celebrate Australia promotion, to be .launched this week in the graqious

presence of their Imperial Highnesses the Crown Prince and Princess of Japan, is a

$40 million effort to bring an even better understanding of Australia and its

achievements to Japan - one that recognise~. in particular, that we are not just a

collection of mines. farms and tourist beaches, but a sophisticated, cosmopolitan

culture and a highly-sophisticated manufacturing and service providing economy .

We will be delivering message lflis mor 1ll1 witt1 1 oo events in 30 Japanese cities,

covering the arts, business, education, tect1no!ogy, food, wine and sport.

As we move towards the 21st century, the challenge for the Australian-Japanese

partnership is to continue to move forward. Let me spell out, finally, some of the

areas where we think further movement is both possible and desirable:

I mentioned before Australia's program of esonomic r-eform and of

intc,-nationalising our economy. Your new government in ToKyo r.ow

foreshadows a domestic reform program of similar proportions. If such a

reform program were to embrace, in particular, measures to break down

residual barriers to import:s in foodstuffs , services and procurements. It

would also strengthen Japan's international and regional credentials as an

economic Ieeder. and it would do much to elin-.inate rer11~ir1ing frictions in the

Australia-J~pan economic relationship.

Australia is concerned to diversify our trade, and in particular to increase the

share of manufactures and high-tech products in our exports to Japan.

Increased Japanese investment in Australia in these areas can play a major

pC':lrt in the further broadening of our economy.

The Australia-Japan relationship will also benefit from further effective action

on the part of Japan working for trade liberalisation and increased economic

interdependence throughout the Asia Pacific region through APEC and other

multil;;;tt0ral processes.

Changes in tile international and regional strategic situation will also tend to

reinforce shared interests between Australia and Japan. Australia has long

made clear that it would like to see a more active Japanese role in global and

regional affairs , and we are pleased that this is now being translated into

positive action in the pace-keeping sphere. Co-operation in arms control,

threat reduclion and pt:<::~c;e-keeping issues and in the sphere of non-military

threats to security through aid, refugee, drug, health, environmentai and

counter-terrorism programs, will all be fertile areas for advancing our

partnership into the 21st century.

We can never pay too much attention to people-to-people contacts and public  diplomC'.lcy. Strong support by governmenl::;, bus in e~~ ortu in~titutions in both

countries will be essential to cementing the educational, academic,

professiona! and cultural contacts which we will need to complement our

growing economic end political links.

7

As we go through our ~gerida today, I ~uggest that we be~r clo:5ely in mind how we

can build further on our traditional strengths in the ecor"'!Ofnic area, our already solid

political relation~hip and our already substantial contacts in the non-governmental

area.

Our broader objective should be the establishment by the 21st century of a bilateral  relationship of such confidence and substance that it is a major lynch-pin in the

emergence of a stronger and more cohesive, secure and prosperous Asia Pacific

community.
