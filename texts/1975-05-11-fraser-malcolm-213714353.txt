STATEMENT FROM THE HON. MALCOLM FRASER, MP , LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION

THE VIETNAMESE REFUGEES

The Prime Minister's evasions over Australia's inhumane response to the  tragedy of Vietnam must be brought to an e n d ,  now that he is returning  to Australia.

If the Prime Minister is not willing to tell the people what he is doing,   the Opposition will demand it of him in Parliament. .

There are reports that a fleet of ships has left Singapore for Australia  with about 1,000 people on board who hope for entry.

From Washington it is reported that the Prime Minister told the United  States'  President that Australia would take about half the number of  refugees as were allowed in to Canada, and that an American official  interpreted this as meaning a total of about 1,500 people.'

Having evaded any real effort to help the Vietnamese refugees before he  left for Jamaica, the Prime Minister now appears to be hiding behind  other countries and behind the United Nations. .

I am certain that the Australian people would not want their compassion  and concern to be measured in this way, and to be made dependent on  decisions in Canada. .  Â·

Meanwhile those Vietnamese for whom Australia has a special responsibility  because they served us, or are related to Vietnamese in Australia, have  been abandoned. Ã¢ÂÂ

The reports that have been brought out of Cambodia by journalists who  were able to leave the French embassy in Phnom Penh paint a horrifying  picture of what is happening under the new communist regime.

Those Australians and Australian residents with friends, relatives and love<  ones in Vietnam can only hope that the madness of Cambodia does not spread  to Vietnam. Â·  Â·

If that occurs, then the Prime Minister may have passed a sentence of  death, on persons who could be in Australia with their ...relatives or friends,   and instead who were abandoned .to their fate.
