Ruddock wrong to target refugees

Â

The Australian Democrats expressed strong concern at Minister Ruddock’s 
announcement today of tough new measur es against asylum-seekers.

Â

“While we support measures to halt the trade in 
people-trafficking, these initiatives target the victims, not the traffickers,” 
said Senator Andrew Bartlett, the Australian Democrats’ spokesperson 
on immigration and multiculturalism.

Â

“This increased focus on treating refugees as “temporary 
visitors” is looking more and more like a One Nation policy.”

Â

Senator Bartlett said the Minister’s attack on refugees 
was appalling following, as it does, so closely on National Refugee 
Week.

Â

“The Ministers comments about refugees denigrates 
the contribution refugees make to Australia and is appalling considering 
only a week ago we celebrated this contribution with National Refugee 
Week.

Â

“The Minister has also made a blatant discriminatory 
attack on a particular section of our ethnic community claiming they 
are implicit in organising illegal immigrants to enter Australia,” 
said Senator Bartlett.

Â

“Comments which target particular groups and allege 
that they are somehow involved in obtaining refugee visas illegally, 
are inflammatory and dangerous. The fact that people risk their lives 
and livelihood to come to Australia using any means possible is an indicator 
of how desperate people are.

Â

‘The Minister’s comments confirm the need for 
the Refugee Review Tribunal to be an independent body. It is there to 
ensure that the decisions made by the Department are not influenced 
by the Government agendas. This government has repeatedly acted against 
its own policy, which claims to be non-discriminatory in all areas of 
visa allocation and is now targeting the most needy, refugees.

Â

“The Minister has adopted the economic bottom line 
in assessing all areas of immigration and multiculturalism and has forgotten 
Australia’s humanitarian obligations. Australia has an international 
obligation to process refugees applications in a non-discriminatory 
manner,” he said.

Â

“It is delays in migration applications due to inadequate 
staffing, lengthy processing and changes made to the way visas are granted, 
that are causing people to fall back on claiming asylum and increasing 
the costs to the government.

Â

“If the Minister is serious about saving money through 
increased efficiency he should stop relying on legislation and consider 
staffing his departments and overseas Embassies adequately so people 
can be processed in an efficient manner,” Senator Bartlett concluded.
