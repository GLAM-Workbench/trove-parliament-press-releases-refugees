BUDGET 2011 - CHANNEL 9 - LAURIE OAKES

10TH MAY 2011

LAURIE OAKES:

Mr Hockey, welcome to the programme.

JOE HOCKEY:

Thanks Laurie.

LAURIE OAKES:

Mr Swan budgeted for a $3.5 billion surplus in two years. He’s given us a pretty responsible budget, hasn’t he?

JOE HOCKEY:

Well, the budget deficit is getting bigger this year. The Government’s borrowing $135 million a day. The budget  deficit is getting bigger next year, $10 billion bigger and that’s when economic growth is getting stronger and  unemployment is falling. He expects us to believe that in the third year he will deliver a modest budget surplus  and he hasn’t got the carbon tax in the budget, which effects everything - revenue, expenditure, inflation,  everything.

LAURIE OAKES:

But that’s supposed to be revenue neutral.

JOE HOCKEY:

Well it will affect inflation, it will affect employment numbers, what’s more Laurie, it’s based on continued growth  out of China, a four per cent drop, just four per cent in the terms of trade wipes out that surplus.

LAURIE OAKES:

So, do you think Treasury has made up the figure? Is that what you’re saying?

JOE HOCKEY:

No, no. Treasury in fact identifies in its sensitivity indicator that a four per cent drop in the terms of trade will wipe  out that budget surplus. Now the Government has always been promising to deliver a surplus. Each year it does  this, sure, but the deficit is getting bigger and the debt is getting bigger. Wayne Swan just described on radio the  debt as tiny. It has gone from $94 billion…

LAURIE OAKES:

Well, it’s tiny compared with other countries.

JOE HOCKEY:

But we should not be compared to those countries because they’re not the ones that are driving our economy;  China and India and others are driving our economy. We’re part of the developing world, not part of the  developed world, in the sense of driving our economy. He compares us to the worst when we should be  compared to the best and therefore when he describes our debt as tiny, when it now has gone from $94 billion in  net terms to $107 in net terms, when Australians are going to have to pay $18 million a day of interest for the  next four years and growing, when he describes it as tiny it shows how indifferent he is to the challenges of the  modern budget.

LAURIE OAKES:

Well, he’s budgeted for $22 billion in savings, $14 billion in spending cuts. Are you at least conceding that that is  responsible?

JOE HOCKEY:

Well it’s good that they are making the hard decisions about spending cuts but the Commonwealth public service  has increased by 20, 000 employees since Labor came to office and it’s going to grow by a further 1000  employees this year alone in Canberra. The Government now has $1.7 billion of extra money allocated over four  years to deal with the boats and the Government has just announced another $200 million blow out in the  computers in schools programme which means it’s a $1.4 billion blow out. So, the waste is measured in the  billions. The savings seem to be in the millions.

LAURIE OAKES:

But the budget papers show that the real government spending will only increase by an average of one per cent a  year over the forward estimates.

JOE HOCKEY:

But it keeps growing.

LAURIE OAKES:

I mean, that is tiny…

JOE HOCKEY:

But it’s growing. You see? It’s coming off a very high base, Laurie and if you do not reduce your expenditure you  can never hope to get the budget under control. They are banking everything, they’re betting the entire casino,  they’re betting it on an increase in revenues coming out of China and if there’s a slight movement out of that it’s  all gone.

LAURIE OAKES:

Will the Coalition vote for the spending cuts in this budget?

JOE HOCKEY:

Well, we’ll go through them bit by bit. What was most alarming tonight, which hasn’t been properly reported, is  that a family on $45,000 a year receiving the family tax benefit is about to have a real reduction in their payments.

LAURIE OAKES:

Well, it’s not a reduction in their payments, they just won’t get an increase.

JOE HOCKEY:

Well, because inflation’s going up, Laurie. It is a real reduction. It’s a real reduction against inflation and this is  what is on the forefront of Australians’ minds - cost of living. This is the first budget in eight years with no tax cuts.  It’s the first budget that is delivering huge tax increases - the carbon tax, the mining tax, the flood tax.

LAURIE OAKES:

But you can’t make cuts without [inaudible]

JOE HOCKEY:

No.

LAURIE OAKES:

And you’re demanding tougher cuts.

JOE HOCKEY:

Yes, I mean, for example, we would cut 12,000 public servants out of Canberra as a starting point and that still  means the public service is 8000 bigger than what we left it at.

LAURIE OAKES:

Those public servants haven’t got of cost of living problems?

JOE HOCKEY:

Well they do, but you know what? Canberra has got a unemployment rate of two and a half per cent. They’ve got  a chance of rebuilding but for the rest of Australia that is a significant cost for them. The blowout in the border  protection budget, I mean that has an impact on Australians.

LAURIE OAKES:

But I was surprised, earlier, to see that you’re even opposing the budget measure to phase out the dependent  spouse tax offset. Why, why should this taxpayer subsidise someone to stay at home rather than go to work?

JOE HOCKEY:

Well, form our perspective, now is not the time to cut payments to families.

LAURIE OAKES:

But we’re talking about a dependent spouse, not a mother or a father.

JOE HOCKEY:

Yeah well we will assess these on a case-by-case basis. The point I was making and continue to make, Laurie, is  now is not the time to make life harder for Australian families. You’ve got to make it easier.

LAURIE OAKES:

You want tougher cuts but now’s not the time to make life harder? You can’t have it both ways.

JOE HOCKEY:

The tougher cuts that I’ve identified include 12,000 public servants and not spending so much on border  protection because you don’t need to. They’re the sorts of cuts that are essential.

LAURIE OAKES:

And can you get enough out of that to get the budget back into surplus a year ahead of the Government?

JOE HOCKEY:

No, well I mean that’s gone obviously because this Government has blown the budget next year. The budget  deficit next year has gone from $12 billion to $22 billion, Laurie. It’s getting worse not better.

LAURIE OAKES:

So you now couldn’t beat the Government?

JOE HOCKEY:

Well, of course you couldn’t. But I don’t think the Government will ever deliver a budget surplus, because every  time they’ve promised a surplus the deficit and debt gets bigger and larger.

LAURIE OAKES:

What about the other key thing in the Budget, the problem with a shortage of workers? Do you think that the  measures in the Budget will solve that problem?

JOE HOCKEY:

I think it’s a step forward, we’re not ruling out support for that. We are supportive of welfare to work measures but  we want to see the detail. There seems to be a lot of trials and pilot programmes.

LAURIE OAKES:

You say that the Budget has done nothing to ease cost of living pressures. What should it have done there?

JOE HOCKEY:

Well, the starting point is that - not just this year but in previous years - the Government shouldn’t have spent so  much money. If it hadn’t of spent so much money…

LAURIE OAKES:

But we can’t rewrite history. We’re here now.

JOE HOCKEY:

Well, you can rewrite history if you were actually writing it at the time, and I’d say to you as we said before we  opposed some of the stimulus because it was wasteful, $900 cheques. The Government’s spending $110  million…



LAURIE OAKES:

But if the independents change sides tomorrow, you find yourself in government, what would you do?

JOE HOCKEY:

Well, Laurie, we’ve outlined that. We outlined $50 billion of cuts, including cutting 12,000 public servants.



LAURIE OAKES:

The Treasury blew those out of the water.

JOE HOCKEY:

No, they didn’t. That’s wrong.

LAURIE OAKES:

Well, the certainly discredited quite a few of them.

JOE HOCKEY:

No, they didn’t actually. In fact some of them they’ve picked up in this Budget and that’s the irony of it, Laurie.  We’re the ones that are offering the Government all the cuts. They’re expecting us to show them how to get back  to surplus. They’re not doing it themselves.

LAURIE OAKES:

Will this budget focus attention on the economy and take attention away from the carbon tax and asylum  seekers?

JOE HOCKEY:

No, because it’s all interlinked. The competence of the Government is reflected in their incompetence in the  carbon tax.

LAURIE OAKES:

So is there anything about this that you like?

JOE HOCKEY:

The mental health initiative is good, but it appears to be only $583 million in new money. But other than that,  Laurie, it’s not going to ease the burden of families. It’s not going to ease the cost of living pressures and Wayne  Swan is now going to own the interest rate increases because he’s done nothing before today on capacity issues  in the economy and he’s done nothing to ease the burden of cost of living for everyday Australians.

LAURIE OAKES:

Joe Hockey, we thank you.   JOE HOCKEY:  Thanks Laurie.
