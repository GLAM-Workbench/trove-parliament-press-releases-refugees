Behaviour protocols for refugees, Liberal Party  fear mongering: Greens

The Australian Greens have labelled the Immigration Minister’s Code of Behaviour for refugees on  bridging visas a distasteful political stunt and will move to disallow the legislative instrument that  underpins it.

“This is a move straight from the Liberal Party handbook on fear mongering and hysteria,” the  Greens’ Immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.

“We have behaviour protocols, they’re called Australian law and they should apply to everyone  equally.

“This is clear discrimination against a specific group of people and it needs to be called out for what  it is.

“Having one set of rules for some people and a different set of rules for others offends the very  ideals of a fair and decent democratic society.

“The Greens will move to disallow this legislative instrument at the first opportunity.

“It is regrettable that we have a government in Australia that is more interested in vilifying refugees  who are fleeing from war and persecution than giving them the safety that they need.”
