PRESS RELEASE ALAN CADMAN M.P.   SHADOW MINISTER FOR   IMMIGRATION & ETHNIC   AFFAIRS

REFUGEE PROGRAMME

My comments on "The World Today" simply mean that I believe  there should be more attention given to Indo-Chinese refugees  within the same sized refugee programme.

I have not called for an increase in the total number of  refugees.

I have said this before and there is nothing new in my  remarks.

Our Policy says that Australia has an outstanding record in  fulfilling its international humanitarian commitments within  the world-wide community.

We will continue to offer settlement opportunities and meet  our responsibilities once a programme is commenced. However,  refugee settlement will form a flexible and separate  programme.
