E &O E - PROOF ONLY



JOURNALIST: Joining us this morning for our first political debate of the year, Finance  Minister Penny Wong and Shadow Immigration Minister Scott Morrison. Firstly, thank you  very much both for joining us in the studio.

Penny first of all with the development in Egypt this morning, what’s our Government’s  response to the decision by Mubarak to hold onto power?

WONG: Well it’s obviously a very concerning situation in Egypt. We are urging democracy.  We are urging a transition that is orderly and in which the Egyptian people have the  opportunity to express their views. But our first thoughts are obviously to hope that we don’t  see the violence that we have seen; that we see a peaceful and orderly transition. It’s  obviously a very difficult situation. I understand the Prime Minister is giving a press  conference shortly so hopefully she’ll have more to say on this.

JOURNALIST: They’re just live pictures we are seeing now out of Liberation Square in  Cairo. Things are set to become very difficult.

Alright onto the local political agenda. Scott Morrison firstly to you. How did the Opposition  get itself into such a mess with this flood levy or its response to it? There have been so  many divisions now appearing in the Party. Instead of just saying yes we agree with it, all  these things that have come up - with you also yourself have decided to try to pull out of  funding for schools in Indonesia - showing massive divisions within the Party.

SCOTT MORRISON: Well tough decisions always bring on fierce debate. We’ve had some  fierce debate and we’ve made some tough decisions. Our decision is this. We think this  Government can’t control its spending and when they keep running out of money they keep  going back to tax us. And we’re saying to the Government quite clearly this is not  something that’s going to be on as far as the Opposition is concerned. Savings are  possible. We first offered to sit down with the Prime Minister and say let’s sit down and talk

about some savings. She didn’t want to do that. We put our money where our mouth was.  And if she believes those cuts aren’t doable and she would prefer a tax, that’s what she’s  saying to the Australian people. She wants a tax. We’re saying other opportunities are  possible.

JOURNALIST: Minister, Andrew Wilkie is saying he can’t understand why you just didn’t let  the budget run out for another twelve months.

WONG: We are committed to bringing the budget back to surplus and we think there are  very strong economic reasons for that.

The reality is, Scott’s package - the floods package that Tony Abbott wants to put in place -  doesn’t even have the support of his deputy leader. I mean, he says that tough decisions  need to be made but he can’t even convince his shadow cabinet that this is the right tough  decision.

In terms of our package, let’s remember two-thirds of this $5.6 billion package to rebuild  Queensland and other flood-affected parts of Australia - two-thirds of it is funded by cuts to  the budget, cuts to Government spending. One-third is funded by a modest levy that people  who earn over $50,000 a year will pay a small proportion of. I mean, 60 per cent of  taxpayers will pay less than $1 a week.

JOURNALIST: If it’s only $1.8 billon why not raise it from other avenues rather than  causing this political turmoil?

WONG: We’re focused on giving Queenslanders and people in other parts of Australia the  security they need to rebuild their lives, their homes, their communities.

MORRISON: But Penny there’s no disagreement about the expenditure. There’s no  disagreement about supporting Queensland floods. It’s how you’re going to raise the  money.

WONG: And we know we are going into a budget, as per your first question, where we will  have to make tough decisions. This is a very large natural disaster. Probably the most  economically costly natural disaster Australia has seen. A modest levy for a third of the  cost, two-thirds of the cost funded by spending cuts. A very sensible package. We should  just get on and pass it. We shouldn’t be playing the sort of procedural games we’ve seen  from the Opposition.

JOURNALIST: But you’re going to. You’ve got to convince the independents to come on  board. They’re going to have their hands out for something. How are you going to cope with  that? Whether it may be this easy eligibility for Youth Allowance for instance?

WONG: That’s a different issue. But certainly on the independents - we’ll do what we’ve  done, what we did on the NBN bill, on the Telstra bill. And that is to keep talking to them.  We think this is a good package. We obviously have to negotiate our passage on this  legislation.

JOURNALIST: More than negotiate; it means watering it down.

WONG: We’ll see, we’ll see what happens on that front.

JOURNALIST: Scott Morrison, there’s nothing more dangerous for a Liberal leader than  have all his parliamentary MPs standing behind him telling him that his position is rock solid  as has been shown by the recent past. Tony Abbott has all of his MPs standing behind him,  including his deputy leader, very clearly telling him that his position is rock solid. How rock  solid is it going to be?

MORRISON: There was a very enthusiastic queue of people lining up to support Tony as  there always is. Why? Because Tony has taken our party -

JOURNALIST: Well some past leaders who had the same support aren’t there to tell their  story today.

MORRISON: Tony has taken our party to an incredible place in such a short period of time.  And he’s done that by being decisive. He’s done that by showing clear leadership and  direction. And I think that’s been shown again, that he’s standing up for clear principles. Our  party being a party of lower taxes, our party being a party of saying we don’t want to go  down the road of exorbitant spending, and we want to keep those things under control. And  we’ve acted in accordance with those principles. The Government is taking the view to tax.  The carbon tax is coming as Penny knows, we’ve got the mining tax which is on its way and  we’ve also got the flood tax. And we said in Parliament yesterday, with a $290 million  blowout in their asylum seeker budget yesterday, well, where’s the boat tax?

WONG: Well, come on. First off, you always try and link these things. You know mandatory  detention is expensive, it was expensive under you, you spent $400 million on Christmas  Island.

MORRISON: You spend $100 million a year in this budget -

WONG: I listened to you Scott, I listened to you. $400 million on Christmas Island, around  $300 million on the Pacific Solution. I mean mandatory detention is expensive.

But if you want to talk about fiscal responsibility - which I’m happy to talk about - you  yesterday, if I may finish, I did let you finish...

MORRISON: You raised Penny, how much we did spend on the Pacific Solution and your  colleagues have done the same. What you ask for from the Parliament yesterday was more  than we spent on the Pacific Solution, and that was just your budget blowout.

WONG: Well that’s actually not true. If you want to talk about fiscal responsibility. Yesterday  in the Parliament your Senators voted for legislation which would, if it were ever passed,  would put $300 million plus on the budget with no offsetting savings.

MORRISON: Our savings are there. We announced them before the election.

WONG: Yes, the $10.6 billion black hole -

MORRISON: We announced our savings, you can take any one you like Penny.

WONG: (laughs) So you cannot - Scott, come on. I did listen to you.

MORRISON: Well you’re asking questions!

WONG: Let me finish, come on. Fair cop here. You supported legislation that will impose  $300 million on the budget, were it ever to be to be passed without offsetting savings.

MORRISON: That’s not true.

WONG: You cannot come in and lecture people about being fiscally responsible when you  keep putting up things that have a cost without giving up savings.

MORRISON: The savings were announced before the election Penny. They’re there.

WONG: The $10.6 billion black hole.

MORRISON: Take your pick, it’s a smorgasboard of savings.

WONG: A $10.6 billion black hole that was found by Treasury and Finance.

MORRISON: You don’t want to find them! We’re offering them to you.

WONG: (laughs) It’s not me saying that! It’s Treasury and Finance.

MORRISON: You rejected our savings.

JOURNALIST: Minister, on Sunday the Premiers gather in Canberra. Are you about to  dump Kevin Rudd’s hospital plan and in other words, abandon a core Labor promise to fix  hospitals?

WONG: The Labor promise is to deal with this enormous health problem that we have  coming.

JOURNALIST: So you’re going to dump Kevin Rudd’s package?

WONG: And the problem we have, as you probably know, is that health costs are rising.  Unless we do something, health costs will subsume too much, or all in the medium-term of  the states’ budgets. So we have to do something about health. Now we’re interested in an  outcome; an outcome that’s good for patients and that deals with this health funding  problem that has been around for years. That was identified under the Howard Government  and will be with us for some time. Obviously, there’s a lot of negotiation occurring but we’ll  be very focused on how do we meet this challenge, and how do we do what’s best for  patients.

JOURNALIST: So Kevin Rudd’s package will be dumped?

WONG: I will leave the negotiations to the Prime Minister. The problem is one that does  need to be addressed and we’re committed to addressing it in a way that deals with the  needs of patients. But obviously we’re not going to be writing any blank cheque. We’re very

5



clear about that. This is a problem that needs to be resolved by the Premiers and the Prime  Minister.

JOURNALIST: Are they on the right track?

MORRISON: The gap between announcement and delivery on health for this Government  is going down the same road that we’ve in New South Wales. We’re sitting in Sydney today,  the people of NSW have already worked out that gap about Labor in New South Wales, and  I’m sure they’re seeing the same thing now from the Federal Government on health.

JOURNALIST: Minister Penny Wong, thank you very much for coming in. Scott Morrison,  always a pleasure to have both of you on the program. Thank you very much indeed.

WONG: Nice to be with you.
