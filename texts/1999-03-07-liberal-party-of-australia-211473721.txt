TAXPAYER FOOTS RISING ASYLUM-SEEKER LITIGATION 
COSTS

Â

Â

The Minister for immigration end Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock, 
today predicted the  Australian taxpayer would be forced to pay 
a staggering $20 million in litigation costs by the year 2002 if the 
Senate failed to pass the Judicial Review Bill.

Â

Mr Ruddock said 70 per cent of total litigation costs 
related to people whose refugee claims had been rejected and who then 
sought recourse through the courts. The remaining 30 per cent of litigation 
costs relate to all other immigration matters.

Â

“Any single Protection Visa claimant whose application 
is refused who then applies to the Refugee Review Tribunal, appeals 
to the Federal Court, has one associated intervention request, and is 
then located, detained and removed from Australia, costs the taxpayer 
a minimum of $20,500”.

Â

The $20,500 cost to Australian taxpayers include:

Â

Â· Â $1,900 for Departmental processing of the application.

Â· Â $1,800 
RRT processing costs.

Â· Â $9,800 
in defence of RRT decision in the Federal Court.

Â· Â $7,000 
to locate, detain and remove a failed applicant from Australia.

Â

These figures show the extent to which Australia’s legal  
system is being abused by people who have no right to be here,” Mr 
Ruddock said.

Â

"Litigation costs are escalating as people repeatedly 
seek to have their negative protection visa decisions overturned.

Â

“In 1995, litigation costs alone totalled $6 million. 
By the end of 1999 they are expected to reach $13 million, and by the 
year 2002, they could reach as high as $20 million”.

Â

Mr Ruddock said that since 1993-94, the number of 
new refugee related applications to the Courts jumped dramatically from 
53 a year, to 470 last year. This figure is expected to reach 500 by 
the end of 1999.

Â

These frequently vexatious actions are clogging Australia’s 
judicial system to the point that there are now 1,100 unresolved cases 
before our courts. Based on Current estimates, a staggering 2,000 cases 
could be facing resolution by 2002".

Â

“In addition to litigation costs, there are other 
significant costs borne by the Australian community in relation to Protection 
Visa claimants.

Â

“In I 997-98 the Department provided $11 million 
to some 1,050 Protection Visa claimants through the Asylum Seeker Assistance 
Scheme, to cover accommodation, health and food costs for those without 
the necessary funds.

Â

“Failed Protection Visa applicants also owe Australia 
almost $2.8 million in $1,000 Refugee Review Tribunal post-decision 
fees, payable when the Department’sÂ  primary division has been 
confirmed. Clearly, large numbers protection claimants are choosing 
to thumb their nose at the laws of this country”.

Â

Mr Ruddock said the location of overstayers, a large 
number of who are failedÂ  asylum-seekers, imposed yet more costs 
on the Australian taxpayer.

Â

“In 1997-98, around 80 per cent of the Department’s $50 million 
compliance budgetÂ  was spent on locating, detaining and removing 
failed PV applic ants and unauthorised arrivals from Australia.

Â

“Tellingly, of the total number of people unlawfully 
in Australia, over 5,000 are failed Protection Visa claimants living 
in the country illegally".

Â

Mr Ruddock said the fairness and credibility of Australia’s 
refugee determination process is reflected by the fact that of the 6,506 
cases the Refugee Review Tribunal looked at in 1997-98, the Tribunal 
upheld 90 per cent of the Department’s decisions.

Â

“These figures demonstrate that in many cases, a 
review is sought merely as a delaying tactic. Unfortunately, these delaying 
tactics mean Australians find it harder to gain access to their own 
courts and to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.

Â

“These circumstances only serve to highlight the 
need for the Government’s planned reforms to limit judicial review 
by Introducing a privative clause.

Â

“The Bills currently before the Senate are legitimate 
and measured responses to very real problems.

Â

“The Judicial Review Bill alms to reduce the growing 
cost and Incidence of migration litigation and the consequent delays 
in removing non-citizens with no right to remain In Australia.

Â

“This Government takes Australia’s international obligations for 
the resettlement of genuine refugees very seriously, and our refugee 
determination process is recognised by the UNHCR as one of the best 
in the world.

Â

“However, the facts show that the syst em is being manipulated 
as part of a delaying tactic. I am not prepared to put up with it any 
longer, and neither should the Australian public.”
