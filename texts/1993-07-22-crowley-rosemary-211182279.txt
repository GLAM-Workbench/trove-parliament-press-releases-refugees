\

International Year. of the Family  Australian Families

In June 1992 there were 4,586 ,800 Australian families (ABS).

Marital Status

AUSTRALIA  19 94

Marriage levels remain high, despite a 20 per cent decline since 1966 . The major change in marriage  patterns is marriage at later ages . More than 80 per cent of today's young people want to marry and  expect their marriages to last.

60 per cent of people over the age of 15 .are married. Around three quarters of these are first  marriages.

85 per cent of Australian families are two parent families, just over half of which have dependent  children:

Divorce rates have increased significantly since the mid 60's. Around 35 per cent of marriages in  Australia currently end in divorce.

Sole parent families represented 9 per cent of all Australian families in 1992, an increase from 7.5 per cent  a decade ago . For almost 90 per cent of these families, women were the sole parent. The majority of sole  parent families (more than 80 per cent) are formed following separation, divorce and widowhood.

The Work Force

The movement of women into the work force has been one of the most important social changes in  recent years in Australia; from 35 per cent of married women in 1970 to 53 per cent in 1992 . This  movement has been particularly strong since 1984 , for mothers with dependent children in both two parent  and sole parent families. A significant number of employed mothers work part-time - 60 per cent of mothers  in two parent families and more than 40 per cent of sole mothers are employed part-time.

In 1991, both partners were employed in 53 per cent of two parent families w ith dependents , and 39  per cent of those without. '-

Of those sole parent families with children under 15 years. 4 7 per cent of sole mothers and 69 per cent  of sole fathers were employed .

Childcare

In November 1990, over one million fam ilies used childcare (preschools, day care, occasional care,  family and friends). The main reason given for using childcare was "work related", although families also  use childcare for a range of other family related purposes.

Ageing Population

The issue of aged care is becoming increasingly relevant. In 1987 there were 1. 7 million people aged  65 and over in Australia (1 0.7 per cent of the population). In 1991 , there were 1.9 million people aged 65 or  over (11 .3 per cent of the population) and by 2011, the number is expected to be 2.9 million people (13.5  per cent of the population).

37 per cent of people aged 65 and over who currently live in the community need some form of.help  from others, and this help is usually provided by family members .

*Dependents include 15-24 year olds who are studying.  Source: ASS and Australian Institute of Family Studies
