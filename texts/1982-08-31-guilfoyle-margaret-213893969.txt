PRESS  RELEASE NO.

STATEMENT BY THE ACTING TREASURER.  SENATOR THE HON. DAME MARGARET GUILFOYLE,  D.B.E.

LEBANON RELIEF APPEALS

The Government has decided to provide through the   gift provisions of the income tax law further assistance towards   the relief of suffering caused by the conflict in Lebanon.  This   assistance will supplement the $10m grant already allocated by

the Government.

Since the tragic consequences of the conflict have   become known,  a number of appeals have been established in   Australia to assist in alleviating the suffering caused to the   Lebanese, people.  These include the appeals conducted by the

Australian Aid for Lebanon Committee, the International Disaster   Emergencies Committee and the Lebanese Moslems Association.

To assist those and other similarly based appeals in   attracting support from the Australian community,  the Government   has decided to amend the income tax law to grant deductions for   gifts made to a public fund in Australia established and maintained

exclusively for the relief of refugees from,  or persons in, Lebanon who have been placed in necessitous circumstances as a   consequence of the conflict in Lebanon,  other than members of   the forces in that conflict.

The necessary amendments will be introduced in the   current sittings of Parliament and will authorise deductions   for gifts made during the 1981-82 and 1982-83 financial years.
