THE HON JOE HOCKEY MP

SHADOW TREASURER

DOORSTOP  PERTH  6 SEPTEMBER 2012

E&OE………………………………………………………………………………………

JOE HOCKEY:

The Australian Bureau of Statistics has released the latest unemployment data; whilst the  headline rate has come down for the nation, the numbers are heading in the wrong direction.  There has been an increase in the number of job losses - today there are 27,000 less jobs in  Australia than there was in May - about four months ago. There has been a substantial  winding back in workforce participation - that is disappointing as well.

I think the most disappointing statistic is 101,700 working days were lost due to industrial  disputes in the June Quarter. Over 100,000 job days were lost in the June Quarter because of  industrial disputes - that is the highest level since June 2004. This is the Government’s laws  at work, and this is on top of everything else the Government is doing.

Its policy incompetency is costing Australians their future, as recognised by the World  Economic Forum Global Competitiveness Report. It has identified that the Government -  through its incompetent policies - is making us less competitive in the world, not more

competitive. They make it harder and not easier. New taxes, new regulations at a rate of 11  every day, makes life harder for business and not easier - it makes it harder to employ people  into the future and not easier. I would just say to you - the fundamental point is this - we need  to get the country back on track, we need to give people hope. The only way to do that is to  get rid of the taxes like the carbon tax and the mining tax, to get rid of the regulation - which  is averaging 11 new regulations every day - and to give Australians hope that they will get  some of the benefit of all their hard work.

JOURNALIST:

The unemployment rate did still come down though, are you just being negative again?

JOE HOCKEY:

No. What do you mean ‘again’? We are always positive. I would just say to you, you have  got to look at the underlying figures - over 27,000 jobs lost since May, it is hugely  disappointing. It is the trends -  figures go up and down month to month, I rarely actually  comment on the unemployment rate month to month because it is quite a volatile series, but  now there is an emerging trend, and that is disappointing. What is emerging is a terrible trend  in relation to industrial disputes. We now have got more strike days lost than any time since  2004. That is unacceptable at a time when holding onto your job is hugely important.

JOURNALIST:

How does the number of hours or days lost to industrial disputes compare to previous  quarters?

JOE HOCKEY:

It is what I just said, this is the worst period since June of 2004.

JOURNALIST:

What about the quarters before that?

JOE HOCKEY:

I haven’t gone back to 1942.

JOURNALIST:

But are you picking one quarter and saying that it is representative of things, even if it doesn’t  compare?

JOE HOCKEY:

Quarters are a more reliable measure of information than month to month figures, as I just  said. Therefore, when you consider quarterly outcomes and the level of industrial disputation  in this last quarter compared with all the quarters back, you would say it is the highest level  of industrial disputation since June of 2004. That is an indictment of where things are  heading. Look at the strikes at various places around the country - look at the industrial  disputation in the streets of Melbourne. Have a look at that and you can directly link it back  to Government policy - the fact that they haven’t got an Australian Building and  Construction Commission, which is a strong policeman on the beat with the construction  industry. That level of industrial disputation has risen under Labor to such a degree that we  now have the worst number of days lost to strikes since 2004 - and it was a very different  economic environment then. We cannot afford to have this level of industrial disputation.

JOURNALIST:

I have a foreign investment question, in light of Cubbie Station, do you think the current  foreign investment laws are strong enough to deal with these investments by state-owned  companies?

JOE HOCKEY:

Well, any investment from a state owned enterprise automatically triggers an alert to the  Foreign Investment Review Board who then investigates the matter - that is not changing  under us, that is the existing rule. We released a discussion paper for public comment on  foreign investment in agricultural businesses and agriculture more generally. So far we have  received hardly any submissions; I would encourage people to put in submissions to respond  to our reduction in the threshold limits for FIRB approval. Frankly, you cannot afford to have  a Treasurer who is sneaky in dealing with these sorts of issues and when Wayne Swan simply  releases a two page statement about Cubbie Station on late Friday afternoon to avoid proper  public scrutiny - all it did was raise issues. Unfortunately, that is the way this Government  operates.

JOURNALIST:

Is there an irreconcilable split between the Nationals and the Liberals over foreign  investment?

JOE HOCKEY:

No.

JOURNALIST:

Do you think their views on zonal taxation, for example, has the potential to damage the  Coalition’s economic credentials?

JOE HOCKEY:

No.

JOURNALIST:

You had better explain.

JOE HOCKEY:

I am just giving you the straight answers, I think that is better. [inaudible] Zonal taxation was  created at a time when people would be expected to move to parts of regional and remote  Australia for work. Now with fly-in, fly-out it is a very different paradigm. Whilst there are  advocates for increasing zonal tax rebates and so on, we are a very different nation today than  what we were when we started with zonal tax rebates.

JOURNALIST:

What do you make of Mr Turnbull’s comments last night?

JOE HOCKEY:

Well Mr Turnbull is entitled to his view. I see that he has heavily criticised the newspaper  that misinterpreted his views, and he is right to do so.

JOURNALIST:

Do you think there is too much of a focus on the carbon tax and asylum seekers in Question  Time?

JOE HOCKEY:

Look, the problem is, these are the issues that the Australian people are most concerned  about. We have a responsibility to raise those issues. The matters would not have dominated  Question Time if the government had solved the problems. Instead we still have policy on the  run from the government in relation to the carbon tax. In the last few weeks this Government  undermined its own carbon tax policy by linking Australia's carbon tax price to the European  economy. Why on god’s earth you would link anything to the European economy over the  next few years, I don't know, but this Government has managed to do it and make us more  vulnerable, and create greater volatility in relation to carbon pricing. Yesterday we had the  Government announce that it had given up trying to close down the so called ‘biggest  polluters’ and they are not going to lift a finger in relation to the matter into the future. So,  quite frankly, we are going to see the carbon price go up. Nicola Roxon said yesterday it is  going to be left to the market. Well that would suggest the carbon price would have to go up  to close down the so called biggest polluters or else they are not going to meet their targets. I  mean, this is a conga line of confusion on the carbon tax, matched by a conga line of  confusion on the mining tax and everything else this government does. So we are asking  legitimate questions. Does anyone really believe the carbon tax is settled? No. Does anyone  really believe that the asylum seeker is settled? No. And that's why we ask the questions.

JOURNALIST:

Mr Turnbull decried the level of public debate. Now he can put his words together pretty well  and he's only asked one question in question time in 2012. Do you think that is fair?

JOE HOCKEY:

It was a good question.

JOURNALIST:

How many questions have you asked this year?

JOE HOCKEY:

Well, I’m the Shadow Treasurer. I cover everything from the Budget right through to the  everyday. Look, this is a beltway issue in Canberra. Can I tell you, it is irrelevant to the  mainstream. The mainstream of Australia wants us to deal with their issues and that is what  we do every day. We listen to people every day. I had 200 people turn out in Rockingham  yesterday afternoon for a community engagement.  I was up against a community cabinet that  apparently had 400 people. I thought that was pretty good. Rockingham is an area in distress  with over 30% youth unemployment. Frankly, we are out there engaging with people and  representing their views in Parliament. We are developing policies that are going to solve  their problems.

JOURNALIST:

A Christian group has come out to say that gay marriage is worse than smoking. Do you  agree?

JOE HOCKEY:

That gay marriage is worse than smoking? Well, I haven't heard that.

JOURNALIST:

That it is a greater health hazard.

JOE HOCKEY:

I'm not going to dignify that with a comment.

JOURNALIST:

How do think the Prime Minister has handled this issue, given the fact she cancelled her  appearance?

JOE HOCKEY:

She is entitled to do what she wants to do. Frankly, I don't see it as a good thing to disparage  anyone because of their lifestyle. I just think you have got to get on with life.

JOURNALIST:

Back on foreign investment. Can you, or should you, rein in Barnaby Joyce?

JOE HOCKEY:

Barnaby Joyce is entitled to his view. Everyone is entitled to a view, an opinion. And if you  live right next to Cubbie Station you are entitled to a view as well, just as if you lived right  next door to a major development in the middle of the city. People are entitled to a view. But  this is the Government's issue. It is the Government's issue of the Government's making. If

the Government wasn't so sinister in the way it went around dealing with the Cubbie Station  issue, then there wouldn't be such anxiety in the community.

JOURNALIST:

On the carbon tax, there is modelling out today that suggests some of the biggest emitters  could be billions of dollars better off under the tax.

JOE HOCKEY:

It wouldn't surprise me.

JOURNALIST:

Does that mean it isn't the wrecking ball through the economy that your party said it would  be?

JOE HOCKEY:

It means the general public will pay the bills rather than the biggest emitters in some cases.  The bottom line is the carbon tax is a tax on energy and because it is a tax on energy  everyone is going to have to pay for it. The people who use more energy in their daily life,  like manufacturers, are going to end up paying more of the carbon tax. It is as simple as that.  Today I met with some non-government organisations who have had a massive increase in  electricity bills, yet they are getting no compensation for the impact of the carbon tax. I do  note that the Reserve Bank, in its statement earlier this week, identified that when it comes to  the carbon tax it will be a python squeeze and it is going to keep hitting over the quarters.   That is what they said - they didn't use the term python squeeze - but that's what they said. It  is going to have a gradual impact on the community.  It is exactly the wrong time, with the  unemployment numbers today, with the National Accounts yesterday, it is exactly the wrong  time to impose new taxes on Australian enterprise. Thank you.
