THE HON JOE HOCKEY MP

SHADOW TREASURER

CHANNEL 7 -  SUNRISE  BIG GUNS OF POLITICS  FRIDAY, 23 NOVEMBER 2012



E&OE………………………………………………………………………………………

PRESENTER:

Let's get reaction now from our Big Guns of Politics, Environment Minister Tony Burke and  Shadow Treasurer Joe Hockey. Good morning to both of you. Tony, talk about he-said she-said. Nick Styant-Browne says there is no doubt that Ms Gillard was involved in helping to  facilitate the mortgage, so how can she keep denying any knowledge of it?

TONY BURKE:

We are talking about events that were nearly 20 years ago. Even the bloke making the  allegations last night - when Leigh Sales asked him - when they asked him, "When did you  first find out about it? Who told you?" He said he couldn't remember who first raised it. We  are talking about occasions that are so long ago. At the heart of it, there is no allegation  against the Prime Minister. We are talking about someone who was a lawyer, who may have  been involved in doing conveyancing for a client. Now, I mean, the amount of time that is  being spent on this, I am astonished by it. Even the person making the allegations, when it  came to "Which bits do you remember?" he couldn't remember when he was told.

PRESENTER:

It was brought up two years after she left, and she commented then.

TONY BURKE:

Yes, but Kochie, I wouldn't want to be in a situation where I am expected to remember every  fax that arrived in my office two years ago.

PRESENTER:

Joe, what do we do? Should there be a formal inquiry?

JOE HOCKEY:

Well, it certainly sounds like it. There are a number of issues here but the significant issue is:  is the Prime Minister now telling the truth? That is the fundamental point. These issues aren’t  being raised by us, they were first raised by Rob McClelland, the former Labor Attorney-General in the House of Representatives. It was first raised by the Labor Party and members  of the Labor Party. It has been former union officials who continue to raise the matter. It is a  former partner of Julia Gillard's (former law firm) who has raised the matter in the last 24  hours. People are raising these issues because they are saying that the Prime Minister's story  has been entirely inconsistent.

PRESENTER:

That's a point, Tony, isn't it? It is your mob internally that are fueling this and bringing it up.

TONY BURKE:

Look, the first speech that Joe referred to from Robert McClelland, that is true, the speech  was made. But I think it is a bit much to ignore the way Julie Bishop has been pursuing it in  question time and say it is nothing to do with the Liberal Party. If the Liberal Party had spent  as much time working up an education policy as they have spent on this, we would be able to  have conversations about, serious conversations about getting better education for schools.  We are dealing about allegations 17 years ago! This is the big issue you want to focus on.

JOE HOCKEY:

Let's get this right. A member of Julia Gillard's own caucus raises the issue in Parliament.  Former and current union officials raise the issue, publicly. A former partner of Slater &  Gordon raises the issue and the Coalition is expected to ignore it and disregard it, even  though it is on the front page of The Age - which is not a newspaper that is friendly to the  Coalition - and it is on the front page of newspapers around the country but it is all the  Liberals fault! It is all our fault? I mean, come on!

TONY BURKE:

No, Joe, in fairness, I began by acknowledging the original speech. I am not shying away.

JOE HOCKEY:

Well the Prime Minister has just got to answer the questions!

TONY BURKE:

I well let you go first but then I just want to say something.

PRESENTER:

No, let's get on to a modern-day issue.



TONY BURKE:

Good.

JOE HOCKEY:

No, hang on Kochie, it is a modern-day issue because it goes to whether the Prime Minister  has been telling the truth in the last few weeks.

PRESENTER:

You made your point and you are both throwing in red herrings about education - which are  completely irrelevant. So let's move onto something more relevant today. The Coalition  apparently wants asylum seekers allowed to stay in Australia while their asylum applications  are processed, to carry out community work in return for welfare payments. This is in  contrast to the government's new plan, which prevents them from working at all. What do  you reckon? Joe, will putting them to work discourage others from coming?

JOE HOCKEY:

The bottom line is, Kochie, firstly, there have been 30,000 illegal arrivals in the last five  years. In the six years prior to that, under us, there were 300. So there have been 30,000. Our  borders now are out of control. The Government has just announced that they are going to  repatriate those people onto mainland Australia and put them on welfare for up to five years  without work. Our strong view is, you don't start people in a country by putting them on  welfare for five years. We are saying put them on work for the dole. Get them to work and do  something, rather than just this idea that you are going to create this underclass of Australians  who go straight on to the dole and stay there for five years? Come on!

PRESENTER:

Tony, don't you have to give people something to do? Labor itself, MPs have said it could  lead to crime with nothing to do. We hear about boredom and the mental health repercussions  of that?

TONY BURKE:

I don't accept the crime argument. I don't think people not having a job is any argument that  turns them into criminals. If you commit a crime it doesn't matter what payscale you are on,  you get charged and you go to jail.

PRESENTER:

But it is better to keep people working, give them something to do. You have got to  acknowledge that?





TONY BURKE:

Kochie, as a general rule I respect that. But if the message goes out "Come to Australia  without a visa and you'll get a job while you're waiting and you will be able to earn money  while you're waiting" I'm not sure that is helpful.

PRESENTER:

No. Okay guys, we have run out of time. We have to leave it there. Have a great weekend.
