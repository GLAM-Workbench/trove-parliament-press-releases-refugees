SOVIET SHIP'S DESERTER GRANTED THREE MONTHS TEMPORARY

RESIDENCE

Soviet Ship’s officer, Viktor Dudko, who deserted the

vessel "Novopolotsk" on 8 December 1980, will, on application,

be granted a temporary entry permit for three months stay m

Australia, the Minister for immigration and Ethnic Affairs,

Mr Macphee, said today.

Mr Macphee said that he had received the report from the

Determination of Refugee Status (DORS) Committee which had

made its recommendation on the basis of a report on a

detailed interview with Mr Dudko. The committee had concluded

that Mr Dudko1s claims for refugee status had failed to

satisfy the definition in the United Nations Convention and

Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees.

"My decision to allow Mr Dudko to remain in Australia for

three months recognises the dilemma in which Mr Dudko now

finds himself. It will give him time to decide whether he

wishes to return to the Soviet Union, seek entry to another

country or make out a special case fox’ permanent x-esidence

in Australia", Mr Macphee said.

"Desertion by seamen from totalitarian states such as those

in Eastern Eui'ope creates difficult problems for countries

like Australia. On the one hand there is the need to retain

control over entity to, and residence, in, Australia. On the

other hand there are the humanitarian considerations that

flow from the situation that deserters such as Mr Dudko would

face if they were returned to their home countries” .

i

Mr Mncphee emphasised that Mr Dudko, if he applied for

permanent residence, would have to comply with the strict

policies for change of status. Hie three months temporary

entry permit would enable him to accept employment and,

if he decided to apply for permanent residence, would enable

necessary health and other checks to be undertaken.

BACKGROUND NOTE

The Determination of Refugee Status CoaiTiittee was established in late

197? foil coring the decision announced by the Govenw-nt earlier that

year to establish a refugee policy mechanism. The Ccmnittcc, which

lias an advisory role , considers applications from persons in Australia

seeking refugee status, The Committee emprises senior representatives

of the Departments of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (diairman),

Prime Minister end Cabinet, Foreign Affairs and Attorney^Gcncr-al1  s.

The Representative in Australia of the office of the United Nations

High Commissioner for Refugees atterds all meetings as an observer.

In considering its r ecannendations, the Committee considers the applicants'

claims against the requirements set out in the United Nations Convention on

the Status of Refugees (1951) and the associated Protocol (1967). Australia

has ratified the Convention and Protocol.  The operating and important

definition of a-refugee is as follows:

Article 1(A)(2) ‘

",. .cwing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of

race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or

political opinion; is outside the country of his nationality and is

unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the

protection of that country; or who, not having a nationality and being

outside the country of his former habitual residence is unable or,

owing to such fear, is unwilling to return to it."

' ?

In the consideration of Mr Dudko's claims for refugee status,

it was concluded that there w o e  no evidence that he had

experienced persecution in the Soviet Union prior to his

decision to desert his ship in Sydney on the morning of 8

December. Whiie it vans likely that he would be punished

for his actions,if he was returned to the Soviet Union,

it was not clear that such punishment would amount to

persecution within the terms of the Convention definition.
