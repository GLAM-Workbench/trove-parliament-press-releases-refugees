KEATING FINALLY SHOWS HIS HAND ON CHINESE STUDENTS ISSUE

Paul Keating has done another deal to try and save his own skin.  This time it's a deal on the future migrant status of around 20,000 Chinese students and their dependants.

When Mr Hawke made his original decision on this issue in 1990,  it was generally seen as an emotional, heat-of-the-moment  response that did not take adequate account of the wider

implications for the integrity of Australia's immigration  program.

Mr Keating has had the chance to take account of those realities.   He has portrayed himself as the man who will bring a hard-headed,  non-emotional perspective to the immigration issue.

What is now clear is that, at the first sign of pressure, he has  caved in. He has endorsed the Hawke policy on the Chinese

students issue in its entirety, thus compounding the problems  which that policy has created.

Since becoming Prime Minister four months ago, Mr Keating has  made no formal statement of his intention with regard to  Mr Hawke's 1990 decision to grant a special migrant status to  those Chinese nationals who had arrived in Australia prior to the

Tiananmen Square massacre. Under the Hawke policy, none of  those Chinese nationals would be forced to return to China if  they did not wish to do so.

It is now evident that Mr Keating has, in fact, revealed his  intention on this issue - not in an open and public way to the  Australian people, but in a way that tries to ingratiate himself  with parts of the Australian Chinese community through a letter

to one of its magazines. The text of his letter is attached.

The substance and manner of the Prime Minister's announcement is  extraordinary.  He has put sectional interests above the national interest in the hope of winning some popularity with a  particular migrant group.

He has endorsed what most observers (including many in his own  Party) concede is bad policy.

And he has tried, in the process, to denigrate the Opposition for  insisting on what applies to all other potential migrants -  namely, the need for case-by-case assessment rather than a  special exemption for a particular category.

In the light of his letter to the Australian Chinese community,  Mr Keating must undertake the necessary follow-up.

1. The Prime Minister should not limit his announcement to the  Australian Chinese community. He should make a full

statement of his views on this important issue to the

Australian people, through the Parliament when it

reconvenes this week.

2. He should make it clear that any "cuts" he may announce

over the next few weeks in Australia's immigration intake  do not take account of the special exemptions he has given  to a particular group of Chinese nationals.

On current numbers, around 20,000 Chinese nationals will be  affected by Mr Keating's decision to grant them either  permanent residence or "permanent temporary" status in  Australia. This year, the Government is expecting over

14.000 dependants to join these Chinese nationals in  Australia. This family reunion process will continue in  future years.

At present, therefore, an additional figure of around 35.000 needs to be considered in the context of any "cut"  that Mr Keating may announce in the overall migration

program. That figure will continue to grow in the years  ahead.

3. Mr Keating must explain why he is applying one test of

refugee status to all other applicants while guaranteeing  that one large group can bypass the process and stay in  Australia as long as they want.

In particular, he must explain why the Cambodian boat  people have one process for having their applications  assessed, and why around 20,000 Chinese nationals have an  entirely different process.

4. Mr Keating must make a full statement of the financial

implications of his decision and the cost to Australian  taxpayers that is involved. -

As far as Opposition policy on this issue is concerned, we have  been absolutely consistent.

On the very day (27 June 1990) that Mr Hawke and Mr Hand

announced their decision to establish a special migrant category  for Chinese nationals, I said that

"... constitutes a damaging break with clear, long-

established and well-accepted processes for determining  refugee status.

By making blanket judgements and 'special categories', the  Government's policy lacks consistency in the application of  those processes. And, without consistency, there can be  no fairness or genuine compassion in our refugee policy.

The Government had a simple duty in this matter - to

recognise that all Chinese students (irrespective of when  they arrived in Australia), and any other applicants for  permanent residency on refugee or humanitarian grounds,  have a right to have their claims heard fully and as

expeditiously as possible on a case-by-case basis".

For the record, I attach the text of a letter I will be sending  to the same Australian Chinese magazine in which Mr Keating chose  to make his announcement. My reply details the Coalition's  response to specific questions raised by the magazine.

COALITION POLICY

The Federal Opposition has put its position on the "Chinese  students" issue clearly and consistently. I understand that Mr  Philip Ruddock, Shadow Minister for Immigration and Ethnic  Affairs, has only recently answered your very detailed queries

on this matter. However, I will reiterate our position for the benefit of your readers.

1. It is correct to say that there are currently in Australian  law only three ways that PRC nationals with 437 visas can  remain after June 30 1994. At the end of the four year

temporary entry permit, the Coalition has said that each  case will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. Those who  can substantiate claims for further protection, determined  against existing internationally accepted criteria, will be

given the protection they seek.

At the end of the four years, the only way to achieve

permanent residence lawfully are:

- that a student has married, or is in a bona-fide

defacto relationship with an Australian citizen or  permanent resident; or

- on occupational grounds where the student has

qualifications that are highly skilled and recognised  in Australia, and that he or she has found a position  which cannot be filled by an Australian citizen or  permanent resident.

The question of refugee status or other humanitarian  criteria applies only if the student, at the end of the  four year permit, requires ongoing protection. That is,  that the student will satisfy the internationally

recognised criteria that he or she has a well-founded fear  of persecution if returned to the country of origin.

2. It is not correct to say that Chinese nationals applying for permanent residence under employer nomination schemes  will be assessed more favourably than applicants from other  countries. Australia has an immigration policy which does

not discriminate on the basis of race, religion or country  of origin. There is, however, an advantage for them in  that most other visitors or students, either legally  present or illegal, would not be eligible to apply for  permanent residence on occupational grounds.  This

entitlement arose because of the decision to grant Chinese  nationals a special four year temporary entry permit.   Eligibility to apply for a place in the Employer Nomination  Scheme is only available to those who have permits of one  year's duration or more.  In all other respects the

assessment is non-discriminatory and in our view that is  entirely appropriate.

3. Those Chinese nationals currently in Australia on a student visa would, of course, be allowed to remain and complete  their studies according to visa conditions and terms,  regardless of the date June 20 1994. Those who have

applied for and taken up the special four year temporary  entry permit would normally be expected to have completed  their studies. If there were claims that a student had

for some compelling and compassionate reasons not been able  to complete studies within that time frame, there could be  scope for examination by discretionary action of the  Minister. It would be our view that an additional

category of entry should not be created particularly for  Chinese nationals.

4. Again, Chinese nationals currently in Australia on a

temporary basis, wishing to change status to permanent  residency, will be assessed against normal qualifying  criteria. These do not currently include issues such as  the amount of tax paid or whether they have received social

security benefits.

5. Applications for change of status will not be determined by  the amount of money an applicant has in a bank account.

6. A PRC national can arrange to be sponsored to remain in

Australia by his or her employer. Whether or not an

application will be accepted will be assessed against  current qualifying criteria.

I certainly appreciate that this is a very sensitive matter, made  more difficult by the large number of people involved. But the  Coalition's position has always been the same.

It is crucially important that this matter is dealt with in a  totally non-discriminatory way and that the Chinese nationals are  treated in exactly the same manner as any person with claims for  protection or a wish to migrate to Australia.

We believe that the approach we have consistently advocated is  the only one that will ensure consistency, fairness and genuine  compassion.
