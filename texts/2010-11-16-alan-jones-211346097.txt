ALAN JONES:

Good morning.

TONY ABBOTT:

Good morning, Alan.

ALAN JONES:

Good to talk to you, thank you for your time. The polls suggest that the public’s support for the Gillard  Government is even at a lower ebb than it was at the election. Do you think that you are sufficiently out  there in the electorate, telling voters how they would be better off, if they got a chance in the immediate  future to vote for an Abbott government.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, Alan, during the election I said that if there was a change of government we’d end the waste, we’d pay  back the debt, we’d stop the big new taxes and we’d stop the boats and I think it’s still necessary to do these  things. So, I’m out there holding the Government to account. I think we’re presenting a credible alternative  and while, obviously, I don’t want to get hung up on polls which go up and down, I think that people have  concluded that this is a Government which, in the Prime Minister’s own words, had lost its way back in  June, but it’s still lost. In fact, I think as time goes by the change from Kevin Rudd to Julia Gillard will be  like changing the leadership of expedition Labor from Burke to Wills, they’re still lost.

ALAN JONES:

You were in Victoria at the weekend. It’s clear that the Victorian Opposition Leader, in a surprise to many,  Ted Baillieu, is closing in on John Brumby, you’re talking polls, they’re very close, and the Liberal Party  has decided against preferencing the Greens in key inner Melbourne seats. Two questions: a) why would  that be a shock, but has the Liberal Party decided at long last to bell the cat?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, there’s no doubt that a lot of the Greens’ policies are even worse than the ALP but the interesting  thing, Alan, is how so many people in the Labor Party rather want to be Greens. I mean, when Senator  Cameron said the other day that these days you’ve just about got to have a lobotomy to join the caucus, he  said that so many caucus members were lobotomized zombies. I think he was effectively saying, we really  want to be more like the Greens. So, I think that the Greens and the Labor Party are just halves of the same  alliance.

ALAN JONES:

So Liberals are not preferencing Greens, they will preference Labor ahead of the Greens, even if that returns  Brumby to government and so can this be read by the electorate as an attempt now to focus more on the  potential damage that the Greens’ policies can do to the electorate and to Australia?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, look, what the Victorians do is really a matter for them in respect of their preferences, but certainly  what we’ve got here in Canberra is a Labor-Green alliance and I fear that if the Brumby Government is  returned, regardless of the preference strategy of the Coalition in Victoria, we will end up with effectively a  Labor-Green alliance there too.

ALAN JONES:

The Labor Party has, just for the benefit of our listeners, gone into an arrangement in Victoria with the  Greens. They are saying that they will receive Greens’ preferences in 13 marginal seats in the Lower House  and in return, preference the Greens in five of the eight Upper House seats. I was amused, Tony Abbott, to  say that the Labor Party reckons they came to that arrangement reluctantly.

TONY ABBOTT:

Yeah, look, the Labor Party will do anything it can to win and, you know, these guys are hopeless at  government but they’re certainly very clever at politics.

ALAN JONES:

Talking about the Greens, they are going to introduce legislation this week, as I understand it, to reign in, the  Greens that is, bank fees and interest rate rises. Where do you stand on this stuff, because section 50 in the  Banking Act does allow regulations to be passed which limit the banks to interest rate increases determined  only by the Reserve Bank.

TONY ABBOTT:

Alan, we have an alternative position to the Government and to the Greens, our position is not more  regulation. Our position is more competition and so we’ll be introducing our own private member’s bill  designed to give the ACCC power to investigate so-called price-signalling which can often be another form  of collusion. So, we think the answer is not more government regulation. We think the answer is better  competition between the banks and certainly under the former government, when there was competition  between the banks and competition between the banks and non-bank lenders, we never had this situation.  We almost never had this situation of the banks raising their interest rates well in excess of the reserve.

ALAN JONES:

Just, nonetheless, Joe Hockey has opened a can of worms here because there is, and I’m sure you must be  aware of this, some pretty significant scholarship, including the opinion of a senior council, suggesting that  the interest rate clause in a typical Australian variable rate contract is potentially invalid. Christopher Birch   SC,  in an opinion dated in December last year, when Westpac in fact trumped the Reserve Bank increase to  the cash rate by lifting a standard variable mortgage rate 45 basis points. Birch has written, ‘I’ve concluded  it’s not possible for a bank to reserve to itself the right to vary the interest rate on a loan so as to set whatever  interest rate the bank chooses’. He says, ‘I’ve concluded,’ Birch SC, ‘that an attempt by a bank to reserve to  itself an entitlement, to vary an interest rate by whatever means it pleases would be contractually void.’  Now, each of the big four banks are doing this, in other words at any given time they can change rates, they  can change the level of credit, they can change the security for that credit. There surely needs to be a fairly  significant inquiry into some of these practices.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, that’s why, Alan, one of the things that Joe Hockey has been very prominently calling for is a new  inquiry into the banking industry in the post-global financial crisis world. We had the Wallis Inquiry about a  decade ago. That helped to set up the much healthier and more competitive banking and finance sector that  we enjoyed under the Howard-Costello Government. There’s no doubt that under the policies of this  Government we haven’t seen that sort of competition and that I think is one of the reasons why, one of the  main reasons why, we’ve got the banks acting badly. See, I think we’re overdue for an inquiry and let’s get  cracking with one.

ALAN JONES:

Well, just on that point though, I mean my information is that there are very few countries, and we are one  of those very few, and off the top of my head I think it’s at the most three, that allow the lender, that is the  bank, to adjust rates as it pleases. Now, that does seem extraordinary that someone in struggle street out  there takes out a loan for $300,000 and they signed a contract for 7.5 per cent, but at any time down the  track the lender can make it 8.5 per cent, the lender can reduce the amount that’s being lent, the lender can  reduce the security over the loan. I mean, something’s got to give on this front, surely?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, that’s a very good point and this is why people were so dismayed that the situation that pertained  under the Howard and Costello Government, where the banks almost never did this, has suddenly come to  pass under the current Government.

ALAN JONES:

Is that a consequence of weak leadership?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, the banks just thumb their noses at the Prime Minister and the Treasurer. I mean, they think that all  they get from the Prime Minister and the Treasurer is just bluster and you know, Wayne Swan has been  very, very angry 30 odd times at the banks and it doesn’t make any difference. He can stamp his feet, you  know, he can wring his hands but it doesn’t make any difference. The banks just go off and do what they  want.

ALAN JONES:

The Productivity Commission, according to the Gillard Government, is going now to examine climate  change. For my reckoning, there are about eight inquiries already on the deck, eight reports on climate

change. Why would the Government have a Productivity Commission inquiry into climate change but not  the National Broadband Network?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, that’s a very good point Alan, and you know, the National Broadband Network, I think, is a $43  billion white elephant. They’re terrified, absolutely terrified of having this subjected to serious cost-benefit  analysis because they know it wouldn’t stand up. They know that this is school halls on steroids. They know  that this is a re-run of pink-batts, only on a gargantuan scale and they are hoping against hope that they can  anaesthetise the public with this kind of cargo cult vision of marvellous services sprouting everywhere for  nothing, at least until after the next election.

ALAN JONES:

But you don’t have to be too smart to know that installing a public monopoly in this important area, critical  area of telecommunications, could as the OECD is suggesting, choke off, it’s words, choke off the  development of better internet technologies.

TONY ABBOTT:

You’re right Alan and the interesting thing is, every cafÃÂ© you go into these days has got people sitting down  at a table with their lap-tops out, all working away through wireless technology. I mean, you know, Wi-Fi is  what is enabling people to get real convenience and real mobility and increasingly fast speeds and the idea  that we should put all our eggs in the one technological basket, particularly one which doesn’t have all of the  convenience and mobility of wireless, I just think is crazy, absolutely crazy.

ALAN JONES:

Just on this, it gets a bit complicated but I’ll try and keep it simple for the benefit of my listeners. I mean, to  have all this up and running, the National Broadband Network, does require a deal between NBN and  Telstra, where Telstra hand over its copper wire and its customers to the NBN. In other words, there’s a split  between the wholesale and the retail. Now, that would create a monopoly in telecommunications, which is  contrary to the provisions of the Trade Practices Act and the Gillard Government want to exempt this deal  from competition law.

Now, Malcolm Turnbull, your man, is proposing, and I think correctly, amendments to the legislation which  will set up NBN as a monopoly because he wants them to come under the normal safeguards of competition  law. Telstra are saying, well hang on, this’ll do, and why would Telstra worry. I mean they’ve already had  the guts ripped out of them, they’re saying, well the deal would be off if this is going to go on and on and  on, checking it against competition requirements. Now, where do you stand on all of this? Are you going to  get the numbers for those amendments to go through?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, we’ll have to wait and see won’t we Alan, because..

ALAN JONES:

That’s on today is it?

TONY ABBOTT:

Yeah, yeah, this is all coming to a head today. But look, what they’re doing I think with Telstra is spending  $11 billion to buy Telstra’s copper network, a perfectly functional network and close it down.

ALAN JONES:

That’s it.

TONY ABBOTT:

I mean, they’re spending $11 billion on something that they’re going to close down, it’s just crazy, and you  know the other thing too, Alan, is that there are very credible reports now that by closing down the old  copper network, if you’re a pensioner or a family doing it tough, that just wants a standard telephone line,  you’re line rental is going to double from $30 to $60 a month because you’re going to have to be connected  to the National Broadband Network.

ALAN JONES:

Telstra are saying, without competition law exemption, that the deal will collapse. It’s a mess isn’t it?

TONY ABBOTT:

So look, this is becoming a complete dog’s breakfast, but again it’s typical of a Government that acts first  and thinks later. I mean, all of this apparently was cooked up on the back of an envelope in a plane because  Stephen Conroy could not otherwise get to Kevin Rudd and because the original $4.7 billion plan had  collapsed they then thought, let’s trump it with a $43 billion plan.

ALAN JONES:

Unbelievable. It is unbelievable. Now you’re going to introduce, or have introduced a private member’s bill  to refer the NBN deal to the Productivity Commission for analysis. Will you get the numbers to get that  through the Parliament?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I really, really hope so. Now, I know that the independents, they quite like the idea of a lot of money  being spent in their electorates but I think it’s very important that we ensure that that money is good value  for taxpayers. I mean, let’s not have a cargo cult mindset here. The spend has got to be good value for  taxpayers. It really does have to be established as the highest priority in this country at this time and the only  way to properly probe those questions is through a Productivity Commission inquiry. If the PC is good  enough to have a look at carbon pricing, why won’t the Government let the PC have a look at its NBN?

ALAN JONES:

Absolutely. Just finally, Julia Gillard said at the election, quite categorically and often, there would be no  carbon tax. Yesterday, she argued in Parliament, in government we tell people the truth. In Opposition,  looking at you, she said you engage in spin and slogans. What are we to make of all of this? If you want  certainty for business, surely all you have to do is to line up and vote on what both leaders promise at the  election?

TONY ABBOTT:

Yes and look, one of the reasons why people are so disillusioned with this Government is because they’ve  junked all their commitments, you know? There was the carbon tax that was ruled out before the election  and it’s ruled in after the election. There was all those detention centres that weren’t going to be opened  before the election but are desperately being opened to cope with this massive influx of boats and boat  people after the election. You know, there was the Murray-Darling Basin Plan that was going to be adopted

sight-unseen before the election but now they’re back-pedalling at a million miles an hour. The surplus was  absolutely set in concrete before the election, now it’s all up for grabs. The mining tax was all settled before  the election, now the whole thing is unravelling. You just can’t trust these people, Alan.

ALAN JONES:

It’s a mess. You’ve got to go, I’ve got to go. We’ll talk again soon.

TONY ABBOTT:

Thanks again.
