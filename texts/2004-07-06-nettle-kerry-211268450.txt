Vanstone misleads public on  kids in detention  6th Jul 04

Greens Senator Kerry Nettle, today challenged immigration Minister Amanda

Vanstone to visit the Residential Housing Project and then deny that it is simply a  prison by another name.

“I challenge Senator Vanstone to visit the detainees in those Residential Housing  Projects, to hear their stories and then tell us that they are not imprisoned,” Senator  Nettle said

“I offered to meet with the Minister to discuss my concerns regarding the Residential  Housing Project but she refused.

“Children of asylum seekers in Residential Housing Projects are not living in the  community they are in detention and it is deliberately misleading of Senator Vanstone  to suggest otherwise.

“Senator Vanstone told the press yesterday that there was only one child left in  detention centre in a deliberate attempt to mislead the public into believing that she  has release kids from detention. That is simply not true.”

“I have visited detainees in the Residential Housing Project in Port Augusta and I  know that they are still imprisoned just like the others in the detention centres.

The Greens are calling for the closure of all the detention centres and Residential  Housing Projects and for the claims on asylum seekers to be assessed whilst they are  living in the community.
