HEALTH CARE CARD ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN

A Commonwealth Government advertising campaign aimed at  Australians entitled to Health Care cards will commence  immediately after the Federal election, the Federal Minister  for Health Mr Jim Carlton announced today.

The three week advertising campaign, which will use radio  and notices in the ethnic media, will briefly describe the  benefits of the card and the conditions for eligibility. More  detailed information will be provided in multi-language leaflets  available from Social Security offices, health funds, hospitals  and welfare agencies.

Mr Carlton stressed that the campaign had nothing to do with  the election, and had been planned months in advance.

"The actual advertising will take place after the election is  over and the results are in. The purpose is not to score  political points for the Government, but to inform disadvantaged  Australians of their entitlements."

The Health Care card, introduced on 1 September 1981, is  available to the unemployed, low income earners and migrants  and refugees in their first six months in Australia. -  It  entitles beneficiaries to free public hospital accommodation,

schedule medical benefits where doctors agree to bulk bill,  and schedule optometrical services. As of 1 January this year,   Health Care card holders are also entitled to NHS pharmaceuticals  at half price ($2 per item).

Mr Carlton said that although some 600,000 Health Care cards  were now on issue, about 80 percent of these were held by  unemployed and special beneficiaries who received their cards  automatically from the Department of Social Security. It was

the low-income earners and migrants that the Government was  concerned about, Mr Carlton said.

The campaign is due to start in the week commencing 7 March 1983.
