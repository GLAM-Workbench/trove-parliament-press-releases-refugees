Boats haven’t stopped, Morrison is just returning  them to danger

A returned Sri Lankan asylum vessel has shown that refugees haven’t stopped seeking protection by  boat and the Abbott government should be focussing on finding safe ways for them to reach  Australia, not towing them back to persecution, the Australian Greens have said.

“Refugees need to be protected, not towed back to be imprisoned by their persecutors,” the Greens’  immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said.

“Scott Morrison has destroyed countless lives and spent billions of dollars on deterrence, but to  what end? People still need protection from oppressive regimes, refugees will still flee in any way  they can and now 37 asylum seekers are in a Sri Lankan jail.

“The Coalition’s tow-backs have been slammed by the UN as a serious and dangerous breach of the  Refugee Convention.

“Australia can save lives at sea while caring for refugees. We should be working with our neighbours  in the region, accelerating refugee processing and increasing Australia’s intake. That’s the only way  we can ensure that people are given a safe way to reach protection.”
