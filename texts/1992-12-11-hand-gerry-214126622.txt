Gerry Hand, MPParliament House, Canberra, AC T2600 Telephone: (06) 277 7860MPS 74/92SPEEDY COURT HEARING SOUGHT ON BOAT PEOPLEThe Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, Mr Gerry Hand, said today he would seek the earliest possible hearing for court actions on behalf of boat people who had lost their bid for refugee status.The Federal Court last night confirmed an order staying the removal of any of the 37 Cambodian boat people until 21 December.Sixteen of the group lost refugee appeals on Monday, and others are expected to receive their decisions shortly.Mr Hand said he would seek the earliest possible hearing of any applications before the court as he was concerned that delays would unnecessarily prolong the detention of these people.The Federal Court last night adjourned the matter until December 21, with Mr Justice O'Loughlin indicating to lawyers representing the boat people that he hoped they would file any applications before that time.If no applications were made, and if there were no other requests of substance at that time, Justice O'Loughlin indicated he may be prepared to accept arguments put forward on behalf of the Minister.Mr Hand said the claims of the boat people had now been scrupulously and exhaustively considered, and for 16 their appeals for refugee status had been rejected.Failed asylum-seekers who have no claim to remain in Australia are required, by law, to be removed from Australia as soon as practicable.The Minister said that unless the court determines otherwise, moves would be made to do this immediately the Federal Court action was resolved. He also stated that, in accordance with the law, the boat people would continue to remain in detention until that time.CANBERRA 11 December, 1992MEDIA ENQUIRIES: Lynne AdamsMinister's Office (06) 277.7860COMMONWEALTH PARLIAMENTARY LIBRARY MICAH
