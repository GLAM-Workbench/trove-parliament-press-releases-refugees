MORNINGS WITH DEBORAH CAMERON - 702 SYDNEY ABC RADIO

THURSDAY, 11 NOVEMBER 2010

Subject: Family Law

Deborah Cameron:  Robert McClelland is the Federal Attorney-General and he joins me now.   Attorney-General good morning.

Robert McClelland:  Good morning.

CAMERON:   What are the changes, the central guiding changes that you have made to the Family  Law Act?

McCLELLAND:  We’re expanding the definition of what constitutes domestic violence and  similarly what constitutes, child abuse. We are removing disincentives to report issues of family  violence. And similarly we’re imposing a broader obligation on legal practitioners to notify the  court of these matters and similarly, the courts to inquire into these matters. That’s the three areas of  principal detail.

CAMERON:  Now, what have been the disincentives to reporting family violence that you’ve  addressed?

McCLELLAND:  We’ve had three reports very substantial reports on these matters and they’ve  found that two elements in particular. There is a provision currently in the Act that was introduced  in 2006 called the ‘cooperative parent provision’ and it requires the court to have consideration as  to whether or not a parent has been cooperative in the relationships.  The expert advice in this  reports is that can be a disincentive,  for people to raise issues of domestic violence or abuse for fear  that they may be branded an ‘uncooperative parent’.   And indeed there has been suggestions in  some cases that lawyers have cautioned about venturing into that territory.

The second has been in respect to another provision that requires the court to impose a cost order on  an indemnity basis - in circumstances where alleged domestic violence is found to be false. So that  has been advised to us as being a disincentive for these matters to be raised.

CAMERON:  I was interested that you mentioned that you regard now lawyers as having special  obligations that they didn’t have before. Why was that necessary?

McCLELLAND:  Well, lawyers are currently required to advise their clients of the desirability of a  child spending time with both parents and that’s fair enough, that’s still there. But we have also  included specific obligations on lawyers if matters are brought to their attention concerning abuse  or alleged domestic violence to notify the court.  Then there is the corresponding duty on the court  to make proper inquiry including, if necessary, to inquire police or child protection authorities so  that the full story is before the court.

Attorney General News Release 2



CAMERON:   Now, in a way, does that elaborate on what David Roberts, who works for  Relationships Australia, was just talking about? That it can take a long time for someone who has  suffered domestic violence to reveal that to a counsellor, whereas they might reveal it much more  quickly to their lawyer?

McCLELLAND:  There’s a bit of that as they will have practical knowledge- the family  relationship centres still do an excellent job.  The area that we still have to grapple with and still  haven’t come up with the solution is the confidentiality of the mediation itself.

Now, public policy is that parties should be able to discuss matters there in confidence. On the other  hand, if the discussions do raise serious matters of domestic violence or abuse, how do we, in those  circumstances, consider breaching that confidentiality so that matters are brought before the court?   We’ve got a separate body looking at that issue, and that’s next line of work for us in this matter.

CAMERON:  My guest this morning is Robert McClelland, the Federal Attorney-General,  discussing changes to the Family Law Act. One of the central changes, Attorney-General, has been  the raising of the idea that, children come first, that shared parenting and equal custody may not, in  all cases, be in the best interests or safety of the child. Now, attacking share parenting, fifty-fifty  parenting, might be seen by some as a denigration of fathers. Is it?

McCLELLAND:  No, not at all.  We’re not changing the presumption of shared parental  responsibility. That is presumed that both parents have equal responsibility in raising a child on  decisions as to their education, their health, the location and so forth.

But the court has said that that shared responsibility is not the same thing as shared time and the  courts will look at the best interests of the child, and the specific child that is before them.  The  court will require parties to make a decision if necessary, that they deem to be in the best interest of  the child. In exercising that discretion, as you point out, we’ve moved up the court’s consideration  of the safety of the child, and that will now be above the desirability of that child spending time  with both parents.

CAMERON:  Attorney-General, while I have you, I would very much like to get your thought on  the decision in the High Court this morning on the asylum seeker case. What’s your response?

McCLELLAND:  I haven’t read the decision and Chris Bowen, the Minister for Immigration, will  be making an announcement later in the day.  I understand that effectively orders have been made  in favour of the claimants, and we’ll obviously have a look at that and the repercussions to consider  any additional review mechanisms.  We’ll obviously have a closer look at the decision.

CAMERON:  How serious are the legal repercussions from where you sit?

McCLELLAND:  Without knowing the details, it’s hard to say. Clearly thought has been given to  different possibilities and different potential review mechanisms.  That might now be relevant but  we’ll just have to wait and see and read the reasoning of the court to find the appropriate course of  action.

CAMERON:  Thank you very much for your time this morning.

McCLELLAND:  It’s my pleasure.
