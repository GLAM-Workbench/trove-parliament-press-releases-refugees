INTERVIEW WITH TONY JONES

LATELINE, ABC TV

14 JULY 2010

SUBJECTS: Economic Statement; MRRT revenue; asylum seekers

JONES:

Wayne Swan thanks for joining us.

TREASURER:

Good to be with you Tony.

JONES:

Now, despite the global financial crisis, your assessment of the economy  seems to be back to the optimism of your very first Budget which was  largely based on rivers of gold coming from the commodities boom in the  mining industry. Is that a fair assessment of where we're at now?

TREASURER:

Well, we're certainly got a strong economy compared to the challenges  that we have faced over the past 18 months or so, and there's no doubt  that the terms of trade are very important in this statement today.

But what's most important, and what really stands out has been the fact  that during the global recession we managed to keep employment  growing strongly. The fact is we've had something like 350,000 jobs  created in the past year, and what that says is that the Government's  stimulus was very effective. It also says, being in the fastest growing  region in the world, the Asia Pacific is also very important as we go  forward.

So I think it's a commentary on the Government's tight fiscal  management over the past 18 months, a commentary on the impact of  stimulus, which has been very important to keep businesses open, to

keep small businesses going, and also on the growth in our region which  has been quite important going forward.

JONES:

Alright. The economist, Chris Richardson it was, who coined the phrase  'rivers of gold' after your first Budget. The rivers of gold that are going to  put you into surplus for the next three years are essentially from the sale  of two commodities, that's iron ore and coal, is that not right?

TREASURER:

No, that's not the case. We are coming back to surplus because the  Government has been successful in supporting our economy. It means  our deficits have not been as high as they otherwise would have been,  because we've had stimulus in place, and the reason we're coming back  to surplus in three years is basically because of the Government's fiscal  rules.

But what has been a bonus, over and above that, has been the increase  in the terms of trade and in particular the prices we are now getting for  some of our commodities, particularly coal and iron ore. But the main  reason that we are coming back to surplus earlier is because of the  application of our 2 per cent rule, the cap on spending which means that  we are exercising a degree of fiscal discipline in our budget, and on top of  that…

JONES:

Alright…

TREASURER:

We've now got the added benefit of the terms of trade, but we're not  using the revenue from the Mining Tax to come back to surplus…

JONES:

Well, I'm not talking about the mining tax at the moment, you're using  the revenue from the mining boom more precisely. How sustainable is it  for the future of the Australian economy to be so reliant on forecasts for  two commodities?

TREASURER:

Well, it is not completely reliant on forecasts for two commodities, it's not  that at all. The fact is that we do have a higher terms of trade as we go

forward, but we don't expect those record high terms of trade to last  forever, so you'll see in the forecasts today that they do taper off.

But the great news for Australia as we go forward is that the growth in  the Asia Pacific is going to mean that over time our terms of trade will be  higher than they have been historically, not necessarily at the record  highs we have now.

JONES:

You were happy to talk in your press conference earlier today about the  sustainability issue. Talk to us about that, because the Australian  economy is now so reliant on the mining boom, and on these two  commodities in particular. The question arises…

TREASURER:

No, but it is not Tony…

JONES:

… as to whether or not this is sustainable.

TREASURER:

Well, it is not completely reliant on the mining boom or just two  commodities. It's an important part of our story, but what is part of our  story has been the resilience of the Australian economy, the underlying  resilience which goes back to a whole host of factors, reform over 25  years, I could run through all of that.

The impact of our stimulus which meant that we avoided the capital  destruction and the skill destruction that comes with high and prolonged  unemployment. We've avoided all that. That means as the global  economy recovers we are in a position to stand on stronger foundations  and maximise the opportunities that will come from stronger growth in  our region, and with that is the higher terms of trade.

JONES:

Alright. What happens if the Chinese economy hits the wall? Because your  forecasts are all reliant on these record levels of growth in the Asian  economy and, in particular, on the Chinese economy.

TREASURER:

Well, can I just make this point, that, when you talk you about the Asia  Pacific, it's not just China Tony. There is also India, it's Indonesia, it's  Malaysia it's South Korea. So, the Asian story is a far broader one.

You see, when you go the G20 you now have developing economies  sitting there with developed economies and what is apparent is that the  American consumer, or the European consumer, is not going to drive  global growth as we go forward. It is going to be driven particularly from  the growth in our region and that's a story which is bigger than China. But  when you come to China, I think it is a very important point, China has  demonstrated, particularly during the global financial crisis, just how  strong and resilient that economy is.

Yes we should be wary about something bad happening in the Chinese  economy, but I'm pretty sure, even when things aren't going quite right,  you are still going to have very substantial growth in that Chinese  economy which is going to be of benefit to the region and, of course  benefit to this country as we go forward.

JONES:

Let's turn to the Mining Tax then. You've now forecast it's going to raise  $10.5 billion in the forward estimates, that's thanks to a bonus of $6  billion due to higher than expected commodity prices, is it not?

TREASURER:

Yes it is. It is the case…

JONES:

Well, let's just explain, first of all, why Treasury didn't figure this out  earlier.

TREASURER:

Well, there's a variety of factors they take into account when they make  their forecasts but, during the negotiations with the mining companies it  became apparent to the Treasury in their discussions with the mining  companies, that they had a far more optimistic view, not just about the  price of coal and iron ore, but also about the volumes that will be traded  in the years ahead, and they factored that into their forecasts. But it  wasn't just the fact that the mining companies had that view, the  Treasury validated that.

We also had new forecasts from ABARE as well, and in addition to that we  had the latest contract price negotiations. So the forecasts that they have  put forward come from those three influences, and bear this in mind

Tony, the Treasury has a responsibility to update their forecasts, this is a  normal thing that they do. So when conditions change they do update  their forecasts, and when the new design of the Mining Tax was presented  to them they went away and did what they always do.

JONES:

You took responsibility today for what effectively appeared to be a  mistake by Treasury. Why did you feel it necessary to do that?

TREASURER:

I don't think it's a mistake Tony…

JONES:

Well, why did you take responsibility for it then?

TREASURER:

Because I'm the Treasurer. I sit there and I accept responsibility for  everything that we put out and I do it because we have professional  advisors in the Treasury who are being bagged all of the time by our  political opponents in a completely unjustified way.

This Treasury has worked for this Government in the same way that it  worked for the previous conservative government, performing the same  procedures in the same way, but I think it's a bit unfair when our political  opponents target the Treasury all the time, and most particularly their  forecasts in a most unreasonable and unfair way.

JONES:

Okay. Let's get it straight exactly what is happening. There's $10.5 billion,  that's coming straight off the bottom line of the big mining companies, off  their profits is that right?

TREASURER:

That's right yeah.

JONES:

So that is effectively super profits that you're talking about.

TREASURER:

That's right.

JONES:

The tax on super profits.

TREASURER:

That's right.

JONES:

So can you explain why after their extraordinarily public campaign to stop  you putting in place a Mining Tax that was going to net $12 billion off  their super profits, that they so readily agreed to sign up to a tax which is  going to take most of what you originally asked for, $10.5 billion?

TREASURER:

Well, Tony I don't think that they so readily agreed. I think we had a  pretty willing, difficult and tough negotation, but we eventually reached a  conclusion. We reached a conclusion by agreeing with them that there  was a better tax to be designed than the original one. So the MRRT has  substantially different features from the original tax that we designed. We  reached agreement on that design, and then when the new figures for  prices and volumes, if you like, were factored in what that meant was that  we had revenue of $10.5 billion over the forward estimates. That was  pretty…

JONES:

The obvious question is, did the mining companies know when they  signed up to this deal that they were gonna be handing over to the  Government $10.5 billion as opposed to $12 billion? So a difference of  only $1.5 billion on a tax they said was gonna put the economy at  sovereign risk?

TREASURER:

Well, I think their view was that the previous design was gonna raise  much more if it was applied than we had estimated in the original  estimates. But the most important thing was to get the design of the tax  right so that it encouraged investment, and so that it provided a fair  return to the Australian people for the resources they own 100 per cent.

So we got that design right and then we factored in the new price outlook  and the outcome was a figure of $10.5 [billion], only $1.5 billion less than  the original estimate. With that money we were determined to ensure  that we could give small business a decent tax break which we're doing,  boosting superannuation and infrastructure.

JONES:

Alright. I also want to get to the bottom of these negotiations because  you said today that they're not all that happy about this.

TREASURER:

No I don't believe they are.

JONES:

So I'm asking is there any possibility that some of these big mining  companies looking at the figures they've now signed up to, to be taken  out of their own revenue, $10.5 billion as opposed to $12 billion that you  originally proposed, that they stood against and had a public campaign  against, that they might turn around and say - well we don't really agree  to this deal after all?

TREASURER:

Well, I think that they have agreed with the Government that this is a fair  outcome and I think it's welcome. The fact is that we are in the middle of  commodity boom mark II, it is going to go for a very substantial period of  time. And the Australian people were not going to get fair value from the  resources they own 100 per cent, and which can only be dug up once,  unless we put a new arrangement in place.

I think this is a very big reform for Australia which will ensure that as we  go through the years ahead our children and their children will get a  better and fairer share of their mineral wealth…

JONES:

Of the miners that you sat down with, the three big mining companies,  which ones are no longer happy, as you say, as you said today, they're  not at all happy about this?

TREASURER:

We reached agreement with three of the miners, that is true, in terms of  the negotiation, but what we had in mind was the interests of the mining  industry and the nation overall.

You will see there will be a number of people out there that are saying  they're not happy with this arrangement. The fact is we think it's a fair  outcome for the country and a fair outcome for all of the sector, not just  the three that were sitting at the table.

In addition to that, we have put in place a committee to oversee the  implementation of this design and to iron out any wrinkles that may be  there, headed by Don Argus and Martin Ferguson, and we will work our  way through all of these issues as we go forward. But I'm confident that  we do have an agreement made in good faith which will do the right thing  by the country and also the right thing by industry.

JONES:

Let's just go over this, because if you've got an extra $6 billion which  Treasury didn't realise, or at least didn't inform you of earlier, that means  the original tax would have raised something around $18 billion, is that  right?

TREASURER:

Well, it certainly would have raised substantially more than we thought  but we never set out to raise that amount of money. We had a figure in  mind of around $12 [billion] where we could make a start on the  fundamental tax reforms to strengthen and broaden our economy.

Now when we saw the new prices, when we saw the new design, it was  welcome news that the prices were up, it was welcome news that we  would raise around $10.5 billion and that we could substantially  implement all of those initiatives that we have put forward.

JONES:

Were the miners chiefly angry because they knew the real figures all  along, they knew this was going to take $18 billion or more from their  bottom line?

TREASURER:

Tony I can't speak for the miners. What I can say is…

JONES:

Well, you can speak for yourself, and I'll just interrupt you for one  second…

TREASURER:

I certainly can.

JONES:

So when did you actually learn these figures? Was this when Kevin Rudd  was still Prime Minister or afterwards?

TREASURER:

No, we got the most updated information afterwards in the final few days  before we made the announcement and that was a result of good  discussions with the major companies and some good work from the  Commonwealth Treasury.

JONES:

So there's no chance Kevin Rudd could have got the same deal that Julia  Gillard got, is that what you're saying?

TREASURER:

I don't intend to speculate about that. This was a long and difficult  negotiation Tony, and I think it was always going to be long and difficult.  The really good news is that we've got a great outcome for the country.  We've got the resources to drive tax reform, that's a good thing.

JONES:

So could Kevin Rudd have got the same deal as Julia Gillard got? Because  the picture that was painted was of Julia Gillard being the great circuit  breaker, when in actual fact it's all about money.

TREASURER:

Well, when Julia became Prime Minister she did get on the phone, she had  very high level discussions with a number of the mining companies, they'll  have to speak for themselves, but certainly from that period on the  negotiations became more productive and we reached a successful  conclusion. But this was always going to be a long and difficult negotiation  and it was.

JONES:

Tony Abbott said on July 2 after you'd cut this deal, you and Julia Gillard,  that the next election was still going to be a referendum on tax, and on  this tax in particular. Do you expect that to remain the case through the  whole campaign?

TREASURER:

This is quite extraordinary. We've got Tony Abbott who's now opposing  the revenue from the MRRT which we are going to use to give a big tax

cut to small business, to boost superannuation and also to invest in  infrastructure, and at the same time as opposing that revenue to do all of  those good things for the Australian economy, he's going to increase the  company tax rate for many companies by almost 2 per cent.

That is extraordinary. It is stupid. It is economically illogical but that is  the position that Tony Abbott and the Liberal and National Parties have  got themselves into. A completely irresponsible position.

They were the ones that were saying the mining companies were paying  too much tax. Now the mining companies are saying they weren't paying  enough, they're willing to pay more, and Tony Abbott won't accept the  money.

JONES:

A final question Wayne Swan, have you calculated the cost to the Budget  of setting up and paying for regional offshore processing centres, possibly  more than one, for asylum seekers in East Timor and some other  unspecified country?

TREASURER:

Well, Tony, we don't pre-empt future decisions, should there be a future  decision in that area, and I certainly couldn't comment on that at all.

JONES:

So no one's had any discussions in Cabinet with what this might cost the  Budget? I mean it could be $1 billion?

TREASURER:

Tony, as you know I don't talk about Cabinet discussions on your  important program.

JONES:

But it's important that the public knows. Is this is going to blow a huge  hole in the Budget, is it not?

TREASURER:

If the Government were to take any future decision in any policy area  Tony, it is subject to our strict fiscal rules and those fiscal rules relate to  that 2 per cent cap that I was talking to you about before. So anything  that is done in any policy area in the future is subject to those rules. So

anything we did in any different area, no matter what it was, wouldn't be  blowing a hole in our Budget.

JONES:

Wayne Swan, we'll have to leave you there, we know you've got other  appointments. We thank you very much for taking the time to come and  talk with us tonight.

TREASURER:

Good to be with you.
