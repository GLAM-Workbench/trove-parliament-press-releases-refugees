SPEECH BY

THE MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND MULTICULTURAL 
AFFAIRS

MR PHILIP RUDDOCK MP

ON 8 JULY 1998 AT THE LAUNCH OF:

Â

THE DEPARTMENT OF IMMIGRATION AND MULTICULTURAL 
AFFAIRS’ CLIENT SERVICE CHARTER

Â

THE CHARTER OF PUBLIC SERVICE IN A CULTURALLY 
DIVERS  E 
SOCIETY

Â

THE INFORMATION KIT, AUSTRALIAN IMMIGRATION: THE FACTS

Â

Ladies and Gentlemen:

Â

TODAY IS THE FIRST STAGE IN A NATIONAL CAMPAIGN AIMED AT PUTTING SOME 
TRUTH BACK IN TO THE IMMIGRATION DEBATE AND SHOWING HOW MIGRATION BENEFITS 
ALL AUSTRALIANS.

Â

SER IOUSLY FLAWED INFORMATION IS BEING SPREAD ABOUT THE MIGRATION 
PROGRAM - AND IDEAS AND POLICIES ARE BEING CIRCULATED WHICH HAVE MORE 
TO DO WITH SLICK RHETORIC THAN SUBSTANCE.

Â

CLEARLY IN MANY CASES THE PEOPLE PROPAGATING THIS RHETORIC HAVE EITHER 
VERY LITTL E KNOWLEDGE OF HOW PROGRAMS WORK OR, AND PERHAPS MORE 
TO THE POINT - DON’T WANT TO KNOW.

Â

WHY LET THE FACTS STAND IN THE WAY OF A GOOD STORY.

Â

UNFORTUNATELY, SOME OF THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR PROPAGATING THESE MYTHS 
CONTINUE TO SPREAD MISINFORMATION AND WILFUL  DISTORTION OF THE 
FACTS WITHOUT ANY ACCOUNTABILITY.

Â

THESE MYTHS AND DISTORTIONS PREY ON COMMUNITY ANXIETIES 
AND CREATE UNNECESSARY FEAR OF AUSTRALIA’S MIGRATION PROGRAM AND THE 
GOOD PEOPLE WHO ARRIVE HERE TO MAKE AUSTRALIA THEIR HOME.

Â

SUCH DIVISIVE TACTICS SHOULD BE CONDEMNED AS UNAUSTRALIAN.

Â

I BELIEVE THAT PROPERLY UNDERSTOOD ON THE BASIS OF 
FACTUAL INFORMATION, OUR IMMIGRATION PROGRAM DOES HAVE THE SUPPORT OF 
MOST AUSTRALIANS.

Â

I ALSO BELIEVE THAT THE LEVEL OF MISUNDERSTANDING 
IN THE GENERAL COMMUNITY IS LARGELY ATTRIBUTABLE TO PAST MISMANAGEMENT.

Â

THE PREVIOUS GOVERNMENT FAILED TO BE OPENLY ACCOUNTABLE ABOUT THE 
NATURE AND BASIS OF OUR IMMIGRATION PROGRAM.

Â

THEY FAILED TO INFORM ALL AUSTRALIANS ABOUT THE IMMENSELY BENEFICIAL 
NATURE OF A PROPERLY FOCU SED MIGRATION PROGRAM.

Â

IN SO DOING, THEY FAILED THE PEOPLE OF AUSTRALIA.

Â

SINCE I TOOK ON THIS JOB, I HAVE BEEN DETERMINED TO REVERSE THOSE 
TWO TRENDS.

Â

I HAVE ENSURED THAT ALL AVAILABLE DATA AND INFORMATION ABOUT AUSTRALIA’S 
MIGRATION PROGRAM IS WIDELY D ISTRIBUTED AND DISCUSSED IN NUMEROUS 
FORUMS —

Â

INCLUDING BY HOLDING TWO OF THE FIRST PUBLIC MEETINGS ON IMMIGRATION 
MATTERS EVER HELD IN THIS COUNTRY.

Â

AND I HAVE BEEN RESOLUTE IN PROMOTING THE BENEFITS OF PAST, PRESENT 
AND FUTURE MIGRATION TO THIS COUNTRY  —

Â

INCLUDING THE LAUNCH OF SEVERAL INFORMATION PACKAGES ON PRODUCTIVE 
DIVERSITY.

Â

I WILL CONTINUE THIS APPROACH.

Â

I WILL BE VISITING EVERY STATE AND TERRITORY TO LAUNCH THREE IMPORTANT 
INITIATIVES WHICH UNDERLINE THE GOVERNMENT’S COMMITMENT.

Â

THESE INITIA TIVES WILL HELP ENSURE THE PROTECTION AND SAFEKEEPING 
OF AUSTRALIA’S MIGRATION HERITAGE AND THE PRESENT REALITY OF ITS CULTURAL 
DIVERSITY.

Â

THESE PRODUCTS ARE MY DEPARTMENT’S CLIENT SERVICE 
CHARTER, THE CHARTER OF PUBLIC SERVICE IN A CULTURALLY DIVERSE SOCIETY 
AND THE INFORMATION KIT,   AUSTRALIAN IMMIGRATION THE FACTS .

Â

AMONG OTHER THINGS THEY WILL HELP ENSURE THAT NO AUSTRALIAN, 
WHATEVER THEIR BACKGROUND, HAS TO FACE ANY BARRIERS TO FULL PARTICIPATION 
IN OUR SOCIETY.

Â

THIS IS NOT ONLY BECAUSE IT IS THE RIGHT THING TO 
DO — IT IS THE AUSTRALIAN WAY TO GIVE EVERYONE “A FAIR GO”.

Â

BY USING THE SKILLS AND EXPERTISE OF ALL AUSTRALIANS 
INCLUDING MIGRANTS, WE DEVELOP AS A NATION — BOTH SOCIALLY AND ECONOMICALLY 
- IN WHICH ALL AUSTRALIANS CAN REAP THE BENEFITS.

Â

LET ME NOW TALK ABOUT THESE THREE PRODUCTS IN MORE 
DETAIL:

Â

THE CLIENT SERVICE CHARTER

Â

MY DEPARTMENT’S CLIENT SERVICE CHARTER WAS DEVELOPED 
TO ENSURE CLIENTS RECEIVE HIGH QUALITY SERVICE.

Â

THE CHARTER SETS OUT STANDARDS WHICH CLEARLY EXPLAIN 
WHAT CLIENTS CAN EXPECT FROM US AND WHAT, AS A DEPARTMENT, WE NEED FROM 
CLIENTS SO THAT WE CAN DO OUR JOB.

Â

THAT IS, TO DEAL WITH INQUIRIES AND APPLICATIONS IN AN INFORMATIVE, 
HELPFUL AND EFFICIENT MANNER AND WITHOUT DISCRIMINATION.

Â

A KEY ELEMENT OF THE NEW CHARTER HAS BE EN TO GIVE CLIENTS A 
VOICE:

Â

THEY WILL BE ABLE TO MAKE SUGGESTIONS OR COMPLAINTS OR, FOR THAT MATTER, 
COMPLIMENT STAFF ON THE PROVISION OF GOOD SERVICE;

Â

WHILE CLIENTS WILL BE ENCOURAGED TO RESOLVE ISSUES WITH THE PERSON 
WHO PROVIDED THE SERVICE, IF THIS D OES NOT WORK THEY WILL BE 
ABLE TO TAKE THE MATTER UP WITH A COMPLAINTS OFFICER;

Â

THESE OFFICERS ARE BASED IN ALL STATES AND TERRITORIES AND AT MOST 
OVERSEAS POSTS.

Â

IMPORTANTLY, CLIENTS NEED TO KNOW THAT IF THEY MAKE A COMPLAINT IT 
WILL IN NO WAY IMPACT ON THE OUTCOME OF THEIR APPLICATION.

Â

CLIENTS ALSO NEED TO KNOW WHAT THE CHARTER D OES NOT DO, IN 
PARTICULAR IT DOES NOT GIVE CLIENTS ACCESS TO REVIEW OF UNFAVOURABLE 
DECISIONS.

Â

THE CHARTER IS ABOUT THE QUALITY OF SERVICE DELIVERY 
— NOT DECISION OUTCOMES.

Â

THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT DISTINCTION.

Â

GOOD CLIENT SERVICE DOESN’T ALWAYS MEAN SA YING ‘YES’.

Â

IN FACT, IN ORDER TO DELIVER A BALANCED MIGRATION PROGRAM THAT IS 
IN AUSTRALIA’S BEST INTERESTS WE OFTEN HAVE TO SAY ‘NO’.

Â

BUT WHEN WE SAY ‘NO’, WE MUST DO SO IN A CLEAR AND COURTEOUS MANNER.

Â

AS A FINAL POINT, IT IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THA T SOME SERVICES 
ARE PROVIDED THROUGH THE PRIVATE OR COMMUNITY SECTORS.

Â

EVEN SO, THE GOVERNMENT REMAINS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE QUALITY OF ALL 
OF THESE SERVICES - SUCH AS ENGLISH LANGUAGE TUITION PROVIDED UNDER 
THE AMEP.

Â

WHILE THE STANDARDS FOR THESE SERVICES  ARE SET OUT IN THE CONTRACTS, 
COMPLAINTS ARRANGEMENTS STILL APPLY.

Â

I SEE THE DEPARTMENT’S NEW CHARTER AS AN IMPORTANT STEP IN BRINGING 
DOWN THE BARRIERS TO GOVERNMENT SERVICES OR FULL PARTICIPATION IN AUSTRALIAN 
LIFE.

Â

THE CHARTER OF PUBLIC SERVICE IN A CULTURALLY DIVERSE SOCIETY

Â

THE DEPARTMENT’S CHARTER IS LINKED TO A WHOLE OF 
GOVERNMENT COMMITMENT WHICH IS SET OUT IN THE CHARTER OF PUBLIC SERVICE 
IN A CULTURALLY DIVERSE SOCIETY.

Â

THIS CHARTER APPLIES TO THE WHOLE PUBLIC SERVICE AND 
AIMS TO ENSURE THAT ALL COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT SERVICES ARE RESPONSIVE 
TO THE NEEDS OF OUR CULTURALLY DIVERSE SOCIETY.

Â

ALREADY MANY FEDERAL AND STATE GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS 
ARE PURSUING POLICIES AND PROGRAMS CONSISTENT WITH THIS CHARTER.

Â

AT THE COMMONWEALTH LEVEL THERE’S BEEN CONSIDERABLE 
PROGRESS IN ENSURING ALL GOVERNMENT SERVICES ARE PLANNED AND DELIVERED 
WITH THE NEEDS OF OUR CULTURALLY DIVERSE SOCIETY IN MIND.

Â

THIS WHOLE OF GOVERNMENT APPROACH SPECIFIES THE VALUES 
AND STANDARDS OF CLIENT SERVICE THAT PEOPLE CAN EXPECT FROM PARTICULAR 
GOVERNMENT AGENCIES.

Â

AUSTRALIAN IMMIGRATION THE FACTS

Â

THESE TWO CHARTERS ARE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, ABOUT 
DELIVERING CONSISTENTLY HIGH QUALITY, PROFESSIONAL SERVICES IN A NON-DISCRIMINATORY 
WAY.

Â

WHICH BRINGS ME TO THE THIRD AND FINAL PROD UCT - AUSTRALIAN 
IMMIGRATION THE FACTS - AND HOW IT SETS OUT SOME FACTUAL INFORMATION 
ABOUT OUR NONDISCRIMINATORY MIGRATION PROGRAM - SOMETHING AUSTRALIA 
SHOULD BE VERY PROUD OF.

Â

IT MIGHT BE A TOUGH PROGRAM WITH STRICT OBJECTIVE CRITERIA. IT IS 
A PROGRAM  WITH HEALTH AND CHARACTER REQUIREMENTS.

Â

IT IS A PROGRAM THAT EMPHASISES SKILLS AND ENCOURAGES 
PEOPLE TO SETTLE IN REGIONAL AUSTRALIA.

Â

IT IS DEFINITELY A PROGRAM THAT SEEKS TO BENEFIT ALL 
AUSTRALIANS.

Â

AND IT IS A PROGRAM UNDER WHICH MIGRANTS COME TO AUSTRALIA 
TO REALISE THEIR DREAMS AND ASPIRATIONS - TO CREATE WORK AND BUILD 
A NATION; TO GENERATE GOODWILL FOR INCREASED TOURISM; TO BENEFIT BUSINESS 
BY CREATING LINKS IN AN INCREASINGLY COMPETITIVE WORLD.

Â

THE KIT I AM LAUNCHING TODAY SETS OUT THE FACTS ABOUT 
THESE ISSUES.

Â

IN RECENT TIMES, IT HAS BECOME DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE TO DISTINGUISH 
FACT FROM F1CTION IN THE DEBATE ABOUT IMMIGRATION AND CULTURAL DIVERSITY.

Â

THIS CONCERNS ME, AND AS A RESULT I SOUGHT TO HAVE THE KIT I LAUNCHED 
LAST YEAR UPDATED SO THAT  I COULD DIRECTLY ADDRESS COMMUNITY 
CONCERNS.

Â

THE FIRST EDITION WAS A ‘SELL OUT’. OVER 15,000 
COPIES WERE DISTRIBUTED, AND EVEN NOW, THE KIT’S INTERNET SITE ALONE 
AVERAGES 800 ‘HITS’ PER WEEK.

Â

PEOPLE DO WANT TO KNOW THE FACTS.

Â

THIS NEW KIT ADDRESSES THE MYTHS THAT HAVE BEEN REPEATEDLY 
GIVEN PUBLIC VOICE IN RECENT TIMES.

Â

IT SETS OUT THE FACTS SO THAT PEOPLE CAN MAKE INFORMED 
JUDGEMENTS ABOUT THE ISSUES.

Â

AND THESE ARE FACTS NOT AS THE GOVERNMENT SEES THEM 
—BUT THE FACTS AS THEY ARE.

Â

WHEN YOU READ SOME OF  THE MATERIAL SOME OF YOU WILL THINK I 
AM BEING TOO TOUGH AND OTHERS NOT TOUGH ENOUGH...WHAT THE GOVERNMENT 
HAS A RESPONSIBILITY TO DO IS STRIKE A BALANCE.

Â

FOR EXAMPLE THERE HAS BEEN SOME DEBATE ABOUT THE NEED FOR MIGRANTS 
TO SPEAK ENGLISH.

Â

THE FACT IS T HAT 75 PER CENT OF MIGRANTS HAVE A HIGH LEVEL 
OF ENGLISH AND OF THOSE WHO DON’T MANY ARE IN FACT REFUGEES.

Â

MANY PEOPLE SEEM TO BELIEVE THAT MIGRANTS GO STRAIGHT ON TO WELFARE.

Â

WRONG. MIGRANTS CAN’T ACCESS WELFARE UNTIL THEY HAVE BEEN IN AUSTRALIA 
FOR AT LEAST TWO YEARS. ONLY REFUGEES CAN CLAIM SUCH BENEFITS.

Â

THEN THERE IS THE DEBATE ABOUT WHETHER MIGRANTS AR E GOOD FOR 
AUSTRALIA.

Â

HERE ARE JUST SOME OF THE FACTS:

Â

EACH BUSINESS SKILLS MIGRANT CREATES, ON AVERAGE, SIX NEW JOBS AND 
INVEST MILLIONS OF DOLLARS;

Â

TOURISTS, SUCH AS FAMILY AND FRIENDS COME TO VISIT MIGRANTS HELPING 
TO GENERATE SOME $16 BILLION IN EXP ORT EARNINGS;

Â

TOURISTS ALSO CREATE JOBS 
FOR SOME 700,000 AUSTRALIANS;

Â

MIGRANTS HAVE MADE, AND 
CONTINUE TO MAKE, MAJOR CONTRIBUTIONS IN THE FIELDS OF MEDICINE, SCIENCE, 
PRIMARY INDUSTRY, MINING, SPORT, EDUCATION, THE ARTS AND CULTURE AND 
BUSINESS.

Â

OUR HI GHLY TARGETED MIGRATION PROGRAM ENSURES AUSTRALIA BENEFITS 
FROM THE SKILLS, EXPERIENCE, NETWORKS AND SHEER ENTREPRENEURIAL ABILITIES 
OF MIGRANTS.

Â

THESE MIGRANTS ARE HELPING TO POSITION AUSTRALIA AS 
AN IMPORTANT PLAYER IN THE GLOBAL COMMUNITY, PARTICULARLY AS WE ENTER 
AN INCREASINGLY COMPETITIVE 21ST CENTURY.

Â

I WOULD NOW LIKE TO MOVE TO THE LESS FORMAL PART OF 
THE AFTERNOON.

Â

IN 1987 FOUND1NG MEMBER OF THE FAMOUS SINGING GROUP 
THE SEEKERS AND AUSTRALIAN OF THE YEAR IN 1967, BRUCE WOODLEY, - WROTE 
THE SONG   I AM 
AUSTRALIAN .

Â

I UNDERSTAND FROM BRUCE THAT THE SONG STARTED WITH THE BELIEF THAT 
IT IS POSSIBLE TO TALK ABOUT NATIONAL UNITYÂ  PARTICULARLY IN A 
COUNTRY WITH SUCH A DIVERSE ETHNIC BACKGROUND AS OURS.

Â

SINCE 1987 THE SONG HAS FOUND ITS WAY INTO THE HOMES  AND HEARTS 
OF MILLIONS OF AUSTRALIANS AND HAS BECOME PART OF COMMUNITY LIFE AND 
HELPED CREATE A DEEP SENSE OF BELONGING.

Â

WOULD YOU PLEASE WELCOME BRUCE WOODLEY, HIS DAUGHTER 
CLAIRE WOODLEY AND THE AUSTRALIAN YOUTH CHOIR TO SING FOR YOU   I AM AUSTRALIAN .

Â

THANK-YOU
