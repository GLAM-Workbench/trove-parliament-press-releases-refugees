CHRISTMAS ISLAND A VISA FACTORY FOR PEOPLE SMUGGLERS

Mr Scott Morrison MP

Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship

The Rudd Labor Government’s failed border protection policies and the special deal done with the passengers

who held the Oceanic Viking to ransom, are responsible for the tensions now arising in the Christmas Island

detention centre, Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Scott Morrison said today.

“Senator Evans claims that the reason for the delays in processing the Tamils on Christmas Island is the result of

delays in providing security clearances,” Mr Morrison said.

“If that is the case, what shortcuts in security checking were made to process those on the Oceanic Viking in as

little as six weeks?” he said.

“With the population of the centre at unsustainable levels already and new boats arriving every week, the

Government is now reeling from the consequences of their own weak policies.

“The Government is making a difficult situation even worse with soft policies and weak decisions.

“The most important priority of the Rudd Labor Government should be stopping the boats and reinstating the

Coalition’s strong border protection measures - measures they systematically unwound since November 2007.

“The population of the detention centre has increased ten fold since the latter half of last year and the boats are

still coming, encouraged by the policies of the Rudd Labor Government and people smugglers.

“Nearly everyone in the detention centre has paid a people smuggler. More than 9 of every 10 applicants get a

visa. Christmas Island has simply become a visa factory for people
