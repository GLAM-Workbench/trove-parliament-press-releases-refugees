MEDIA RELEASE MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS ALEXANDER DOWNER

FA097           1  September  2006





VISIT TO EAST TIMOR



I will visit East Timor 3 to 4 September to attend the third Australia-Indonesia-East Timor  Trilateral Ministerial Meeting in Dili.

The trilateral meeting comes at an important time in the development of close and  cooperative relations between Australia and two of our closest neighbours.

It also gives me the opportunity to engage East Timorese Foreign Minister JosÃÂ© Luis  Guterres and Indonesian Foreign Minister Dr Hassan Wirajuda on a range of security and  economic developments in our immediate region.

My colleagues and I will consider cooperative approaches to countering the shared threat  of terrorism and transnational crime.

Discussion will also include the outlook for East Timor, including the role Australian-led  international security forces will play on the ground to support the new UN Mission in  East Timor (UNMIT).

Australia hosted the second Trilateral Ministerial Meeting in Adelaide in August 2003.   The inaugural meeting was held in Bali in February 2002.
