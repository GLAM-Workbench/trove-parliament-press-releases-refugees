Federal responsibilities for cities: Latham addresses Evatt Foundation

In a major speech to the Evatt Foundation in Sydney today, Labor Shadow Minister for Housing and Urban Development Mark Latham has outlined Labor’s vision for Australia’s great cities.

“The growth of our cities is being driven by Federal factors: economic openness, active migration and major infrastructure decisions, including the construction of airports and universities,” Mr Latham said.  As a result, “Federal Government needs to take greater responsibility for the urban consequences of its policies.”

Mr Latham outlined Labor’s view of three key responsibilities for Federal Government: urban sprawl, urban renewal, and urban affordability.

The opportunity for Federal Government in urban sprawl is more effectively to manage growth.  “The Federal Government has a role to play in securing an integrated form of development, so that jobs and services are available as the residents move in,” Mr Latham said.  “The Mawson Lakes development in Adelaide is an outstanding example of how this can be achieved.  Through land banking and public-private partnerships, high quality yet affordable housing is being built adjacent to a technology business park, two new schools and a university campus.”

In urban renewal there is urgent work to do.  “Urban renewal should be a leading objective of the Commonwealth State Housing Agreement (CSHA).  We need to follow the model adopted by the Defence Housing Authority in the 1990s.  Through partnerships with progressive developers such as Delfin, DHA was able to fully redevelop its housing stock.  I want the CSHA to be a redevelopment agreement, not just a funding agreement for rental housing.”

Finally, Australia faces a housing affordability crisis.  “Labor’s policy review will consider a range of innovative home ownership models, such as shared equity schemes, co-operative housing, matched savings accounts and nest-egg accounts for young Australians.”  As Mr Latham told the Evatt Foundation, “This is my top priority in housing policy”.

Federal Responsibilities for Cities

Speech to the Evatt Foundation Seminar on Suburban Sydney

Mark Latham, Shadow Minister for Housing and Urban

Development

Sydney, 18 March 2002

___________________________________________________________

In The Australian newspaper last month, Christopher Lloyd, a Professor

of Economic History at the University of New England, lodged the

following letter to the editor:

What happens when Mark Latham’s suburban strategy, and Gough Whitlam’s

before him, is successful and the erstwhile Labor-voting disadvantaged

suburbanites achieve their aspirations, get their higher degrees and city or

academic jobs, move to Bondi, become Radio National listeners, develop a

conscience about asylum-seekers and Aboriginal injustice and grow to hate

monarchical symbolism? (1)

Professor Lloyd may know a lot about economic history but he needs to

update himself on the recent history of Western Sydney.

Increasingly, successful people in our region are staying in the western

suburbs.  They are more likely to move into new, double-storey housing

estates - such as Macquarie Links, Glenwood and Glenmore Park - than

move to Bondi. (2)

2

Professor Lloyd has repeated one of the dated stereotypes about Sydney’s

urban geography: that the city is divided in two - the west and the rest.

Even worse, he has repeated an elitist and patronising view of the

suburbs: that educated people do not live there, decent jobs are located

elsewhere and its residents are yet to develop a social conscience.

All of this, of course, is nonsense.  Every day, the changing face of

Western Sydney further dates and invalidates this stereotype.

Globalisation has transformed suburban Sydney - its economic

aspirations, its urban form and its political values.

The western suburbs have benefited from this process.  Commentators

who depict the region as an endless flatland of fibro homes and fringe

dwellers do so from a position of ignorance.  They are blind to the

economic revolution of the 1980s and 90s and the new politics this has

created.

It is no longer a question of the west and the rest.  Sydney is now a large,

global city with a range of regions and interests.  We need to modernise

our understanding of the metropolis.  I would argue that the city has

broken into three distinctive arcs.

First, a Global Arc that stretches from the North Ryde business park

through the North Shore, the inner-city and the eastern suburbs to

Kingsford-Smith Airport.  This is an internationally competitive and

cosmopolitan area with all the lifestyle attractions (and expenses) of a

world city.  Politically, the Global Arc is willing to embrace the rights

agenda and symbolic issues.  At the 1999 Republic referendum, for

instance, each of its Federal electorates voted Yes (Bennelong, Bradfield,

3

Berowra, Warringah, North Sydney, Sydney, Lowe, Grayndler,

Wentworth, Kingsford-Smith and Barton). (3)

Second, a Middle Arc that spans the older western and south-western

suburbs - from Hurstville to Blacktown, from Auburn to Liverpool.  This

area comprises a mix of traditional working class communities and newly

arrived migrants.  It has above-average levels of unemployment and

welfare dependency.  It also features a high rate of urban churning,

especially in its ethnic base.

Bob Birrell’s research at Monash University has identified a sharp rise in

the proportion of overseas-born people in the Middle Arc, matched by a

corresponding increase in Australian-born populations in Sydney’s inner

and outer suburbs. (4) This is what the Americans call “white flight” - the

movement of young families and retired people from troubled

neighbourhoods to the relative stability of the urban fringe.

Third, an Outer Arc that stretches from the new release areas of the

Central Coast to the North-West Corridor, Penrith/Hawkesbury, the

Macarthur region, Sutherland Shire and North Wollongong.  These

suburbs reflect the benefits of economic mobility.  They house the small

businesspeople, the contractors, franchisees and consultants of the new

economy, living in double-storey estates on the urban fringe.

When Paul Keating said in the 1980s that his economic reforms would

change Australia forever, he meant it.  Thirty years ago, there were

200,000 small businesses in this country.  Today there are one million.

That’s an additional 800,000 small business families.  And where do they

4

live?  Most likely, in the new suburbs ringing Australia’s major cities,

close to their businesses and the communities in which they grew up.

This is the great driver of economic aspiration in our society.  When I

grew up in Green Valley in the 1970s, our values were based on the

politics of us versus them - the working class versus the North Shore.

Now, when a young person grows up in my electorate, they can see

prosperity in the neighbourhood next door.  Social mobility has become

more tangible and achievable.  The politics of envy has been replaced by

the politics of aspiration.

The other dominant political theme in the Outer Arc is social

responsibility.  For the first time in Sydney’s history, moving to the outer

suburbs has become a lifestyle decision.  People do not want the troubles

of other areas to follow them to the fringe.  This is why they place a

premium on public decency and responsibility.  Not surprisingly, people

who have experienced lawlessness truly value the rule of law.  This is the

commonsense of suburban life.

Contrary to Professor Lloyd’s assertion, the suburbs have a strong social

conscience.  It is based on a practical understanding of how the good

society requires a certain level of order and cohesiveness.  This is one of

the pillars of social justice: the shared expectation that people are

responsible for their own behaviour.  Indeed, none of our institutions can

succeed without sanctions against irresponsibility.

It is not possible to learn and succeed at school if some students are

allowed to cause chaos in the classroom.  It is not possible to have a

strong and trusting community if people live in fear of crime.  It is not

5

possible to create public confidence in the tax-transfer system if people

can get away with fraud and free loading.  Social rights need to be

matched by social responsibility.

Thus, politics on the fringe follows two golden rules:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The party that backs economic aspiration ahead of economic envy

will most likely win; and

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The party that has the longest list of excuses for people who do the

wrong thing will most likely lose.

Federal Responsibilities

If these changes were only happening in Sydney, it might be possible to

leave them to the States and local government.  In practice, however, they

are occurring throughout our capital cities.  Sydney may be Australia’s

first global city but it will not be the last.  Globalisation is also having a

profound impact on Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth.

The growth of our cities is being driven by Federal factors: economic

openness, active migration and major infrastructure decisions, especially

the construction of airports and universities.  In the new economy,

airports are the equivalent of the seaports of the 19th century - the main

transit points for the movement of people and products.  Universities

generate much of the knowledge and innovation of the Information Age.

Both are essential to the development of global economies and global

cities.

The Federal Government needs to take greater responsibility for the urban

consequences of its policies.  It is not sufficient for the national

6

government to drive change in our cities but leave the management of

change to the States and local government.  Cities, the places where most

Australians live, are a national responsibility.

No level of government can afford to ignore the impact of

internationalisation on our communities and lifestyles.  As a discipline,

urban planning has lost much of its certainty.  In the new economy, the

location of investment and jobs is moving at a faster rate than urban form.

This has increased the degree of difficulty in planning our cities and

suburbs.  All levels of government need to respond to this challenge.

There are other good reasons for Federal responsibilities.  Urban form

and efficiency have a powerful impact on Australia’s economic growth

rate.  For instance, 30 per cent of Australia’s GDP is produced within a

100km radius of the city of Sydney.  In large part, our national prosperity

relies on the effectiveness of transport, communications and settlement

programs in our major cities.  Economic management and urban planning

are two sides of the same coin.

Simon Crean has declared his intention to put cities back on the national

agenda.  We want to modernise Australia’s housing and urban policies.

This is a vital part of the Labor tradition.  For 50 years, this issue has

differentiated us from the Tories.  Menzies left the enormous post-war

growth of our cities to the States.  Gough Whitlam and Tom Uren put

suburban services and infrastructure on the national agenda.  Fraser took

them off.

This cycle of action and inaction continued in the 1990s.  Brian Howe

created the Better Cities Program and then, in one of the early and worst

7

decisions of his government, Howard abolished it.  As with most issues,

he has returned to the narrow complacency of the Menzies years.  Even

though Federal policies are changing the face of our cities, the Federal

Government has little interest in urban policy.  It sees the cities solely as

a cost-cutting exercise, through reduced funding for the Commonwealth

State Housing Agreement and urban infrastructure.

The only Federal Minister to take an interest in urban form has been Joe

Hockey. (5) The Hockey plan for Sydney is to double its population - to

bring an additional four million migrants to the city, without additional

Federal support for their settlement and the services of a civilised city.

All change, no responsibility.  This is the Howard and Hockey approach

to urban policy.

Urban Sprawl

As a world city, Sydney will continue to grow.  This is inevitable.  The

challenge for government is not to prevent growth but to more effectively

manage it.  The city should not be allowed to sprawl beyond its

environmental, financial and lifestyle limits.  I oppose the Hockey option

of a mega-city of eight million people, stretching from the Southern

Highlands to Newcastle, devoid of open space and urban amenity.

Sydney must not become the next Los Angeles.

We must recognise the natural limits of our geography.  Sydney is

surrounded by fragile river systems and national parks.  Its topography

and wind movements are conducive to photochemical smog, especially in

the Cumberland Basin.  On environmental grounds alone, we must

combat Sydney’s sprawl.

8

The financial and lifestyle costs of urban sprawl are also excessive.  It is

estimated that the public cost of servicing a new housing lot on Sydney’s

fringe is 25 times more expensive than the cost of infrastructure for in-fill

development.  High-quality consolidation is a town planning and

economic necessity.

Without the effective management of Sydney’s growth, the costs of

congestion will continue to grow.  This is a car-dominated city in which

more than 80 percent of journeys are made by private vehicle.  In the

Outer Arc, car transport is a way of life.  There are huge social and

lifestyle costs if people are forced to travel long distances for

employment and basic services.

In my 25 years of political involvement in the outer suburbs, there has

only ever been one issue.  How do we move the jobs and services to

where the people have moved?  Without adequate planning and

provision, commuters are forced to spend long periods of time - up to 20

hours a week - away from their families and communities.  Urban sprawl

is a barrier to social capital.

Sydney’s Outer Arc has many more labour force participants than labour

market jobs.  Penrith, for instance, has a job deficit of 36,000.  In

Campbelltown the shortfall is 34,000.  This results in long journeys to

work on Sydney’s congested roads.  In peak hour, it now takes 70

minutes to travel from Campbelltown to Blacktown and 80 minutes from

Rouse Hill to the eastern suburbs.  This is a modern form of water torture

- weaving through back streets and sitting at traffic lights on under-developed roads.

9

These are serious problems for which all levels of government must take

responsibility.  National economic and migration policies are driving

Sydney’s growth.  The national government must be part of the solution

on the urban fringe.  It needs to meet the legitimate aspirations of

suburban families to live, work and learn in the one community.

In effect, we must demand a higher standard of urban development.  In

the past, governments have released residential land without requiring the

early development of employment land.  While in recent decades,

developers have paid contributions for the provision of municipal

services, they have not contributed to the new urban agenda, particularly

the provision of community-based education and lifelong learning.

This must change.  The Federal Government has a role to play in securing

an integrated form of development, so that jobs and services are available

as the residents move in.  The Mawson Lakes development in Adelaide is

an outstanding example of how this can be achieved.  Through land

banking and public/private partnerships, high quality yet affordable

housing is being built adjacent to a technology business park, two new

schools and a university campus.

This model needs to be replicated nationally.  Aspirants on the urban

fringe are demanding a range of new services, such as broadband Internet

access, telecommuting and learning centres.  It is good commercial

practice to make these facilities available.  It is good government policy

to partner these efforts.  Integrated development is the best way of

achieving win-win outcomes - for residents, developers and

governments.

10

This is a key objective in the ALP’s policy review process.  We want

people in the outer suburbs to be able to live, work and learn in the one

community.  We want to overcome the Howard Government’s neglect of

housing and urban affairs.  We reject the Hockey option of unlimited

sprawl and congestion.  A Federal Labor Government will fulfil its

responsibilities for Australia’s cities.

Urban Renewal

In the past, the urban renewal agenda has been associated with the inner-city.  As Sydney has grown older, however, the need for renewal has

moved to the Middle Arc.  The mass of three-storey walk-up flats

constructed in the western suburbs in the 1960s and 70s has deteriorated

significantly.  These areas usually adjoin public housing estates that also

require redevelopment.

This is an opportunity for Federal/State/private housing partnerships.  The

objective should be to consolidate and redevelop the sites, with a better

mix of housing types and urban design.  Given the proximity of these

neighbourhoods to town centres and public transport, it is possible to

achieve strong commercial and urban consolidation outcomes.  Most

importantly, the renewal projects would substantially upgrade the

amenity and lifestyle of places like Liverpool, Fairfield and Bankstown.

Urban renewal should be a leading objective of the Commonwealth State

Housing Agreement.  In the private sector, more than 50 percent of new

capital spending goes into home renovations.  In public housing,

however, renovation work has been as scarce as employment creation.

11

More than half of Australia’s public housing stock was constructed before

the 1960s, often in the wrong place with the wrong design.  It badly

requires redevelopment.

This will not be achieved without private sector involvement.  State

housing departments simply do not have the expertise or resources to do

the job properly.  We need to follow the model adopted by the Defence

Housing Authority in the 1990s.  Through partnerships with progressive

developers such as Delfin, DHA was able to fully redevelop its housing

stock.  I want the CSHA to be a redevelopment agreement, not just a

funding agreement for rental housing.

Federal/State cooperation is also required to overcome public housing

poverty.  This is the slow-burning scandal of Australian public life - the

steady deterioration in the social and economic environment of our

broadacre housing estates.   We need to develop new and innovative

solutions to poverty, through social entrepreneurship, social venture

capital and community ownership schemes.  These ideas will be

examined in Labor’s policy review, along with other reforms to end the

curse of social exclusion.

Urban Affordability

Australia faces a housing affordability crisis, both in the ownership and

rental markets.  Home ownership rates among young Australians have

fallen.  Low-income families have been priced out of the property market

in our major cities.  Cutbacks to public housing have produced record

waiting lists and placed additional pressure on private sector rents.

12

In the past, governments have dealt with affordability concerns through

demand-side policies, such as rent assistance.  These strategies need to be

complemented by supply-side policies that ease the pressure on the rental

market.  Increased home ownership has a crucial role to play in this

process.  By reducing the demand for rental accommodation, it is possible

to drive down rental prices.

Labor’s policy review will consider a range of innovative home

ownership models, such as shared equity schemes, cooperative housing,

matched savings accounts and nest-egg accounts for young Australians.

Whereas the current homeowners grant was designed to compensate for

the negative impact of the GST, Labor wants to create permanent and

more substantial forms of assistance for homebuyers.  This is my top

priority in housing policy.

Other affordability strategies will also be examined, including:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Government land banking on the urban fringe as a way of

combating price speculation and urban sprawl;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Urban renewal partnerships that consolidate public and private

sector sites and reduce unit costs;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The revitalisation of the CSHA and expansion of public housing

stock; and

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Streamlining the planning approvals system, with lower

compliance costs and more flexible development codes (such as

dual residential use by small business).

13

Conclusion

Before he became President, Abraham Lincoln wrote that, “the legitimate

object of government is to do for the people what needs to be done but

which they cannot, by individual effort, do at all or do well for

themselves.”  This idea, pioneered on the Illinois frontier, is just as

relevant today on the fringe of Australia’s cities.

In isolation, the private property market can not achieve for people the

social benefits of integrated development: the containment of urban

sprawl, the provision of basic services, the renewal of housing stock and

more affordable accommodation.  These things can only be achieved by

government - not just part of the public sector, but by all levels of

government working together.

This role is doubly significant for the national government.  The States

and local Councils do not have the power or resources to deal adequately

with the urban consequences of globalisation.  Federal responsibilities are

all-important.

This is why Labor wants to put cities back on the national agenda.  We

are the only party with a clear vision for suburban Australia:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Economic ownership for all;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Social responsibility from all;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Fully serviced and cohesive communities with all.
