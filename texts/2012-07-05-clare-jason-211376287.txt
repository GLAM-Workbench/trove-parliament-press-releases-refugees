Joint Press Conference

with Tony Negus and Simon Corbell

Canberra



JASON CLARE:   Today is a very important day for the Australian Federal Police.  It’s a day where we  set ourselves up for the future, and it’s a day where we honour the work and the achievements of  the past.

Today, we have announced the establishment of a Specialist Response Group  within the Australian Federal Police. It will be the biggest specialist police group in Australia and will  do work here responding to incidents in Australia - across the country - as well as overseas.

Today, I've also announced that we'll be expanding the Police Overseas Service  Medal to the honour - to honour the work of Australian Federal Police officers who have served  overseas training other police forces and building the skills and the capability of police in countries  like Afghanistan, in East Timor, and the Solomon Islands. It will take effect immediately and be  retrospective. It means that about seven-hundred-and-fifty Australian Federal Police officers will be  eligible for this medal.

Today, I've also announced that we'll be extending the Australian Police Overseas  Service Medal to the Kiaps. Two thousand individuals will be eligible for this - people that served in  PNG from 1949 to 1973, who did very important work.

And the work of Senator Kate Lundy, the work of Senator Jan McLucas, the work of Scott Morrison -  the member for Cook and the shadow Minister for Immigration - all working together with myself  has made this possible. But most importantly, the campaign by the Kiaps themselves for this honour

has made this possible. It's long overdue and I'm glad that we are making this announcement today  after the approval that we've received from the Queen.

So, it's a very important day - one that sets us up for the future and honours the achievements of the  past. I'll now ask Minister Corbell to say a few words and then I'll ask Commissioner Negus to say a  few words.

SIMON CORBELL: Thank you very much, Jason. And the ACT Government is delighted to recognise  today the amalgamation of ACT policing's Specialist Response and security group with the AFP  National's Operational Response Group to form the SRG.

This is a very important capability for the national capital. It means increased  capability in areas such as bomb response, search and rescue, water police operations, police divers,  tactical resolution, which is needed here in the national capital.

The ACT Government has an ongoing and important relationship with the Australian Federal Police.  We have an important contract to deliver policing services for the national capital and for the  Canberra community. And this enhancement of tactical and operational response capability will  deliver the level of safety and security our police need in dealing with more complex, difficult and  challenging situations that are part of the day-to-day task of ACT policing.

It also means more search capability for our local ACT police when it comes to  dealing with large scale events. It means more specialist police when they are needed on the front  line in the ACT community delivering the capability, delivering the specialist knowledge and skills  needed to keep our community safe.

I'd like to commend and congratulate the AFP on bringing together these two  groups and the enhanced capability it provides. Thank you.

TONY NEGUS:     Thank you, Minister. Look, as you've heard, this is an aggregation of a number of  different tactical operational areas of the AFP into one. It provides almost two hundred officers who  will be now really working together at the forefront of tactical resolution of a range of different  activities across the country.

Not only will these people be working in the ACT as Minister Corbell has said, but  they will be deployed to places like the Solomon Islands, to Christmas Island, if required, and to  other parts of the country to help us in the resolution of organised crime and terrorism  investigations more broadly as the AFP.

So a very proud day - it's taken two years to bring this together. This group you'll  see will be, as we'll see in the demonstrations very shortly, are the equal of anything you'll see  anywhere in the world. Their capability is second to none and we look forward to them working as a  homogenous group now to continue that for the people in the community and really the residents of  the region - throughout this part of the world.

So thank you very much for coming and we'll look forward to seeing the  demonstrations shortly. I think we're open to questions.

QUESTION:           Minister Clare, do you have any concerns that the Border Protection and Navy are  being used as a breakdown service for asylum seeker boats?

JASON CLARE:   I'm happy to answer that question. Let's make sure that we address all of the  questions about the police announcements first and then we can take all the questions on asylum  seekers if you like. Any questions specifically on the announcement we've just made.

QUESTION:           [inaudible] explain a bit more about what it means for the ACT - more jobs, and,  specifically, how many more police in a scenario?

SIMON CORBELL: The amalgamation maintains the existing level of operational capability previously  in Specialist Response and Security Group. So that's about fifty-six, fifty-eight full-time specialist  response police. That capability is maintained. But because it is now amalgamated with the ORG to  form the Specialist Response Group, we now see the capacity for police stationed here as part of  AFP national operations to be available to surge and provide that additional response capability as  needed to ACT policing.

So that number will vary depending on needs, but what it means is they're here  and they're available and, also, they are more familiar with the needs of the ACT community  because they are rotated through the ACT policing function - so a very important extra capability for  our community when we have those special incidents or those large-scale events that need that  additional response.

QUESTION:           Would these be - would this be the group that would be used if we had another  Australia Day incident with the Prime Minister?

SIMON CORBELL: So certainly, the deployment of the SRG will be done, obviously, at the operational  level by the chief police officer and his commanders. But we know that we do need that capability  around public order - maintaining public order, maintaining community safety at large events.

So whether it's an event involving national dignitaries and national activities or whether it's simply a  large-scale public event in the national capital, these police are the type of capability needed to  support frontline community policing officers. And we are maintaining that and enhancing that  through the amalgamation.

QUESTION:           Commissioner Negus, how regularly would you see these police officers working  around the country in other states and territories?

TONY NEGUS:     Look, the operational activities of the AFP are on a weekly basis, so these people  will deploy to Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and other parts of the country to assist in high-risk  tactical resolution of organised crime matters and terrorism matters.

But again, it will not reduce the capability of the ACT to respond in matters on a  daily basis here either. So - but they train together. Their equipment is purchased in a more efficient  way. And it brings a greater capacity as a whole to the people of the ACT and the rest of the country.

QUESTION:           Commissioner, are there any concerns by SRS or ORG members about this  amalgamation?

TONY NEGUS:     Look, this has taken a couple of years to organise and to have everyone come  together. There have been people who have been required to relocate from Brisbane and  Melbourne, as I've mentioned, and that's, again, an impost on families and individuals. But, again, I  commend them for being part of what is now a very exciting new venture for the AFP.

QUESTION:           Can we get back to the earlier question?

JASON CLARE:   We certainly can and I think you've got first dibs.

QUESTION:           Minister, do you have any concerns that Border Protection and Navy vessels are  being used as a breakdown service for asylum seeker boats?

JASON CLARE:   Well, here are the facts. We know that people smugglers tell the people on the boat  to ring Australian search and rescue. Sometimes it's a false alarm. Sometimes it's the real thing. We  treat every one of those calls seriously because our top priority is saving lives at sea.

Yesterday, the people that were on their boat were very lucky. They were very  lucky because HMAS Wollongong was on route from Singapore back to Christmas Island. Now that  meant that it was in the vicinity of the search and rescue area. It meant that it was able to be on the  scene in terrible weather conditions within an hour.

It was work that was done by Australian authorities working together with  Indonesian authorities that helped to potentially save the lives of people who otherwise would have  been caught up in that terrible weather on a boat that may not have been able to cope with the  weather conditions.

QUESTION:           If this is a tactic that's increasingly deployed by people smugglers to tell asylum  seeker boat captains to just call Australian authorities, what sort of impact is that going to have on  Australia's strategic defence assets and border protection assets?

JASON CLARE:   Well, let's be clear about this. This is not a new tactic. This is something that people  smugglers have been doing for a long time. The work that our search and rescue authorities and our  border protection authorities have been doing is superb in difficult conditions. We've got something  like seventeen aircraft, about eighteen vessels, over two hundred military and border protection  command people working on his project, over a hundred police officers that are tackling people  smuggling and intercepting vessels.

As I said yesterday, we are throwing everything at this and the way to stop this is  to remove the incentive for people to risk their life and to get on a boat in the first place. That's the  way to stop this. You can intercept vessels and you can disrupt boats before they set to sea. But  that's a bit like putting your thumb on the end of a hose. What we need to do is turn the tap off -  remove the incentive for people to get on a boat in the first place. That's why we support offshore  processing because that's ultimately what is going to save lives.

QUESTION:           But do you accept that these calls are being made closer and closer to the  Indonesian shoreline? Yesterday's call was, sort of, fifty-two nautical miles out?

JASON CLARE:   Some of these calls happen very close to the Indonesian shoreline. Some of them  happen very close to Christmas Island.  We received calls from a vessel in distress last year in  December that was very close to the Indonesian shoreline.

You might remember that vessel in December just off the coast of Indonesia where two hundred  people drowned.  Now that's another example of where we received a call saying that there is a  vessel sinking, a vessel in distress where working with Indonesia, we work as hard as we possibly can  to save lives.  But let's be clear about this, this happens close to Indonesia, it happens close to  Christmas Island.  Sometimes it's a false alarm, sometimes it's the real thing.  Australian authorities  always take these things very seriously.

QUESTION:           Before the boat that capsized last month that claimed ninety lives, it was initially  just a flyover.  Should a boat have been deployed straightaway - everyone has the same call, the  same priority?

JASON CLARE:   Well the first point to make about this, and I said it at the time, is that there'll be a  full investigation to make sure that everything that should have been done was done.

You'll remember that we received a call on the Tuesday night at about 10:30.  It said that a boat was  in distress but didn't give the details of its location.  We got more information about three and a half  hours later that said that the vessel was about thirty-odd nautical miles south of Indonesia.  At that  time the Australian Maritime Safety Authority told the boat to head north, head back to the nearest  point of land.

A number of other things occurred on the Wednesday.  A Border Protection Command Dash-8 flew  over the area and couldn't identify any obvious signs of distress from that vessel.  It flew over again  the following day and that's when it found the vessel was capsized.

But let me emphasise this point, it's important that everything that should have been done was done  and that's why it'll be the subject of two investigations - an internal whole of government  investigation that will involve Border Protection, Navy as well as the Australian Maritime Safety  Authority.  But in addition to that an independent investigation led by the WA Coroner.

QUESTION:           But without pre-empting the report, if a boat's seen and the flyover's conducted  and it's spotted should a boat be deployed straightaway given that it can take some time?

JASON CLARE:   I'm not going to pre-empt the enquiry, I'm not going to pre-empt the report.  I'm not  going to second guess here the decisions that operational experts make.  I'm going to make sure that  it's fully investigated and heed very closely the recommendations of both the Government review  and the independent coronial investigation.

QUESTION:           [Inaudible] Indonesia to speak with your counterparts there.  Are you going to tell  them that they need to do more within their own search and rescue zone, and do you believe  Indonesian authorities are adequately equipped to do these sorts of search and research patrols?

JASON CLARE:   We work very closely with Indonesia.  Our Australian Federal Police work very  closely with Indonesian National Police.  Our Border Protection officials work very closely with  Indonesian Customs and Border Protection officials.  Our navies work very closely together.

What I said yesterday, and what the Prime Minister said on Tuesday, is that we can do more work to  get our search and rescue authority to work more closely with Basarnas, the Indonesia search and  rescue authority.

That will involve a number of different things.  It could involve the exchange of experts, liaison  officers.  It could involve making sure that the computer systems that both search and rescue  organisations use exchange information quickly.

But it could also involve this, and that is making sure that Indonesian search and rescue has access to  the information that we have about where the merchant vessels are off the Indonesian coast so that  when they are putting out a broadcast to say, all merchant vessels in the area head to this direction,  they know which merchant vessel is where so they can get there quickly and they can direct their  information to the right merchant vessel.

Meetings will take place over the next few weeks between AMSA and Basarnas on how they can  work more closely together.  I have to stress they've work very closely together over the last twenty-four hours.  There are a number of teleconferences that took place between the two organisations  to make that search and rescue happen yesterday, but they'll have further meetings about that over  the next few weeks.

Minister Smith and I will travel to Indonesia in late August, early September along with the Federal  Police, Navy and Border Protection Command and the Indonesian equivalent organisations to see  how we can further improve the work that we do together, make it more seamless and more  effective.

QUESTION:           Can we ask you about the AFP's role in Jakarta in terms of tackling asylum seekers  and whether you see a prospect of expanding the AFP footprint in Indonesia?

TONY NEGUS:     The AFP work very closely with the Indonesian National Police and we have done  for many years in counter-terrorism, in transnational crime more broadly, but we do have people  there specifically in Jakarta working with the Indonesian National Police.

However it's important to realise that the Australian Federal Police in Indonesia don't have any  police powers.  They are there really as guests of the Indonesians and they work with them in  supporting them, in providing advice and exchanging intelligence, that's it.  But they do work closely  together.  We have very good working relationships and again, as the Minister said, we're keen to  look at anything we can do into the future to expand that.  Really the matter of whether AFP put  more people into Indonesia is a matter for Government.

QUESTION:           How far along is your investigation into the Speaker, Peter Slipper?

TONY NEGUS:     As I said a couple of weeks ago, that's almost complete, it remains almost complete  and we expect to have that finished very shortly.

QUESTION:           Have you interviewed him?

TONY NEGUS:     He hasn't been available for interview at this time no.

QUESTION:           Commissioner, do you share the concerns of some Australian authorities that  Border Protection and the AFP Office is being used as a breakdown service?

TONY NEGUS:     No, look we're talking about people's lives here.  We respond to issues as we need  to.  We investigate matters to try and put people smugglers behind bars.  We've talked at some  length I think about the efforts that are being undertaken by all Australian Government and  Indonesian authorities to make sure that we are doing everything humanly possible here to protect  people from what are perilous voyages across the sea and to stop people drowning unnecessarily.   There's a range of different factors which the Minister's already described which I think are  important in doing that.

QUESTION:           Do you receive intelligence that asylum seeker boat captains are being told to call  Australian officials early?

TONY NEGUS:     We've seen that, well not just intelligence, we've seen actual cases of asylum  seekers and captains ringing the Australian authorities early, whether they're at Christmas Island or  earlier over the last couple of years.  This is not a new phenomenon but it just seems like the last  few weeks, we've had some very difficult sea states.  We've had some very difficult situations that  these boats have found themselves in and we've had the results that we've all seen.

QUESTION:           Are you able to update us on the investigation of any people smugglers that are on  Christmas Island especially in relation to...

TONY NEGUS:     I'm aware certainly of the reporting of the - the Indonesian Police have released  that have certainly had a person in custody.  We're aware we have a person of interest who's on  Christmas Island and we're working through that matter and it's really not appropriate for me to talk  any further about that at this stage.  But certainly we're doing everything we possibly can to bring  the people responsible for these boat tragedies to justice.

QUESTION:           Can you give us an update on Captain Emad?

TONY NEGUS:     Sorry?

QUESTION:           Can you give us an update on your investigation into Captain Emad?

TONY NEGUS:     Look, that Captain Emad matter is an ongoing matter.  He remains out of the  country and we are continuing to look at what evidence can be collected here and throughout other  parts of the world.

QUESTION:           Has that man on Christmas Island been charged?

TONY NEGUS:     No he has not.

QUESTION:           One migration agent this morning said that people smugglers are effectively using  the lack of policy as a way to cash in at the moment.  Are they as across politics in Australia and do  you think they are making the most of the deadlock that we have got?

TONY NEGUS:     I think the extensive coverage of the issue, both here and internationally, means  that I think just about everyone in this part of the region is aware of the issues around these matters

so I'm not going to be drawn on what they do and don't know from our intelligence holdings.  Thank  you.
