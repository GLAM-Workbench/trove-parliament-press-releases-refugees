LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION  THE HON. TONY ABBOTT MHR  FEDERAL MEMBER FOR WARRINGAH

27 August 2011



TRANSCRIPT OF THE HON. TONY ABBOTT MHR  ADDRESS TO THE TASMANIAN LIBERAL PARTY STATE COUNCIL,  HOBART

E&OE……………………….…………………………………………………………………

I want to say that Andrew Nikolic well deserved the standing ovation youÃ¢ÂÂve just given him. I also want to  say that I feel a little bit unworthy being introduced by a man of Brigadier Andrew NikolicÃ¢ÂÂs distinction, a  little unworthy to be introduced by a man who has put his life on the line for our country repeatedly in the  QueenÃ¢ÂÂs uniform. But while I feel a little unworthy to be introduced by such a man I feel totally exhilarated  that a man of this calibre believes that he can best serve our country in our party and in our parliament.  Thank you very much Andrew for continuing to serve our country in this way and I look forward very much  to having you not just as a friend but as a colleague in Canberra.

Ladies and gentlemen, itÃ¢ÂÂs great to be here in the great state of Tasmania. ItÃ¢ÂÂs good to be with my federal  parliamentary colleagues David Bushby, Richard Colbeck, Stephen Parry, and of course the splendid Leader  of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Eric Abetz. ItÃ¢ÂÂs great to be in the presence of my distinguished  federal president, Alan Stockdale, the greatest treasurer that Victoria ever had. ItÃ¢ÂÂs good to be with Richard  Chugg and itÃ¢ÂÂs also good to be with Sam McQuestin your new state director. You know, people say that  everyone in Tasmania is related to everyone else, but Sam goes beyond that, heÃ¢ÂÂs related to most people in  Australia; certainly heÃ¢ÂÂs the brother-in-law of my conference president and I think that makes me an  honorary Tasmanian. Ladies and gentlemen, itÃ¢ÂÂs also great to be with Will Hodgman. They say that  opposition is character forming. I think that makes Will the strongest character in Australian politics because  I think he is now the longest serving opposition leader in Australian politics. He and Ted Baillieu vied for  that title for quite a long time, but just as Ted has now become a head of government I am absolutely  confident that Will Hodgman is the next premier of Tasmania.

Now, ladies and gentlemen, Will Hodgman and I have very heavy responsibilities because Will Hodgman  and I, both in our own way - he in Hobart, me in Canberra - have to get rid of bad Labor-Green  governments. We have to get rid of bad Labor-Green governments and what we are now seeing in Canberra  is an action replay if you like of what we have seen for some years now in Tasmania. Tasmania in fact has  been a social laboratory for what happens when we have Labor-Green governments in charge. ItÃ¢ÂÂs no  accident that the gross state product of Tasmania is some 20 per cent lower than the gross state products on  the mainland because what we get with Labor-Green governments is governments which donÃ¢ÂÂt know how to  say yes to peopleÃ¢ÂÂs enterprise. They would always rather find a reason to say Ã¢ÂÂnoÃ¢ÂÂ when it comes to starting  a business, opening an industry and creating a job. This is why it is so important that we have a change of  government in Hobart and a change of government in Canberra because itÃ¢ÂÂs about time that our country was  open for business. ItÃ¢ÂÂs about time that we had in power people who understand in the marrow of their bones  that you cannot have a community without an economy to sustain it. You cannot have a cohesive society if  there isnÃ¢ÂÂt the work that makes it all possible and this is why itÃ¢ÂÂs so important that we have a change of  government in Canberra.

You know, itÃ¢ÂÂs often been said that the Gillard Government is the worst since Gough Whitlam. Well, I think  thatÃ¢ÂÂs very unfair to Gough Whitlam who didnÃ¢ÂÂt lack idealism and who never sold the soul of the Labor  Party to Senator Bob Brown and the Greens. And you know, thereÃ¢ÂÂs something else to be said for Gough  Whitlam in the context of the present Labor leader, Gough Whitlam would never have run away from  parliamentary scrutiny the way this Prime Minister has over the last fortnight. Gough Whitlam would never  have trashed the institution of the parliament the way the Prime Minister has over the last fortnight, refusing  to answer reasonable questions which even Kathy Jackson, a decent and courageous woman speaking up on  behalf of the 70,000 members of the Health Services Union, says must be answered.

This is someone who has stood up for whatÃ¢ÂÂs right and for her trouble she is now the subject of the most  vicious form of payback inside the Labor Party. We had a filthy shovel left on her front door yesterday, a  sign of just what she can expect from her union and Labor Party colleagues and we didnÃ¢ÂÂt see a shred of  sympathy, not a shred of solidarity between the Prime Minister and Kathy Jackson of the Health Services  Union this week. What we saw was a Prime Minister in denial, a Prime Minister who is refusing to answer  the reasonable questions that the Australian public have for her.

ThatÃ¢ÂÂs the problem with this Government, no one is really in charge. When it comes to environment policy  Bob Brown is in charge, when it comes to economic policy the unions are in charge, and when it comes to  parliamentary ethics policy Craig Thomson is in charge. Well, ladies and gentlemen, itÃ¢ÂÂs just not good  enough and that is why we need a change of government as soon as we can humanly bring it about.  Ladies and gentlemen, if we look, if we look at Tasmania we see a pulp mill that the Government is always  finding a new reason to stop, we see a chip mill which seems is inevitably now going to be closed down, and  we see a forestry industry which is constantly having further restrictions placed upon it. They donÃ¢ÂÂt  understand, these Labor-Green governments, that youÃ¢ÂÂve got to have production; that itÃ¢ÂÂs all very well being  able to look at things but youÃ¢ÂÂve got to be able to make use of them as well if we are going to have a society  which is fit for people to live in. I love the idea of a clean green Tasmania. I love the idea of Tasmania as the  place that every other Australian wants to come to as a tourist destination. But there is no future for this  great island in tourism alone. Tasmania canÃ¢ÂÂt just be a tourism economy; itÃ¢ÂÂs got to be a manufacturing  economy, a mining economy, an agricultural economy, a seafood economy. ItÃ¢ÂÂs got to be all these things and  that means that it needs to have once more the Liberal Party in charge of the stateÃ¢ÂÂs destiny.

But, as I said, the Labor-Green disease has gone from Hobart to Canberra and we now see the same  negativity towards economic growth. We now see the same reluctance to embrace new employment  opportunities in Canberra that we have seen for far too long in Tasmania. Julia Gillard is in partnership with  Lara Giddings to pay people to get out of productive employment. Julia Gillard and Lara Giddings are in  partnership to take borrowed money that our country canÃ¢ÂÂt afford, not to build up employment but to take  away employment. The timber workers of Tasmania they donÃ¢ÂÂt want welfare, they want work. The timber  contractors of Tasmania they donÃ¢ÂÂt want to be phased out of their industry, they want to continue in their  industry and thatÃ¢ÂÂs what a decent government would enable them to do.

Ladies and gentlemen, but it doesnÃ¢ÂÂt stop there. Thanks to the timidity of the Gillard Government we are on  the verge of losing the live cattle export trade, an industry no less vital to northern Australia than forestry is  to Tasmania and it has come to a virtual halt because the Gillard-Brown, the Labor-Green Government  panicked in the face of a television programme. The same attitude to live cattle and to forestry. But it  doesnÃ¢ÂÂt stop there. The National Broadband Network - something that Labor likes to make great play of  here in Tasmania, but as part of the National Broadband Network $11 billion of borrowed money, $11  billion that the taxpayers of Australia canÃ¢ÂÂt afford, is being spent to buy TelstraÃ¢ÂÂs copper lines and close  them down. I mean, this is the worst investment in AustraliaÃ¢ÂÂs history, to buy an $11 billion functioning  asset and to close it down. But thatÃ¢ÂÂs the sort of thing that we can expect from a Gillard-Brown Labor-Green  Government.

Then of course, ladies and gentlemen, thereÃ¢ÂÂs a carbon tax. Now the whole point of the carbon tax is to make  doing things in this country more expensive, whether itÃ¢ÂÂs driving your car or turning on your heater or

3



running your business the whole point of a carbon tax is to make that more expensive. The whole point of a  carbon tax is to make it more expensive to burn coal and to burn oil and, as we know, burning oil and coal  and gas is how we produce our power and our transport and power and transport are at the heart of modern  life. So this is a tax on our way of life, itÃ¢ÂÂs a tax on the way we work, and if there is one victim of this tax  itÃ¢ÂÂs the manufacturing industries of this country. You cannot run a steel mill on solar power. You cannot run  a car plant on wind. All of this which is vital to our place as a first world economy will be under even more  competitive pressure under this carbon tax.

YouÃ¢ÂÂd think if thereÃ¢ÂÂs one thing that a decent Labor leader would want to do it is to protect and preserve the  jobs of the manufacturing workers of this country, but no, no. So eager was Julia Gillard to preserve her own  job, so eager was she to protect her position in The Lodge that she did a secret deal with Bob Brown to  preserve her job at the heart of which was a carbon tax to cruel the jobs of the manufacturing workers of  Australia. Well, Julia Gillard it was a bad trade and you should never have done it. You should never have  sacrificed their jobs or put their jobs at risk to secure your own job.

Ladies and gentlemen, this is a bad tax based on a lie. Never forget what the Prime Minister said six days  before the last election: “there will be no carbon tax under the government I lead”. This is the phrase that  should echo around every political gathering. This is the phrase that should reverberate through every  political interview from now until the next election: “there will be no carbon tax under the government I  lead”, because this is the lie at the heart of this GovernmentÃ¢ÂÂs existence. This Government fundamentally  lacks legitimacy, not simply because it lacks a majority but because it lacks integrity and there is no greater  example of a total failure of political integrity than to go to the election saying one thing and to do the exact  opposite afterwards. It makes an absolute mockery of our democratic accountability. It makes an absolute  mockery of everything that we value in a democracy such as this. Ladies and gentlemen, I say to you, I say  to the Australian people and I would like you to say with all the power at your command to the Australian  people: there should be no new tax collection without an election.

This is a message that is particularly acute here in Tasmania because itÃ¢ÂÂs not just Andrew Wilkie and Rob  Oakeshott and Tony Windsor who hold the balance of power in the hung parliament. Every single member  of parliament is a balance of power member in a hung parliament like this. And yes it would be great if the  good people of Tasmania could persuade Andrew Wilkie that this is not in the interests of Tasmania. But  donÃ¢ÂÂt stop there. Dick Adams, Sid Sidebottom, the other Labor members from this state, they too are balance  of power members of parliament and if they decide that it is not in the interests of their constituents, to stop  this carbon tax, there will be no carbon tax. So ladies and gentlemen please appeal to them as Tasmanians,  stop making excuses for a bad Government in Canberra and start standing up for the interests of the people  of Tasmania.

Not only is this a bad tax based on a lie but itÃ¢ÂÂs not fair and it wonÃ¢ÂÂt work. The Prime Minister talks about  compensation. ItÃ¢ÂÂs interesting that she talks about compensation because compensation is what you get when  someone has done you harm. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs when you get compensation, when someone has done you harm. Even  on the GovernmentÃ¢ÂÂs own figures more than three million Australian households are going to be worse off  under the carbon tax. These arenÃ¢ÂÂt rich people. A single income family with a child starts to be worse off  under the GovernmentÃ¢ÂÂs own figures at average weekly earnings. A school teacher married to a shop  assistant is worse off on the GovernmentÃ¢ÂÂs own figures. A policeman married to a part-time nurse is worse  off under the GovernmentÃ¢ÂÂs own figures.

So itÃ¢ÂÂs not fair but it doesnÃ¢ÂÂt work either because when you actually look at the GovernmentÃ¢ÂÂs own figures it  doesnÃ¢ÂÂt do what it is supposed to do. If you look at the GovernmentÃ¢ÂÂs own modelling document, page 18,  this tax which is supposed to save the environment by reducing carbon dioxide, this tax that will be $29 a  tonne in 2020, takes our carbon dioxide emissions from 578 million tonnes now - wait for it - to 621 million  tonnes in 2020, an increase not a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions! The only way, in fact, that we get  our five per cent reduction by 2020 is by spending some $3.5 billion on foreign carbon traders. Now, I have  a lot of respect for the foreign carbon traders of the sorts of countries that Kevin Rudd likes to visit. I suspect  that when he is no longer in parliament Craig Thomson might like a career as a carbon trader. ItÃ¢ÂÂs a very

4



worthy profession. But I donÃ¢ÂÂt think the Australian people are going to be very impressed with an  environmental policy that depends upon spending $3.5 billion with foreign carbon traders in 2020 and,  would you believe it, $57 billion in todayÃ¢ÂÂs money with foreign carbon traders by 2050.

Ladies and gentlemen, I really do urge all of you, I really do urge all of you to pick up the GovernmentÃ¢ÂÂs  own documents and turn to page 18, the back page of the GovernmentÃ¢ÂÂs own modelling document, because  itÃ¢ÂÂs there in black and white the figures that give the lie to the whole rationale for the carbon tax. In 2050,  when we are supposed to have reduced our emissions by 80 per cent, in fact our emissions will be 545  million tonnes, not an 80 per cent reduction but a six per cent reduction. We only achieve the 80 per cent  reduction by buying 400 million tonnes of abatement from the foreign carbon traders. It is an absolutely  crazy policy. It is an absolutely crazy policy and only a government which has sold its soul to the Greens  could possibly embrace it.

Now, ladies and gentlemen, I want to assure you that there is a better way. There is a better way to protect  the environment and there is a better way to reduce emissions and we will protect our environment and we  will reduce our emissions by providing sensible encouragement to business to do the sorts of things that it is  already doing. Sensible farmers are planting more trees on the right parts of their properties. Sensible  businesses are saving power and saving fuel. To give you just one example Linfox, the trucking company,  has reduced its emissions by some 35 per cent since 2007 simply by getting its drivers to take their foot off  the accelerator. To give you another example, Visy, the recycling business, it is actually moving to negative  emissions power generation by taking garbage that would otherwise give off methane and other harmful  greenhouse gases in landfill, taking non-recyclable garbage and burning it to produce power. So this isnÃ¢ÂÂt  zero emissions power generation it is negative emissions power generation. ItÃ¢ÂÂs happening right now. ItÃ¢ÂÂs  happening without a carbon tax and it will be much harder to do sensible things like this to reduce our  emissions under a carbon tax. So what weÃ¢ÂÂre going to do is take money from savings in the budget and  encourage, encourage Australian businesses to do more of what they are already doing. ItÃ¢ÂÂs a system of  incentives not a system of penalties. ItÃ¢ÂÂs a system which will create jobs not destroy them and itÃ¢ÂÂs a system  which is not going to add to the cost of living pressures that are already so crushing for so many of the  forgotten families of Australia.

Ladies and gentlemen, the next Coalition government will practice more responsible government, it will  produce more responsive institutions and it will foster more productive people. WeÃ¢ÂÂve seen what the current  Government has done. They took the $20 billion surplus that they inherited and they have turned it into the  worst fiscal deterioration in Australian history. Only once has Wayne Swan, the Treasurer, been able to  announce a surplus and that was way back in May of 2008 when in his first budget he said Ã¢ÂÂwell, Peter  Costello gave you a $20 billion surplus, IÃ¢ÂÂm going to do better than that, IÃ¢ÂÂm going to give you a $22 billion  surplusÃ¢ÂÂ and we all know what happened, donÃ¢ÂÂt we ladies and gentlemen. We all know what happened. He  promised us a $22 billion surplus; he ultimately delivered a $27 billion deficit. And just to prove that that  was no fluke next year he gave us a $55 billion deficit. Once he was in the groove, last year, he gave us a  $49 billion deficit. This year, as a sort of an encore, it will be a $23 billion deficit. But - wait for it ladies  and gentlemen - finally, finally Labor is going to deliver a surplus, so he says, $3.5 billion in 2012-13.

Well, look, you look like sensible people. You donÃ¢ÂÂt look like a particularly gullible crowd and I donÃ¢ÂÂt think  you believe him and I donÃ¢ÂÂt think the Australian people believe him because, ladies and gentlemen, when a  pollster last went to the Australian people - and pollsters do this when governments arenÃ¢ÂÂt going very well -  and polled ten alternative leaders of the Labor Party, it was an interesting collection of people that they put  up as potential leaders of the Labor Party. Senator Brown was there I guess because heÃ¢ÂÂs already the real  leader of the Labor Party, there was actually a member of the Liberal Party on the list. But the one person  who wasnÃ¢ÂÂt there was the Deputy Prime Minister and Treasurer and if there is one thing which so  dramatically illustrates the complete political let alone economic failure of this Government itÃ¢ÂÂs the fact that  Wayne Swan didnÃ¢ÂÂt even rate in this way.

But, ladies and gentlemen, we as Liberals believe in the Australian people. We know that if you give the  Australian people their chance they will build better communities, stronger families and a better society.

ThatÃ¢ÂÂs why we want to work with the state governments to see genuinely community controlled public  hospitals. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs why we want to work with the state governments to see independent public schools of the  sort that are now beginning the flourish in Western Australia under Colin BarnettÃ¢ÂÂs Government. We know  that if you trust the people more and the bureaucracy less you will get better services for the people who  need them most. We want to see the Australian people given more opportunity to show what they can do not  what they canÃ¢ÂÂt do and thatÃ¢ÂÂs why there will be serious welfare reform under the next Coalition government.  There will be incentives to get young people from unemployment to the places where there is work. There  will be incentives for employers who take young people off welfare and give them work and keep them  there. There will be incentives for employers who take older people, our seniors, off welfare and into work  because people should be economic as well as simply social and cultural contributors to our country.

We want the Australian people to be their best selves and I sense as I go around this country now such  disappointment, such disappointment because we know that as a nation we can be better than this. We can  be better than this. There is this pervasive sense in our country right now that we are a great country with a  lousy government and so that gives all of us in this room an important mission. I have to say as I stand  before you I am very conscious of the fact that my colleagues and I are the standard bearers for the hopes  and the dreams of ten million or more Australians. We are determined to restore good government to our  country. We are determined to restore good values to our country. We are determined to restore political  integrity to our country. We want to give this great country the better government that a great people  deserve.

Thanks very much indeed.
