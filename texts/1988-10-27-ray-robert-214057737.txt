j  ADELAIDE REUNION MARKS HISTORIC MILESTONE

j  '

;j ! A major international immigration organisation has achieved an

i  historic milestone: the Intergovernmental Committee for Migration :  (ICM) has helped its four millionth migrant.

:  The Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic

j Affairs, Senator Robert Ray, said ICM had helped 700 000

j immigrants come to Australia since its establishment in 1951.

ÃÂ  ]  Senator Ray said the four millionth ICM migrant was Mrs Mai Thanh

Thuy from Vietnam who, with her two small children, was reunited  with her husband, Nguyen Hoang Thanh, in Adelaide today after six  ;  years of separation.

'  The Minister said ICM had 33 Member States including Australia.

:  The organisation helped intending migrants with transport and the processing of documentation.

i  Mai Thanh Thuy and her children were amongst 16 Vietnamese who,

;  with travel arranged by ICM, flew into Adelaide this morning from

:  Ho Chi Minh City.

1  The 16 have come here under the Australian Government's

j Vietnamese Migration Program. The Program enables normal entry of 1  Vietnamese under family reunion and other migration program

:  categories.

Ã¢ÂÂ¢  I  Senator Ray said Nguyen Hoang Thanh had escaped from Vietnam by

)  boat in November 1982. He had been selected for resettlement in

]  Australia under the Indo-Chinese Refugee Program, and arrived in

:  South Australia in July 1983. He had been waiting to be reunited

:  with his family ever since.

’  In his message of welcome, conveyed to the family by Mr Rod

:  Sawford, MP, Member for Port Adelaide, Senator Ray said Australia

shared their joy at being reunited.

"Your reunion is symbolic of ICM's fine record of helping four  million people world-wide. It is also symbolic of the value

Australia places on family reunion," he said.

Senator Ray said Australia greatly valued its long and close  association with ICM.

"While many migrants can travel to Australia independently, ICM  is able to assist those who need help," he said.

"I have no doubt it will assist many more thousands of Australia-  bound refugees and migrants in the years ahead."

Mr Sawford presented Mai Thanh Thuy with a bouquet of Australian  wildflowers and her children with toy koalas.

The Chief of Mission for ICM in Australia, Mr Harold Grant,

passed on a framed copy of a welcoming message from the Director-  General of ICM, Mr James N. Purcell, in Geneva.

FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THE INTERGOVERNMENTAL COMMITTEE FOR  MIGRATION

The Intergovernmental Committee for Migration (ICM) is an  international organisation at present comprising 33 member States  and 18 observer States. Founded on 5 December 1951, ICM is a nonÂ­ political and humanitarian organisation with a predominantly

operational mandate.

The organisation has the following main functions:

- the handling of orderly and planned migration to meet specific  needs of emigration and immigration countries;

- the processing and movement of refugees, displaced persons and  other individuals in need of international migration services  to countries offering them resettlement opportunities;

- the transfer of qualified human resources to promote the socioÂ­ economic advancement of developing countries:

- the provision of a forum to States, international governmental  and non-governmental organisations to exchange views and  experiences on international migration issues.

In recognition of the fundamental principle of the free movement  of people and of the need for close co-operation among States to  ensure an orderly flow of migratory movements throughout the  world, ICM provides its migration services at the request of

interested governments and in co-ordination with international  governmental and non-governmental agencies.

ICM's programs are carried out by an international and locally  recruited staff of about 770 persons of whom about 150 are

assigned to Headquarters in Geneva and some 620 (including  temporary staff and staff appointed to specific programs) in 38  field offices on five continents.

The present Director-General is Mr James N. Purcell (U.S.A.) and  the Deputy Director-General is Mr Giacinto Maselli (Italy).

ICM's migration services for refugees include documentation,  processing and medical services to respond to entry requirements  in resettlement countries. For other migrants it provides  counselling, recruitment,  selection and processing services in

the country of origin; reception, placement and integration  assistance in the receiving country; and language courses for  migrant workers. /2

In all its migration activities, ICM arranges for reliable  transportation at substantially reduced costs and seeks, in close  cp-operation with governments and other agencies, to finance the  movement of migrants and refugees who, without such support,   would not be able to migrate.  Many of these movements are

financed through an ICM Loan Fund.

Current Member States are Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium,  Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cyprus, Denmark, Dominican  Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Federal Republic of Germany,  Greece, Guatemala, Honduras, Israel, Italy, Kenya,
