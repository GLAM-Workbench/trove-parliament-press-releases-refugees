MORE ILLEGALS ARRIVE

Â

The two boatloads of illegal arrivals which arrived today are further 
proof that thousands more are heading for Australia, the  Minister 
for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock said today.

Â

“We now have another boat of 62 people, including 
many children, which has arrived on Christmas Island,” Mr Ruddock 
said.

Â

“First accounts indicate that they are of Chinese 
origin. They are being disembarked in pouring rain, and will stay on 
Christmas Island until we can arrange transport to the mainland. It 
puts further strain on the limited resources at the Island.

Â

“In addition there is another vessel at Ashmore 
Reef with 35 people on board. They appear to comprise 1 Iranian, 17 
Afghans, 15 Iraqis including four females and a baby, with two Indonesian 
crew. Arrangements will be made for their transfer as soon as possible.”

Â

Mr Ruddock said that only this morning 31 people from 
the Middle East and two crew located on Ashmore Reef on Tuesday arrived 
in Darwin on route for detention at Port Hedland Immigration Reception 
and Processing Centre.

Â

“Since 1 July, 1671 illegals have arrived on 35 
boats, including the largest-ever of 352 on 1 November.

Â

“If this trend continues, we face receiving over 
4000 unauthorised arrivals by the end of the financial year, placing 
enormous strain on our detention and processing resources and the taxpayers.

Â

“My warning earlier this week that thousands of 
illegals may be on the way was real and not imagined,” Mr Ruddock 
said.

Â

“It was based on intelligence we received from international 
and domestic sources; which have proved to be accurate.

Â

“We are facing the biggest assault to our borders 
by unauthorised arrivals ever,” Mr Ruddock said. It is time for the 
Opposition to stop procrastinating and support us in our efforts to 
bring in measures to curb this trade in human life.” Mr Ruddock concluded.
