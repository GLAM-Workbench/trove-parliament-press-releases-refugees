New Boat Seized on Christmas Island to be blown 
up

Â

“The Justice and Customs Minister, Senator Vanstone, must make clear 
the fate o f the boat seized carrying 142 illegal arrivals and 
held at Christmas Island before any action is taken,” Shadow Minister 
for Justice and Customs, Duncan Kerr, said today.

Â

“Sources on Christmas Island are expecting orders 
from Canberra authorising the destruction of the vessel.

Â

“While it is an option under the Customs Act, destruction 
is usually resorted to when the vessel is worthless.

Â

“In this case, it is reported that the vessel is 
quite new and may be worth retaining and perhaps gifting to a volunteer 
organisation to be brought up to standard and used in the service of 
the community.

Â

“It seems the Government can do with all the help 
it can get. Perhaps a volunteer coastwatch operation may be able to 
convert the vessel and put it to good use.”
