The possible 150,000 illegal immigrants in Australia must again  be bemused and confused by the Government's announcement today.

It is impossible to read in clear and unambiguous terms what has  occurred.

The complexity of the Government's new Act and Regulations no  doubt leaves little room for a sensible short and succinct  statement of policy. .

However, the clear messages the Minister should have outlined  today are:

1) Australia has a serious problem of 150,000 illegal immigrants;

2) The Government intends to markedly strengthen compliance  resources to cope with the task of locating and removing the  bulk of illegal entrants quickly;

3) It intends to enhance the Migration Act's harbouring  provisions relating to illegals to ensure employers who  "knowingly" employ illegals are punished;

4) To ensure the law is fairly and properly administered a number  of minor changes affecting only a handful of illegal entrants  will be made.

In such a way the Minister would have sent a clear and  unambiguous message to all illegal entrants and intending illegal  entrants.

Philip Ruddock MP Federal Member for Dundas  Shadow Minister for Immigration  and Ethnic Affairs

A CLEAR MESSAGE

The Minister's Statement today, in more convoluted terms adopts  the minority report of Senator Olsen and myself as members of the  Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations.

It accommodates only those characterised as "innocent illegals"  as a result of circumstances beyond their control.

Those whose circumstances are so compassionate that rejection  would constitute extreme hardship and were here before 19th  December 1989 can also apply.

It also confirms that those who would have been accepted under  existing requirements as spouses, dependent children, aged  parents and the like being legally here will also be able to  apply if illegal and here before 19th December.

The Opposition has no objection to these changes.

It welcomes the fact the Minister has rejected the absorption  test of five years proposed by the Standing Committee in its  minority report.

ATTACHED ARE MY NOTES FOR MY ESTIMATES SPEECH ON THE  DEPARTMENT OF IMMIGRATION APPROPRIATIONS YESTERDAY. IT RAISES A NUMBER OF IMPORTANT QUESTIONS RELATING TO  THE BREAKDOWN IN THE ADMINISTRATION IN THE DEPARTMENT  OF IMMIGRATION, LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND ETHNIC AFFAIRS.

I AM MORE THAN HAPPY TO RESPOND IN GREATER DETAIL TO ANY  PARTICULAR ISSUES WHICH ARE OF INTEREST TO YOU.

W H Y .IMMIGRATION IS IN DISARRAY

The immigration program is important in the national interest and

failure in its administration can serve to undermine public

confidence in it.

Public confidence in the program has now been seriously

compromised by such Government administrative failure.

It is not especially related to this Minister as he has been

merely the 6th occupant in the office in 7 years.

There are two principle reasons for this failure.

1. A short sighted approach to budgetary issues ignoring

the long term consequences; and

2. A preoccupation with manner and form rather than principle

in migration selection.

AS TO ADMINISTRATION

The program has increased rapidly over time from a low point of

70,000 (1983/84) to a high point of 145,000 (1988/89).

This outcome has increased workload enormously as the number of

applicants has also grown.

Citizenship has been promoted by the Government with a

consequential workload increase.

Temporary resident visa's doubled in 2 years prior to 1988/89.

Visitor visas issued increased by 40%, from just under one

million to 1.4 million in the same space of time.

Despite what is obviously a very significant increase in

workload, departmental staffing arrangements have shown little if

any variation, except between functions.

Indicative of this is that in 1985/86 total staff employed on the

immigration function of the Department rose from 2,307.3 to 2377

in 1989/90.

The first significant increase in staff resources was in this

year's Budget where there was a rise to 2,553.

The Department and the Government parade these statistics as

successful administration, but the outcome has been a seriously

flawed migration program.

The following are mere examples of which there are many.

Refugee claims now exceed 5,000. Existing processing

arrangements will take 10 years to finalise without any

further claimants;

Growth in illegal immigration has occurred. Low estimates

by the Government of 50,000 are now acknowledged to be

more than 90,000. However, my estimate of 150,000. has not

been seriously challenged by the Minister or his

departmental advisors;

Sham marriages arranged merely to obtain migrant entry are

endemic;

* The important national interest, Business Migration

Program is so flawed in administration as to puts its very

future at risk;

* An inability to check on reports required by ELICOS

colleges as to which students fail to attend classes

because of an absence of resources.

In relation to each of these issues, what can we say of the

Government's response?

In relation to refugees spurious claims will subsume the

entitlement of the genuine for protection if the Government does

not move quickly to contain the unreasonably lax interpretations

of our courts of who should or should not be a refugee. The

question should seriously be asked when examining the sound

performance of the DORS Committee process over years, whether

there is a judicial role in this policy area.

The way in which the Government dealt with Chinese Students in

general, has lead to a breakdown in the procedures meant to

assist those who have genuine and substantial claims for

protection.

Growth in illegal immigration occurred because of a lack of

commitment to compliance activity. It is well known that a mere

2 compliance officers for each regional office of the Department,

were on average engaged in this endeavour.

As a knee-jerk reaction to the explosion in illegal immigrants

through breaches by ELICOS students saw the number of compliance

officers of 48 increased to 100, and by Minister Hand now to 150.

However, determination to deal with this problem is lacking.

Senate Estimate examination shows that there are to be only 42

extra staff for compliance work appointed this year.

Any other additional compliance staff are to be found by

re-shuffling present staff responsibilities.

This however can only lead to other shortcomings. For instance,

will compliance officers come from the intelligence and

investigation branch of the Department, which well placed advise

to me indicates are months behind in key malpractice enquiries?

In fact the most interesting statistic in the Estimates for this

year is the proposal to increase the complement of "in-house"

lawyers for drafting new laws by more than 12.

Will they come from those branches of the Department charged with

responsibility in rewriting the new Act and Regulations which

were intended to provide fair but streamlined procedures?

Could it be those with staff development responsibilities?

This could hardly be the case given the need for training and

tuition as the law itself constantly changes week by week.

Now, what is the evidence for the serious allegations by me by

growth in fraud?

Statistics released this week, indicate while all other

categories of entry fell, those entering Australia on spouse,

defacto and fiancee grounds increased by 6%. If those in the

pipeline for grant of resident status within Australia had been

processed in a timely fashion, those entering and permitted to

stay in Australia on spouse grounds would have exceeded 30,000 or

25% or the program.

Evidence of fraud was detailed by departmental officers who gave

the following example. In one overseas post where 200

applications where rejected, only 3 where sufficiently confident

in the bona fide nature of their relationship to appeal.

Estimates of some departmental officers suggest that up to 50% of

spouse applicants could be arranged with immigration being the

only principle objective.

In one office in the Department, where proper bona-fide testing

was undertaken, the rejection rate rose from 5% to 30%

How has all this occurred?

It was because the Government so streamlined the process that no

realistic enquiries were to be undertaken -into the bona fides of

a marriage other than to establish whether or not there exists a

marriage certificate.

In the Business Migration area belatedly the Department is now

targeting the two principle source countries of applicants,

namely Hong Kong and Taiwan.

There has been little realistic scrutiny of the activities of

authorised Business Migration Agents. The involvement of

overseas middlemen in pressing cases without bona fides or of a

marginal character have been left largely unchecked. While many

of the claims of fraud in this area are exaggerated or without

corroborated evidence, it is a case of where there is smoke there

is fire.

Finally in the area of compliance while for overseas students

special fees have been imposed to provide for cost recovery

compliance activity, little evidence exists that this effort has

been successful. In evidence to the Senate Estimates Committee

it was confirmed that absence of resources was the reason for the

Department's inability to act against overseas students who fail

to attend classes if required.

PREOCCUPATION WITH MANNER AND FORM

The Fitzgerald Report was the Government's landmark review of  immigration policy. The Report which sought to focus policy on

Australia's future and to give a clear economic focus to the

migration program, has been subsumed by the recommendations to

legislate for a new model Migration Act.

The Fitzgerald designer model was jettisoned for that preferred

by the Department.  That Act and its subsequent regulations has

been roundly condemned by its users - the ethnic communities,  the

judiciary - the adjudicators and departmental staff - the

administrators.

Support of Members of Parliament has been alienated. Justice

Wilcox described the new law as a complex document abounding with

cross references, and I quote "The task of ascertaining the

position in relation to a particular applicant or a particular

type of visa or entry permit is akin to feeling one's way through

a labyrinth".

Programs for training staff, recruitment of departmental lawyers,

appearances before the Parliamentary Committee and intellectual

masturbation about matters of detail rather than substance have

become the norm. It is a preoccupation of manner and form over

substance and principle. The abandonment of discretion and

judgement has come at a high price.

All of this is compounded with the Minister's and Department's

new defensive position and secrecy. There is already an  unreasonable reliance on privacy laws designed to obscure the

public interest even where the law designates that there are

public interest factors involved in determining migration

applications.

The obvious example is the case of the Imam of the Lakemba Mosque

where the Minister has made a closed door decision without

explanation of the sought given to the Parliament by his

predecessor.

This is but a brief catalogue of the Government's lamentable

failure in administration of the immigration program, which has

undoubtedly led to the most significant undermining of confidence

in it that I have seen in my 17 years in Parliament.
