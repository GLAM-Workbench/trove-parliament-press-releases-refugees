STATEMENT TO PARLIAMENT

Significant changes have occurred in the world in recent  months. The U.S. and China have established full diplomatic  relations . 'This is a welcome move that will assist, the U.S.  to  pursue a more fully developed policy in Asia.

U.S. policy has in the past been inhibited by a lack of ,   formal recognition. Now that this hurdle has been overcome  the possibilities for more constructive and forward looking  relationships in. Asia and the Pacific have been expanded.

However, events in Indo-China, Iran, Afghanistan, and many  parts of Africa, demonstrate the volatility of the present  international situation. These new areas of tension contain  the potential for wider conflicts, and the possibility of the  direct involvement of the great powers. .  .

The Government has for some time identified the position in  Indo-China as deteriorating and potentially dangerous. There  is no satisfaction in knowing that events have proved us  right. .

Prior to the fighting between Vietnam and China we made known  our concern to a number of governments about the dangers  inherent in the situation. In my discussions with President  Carter in January and Prime Minister Desai later that month,  we spoke about the situation in Indo-China and about the

need to exercise an influence in reducing the tensions there.

Subsequently,  the Foreign Minister and myself conveyed our  concern to heads of both aligned and non-aligned nations in  Europe, North America, Asia, Africa and the Pacific. We sought  then, and still seek to contribute to restraining the actions

of the protagonists, and to relieve tension in the area.

Although China has indicated that it will act with prudence,   there must be no underestimation of the serious danger posed .  . to our region and the world by the present conflict between  China and Vietnam. Â·

Australia has a vital interest in China and Vietnam swiftly and  peacefully settling their differences. We call on Vietnam to  withdraw its forces from Kampuchea, and on China to withdraw  its forces from Vietnam. '  '  Ã¢ÂÂ   "

.  .  .  .  We have already asked the U.S.S.R. to use its special relationship with Vietnam to bring about a cease-fire  and withdrawal of Vietnamese forces from Kampuchea.  Pol Pot's  regime horrified the world. -Vietnam's invasion of Kampuchea  cannot be condoned. Â· The Australian Government cannot accept the use of force for  the settlement of disputes, whatever their cause. No-one

can be certain of the course that the conflict in Indo-China  will take. It is our earnest hope however tha.t every opportunity  will be taken to halt the fighting and settle the matter  peacefully.

The disturbances in Iran, the instability in the Horn of  Africa and Afghanistan, also have important implications for  Australia. Iran, a country of major international significance  because of its energy resources and geopolitical position has  undergone.a violent upheaval.. A new government has Â·  '  '  .

now been installed.

Western governments have made clear their wish for continued  good relations with Iran and their hope thatÂ· after a period  of great difficulty and uncertainty for the Iranian people Â·   and the region, stability and security will now return. We cannot be sure whether this will be so.

This changing political and strategic situation affects a  number ofÂ· important Western and regional interests. .  Supplies  of energy are involved,  as are our lines of communication with  major oil producing regions, and trade routes could be affected.

In addition to these new sources of concern,:other long standing  international difficulties remain unresolved. At the last  Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting, it was hoped that  Zimbabwe would be seated as a newly independent nation at the  next. Commonwealth meeting. We would have warmly welcomed that,  but now we know it will not occur.  .  We still hope that

there will be a peaceful transition to majority rule in Zimbabwe,   but the longer this is delayed the more difficult it will be.

In South Africa, tensions continue. In Namibia, the transition  to independence on a peaceful basis depends very much on the  supervision of that country's elections for its first government  by a generally acceptable international force. As I announced,  my Government has decided that it will make a contribution to

the U.N. peace-keeping force, for Namibia.

Southern Africa is a region of considerable strategic importance  to Australia--indeed to the entire free world. We ought to do  what we reasonably can to promote conditions there which will  bring about stability and security.  The Western initiative

on Namibia offers the opportunity for this. A successful

.  ../3

conclusion to the problem of Namibia should give renewed . hope chat other African problems can be resolved by Â· reasonable means.  .  .

The changes in the world have led'  the Government to call as  a matter of urgency for a full assessment of how recent  events affect Australia's strategic situation. It is  important to obtain such an assessment if we are to .  .

ensure that our Defence forces are adequate to cope with the  problems ahead.  .  .

The assessment will provide the basis for the Government’s  decisions on the type and capacity of Australia's Defence  forceÂ»  It is imperative that Australia assess the  consequences of the changes in the world situation for '

itself and its'Western and regional partners.  .

In view Of recent events and in anticipation.of the outcome . ’  of the strategic review, the Government has already taken  decisions involving a greater rate of Defence  expenditure than in the last Budget.  .

In the past three years greater emphasis has been given to the  purchases of new Defence equipment. Over this period orders Ã¢ÂÂ    have been placed for a number of major items of Defence  equipment, including three guided missile frigates (FFG's)  which are to. enter service progressively from 1981; construction

in Australia of the 6,000 tonne amphibious heavy-lift ship,  H.M.A.S. Tobruk; construction in Australia of 14 patrol.boats;   twelve C130H Hercules medium transport aircraft, which have  already entered service; modification of four F111C aircraft

to provide a reconnaissance capability; two P3C long range  maritime patrol aircraft; 1,200 additional light general  service trucks to improve mobility.

Estimated Defence expenditure on capital equipment for the  Armed Services this financial year is 12.9 percent of total  defence outlays,  compared with expenditure of 4.8 percent in  1975. Current planning is for increased expenditure on

capital equipment items to enhance the capability and  effectiveness of the Defence forces. While this has placed  some pressure on some areas of the Defence infrastructure,   the proposed acquisitions will enhance the operational  effectiveness of the Defence forces.

In the kind of world we are living in, it is all the more '   important for nations of good will, which have learnt the .   art of compromise through their own Democratic processes,  which are committed to consensus and reconciliation rather

than confrontation,  to carry those principles into international  affairs.  Â·  '

We share this commitment to moderation with India, which  speaks for moderation as a founder and leader of the non-  aligned movement. By speaking for moderation from our  aligned and non-aligned positions the cause of peace and  co-operation will be strengthened.

. ../4

Prime Minister Desai and I agreed during my visit to India  that further developing the relations between our two  countries and working together more closely will help in '   creating an atmosphere conducive to co-operation rather than  confrontation among nations. If we are to have a passion  in international affairs, let that passion be for moderation.

I have only sketched in outline the disturbing changes which  have taken place and the danger they hold. Early in the  session, the Foreign Minister will be making a major statement  which will deal at some length with the international .

situation and the Government's actions. The statement will  provide the House with a full opportunity for debate. '

Against the sombre background in international affairs, I  now want to turn to the situation here in Australia. The  Government has over the past three years pursued relentlessly  a policy aimed at restoring Australia to a position of

economic strength. Such strength is important if we are  to play an effective role in our region and in world councils;  if we are to meet Australia's aspirations; if we are to have  the resources to provide effective aid to those in need, and

enhance the well-being of all Australians. A strong and  prosperous Australian economy is vital if we are to achieve  the goals we all share.

There, is a growing and justifiable mood of optimism about  Australia’s economic prospects. After three years of firm  and steady economic management inflation has been reduced, . employment is shewing the first signs of recovery, the money

supply has been brought under control, Commonwealth Government,  spending has been curbed, interest rates have been lowered, . business and consumer confidence is stronger. .

I believe that 1979 is the year in which the fruits of our  policies will become clearly apparent, a year in which the  economy will take a further step on the road of recovery. However, despite our success in reducing inflation, it must

come down further. And, although there are now signs that  employment trends are changing for the better, the level of  unemployment remains a matter of the gravest concern to this  Government, in particular the level of unemployment among our Ã¢ÂÂ    young people. Ã¢ÂÂ

But there is no easy way out, no simple solution to the problems  of unemployment. By strengthening the foundations of our '  . economy, this Government is taking the most realistic, effective  and concerned approach towards providing more jobs for Australians

There are increasing grounds for optimism. The signs of  economic progress can be seen in many areas. Official  forecasts indicate that the growth in Gross Domestic  .Product in 1978-79 will be greater than for some years.

Production strengthened in the December quarter, and business  surveys predict that this will continue in 1979. Consumer .   demand is encouraging, with the high level of retail sales  in December reflecting a mood of growing confidence. .

. ../5

Private investment is growing strongly.  .Investment m  pianc  and machinery is much above last year's. Private non-dwelling  investments grew' by almost six percent in real terms in the  year ending with.the September quarter 1973, the latest period

for which final figures are available.

The outlook for housing is showing signs of improvement.'   Private dwelling approvals were up by almost 13 percent in  the December quarter,  and for several months the rate of.  lending for housing has been high. '

1978-79 will be a year of much improved prosperity for the'  rural sector. The gross value of wheat production for the  current wheat crop is $1900 million,  compared  with $925 million for the 1977-78 crop. ‘ With the wheat crop

almost completely harvested, Australian Wheat Board receivals  should exceed 17 million tonnes.  This is over 20 percent more  than the previous record set in 1968-69, and double last year’s  figure.

For beef, world prices have increased strongly over the past  year and are expected to remain at high levels. Beef exports  to our major markets are expected to rise in 1979. '

This is a welcome .relief for the industry, which had been ' through some disastrous years because of drought and low prices and despite the recent upturn beef auction prices have not increased as much as the C.P.I. For the wool industry,

the Bureau of Agricultural Economics forecasts a 9 percent rise in sale proceeds for 19 7 8-79.. .  ,  .  Â·  .

The Bureau also expects that the returns from grain crops will  increase greatly,  the value of sheep and lamb slaughterings Ã¢ÂÂ  will rise by 18 percent. Overall, farm incomes are expected  to .increase by at least 80 percent on their 1977-7 8 levels,   but this is admittedly from a low base. .

These higher incomes will allow many farmers to repay debts,   update their capital equipment and make farm, improvements which  have been impossible in the lean years. All Australians will  benefit from the rural sector's increased demand for goods and

services.

During the last election campaign I said that Austalia was ready .   to go with $6,000 million worth of investment. Since then,  as the latest Bureau of Statistics surveys indicate, an  estimated $3.4 billion was spent on investment in mining and  manufacturing in 1978, 33 percent up on the previous year.

In addition to that, the latest survey of industry and commerce  shows that right now $7.5 billion investment projects around  Australia are either ready to go or in their final feasibility  stages. .  '  Â·

To aid investment, we have approved $1.8 billion of infrastructure  financing for projects selected by the States. The projects  which the infrastructure is intended to support will involve  many times this amount.  For example,  the projects associated

with the $75 million infrastructure financing of the Hay Point .   coal loader will total $620 million, and infrastructure financing  of $41 million will assist the $700 million Worsley Alumina  Project. Arrangements of finance for a number of these proposals

is already at an advanced stage.

We would expect New South Wales to be in a position to make  an announcement about the Eraring Electricity Project financing  quite soon. .  .../6

Arrangements for finance from overseas sources for the next*  stage of the massive Loy Yang Electricity Project in Victoria, .   a project in which substantial progress has already been made,   is also at an advanced stage.  Considerable progress has  been made in securing overseas financing for a number of other

projects which were approved.

The States' willingness to support these projects demonstrates  the confidence that State Governments,  regardless of their  political complexion, have in Australia’s economic future under.   this Government's policies.

There is a resurgence of investment in large scale resource  development projects.  New capital investment in mining was  75 percent higher in the year to September, and the latest  AMIC survey showed that larger mining companies expect to '

increaseÂ·their investment by a further 32 percent in 1979.  Compare this with the stifling of development between 1972 ' .  and" 197 5. .  '

By contrast, as at December 197 8 the estimated capital cost . . of mineral projects firmly committed or in the final feasibility  stage was $4,000 million.  This figure does not include the  Northwest Shelf which is now being proved up in $50 million

feasibility study. It does include the following recently  announced projects:  the Gladstone Aluminium Smelter - $500 million; the Alcoa Alumina Project - $200 million; the Ranger Uranium  Project - $300 million. I should also add that quite apart from

this total of $4,000 million, the Premier of N.S.W. has said that  Alumax will go ahead with a $500 million aluminium smelter .   at Newcastle. . .  .  '

The ever-growing list of exciting new projects shows how  investors respond to stable,  responsible economic management,  and a government which faces up to economic realities. The  oil industry’s response to our policies is a prime example of

the success of our approach. Our measures encourage the search  for oil and,  equally importantly, encourage the efficient  development and use of our existing reserves.

Impetus has been given to the oil industry by our prude oil  pricing policies and taxation and investment incentives. As a result, Australia's oil reserves have been upgraded by  some 500 to 700 million barrels, approximately a further three

year supply at current consumption levels. The acceleration  of oil exploration activity will continue in 1979.

Industry estimates that between 83 and 143 exploration wells  could be drilled this year. Achievement of even the lower end  would be the best result for seven years. Esso and BHP alone  are committed to investing over $1 billion in exploration and  development over the next five years. Overall, by 1985, it is  estimated- that about 30 percent of Australia’s crude oil production  will be derived from oil fields which have become viable as a

consequence of our oil and gas policies.

This revival of exploration activity is of vital importance if  we are to maintain a satisfactory level of self-sufficiency  in oil into the 1980s and beyond.  Political disturbances in Iran  are not expected to affect significantly the availability of

petroleum products in Australia over the first half of 1979. The  outlook beyond then is uncertain, a fact which reminds us of the  added security that accompanies a high level ofÂ· self-sufficiency and the necessity for this Government's oil policies.

The renewed confidence in Australia as a sound place to invest  is not only limited to investment in our resources. In recent  weeks major new investments in other areas have been announced.  ICI has announced that it will construct a $500 million

petrochemical complex in Victoria and a $400 million ethylene  plant at Botany Bay. GMH is planning a new $210 million  engine complex based in Victoria, and its proposal is being  examined at the present time. Australian Newsprint Limited  have announced that they will construct a $160 million  newsprint plant at Albury-Wodonga.  Manufacturing industry

is participating in the revival of economic activity in Â· Australia. .  Ã¢ÂÂ   .  Â·  Ã¢ÂÂ

Because of the renewed confidence in manufacturing industry,  we have seen the first tentative signs of growth in manufacturing  employment in five years. The reduction in inflation arising  from our economic policies has dramatically improved the

competitiveness of Australian firms. Australia is more  competitive than at any time in the last seven years.  In  the December quarter, manufactured exports were 29 percent Ã¢ÂÂ  higher than for the previous December quarter.

In Australia, order books are filling up. BHP1s recent  profit announcement reflects in part a much better performance  for their steel sales within Australia. '  Our manufacturers are  showing an increasing ability to compete against imports. Ã¢ÂÂ

Australia's external position is improving. The reduction of .   inflation arising from our firm economic policies has . dramatically improved Australia.'s international competitiveness.  Contracts are being written for products, and in markets, that  would have seemed beyond reach only a few years ago.

Total exports were 17 percent higher in the three months ended  January 1979 than in the previous three months, while the  growth in imports was only seven percent. The improvement  in our exports has been reflected in a strengthening in the

trade account.

A.ustralia still faces difficulties with .the E.E.C. and there '   is a continuing need to negotiate for better access, but we  do have better, and more secure access to Japan. Our markets in Korea are growing. This year we have achieved

the best access ever to the U.S. for our meat exports, and '   we are approaching the end of the bilateral negotiations for  long term access to the American market. We are diversifying  our markets. Australians are penetrating the new and important  markets emerging in China, South East Asia, and the Middle East.

Australian exporters are being encouraged by a package of  Government measures, but ultimately it is the containment of'  inflation that provides the best stimulus for exporters, the  best incentive to take advantage of the market access which  has been won.

.  . ./8

The many signs of. economic progress will encourage all . Australians.  But I emphasise that .much remains to be done.  . We must consolidate the gains that have been won.  In so  doing there is no room for taking easy options, for relenting

in the pursuit of policies which, however difficult they may  be in the short run, are in the end the only policies that  can keep us on the road to full prosperity and higher employment.

In particular we must defeat inflation. The trend on this  front can be clearly seen. In 1978 inflation was down to  7.8 percent, compared with 9.3 percent in the previous year. By comparison, the CPI reached 17.5 percent over the year

to March 1975. The result for 1978 would have been better . but for two factors: the Government's necessary and farÂ­ sighted move to establish world parity prices for oil; and  the increases in food, particularly beef prices, which are

reviving large sectors of a rural industry that has b e e n ,   depressed for many years. Given these two factors, the  fall in inflation from 9.3 percent in 1977, to 7.8 percent'  in 1978 is a significant success. .  .

The Government's success in winding back inflation has been  a precondition for the substantial progress in reducing .   interest rates. Long term bond rates have fallen by about  1.4 percent since interest rate reductions began some 18 Â· months ago. In 1978 housing rates fell by one per cent. This is most significant progress, especially since while  our interest rates fell over 1978 (J.S. interest ratesÂ· were rising  by up t o '4 percent, those in the U.K.  by up to 5 percent.

This progress reflects the strengthening confidence in .   Australia's economic policies and in the Australian dollar.

Over the last two or three months we have seen, some  encouraging signs of increasing employment. These are . tentative early signs but they all point in the same direction.

Civilian employment has risen in each of the five months  to November"1978, the first time this has occurred for  five years. In October and November 1978 employment in ' maufacturing increased - the largest increase, over these

two months for five, years. Overtime has risen each month.   for the last seven months to the the highest level since 1974.

Similarly, the trend for new vacancies notified to the . C.E.S. shows a more heartening picture. These encouraging signs  reflect the results of our policies and the increasing  competitiveness of Australian industry. .  Ã¢ÂÂ

It is one of the anomalies in the current situation that '  Â· despite the level of unemployment many employers maintain they cannot, get enough labour. In this situation the Government has adopted wide ranging policicies to help the unemployed

and particularly the young unemployed,  who are sometimes unable to take advantage of job opportunities when they are available.  .

. ../9

ZJ

More than 400,000 people have been helped by such  Government programmes over the past three years and we .   are reviewing training, retraining and relocation schemes  to ensure that they are as efficient and effective

as possible.

.  To build on the emerging signs of improvement on the . employment front, we must continue to bear down on ' inflation and there must be wage restraint.  The  Government remains concerned about the magnitude of wage

increases granted by the Arbitration Commission but we  believe the move to six-monthly national wage hearings is  an important step in the right direction. .  .

We welcome statements such as that made by the President  of the A.C.T.U.: the trade union movement has "a responsibility  in respect of those who are not in the workforce".  This  recognition holds out real prospects of constructive

cooperation between Government, trade unions and industry  which is fundamental to a real and lasting increase in  employment opportunities.  It is also necessary for  manufacturers to be restrained in the prices that they

establish.  As production improves,  manufacturers will have  higher throughput and lower unit costs and an opportunity  to contain price rises. .

It should be noted that the PJT has the capacity to enquire  into and keep under surveillance prices in specific areas  and the Act still provides that companies can be required  to notify price rises for 12 months following a public  inquiry by the PJT.  .

I have pointed to a number of areas where the economy  is moving ahead. While we must treat these signs with  caution, the optimism in our industries,  the resurgence of  investment and development in mining and manufacturing,   the revitalised position of our rural industries, some  rising commodity prices, the signs of new trends in employment  and the balance of trade, give Australia firm grounds for  confidence.

After three years of steady policies directed at overcoming  inflation and rebuilding the economy, the signs of  progress are clear. Australia is on the right course,   we will stay on that course.
