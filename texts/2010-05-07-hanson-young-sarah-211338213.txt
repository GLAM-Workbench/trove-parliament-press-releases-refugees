Govt Must Support Independent Assessment of  Detention in Budget





The Federal Government must acknowledge the consequences of its new policies on  asylum-seekers by providing specific funding in next week’s Budget for independent assessment of  conditions in Immigration Detention facilities, according to Greens Senator Sarah Hanson-Young.

Senator Hanson-Young, Greens spokesperson on Immigration and Human Rights, says the decision  to suspend the processing of claims from Sri Lankans and Afghanis, as well as the re-opening of the  remote Curtin detention facility, reinforces the importance of incorporating funding into the cost of  running, for independent organisations and bodies to conduct routine assessments of the  conditions.

“The Government has changed its policy, and now must provide the appropriate resources to deal  with the consequences of returning to indefinite detention,’’ Senator Hanson-Young said.

“Any independent assessment must be considered as part of the normal running and operation of  detention centres under its new regime.’’

When the Rudd Government was elected, it promised greater transparency in the running of  immigration detention. Given the Government’s insistence on indefinite detention using these  isolated centres, the Greens believe it is even more critical to have transparency in the way these  centres are operated and the conditions people face.

“Specific money must be set aside in the Federal Budget to allow offices and organisations such as  the Ombudsman and the Australian Human Rights Commission to carry out the assessment of  conditions and treatment of asylum-seekers, and to be able to report back their findings to the  public,’’ Senator Hanson-Young said.

“We can’t allow detention to take place out of sight, out of mind any more. The bottom line is that  the Government cannot be trusted to uphold Australia’s international obligations on  asylum-seekers, and ensuring there is an independent body we can trust to monitor the conditions  and report publicly on its findings, is essential.’’
