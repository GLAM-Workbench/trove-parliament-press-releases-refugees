FRED WILLIAMS

Fred Williams was our greatest contemporary landscape

artist.

His death, at the relatively early age of 55, is a great

loss to the Australian art world.

He captured on canvas the essential spirit of the Ã¢ÂÂ

Australian countryside.

As the first Australian to be honoured with a one-man

show at the New Yor& Museum of Modern Art, Fred Williams

did much to change the way in which the Australian bush

is perceived overseas. .

His contributions to art did not end with his own

paintings.

For many years he served on the Council of .the Australian

National Gallery, and was a driving force behind-the .

new National Gallery Building in Canberra. _  Ã¢ÂÂ

I offer my deepest sympathy to his widow and family.
