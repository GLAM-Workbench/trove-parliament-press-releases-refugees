MEDIA RELEASE  MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS  ALEXANDER DOWNER

October 5 2004

Securing Australia’s interests

Only a re-elected Howard Coalition Government can secure Australia’s interests by taking a strong  stand against terrorism in co-operation with our neighbours and allies.

A Coalition Government will continue to lead co-operative efforts combating terrorism in our region,  will stay the course to support freedom in Iraq and be a reliable ally to our partners.

Now is not the time to ignore the global, as well as regional, threat of terrorism. Now is not the time to  abandon Iraq to terrorists and embolden extremists everywhere.

Now is not the time to downgrade the American alliance. The alliance is a manifestation of our shared  values and is vital in an era of global terrorist threats, WMD proliferation and failed states. Access to  US intelligence resources, leading defence technology and other support provides unrivalled assistance  in facing these challenges.

The Coalition Foreign Policy released today builds on our firm understanding that Australia is a  significant country - rather than the “middle-sized” or “small” country Labor portrays.

We have a significant role to play in international affairs and in the security of our region. We have  shown leadership through co-hosting with Indonesia a regional summit on counter terrorism,  establishing the Jakarta Centre for Law Enforcement Co-operation and by signing MOUs on counter  terrorism with nine of our regional neighbours.

The Coalition has already committed $15 million to counter terrorism programs in Indonesia and the  Philippines.  A re-elected Coalition Government will double this over five years.

We will expand work with regional Muslim communities to help win the battle of ideas against the  extremists. We will co-host with Indonesia a regional inter-faith dialogue.

We will establish an Australia-Malaysia Institute and an Australia-Thailand Institute, building  understanding between peoples and institutions, as through the Australia Indonesia Institute.

The Coalition gives the highest priority to Australia’s November attendance in Laos at the first  ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand summit. This marks the beginning of work towards an ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand free trade agreement.

Astonishingly, Labor’s Foreign Policy statement barely acknowledges this landmark event. The  Coalition is deepening engagement with the region while strengthening our relationship with our most  important security ally, the United States.

Securing Australia’s Interests 1

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Australia is a liberal democracy with a proud commitment  to political and economic freedom.  The Coalition  Government’s foreign policy rests on a clear  understanding of the fundamental values of the Australian  people, the role they wish us to play in international  relations and what they want our country to stand for.

The Coalition’s approach to international affairs is  characterised by a realistic grasp of how the world works,  of the strategic circumstances that define our times, and  of Australia’s place in the international system.

Australia has a strong and unique identity and a  distinctive culture.  We respond confidently to the  challenges and opportunities of globalisation.

Australia’s interests are global in nature and not always  defined by geography.  We are a Western country located  in the Asia-Pacific region, with close ties and affinities  with North America and Europe and active engagement  throughout Asia.  Under the Coalition Government,  Australia is playing a forward-looking role in world affairs  while ensuring national security and prosperity.

Australia faces an uncertain world.  The threat of  terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass  destruction and failed and failing states are the key  foreign policy challenges of our time.  The terrorist  attacks of 11 September 2001 in the United States and  12 October 2002 in Bali were defining events for Australia  and the world.  These events changed Australia's security  environment in significant ways.

At the same time, traditional security concerns remain.   The Asia-Pacific region is still home to eight of the world's  ten largest armies and, after the Middle East, the world's  three most volatile flashpoints - the Taiwan Strait, the  Korean peninsula and Kashmir.

SECURING THE FUTURE



The challenges Australia faces demand a coherent and  effective foreign policy.  The Government has responded  resolutely to these challenges and focuses on practical  outcomes to secure Australia’s future.

Securing Australia’s Interests 2

We are well placed to respond to these challenges.  Our  international standing is high, a result of the Coalition  Government’s strong and principled foreign policy.  The  respect Australia commands can be attributed to:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Our consistently strong economic performance  and major trade and investment links with  Asia, the United States, Western Europe, New  Zealand and the Middle East;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Our leadership in East Timor;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Our strong and cooperative stand against  terrorism;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The highly professional contribution that our  military personnel made to the war in  Afghanistan and in Iraq;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Benefits from our close defence alliance with  the United States and important intelligence  links with key partners;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Our creative and decisive intervention in the  Solomon Islands to halt its slide towards a  failed state;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Recognition of our willingness to pull our  weight internationally; and

Ã¢ÂÂ¢  Our  strong  people-to-people links extending  throughout the Asia-Pacific and around the  world.



The Coalition Government has taken the tough but  necessary decisions to protect Australia’s borders and  enhance Australians’ security at home and abroad.  We  will continue this work.  At this critical time, Australia  cannot afford the Labor Party’s empty rhetoric, its  posturing, or its retreat into the past.



PART 1  SECURITY FOR AUSTRALIANS

Australia must pursue its national interests in a fluid and  uncertain international environment.  While Australia’s  alliance relationships remain fundamental to our security,  the challenges they must address have become more  complex.  The Coalition will continue to confront the  threat of terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of  mass destruction with action and resolve.  Australia and  its partners in the wider international community have  made substantial progress in the war on terror, but there  is no room for complacency.

Securing Australia’s Interests 3

PART 2  FORGING STRONGER PARTNERSHIPS WITH ASIA

Close engagement with the countries of Asia is an  abiding priority in the Coalition’s foreign and trade policy.   The Coalition will continue to emphasise important  economic and trade links, valuable diplomatic and  security relationships, and growing people to people links  in our engagement with Asia.  The Government has  secured ASEAN agreement to the first summit meeting  and to commence negotiations for an FTA.



PART 3  MAINTAINING OUR STRONG ALLIANCE WITH THE US

Australia’s security, economic and political ties with the  United States are fundamental to our future.  The  Coalition Government will work to strengthen our ties with  the world’s richest and most powerful country.  The most  recent example of the Coalition’s commitment to the US  alliance was the passage of the Australia US Free Trade  Agreement (FTA), a development which will benefit this  and future generations.



PART 4  OUR PACIFIC NEIGHBOURS

The Coalition Government has accepted a particular  responsibility to help South Pacific countries manage  their serious and endemic problems, many of which have  been exacerbated by poor governance.  Our more  interventionist policy will help these states deliver better  governance.  The Coalition will continue to work closely  with New Zealand, an important partner in the region and  beyond.



PART 5  RELATIONS WITH OTHER KEY REGIONS

The Coalition Government continues to seek closer  dialogue and cooperation with the European Union (EU).   Strong bilateral links with EU member states, particularly  the United Kingdom, complement our dealings with the  EU.  The Coalition will continue to strengthen Australia’s  relationships with the countries of the Middle East.  Trade  and economic ties have grown strongly, reinforced by  Australia’s commitment to the region’s security through  Coalition action in Iraq and peace keeping operations.



Securing Australia’s Interests 4



PART 6  GLOBAL CHALLENGES

The Coalition Government will continue our active  involvement in multilateral forums to advance our national  interest in key areas.  Efforts to promote human rights will  continue to be practically focussed, eschewing  megaphone diplomacy, driven by action and genuine  dialogue.  We will continue to respond to the challenges  of transnational crime through international co-operation  and the greater integration of diplomatic, law  enforcement, aid, trade and defence policies.  Building on  the success of its decisive action to protect Australia’s  borders, the Coalition will maintain its vigorous campaign  against the crimes of people smuggling and people  trafficking.



P ART 7  IMPROVED AID TO SECURE A BETTER FUTURE

Australia’s aid programme will continue as an integral  part of our broader efforts to promote regional  development and stability.  It will retain a strong focus on  alleviating poverty and encouraging good governance.   Our aid programme helps build more prosperous and  secure countries, which is in the interests of all  Australians.



P ART 8  LOOKING AFTER AUSTRALIANS ABROAD

In an uncertain international environment, the welfare of  Australians travelling abroad will remain the highest  priority for the Coalition Government.

Securing Australia’s Interests 5

PART 1  S ECURITY FOR AUSTRALIANS

(i)  The War on Terror



Australia is a target of transnational extremist-Muslim terrorism.  This  was demonstrated with the 11 September 2001 attacks in the United  States, the Bali bombings of 12 October 2002 and, most recently, the  Jakarta bombing of 9 September 2004.  In these events 98 Australians  were killed.

As a Western democracy we are a target because of our beliefs and  what our society represents.  Our values of peace, religious freedom,  liberty and tolerance put us squarely in the terrorists’ sights.

However, the scourge of terrorism will not be defeated quickly or easily.   It is an enduring campaign and a war we must win.

The Coalition Government understands this and remains resolute in its  prosecution of the war on terror.  On 15 July 2004 the Government  launched Australia’s first White Paper on the threat from international  terrorism.  The White Paper details the nature and international  dimensions of the evolving terrorist threat to Australia and Australians  and the action the Government has taken in Australia’s counter-terrorism campaign.

The Coalition Government has introduced wide ranging and tough  domestic measures.  Internationally we have committed Australian  forces in Afghanistan and enhanced regional police and intelligence  cooperation with key partners, particularly in the Asia Pacific.

Since 11 September 2001, Australia has signed nine bilateral Counter  Terrorism MOUs in our region and established high-level bilateral  Counter Terrorism dialogues with the United States and Japan. In  March 2003 the Coalition Government appointed an Ambassador for  Counter-Terrorism, intensifying the Government's international efforts  to combat terrorism.

In February 2004 Australia and Indonesia co-hosted a Ministerial  Counter-Terrorism Meeting where 25 countries agreed to a series of  practical measures to strengthen regional counter-terrorism in critical  areas such as law enforcement, information sharing and legal  frameworks.  The Coalition Government also contributed $36.8 million  to help establish the Jakarta Centre for Law Enforcement Co-operation.   Opened in July 2004, the Centre has both an operational and a  capacity-building mandate in combating terrorism in the region.

Securing Australia’s Interests 6

This Ministerial Meeting built on a very successful Regional  Conference on Money Laundering and Anti-Terrorist Financing co-hosted by Australia and Indonesia in December 2002.

The Coalition Government has provided counter-terrorism assistance  packages to Indonesia ($10 million) and the Philippines ($5 million),  and built on existing operational relations with other countries.  ASIO  and the AFP have dramatically expanded their relations with partner  countries.  AFP cooperation with Indonesia was crucial to the  successful arrest and trial of the Bali bombers.

The Government recognises that the campaign against transnational  extremist-terrorism involves a contest of ideas.  These terrorists seek  to use religion to justify their actions.  Australia has strongly supported  the great majority of Muslims in their efforts to draw distinctions  between their faith and the rhetoric of extremists who advocate  transnational terrorism.  The Government has encouraged tolerance  and respect for the Muslim community.  All faiths must be able to  participate in society without fear or prejudice.

The efforts of Australia and its regional and international partners have  led to substantial progress in the war on terror, including:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Defeat of two regimes that have supported terrorism - the  Taliban in Afghanistan and Saddam Hussein in Iraq;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢  Capture  or  killing  of 65 per cent of al-Qaeda’s leadership  and the detention of over 3,000 people connected to al-Qaeda since September 11.  Al-Qaeda cells have been  disrupted on every continent and its remaining leadership,  denied sanctuary and freedom of movement in  Afghanistan, has been dispersed;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Detention of more than 300 suspected Jemaah Islamiyah  members, including such key figures as Hambali;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Seizure or freezing of around $285 million in terrorist  assets around the world since 11 September 2001; and

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Assisting Indonesia to track down and bring to justice the  key perpetrators of the Bali bombing.



The Coalition Government will continue to contribute decisively towards  the defeat of terrorism in the region.  The Coalition will:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Double our counter terrorism assistance to Indonesia and  the Philippines providing Indonesia $20 million for counter  terrorism programs over five years and the Philippines  $10 million over five years.  This will be met through  existing programs;

Securing Australia’s Interests 7

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Build on the nine bilateral counter-terrorism MOUs that  have been established;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Develop initiatives under the Joint Australia-ASEAN  Declaration to Combat International Terrorism signed on  1 July 2004;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Continue to enhance regional law enforcement  cooperation;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Utilise our vital intelligence sharing relationship with the US  and the UK and other key partners;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Continue co-operation with the region including maritime  and transport security; and

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Work with the Muslim community to help win the battle of  ideas against the extremist-Muslim terrorists including co-host with Indonesia a regional inter-faith dialogue.



(ii)  The Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction

The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction is a serious security  challenge to the international community.  Decisive action is needed to  stop rogue states and middlemen engaged in the black market trade in  WMD technologies and expertise.  This trade, if not stopped, could put  WMD into the hands of terrorists.

The Coalition Government has been at the forefront of efforts to  combat the proliferation of WMD and related technology.

Our efforts in Iraq helped eliminate the threat posed by Saddam  Hussein’s regime which had conclusively demonstrated, by its defiance  of the international community and no fewer than 17 UN Security  Council Resolutions, that it never intended to give up its WMD  ambitions.

The Coalition Government has committed Australia to a key role in the  Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI).  The PSI is developing practical  measures to impede, disrupt and stop the illicit trade in WMD-related  materials, technologies and delivery systems.  It clearly demonstrates  the international community’s resolve to stop WMD proliferation by  rogue states.

The Coalition has taken responsible steps to reduce the threat of  missile attack through Australia’s participation in ballistic missile  defence.  This defensive measure will deter rogue states from  acquiring and developing ballistic missiles, thus making the world a  safer place for us all.





Securing Australia’s Interests 8

Participation in the PSI and missile defence complements the Coalition  Government’s commitment to multilateral disarmament and counter-proliferation treaties.  Australia has taken a lead in international  responses to key proliferation issues, including those relating to Iran  and North Korea.  We will consider further practical measures to  strengthen treaties and their verification systems.

To ensure that multilateral institutions are effective in dealing with the  new challenges we face, the Government will pursue new strategies for  disarmament, focusing on outcomes rather than talkfests.

A re-elected Coalition Government will:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Continue to support and develop the Proliferation Security  Initiative;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Support Australian participation, including by local  industries, in ballistic missile defence; and

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Help strengthen global counter-proliferation architecture  through tighter enforcement and verification of multilateral  rules on sensitive technologies, and support for practical  measures to enhance development and enforcement of  regional export control regimes.





PART 2  FORGING STRONGER PARTNERSHIPS WITH ASIA

(i)  North Asia



North Asia, including Japan, China and the Korean Peninsula, takes  almost 45 per cent of Australia’s exports and offers Australia enormous  opportunities for the future.  It also contains some of the most difficult  diplomatic challenges confronting Australia.  In North Asia the interests  of key global powers, the US, Japan and China, intersect and shape  the security environment.  Their relationships with each other are  fundamental to Australia’s security interests.

Australia has major economic and security interests at stake in Japan.   The world’s second largest economy, Japan is our largest export  market.  Australia’s security links with Japan are becoming increasingly  important as the constitutional and political constraints on Japan’s  security policies are gradually loosened.

The Coalition Government will:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Work to deepen security co-operation by building on the  success of the Trilateral Security Dialogue between the US,  Australia and Japan;

Securing Australia’s Interests 9

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Enhance our economic relationship and further benefit  Australian business by expanding our Trade and Economic  Framework agreement with Japan;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Encourage Japan to take a more active role in the region,  one more commensurate with its economic status; and

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Host the third round of the Australia-Japan Conference.



The rapid growth in China’s economic, political and strategic weight  will be one of the most important factors shaping Asia’s future.   Australia’s relationship with China has never been in better shape.  The  visit of President Hu Jintao, an historic LNG contract and the dramatic  expansion of trade, at a peak and increasing, clearly demonstrate this.   The Coalition Government has successfully managed relations in a  way that makes the most of our shared interests while acknowledging  our differences.  Australia’s one-China policy will remain a fundamental  element of our relations with China - just as it is fundamental to our  considerable economic ties with Taiwan.

The Coalition Government will:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Work to expand trade and investment ties with China,  notably through the joint Free Trade Agreement Feasibility  Study (to be concluded in the first half of 2005);

Ã¢ÂÂ¢  Encourage  the  further  development of defence exchanges  and second-track diplomacy;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Promote a peaceful resolution of the Taiwan issue; and

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Pursue further opportunities in the energy sector.



With the Korean Peninsula of considerable strategic importance to  Australia, our strong relationship with the Republic of Korea (ROK),  grounded firmly in economic ties and congruent security interests, is of  the utmost value.

The Coalition Government has worked hard to secure access to ROK  markets for Australian exporters, particularly in the energy sector.

A re-elected Coalition Government will focus our efforts on a peaceful  resolution to the problems on the Korean Peninsula.  We will continue  to favour a strategy which presses the Democratic People’s Republic  of Korea (DPRK) to achieve a permanent resolution of the nuclear  issue.  Australia would stand ready to co-operate more closely with the  DPRK should it take this step.







Securing Australia’s Interests 10

The Coalition will:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Continue to strengthen economic relations with South  Korea, identifying and improving opportunities for  Australian exports, such as LNG; and

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Continue to engage the DPRK in support of diplomatic  efforts, such as the six-party talks process, to stabilise the  situation on the Korean Peninsula.



(ii)  South East Asia



Australia has actively pursued its bilateral and regional relationships in  South East Asia and has vigorously supported the interests of a wide  range of Australian business interests.

Australia has a fundamental national interest in Indonesia’s stability.   The Coalition Government strongly supports Indonesian unity and  territorial integrity.

The Coalition Government has played a constructive role supporting  Indonesia during its transition to democracy, its pursuit of economic  reform and in its efforts to combat Islamic extremist terrorist groups  such as Jemaah Islamiyah.  The Coalition will continue to support the  development of a robust democratic system in Indonesia.

Our political relationship with Indonesia has moved on considerably  since 1999 when Australia led the INTERFET operation in East Timor.  Australia, Indonesia and East Timor now participate in an annual  Trilateral dialogue on issues of mutual interest.

The Coalition Government has pursued a high level of dialogue and  reciprocal visits with the Indonesian Government.  The June 2001 visit  by President Wahid was the first visit to Australia by an Indonesian  President since 1973.  Australia and Indonesia have co-hosted a  regional ministerial meeting on people smuggling, and a regional  counter-terrorism summit.  The last Australia Indonesia Ministerial  Forum, attended by 7 Australian ministers and 13 Indonesian ministers,  is a testament to the diversity and strength of the relationship.

The Coalition will:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Continue to develop law enforcement cooperation with  Indonesia on counter-terrorism and people smuggling;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Engage the Muslim community and support their role in  promoting pluralism and democracy in Indonesia and as a  voice of moderation against extremist-Muslim terrorists;

Securing Australia’s Interests 11

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Co-host with Indonesia an inter-faith dialogue involving   religious leaders from the region to share perspectives and  increase understanding among the faiths about key issues  of concern in the region, such as terrorism;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Continue high level dialogue with Indonesia to advance  mutual interests, including through the Australia Indonesia  Ministerial Forum;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Continue to support respect for democracy and human  rights within Indonesia;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Further assist Indonesia with its economic reform and  recovery efforts following the impacts of the Asian financial  crisis, SARS and the Bali bombings; and

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Continue to support Indonesia’s unity and territorial  integrity.



The Coalition Government has built a strong and wide ranging bilateral  relationship with Malaysia, in areas such as education, tourism and  science and technology.  Bilateral cooperation has also been expanded  to include counter-terrorism and people smuggling.

A re-elected Coalition Government will:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Work with the new Malaysian Government to further  develop stronger bilateral cooperation;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Convene the first senior officials political and security  dialogue;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Conduct a parallel scoping study of an FTA between  Australia and Malaysia; and

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Establish an Australia-Malaysia Institute to build  knowledge and understanding between the people and  institutions of Australia and Malaysia.  This will be met  through existing programs.



Under the Coalition Government, Australia and Singapore have co-operated and shared views on many regional and international issues.   A major achievement has been signature of the Singapore-Australia  Free Trade Agreement in February 2003.

A re-elected Coalition Government will:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Maintain regular high level dialogue with Singapore; and

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Continue to strengthen commercial and political ties.



Australia and Thailand enjoy strong bilateral and regional cooperation  including as partners in the war on terror. The Free Trade Agreement  cemented the foundation of our economic relations.

Securing Australia’s Interests 12

The Coalition Government will:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Continue to strengthen and broaden the bilateral  relationship; and

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Establish an Australia-Thailand Institute to enhance and  promote bilateral relations.  This will be met through  existing programs.



The Coalition Government is committed to achieving progress towards  democracy in Burma.  The Coalition Government will:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Maintain the suspension of human rights workshops  pending the release from house arrest of Daw Aung San  Suu Kyi and evidence of Burmese commitment to the  roadmap for democracy;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Continue to work with the international and regional  community to encourage Burmese commitment to  democracy and human rights; and

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Continue to address the basic needs of the Burmese  people through the delivery of humanitarian programmes.



The Philippines continues to be an important partner bilaterally and  regionally.  In March 2003 Australia and the Philippines signed a  bilateral MOU to Combat International Terrorism. The Prime Minister  committed $5 million to assist counter-terrorism activities.  This  package is already providing practical assistance to the Philippines in  important areas including port and immigration security.

East Timor is a young nation facing a challenging future.  The  Coalition Government will continue to provide substantial aid and  assistance to help East Timor meet these challenges.  Following a  meeting of Foreign Ministers in August, Australia and East Timor are  hopeful that negotiations concerning the maritime boundaries can be  completed by the end of this year.

This year Australia celebrates 20 years of diplomatic relations with  Brunei Darussalam.  Trade and investment ties continue to be an  important part of the bilateral relationship.  Australia and Brunei have  commenced work towards a bilateral Counter-Terrorism MOU.

Australia enjoys good bilateral relations with Vietnam, Cambodia and  Laos, with reciprocal high level visits, broad ranging bilateral agendas,  strong people to people links and cooperation on transnational issues  such as counter-terrorism and people-smuggling.  A re-elected  Coalition Government will build on these achievements.



Securing Australia’s Interests 13

(iii) South Asia



The ongoing liberalisation of India’s economy presents Australia with  important opportunities.  India is now our ninth largest export market.

The Coalition moved quickly to rectify Labor’s neglect of the bilateral  relationship with India establishing regular ministerial consultations,  senior officials talks and joint working groups.

A re-elected Coalition Government will:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Continue to build the political and strategic relationship;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Further strengthen our economic partnership;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Continue to hold annual ministerial level talks; and

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Assist Australian businesses to pursue the growing  economic opportunities offered by India.



The Coalition supports Pakistan’s moves towards full restoration of  constitutional democracy and its critical contribution in the war on  terror.  Recognising the importance of resolving tensions between  nuclear-armed India and Pakistan, the Coalition Government strongly  supports efforts towards the peaceful resolution of the Kashmir issue.

Australia has supported Afghanistan’s reconstruction following the  end of Taliban rule.  Since September 2001, we have committed more  than $110 million in humanitarian and reconstruction assistance to  Afghanistan - one of the largest single humanitarian contributions in  Australia’s history.  Australia recognises the importance of ensuring the  successful transition to democracy in Afghanistan, ensuring its people  can enjoy peace and prosperity after decades of war and misrule.

(iv) Asia Pacific Regional Institutions

The Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum (APEC) aims to  enhance economic cooperation and strengthen business interaction in  our region, thereby contributing to our common security.  It is valuable  to our interests in Asia and the Pacific and complements our bilateral  relationships in the region.

APEC has played an important role in the war on terror.  The APEC  Leaders’ Summit in October 2003 endorsed a range of Counter-Terrorism initiatives, including addressing the threat posed by  MANPADs (a class of weapons that can be used against aircraft), an  Australian-led aviation passenger information system and an Asian  Development Bank fund to assist APEC countries build CT capacity.



Securing Australia’s Interests 14

The Coalition will:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Continue to work with APEC to advance Australia’s  economic and strategic interests;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Help develop APEC’s capacity to enhance security across  the Asia Pacific region;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Advance the APEC structural reform process; and

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Ensure Australia successfully hosts APEC in 2007.



Our security, stability and prosperity, and that of our neighbours,  depends on how well we work together to advance our mutual  interests.  The Government has secured the first summit meeting with  ASEAN leaders to be held in Laos this November.  The Government  has secured also ASEAN agreement to begin negotiations on an FTA.

The ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) is the principal forum for security  dialogue in Asia.  It has made modest gains in building a sense of  strategic community and has contributed to the region’s counter-terrorism work.

A re-elected Coalition Government will:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Work to strengthen the ARF as the region’s principal  multilateral security forum;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Promote greater cooperation on CT issues through  further capacity-building and collaborative arrangements;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Support development of ARF preventive diplomacy  mechanisms;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Help strengthen the linkages between first and second-track processes; and

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Support efforts to enhance the role of ARF Chair.



The ASEAN PMC provides a forum for practical cooperation and  engagement with ASEAN countries.  Australia has proven itself a  reliable and constructive neighbour.

A re-elected Coalition Government will:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Continue to promote the ASEAN PMC process as a  means to promote greater regional cooperation and  practical engagement on issues of concern, including  counter-terrorism, people smuggling, Avian Influenza,  SARS, people trafficking, and landmine clearance;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢  Encourage  deeper  economic  integration, including  through commitment to the AFTA-CER Closer Economic  Partnership; and

Securing Australia’s Interests 15

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Increase people-to-people links in partnership with  ASEAN - through business, education, migration and  tourism.





PART 3  MAINTAINING AND BUILDING OUR STRONG  ALLIANCE WITH THE UNITED STATES

Australia’s longstanding partnership with the United States is  fundamentally important.  Strong security, economic and political ties  with the United States are vital to Australia’s future security and  prosperity.  The United States will remain the pre-eminent global power  for the foreseeable future, with no other country able to match its global  reach.  The Coalition Government has done much to strengthen  Australia’s influence and work with the United States.

Australia and the United States share values and ideals.  We both have  deep democratic traditions, elements of a common heritage and a  lasting record of cooperation and shared sacrifice.  The Coalition  Government will continue to stand up for our interests when our views  differ from those of the United States.  But the extent of our shared  interests offers great scope for our two countries to work together,  bilaterally and internationally, to achieve mutually beneficial outcomes.

Our security alliance is a practical manifestation of our shared values  and has particular significance in an era of global terrorist threats,  WMD proliferation and failed states.  Access to intelligence, leading  defence technology and other support is vital in meeting these  challenges.

The passage of the Australia US FTA, an achievement of historic and  strategic significance, will benefit current and future generations.  The  US economy accounts for about one-third of today’s global GDP, and  its flexible economy and youthful demographics will help it set the  agenda in terms of advanced technology and other key areas of the  world’s economic future.  The FTA will provide Australia access to a  rich market and an extraordinary source of goods, investment and  ideas.

The Coalition Government will further strengthen this pivotal bilateral  relationship by:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Bringing into force our Free Trade Agreement and building  on the economic opportunities it offers;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Working with our closest ally in the fight against  international terrorism;

Securing Australia’s Interests 16

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Implementing activities under the MOU with the US on  Missile Defence which will support US efforts to protect its  population, defence personnel and allied personnel from  the threat of ballistic missiles;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Pursuing further defence cooperation in key areas such as  the Joint Strike Fighter project;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Continuing to work behind the scenes to strengthen the  institutional framework of our intelligence partnership;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Continuing discussions in relation to the US force structure  review so as to take advantage of opportunities for  Australia, including enhancing ADF capabilities;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Concluding an Australia-US Science and Technology  Agreement;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Ensuring the US remains engaged in our region, promoting  future stability and prosperity in East Asia; and

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Building on the Climate Action Partnership.





PART 4  OUR PACIFIC NEIGHBOURS

Australia has a major interest in the security and good governance of  the countries of the South Pacific.  The Australian people, the  international community and the people of the Pacific themselves  believe that we have special responsibilities in this region.  Accordingly,  the Coalition Government has sought to play a constructive role in the  region, with much achieved since 1996.

Australia’s role in the South Pacific Islands has changed.  As the  threats to Australia from poor governance and declining law and order  in the Pacific have become clearer, the Coalition has moved to play a  more hands on role.  Australia is determined to make a difference,  increasingly working through the placement of Australian officials and  police to work side by side with local counterparts.

Australia’s leading role in the Regional Mission to Restore Peace and  Stability (RAMSI) in the Solomon Islands demonstrates our  determination to pursue a constructive, higher level of engagement.  In  an operation welcomed by the people of the Solomon Islands, and  hailed throughout the region, Australian Federal Police, supported by  the Australian Defence Force, have helped restore law and order - a  vital first step towards the restoration of good governance.

Securing Australia’s Interests 17

The Coalition places a strong emphasis on good governance,  countering corruption, strengthening regional institutions and  encouraging the pooling of regional resources.  The election of an  Australian in 2003 as Secretary-General of the Pacific Islands Forum  was a recognition of the qualities of the Australian candidate and an  endorsement of Australia’s approach to the region.

An investment in the economic viability, political stability and good  governance of neighbouring states is an investment in Australian  security.  The costs and potential threats to Australia of ignoring the  problems confronting the region are immense.

A re-elected Coalition Government will:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Make every effort to bring peace, stability and development  to the island states of the Pacific;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Ensure a measured transition in the Solomon Islands from  security stabilisation to economic and governance reform;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Encourage the sustainable economic growth of all nations  in the Pacific;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Promote the pooling of scarce regional resources in areas  such as transport and police training in line with the pooling  of aviation resources announced at the recent meeting of  the Pacific Islands Forum in Apia;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Work closely with the region’s police forces and  immigration services to boost the capacity of local law  enforcement and border security agencies; and

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Promote reform of the Pacific Islands Forum and its  secretariat so it can more effectively pursue the interests of  its membership.



The Coalition Government has taken decisive steps to ensure the more  sustainable development of Papua New Guinea.  The largest recipient  of Australian aid, Papua New Guinea continues to face major  economic, social and political challenges.

In December 2003 agreement was reached with Papua New Guinea  on an Enhanced Cooperation Programme designed to help address its  pressing law and order, economic management and governance  problems.

One of the most important achievements in Australia’s foreign policy  over the last decade has been our role in ending the long and bitter  civil war on Bougainville.  This was reflected in the comprehensive  Bougainville Peace Agreement of August 2001.



Securing Australia’s Interests 18

The Coalition Government will:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Maintain its efforts to help Papua New Guinea address its  long term development needs;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Work with the Papua New Guinea Government to  implement a comprehensive programme of law  enforcement and governance assistance; and

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Continue to play an active role in ensuring peace on  Bougainville.



With a shared history, unique inter-governmental structures and strong  people-to-people links, Australia and New Zealand have a special  relationship as allies and close economic partners.

While we remain two sovereign nations, the Closer Economic Relations  Agreement links our economies in a single market for mutual benefit.  The Coalition Government has worked to deepen this economic  relationship and believes Australia has a strong interest in a dynamic  relationship with an outward looking and economically strong New  Zealand.

The Coalition has initiated an Australia-New Zealand leadership forum,  bringing together key figures in both countries with the aim of building  stronger ties.

The Coalition Government will:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Pursue further economic integration with New Zealand  under the CER and explore other joint trade initiatives;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Encourage New Zealand to play an active defence role  within the region; and

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Continue to cooperate closely with New Zealand in the  South Pacific.





PART 5  RELATIONS WITH OTHER KEY REGIONS

(i)  Europe and the United Kingdom

Europe is undergoing great change.  Its recent expansion and new  constitution will have a significant impact on the international system.   The EU is Australia’s largest trading partner and our second largest  investment partner.







Securing Australia’s Interests 19

Individually the countries of Europe are important to Australia.  Our  bilateral ties are extensive, involving extensive economic engagement,  vital security cooperation and strong people-to-people links.

The Coalition has paid considerable attention to our relationship with  the United Kingdom, a relationship based on vibrant trade and  investment links, closely aligned security interests and shared values  and history.  The establishment of the Australia-UK Leadership  Dialogue in 2003 reflects this.

NATO is a crucial component of the security dynamic in Europe and is  increasingly involved in security efforts outside of Europe.  The  Coalition has therefore broadened Australia’s interaction with NATO.

A re-elected Coalition Government will:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Reaffirm the importance of Australia’s relationship with the  EU, recognising and making the most of our important  cultural, economic and strategic links;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢  Promote  a  regular dialogue with the EU President and the  Commission President, including at the leadership level;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Continue to work on a bilateral level with European  countries to deepen our economic and political linkages;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Further enhance the already strong relationship between  Australia and the United Kingdom, including our defence  and intelligence cooperation in the war against terrorism;  and

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Pursue closer links and cooperation with NATO.



(ii)  Middle East



The Coalition Government has strengthened Australia’s relationships  with the countries of the Middle East.  Trade and economic ties have  developed very well, reinforced by Australia’s commitment to the  region’s security through coalition action in Iraq and peace keeping  operations.  Community ties have grown stronger through the  Australian Government’s Council of Australian-Arab Relations.  The Coalition’s support for the Middle East peace process is steadfast.   We support Israel’s right to self-defence against terrorist attacks.  We  will continue to work towards a fairer and more responsible treatment  of the Middle East peace process in the UN and other multilateral  bodies.  The Coalition will continue to support the legitimate aspirations  of Palestinians for an independent homeland.







Securing Australia’s Interests 20

The Coalition Government was right to support a military response to  Saddam Hussein’s persistent defiance of mandatory UN Security  Council resolutions requiring him to disarm his WMD and related  capabilities.  All we have learnt since the war about Saddam’s WMD  ambitions shows that this was the only way to ensure his compliance.   And it has given Iraqis an historic opportunity to secure a prosperous  future, free from oppression, torture and murder.  Under the Coalition  Government, Australia will continue to support the Iraqi people.  The  Government commitment of Australian Defence Force personnel to  help train Iraq’s army is a clear demonstration that we will not abandon  the Iraqis to terrorists.

The Coalition Government will continue to promote Australian interests  in the Middle East by:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Supporting the Middle East peace process;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Maintaining support for Iraq’s transition to a democratic and  prosperous nation; and

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Promoting closer links with the Gulf States, through  economic engagement and the Council of Australian-Arab  Relations.





PART 6  GLOBAL CHALLENGES

(i)  Multilateralism and the United Nations

The Coalition Government is pragmatic in advancing Australia’s  interests in the world.  Multilateral organisations have been important to  our interests and Australia has made a significant contribution to their  effectiveness over many years.  However, not all multilateral  institutions are important to Australian interests and we must continue  to target our multilateral effort at those bodies most relevant to our  needs and objectives.

The United Nations is an important part of the machinery of global  cooperation.  The UN requires reform if it is to provide a multilateral  system that best serves the interests of its members, enabling them to  work in practical cooperation to meet contemporary challenges.   Australia has worked hard to improve the efficiency and effectiveness  of the United Nations.  We will continue this work.

Under the Coalition Government, Australia:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Led the UN operation to bring peace to East Timor;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Successfully gained UN General Assembly passage of the  Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) ;

Securing Australia’s Interests 21

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Proposed a comprehensive reform of the human rights  treaty bodies to make them more effective and better  focused;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Played a leading role in the development of the  International Criminal Court (ICC) statute; and

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Serves as the current Chair of the UN Commission on  Human Rights.



A re-elected Coalition Government will:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Support the UN Secretary-General’s efforts to reform the  UN;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Support reform of the Security Council so that it better  reflects contemporary international realities; and

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Promote reform of the antiquated UN electoral group  system.



(ii)  The Commonwealth



Spanning one third of the globe, the Commonwealth unites people of  different races, creeds and continents around a shared history and  common values.

The Coalition Government is committed to the Commonwealth, as  demonstrated by our very successful hosting of CHOGM in 2002.

The Coalition Government has used the Commonwealth to maximise  pressure on President Mugabe to stop grotesque abuses of the rule of  law and human rights in Zimbabwe.

The Coalition Government will:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Continue Australia’s engagement with the Commonwealth  to promote the principles of democracy, respect for the rule  of law and economic reform among member states.

(iii)  Human Rights



The Coalition has always believed that Australian foreign policy should  reflect the beliefs and values of the Australian community, and that  accordingly the promotion of human rights should form a fundamental  part of that policy.  The Coalition Government’s efforts to promote  human rights abroad have been practical and distinctive.  They have  focused on mechanisms and measures that can make a difference to  the lives of individuals.





Securing Australia’s Interests 22

The Australian Government holds regular senior-level discussions with  China on human rights issues and has provided significant technical  assistance.  We have established similar human rights dialogues with  Vietnam and Iran.

The Coalition Government was instrumental in the establishment of the  International Criminal Court, a body intended to bring to justice those  individuals guilty of crimes against humanity.  The Coalition  Government has also been instrumental in establishing and funding the  Asia-Pacific Forum for National Human Rights Institutions, as well as  the Centre for Democratic Institutions in Australia which assists  parliaments and judiciaries to function more effectively.  More  generally, the Coalition Government has ensured that good  governance and the rule of law are among the key objectives of  Australia’s aid programme.

The Coalition Government has demonstrated a willingness to intervene  throughout the region to protect human rights - in East Timor, in the  Solomon Islands and in Bougainville.  We supported the restoration of  democracy in Fiji following the coup of 2000.  We have contributed to  the toppling of two of the most odious and systematic abusers of  human rights of our age - Saddam Hussein in Iraq and the Taliban in  Afghanistan.  And we have used our influence in the Commonwealth to  pressure the Mugabe regime in Zimbabwe to respect basic human  rights.

Since being elected Chair of the Commission of Human Rights in  February 2003, Australia has sought to enhance the effectiveness of  multilateral action on human rights through reform of the human rights  treaty machinery.

A re-elected Coalition Government will:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Continue to take practical steps to encourage respect for  human rights throughout the region;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Use our position as Chair of the Commission of Human  Rights to improve the Commission’s effectiveness and to  promote further treaty body reform;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Expand our programme of bilateral human rights dialogues;  and

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Use Australia’s aid programme to promote human rights  and good governance throughout the region.













Securing Australia’s Interests 23

(iv)  Transnational Threats

Globalisation, with its vastly expanded flows of trade, finance and  people, has created more opportunities for transnational crime,  including the illegal movement of drugs, people and arms.  The scale of  these flows is immense.  It is estimated that four million people are  smuggled across borders each year, earning people smugglers  between $14 and $20 billion.

The Coalition Government has worked to combat these modern  criminal networks through greater international cooperation in law  enforcement, intelligence, and border and financial controls.

And the Coalition Government has shown that resolute action can yield  results.

The Coalition Government oversees one of the most generous  migration programmes in the world.  We are also among the most  generous nations to genuine refugees - we are the third largest  resettlement country of refugees worldwide.

The Coalition Government remains firmly of the view that Australia has  the right to control its own migration and refugee programmes.  It  should be Australians who decide who comes to Australia, not people  smugglers.  A re-elected Coalition Government will continue being  generous to those migrants and genuine refugees who make their  claims through the proper and regularized channels.  But we will  remain unashamedly tough on unauthorized arrivals and the people  smugglers who profit from them.

Deterrence works.  Excision, offshore processing, increased patrolling  of our maritime approaches and improved regional cooperation  arrangements have seen the number of unauthorized arrivals dry up.  The extradition, prosecution and sentencing of numerous high-profile

people-smugglers have sent a powerful signal to the industry.  Only  one boat of unauthorized arrivals has reached the Australian mainland  since the end of 2001.

The Coalition Government has moved to address other transnational  issues which threaten the security of nations, including in Australia’s  region.  These include environmental threats, communicable diseases,  the depletion of maritime resources and access to clean water.









Securing Australia’s Interests 24

The Coalition Government will:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Maintain its resolute attitude to border protection and  Australian sovereignty, including the rigorous patrolling of  our maritime approaches;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Retain the policies of excision, offshore processing and  mandatory detention that have acted as a powerful  deterrent to illegal migration;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Further improve regional cooperation arrangements to put  people-smugglers out of business; and

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Continue working cooperatively with countries in the region,  by sharing evidence and utilising extradition arrangements,  to bring transnational criminal networks to justice.



(v)  The Environment



The Coalition Government recognises the importance of the  environment including as a key determinant of quality of life. The  challenges posed by global warming and other environmental threats  demand a global response.  The Government is realistic enough to  realise that Kyoto, an agreement which excludes the US and other  major emitters such as developing countries, will not be effective in  reducing global greenhouse gas emissions.  The Coalition Government  looks beyond the Kyoto Protocol to a more comprehensive, effective  and long term response to climate change.  We will work actively in the  international community to develop such a response, ensuring that  such an agreement does not unfairly compromise the competitiveness  of Australian industry.

The Government recognises the importance of international co-operation in the sustainable management of resources and has been a  leading and active participant in international organisations concerned  with the protection of marine resources, including the Conservation of  Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) and the International  Whaling Commission (IWC).  Many of our aid projects in the region  promote the sustainable management of resources such as forestry  and fisheries.  We are an active player in the Convention on the  International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES).



PART 7  AUSTRALIAN AID: INVESTING IN GROWTH,  STABILITY AND PROSPERITY

Aid plays a crucial role in building a more secure and prosperous  region.  A source of support for developing countries, aid also serves  Australia’s national interest by helping create the conditions essential  for regional stability and growth.

Securing Australia’s Interests 25

In recent years the tragedy of the Bali bombings and the deterioration  of law and order in the Solomon Islands have demonstrated the  consequences of instability in undermining growth and hard won  development gains.

In September 2002 the Coalition Government released Australian Aid:  Investing in Growth, Stability and Prosperity.  This policy reaffirmed our  aid programme’s key objectives and its geographic focus on the Asia-Pacific region, while providing a new framework for aid delivery.

The Coalition Government is enhancing regional security by building  capacity in law enforcement agencies in the Asia-Pacific region and by  promoting growth and poverty reduction that, in turn, lessen the  potential for terrorist networks to develop.

Experience has shown that improving governance and strengthening  democratic process is essential to achieving better outcomes for  people in developing countries.

The Coalition Government is taking a more robust, ‘hands on’  approach in the Pacific through its successful assistance mission in the  Solomon Islands and its new enhanced cooperation with Papua New  Guinea aimed at improving law and order and good governance.

Openness to trade and investment flows and access to new  information and communication technologies are key factors in the long  term economic growth essential to poverty reduction.  Australia’s aid  programme recognises this reality and is assisting developing countries  to maximise the benefits of globalisation.

Australia has led the region in the fight against HIV-AIDS with a $600  million, ten year initiative to reduce HIV transmission and impacts, the  establishment of the Asia Pacific Leadership Forum on HIV-AIDS and  Development and participation in the Global Fund to Fight HIV,  Tuberculosis and Malaria.

Poverty reduction can be accelerated when people in developing  countries have the necessary tools to participate in growth.  The  Coalition Government continues to support improved access to quality,  affordable basic education, health care and water and sanitation  services.

Aid alone will never be the answer to the challenges confronting  developing countries.  But effectively targeted aid can act as a catalyst  for development and growth in the region.





Securing Australia’s Interests 26

A re-elected Coalition Government will:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Continue to focus Australia’s aid programme on poverty  reduction in the Asia Pacific region, with particular  emphasis on improved governance and the transfer of the  skills necessary for developing countries to participate in  the global economy; and

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Enhance regional security by investing in sound  development programmes that promote growth, stability  and prosperity.





PART 8  LOOKING AFTER AUSTRALIANS ABROAD

Since coming to office in 1996, the Coalition Government has made the  care and protection of Australians overseas a key priority for the  Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and its network of overseas  posts.  The Coalition has:

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Established a 24 hour Consular Operations Centre and  special Crisis Management and Contingency Planning  systems to deal with major consular emergencies;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Improved the access of Australians to passport services,  while strengthening the integrity of Australian passports  with new biometric security features;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Implemented tougher passport related legislation to provide  better security for all Australians;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Strengthened consular travel advice through strong  consultative processes involving Australia's intelligence  agencies;

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Encouraged greater awareness of travel advice through the  smartraveller website and the associated promotional  programme; and

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Placed touch-screen kiosks in a number of Australia’s  international airports to give travellers direct access to the  smartraveller website.

A re-elected Coalition Government will continue to regard the care and  protection of Australians overseas as a key priority of the Department  of Foreign Affairs and Trade and its overseas service.

LABOR’S ALTERNATIVE

DIMINISHING AUSTRALIA AND WEAK ON NATIONAL  SECURITY

(i)  Diminishing  Australia



The Labor Party acts and talks as though Australia were a small  country that has to beg to be accepted.

“Small countries are normally smarter than that.  Perhaps John Howard  doesn't think that we are.”  (Kevin Rudd, December 2002.)

The Labor Party wants to take us back in time, to Paul Keating’s  foreign policy when Australia was a supplicant in the region.  This not  only demeaned Australia, it reduced our significance in regional and  international affairs.

As part of its small country ethos Labor wants to pursue an isolationist  approach that will reduce Australia’s influence in the world without  protecting us from any terrorist threats.

(ii) Weak on the US Alliance



The Labor Party is ambivalent about the US alliance.  It professes  commitment, but its personal attacks on the US President, its  opposition to our troops’ efforts in Iraq and its stated doubts about  whether our role in Afghanistan made Australia an al-Qaeda target,  demonstrate a willingness to undermine this vital relationship for  domestic political gain.

Labor’s knee-jerk opposition to Missile Defence and its deep divisions  over a Free Trade Agreement with the US prove that, even while the  Labor leader wraps himself in the Stars and Stripes, his party’s  commitment to the relationship is dangerously ambivalent.

The profound anti-Americanism of many within the Labor Party fatally  compromises any undertakings the party might make with regard to  this vital alliance.  In the 21st century, confronted by the threat of  international terrorism, we cannot afford to offend and confuse our  most trusted friends and allies.  Now more than ever we need a firm  foreign policy articulated in clear and consistent language.

Securing Australia’s Interests 30

Similarly on the issue of Iraq, Labor has sent a series of confused and  conflicting messages to the world.  It sought to score political points at  home - even if it meant keeping Saddam Hussein in power.  This  would have left a brutal dictator, one who had used weapons of mass  destruction against his own people, in power in the Middle East.  In an  age of global terror, this was a risk we could not afford to take.

More recently, Labor has belittled the contribution made in Iraq by our  armed forces and has constantly changed its policy, leaving  Australians - and more scandalously Australian servicemen and  women - in doubt as to Australia’s role in Iraq should Labor win the  election given their commitment to cut and run.

Labor’s cut and run approach to our troops in Iraq will expose  Australians in Iraq, compromise the efforts of Australian businesses in  Iraq, and abandon the Iraqi people to terrorists and opponents of  democracy and freedom.

(iii) Weak on Counter-Proliferation of WMD

After promising before the last election to make non-proliferation a key  priority, Labor is yet to support the Proliferation Security Initiative or  suggest any alternative means of tackling a problem which they  described as “one of the most serious international security interests  facing the world” (24 October 2001).  Rather than seeking outcomes,  Labor seems to prefer empty symbolism and easy rhetoric.

Australia cannot afford Labor’s indecisiveness, or its fondness for  words and meaningless gestures.  Since 11 September 2001, the  international community has had to address the proliferation of WMD  and related technology, and the dangers posed by extremist terrorist  groups, with tough decisions and decisive action.

It appears the Labor Party would rather the UN craft our foreign policy  than Australians.  All too often Labor embraces multilateralist causes  without a hard-headed examination of whether or not these serve  Australia’s national interest.

(iv) Soft on People Smuggling

The Labor Party has been consistently soft on border protection.  It  wants people smugglers’ boats brought to Australia, rather than being  sent back to Indonesia.  Despite the excellent cooperative efforts of  Australia and Indonesia on the issue of people smuggling, and despite  Labor’s commitment to such cooperation before the last election,  Mark Latham is on record as attacking the Indonesian Government’s  approach to this issue.

The Coalition Government’s tough stance on excision and the Pacific  solution is working.  It has had a demonstrable deterrent effect on  would-be people smugglers.  Yet Labor calls it a disaster and wants to  replace it with an arrangement whereby a Coastguard greets  unauthorized vessels and escorts them to Australian territory and  Australia’s legal system.  Such a proposal would mark a return to the  past, to the days when people smuggling syndicates left vulnerable  people to die at sea and thousands tried to gain illegal entry to  Australia.

Deterring people smugglers ensures fewer lives are put at risk, that  genuine applicants who apply through the proper channels are  processed more quickly, and that our courts are not gridlocked with the  claims of those who are not genuine refugees.
