PRESS RELEASE, FROM TED INNES, MP, MEMBER FOR MELBOURNE.

The Australian Greek-Cypriot community had been insulted by the Australian

Government's war-mongering over Afghanistan, a Labor front-bencher said

today. .  .

The -Member for MelbourneÂ·, Mr Innes, said the Greek-Cypriot community had

approached the Foreign Minister, Mr Peacock, after Australia abstained on a

motion seeking settlement of theCyprus problem at the United Natidns in

November. .  Â·  .  .  Ã¢ÂÂ

"These people are disturbed that while Turkey still occupies 40 percent of

Cyprus, invaded in 1974, and 200,000 people, or one-third of the Greek-Cypriot

population, remain refugees, Australia has shown no concern for their.plight,"

he said. ,  .  Ã¢ÂÂ

"The Greek-Cypriot community sees the war-mongering over Afghanistan as

hypocrisy aimed at beating on Ã¢ÂÂ¢fha .commie-can in an election year.

"In a letter to me this week, the Justice for Cyprus Coordinating Committee

'During the past five years, the UNO has condemned the jiff-

invasion and voted in favour of as many resolutions about

Cyprus. Australia abstained in the 1979 general assembly

resolution.

Please have some understanding of the feelings and the

bitter disappointment of half a million Australians of

Greek origin.'  .  .

Mr Innes, the Australian delegate to the World Parliamentary conference bn

Cyprus, said Cyprus was one of several world trouble spots where Australian

conservative governments had remained silent during foreign invervention

and occupation. .

"It all leads us to question why- theyÂ· are. carrying on so histrionically1

about Afghanistan," h.e said. .  .

"I think the answer is clear. Firstly, it is an election year for Carter

and his messenger,  Fraser, and. a foreign issue to hide their overwhelming

economic and employment problems at ho.me is a desperate ruse to divert

the electorate. .  .

"Secondly, the left-wing Afghan government installed in 1978 has been

attempting meaningful social reforms. .

"The Australian government, and the US, want the nations in the oil gulf

area to remain in feudal ignorance so the western world can deal with placed,

regimes. .  ’  Ã¢ÂÂ   '

"We haven't heard Fraser shout hysterically about the US claim that the

Persian Gulf is its sphere of influence, or the US threat to overthrow the .

Jamaican Prime Minister, Mr Manley, unless he falls into line with US thinking.

"Yet surely that presumption to world control deserves our condemnation.

"One-third of the Greek-Cypriot, population remains in refugee camps or lives

and works in the Greek sector waiting for the day they can return to their

homes. Thousands more are missing. .

"Yet on this issue of human concern, the Australian government abstains at

the UN. .

"Any wonder the Greek-Cypriot community sees the Fraser-Peacock war—mongering

as electoral and ideological hypocrisy," Mr Innes said. .
