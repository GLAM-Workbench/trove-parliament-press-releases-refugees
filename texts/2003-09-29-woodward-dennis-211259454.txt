Dennis Woodward:  The Implementation of Fightback

Introduction

In the March 1993 federal election, John Hewson led the Liberal-National coalition to

defeat in what was termed for them the ‘unloseable election’1. Not only was the

Labor government presiding over the highest level of unemployment since the Great

Depression, but there had been growing disillusionment with the ALP amongst its

traditional supporters over its perceived abandonment of ‘Labor tradition’2, as

evidenced by the fact that its first preference vote had consistently fallen in every

election since it came to office in 1983 - culminating in its narrow victory in the 1990

federal election despite it failure to win a majority of the ‘two party preferred’ vote3.

In addition, since that election its popular leader (and prime minister), Bob Hawke

had been replaced by the less popular former treasurer, Paul Keating. Yet the ALP

was returned with an increased share of the vote.

This defeat for the coalition was sheeted home to its detailed policy program,

Fightback!, that had been released well before the election. In particular, the

unpopularity of its proposed Goods and Services Tax (GST) was generally seen as

the main reason for its defeat, although more detailed studies showed that its

proposed industrial relations and health policies were also significant vote losers4. In

the wake of this loss, Hewson (before he was replaced as leader of the Liberal party)

declared that Fightback! was ‘dead’. Similarly, when Howard regained the leadership

of the Liberal party, he was keen to distance himself from this electoral albatross and

gave the Australian public the reassurance that there would ‘never, ever’ be a GST.

A decade has elapsed since Fightback! was so resoundingly rejected by Australian

voters, yet in that time a number of its policies have been implemented by the

Howard governments. It is opportune, therefore, to re-examine Fightback! to see

which of its policies have been put into practice. This paper seeks to do this and to

explore how Howard has managed to succeed with what were considered

discredited policies. It also poses the question to what extent can Fightback! be seen as

providing a policy guide for the Howard governments.

GST

Dennis Woodward:  The Implementation of Fightback

There are significant similarities between the taxation proposals in Fightback! and the

changes to the taxation system that have been implemented under the Howard

governments. The centrepiece of Fightback! was undoubtedly the proposed change to

taxation built around the introduction of a GST. This tax on all goods and services

(except for some specific items that would be zero-rated or exempt) was to have been

set at the rate of 15 per cent.5 Its introduction was to have paved the way for the

abolition of seven taxes - wholesale sales tax; payroll tax; petroleum products excise;

superannuation lump sum tax; customs duties (to be phased out by 2000); training

guarantee levy; and the coal export duty6 - although not all the taxes to be abolished

lay within federal jurisdiction.

The new tax mix proposed in Fightback! boasted the ‘largest tax cuts in Australian

history’. In particular, personal income tax rates were to be ‘slashed’ such that 95% of

taxpayers would face a marginal tax rate of 30 per cent or less and taxpayers would

be able to earn $75,000 per year and only have to pay a marginal tax rate that would

be lower than they currently paid if earning above $20,700.7 Significant cuts were also

promised in both capital gains tax and fringe benefits tax.8 In addition, a tax free

savings scheme was proposed; the corporate tax rate was to have been increased to

42 cents in the dollar9; the automatic indexation of excises was promised10 (as was the

abolition of all fuel excise)11; and the return of revenue to taxpayers from tax bracket

creep was to have been guaranteed.12 Lastly, a new approach to Commonwealth-State financial relations in terms of revenue sharing was foreshadowed.13 Together, it

was argued, these changes would :

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Reform and simplify Australia’s grossly inefficient taxation system

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Boost our national productivity and savings

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Enable greater international competitiveness by slashing taxes on business inputs

and exports

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Assist in reducing marginal tax rates and thus increase incentives to work, save

and invest

Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Make the tax system fairer by reducing avoidance and evasion.14

While the Howard governments have not exactly replicated the tax proposals of

Fightback!, they have put in place a number of changes to the tax system that can

trace their paternity back to that document. Most obviously, the introduction of a

GST marks the achievement of the central core of the Fightback! program. The

Dennis Woodward:  The Implementation of Fightback

Business Council of Australia and its role in the Business Coalition on Tax Reform

was important in keeping tax reform on the political agenda and having the coalition

government adopt the tax package as the key plank in its re-election platform15.

Important also, was the neutralising of opposition to the proposed tax changes from

the welfare lobby. The Australian Council of Social Service, for example, gave

qualified support to the GST as it was seen as a way of raising revenue needed for

welfare services16.

Having unveiled the GST plan on 13 August 1998, the government embarked on an

intensive advertising campaign to ‘sell’ the proposals. It then called a ‘snap’ election

on 30 August in which taxation reform was the major issue.17 The coalition passed

the first hurdle in implementing its tax package by narrowly winning the election -

interestingly gaining a marginal advantage as a result of its tax reforms18. In

explaining this result, as well as the support of the business community and the

quieting of the welfare lobby (already mentioned), the government were able to

appease the state premiers by promising that all the revenue raised by the GST

would flow to the states. In addition, it appears that the government succeeded in

convincing the electorate that the tax system was ‘broken’ and in need of reform; that

the income tax cuts would make middle income Australians ‘better off’19; that the

reforms would reduce tax avoidance; and that those disadvantaged by the changes

would be adequately compensated20.  The fate of Fightback! was also clearly in the

minds of coalition strategists who made sure that this time around their tax

proposals would not be released well in advance of an election, thus limiting the time

available for the opposition (and other interest groups) to find fault with the

package.

Despite winning the election, however, the government still did not command a

Senate majority and needed to win the support of independents or the Australian

Democrats in order to implement the GST. After Senator Harradine had refused to

support the GST, the government were forced to negotiate with the Australian

Democrats who were then led by Meg Lees. Lees (and Democrat economics

spokesman, Andrew Murray) agreed to support the GST provided that some

concessions - most notably that the GST be excluded from fresh food and that the tax

cuts to high income earners be reduced - were made by the government.21 The

government readily accepted these terms and the legislation was eventually passed

Dennis Woodward:  The Implementation of Fightback

despite the fact that some Democrats, such as Natasha Stott Despoja refused to

support the legislation.22

The GST implemented by Howard had a rate of 10 per cent while that proposed in

Fightback! had been set at 15 per cent and the income tax cuts were correspondingly

less. The exemptions, most notably on fresh food, that were accepted by Howard

were not too dissimilar from the exemptions that Hewson was persuaded to

introduce to his original tax package.23 The decision to give all the revenue raised

through the GST to the states, fulfilled another Fightback! promise to introduce a new

approach to Commonwealth-State financial relations in terms of revenue sharing.

Other tax proposals in Fightback! have been variously followed or contradicted under

Howard. The promise of significant cuts in capital gains tax was achieved by

Howard cutting capital gains tax in half!24 To date, however, there has been no

attempt to reduce the fringe benefits tax. The tax free savings scheme of Fightback!

has not been pursued by Howard and, rather than increase the corporate tax rate to

42 cents in the dollar, Howard has reduced it from 36 to 34 per cent for 2000-1 and

thereafter to 30 per cent.25 The automatic indexation of excises outlined in Fightback!

was actually implemented under the ALP government and continued under Howard

(except for fuel excise which was no longer to be automatically indexed after 2001). If

Fightback! suggested some form of tax indexation when it promised to guarantee the

return of revenue to taxpayers from tax bracket creep, then this is a promise that has

not been followed by the Howard governments. If, however, this promise could be

interpreted as the periodic granting of income tax cuts financed by returning some of

the revenue gained through bracket creep, then Howard has remained faithful to this

aspect of Fightback as well.26

Lastly, it is worthy of note that the promised benefits from the Fightback! tax package

(and that of Howard) have not fully materialised. The taxation system has not been

simplified; national savings have fallen, not increased; Australia’s international

competitiveness does not appear to have markedly improved; and tax avoidance and

evasion have not been reduced but have actually increased.27 Tax revenue has

increased to the highest level in Australian history,28 yet it is doubtful that the

welfare lobby have benefited from it.

Dennis Woodward:  The Implementation of Fightback

Industrial Relations

Fightback! foreshadowed changes to the industrial relations system that were made or

attempted by the Howard governments. Fightback! indicated that ‘labour market

reform’ would return negotiations over wages and conditions to the workplace and

that this would make enterprises both more productive and more rewarding.29 That

is, it outlined an emphasis on enterprise bargaining and (by implication) a lessened

role for the Australian Industrial Relations Commission (AIRC). The notion that

these changes were in some way a ‘return’ is rather a strange view since the

proposed system had not been a feature of industrial relations since federation.

Interestingly, under the heading of ‘infrastructure reform’, Fightback! promised to:

…end the Waterside Workers’ Federation monopoly on the waterfront, introduce enterprise agreements that will give stevedoring companies the right to recruit and manage their own workforce, privatise port authorities and promote competition between ports.30

The blueprint for the waterfront dispute had been outlined.

There is no doubt that the Howard governments attempted to implement the

industrial relations policies outlined in Fightback!. In May 1996 it introduced the

Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill, the thrust of which was to

reduce the power of trade unions and to marginalise the Australian Industrial

Relations Commission. Key features of the bill included encouragement of individual

contracts between workers and their employers (Australian Workplace Agreements)

without union intervention; the outlawing of strikes and ‘strike pay’ once enterprise

agreements had been signed; a relaxation of the unfair dismissal laws; the restriction

of awards to 18 core minimum conditions; the phasing out of paid rates awards;

provision for enterprise based unions with a minimum number of 20 workers;

restrictions on union officials gaining access to work sites; limiting the role of the

AIRC to maintaining minimum award conditions, dealing with federal unfair

dismissal claims and intra-union disputes; the banning of secondary boycotts; the

lifting of limits on hours to be worked by part-time workers; and removal of

payment for work-related training.31

Dennis Woodward:  The Implementation of Fightback

The lack of a Senate majority, however, meant that the Howard government had to

win the support of independents or the Australian Democrats in order to have the

legislation passed. The legislation was eventually passed with the support of the

Australian Democrats but only after 170 amendments were accepted. These

amendments had the effect of considerably softening the harsher aspects of the

proposed legislation.32

The most spectacular attempt to implement an aspect of industrial relations policy

foreshadowed in Fightback! was the ‘waterfront dispute’ that erupted in April 1998.

In essence this involved a deliberate policy to train non-union waterfront workers, to

dismiss the existing unionised waterside workers (members of the Maritime Union of

Australia) and lock them out and to replace them with the non-union workforce.

Despite a personal meeting between Prime Minister Howard and the head of P&O in

London,33 P&O decided not to take part in the operation and the lock out occurred

only on those docks controlled by Patrick Stevedores. Those docks were largely

successfully picketed (with a surprising degree of public sympathy) while the

dispute was played out in the courts. The courts finally ruled in favour of the

dismissed unionists who were reinstated. Ironically it was a clause in the Howard

government’s own legislation preventing discrimination against workers on the basis

of their non union or union membership, which proved crucial.34

A ‘second wave’ of industrial reforms was attempted during the second Howard

government. The cutely named, Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (More Jobs

Better Pay) Bill, was introduced to parliament in late June 1999. Its thrust can be seen

as a further attempt to weaken the position of unions and to further reduce the

conditions covered by awards. Unions would be required to hold secret ballots

before taking strike action and the AIRC would be required to make orders against

illegal strikes within 48 hours of being notified. The AIRC (to be renamed the

Australian Workplace Relations Commission) was to have its powers over

compulsory conciliation reduced and the lifetime tenure of its commissions reduced

to seven years.35 Unfortunately for the Howard government, it was unable to secure

sufficient Senate support to have this legislation passed. Fightback! type industrial

relations policies have not, however, been abandoned by the Howard government as

is shown by its repeated attempts to introduce AWAs and restrict industrial action in

Dennis Woodward:  The Implementation of Fightback

the tertiary education sector by linking funding to acceptance of the government’s

Workplace Reform Program.36

Health

Health is another policy area in which some of the actions of the Howard

governments can be traced to Fightback!. For example, while Fightback! sought to

reassure voters that Medicare would be retained (and improved) as a system of

universal health cover, it also proclaimed that the ‘balance’ between the public and

private sectors would be ‘restored’. This was to be achieved by encouraging

individuals to ‘provide for their own health care by taking out private health

insurance’.37 This ‘encouragement’ was to take a ‘carrot and stick’ approach. A new

private health insurance tax credit system was to be introduced for low and middle

income earners and the elderly, while high income earners who failed to take out

private health insurance would be subjected to a ‘new surcharge’.38

Fightback! also promised that bulk billing would be retained but that it would no

longer be universal. Pensioners, health card holders and the disabled would still be

able to access bulk billing but it would no longer be available for ‘other

Australians’.39 In other words, bulk billing would be restricted to a narrowly targeted

group of welfare beneficiaries. In addition, it was proposed that the government

monopoly on medical insurance would be abolished and that ‘gap insurance’ (to

cover the gap between what Medicare would pay for various procedures and what

private practioners might charge for those procedures) would be allowed.40

Increasingly, it appears as though Fightback! has provided an exact blueprint for the

health policies that would be put in place by the Howard governments. Individuals

have been encouraged to take out private health insurance using the ‘carrot and

stick’ approach. In the 1997 budget a one per cent Medicare surcharge was

introduced for high income earners who failed to take out private health insurance

and in 1998 a 30 per cent rebate on private health insurance was introduced.41 In

addition, in June 2000 the government introduced the ‘lifetime health cover’ to

encourage young people to take out private health insurance by increasing

premiums for people who delayed joining a fund until after they had turned 30.42

These measures had the effect of boosting health fund membership from 31 per cent

Dennis Woodward:  The Implementation of Fightback

of the population to a peak of almost 46 per cent in 2000, but there has been a

subsequent fall in coverage to 43 per cent in 2003.43

As promised in Fightback!, ‘gap insurance’ was allowed. Cabinet approval of this

decision was announced in a press release by then health minister, Michael

Wooldridge on 14 December 1999.44 Lastly, it seems that ‘bulk billing’ by general

practioners (that has declined by 11 per cent since the Howard government first

came to office) is liable to be restricted only to pensioners and health card holders (as

envisioned in Fightback!) as a result of the Howard government’s plans to only offer

incentive payments to doctors who bulk bill such people.45

Dennis Woodward:  The Implementation of Fightback

Privatisation

A major program of privatisation was outlined in Fightback!. Those Commonwealth

authorities that undertook business functions were to be privatised and certain

government services were to be ‘contracted out’.46 Government business enterprises

that were specifically named as privatisation targets were Qantas; the

Commonwealth Bank; the Australian Mining Industry Development Corporation,

the Australian National Line; the Pipeline Authority; the Commonwealth Serum

Laboratories; the Australian and Overseas Telecommunications Corporation; the

Federal Airports Corporation; and Medibank Private. In addition, it was stated that

the privatisation of Telecom would be commenced.47

The Howard governments have pursued privatisation and ‘contracting out’ with

zeal.48 Ironically, however, many of the privatisation targets specifically outlined in

Fightback! were actually privatised by the previous Labor government. Thus

Australian Airlines was merged with Qantas and privatised under Labor; the

Commonwealth Bank was fully privatised in a series of public floats; the Australian

Overseas Telecommunications Corporation (OTC) was merged with Telecom to

become the government business enterprise, Telstra; Aussat was sold to a Telstra

competitor, Optus; and the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories was privatised in

1994.49

Those government enterprises not privatised under Labor have generally been

privatised under the Howard governments. The Australian National Line was sold

by the Howard government;50 the Australian Pipeline Authority was similarly sold

(to Agility Management)51 and the airports were also privatised. The biggest

privatisation under the Howard governments, however, has been the part

privatisation of Telstra. This has already fulfilled the promise in Fightback! that the

privatisation of Telecom would be ‘commenced’ (and in passing also virtually

achieved the privatisation of OTC). The full privatisation of Telstra, however, has yet

to be achieved. This has been the result of both the difficulty of getting sufficient

support in the Senate to pass the necessary legislation and the need to persuade the

Liberal party’s coalition partner, the National party, that the full privatisation of

Telstra would not reduce telecommunications services in the rural areas. Initially,

one third of Telstra was privatised (through a public float) in 1977 and an additional

Dennis Woodward:  The Implementation of Fightback

16 per cent was sold (again by public float) in October 1999 - leaving 51 per cent still

in government ownership. While Howard had hoped to sell all of the remaining

government share of Telstra in the second tranche, he was forced to limit the sale to

16 per cent to maintain coalition harmony.52 Similarly, during the 2001 federal

election campaign, Howard again reassured rural voters that the rest of Telstra

would not be sold during his next term of office.53 While the government has since

shown that it is keen to privatise the remainder of Telstra by passing legislation to

that effect through the lower house in August 200354, it has thus far been unable to

gain Senate support for the proposal. Even without the full privatisation of Telstra,

however, most of the privatisation goals set out in Fightback! have been achieved.

Regulatory Change

Given the overall ‘neo-liberal’/’economic rationalist’ thrust of Fightback!, it is not

surprisingly to note that it advocated a degree of deregulation. It, for example,

indicated that the telecommunications market would be opened to full competition

and that the Australian monopoly on coastal shipping and the Trans-Tasman

Shipping Agreement would be ended.55 Less expected, however, was its advocacy of

the strengthening of prudential regulation. The promise to ‘establish an effective

system of prudential supervision’ was, however, not depicted as re-regulation but

rather as something necessary to underwrite confidence in the financial system and

to ‘send clear messages to investors about the relative performance of different

institutions’.56

The deregulatory thrust of Fightback! was certainly pursued under the Howard

governments. The telecommunications market has been opened to full competition

(although this process started under the previous ALP governments); the Australian

monopoly on coastal shipping was ended; and Trans-Tasman shipping was

deregulated - resulting in foreign crewed vessels replacing Australian and New

Zealand crews according to the Maritime Union of Australia.57

The promise to strengthen prudential regulation made in Fightback! was honoured by

the Howard government. An inquiry was established chaired by Stan Wallis (the

Wallis Inquiry) in 1996 and it reported in April 1997. Its recommendations regarding

reducing the number of financial regulatory bodies to three and having them take

Dennis Woodward:  The Implementation of Fightback

charge by type of activity rather than type of institution58 was acted upon by the

government. Thus, the Reserve Bank remained responsible for bank regulation

(monetary policy, the payments system and system stability); a new body, the

Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, was given the task of regulating deposit

taking, life and general insurance and superannuation; and the Australian Securities

and Investments Commission was to oversee consumer protection, market integrity

and corporations.59 (The new prudential regulatory bodies did not, however, prevent

some spectacular corporate collapses - for example, HIH insurance and Ansett

Airlines).

The Family

Commitments to ‘the family’are characteristic of conservative parties and the Liberal

and National parties are no exception to this broad generalisation. They have been a

feature of the Howard governments and they were also included in the Fightback!

program. For example, it offered a ‘family assistance package’ that entailed a

doubling of family allowances to eligible families and ‘significant’ increases for many

others. The Dependent Spouse Rebate for families with children was to be increased

for families with incomes of up to $75,000 and there was to be an increase in the

Family Assistance Supplement.60 In addition, to help those seeking to begin a family,

there was to be a new First Home Owners Scheme.61

Family assistance under the Howard governments has tended to be in the form of the

family tax initiative that was part of the tax package associated with the introduction

of the GST. Single income families with children under five were especially targeted

in this initiative.62 In July 2000 family assistance was streamlined with further

changes to both the tax and family benefit systems. Instead of the previous twelve

types of assistance to families, there became three. Tax rebates such as the dependent

spouse rebate, sole parent rebate and cash allowances such as the family allowance

and basic parenting payment were replaced by the Family Tax Benefit parts A and B.

In addition, there was to be a single Childcare Benefit. The Family Tax Benefit Part A

was available for all families with incomes up to $73,000 while Part B was a universal

payment for one-income families. Lastly, a National Families Strategy was

launched.63 These policies were certainly in line with the thrust of Fightback!.

Dennis Woodward:  The Implementation of Fightback

The introduction of a grant for first home owners was another policy that fulfilled a

Fightback! promise. The Howard government introduced the First Home Owners’

Scheme on 1 July 2000 to compensate first home buyers for the increased costs

resulting from the introduction of the GST. It was set at $7,000 and could be used to

purchase either a new or existing dwelling. This was increased to $14,000 from 9

March 2001 (with a deadline of 1 December 2001 for signing a contract) for those

buying a new dwelling.64 This latter change was designed to provide a stimulus to

the housing industry (and the economy) which had slumped as a result of the

introduction of the GST and a cynic might suggest that its time span was designed to

see the government through the next election. Regardless, it represented a happy

marriage of pragmatic politics and the policy predilections of Fightback!.

Education

With respect to education, it is interesting to note that Fightback! had commitments to

encourage ‘parent choice of school’ in the government sector and also to spend $567

million on capital improvement in the non-government schools.65

If anything, the Howard governments have exceeded the commitments to non-government schools outlined in Fightback!. There has been a massive shift in federal

funding in favour of the private school sector, such that under the States Grants Act

government school students (who constitute 70% of Australian children) receive only

32% of federal schools funding.66

Dennis Woodward:  The Implementation of Fightback

Electricity Reform

As part of its thrust to ‘modernise our basic infrastructure’, Fightback! promised that a

coalition government would ‘negotiate with the states to establish full inter-state

trade in electricity through the establishment of a national power grid.67

Serious moves in this direction had began in 1990 at Special Premiers Conferences

held under the auspices of the Labor government. In July 1991 a National Grid

Management Council (NGMC) was established with a target date for the new

‘national grid’ being set for mid-1993. Delays in the process saw the defeat of the

Labor government in 1996 still without a national electricity market or national grid

in place. The National Electricity Market finally began in mid-1998 under the

Howard government (although it was not truly national - incorporating only the

eastern mainland states and the ACT).68 In this case, once again a Howard

government had brought to fruition a Fightback! promise, although the groundwork

and most of the ‘running’ had been achieved under the previous Labor governments.

Immigration

In view of the stance that Howard was to take against ‘asylum seekers’ and the

centrality of the immigration issue in the rise of Pauline Hanson’s One Nation party,

it is instructive to note that it did not feature prominently in the Fightback! program.

It did, however, state that a ‘more realistic’ immigration program would be

implemented.69 What this meant was that ‘in the short-term’ there would be a

substantial reduction in the immigration intake to a level ‘significantly below the

government’s current projections’.70

In actual fact, immigration has not been reduced under the Howard governments but

rather it has been increased. In all probability, the public perception is liable to be

that Howard has reduced immigration levels. That perception can be seen as being

fostered by Howard’s slowness to condemn Pauline Hanson’s comments on the

threat posed by Asian immigration - not to mention Howard’s own utterances

during the ‘Asian immigration’ debate of the 1980s triggered by Geoffrey Blainey; his

firm action in preventing asylum seekers aboard the Tampa from landing on

Australian soil; and also his statements to the effect that we don’t want ‘these people’

(people who throw their children overboard) when discussing the issue of boat

Dennis Woodward:  The Implementation of Fightback

people during the 2001 federal election. Yet, net migration has been trending upward

since the first year of the Howard government, reaching a peak of 136,000 in 2000-1

and remained at about that level (134,000) in the following year.71 Moreover, the

planned migrant intake has expected further increases each year and this trend is

continuing.72 What has changed is the mix of categories in the migrant intake with a

relative reduction in the ‘family reunion’ category and a corresponding increase in

the ‘skilled migrant’ category.73 If this shift represents a ‘more realistic’ immigration

program, then Howard has again followed the precepts of Fightback! but the increase

in the migrant intake seems to be a departure from it.

Foreign Policy and Security

Again, in the light of subsequent events, it is ironic to see how little prominence

foreign policy and security issues were given in Fightback!. Less than a page was

devoted to this policy area. But even here there were indications of the direction that

a future Howard government was to take. In particular, it was stated that:

A Hewson Government will ensure our national security through more effective

regional diplomacy by strengthening our alliance relationships (particularly with the

United States) and enhancing the capabilities of our own Defence Force.74 (emphasis

added)

To suggest that the Howard governments have pursued this strategy outlined in

Fightback! is in understatement. Almost from the outset Howard sought to distance

himself from Australia’s engagement with Asia and move ever closer to the United

States - even to the extent of being happy to accept the tag of ‘deputy sheriff in what

has been called the ‘Howard Doctrine’.75 Subsequent commitments of Australian

troops to operate alongside US forces in Afghanistan and as part of the ‘coalition of

the willing’ in Iraq were indicative of the importance that the Howard government

has placed on this alliance. Increased spending on defence has also mirrored that

suggested in Fightback!76

Conclusion

Circumstances have changed considerably in the decade since Fightback! was so

strongly rejected by Australian voters and it would be foolish to think that its policies

Dennis Woodward:  The Implementation of Fightback

would have maintained their relevance. Yet, an examination of not only the more

central aspects of Fightback! but also of many of its lesser known commitments,

reveals that a surprising number of them have been implemented by the Howard

governments. This need not necessarily mean that Howard came to office with a

detailed blueprint that he has been consistently trying to implement, although the

correspondence of some policies with those outlined in Fightback! suggests that it was

the inspiration for at least them. Rather, it seems that Fightback! encapsulated the

policy leanings (or predilections) that had taken hold of the Liberal party by the

1990s with the dominance of its ‘dries’ and these economic rationalist/neo-liberal

economic and social policies remained dominant. It is almost as though they were

the ‘default settings’ that resurface in response to various policy problems.

Perhaps a more interesting question is how Howard has managed to be twice re-elected despite pursuing a policy program that was so recently seen as electoral

poison. Has the Australian electorate changed so dramatically in only a decade? Or

does the explanation lie in the failings of the ALP to enunciate an alternative

program? But that is a subject beyond the scope of this paper.
