M A C K E L L A R M .P .5 April 1977 IEA 21/77MINISTER REFUTES MIGRANT UNEMPLOYMENT CLAIMMigrant unemployment had not "doubled" as reportedly claimed by the :  Leader of the Opposition, Mr Whitlam, the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, the Hon. M.J.R.MacKellar, said today. '"In fact, between November 1975 and November 1976 there was a drop from 70,000 to 69,700 in the number of overseas-born unemployed," Mr MacKellar said."The most recent labour-force data show that from November 1974 to NovÂ­ember 1976 the total number of overseas-born people out of work rose from 64,200 to 69,700. The figure for 1975 was 70,000. ."This is a long way short of 'a doubling1  in migrant unemployment as Mr Whitlam claimed."In this two-year period there was an increase of 8.6 per cent in overseas- born unemployed, whereas unemployment generally in the Australian labour force rose by 26.5 per cent."Mr MacKellar said it was important to remember that migrants, particularly in the first few months of arrival, could face problems of readjustment to different working conditions. As well, they could face a range of other difficulties which could hinder their employment prospects."However, as the figures I've quoted indicate, the employment record of the migrant component of Australia's labour force reflects high credit upon their adaptability and industry," Mr MacKellar said."This record is more meritorious than disclsoed by the figures because a substantial proportion of Australia's recent migrants were not admitted because their qualifications or skills were in demand. ."Many of them have been refugees, evacuees, dependant relatives or others admitted for humanitarian and compassionate reasons."
