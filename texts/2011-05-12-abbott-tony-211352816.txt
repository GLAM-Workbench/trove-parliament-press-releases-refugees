TRANSCRIPT OF THE HON. TONY ABBOTT MHR,  INTERVIEW WITH PAUL JAMES,  RADIO 4KZ, FAR NORTH QUEENSLAND

E&OE……………………….…………………………………………………………………

PAUL JAMES:

Good morning, Tony.

TONY ABBOTT:

G’day Paul. How are you?

PAUL JAMES:

Good, thank you. A couple of things though we need run by you this morning. The Federal Budget last  Tuesday night, it’s been described by some people as, well, someone said ‘same garbage different flies.’

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, I don’t want to encourage anyone to be rude about the Federal Government but it was a bit of a  nothing Budget because its badge of economic virtue - a surplus in 2012-13 - is not going to be achieved by  economic reform it’s going to be achieved by heroic assumptions about the terms of trade and economic  growth and we all know that this Government’s record is much better at predicting a surplus than actually  delivering one, and if we do get this surplus it’ll be a surplus made in China, it won’t be a surplus made in  Australia.

PAUL JAMES:

So what does that mean, we’re spending more than what we’re getting?

TONY ABBOTT:

It does, Paul. What it means is that right now we’re borrowing about $135 million a day and that’s to keep  the spending spree going. The deficit this year is going to be the second highest in our history at $50 billion.  Last year was the highest in our history at about $57 billion and this is a Government which is still drowning

in debt and, as I said, if they do get to a surplus in two years time it’ll be all thanks to the hard work of  China, it won’t be thanks to any hard work that this Government has done in Canberra.

PAUL JAMES:

Tony, they’re pretty big numbers, borrowing $135 million every day and paying $18 million in interest to  fund the Budget. They’re pretty big numbers and it just seems like it’s going to be hard to recover from.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, that’s right, Paul, and you know in this Budget they weren’t tough on waste but they were tough on  families. Now, you know, I don’t want to say that these are swingeing cuts on families but certainly there’s  $2 billion that they’re cutting from family assistance and at the same time you’ve got a $1.7 billion blowout  in border protection costs. So, this is a Government which is hitting families to pay for its own incompetence  when it comes to its failure to stop the boats. So, I think people are understandably irritated and sometimes  even embarrassed by this Government.

PAUL JAMES:

$292 million to Malaysia for our illegal immigrants. Why so much?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, because the Government hasn’t been able to stop the boats. As you know, Paul, John Howard found a  problem and he created a solution. The current Government - starting with Mr Rudd and continuing with Ms  Gillard - they found a solution and they created a problem. Since the current Government watered down the  situation that was working we’ve had more than 220 illegal boats and we’ve had more than 11,000 illegal  arrivals. We’ve currently got some 6,500 people in detention right around Australia and the Government’s  latest desperate bid to stop this is to say ‘well, we’ll send 800 to Malaysia and the Malaysians will give us  4,000 of theirs.’ Well, some negotiator the Prime Minister has turned out to be.

PAUL JAMES:

It doesn’t sound like it’s a good deal.

TONY ABBOTT:

No, it’s a terrible deal for Australia. It might be a good deal for Malaysia but it’s a terrible deal for Australia  and what it basically means is that Malaysia will become the back door route to Australia.

PAUL JAMES:

Are they giving any guarantees as to what they’re going to do with these people or are they just going to  throw them on their streets and let the same thing just happen all over again?

TONY ABBOTT:

It’s very hard to say because the Prime Minister has announced something without actually having any of  the details worked out. One of the things that has emerged in the last couple of days is that the Malaysian  Government will want to pick the people that it chooses from Australia and that basically means that they’ll  be in detention in Australia anyway, and in the time when they’re in detention in Australia, no doubt many  of them will be given permanent residency. So, this is another half-baked, panicky announcement that’s  unravelling before it’s been put in place.

PAUL JAMES:

Tony, have to ask you about the agriculture sector. They’ve sliced another $32.8 million from the Budget  leaving only a shell of the original amount. The farm sector drives $155 billion a year in economic  production. Have they made the right move there?

TONY ABBOTT:

I don’t believe so. Look, I know governments have got to be prudent but this Government should stop  spending on things that we don’t really need like the $50 billion-plus National Broadband Network so that  we don’t have to do things like cut into agriculture and water down our quarantine service and so on. I mean,  they’ve cut tens of millions of dollars out of quarantine services since 2007 and that can’t be good for  Australia’s biosecurity.

PAUL JAMES:

Tony, federal member Bob Katter has applauded Wayne Swan for listening to the voice of regional  Australia. He said it’s probably one of the better budgets for regional Australia.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well look, I can understand Bob wanting to see more spending in his part of the world and who doesn’t  want to see more spending in their part of the world? But in the end the test of a budget is not just whether it  doles out a little bit of money for a local area but whether it’s good for the national economy and the  difficulty with this Budget is that there isn’t any real reform in there. There’s no sign that this Government  understands that unless private businesses are doing well, unless we can get interest rates down rather than  have them going up, it’s going to be bad for the national economy and so while I can understand Bob’s  enthusiasm for some of the things that the Budget announces I think it’s important to temper that with an  appreciation that you just can’t trust these guys with money.

PAUL JAMES:

Yeah, there’s been varying reports on that. What, a couple of months ago I think Simon Crean promised a  billion dollars for Regional Development Australia and that’s in the Budget it’s delivered just $150 million.  So that’s a big difference, isn’t it?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, that’s right, Paul, and you know so much of what this Government does turns out to be not what it  seems. For instance, they said that they were giving $1.5 billion more to mental health. Well, I think they  should be spending more money on mental health and I’m happy that the Coalition’s mental health  announcement a while back helped to shame them into that. But when you actually look behind the figures,  they’re cutting about half a billion dollars out of existing mental health spending through Medicare-funded  consultations for psychologists. So, what this Government tends to give with one hand it takes with the other  hand.

PAUL JAMES:

It’s a little bit like the carbon tax isn’t it - giving with one, taking with the other?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well that’s right, Paul. I mean, you know the Prime Minister says it’s a Labor Budget and wants to look  after families but whatever it’s doing in the Budget it’s undoing with the great big new carbon tax which is

coming in and as we know the carbon tax will add 25 per cent to your power bill and six and a half cents a  litre to your petrol bill and that’s just for starters.

PAUL JAMES:

$14 million carbon tax education campaign for something that, well, looks like its going to…is it going to  happen?

TONY ABBOTT:

That’s a very, very good question. I certainly hope that the independent members of parliament will be  listening to their electorates. I get the impression that Bob Katter the local member for Kennedy is  determined to oppose the carbon tax, but I’m not so sure about Tony Windsor and Rob Oakeshott. Andrew  Wilkie is an unknown quantity here. So look, I’ll be doing my best to talk to local independent members but  I hope their electorates are talking to them as well.

PAUL JAMES:

Well, I guess if it doesn’t go ahead, they’re risking $14 million on the carbon tax education campaign for  something that mightn’t happen.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I’m sure they will find something else to spend the money on; they’re very good at spending money  on advertising campaigns this Government. But look, it would be a disaster for Australia if this carbon tax  goes ahead. Not only would it hurt everyone’s cost of living, but it would send jobs offshore to the industries  overseas which don’t have the same kind of cost disadvantages that a carbon tax would put on our  industries.

PAUL JAMES:

Now, you’ve got your second response to the federal Budget tonight. You are talking about cutting, the idea  of cutting, what, about 12,000 public services jobs to pay down the government debt?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, that’s one of the things that we took to the election and certainly you can save quite a few billions of  dollars over the forward estimates period if you have a slimmer public service and certainly there are about  24,000 extra Commonwealth employees now than there were in 2007 and I don’t think that you can say that  there’s been that much better service from Canberra in the last three years. So, I think the public service  could be a little slimmer. I am not talking about sacking anyone, but I think you could slim it down. But  look, that’s not going to be the focus of the Budget reply. The focus of the Budget reply is going to be an  alternative vision. I think the Australian people need to know that government doesn’t have to be as bad as  this and that’s what I will be talking about tonight.

PAUL JAMES:

One of the local members, just quickly, I’ll let you go Tony, I know you are busy. One of the local members  said to me yesterday, it’s a good Budget, it’s an Australia Budget, it’s not a people Budget, it’s not a family  Budget, but it’s a good Australia Budget. Somebody else says, another member, said they won’t be here in  12 months.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, how can it be a good Budget if it’s not good for Australian families? In the end, that’s the whole point.  The whole point is to do a better deal for Australian families and if the Budget fails that test it’s a complete  dud.

PAUL JAMES:

Well, that’s the bottom line, isn’t it? Family’s where it all starts. Tony Abbott, thank you for your time.  Good talking to you.

TONY ABBOTT:

Good on you, Paul. Thank you.

PAUL JAMES:

Thanks, Tony.

TONY ABBOTT:

`Bye.
