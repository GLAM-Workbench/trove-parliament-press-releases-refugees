31 August 2011

TRANSCRIPT OF THE HON. TONY ABBOTT MHR  INTERVIEW WITH NEIL MITCHELL,  RADIO 3AW, MELBOURNE

Subjects: Coalition policies; industrial relations; the Government’s failed border protection policies; Craig  Thomson; WikiLeaks.

E&OE……………………….…………………………………………………………………

NEIL MITCHELL:

Tony Abbott, good morning.

TONY ABBOTT:

`Morning, Neil.

NEIL MITCHELL:

Could you still blow it, do you think? You look unbeatable.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, it’s nice of you to say so but, look, no political leader is invincible and no political party is unbeatable.  Now, we’ve got a big job ahead of us. We’ve got to continue to hold the Government to account and we’ve  got to continue to develop our own policies as a credible alternative.

NEIL MITCHELL:

Do you think you’ll be in an election before time? Is somebody going to cross the floor? Is it going to  change that much?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, we just don’t know. This is a very unstable, fragile and unpredictable government. I guess the only  thing that we can be confident about is that they’ll stay bad but you just don’t know what’s going to happen.

NEIL MITCHELL:

Do you feel that people haven’t warmed to you as much as you’d expect when you’ve got such a bad  government? I mean, the party is doing well in the polls, you’re not doing as well as you’d expect.

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, Neil, I think that the role of opposition leader involves a lot of criticism and I think sometimes you  pay the price of having to be the nation’s official critic-in-chief but the party is doing extremely well, the  Government is monumentally in difficulties and, look, I’m happy with the way things are going.

NEIL MITCHELL:

But why haven’t they warmed to you?

TONY ABBOTT:

That’s a question that I’ll leave others to ponder, Neil.

NEIL MITCHELL:

Too much negativity perhaps?

TONY ABBOTT:

I’ll just leave others to ponder. I’m not going to run a commentary on myself, Neil.

NEIL MITCHELL:

Ok, well, you’ve sort of touched on a bit yourself saying you’re the critic-in-chief. That sort of negativity or  that sort of criticism is the role of opposition leaders, I suppose, but it does seem to be leading to a pretty  aggressive environment around politics at the moment.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, it’s interesting you should say that. John Howard was asked this question on 7.30 last night and he  made, I think, the obvious retort - that politics has always been a tough business in this country and if you  go back to 1975, that was very confrontational and adversarial. There were periods…

NEIL MITCHELL:

That was ugly, though.

NEIL MITCHELL:

…in the Hawke Government where things were pretty fierce. I don’t remember being given too much  quarter by the Labor Party when we were in government, either.

NEIL MITCHELL:

I think people are getting a little bit tired of it. I think the voters are getting a bit tired of the aggression and  the unpleasantness and say why don’t you, we are trying to live out here, you buggers get your act together.

TONY ABBOTT:

Neil, people are sick of a lousy government. They are sick of a government which says one thing and does  another and, sure, there’s the notorious “there will be no carbon tax under the government I lead” statement  but everywhere you look, there are commitments that this government has given which it’s then broken. I

3



mean, look at all her commitments pre-election not to have onshore detention centres. Look at all the Prime  Minister’s commitments not to have a Pacific Solution, never to send boat people to a country that hasn’t  signed the UN conventions on refugees, all the commitments on delivering a budget surplus which are  plainly now being retreated from. This is an incompetent and untrustworthy government. That’s what people  are sick of.

NEIL MITCHELL:

We are into campaign mode now, there’s no doubt. It’s a long campaign. When do you flick the switch from  negativity to leadership?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, all the time, I think, Neil, I am saying things which I believe are positive. We took some very good  policies to the last election. They are still our policies: policies to try to boost the participation rate, policies  to try to get young people and seniors off welfare and into work, policies to have more community  controlled public schools and public hospitals. I think if we got the chance - and I hope we do get the chance  - these will make a very significant difference to our country.

NEIL MITCHELL:

Can you promise something for the campaign ahead - no spin?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I’ll put my best foot forward. I guess if that’s spin, then there might be some of it.

NEIL MITCHELL:

No, but you know what I mean.

TONY ABBOTT:

But you can’t blame people for wanting to put their best foot forward. I mean, if I’m trying to sell a Holden  or a Falcon, I’m going to talk about the virtues of the vehicle. Now, I’m hardly going to walk up to voters  and say there’s a few things wrong with our policies…

NEIL MITCHELL:

No, but they’d like a bit of straight talk too, from everybody.

TONY ABBOTT:

Yeah, and look, I would ask them when it comes to spin, put up me, put up the Prime Minister and take your  pick.

NEIL MITCHELL:

Are you a bit too pragmatic at times? Some people say you are trying to be all things to all people. Now,  again, maybe that’s the role of an opposition leader but that’s what I mean about straight talk. This is what I  believe, like it or not.

TONY ABBOTT:

4



Yeah, but sometimes situations are complex and they aren’t amenable to black and white solutions and, you  know, take manufacturing industry. I think we have to have an economy where industries stand on their own  two feet but successive governments from both sides of politics have provided assistance to the motor  industry, successive governments from both sides of politics have provided assistance to the steel and textile  industries, that doesn’t mean that they are unprincipled governments, it doesn’t mean that they don’t support  free markets. It just means that sometimes you’ve got to temper your principal with pragmatism.

NEIL MITCHELL:

Ok. Famously before the last election, you referred to promises that were written down and promises that  weren’t. How will we know what’s a disposable promise in your campaign?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, there shouldn’t be any disposable promises.

NEIL MITCHELL:

No, but you said there were.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, no, I didn’t quite say that, Neil. I said that obviously, things had to be seen in context and, you know, I  made the obvious point that sometimes in the cut and thrust of conversation, you can go a little bit too far.  But no, there’ll be no disposable promises from the Coalition.

NEIL MITCHELL:

So what you say will happen.

TONY ABBOTT:

What we say we will mean and we will deliver.

NEIL MITCHELL:

We will take some calls for Tony Abbott in a moment 9690 0693, 131332. Now, John Howard, as you said,  was on 7.30 last night and he offered some advice to you on industrial relations. We might have to play this  through the speakers. Is your earpiece working?

TONY ABBOTT:

Sure. Yeah, it’s working, I can hear.

NEIL MITCHELL:

Ok. This is former Prime Minister John Howard last night:

JOHN HOWARD:

I do know that at some point this country has to wind back the re-regulation of the labour market. It’s  blindingly obvious that one of the worst mistakes Julia Gillard has made is to re-regulate the labour market.  It’s affecting our productivity and it will therefore affect our competitiveness.

5



NEIL MITCHELL:

Will you deregulate the labour market?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, what we are going to do is we will take a policy to the next election. It will be a strong and effective  one, Neil, and it will be based on solving problems, not ideology.

NEIL MITCHELL:

Will it deregulate?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I think what it will aim to do is solve the problems that businesses have got. Now, I’m inviting  businesses to come to us, tell us what their problems are and one of the things that this policy review process  that Sophie Mirabella and Ian Macfarlane are now engaged on will be about is trying to look at the extent to  which the current Fair Work laws are making it harder for businesses to compete and for people to be  employed.

NEIL MITCHELL:

Is John Howard right? He nailed it pretty hard there.

TONY ABBOTT:

Oh, look, I think there is no doubt that the Fair Work legislation took the pendulum from one side and  swung it right back to the other side but in the end it’s got to be about practical problem solving…

NEIL MITCHELL:

But you’re avoiding the word deregulation. That’s what you mean, isn’t it?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I think we need freedom. I think we ought to be able to trust the businesses and the workers of  Australia to come to arrangements which suit themselves. Now, there’s got to be minimums. There’s got to  be fairness. But there’s also got to be freedom.

NEIL MITCHELL:

Ok. That sounds like a version of WorkChoices.

TONY ABBOTT:

No, no, no…

NEIL MITCHELL:

Why not?

TONY ABBOTT:

6



Look, we’ve gone over this time and time again and the fact of the matter, Neil, is that’s in the past. It’s  absolutely in the past. We want to tackle the problems of now not to dwell in the past.

NEIL MITCHELL:

Ok, but how’s what you’ve described different?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, what I’m saying is that we want the businesses of Australia, the businesses that are currently under  terrible pressure because of the ineptitude of this government and the coming carbon tax…

NEIL MITCHELL:

You are talking about retail, manufacturing?

TONY ABBOTT:

…we want them to come to us, tell us how government can make it easier for them to compete and employ.  Now, if that involves changes to workplace relations, well, we are only too happy to consider it. But they’ve  got to come to us with the problems that they think the existing workplace law is creating.

NEIL MITCHELL:

So John Howard is right. Am I correct there? You think he is right in what he said?

TONY ABBOTT:

John Howard is a very, very shrewd observer and it was great to see him on television again last night.

NEIL MITCHELL:

That’s spin. Is he right or not?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, essentially he is right.

NEIL MITCHELL:

Ok, well he says deregulation is the answer.

TONY ABBOTT:

Yeah, but how that works out in practice, please don’t try to put words into my mouth, Neil.

NEIL MITCHELL:

Ok. What industries are you concerned about? Manufacturing and retail in this area and retailing says that  they need deregulation.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, tourism is obviously under a lot of pressure. I think we’ve had six major tourism resorts close down in  north Queensland over the last couple of months. So, retail is under pressure because of the consumer strike.  Tourism is under pressure because of the high dollar and so, look, we’ve got a lot of problems and I want to  be a pragmatic problem solver. I don’t want to be someone who throws the text book at our problems and  the other thing I should say to you, Neil, while we are at it, if people are anxious about what kind of a Prime  Minister they think I will make, go back and look at the record. I was a minister for nine years in a good  government. I sorted out the Job Network, which was a market-oriented replacement for an old and  ineffective bureaucracy. I put in place the Building Industry Royal Commission which led ultimately to  massive improvements in productivity in the commercial construction industry. As the health minister I  stressed fee for service and also the importance of cost-effectiveness testing and it’s no accident, if I may  say so, that life expectancy increased by more than two years over the course of the Howard Government  and I think the sorts of policies that we pursued had a lot to do with that.

NEIL MITCHELL:

You helped people live longer?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think when you’ve got better drugs, when you’ve got better treatments, I think you do help people to live  longer.

NEIL MITCHELL:

So why don’t people get it about you? Why don’t they like you?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, Neil, you’re putting something to me which I don’t necessarily accept.

NEIL MITCHELL:

Oh, you think they do like you?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, Neil, you make the judgment, mate. I’m not going to run a commentary on myself. Do you like me,  mate? Come on, make my day. Tell me you like me, mate.

NEIL MITCHELL:

Whenever you answer questions I find… I don’t know if I like any politicians, isn’t that awful?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, there you go.

NEIL MITCHELL:

Anyway, that’s not a personal judgment, that’s a professional judgment. Hello Gary, yes Gary?

CALLER:

8



G’day, Neil. Mr Abbott, you said before about comparing Holdens and Fords. As a Holden salesman you  keep on telling me what a lousy job Ford is doing as in Ms… whatever her name is.

NEIL MITCHELL:

Ms Gillard.

CALLER:

Yeah, Ms Gillard. What I’d like you to do is tell me a bit more how good, more often how good the Holden  is?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I drive a Ford myself, I love the Ford Territory. It’s a great car. Look, Gary, what we want to see is, in  broad terms, more responsible government, more responsive institutions and more productive people and at  the last election we brought forward a lot of policies that I thought would bring that about. It involved  cutting out unnecessary and wasteful government expenditure, not going ahead with the National Broadband  Network, not doing things like the pink batts and the school halls. It involved more community-controlled  schools and hospitals. It involved incentives for employers to take people off welfare and into work. Now,  there’s a whole lot of policies there and I would respectfully suggest if you want to go onto the website  you’ll see them.

NEIL MITCHELL:

They’ll change presumably before the next election, some of them?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, we will build on them, Neil. I think there was a great foundation at the last election. Obviously we’re  going to have more to say on workplace relations between now and polling day. But we’re not going to  throw one lot of policies out and bring in a whole new lot. We’re going to build on the ones we took to the  last election.

NEIL MITCHELL:

The asylum seekers, there’s a High Court decision today on the legality of the Malaysian solution. Now, if  the decision goes against the Government what does it do?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, it means that there’s yet another stuff-up to this Government’s discredit. I mean, it’s just one stuff-up  after another, Neil, that’s the problem with this Government. They found a solution, they’ve created a  problem and they’ve been completely unable to correct it.

NEIL MITCHELL:

The phone card, it’s reported in the Daily Telegraph today, $100,000 a month spent for asylum seekers on  phone cards. We can’t deny them access to phones, can we? Do we have to pay for it?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, look, I think there are reasonable questions to be asked about just how much access we give them. I  guess in the end you do have to allow some access to the outside world. But if we stop the boats you

9



wouldn’t have the problem, Neil, and this is basically the issue. We’ve got to stop the boats. The former  government did it with Nauru, with temporary protection visas and with turning boats around where that  could safely be done and I don’t see why we shouldn’t be doing that again.

NEIL MITCHELL:

Are you aware of the case that’s resurfaced this week of Julia Gillard and her relationship in the 90s with an  allegedly corrupt union official? Has the Liberal Party looked at that in the past?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, I’m not aware of us looking at it. I’m only aware of what I’ve read in the newspapers.

NEIL MITCHELL:

Does it interest you or concern you?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, I’m much more concerned about the fact that just last week there seemed to be some payback being  deployed against Kathy Jackson of the Health Services Union. I thought Kathy Jackson impressed people as  a decent, courageous person who wanted to do the right thing by her members and make sure that the rip-off  stopped. Now, that’s what I’m interested in, what’s happening now, the bad things that are happening now,  the fact that the Prime Minister won’t answer questions in the parliament right now. That’s the problem, not  what might have happened ten or 15 years ago.

NEIL MITCHELL:

Even though it would call into question her judgment? It was a long time ago.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, look, I guess if we go back far enough all of us have done some pretty questionable things.

NEIL MITCHELL:

What?

TONY ABBOTT:

Read my book!

NEIL MITCHELL:

Craig Thomson, you’ll continue to pursue him?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, four points. First there’s a Fair Work Australia inquiry on and I think it would be good for the  reputation of Fair Work Australia if it brought that inquiry to a conclusion. Second, there’s a police inquiry  on in New South Wales and we need to let that take its course. But two further points, the Prime Minister  can’t run away from the parliament the way she did last week. I think prime ministers that run away from  the parliament trash the institution and, second, she really does have to explain the things that aren’t being

10



investigated like just what did the ALP do for Craig Thomson in respect of his legal fees and what strings  might have been attached to any money that went to Craig Thomson.

NEIL MITCHELL:

I know often there’s a bipartisan briefing on matters of security and you might not be able to answer for that  reason, but are you aware of this WikiLeaks material on people of interest in Australia as potential  terrorists?

TONY ABBOTT:

Again, I’m only conscious of what’s in the paper today…

NEIL MITCHELL:

Does it concern you?

TONY ABBOTT:

…I do from time to time get security briefings. Look, I haven’t been briefed on it, Neil, and there are lots of  people who are of interest to the authorities, that doesn’t necessarily mean that there is an imminent danger  of an attack.

NEIL MITCHELL:

Speaking of WikiLeaks, there was also a leak that Bill Shorten had been telling the Americans he wanted to  be prime minister. Now that would have surprised you?

TONY ABBOTT:

Yeah, well it’s good to know that the diplomats are digging so deeply into what goes on in countries of  interest and there were reports about Stephen Conroy detesting the current Prime Minister. So look, lots of  things have come out in these WikiLeaks. Some of it I think is unfortunate. Some of it is merely  embarrassing. Some of it is just stating the obvious.

NEIL MITCHELL:

Has Malcolm Turnbull been to see the American Ambassador recently?

TONY ABBOTT:

I would be amazed if many of my colleagues haven’t been in to see the American Ambassador. I have  conversations with the American Ambassador myself from time to time, Neil.

NEIL MITCHELL:

Andrew Robb told me he thinks Malcolm Turnbull as long as he’s in parliament still wants to be leader. Is  that right?

TONY ABBOTT:

And every single member of the parliament is entitled to aspire to be prime minister. I mean, I’m sure  Andrew wouldn’t mind being leader. I mean, Joe Hockey, I mean I’ve got a lot of talented people on my  frontbench who at a pinch could lead the party. But we’re a good team. I think we’ve currently got the best

11



team and, well, I know we don’t look at the polls but I think if you look at the field evidence we’re doing  pretty well.

NEIL MITCHELL:

Malcolm Turnbull said yesterday of course you love polls, you thrive on them. Not you personally,  politicians. Is that wrong?

TONY ABBOTT:

Any politician who says we don’t take any notice of the polls is fibbing, but having said that it’s usually a  mistake to run a commentary on them, Neil.

NEIL MITCHELL:

I know you’ve got to get away and catch a plane. Apple imports, where do you stand on apple imports from  New Zealand?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I understand why people are concerned, I’m concerned. For 90 years we’ve kept them out because of  fears of fire blight. If it’s possible to continue to keep them out in a way that is consistent with our World  Trade Organisation obligations I would like to do that.

NEIL MITCHELL:

Thanks for coming in. Now finally, I’ve seen you on horses a lot lately.

TONY ABBOTT:

Twice.

NEIL MITCHELL:

Where did you learn to ride?

TONY ABBOTT:

I didn’t. I thought that was pretty obvious, Neil, that I wasn’t a great rider.

NEIL MITCHELL:

I’ve had a lot of complaints, you’re carrying the reins over the top of your hands, they should be from the  bottom.

TONY ABBOTT:

Yeah, you’re right. I’m not a great rider. I mean, as a kid occasionally we would go and stay with friends  who lived in the country so occasionally I would get on a horse but I don’t claim to have mastered that  particular skill but it’s great fun.

NEIL MITCHELL:

No more horses?

12





TONY ABBOTT:

No, no, I’m not promising not to do it. I wouldn’t mind learning, Neil.

NEIL MITCHELL:

It’s a photo opportunity?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, you’ve got to give things a go, Neil. I mean, you’ve got to be a participant. You can’t be a spectator in  life and if there’s an opportunity to have a go, let’s take it.

NEIL MITCHELL:

You’ll have a go at anything? Can we get you and Ted Baillieu in a swim for charity, head to head, in Port  Phillip Bay?

TONY ABBOTT:

Is it that pub to pub swim, is that what’s it’s called?

NEIL MITCHELL:

Pier to Pub.

TONY ABBOTT:

The Pier to Pub swim.

NEIL MITCHELL:

No, there’s too many people in that. We just need the two of you.

TONY ABBOTT:

Well look, perhaps we could start off ten minutes before the rest and Ted will finish probably 15 minutes  ahead and I’ll probably get caught up by the mob.

NEIL MITCHELL:

I was thinking of taking you both out in the middle of the bay and throwing you overboard.

TONY ABBOTT:

Dropping us, throwing us overboard and seeing which of us survives or which of us comes back?

NEIL MITCHELL:

We’ll negotiate that.

TONY ABBOTT:

13



Well, the last time I was in Port Phillip Bay was about six weeks ago, the temperature was eight and a half  degrees. I have never been so cold in my life.

NEIL MITCHELL:

Thank you for your time.

TONY ABBOTT:

Good on you, Neil.
