E&OE……………………….………………………………………………………………………………..

TONY ABBOTT:

It’s nice to be here in Port Macquarie. I’m here with my friend David Gillespie who is the National Party  candidate for Lyne. I’m outside the Rural Clinical School which was funded by me when I was the Health  Minister and it’s good to see that the Rural Clinical School is going so well and making such a significant  contribution to the health and medical community here in Port Macquarie.

I want to make two points today. The first point I want to make is that health is a very, very important issue.  All of us know just how important health is because all of us have family members who have been in  hospital or who might be in hospital if we haven’t actually been in hospitals ourselves lately. It’s a very  important issue and it’s absolutely critical that health is managed by people who are competent and the  problem with Prime Minister Rudd is that when it comes to service delivery, he has a proven record of  failure.  The pink batts disaster, the school hall rip-offs and his inability to manage our borders are proof that  you can’t trust Kevin Rudd with Australia’s public hospitals. That’s the first point I want to make.

The second point I want to make is that we’ve had more boats come to Christmas Island. Christmas Island is  now at or over capacity. What is Mr Rudd’s Plan B? What is he going to do about the fact that Christmas  Island is now full? Either he’s going to have to break his promise and start moving unprocessed boat people  to Darwin or he has a potential disaster waiting on Christmas Island.  So he really does have to come clean  with the Australian people and explain to us exactly what he is going to do to solve this problem that he has  created.

QUESTION:

Yesterday Kevin Rudd said that he’d look at the alternative of so-called block grants for smaller hospitals  that may be at risk. What does that then say about his entire health policy? Does it put the whole policy in  jeopardy then?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, that’s right. He was saying for weeks that there was no reason to fear for the future of small country  hospitals under his proposal. Yesterday, on the run, he changes his proposal and the AMA said afterwards  that that was the first they had heard of it. Now, health is too important for amateur hour experimentation.

Public hospitals are too significant to be left in the hands of someone who doesn’t really know what he’s  doing and who won’t talk to the people who do know what they’re doing. So, I don’t think anyone can be  confident that their country hospital is safe under Mr Rudd. Plainly, he is making it up as he goes along.  That’s the last thing you’d want from a Prime Minister.

QUESTION:

If elected, can you guarantee you’d fund 3,500 new hospital beds?

TONY ABBOTT:

You’ll get the Coalition’s detailed health and hospital policy in good time before the election. Certainly  what our hospitals need in the short term is more responsive local management and more beds. Boards and  beds is what our public hospitals need and that’s what I’m determined to give them.

QUESTION:

Should regional and city hospitals be funded under the same sort of formula?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think it’s very hard to fund a small country hospital like Wauchope on the same basis that you might fund a  vast teaching hospital like Westmead, although both Westmead and Wauchope are potentially threatened by  the casemix funding formula that Mr Rudd has supported. I mean, what he really needs to tell us is how  many more bureaucrats will he need in Canberra to run a casemix funding model. Can he absolutely  guarantee that no country hospitals would close as a result of his new funding formula? Can he absolutely  guarantee that the GST grab isn’t going to cause a funding hole for public hospitals? I know in Western  Australia they’re concerned that there could be a half a billion dollar funding hole under Mr Rudd’s GST  grab and the other question he needs to answer is whether this casemix funding is capped or whether  hospitals will be allowed to performed as many procedures as patients need because if they can there’s  obviously an issue for overall hospital funding.

QUESTION:

You’re being criticised for negativity. Can you say today though that you support Kevin Rudd in the push  for more local control? You both seem to agree that there should be more control given back to local  communities like Port Macquarie.

TONY ABBOTT:

I’ll need to see the details before I can say I support it. The last thing I would do is give Kevin Rudd a blank  cheque because if Kevin Rudd gets a blank cheque, well, he writes a very large amount and then blows it.

QUESTION:

And what have you looked at through the Port Macquarie Hospital today?

TONY ABBOTT:

I’ve had a brief look at the emergency department, I’ve had a look at the Intensive Care Unit, the Cardiac  Care Unit and I’ve now just been to the Rural Clinical School here. This is a hospital under pressure. It’s a  fine hospital with a lot of extremely dedicated health staff. They would like to do more and they could do  more if they had more resources. Now, I’m pleased to see that my state colleague, Barry O’Farrell has  committed to a major upgrade of the hospital and I think that’s good and its overdue, but I’m disappointed

that the State Labor government has not been prepared to resource this hospital as it needs and I think one of  the paradoxes in this whole debate is that Kevin Rudd says that the public hospital system is sick and he’s  the man to fix it, but it’s his state Labor colleagues who have caused the problems and why would you trust  Federal Labor to fix the mess that State Labor has created?

QUESTION:

Now, the fourth pod which is what we are pushing for here at Port Macquarie hospital, is it definitely  warranted when you look at all the other needs across Australia? Do we have a unique need here for a fourth  pod or is it the same as needs in other hospitals?

TONY ABBOTT:

There are many public hospitals that need infrastructure upgrades, there are many public hospitals that are  under pressure.  But there has been a very big population expansion here in Port Macquarie and the mid  north coast over the last couple of decades. This hospital was designed for the population of a couple of  decades ago, there’s been no substantial upgrade in the intervening period, this hospital is a significant  regional referral centre. People are coming to this hospital from outside its normal catchment, that’s why I  think the pressures are particularly acute here in Port Macquarie.

QUESTION:

The reports are that Mr Rudd won yesterday’s debate, what’s your reaction there?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well look, the worm never likes Liberal leaders. It didn’t like John Howard, the worm thought that Mark  Latham should be Prime Minister which would have been a pretty ordinary result for Australia. I was very  happy with the debate and I challenge Mr Rudd to have more of them. If Mr Rudd thinks that yesterday’s  debate was such a great success for him, lets more have more. Let’s have one on border protection. Next  week, we’ll have one on border protection.  The week after that we can have one about pink batts and the  school hall rip-off. There are any number of subjects that I would be very happy to debate Mr Rudd on,  including health, and if he thinks he thinks he’s the world’s greatest debater, let’s have more debates.
