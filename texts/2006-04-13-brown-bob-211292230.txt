Greens slam Howard government's harsh new anti-Papuan immigration laws

Senator Brown, 13th April 2006

As predicted by Greens leader Bob Brown on Sunday, West Papuans landing on  Australian shores will be excluded from applying for refugee or asylum seeker status.

"The move by Prime Minister Howard is to appease Jakarta," Senator Brown said.

"This breaches international law and will bring international condemnation. It is  clearly racist," Senator Brown said.

"Acting in accord with Jakarta the Howard government is effectively placing 2  million Papuans under house arrest."

"The Greens will oppose these laws in the Senate with great vigour," Senator Brown  added.

Senator Brown will hold a press conference in Hobart later this morning.
