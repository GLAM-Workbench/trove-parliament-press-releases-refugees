BOB CARR: I've presented today a four-point plan that invites the Islamic world to  express differences over the treatment of Mohamed in a peaceful way.

First: by funding explanations of Islam in Western languages and presenting an  Islamic case in publications for Western readership.

Second: by producing on-line replies to anything considered offensive, disrespectful  or blasphemous. An alternative to demonstrations. A peaceful response to criticisms  of Islam that deliver information about one of the world's great religions in a way that  people find engaging and responsible.

Third: that Islamic nations fund centres in the Western world which promote tolerant  Islam through teaching, through publications - again, an alternative to violence and  an alternative to demonstrations.

Fourth: legal action - where the laws of Western countries allow it, making a point  against an offensive publication by going to the courts, not by taking violent action.

I think the world is facing the possibility of a worsening of the relations between great  religions. But the great religions of the world have got more in common than they  have at odds with one another. Australia presents these ideas to this debate as a  way of Muslims offended by publications that appear around the world, for which  Western governments have got no responsibility, presenting their disagreements in a  peaceful way.

The demonstration we saw in Sydney last Saturday brought forth an awful lot of  antagonism for entirely justified reasons. There is an alternative to demonstrations  and there's an alternative to violence. I want the Muslims of the world to consider  more effective ways of engaging with the West and to responding to material which  they find disrespectful or downright blasphemous.

JOURNALIST: Can I ask you about the freedom of speech, the freedom of press  question on this &ndsah;

BOB CARR: Our societies are very, very different. Those that were formed by the  Enlightenment and by the battles of freedom of speech in the Western world are very  different from those that have a legal system based on religion, the religion of Islam.  And those differences make us interesting! But the things that unite us are in the end  more important than the things that divide us. And there have to be peaceful ways of  engaging about these differences. And that's why this proposal, which is an invitation  to the Islamic world to express its repugnance or its differences about material  produced in the West, has got real merit.

JOURNALIST: What is your reaction to the publication of the cartoons of the  Prophet Mohamed here in France?

BOB CARR: First of all, those cartoons should not inspire any violent response. I  think there's an alternative to Muslims around the world responding with violence.  The alternative is for their governments and their religious institutions to fund  material in the western world that explains what moderate Islam is all about. Their  alternative is second, to post on web sites around the world, a response. More  people will engage with them that way, than will respond to a violent or flamboyant  demonstration and clashes with police in the streets in Western countries. Third,  Islamic governments should fund centres for research and education in the Western  world that engage with scholars and produce publications that explain moderate  Islam. There's a great need for this discussion between faiths. My fourth response is  that, where there's a grievance and where there's a legal remedy, to take the  grievance to court. The fact is that the countries of the West are built on robust  freedom of expression.

The Enlightenment that originated in the streets near where we stand now was all  about the right to say blasphemous things, the right to criticise governments and  churches. And the West is never going to surrender that value, even while we  deplore the shoddiness and the inaccuracy of betrayals of Muslim that appear in  cartoons and nutty films. But what I want to say is that there is a way for moderate  Muslims to engage with the West and make their view heard and to have their  criticisms of material they think disrespectful, or downright offensive, expressed in a  moderate way, in a peaceful fashion. And that's why this four-point plan has got  value and why I'm in a position where I can welcome the support that Foreign  Minister Fabius gave to me in our meeting today.

JOURNALIST: What's your reaction to the fact that the French government decided  to ban the demonstration in France by the French Muslim community?

BOB CARR: Well, all governments have got to take decisions about safety in the  streets. On the bottom line, any government is going to take a decision to see that  law and order prevails in the streets. That's why in Australia I've supported police  action to see that there are no more violent demonstrations. Governments on the  bottom line have got to maintain order. People expect them to do that. The scenes in

the streets in Sydney last Saturday were very ugly. There's got to be a police  response.

JOURNALIST: What about the closure of the French schools and the increased  security around French embassies in the world? Is this the right answer?

BOB CARR: Any government has got to take the decisions necessary to secure the  safety of its diplomats. It's a shame that we've got to do it. Because diplomats are  there to maintain the peace, to have peaceful negotiations promoted at all times. It's  very sad when you've got to safeguard your embassies. Embassies are all about  engaging with a different country and a different people and doing so peacefully.

JOURNALIST: On Syria, the group Friends of Syria is meeting in The Hague to look  for new ways of weakening President Bashar al-Assad's grip on power. Did you  discuss Syria or the possibility of sanctions?

BOB CARR: We had extensive discussions on Syria and Australia supports  humanitarian intervention. We are already the fourth-biggest contributor to looking  after the refugees who've fled Syria into Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan.

JOURNALIST: Do you think that there's an option to offer to the Syrian opposition  more non-lethal assistance of some sort?

BOB CARR: Obviously, that's on the agenda. But the Australian approach, rather  than offering non-lethal support to the Syrian opposition, is to offer more  humanitarian aid, to look after those refugees.

JOURNALIST: Coming back to France, did you talk to Mr Fabius about co-operation, about Australia and France working more closely in the Pacific to crack  down on smuggling and illegal fishing?

BOB CARR: We think we can elevate the whole Australian-French relationship and  a lot of that co-operative work will be devoted towards the Pacific; illegal fishing and  people-smuggling are issues in which we have a common commitment. We will meet  more regularly about common actions in the Pacific.

JOURNALIST: Is it embarrassing to you that the Australian government has  dropped the referendum to recognise Indigenous Australians?

BOB CARR: I won't comment on that while I'm out of the country if you don't mind.

JOURNALIST: Is the government considering giving Nauru extra assistance to  bolster their legal system to deal with the influx of asylum-seekers?

BOB CARR: Talks are taking place between the governments of Australia and  Nauru. I don't want to say anything else about it.

I just want to say something in addition about that four-point peace plan I put forward  … the danger here is that we drift towards a clash of cultures in this world. I think  we've got to avoid that. Muslim nations can take exception to the robust freedom of  expression that is part of the life, part of the values of the West. But I want to urge  them to do it peacefully and to find ways to present their case within the rules of our  society. And I think that can satisfy the offence that Muslims in North Africa and  elsewhere have taken, but without creating angry, anti-Muslim sentiments in Western  countries, where violent demonstrations, attacks on diplomats, cause a lot of anger.

JOURNALIST: Thank you for your time, sir.

BOB CARR: Thank you.
