E&OE……………………….…………………………………………………………………

DIANNE COVENY-GARLAND:

Federal Opposition Leader Tony Abbott is touring regional New South Wales and he’ll be attending a forum  in Tamworth tonight. I’m pleased to say that the Opposition Leader, Mr Abbott, is on the line. Good  morning.

TONY ABBOTT:

Dianne, how are you?

DIANNE COVENY-GARLAND:

I’m very well. I’d imagine I’m a bit warmer than you are at the moment. Nice and cool in Tamworth this  morning?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, I haven’t checked the temperature but I’m sitting in a motor vehicle at the moment with the heater  running pretty high, I’ve got to say.

DIANNE COVENY-GARLAND:

Fair enough. Now, tell me about tonight’s forum. What’s it all about?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, look, this is the latest of the many forums I’ve done since the election. I thought that that Rooty Hill  RSL public meeting style that was pioneered during the election was a very effective revival of opportunities  for the public to subject senior politicians to scrutiny and so ever since the election I’ve been trying to do  quite a lot of these and I’ve basically been doing one every couple of days since the carbon tax was  announced two-and-a-half weeks ago. Now, this will be another one of these carbon tax forums. It won’t be  confined to the carbon tax, but that’s what I’ll be opening the meeting with and then it is essentially up to the  public to raise their concerns with me. I note that the Prime Minister has really shunned these sorts of

forums. In fact, it seems that she’s stopped wearing out the shoe leather, the shoes have got holes in them,  they’ve be thrown away because the message she seems to be getting, Dianne, from the Australian public is  that this tax of hers is totally toxic.

DIANNE COVENY-GARLAND:

Now, the Member for New England and Independent MP Tony Windsor claims that tonight’s forum, that  the whole situation is unfair because tonight’s meeting is by invitation only. Is that correct?

TONY ABBOTT:

Look, my understanding - and it’s Senator John Williams who has organised it - my understanding is that  thousands of invitations were sent out to a whole range of individuals and community groups. I understand  that space is somewhat limited at the club where it is being held. I don’t absolutely know how many  acceptances there have been but I gather that they have been taken on a first-in best-dressed basis.

DIANNE COVENY-GARLAND:

Now, support for Labor increased slightly earlier in the week in a Newspoll in The Australian, sparking  suggestions that people may just be warming to the idea of a carbon tax. Do you think this is the case or just  that there are other things that they are thinking about at the moment?

TONY ABBOTT:

If the Labor Party really believed that the Prime Minister would still be touring the country talking about it.  But, you know, since last Thursday she’s been anywhere but with the Australia people talking about  everything but the carbon tax. Last Thursday she wore out the shoe leather going down to the Press Club in  Canberra. Since then she’s been to a school, she’s been to Tasmania to talk about the forestry agreement,  she’s been back in Canberra to talk about the Malaysian people swap, yesterday she went to Melbourne to  have a photo opportunity with Tony Blair. She seems to be avoiding the public and she seems to be avoiding  talking about the carbon tax. Now, if her shoe leather campaign had succeeded she wouldn’t have stopped it,  she’d be continuing it.

DIANNE COVENY-GARLAND:

Well, no doubt you’ve talked to a lot of people, general business people and members of the community,  about the carbon tax. What’s your general feeling about people, what their thoughts are on it?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, I think the thing that really scares people is the impact on the price of electricity. Now, we know that  electricity prices have gone up by 51 per cent over the last three-and-a-half years, it’s a massive, massive  rise, and the carbon tax is just going to make a bad situation worse. The Treasury says that power prices will  go up 10 per cent as a result of the carbon tax, the New South Wales Treasury, though, says that they’ll go  up 20 per cent. Now, on top of everything else this is a real disaster for Australia’s forgotten families and  because the price of power is built into everything it means that other prices are going to go up and up and  up and this is just going to get worse as the carbon tax goes up and up and up.

DIANNE COVENY-GARLAND:

So how different would the Coalition’s direct action plan be?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, it’s interesting, Dianne, that you ask because today I am going to visit a property out at Spring Ridge  which is about an hour or so out from Tamworth. The farmer there, Cam McKellar, is one of a group of  local farmers who has been over the last few years moving from chemical to organic fertiliser and, in so  doing, improving the agricultural productivity of his property and also storing massive quantities of carbon  in the soil. Now, this is the kind of thing that Australian farmers are already doing without a carbon tax and  what I want to do is provide some additional encouragement, financial incentives, for Australians to keep  doing the smart things they are already doing which have already reduced Australia’s emissions intensity by  almost 50 per cent in the last 15 years.

There are lots of businesses - without a carbon tax, Dianne - that are doing smart things to reduce their  emissions. To give you just another example the big trucking company, Linfox, says that it’s reduced its  emissions by some 35 per cent since 2007, not through a carbon tax but by training its drivers better to go a  bit easier on the accelerator pedal and by making sensible design changes to its warehouses such as putting  in more skylights. Now, if Australian businesses are doing all this anyway without a carbon tax, I think  some additional incentives will even further improve the situation. The problem with the tax is that it’s  actually going to make it harder for business to environmentally innovate.

DIANNE COVENY-GARLAND:

So what about the cost of the direct action plan? Have you looked at the costings of it yet?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, yes, it was costed at the time of the last election at $3.2 billion over the forward estimates period and  about $10.5 billion over a decade. Now, this is a considerable cost, Dianne, no doubt about that. But it’s  going to be paid for from savings in the budget and in a Commonwealth budget in excess of $350 billion a  year I think a billion dollars a year is more than findable.

DIANNE COVENY-GARLAND:

Speaking of things financial, of course the Malaysia swap deal has been signed off this week at a cost of  $292 million to Australia. What are your main concerns about the Malaysia swap deal? Do you think that it  could actually stop the number of boats coming to Australia?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, the first point to make about the deal, Dianne, is that it’s a terrible confession of failure. It shows that  the Government’s argument for the last three years that it’s all overseas factors that are bringing people to  Australia is wrong. My concern about the deal is that I just don’t think it’s going to work. I mean, since the  deal was first announced we’ve had 11 boats and 567 illegal arrivals and if announcing the deal didn’t stop  the boats I don’t think signing the deal is going to stop the boats.

DIANNE COVENY-GARLAND:

And further concerns have been raised this week about children who arrive unaccompanied in Australian  waters on these boats, that they won’t have the protection of a legal guardian once they are sent to Malaysia.  What do you think about that? Do you think it’s unfair to these children, should they perhaps be brought to  Australia?

TONY ABBOTT:

I think there are a lot of very valid human rights concerns about this deal. Now, I don’t think we can be too  squeamish about these things and obviously the Howard Government sent boat people to Nauru and turned  around boats on occasions where it was safe to do so, but this deal takes things a step further and I think it’s

a big step too far. For instance, once boat people go to Malaysia they’ll be dealt with in accordance with  Malaysian standards, not Australian standards. Look, Malaysia is a friend, an ally of Australia, I make no  critical comment on Malaysia but their standards aren’t ours. We would never regard it as acceptable, for  instance, to cane people who have broken some rule and this is par for the course in Malaysia and this is the  kind of thing that boat people will be exposed to under the Government’s policy and I can’t understand why  human rights activists aren’t screaming blue murder over this as they did in the time of the Howard  Government.

DIANNE COVENY-GARLAND:

Now, there’s a column, I think it’s in the Herald today which Rowan Dean is suggesting, it’s an opinion  piece, that Malcolm Turnbull may consider jumping ship to Labor. What are your thoughts on this?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, look, I just think that Malcolm is a senior member of my frontbench team. He’s a long standing, long  serving Liberal. I’m pleased to have him on my team and in common with every other member of the team  he fully supports the direct action policy and he fully opposes the Government’s carbon tax-cum-emissions  trading scheme.

DIANNE COVENY-GARLAND:

Now, the Prime Minister says this morning that world leaders should be envious and most probably would  be willing to, you know, cut off their right arm to be in Australia’s economic position. What sort of an  impact do you think the problems in the US and Europe could have on our economy and is our economy  strong enough to get out of it unscathed?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well look, I think the biggest problem in our economy at the moment is lack of confidence and I think the  big problem with this lack of confidence is the carbon tax. I mean, this is a Government which is making  people’s difficulties worse with an unnecessary new tax. So look, there is no doubt that there are some  problems in our economy, absolutely accept that; problems in the overseas economy, absolutely accept that.  But this Government is making a difficult situation worse with its carbon tax.

DIANNE COVENY-GARLAND:

And just one more for you, because I’m sure your very busy today, we’ve had a lot of pensioners call in in  recent weeks talking about the fact that they’re struggling to keep warm in their own homes and, you know,  with the price of power going up so many simply people can’t risk turning on the heater for fear they won’t  be able to pay their power bills. What would the Coalition do for pensioners when it comes to things like  that? They are saying that if they had more rebates, perhaps that might be one option?

TONY ABBOTT:

Well, the best thing we can do to avoid power prices going up and up and up is not to have the carbon tax,  Dianne and, you know, this is the crazy thing about the carbon tax. At a time when prices are sky-rocketing  the Government is proposing to make a bad situation worse. Pensioners who can’t afford to turn on their  heater or in summer their air-conditioner are going to be very, very badly impacted by the carbon tax. Now,  sure, the Prime Minister says there will be compensation but the best compensation is not to have a carbon  tax and the problem with compensation is that the compensation is inevitably temporary but the tax is  permanent and it will just go up and up and up. Even on the Government’s own figures it’s going to be $23  to start, $29 by 2020 and an astronomical $131 by 2050 and that’s in today’s dollars, it’s not in the  inevitably inflated dollars of those times.

DIANNE COVENY-GARLAND:

Yeah, it certainly makes it tough for many people. Tony, thank you very much for your time this morning.

TONY ABBOTT:

I really appreciate the chance to talk to you and your listeners. Thanks, Dianne.
